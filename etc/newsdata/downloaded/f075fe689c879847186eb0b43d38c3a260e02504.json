Often feigning modesty, he soon generates a cult that he personally develops. Women and even brave men feel overcome in his presence; schoolchildren chant the praise of the father of the nation; artists and writers deify the great leader. Dictators generally come equipped with an ideology, but since they have no principles, only a lust for power, the process of propagation turns it into a mockery.\n\nAlthough dictators often fancy themselves as writers or philosophers, they fail to make the grade as intellectuals, and the Little Red Books they produce are travesties. If they are dictators of the left, their attempts at radical reform bring famine and suffering to the population. If dictators of the right, they go to war, with the same consequence of popular suffering, and lead the nation to shameful defeat. They long to be popular, and put great effort into creating that illusion, but it is all fakery. Surrounded by sycophants, they are friendless, lonely and paranoid. Most of them die a dog\u2019s death, but if they somehow manage to avoid this, people only pretend to mourn them. After their death, they are quickly forgotten.\n\nThis is the collective portrait that emerges from Frank Dik\u00f6tter\u2019s book, the eight chapters of which deal with Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung, Haiti\u2019s \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier, Romania\u2019s Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu and Ethiopia\u2019s Mengistu Haile Mariam. Despite their fundamental similarities, his dictators do have stylistic differences. Stalin allowed streets and cities to be named after him, while Mao did not. Hitler was a teetotaller and Duvalier a follower of the occult. Kim\u2019s floodlit statue towered over Pyongyang, following the tradition of Stalin statues, but Hitler vetoed the construction of statues of himself (thinking this honour should be reserved for great historical figures), and Ceau\u015fescu and Duvalier felt the same. Some dictators\u2019 enforcers wore brown shirts, others black, and still others had no uniform. Mussolini and Hitler excelled as orators, while Stalin was an undistinguished speaker who never addressed mass rallies. Stalin, Mao and Duvalier wrote poetry, Hitler painted and Mussolini played the violin.\n\nDuvalier modelled himself on Baron Samedi, the Vodou spirit of the dead and guardian of cemeteries\n\nIn the chapters on the \u201cbig\u201d dictators \u2013 Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin and Mao \u2013 Dik\u00f6tter dwells on the cult that developed round them. All of them headed a party that borrowed some of their charisma, and their regimes featured a variety of secret police and enforcers as well as cheerleaders and informers. Ordinary people were encouraged to believe that anything bad was done by subordinates without the dictator\u2019s knowledge (\u201cIf only the Duce/F\u016bhrer/vozhd\u2019 knew\u201d). In fact, the dictators repeatedly made terrible mistakes and appear to have had few if any lasting achievements. With Mao and Stalin, the \u201cdog\u2019s death\u201d trope doesn\u2019t quite fit, but Dik\u00f6tter runs a modified form of it anyway. Dying, Stalin lay unattended, \u201csoaked in his own urine\u201d, and \u201cone month after his funeral\u201d, his \u201cname vanished from the newspapers\u201d.\n\nDik\u00f6tter\u2019s sources are impressive, including 16 archives from nine countries, one of them being the former Soviet Central Party Archive (now renamed RGASPI) in Moscow. Despite this, I did not find the Stalin chapter particularly compelling, no doubt partly because I do not share the author\u2019s view that the cult is the most interesting thing about Stalin. When Dik\u00f6tter writes that the dry-as-dust Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party, in whose composition Stalin participated, \u201cdeified Stalin as the living fount of wisdom\u201d, I wonder if he has actually read it.\n\nFor me, the most entertaining chapters of this book were about the dictators I was least familiar with. It is intriguing to read that the remains of Mengistu\u2019s predecessor, Emperor Haile Selassie, were possibly \u201cburied underneath his office, placing his desk right above the corpse\u201d. The stand-out dictator, in terms of entertainment value, is Duvalier, with his personal militia the Tonton Macoutes, who \u201cdressed like gangsters, with shiny blue-serge suits, dark, steel-rimmed glasses and grey homburg hats\u201d for their enforcement duties. Duvalier modelled himself on Baron Samedi, the Vodou spirit of the dead and guardian of cemeteries, and sometimes dressed the part, all in black, with top hat and carrying a cane. Dik\u00f6tter characterises him as a \u201cdictator\u2019s dictator\u201d, by which I think he means the stripped-down model with \u201cno true party\u201d and without the \u201cpretence of ideology\u201d. Certainly Duvalier has a claim to be the reductio ad absurdum.\n\nHe is one of two dictators in the book with dynastic ambitions for their sons, the other \u2013 and more successful over the long term \u2013 being Kim. That seems to me an important difference from the others, including all the \u201cbig\u201d ones, but Dik\u00f6tter does not remark on it. Overall, his argument is that dictators\u2019 cults are not peripheral phenomena but lie \u201cat the very heart of tyranny\u201d. He holds that, contrary to widespread belief, the dictators had not \u201ccaptured the souls of their subjects and \u2026 cast a spell on them\u201d. \u201cThere never was a spell. There was fear, and when it evaporated the entire edifice collapsed.\u201d This seems a strange conclusion when it comes to Stalin, whose successors wrestled with his legacy for decades, and an even stranger one for Mao, the dictator closest to Dik\u00f6tter own field of expertise. But denying any contemporary popularity or lasting impact to the dictators seems to be the main point of the book.\n\nWhile Dik\u00f6tter is explicitly dealing with 20th-century dictators, the stage is set in the preface by France\u2019s 18th-century Sun King, Louis XIV, a great practitioner of political theatre, remembered for his aphorism \u201cL\u2019\u00c9tat, c\u2019est moi\u201d. But if Louis was a model for any of the 20th-century dictators, we don\u2019t hear of it in this book. For that matter we learn little about whom the dictators modelled themselves on (or against) and how they reacted to each other. Yet surely Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin kept an interested eye on each other\u2019s PR practices and on occasion quietly imitated them; and Mao was scarcely indifferent to Stalin\u2019s example.\n\nQuestions of chronology, sequence and influence are not much discussed here. The mid 20th century is generally considered the heyday of dictators of the right and the left, but Dik\u00f6tter does not explore why this might have been so, and even obscures the issue by including chronological outliers such as Mengistu. It is important to study dictators, he suggests, because they are an eternal threat to democracy and freedom \u2013 but not, it seems an acute current threat. \u201cDictators today, with the exception of Kim Jong-un, are a long way from instilling the fear their predecessors inflicted on their population at the height of the twentieth century \u2026 Even a modicum of historical perspective indicates that today dictatorship is on the decline.\u201d That\u2019s reassuring. Perhaps it would be churlish to ask how we got so lucky.\n\n\u2022 How to Be a Dictator is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a325). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.
