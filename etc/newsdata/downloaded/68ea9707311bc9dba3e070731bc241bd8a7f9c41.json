It will be strict. This is an issue of recidivism, a repeat, and it\u2019s about using the same methods again,\u201d Yuri Ganus, CEO of the Russian anti-doping agency, told The Associated Press in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a big problem, and obviously it\u2019s to be expected. If the (Russian) sports authorities can\u2019t find some answers, and I struggle to imagine what those answers could be, I can envision that the decision will be fairly strict.\u201d\n\nThe data handover in January in a sealed-off section of the Moscow lab was meant to clear up years of doping cases. Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency, known as RUSADA, was reinstated in return, against protests from some Western athletes.\n\nTampering would be a breach of trust and could taint the entire data archive so that it\u2019s hard to prosecute cases even for athletes whose files appear untouched.\n\nIf WADA decides foul play was involved, its first step will likely be to re-suspend RUSADA.\n\n\u201cThere will be significant restrictions on athletes, restrictions on the whole sports jurisdiction, on hosting competitions on Russian territory, and the role of officials in sports administration,\u201d Ganus said. \u201cThe worst thing is that it\u2019s now in its fifth year and it will continue for quite some time.\u201d\n\nPossible further sanctions range from monitoring programs to a ban on hosting international sports events or even exclusion from the Olympics. However, that could run into resistance from the International Olympic Committee, which has signaled its reluctance to repeat its punishment of Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics. On that occasion, Russia was officially banned but allowed to send a smaller, officially neutral squad.\n\nWADA\u2019s new powers are based on a code of rules passed last year and they haven\u2019t been tested in court.\n\nGanus is keen to stress that his agency had no custody of the data, and couldn\u2019t have tampered with it. The data was held at the lab, which has never been a RUSADA facility, and sealed off by Russian law enforcement.\n\nRussia has been accused of hacking before in connection with doping. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI alleged in an indictment that Russian military intelligence officers had hacked WADA, the Court of Arbitration for Sport and an IOC official in 2016.\n\nAfter WADA receives Russia\u2019s explanation regarding the data tampering, its compliance and review committee will study the evidence before making a recommendation to the executive board, which meets Nov. 4 in Poland.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The CEO of Russia's anti-doping agency expects \"significant restrictions\" on the whole of Russian sport over alleged data tampering.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/russian_doping_ganus_32757_c0-222-5299-3311_s1770x1032.jpg?75e03b29884b601b55c2dbbfd358080b216b038c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
