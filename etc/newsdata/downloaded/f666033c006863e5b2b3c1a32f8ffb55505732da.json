Despite the bravado that the Englishman exudes, Till smartly works behind subtle feints and solid footwork while creating angles that allow him to capitalize and counter on his opponent\u2019s reactions.\n\nFavoring his crafty left cross, Till possesses a pull-counter that is slightly akin to Conor McGregor\u2019s, typically stunning his opposition when landing it cleanly. The 26-year-old also throws left Thai kicks that tend to flow off of his left-handed threats, but he could get more than he bargains for should he throw them nakedly (without setup) against his current counterpart.\n\nThat said, I do suspect we may see more weapons than Till has typically brought to the table. Admittedly fighting through injuries during the main stretch of his UFC tenure, Till seemed to limit himself to just a few choice weapons.\n\nIn his defense, Till has opened up in more recent efforts, whether it be by showing moves like oblique kicks or staying much more active with his right hand. And given the fact that he\u2019ll have a shorter southpaw foe in front of him on Saturday night, I suspect we\u2019ll see more kicks and lead-sided attacks from Till this time around.\n\nNevertheless, despite Till\u2019s arsenal opening up on paper, I can\u2019t help but wonder if the left hand that knocked him out in London will be looming in his head \u2013 particularly when pitted against another smaller, speedier opponent.\n\nEnter Kelvin Gastelum.\n\nIf this was the middleweight division that boxing offered in the early 1980s, then Gastelum may very well be our Roberto Duran.\n\nAn inherent pressure-fighter who steps up to the plate no matter the size discrepancy, we have seen Gastelum\u2019s striking skills come to fruition under the tutelage of Rafael Cordeiro at Kings MMA. Having a history of transforming high-level grapplers (especially southpaws) into dangerous strikers, Cordeiro has seemingly imparted the same knowledge onto Gastelum, who now incorporates crushing liver kicks to his already potent punches.\n\nStaying in the Southern California scene, we also have watched Gastelum make measurable improvements to his boxing and footwork. Pivoting more off of his right hand, Gastelum will now take better angles, getting the jump on opponents mid-exchange. And akin to the comparison above, Gastelum\u2019s comfort when it comes to boxing in the pocket or countering on the inside has also improved.\n\nHowever, as we saw in Gastelum\u2019s last fight with now-undisputed middleweight champ Israel Adesanya, aggression is a two-way street that he is not beyond being caught speeding on. Should the 28-year-old talent allow Till to find his counters and range early, then Gastelum will likely be forced to find another road to victory.\n\nNext point of interest: Potential grappling threats", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom takes a closer look at the UFC 244 co-main event between Kevin Gastelum and Darren Till.", "authors": ["Dan Tom", "Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "George Garcia", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bd-ufc-244-co-main.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
