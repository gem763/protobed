Defenders are looking nervously over their shoulder for a ball round the corner from Tielemans or a through the channels from the outstanding Ben Chilwell.\n\nThrow in the exciting potential of Harvey Barnes, Ricardo Pereira\u2019s goals from full-back and a fantastic goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, and Rodgers has assembled a remarkably strong hand.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn 2015-16, when Leicester won the title, I didn\u2019t really believe they were going to do it until the last four or five weeks of the season.\n\nBut I\u2019m not going to wait so long to nail my colours to the mast this time.\n\nI think Leicester will finish above United, and I believe they will finish in the top four.\n\nRodgers has proved his near-miss with the title at Liverpool in 2014 was no flash in the pan, and he would have completed the \u2018Treble Treble\u2019 at Celtic if he had stayed to the end of last season.\n\nIn short, he is the real deal as a manager.\n\nI repeat: I am not advocating that Solskjaer is removed from his job at Old Trafford. He deserves to be given more scope to rebuild that squad.\n\nBut when the time is right, and United are looking for their next manager to play fluent, progressive football, Rodgers \u2013 not Mauricio Pochettino, who was first choice when Jose Mourinho was sacked last season \u2013 would be my pick.", "description": "The former Liverpool manager is revolutionising Leicester and could take the reigns at Old Trafford in the future", "authors": ["Robbie Savage", "Image", "Pa", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20387175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Leicester-City-v-Newcastle-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
