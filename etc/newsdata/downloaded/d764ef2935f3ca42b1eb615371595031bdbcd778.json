They\u2019ll do anything to quash the opposition.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re now introducing what I see as a weapon of mass destruction. They simply want to nuke Hong Kong. With this particular law in place, they can do anything.\n\n\u2018They can practically ban anyone, anything, anywhere in Hong Kong. The sweeping powers are simply unlimited.\u2019\n\nA pro-democracy protester throws a box of molotov cocktails at a police station in Tuen Wan district (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nSome of the protesters wearing face masks in defiance of the ban (Picture: EPA)\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling comes one day after thousands staged marches and flashmob protests across the city on Saturday.\n\nA boy aged 14 was shot in the leg by police during the clashes. He remains in a serious condition in hospital.\n\nThe city\u2019s Beijing-backed administrators have pledged to stamp out the protests that have caused havoc in the financial hub since June.\n\nThat authorities are also considering even stricter measures such as curfews and delaying elections as well as introducing new emergency measures to give the state greater powers to stamp out civil disobedience.\n\nThe protests began in June against plans by the city\u2019s administrators to pass a bill allowing people to be extradited to the mainland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mood initially calmed when authorities made the concession and withdrew the extradition bill but since then protests have morphed into calls for full democracy as well as over continued fears the bill could come back.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
