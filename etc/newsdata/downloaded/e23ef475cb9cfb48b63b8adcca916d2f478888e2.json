It is one of the areas hardest hit by the drought.\n\nTo make matters worse, it was in the path of Cyclone Idai which devastated Mozambique and parts of eastern Zimbabwe earlier this year.\n\n'Bartering wire mesh for food'\n\n\n\nAccording to the UN, most of Zimbabwe's 60 districts will have exhausted their staple maize stocks by October.\n\nThe Kufakunesu family and neighbouring villagers have been lucky to have boreholes to draw water for drinking, washing and watering the garden - but the water is drying up due to the heat and scanty rain.\n\nThe UN's World Food Programme has been handing out food parcels - cooking oil and porridge for children under five - and US$8 in cash per month for every family member. But the payouts are only restricted to the so-called lean months.\n\nAt Joni, a neighbouring village, 49-year-old Fungai Mugombe, one of three wives and a mother of seven, used the money set up a simple wire mesh making project.\n\n\"People buy the mesh wire for fencing, and we make a small profit. I sometimes exchange the fences with food,\" Mugombe said outside a cluster of huts where a red bougainvillea adds colour to a bleak dusty landscape.\n\nFreeman Mavhiza, the district administrator, said the government was providing villagers with irrigation facilities and seed for drought resistant crops such as millet and sorghum.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has said the government had budgeted $120m for the production of \"strategic crops, such as maize, soya beans and cotton\".", "description": "In eastern Zimbabwe's parched Buhera district, Omega Kufakunesu's family has been forced to scale down daily meals to just a portion of vegetables and sadza, a thick maize-meal porridge.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9431/b70619f5e0774b9e892fc662dde4fef1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
