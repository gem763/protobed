Americans, instead of blaming themselves -- and confessing that their presence in the region is creating problems -- blame the region's countries or Yemen's people,\" Rouhani said.\n\n\"If we want there to be real security in the region, the solution is that America's aggression cease,\" Iran's president added, before leaving for Ankara to attend a trilateral meeting on Syria with Turkey and Russia.\n\n\"We believe the region's issues can be solved through talks in Yemen, Yemeni-Yemeni negotiations -- they must decide for themselves. The bombardment of Yemeni people must stop,\" Rouhani said.\n\n- 'Maximum lying' -\n\nSince its withdrawal from the nuclear accord, the United States has slapped crippling sanctions on Iran as part of a campaign of \"maximum pressure\".\n\nThe Islamic republic has responded by reducing its nuclear commitments.\n\n\"The Americans have taken the policy of 'maximum pressure' which has apparently turned into 'maximum lying' due to their failures,\" said Mousavi.\n\nThe arch-foes were on the cusp of confrontation in June when Iran downed a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory strikes before cancelling them at the last minute.\n\nIn remarks published Sunday, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' aerospace arm said Iran's missiles could hit US bases and ships within a range of 2,000 kilometres (about 1,240 miles).\n\n\"Neither us nor the Americans want a war,\" Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh said, quoted by Tasnim news agency, which is considered close to the Guards.\n\n\"Of course, some forces facing each other in the field could do something, by which a war could start,\" the commander said.\n\n\"We have always prepared ourselves for a full-fledged war... everyone should know that all American bases and their vessels in a 2,000-kilometre range can be targeted by our missiles,\" he added.", "description": "Iran on Sunday dismissed US accusations it was behind drone attacks on Saudi oil installations, suggesting Washington was seeking a pretext to retaliate against the Islamic republic.  \"Such fruitless and blind accusations and remarks are incomprehensible and meaningless,\" foreign ministry spokesman", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3fKY6rmzmaOlL96ILMzaNg--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/778a12b01f43e83ebfe7d81e51b474bed6cf4cb4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
