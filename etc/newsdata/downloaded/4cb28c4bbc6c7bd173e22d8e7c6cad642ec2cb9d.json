President Trump continually undermines that relationship.'\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn also took aim at Mr Trump, calling his comments 'crass' and 'insensitive'.\n\nMr Corbyn said he would 'mount legal action' in the United States if he were Prime Minister.\n\n'For somebody to be killed in our country and the person who did it to flee to the United States and then claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable,' he said.\n\nMr Dunn's family today branded the President 'insensitive, clumsy and oafish' and said they were 'horrified by his words'.\n\nHarry Dunn (pictured), 19, was killed n a car crash in Northamptonshire allegedly caused by the wife of an American diplomat\n\nThe parents of Mr Dunn are demanding justice after the suspect, Anne Sacoolas (pictured), claimed diplomatic immunity and was spirited out of Britain after the crash\n\nThe President accidentally revealed a briefing note which stated that 'the spouse of the U.S. government employee will not return to the United Kingdom'\n\nMr Trump's bombshell briefing reveals the US has already told Britain she will not be returned to the UK to face justice\n\nSpeaking to Sky News about the briefing note, which Mr Trump accidentally flashed to cameras, the teenager's mother Charlotte Charles said: 'I'm just disgusted.\n\n'I don't see the point in Boris Johnson talking to President Trump, or President Trump even taking a call from Boris Johnson.\n\n'If he'd already made his decision that if it were to be asked and if it were to be raised, the answer was already going to be no.\n\n'It's just beyond any realm of any human thinking.'\n\nNumber 10 had last night put out a statement, published by the Press Association at 8.38pm, which said the two leaders would 'work together to find a way forward'.\n\n'The Prime Minister urged the President to reconsider the US position so the individual involved can return to the UK, cooperate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice,' the statement said.\n\nThe President said he was fully aware of the case and deeply saddened by what has happened, and he expressed his condolences to Harry's parents, who are separated.\n\n'The leaders agreed to work together to find a way forward as soon as possible.'\n\nHarry Dunn's mother Charlotte weeps as she and her family speak to the media yesterday\n\nIn Washington, Mr Trump started a wide-ranging press conference at the same moment that the statement appeared.\n\nAt 9.24pm UK time, he was asked about the case and said: 'The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen.\n\n''When you get used to driving on our system and then you're all of a sudden on the other system where you're driving - it happens. You have to be careful, very careful.\n\n'You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did.'\n\nTraffic drives on the left in Britain and on the right in America.\n\nMr Trump said officials would speak to the driver, 42-year-old Mrs Sacoolas, but reiterated that she had diplomatic immunity.\n\n'So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet,' Mr Trump said.\n\n'It was an accident, it was a terrible accident.'\n\nThe note in his pocket said that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already informed Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab that Mrs Sacoolas would not return.\n\nMr Dunn's mother said: 'You would hope, being a UK citizen, that they would be the ones to help us as much as possible.\n\n'With Donald Trump saying yesterday that every driver has driven on the wrong side of the road at some point - perhaps they have.\n\nCharlotte Charles (left) and Tim Dunn (right), the parents of Harry Dunn, arrive with their partners at the Foreign Office today ahead of the meeting with the Foreign Secretary\n\nThe crash took place in August outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire (pictured) \u2013 a US intelligence hub in Britain\n\n'But not every driver has travelled the distance that Anne Sacoolas did and taken the life of a 19-year-old who was completely and utterly innocent.\n\n'So to us, although it's a personal issue for us, it is more of a unique case than just having accidentally driven on the wrong side of the road so I'm not very happy about those throw-away comments.'\n\nMr Trump has generally enjoyed a warm relationship with Mr Johnson, backing him for the Conservative leadership earlier this year.\n\nThe President called the Tory politician a 'very talented person' and said the former London mayor would do a 'very good job' as Prime Minister.\n\nAs mayor, Mr Johnson had heavily criticised then-candidate Trump in 2015, saying he would not want Londoners to face the 'risk of meeting Donald Trump'.\n\nThe latest diplomatic row has again tested the so-called Special Relationship, a term coined by Winston Churchill.\n\nThe car which crashed into Mr Dunn in August was thought to have been driving on the wrong side of the road after leaving RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, a military base used by the U.S. Air Force.\n\nMrs Sacoolas, reportedly the wife of a US intelligence official, was granted immunity and flown back to America on a private jet from RAF Mildenhall.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police have also asked the US to consider waiving the diplomatic immunity.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab also met Ms Charles and Harry's father Tim Dunn on Wednesday afternoon.", "description": "The parents of 19-year-old Harry Dunn are demanding justice after suspect Anne Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity, but Donald Trump (pictured) dashed their hopes yesterday.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19558424-0-image-a-7_1570740498682.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
