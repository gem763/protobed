Remember, he kicks in a shorts and a shirt, not pads and a helmet.\n\n'It changes things, the precision with which you have to deliver the ball under great duress in a very short period of time - the whole timing aspect of it, there's skill involved.\n\n'The initial trajectory on the ball, they have a hard time getting the ball up. I'm not saying Harry Kane can't do it, and I don't think it's ridiculous - but before we start crowning him as the greatest kicker in the world, let's go through the exercise of vetting that.\n\n'It's the path of least resistance, \"I'm a soccer player so I must be a good kicker\". But they are in for a rude awakening when they delve into the position as there is more to it than meets the eye. If it was that easy, why hasn't it been done by somebody yet?\n\nAndersen believes kane will have much work to do on his technique to succeed\n\nThe former Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints kicker holds a number of NFL records\n\n'With Harry Kane, if he wants to be legit on this then awesome, but you can't tell me Harry Kane knows the intricacies of being an NFL kicker much like I don't know about being a Premier League soccer player.\n\n'It is ludicrous to think you can just step in and do it at that level. I want the fans to understand that I don't feel disrespected, but there is more to it than meets the eye.\n\n'Let's vet it - I'll take him to a training camp in the off-season! I don't know what kind of coaching he would want, but I would recommend that if he is serious about it, get hold of me as someone who has done it for a long time. Let's keep it real, I'll give him a straight shot.\n\n'I'm not debating he doesn't have skill, but I don't think it's fair to say that Harry Kane can just insert himself as a bona fide NFL kicker - there is more to it, he has to earn that just like we earned it.\n\n'I hope I don't sound disgruntled, I'm all for it, but it would be great for the game, the UK and the globalisation of the game. So let me take him and work with him.'", "description": "Legendary NFL kicker Morten Andersen has offered to vet Harry Kane's suitability as an American football kicker - but questioned whether he would be good enough.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/12/19624780-0-image-a-21_1570879144103.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
