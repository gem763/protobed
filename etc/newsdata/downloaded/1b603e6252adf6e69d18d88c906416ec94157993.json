Set yourself up for this morning\u2019s tour with breakfast from the buffet, whilst chatting with your fellow passengers about what lies in store. Churchill famously described Russia as \u2018a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\u2019 and this still seems apt. Formerly a powerful tsarist empire and a Communist superpower, yet today having a cosmopolitan feel very much, it holds a real fascination. European Russia, which stretches from the borders of Belarus and Ukraine to the Urals over 600 miles east of Moscow, even without the vast Russian Federation, is the largest country in Europe. From humble beginnings as a small wooden settlement in the 12th century, despite invasions from the Mongols and Crimean Tatars over the following centuries, the city continued to grow and, by the 17th century, had a population approaching a quarter of a million. In 1712, Tsar Peter the Great moved the capital to St Petersburg and Moscow entered a period of decline, but by the 19th century the city was flourishing again until Napoleon\u2019s invasion. The Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century once more began to transform the city until the Communists imposed a totalitarian regime in 1917 and Lenin moved his government to Moscow. Then came Stalin\u2019s regime of terror, which lasted for a quarter of a century; he oversaw the war machine that helped to defeat Nazism, but also caused the death of tens of millions and the destruction of many historic buildings. A failed coup against Gorbachev in 1991 marked the end of the USSR, and Moscow is now Russia\u2019s richest city. On this morning\u2019s tour you will learn more about its fascinating story. At the centre of it all lies the iconic Red Square with its wealth of instantly recognisable buildings: St Basil\u2019s Cathedral, the glorious colours of its cluster of onion-shaped domes, topped with glinting golden crucifixes, and the turrets and spires of the vast Kremlin fortress soaring high above its huge ornate walls. See the austere granite slabs of Lenin\u2019s mausoleum and the mighty State Historical Museum, housing vast, priceless collections. Visit the famous GUM State Department Store, with its immense glass roof reminiscent of London\u2019s 19th-century railway stations, see the dazzling white fa\u00e7ades and shining domes of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and enjoy panoramic views of this intriguing city from Sparrow Hills overlooking the mighty Moskva River. We will enjoy lunch in a local restaurant, after which you\u2019ll have free time to further explore. Share your stories with fellow passengers over dinner, before retiring to the bar for a nightcap.", "description": "Russia, the world\u2019s largest country, is a land of superlatives matched by its epic history, monumental architecture, incredible culture and sweeping...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://holidays.theguardian.com/tourimg.php?a=img&img=10294221fb3d7e3b543f76c334edad5a"}
