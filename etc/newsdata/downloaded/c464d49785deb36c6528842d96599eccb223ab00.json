She often pairs her designer threads with less-expensive pieces, like jewelry from BaubleBar and a jacket from J.Crew. Most recently, on the second day of her and Prince Harry's royal tour of South Africa, the duchess wore nude Sam Edelman pointed-toe flats that are currently priced at $100.\n\nThe duke and duchess toured the Auwal Mosque and took part in Heritage Day holiday celebrations in the Bo-Kaap district of Cape Town, South Africa on Tuesday, Sept. 24. To visit the first and oldest mosque in South Africa, the duchess paid respect to the Muslim religion by wearing a head scarf paired with a floor-length olive green shirt dress (presumably by a South African designer) and Sam Edelman pointed-toe Sally flats in oatmeal suede.\n\nThe flats are currently available on Sam Edelman's website, Bloomingdale's, Amazon, Zappos and more! According to reviewers online, the shoes run true to size and are very comfortable\u2014perfect for taking a tour of Cape Town or, you know, wearing to the office or out to dinner. The shoes also come in black suede, black leather, lilac suede, white/brown leopard suede, white leather, red leather, snakeskin print and more.\n\n\"Extremely comfortable, they almost felt padded inside. Very simple and perfect for work,\" one Bloomingdale's reviewer wrote.\n\nIn the past, Meghan has repeatedly worn another pair of pointed-toe flats by Rothy's, which are a sustainable shoe made from recycled water bottles.\n\nMeghan and Harry, along with Archie, will be in South Africa through Oct. 2 on official royal business, and we can't wait to see what other fashionable items the new mom has packed for the trip.\n\n%InlineRelated-url=\"https://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2019/09/23/meghan-markle-recycles-blue-veronica-beard-for-south-africa-museum-visit/23818031/\" CTA=\"SEE ALSO\" title=\"Meghan Markle recycles blue Veronica Beard for South Africa museum visit\"%", "description": "The duchess wore the pointed toe flats on the second day of her and Prince Harry's royal tour in Africa.", "authors": ["Ellie Conley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ey9xsZOWCXKwgMWe7zcChQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2557x1679+0+408/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/afdc1890-ded8-11e9-b2be-ad727fe61c0f", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
