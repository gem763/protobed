House Democrats have described that as an improper solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election.\n\nIn her ruling on Friday, Howell also said the House need not pass a resolution formally initiating its impeachment inquiry, undercutting an argument that Trump's fellow Republicans have made in attacking the probe.\n\nDemocrats began the inquiry without putting such a resolution to a vote, but on Tuesday they unveiled legislation laying out procedures for the probe that could be voted on a early as this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday issued a stay that blocks the release to a congressional committee of an unredacted copy of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
