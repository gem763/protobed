Anne Hathaway did the honours in The Dark Knight Rises back in 2012.\n\nDirector Matt Reeves hinted at the exciting casting news by sharing a gif on Twitter of Zoe talking into a phone saying: \u2018Hello?\u2019\n\nZoe as Catwoman is pretty much perfect (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nZoe will be sidling up to Robert who\u2019s the new Batman (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nReeves is set to direct the anticipated blockbuster after taking over from Ben Affleck who stepped down in 2017. Ben, 47, also departed his role as Batman after Justice League leaving a big space for Reeves to pick a new Caped Crusader.\n\nR-Patz was confirmed as the new Batman in May and admitted it was a dream come true to don Batman\u2019s famous cape.\n\nSpeaking to Variety, Robert said: \u2018I\u2019d had Batman in my mind for a while.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s such an absurd thing to say. I sort of had an idea to do it, and I\u2019d been prodding Matt [Reeves]. I kept asking to meet him.\u2019\n\nAlthough, he was \u2018furious\u2019 when the news leaked as he hadn\u2019t even auditioned for the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When that thing leaked, I was f*****g furious.

I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Batman is set to hit cinemas on 25 June 2021.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
