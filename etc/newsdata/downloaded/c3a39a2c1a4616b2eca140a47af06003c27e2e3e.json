Interspersed with these shots are close-ups of Dion facing a mirror and slowly removing her makeup. By the video's end, she has wiped her face clean, looking blankly into the camera, as if to say, \"this is also me.\"\n\nThe song's bridge contains the song's most pointed lyrics, as Dion addresses her imperfections: \"They're part of me, and you are, too/ And I don't really want to choose/ Can you love them the way that I love you?\"\n\nWatch the video, below:", "description": "'This is me,' she seems to be saying, while rocking couture and slowly removing her makeup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299667.1569595455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/celine-dion-imperfections.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
