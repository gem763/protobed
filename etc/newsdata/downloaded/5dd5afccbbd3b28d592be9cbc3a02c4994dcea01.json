Andy Biggs: Democrats' latest attempt to take down Trump will fail, just as their other ones have", "language": "en", "text": "We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their soup de jour, the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation?\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician.\n\nThis is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President\u2019s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes.\n\nHANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE \u2013 HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS\n\nThe media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term.\n\nThe standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops.\n\nThe Mueller investigation did not support Schiff\u2019s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nSo here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable.\n\nUkraine's foreign minister says there were no threats on the call. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation.\n\nAnd, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus.\n\nBut I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine.\n\nWhat do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut, in a bid for moral equivalence, let\u2019s consider the Bidens, who were the purported object of at least part of the phone conversation.\n\nJoe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHow about the projection of the Left? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that.\n\nPrediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.
