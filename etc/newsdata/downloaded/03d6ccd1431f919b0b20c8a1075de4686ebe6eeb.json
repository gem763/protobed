Until that happens, all of this is theatrics,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThe Senate's top Democrat - Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York - on Tuesday slammed McConnell for calling out Democrats on their \"theatrics\" and for failing to call up background check legislation that the House passed in February.\n\n\"Shame on him. There are people who died. Shame on him. Put the bill on the floor and stop ducking the issue and calling names. Shame on him,\" Schumer said.\n\nMcConnell has said on multiple occasions that he will not put anything on the floor that the president has already vowed to veto.\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\n\nWhile Democrats are proposing wide-ranging measures, including universal background checks and federal firearm licensing, some Republicans think their best shot may be to go back to the failed 2013 Manchin-Toomey bill, which would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales.\n\n\u201cThe president is interested in doing something in this space,\" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., told reporters Tuesday morning. \u201cThe idea of having background checks on commercial gun sales makes all the sense in the world and is very broadly supported. I don't think there's any reason to give up yet and I don't intend to.\u201d\n\nToomey and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., co-authored the bill that failed in the Senate following the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which dozens of school children were killed.\n\nBut some Republicans have criticized the bill for being too far-reaching.\n\n\u201cI would urge all of my colleagues to look at the substance of this legislation. A background check on commercial gun sales does not curb the second amendment rights,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nBut he also acknowledged the bill does need work.\n\n\u201cI am not of the view that Manchin-Toomey was handed down to Moses on Mount Sinai. This is open to discussion,\u201d Toomey added.\n\nGOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she thinks Congress will act on gun control \u2013 and soon. When asked if she thinks the Senate will pass something in this session, she responded, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the August recess I had extensive conversations with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and with the White House, and I'm optimistic that we can reach agreement on a package would pass the Senate,\u201d Collins said.\n\nGOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said that he would be willing to consider bills like Manchin-Toomey if he thinks there\u2019s bipartisan agreement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to anything that we can get bipartisan consensus on that also makes sure that we're not overreaching and really beginning to threaten the rights of law abiding citizens of which the majority of people who own guns are,\u201d Tillis said.\n\nMost Republicans admit they can\u2019t get anything done without the president\u2019s buy-in. And they agree with McConnell\u2019s strategy \u2013 saying it\u2019s practical to wait and see what the president decides to do.\n\n\u201cIt's going to be hard for me to convince Leader McConnell to give up a week or so on the Senate floor for something that is clearly destined to fail,\u201d Toomey said.\n\n\u201cThe president has been very thoughtful, he's called me, we've had a number of discussions, he's very interested,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cI think he's learning about this issue and considering he's gotten a lot of ideas thrown at him. So I think he's sorting through this. I'm hoping that the merits of the argument will persuade him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's critically important,\u201d Tillis said of the president\u2019s support. \u201cAt the end of the day he has to sign whatever we send to him.\u201d\n\nABC News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear that on gun control, it\u2019s entirely up to President Trump.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/mitch-mcconnell-gty-jef-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
