REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n\nCaceres has returned to picking beans and corn in one of the most murderous parts of a country with among the highest homicide rates in the world. He can\u2019t stop thinking about 14-year-old Bryan, now thousands of miles north in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt kills you, the depression,\u201d Caceres, now 32, told Reuters, days after returning to his grandmother\u2019s property to live in a nearly-empty cinderblock house with no electricity.\n\nCaceres said he and Bryan had left Yoro with an uncle in the spring of 2018, as violence closed in on the family.\n\nCriminals had killed another uncle in 2011 and raped and beaten Caceres\u2019 82-year-old great-aunt in 2017, according to Caceres and four of his relatives, who said the violence stemmed from a dispute over land raided by a corrupt politician\u2019s thugs.\n\nIn an unrelated case, the corpse of Bryan\u2019s mother \u2013 who was not married to Caceres - was found rotting in a septic tank in 2016, according to local press reports.\n\nNo one appears to have been convicted in the alleged crimes \u2013 not unusual in Honduras, with high rates of impunity compared to other nations.\n\n(For an interactive version see here)\n\nCaceres and Bryan joined the spring caravan last year in Mexico. On May 4, 2018, Jose Caceres said, they surrendered at the San Ysidro Port of Entry to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHandcuffed, he watched as Bryan was led away. He felt as if he had been punched.\n\nThis was during the height of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy - since officially abandoned \u2013 in which thousands of migrant children were separated at the border from their parents. Bryan was sent to a detention shelter in Maryland.\n\nCaceres was flagged - mistakenly, documents reviewed by Reuters show - as having pending criminal charges in Honduras.\n\nAfter he and Bryan were split up, Caceres said, he was interviewed by a U.S. agent, who asked him why he was coming to the United States.\n\n\u201cBecause of crime in my country,\u201d he recalled saying.\n\nBut you\u2019re a criminal, the U.S. agent replied, according to Caceres.\n\n\u201cAnd there was nothing more to be done,\u201d Caceres said. The deportation order he signed barred him from entering the United States for five years.\n\nAn Interpol agent in Honduras told Reuters that Caceres appeared to have an open criminal case, including a 2008 rape charge. The agent spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nThe rape charge had been dismissed, according a Honduran court ruling reviewed by Reuters. But that ruling never showed up at Interpol, the agent said.\n\nMelvin Duarte, spokesman for the Supreme Court of Justice in Honduras, said people must personally visit the Attorney\u2019s General office in Tegucigalpa, the capital, with their dismissals to clear their record. That is something Caceres said he did not know to do.\n\nFrom detention in the United States, Caceres telephoned the Oregon-based Innovation Law Lab, setting off a scramble to help him secure official proof that he was not a criminal, said Law Lab attorney Ian Philabaum.\n\nThe resulting watermarked document from the Honduran judicial authority confirms his record is clear \u201cwith validity at the national level.\u201d It is dated May 15, 2018 \u2013 10 days after Caceres signed his deportation order in California.\n\n\u201cIf I had that paper,\u201d Caceres said, \u201cI would have fought for my son.\u201d\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Ralph DeSio wrote in an email that the agency could not discuss individual cases because of privacy laws.\n\nDeSio added: \u201cApplicants for admission bear the burden of proof to establish that they are clearly eligible to enter the United States.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Honduran migrant Jose Caceres is received by family members as he arrives in his hometown after being deported from the United States, in Yoro, Honduras May 23, 2018.
