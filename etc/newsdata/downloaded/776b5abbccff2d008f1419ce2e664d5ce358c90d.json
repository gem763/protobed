The U.S. decision to impose tariffs on French wines will penalize American consumers, the French wine exporters' federation said on Thursday. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nThe United States has said it will impose 25% duties on an array of European foodstuffs as part of Washington\u2019s response to illegal EU aircraft subsidies.\n\nThe announcement came after the World Trade Organization gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion (\u00a36.10 billion) worth of EU goods annually in the long-running case.\n\n\u201cWe feel hijacked by these retaliatory measures that go against free trade,\u201d French wine exporters\u2019 federation FEVS Chairman Antoine Leccia told reporters.\n\nThe higher tariffs would immediately raise prices by $5 to $10 per bottle. To avoid losing market shares, exporters may need to cut prices, which will threaten many producers, Leccia said.\n\nFrench wine exports to the United States totalled $1 billion in 2018, or about 20% of total exports. Champagne is not targeted by the extra duties.\n\nOf this, Bordeaux wines accounted for more than a fourth of exports, followed by closely by the Bourgogne and Beaujolais origins.\n\nWine bottles sold at prices below $30 would be first hit because the higher price would prompt consumers to turn to cheaper wines from other origins, Leccia said.\n\n\u201cWe can expect significant fall in sales that could be as much as 50% for wines below $15 because it will be very easy to turn to a Chilean or an Italian wine,\u201d he said.\n\nFEVS called on French and European Union authorities to negotiate and find a solution to the dispute, that comes just as exporters are stepping up preparations for a possible departure of the United Kingdom from the EU without a deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad news, especially at a time when we already have to deal with Brexit. Dark clouds are gathering on the horizon.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. decision to impose tariffs on French wines will penalise American consumers who will see a sharp rise in prices while severely hurting French producers on their largest export market, exporters said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436803559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921CQ"}
