Iran rejected the allegations.\n\nMohammad Marandi, a professor of American studies at the University of Tehran, told Al Jazeera that the latest news is \"a very positive step for Iran\" as it's been an open secret that Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE have been allies for years, \"working together behind the scenes\".\n\n\"Whenever Iran would try to point this out, they would regularly deny it. But in recent years [their close ties] have become more open and there's much more evidence.\n\n\"This actually helps Iran because any regime in the region that associates itself with the Israeli regime, its image is hurt significantly. The more open this is, the better,\" he said alluding to widespread Arab resentment against Israel for its occupation of Palestine.\n\nWarming ties\n\nThe latest news follows efforts made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - a strident critic of Iran - over the last few years to improve ties with Gulf nations.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in January 2018, Netanyahu noted: \"There is an alignment of Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. Certainly in my life time, I never saw anything like it and I'm at the age of the State of Israel more or less, so it's an extraordinary thing.\"\n\nIn October 2018, Netanyahu met with Oman's Sultan Qaboos in Muscat in a surprise, unannounced trip.\n\nNetanyahu's statement said the visit came at the invitation of Qaboos, following \"lengthy contacts between the two countries\".\n\n181114134809202\n\nEarlier that year in March, Saudi Arabia allowed an Israel-bound passenger plane to cross through its airspace for the first time ever, breaking a 70-year ban.\n\nIn June a group of Israeli journalists attended the US-led economic conference as was part of the planned Israeli-Palestinian peace deal in Bahrain.\n\nAnd a month later Katz said he met his Bahraini counterpart publicly for the first time on a visit to Washington DC.\n\nHowever, Ian Black, a visiting senior fellow at the Middle East Centre of the London School of Economics, told Al Jazeera that despite the warm relations and a shared common enemy, peace agreements are unlikely to happen \"simply because of the emotive nature of the Palestinian issue across the Arab and Muslim world\".\n\n\"The Israelis are taking advantage of a sense of fatigue from the Gulf side with the Palestinian question. The Palestinian question is complicated; the Palestinians themselves are divided; the peace process\u2026 has been stuck for a long time.\"\n\nBut Black said Israel is boasting \"wishful thinking\" about what Gulf states are prepared to do as there are constraints.\n\n\"[The Gulf states] simply don't want to go public with the sort of relationships we've seen increasingly visible but still limited in recent years.\"", "description": "Israeli foreign minister says 'historic move' will pave way for peace pacts but analysts dub it 'wishful thinking'.", "authors": ["Mersiha Gadzo"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/73cf68b4d0a1400ea5f430928537539d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
