It said other options including banning investments in Chinese companies by government pension funds.\n\n\"To exert extreme pressure and even attempt to force the decoupling of China-U.S. relations will definitely damage the interests of U.S. and Chinese enterprises and people, cause financial market turmoil and endanger international trade and the world economic growth,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang.\n\nNegotiators are due to meet next week in Washington for a 13th round of talks aimed at resolving the tariff war over complaints about Beijing's trade surplus and technology ambitions.\n\nThe two sides have announced conciliatory measures including lifting or postponing punitive tariffs. But there has been no sign of progress toward settling their core disputes. Economists say a temporary agreement is possible but a permanent deal is unlikely this year.\n\n\"We hope that the United States will work with China to deepen economic, trade and financial cooperation between the two countries,\" Geng said. \"We hope the United States will meet us halfway to work out a resolution in a constructive manner.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
