He has scored more than 11,000 runs and claimed over 500 wickets across three formats.\n\nAt the 2019 Cricket World Cup in England, Shakib finished as the third-highest run-scorer with 606 in eight matches, including two hundreds and five fifties.\n\nThe ICC said in its statement here that the player did not report two approaches he received during a tri-series between Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in January 2018 and one more over a 2018 Indian Premier League match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kings XI Punjab.\n\n\u201cI am obviously extremely sad to have been banned from the game I love, but I completely accept my sanction for not reporting the approaches,\u201d Shakib said.\n\n\u201cLike the majority of players and fans around the world, I want cricket to be a corruption free sport and I am looking forward to working with the ICC ACU (Anti-Corruption Unit) team to support their education programme and ensure young players don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.\u201d\n\nShakib recently led a strike by Bangladesh\u2019s cricketers, which they called off a week ago when the country\u2019s cricket board accepted most of their demands including pay rises and other benefits.", "description": "Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan was banned from all cricket for two years with one year of that suspended on Tuesday, after the all-rounder was found to have breached the International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption code.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446182845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0ZN", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
