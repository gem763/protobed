USA TODAY\n\nThe changing of the guard at the quarterback position officially happened on a rainy Wednesday morning in Cincinnati.\n\nA day after learning he wouldn't be the starter going forward, Andy Dalton spoke to the media for the first time as a backup.\n\n\u201cWeird, different, not what I was expecting. It's not how you thought the birthday was going to go. It's an unfortunate situation,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cI don't agree with it. Zac's making the decisions so I'm going to do my part. I'm here, and so I'm going to try and help out Ryan the best I can.\u201d\n\nDalton revealed that Taylor told him that his decision was in part because the team wants to evaluate Finley before the 2020 NFL Draft.\n\n\u201cHe said he has to think about the future with the draft and we have to see what we have in Ryan. That's what it came down to,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cIt's been voiced to me I wasn't the reason for the way the season has gone. I felt like I played well and have done some things to keep this team together in this stretch, but he just feels like he has to figure out what they have in Ryan.\u201d\n\nNFL MIDSEASON WINNERS, LOSERS: Who's made the most of first eight weeks?\n\nMORE: Browns QB Baker Mayfield ends news conference after contentious exchange with reporter\n\nThe fact that Dalton divulged that Taylor was thinking about the future when possessing and ultimately reaching a QB conclusion is an indication that the Bengals are embracing a rebuild. A rebuild that Dalton realistically won\u2019t be a part of.\n\nDalton, understandably frustrated, spoke with the realism that his days as Cincinnati\u2019s starting quarterback could be numbered. He admitted that he wished Taylor informed him of the move well before Tuesday\u2019s 4 p.m. trade deadline, so he and his agent could explore the NFL market for QB-needy teams.\n\n\u201cI think that's an unfortunate thing. It happened three hours before the trade deadline,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cI wish if he was thinking about it at least let me try to see if I could end up somewhere else or at least see if there's interest in possibly getting traded. At that point, the way it was handled there wasn't enough time to even have that happen.\u201d\n\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Dalton has to shift gears, acquiesce to the backup job and support Finley. It\u2019s something that he\u2019s willing to do. He and Finley have already had multiple discussions since the quarterback shuffle.\n\n\u201cRyan was one of the first people I reached out to just to let to him know this has nothing to do with Ryan. Ryan and I have been close ever since he's been here. We've built up a really good friendship. I don't want Ryan to think I have any ill will toward him,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cHe didn't do anything wrong. All he did was be here and show up and do things the right way and they want to give him an opportunity. I'm going to help him out.\u201d\n\nRyan Finley took first-team reps with the Bengals offense Wednesday and threw his first pass to the best player on the roster.\n\n\u201cIt was fun,\u201d Finley said of his first practice as a starter. \u201cI threw my first pass to A.J. Green, so that was exciting. The weather is what it is, but it was fun to get out there.\u201d\n\nThe 0-8 Bengals practiced on Wednesday before taking much-needed break from football. Many of the players plan to go back home and spend time with family. Finley is going to treat the bye week as extra time to prepare for his Week 10 rookie debut at Paul Brown Stadium versus the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n\u201cGoing into a bye week, that\u2019s huge for me. Just kind of a chance to get a fresh start. Zac is kind of preaching a new season, so that\u2019s kind of the mindset. It\u2019s kind of a fresh start. Everybody gets away for a couple days and come back and ready to work,\u201d Finley said Wednesday. \u201cIt gives me a chance to watch more film and get with Zac (Taylor), Alex (Van Pelt), Brian (Callahan) and Andy (Dalton) and just get ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals aren\u2019t easing in the North Carolina State product by any means. His first test is against the AFC North-leading Ravens. Still, the rookie signal caller is looking forward to trotting out there with his teammates for the Week 10 tilt and is excited for the chance to start.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019s part of the game, so it\u2019s something that I just got to get thrown in there and I\u2019ll figure it out. I got a lot of guys around me that know what they are doing. I feel confident about that,\u201d Finley said.\n\nBarring an injury, Dalton\u2019s time as the Bengals\u2019 starter appears to be over. He\u2019s started 128 games over the course of nine seasons for the franchise. He only trails Ken Anderson for the most passing yards in team history and the two are deadlocked at No.1 for most passing touchdowns with 197.\n\nWill Dalton throw another touchdown pass with the Bengals? He doesn\u2019t know. To his credit, he\u2019s committed to the task at hand, which is being a team player as a backup quarterback.\n\n\u201cRight now, I'm just focused on this year,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cObviously there is a lot to come in the next eight weeks and beyond after this year.\u201d\n\nWhat he does know is he still wants to be a starting quarterback in the NFL. The odds of him reclaiming his starting spot in the Queen City aren\u2019t in his favor. Cincinnati and Dalton, who has one more year remaining on his contract, appear to be headed for a divorce after a nine-year relationship.\n\n\u201cI want to have an opportunity to play, I want to have an opportunity to be somewhere where I'm wanted,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cIf that's here great, if that's not then we'll see.\u201d\n\nThe writing is on the wall. Taylor and the Bengals are ready to move in a different direction under center.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
