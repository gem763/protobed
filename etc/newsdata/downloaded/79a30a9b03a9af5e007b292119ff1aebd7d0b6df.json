Fishburners doesn't think so\n\nAccording to the paper, there are five key factors which collectively determine Australia's competitive position to attract and maintain investment in technology: Capital and funding, tax, skills and talent, culture, and regulation.\n\n\"Access to funding and capital can be a life or death issue for an organisation engaging in innovation,\" the paper says, adding that taxation complexity and schemes to promote tax competitiveness can be difficult for firms to negotiate.\n\n\"Access to the best minds and skills is critical to our success as a nation.\"\n\n\"Promoting a culture of startup success is a factor that cannot be created by government, but government can promote ingenuity,\" the paper continued, calling Israel, Singapore, the UK, and the US state of California \"stand outs\"\n\nThe inquiry follows a motion moved by Senator Andrew Bragg in early September that called for the establishment of a committee to look into financial and regulatory technologies.\n\nAt the time, Bragg said the inquiry would be a perfect opportunity to bolster national competitiveness in technology.\n\n\"Australian consumers and businesses will reap the benefits of technology but only if our policies are properly calibrated,\" he said. \"The fintech and regtech sectors are critical to the future of our jobs and lifestyles.\n\nHe said that given the financial sector makes up 11% of Australia's GDP, it is critical the policies are right.\n\n\"FinTech has a big future in providing jobs. Clever and competitive must be our credo,\" he continued.\n\nThe Big Four banks -- ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB, and Westpac -- currently hold around 95% of the entire market share in Australia.\n\nSubmissions close December 31 and the committee is to present its final report on or before the first sitting day in October 2020.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The committee will look into the current state of Australia's fintech and regtech industries, and investigate opportunities to promote \u2018effective and sustainable growth\u2019.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/23/1626dcf1-9359-4194-9388-12e9aaecb9a6/thumbnail/770x578/43d81cc69fbb6268bef836f26be3dffc/money.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
