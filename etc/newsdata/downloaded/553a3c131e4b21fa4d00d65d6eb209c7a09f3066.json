Today, he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival.\"\n\nTodd's dire warning came in response to President Trump's remarks to reporters on Thursday when he called on China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, over their financial ties to the country following his call for Ukraine to do the same.\n\nCNN ANCHOR SLAMS PENCE ON RESPONSE TO TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL: 'WE ALL KNOW' THAT HE'S 'LYING'\n\nSome Democrats claim Trump tried to use $400 million in military aid as leverage to prompt Ukrainian officials to investigate the Biden family's business dealings in the country. A whistleblower complaint about the now-infamous July 25 call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prompted House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is using the power of his office to solicit interference in the 2020 presidential election -- while doing it relying on a debunked conspiracy or two,\u201d Todd continued. \u201cThis is not hearsay or a whistleblower\u2019s complaint, or a memorandum of a phone conversation. You heard the president do it himself on the White House lawn.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"This moment should arguably be a national emergency,\" Todd said. \"The Founding Fathers would have considered it a national emergency if the president publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election. And yet there has been virtually no condemnation for the president\u2019s party at all on this remark, which is remarkable considering the precedent it would set and the lasting damage it would do to our democracy. It is tough to say lightly, but this is the moment where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump tweeted Thursday night that he has \"an absolute right, perhaps even a duty\" as president \"to investigate or have investigated corruption, and that would include asking or suggesting other countries help us out!\"\n\nHe later added, \"This isn't about a campaign, this is about corruption on a massive scale!\"", "description": "MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd kicked off his show on Thursday with a grim forecast of the Trump presidency, declaring \"the national nightmare is upon us.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
