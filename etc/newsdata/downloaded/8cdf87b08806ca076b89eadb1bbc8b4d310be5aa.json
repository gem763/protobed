Before the dissident journalist was torn limb from limb by Saudi regime agents, there was reporter Jan Kuciak, who was shot dead, along with his girlfriend, in Slovakia, for looking too closely into ties between the Italian mafia and the government in Bratislava.\n\nA year earlier there was the case of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist killed in a car bomb in Malta, after reporting links between the government and organised crime; and before that was Michael Douglas Deane, shot dead by Egyptian regime forces while covering the unrest in Cairo in 2013. And then there\u2019s Mexico where scores of journalists have been killed over the years by drug cartels in league with corrupt local officials.\n\nAcross the world last year, 94 journalists were killed, according to the International Federation of Journalists, up from 82 the previous year. So far in 2019, at least 16 journalists have been killed in the line of duty, according to a running tally established by the Committee to Protect Journalists, including in Ghana, Mexico, Honduras, the Philippines and Ukraine.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing is an increasing intolerance of independent reporting, critical voices and investigative journalism,\u201d says Agnes Callamard, the special United Nations rapporteur who investigated the killing of Khashoggi and issued a report about it in June. \u201cThat intolerance is growing in a number of countries, including democracies.\u201d\n\nBut press freedom advocates say that the worst part isn\u2019t that journalists doing their jobs are increasingly targeted for liquidation by the powerful. It\u2019s that in an era of right-wing nationalism and surging authoritarianism, more often than not the perpetrators are getting away with it. Police, prosecutors and the courts are repeatedly failing to deliver justice for journalists who are killed. To press freedom advocates, the independent journalism that is a pillar of civil society and democracy is being disassembled piece by piece.\n\n\u201cWe are watching the building burning down and we\u2019re throwing water at it,\u201d says Leon Willems, director of Free Press Unlimited, a Dutch media advocacy group that provides safety tools to journalists. \u201cAll of our life-saving work does not change a system where it\u2019s almost cost-free to attack journalists. Governments, criminal organisations, armed factions now have absolutely no hesitation to attack journalists. There\u2019s no judicial preventive mechanisms that make people pay for crimes against journalists.\u201d\n\nTo respond to the lack of accountability, Willems\u2019 organisation, along with the French-based group Reporters Sans Frontieres and the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists, have launched a project to employ teams of investigative reporters to examine crimes against journalists and bring them to justice, The Independent can reveal exclusively.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to set up a people\u2019s tribunal where we publicly lay out the entire foundations of cases of journalists being killed,\u201d Willems says. \u201cWe will investigate cases thoroughly. Justice should be done. We see it is not happening.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes at the weekend, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took full responsibility for the killing of Khashoggi, which was allegedly carried out by his own court\u2019s deputies and security officials, but denied that he ordered the killing.\n\nWe are watching the building burning down and we\u2019re throwing water at it. All of our life-saving work does not change a system where it\u2019s almost cost-free to attack journalists\n\nSo far, the crown prince has paid little for his regime\u2019s brutality, which includes extensive surveillance on numerous dissidents abroad and the jailing of civil society activists. Witness the spectacle of world leaders cosying up to the Saudi heir to the throne at the recent G20 summit in Osaka. The 2020 summit is still scheduled to be held in Riyadh.\n\nNations appear eager to return to business as usual with Saudi Arabia, which is among the world\u2019s top exporters of oil and importers of weapons. As of yet, no one has been punished for the murder inside the Saudi consulate, despite an opaque trial reportedly unfolding in Riyadh. \u201cWe have learned that our elected officials are ultimately very prepared to turn a blind eye when they are confronted with a powerful state,\u201d Callamard says. \u201cG20 in Osaka was a very low moment.\u201d\n\nDespite Callamard\u2019s extensive report, Khashoggi\u2019s murder has not been taken seriously by either the Security Council, or any international court. That has angered and frustrated some, even within the UN family. \u201cThe United Nations itself has been silent,\u201d says David Kaye, the special UN rapporteur on freedom of conscience. \u201cWhere is the system? Why could the secretary-general not initiate a high-level investigation himself, as many called for and as Turkey seemed willing to entertain?\u201d\n\nThe Khashoggi matter has highlighted a glaring gap between the international community\u2019s demands for answers, on the one hand, and any real action or ability to enforce justice, on the other. Like in many cases of journalists murdered by powerful players, there appears to be no international will to bring suspects to account.\n\n\u201cThe lack of accountability can only undermine journalist protection, and the willingness of journalists to pursue hard stories in the most dangerous environments,\u201d says Hans Laroes, chair of the European Editors in Chief Network. \u201cIt is a blow to media freedom even though it is only about one killing.\u201d But Callamard insists it\u2019s too early to conclude that justice has failed. She hasn\u2019t given up, and neither should others, she said in an interview from the United Nations headquarters in New York last week.\n\nShe spent most of the General Assembly lobbying diplomats and other organisations to take action over Khashoggi. She is scheduled to be in Istanbul today to join in a public commemoration of the slain journalist on the anniversary of his killing. She continues to promote her report, and advocate for some kind of mechanism to punish powerful political leaders or criminal bosses who wrong journalists and human rights activists. \u201cIt has been only three months for the report, and one year since the killing,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a very short period. Accountability in the judicial sense of the word is going to take much longer. We need to be prepared for a long-term process.\u201d\n\nThe lack of accountability can only undermine journalist protection, and the willingness of journalists to pursue hard stories in the most dangerous environments. It is a blow to media freedom even though it is only about one killing\n\nThe Khashoggi issue has also informed a model of sorts for keeping matters such as press freedom and human rights in the headlines, even when powerful actors would prefer to sweep bodies under the carpet. Over the months of research, Callamard says she learnt a lot about Khashoggi, his complexities and contradictions. Above all, she says, the aftermath of his killing showed her a new way of pressing forward on matters of human rights.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that we are a resilient community,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the capacity and power to keep an issue on the international agenda. And to keep bothering, annoying and weakening a very powerful actor \u2013 in this case Saudi Arabia and some of its friends. We have become more aware of the power we have against very powerful actors.\u201d\n\nSome don\u2019t want to wait for international organisations and governments to get round to taking up the case of murdered journalists. The idea for the people\u2019s tribunal crystallised before the killing of Khashoggi but has taken on a new urgency since. Plans are still in their infancy. Those sketching it out envisage teams of experienced journalists and jurists probing cases together.\n\n\u201cThe ones who reach a verdict should be beyond doubt; it\u2019s not a political thing,\u201d says Laroes, who is also project manager at Free Press Unlimited. \u201cWe will focus on journalists who have been murdered or investigations that have been stalled and those cases where there was no investigation at all.\u201d\n\nThis underlying silent threat is deeply disturbing, not only for what it shows about unaccountable surveillance but for what it shows about the capacity and willingness of states to undermine reporting and association\n\nBy laying out its case to the public, the tribunal would hopefully force local authorities to act, and if not compel international bodies to get involved, perhaps issue arrest warrants or court summonses. \u201cThe problem is the investigations are carried out sloppily or hindered,\u201d said Willems. \u201cWhen local judicial authorities are failing, we need an international organisation to prosecute cases.\u201d\n\nBeyond the lack of justice for the Saudi journalist, there\u2019s another disturbing dimension to the Khashoggi killing that alarms press advocates and human rights monitors: the targeted electronic surveillance of dissidents using sophisticated espionage tools across borders. Saudis allegedly used Israeli software to track Khashoggi and his colleagues, perhaps accessing his communications, and tracking his movements. The scheme was uncovered through the work of a Canadian group called Citizen Lab, which itself became the target of alleged espionage operations.\n\nThe entire episode hints at a terrifying new world of nations using cybertools to hunt down dissidents and thought criminals. \u201cThis underlying silent threat is deeply disturbing, not only for what it shows about unaccountable surveillance but for what it shows about the capacity and willingness of states to undermine reporting and association,\u201d says Kaye.\n\nMedia advocacy groups have also detected a surge in all forms of harassment and direct targeting of journalists, perhaps spurred on by the anti-media rhetoric of populist right-wing leaders such as Donald Trump, the Phillippines\u2019 Duterte Rodrigo, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, and Victor Orban in Hungary.\n\nTrump has called the US media the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and has repeatedly made dark jokes about physically harming journalists. At his rallies, he eggs on excited supporters that are menacing the journalists covering the events. It was only a little more than a year ago that a gunman stormed into a local newspaper in Maryland and killed five members of staff.\n\nLike Trump, allegedly corrupt elites throughout the world see journalists poking their noses into their business as a threat to their lucrative scams. \u201cJournalism is less valued, and there\u2019s so much money around,\u201d says Laroes. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it to kill the stories by killing the journalists.\u201d\n\nLaroes estimated that for every 10 journalists killed around the world, only one case is brought to justice. \u201cThe basic problem we are facing is the problem of impunity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means there\u2019s a kind of reward for killing journalists and stopping the stories that need to be told.\u201d", "description": "The murder of Jamal Khashoggi\u00a0was merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the killing of journalists around the world.\u00a0Before the dissident journalist\u00a0was\u00a0torn limb from limb by Saudi regime agents, there was reporter Jan Kuciak, who was\u00a0shot dead, along with his girlfriend, in Slovakia, for looking too closely into ties between the Italian mafia and the gov", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/12/daphne.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
