She and Mrs Leadsom raised the subject with the bank\u2019s executives in a formal meeting and telephone call.\n\nThere has been an outpouring of anger since Barclays announced it was pulling a cash withdrawal service currently available at 11,500 post offices nationwide. The change is due to come into effect in January.\n\nLord Duncan said: \u2018I believe there is an obligation which should fall upon banks to respect their customers and treat them with the decency they deserve.\u2019\n\nHis comments came amid an outcry in the House of Lords over the decision from Barclays. The Bishop of St Albans, the Rt Rev Alan Smith, said it was a fundamental issue for rural areas and asked what representations had been made to the bank.\n\nBaroness Bryan, who is a Labour peer, urged ministers to ask Barclays to think again \u2018because they are making life difficult not only for people in rural communities, but inner cities where paying for cash machines is extortionate\u2019. The House of Lords debate came after 124 MPs accused the bank of abandoning its most vulnerable customers and adding to the cash crisis.\n\nThis newspaper has received scores of emails and letters of protest, and 11,000 readers have signed an online petition demanding that Barclays performs a U-turn.\n\nThe bank\u2019s top bosses face being hauled in front of MPs to explain the move after concerns were raised about the impact the decision would have on benefits claimants.\n\nMore than 15million cash withdrawals were carried out by the bank\u2019s customers at post offices last year. It is thought the decision to axe the transactions will save Barclays just \u00a37million a year\n\nMore than 15million cash withdrawals were carried out by the bank\u2019s customers at post offices last year. It is thought the decision to axe the transactions will save Barclays just \u00a37million a year.\n\nOn Friday the bank is expected to report profits of \u00a317million a day for the past three months, according to analysts. Its boss, Jes Staley, has been accused of being \u2018out of touch\u2019 and \u2018contemptuous\u2019 of those who rely on his bank\u2019s services.\n\nThe decision is expected to affect tens of thousands of Barclays customers in remote areas even though, \u2018subject to arrangement\u2019, they will still be able to withdraw cash by cheque. It will also leave some post office card account holders, many of whom are elderly or vulnerable, without access to their accounts.\n\nThe financial contract between the Post Office network and banks lasts until 2022. It provides vital income for postmasters, who receive commission for each banking service.\n\nBarclays claims no one will be left without access to cash. It will set up 300 \u2018pop-up banking pods\u2019 and cashback arrangements with 200 local businesses.\n\nn Banks have been repeatedly alerted to \u2018imminent threats\u2019 that their cash machines could be hacked, according to a report out yesterday.\n\nThe Government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre has warned 56 financial institutions that they were at risk of fraudulent withdrawal of funds using cloned cards.\n\nIt said the criminals were very hard to stop once they had obtained valid card details.\n\nThe report also showed the NCSC has defended the UK against 658 cyber-attacks in the past year \u2013 many of them from hostile states such as Russia, China and Iran.\n\nThis brings the total number of incidents dealt with to almost 1,800 since the NCSC was set up in 2016.\n\nHave you or a relative been affected by the decision by Barclays?
