Now they think it\u2019s a false and dangerous ideology. Here they talk to National Review.\n\nChiara was raised by a single mom. She wanted to start hormonal treatment, followed by surgical intervention, but her mom said no. \u201cIt was very much a desperate thing for me. I wanted it right now. . . [I] wasn\u2019t looking forward to the future. It was all about \u2018if I don\u2019t transition, I\u2019m gonna die.\u2019\u201d Now she is so glad that she wasn\u2019t allowed to go through with it.\n\nLike Chiara, Jesse\u2019s parents were against her going on hormonal treatment. She explains how she got involved in transgenderism:\n\nAs a teenager, I was really involved in online activism and the rise of what people now call social justice warriors. I thought that was a very righteous cause to be a part of as a young person. So that eventually lead to me adopting more and more facets of gender ideology into how I perceived myself and others in the world.\n\nHelena had a history of not fitting in and feeling uncomfortable with her body. She had been badly bullied and was feeling very low when she turned to transgenderism. She explains:\n\nWhen I found this trans stuff online I felt it explained everything: why I didn\u2019t like my body, why I was bullied, why I didn\u2019t fit in. Just every question and problem that I had I just felt it was automatically answered. Explained by this trans thing. But not only was it explained it also offered me a solution.\n\nHelena had hormonal treatment for seventeen months. She took high doses of testosterone, which has altered her voice. At the age of 18, she wasn\u2019t thinking about her long-term future. She wasn\u2019t thinking about the serious risks and possible infertility. She has some advice for other young people who might think they\u2019re transgender:\n\nStep back from the activism, the ideology, the community \u2013 think about the reasons why you might feel this way about your body. Because there\u2019s just a lot of people with just glaringly obvious reasons why they don\u2019t like their body\u2026\n\nListen to these brave young women in their own words.", "description": "Listen to these brave young women in their own words.", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Kevin D.
