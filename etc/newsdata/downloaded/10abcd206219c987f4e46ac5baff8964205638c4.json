We think the best way of doing that is with a deal, to leave in a smooth and orderly way.\u201d\n\nMore intense talks resumed this week after Britain softened its stance on the customs status of its province Northern Ireland in order to clinch an accord before the summit.\n\nAn EU diplomatic source told AFP that, under the deal being negotiated, Northern Ireland would remain in the EU\u2019s value-added tax (VAT) area to ensure smooth trade with EU member Ireland.\n\nHowever that would require a new mechanism because the UK will be operating with its own VAT rules.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The EU and Britain looked to be close to nailing down an elusive Brexit deal late Wednesday, just in time to be submitted to a key European summit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Brexit-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
