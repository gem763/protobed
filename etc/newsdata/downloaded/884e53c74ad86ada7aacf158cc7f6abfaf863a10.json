Today, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced the company was banning all political ads. That includes candidate ads but also issue ads by third parties. He made the announcement in a Twitter thread explaning his reasons.\n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nThese challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings. Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nWe considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nIn addition, we need more forward-looking political ad regulation (very difficult to do). Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough. The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nA final note. This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nSeveral points about this. First, I wonder how effective this will be. Twitter is banning ads but not \u201cgrassroots\u201d expressions of support for candidates. So what\u2019s to stop some unscrupulous candidate from paying people to manufacture that grassroots support? So long as Twitter accounts remain anonymous to users, how do you know that Tweet praising Candidate A wasn\u2019t put there by a member of his or her staff? You\u2019re taking the direct ad money out of the equation but money can still be used to circumvent this ban and probably will be.\n\nSecond, this is a pretty direct broadside against Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg has been under pressure from AOC and many on the left for his stance on candidate ads. Just today, the NY Times published an opinion piece by Thomas Friedman saying Zuckerberg was \u201cBreaking America.\u201d\n\nThis is all about money for Zuckerberg, but he disguises his motives in some half-baked theory about freedom of the press \u2014 so half-baked that he couldn\u2019t explain it even when he knew he would be asked about it by a congressional committee\u2026 Just once I\u2019d like to see Zuckerberg look into a camera and say: \u201cI will take Facebook stock down to $1 if that is what it takes to ensure that we\u2019re never again an engine for the perversion of democracy in any country, starting with my own. Facebook is not going to accept any more political ads until we have the resources to fact-check them all.\u201d I doubt he\u2019ll do that, though, because his priorities are profits and power, and he seems quite ready to hurt American democracy to get them.\n\nIt\u2019s probably a coincidence that on the day the Times published this piece asking Zuckerberg to say this, Dorsey came out and said it. But there\u2019s no doubt Jack is aware of the pressure on Facebook and this is a way to improve the image of his brand, especially with the left. I wonder if Zuckerberg will have a sudden change of heart this weekend and decide to follow suit.\n\nThird, only some of the Russian ads that prompted all of this concern about social media directly involved candidates. And obviously none of those involved legitimate groups. It was an astroturf campaign designed to tap into hot-button issues like race and religion. This ban, by itself, won\u2019t prevent outside groups from seeking to whip up outrage on social media it will just make it harder for them to attract attention. They can still create fake accounts and present an image of public support or disapproval of their target.\n\nFourth and finally, all this does in ensure that candidates continue to pour hundreds of millions into television ads which are often extremely misleading. This doesn\u2019t solve what many see as the negative influence of money and ads in politics, it just redirects it slightly.\n\nMaybe this really is a principled decision by Dorsey, but it also happens to be a smart way to stick it to kick his main rival while he\u2019s down and simultaneously get some attaboys from the left:", "description": "\"Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JackDorsey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
