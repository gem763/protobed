If they fail the checks, they would be stopped from taking new customers on.\n\nThere are also new \"fit and proper\" requirements for suppliers, to make sure the people in charge are good enough, and a new principle for suppliers to be open and cooperative with the regulator.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nSuppliers would also need to have plans in place in case they fail, scrutinised by Ofgem.\n\nCitizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement looks like good news for energy customers. Ofgem\u2019s proposals should limit the costs to consumers of failed suppliers, as well as delivering better consumer protections.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a number of cases where customers in debt to failed suppliers were subjected to aggressive debt collection by administrators who were not bound by Ofgem rules. Stopping this from happening will reduce the unnecessary stress and pressure placed on affected customers.\n\n\u201dNew requirements to protect customers\u2019 credit balances should go some way to limiting the costs left behind when firms collapse.\"", "description": "After more than a dozen firms have gone bust, with others banned from taking on new customers until they fix their customer service, energy watchdog Ofgem has stepped in", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12351539.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/angry-customer-on-the-phone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
