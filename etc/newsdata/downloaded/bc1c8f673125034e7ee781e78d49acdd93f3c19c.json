They were playing from the heart today and for their own pride,\u201d said coach Mario Ledesma.\n\n\u201c(The youngsters) were incredible, we really expected that from them and they really delivered. Obviously, we\u2019re out of the World Cup but with those guys, the future is looking good for Argentina.\u201d\n\nThe U.S., who have now managed only three wins in their 26 World Cup games, will hope to end with a fourth from their final game against Tonga but will have to dramatically improve their defence after missing 46 tackles on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually believe those figures but yes, we do need to improve in that area,\u201d said coach Gary Gold. \u201cProbably more important though is to look after the ball better.\u201d\n\nTwo-try captain Blaine Scully added: \u201cArgentina are a very dangerous team when you give them possession and we had too many turnovers. They\u2019re ruthless on that.\u201d\n\nArgentina were on top from the start and Mallia set up the first try when he cut through a ragged American defensive line to feed Sanchez on his shoulder after 19 minutes.\n\nSanchez then set up the second as his short kick took a horrible bounce to wrong-foot Mike Te\u2019o and give Tuculet an unexpected second, followed soon after by his own second and the team\u2019s third.\n\nThe Americans got on the scoreboard at the end of the half when flyhalf AJ MacGinty sent a grubber kick into the corner for captain Scully to scamper on to and touch down.\n\nBautista Delguy had the crowd on their feet at the start of the second half with an outrageous run from behind his own line and through half a dozen defenders all the way to the halfway line.\n\nHe was unable to complete but the next score was only minutes away as Mallia, again untouched, got the fourth, and soon after, and identical fifth after a quick lineout caught the Americans napping.\n\nIt was then Jeronimo De La Fuente\u2019s turn to run in unharried.\n\nThe Americans kept going and were rewarded when Paul Lasike showed great strength to smash his way over for their second try.\n\nBertranou then became the latest to benefit from more great work by Mallia but the U.S. had the final word with Scully\u2019s second.", "description": "Argentina ended a disappointing World Cup campaign on a high as they ran in seven tries to hammer the United States 47-17 with a sometimes scintillating backline display in their final Pool C game on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438749656&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980HC-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
