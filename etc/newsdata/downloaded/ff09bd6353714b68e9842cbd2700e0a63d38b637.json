It is trying to challenge its addition to the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act in an ongoing lawsuit, which it says had restricted its business in the United States \"unconstitutionally\".\n\nWashington says the Chinese company's telecoms gear could be used by Beijing to spy, an allegation Huawei has denied.\n\nThe Trump administration added Huawei to the so-called entity list in May, barring it from buying needed U.S. parts and components without U.S. government approval and threatening to disrupt its operations.", "description": "Huawei drops lawsuit against U.S. over seized equipment: court filing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8902B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
