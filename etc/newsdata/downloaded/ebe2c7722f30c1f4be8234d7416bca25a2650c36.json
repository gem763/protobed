Okurrr.\n\nJIMMY FALLON: Okurrr. Oh, I see. It's almost like OK. But it's...\n\nCARDI B: Yeah. OK. But OK is played out.\n\nMONTAGNE: One reason her patent was denied - the trilling expression is already widely used in public. And by public, I mean Kardashian-level public. It's a favorite of reality star Khloe Kardashian. Here's a compilation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nKHLOE KARDASHIAN: Hashtag #Okurrr.\n\nOkurrr.\n\nOkurrr.\n\nOkurrr.\n\nMONTAGNE: By the way, before the Kardashians, it was used by drag queen Laganja Estanja, a contestant on \"RuPaul's Drag Race.\" Her version didn't have those rolling R's.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLAGANJA ESTRANJA: Okurrr.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I thought it was okurrr.\n\nESTRANJA: The original okurr was just...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Oh, so the bandwidth has expanded.\n\nESTRANJA: ...Okurrr.\n\nMONTAGNE: Drag queen culture played a huge role, in fact, in the word's evolution, according to Rusty Barret, associate professor of linguistics at the University of Kentucky.\n\nRUSTY BARRET: The pronunciation of OK as OK originated in ballroom culture in the 1980s and was a sort of popular catchphrase in gay communities for a long time before the addition of the R occurred.\n\nMONTAGNE: In fact, Barret says most popular American catchphrases originate in minority communities. \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" has been a conduit from drag culture to Twitter to middle schools and launched such favorites as...\n\nBARRET: Serving tea, which means sort of to tell someone's secrets, what they're trying to hide, and throwing shade, which means to be highly indirect but insulting at the same time.\n\nMONTAGNE: Several critics did throw shade at Cardi B for her trademark attempt but not like Laganja Estranja, one of the original progenitors of okurrr. She tweeted that Cardi B, quote, \"didn't steal anything\" and that she, quote, \"was smart enough to capitalize on it. Props to you, mama.\" Okurrr.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NAT ADDERLEY'S \"CANTALOUPE ISLAND\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.
