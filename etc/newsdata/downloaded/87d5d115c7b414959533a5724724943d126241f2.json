Here\u2019s Why I Spoke Up.", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019ve felt robbed of a decade of my life, because I know that the amount of time I\u2019ve spent thinking about three horrible nights of my life is probably the amount of time I could\u2019ve been laughing with an audience. Now I\u2019m 27 years old, and I finally feel that I have the strength to use my voice. I feel lucky that I\u2019ve found it again this soon. I feel lucky to have found positive communities and support. Not all survivors are so lucky.\n\nIn the last two years I\u2019ve started feeling like myself again, finally trusting my own self-worth and confidence enough to work toward the life I\u2019ve always wanted. But I mourn that lost time, and I\u2019m still afraid. Right now it feels like I have the support of the entire world because I\u2019ve spoken out against someone who most people agree is a villain. But I also feel like I could lose that support the moment I might speak out against someone who has their respect.\n\nI\u2019m proud that I spoke up about Harvey Weinstein that night. The overwhelming support I have received has made all of the difference, and it feels like I\u2019ve somehow gotten a little bit of my lost time back.\n\nA lot of the work in calling out rape, rapists and rape culture unfortunately still falls on survivors. We are the ones screaming out while others fall silent, boo or demand we \u201cshut up.\u201d I want other people to speak up for us so that we don\u2019t have to. I want it to become normal to name the elephant in the room. And I don\u2019t ever want to become comfortable sharing space with a monster.\n\nWhen I stood onstage last Wednesday, I remember thinking that I really just wanted to get back to my set. I didn\u2019t want to lose even 10 more minutes of my life to a rapist. I just wanted to let all of the rapists know what I think of them, and then get back to telling jokes. So that\u2019s exactly what I did.\n\nLaughter isn\u2019t just medicine; it\u2019s power. If I can laugh at the monster from my nightmares, if I can laugh at the most powerful predator in the entertainment world maybe my pain doesn\u2019t control me as much as I thought it did.\n\nKelly Bachman is a stand-up comedian.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
