That\u2019s down 2 points since last month and down 6 points since May, when he was at a high of 35 percent support. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June.\n\nSanders climbs back into second with 18 percent (up 8 points since August), followed by Elizabeth Warren at 16 percent (down 4), forming the clearest top three candidate tier seen in this race to date.\n\nThe next tier includes Kamala Harris at 7 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 5 percent, Beto O\u2019Rourke at 4 percent, Cory Booker at 3 percent, and both Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent.\n\nMichael Bennet, John Delaney, and Tom Steyer each receive 1 percent.\n\nThe top picks among self-described moderates and conservatives voting in the Democratic primary are Biden (34 percent), Sanders (14 percent), and Warren (9 percent). \u201cVery\u201d liberals go for Sanders (31 percent), Biden (22 percent), and Warren (20 percent).\n\nPrimary voters under age 35 prefer Sanders (35 percent) over Biden (17 percent) and Warren (14 percent). Those ages 45 and over go even more heavily for Biden (38 percent) over Warren (17 percent) and Sanders (8 percent).\n\nBiden is ahead among whites by 7 points (Biden 26, Warren 19, Sanders 16) and non-whites by 13 points (Biden 34, Sanders 21, Warren 11, Harris 9).\n\nBy a 25-point margin, Democratic primary voters prioritize supporting the candidate who has the best shot at beating Trump over the candidate they like the most (56-31 percent). That\u2019s up from 15 points in March (51-36 percent).\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS\n\nAnd 42 percent say Biden has the best chance of winning. That\u2019s more than double the 17 percent who say Sanders and more than three times the 12 percent who say Warren.\n\nAnd yet, primary voters also prefer a candidate who will take a new approach (49 percent) over one who will build on Obama\u2019s legacy (43 percent), and say backing a candidate who will fundamentally change how the political system works (50 percent) is more important than supporting one who will restore the system to how it was before the Trump administration (46 percent).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden is preferred by a 19-point margin among those who want to restore Washington to pre-Trump, and tops Sanders by a narrow 4 points among those wanting to fundamentally change the political system in Washington.\n\nIn addition, those wanting to build on former President Obama\u2019s legacy go for Biden by 19 points, and he holds his own among those wanting to take a new approach: Biden (23 percent), Warren (22 percent), and Sanders (20 percent).\n\nDemocrats are pretty pleased with their slate of candidates. Most would be very or somewhat satisfied with Biden (76 percent), Warren (76 percent), or Sanders (70 percent) being the party\u2019s nominee, and about 6 in 10 feel that way about Harris (62 percent), Booker (57 percent), and Buttigieg (57 percent).\n\nThe number who would be satisfied with Warren is up 15 points since April. And while overall satisfaction with Biden is down a touch (-2 points), he captures the largest portion saying they would be very satisfied if he is the nominee (47 percent vs. 40 percent for Warren and 37 percent for Sanders).\n\nStill, nearly 4 in 10 Democratic primary voters (38 percent) are hoping someone new will enter the 2020 race, including 36 percent of those backing Biden. That\u2019s about how Democrats felt during the 2008 primaries, when 36 percent wanted to see a new face jump in (September 2007).\n\nHealth care is the number one \u201cdeal-breaker\u201d issue for Democrats, as 13 percent say (without the aid of a list) they must agree with a candidate on it before they can vote for them. That matters, as some of the biggest policy differences between Democratic hopefuls are on health care.\n\nEighty-two percent of primary voters favor changing the health care system to allow every American to buy into Medicare, while 74 percent support largely leaving Obamacare in place (Biden\u2019s position). Fewer, although still a 60 percent majority, favor getting rid of private health insurance and moving to a government-run system (Sanders and Warren).\n\nAmong all voters, majorities favor the public option (68 percent) and Obamacare (57 percent), while views split on a government-run system (46 favor vs. 48 oppose).\n\nPollpourri\n\nWhen asked if it would be tougher to beat Trump if Democrats nominate a candidate with certain characteristics, primary voters say the biggest liabilities would be nominating someone who is gay (50 percent), someone who has strongly liberal positions (50 percent), or a woman (49 percent). Fewer see nominating a person of color (39 percent) or a white man over age 70 (33 percent) as disadvantages.\n\nConducted September 15-17, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,008 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters and 4.5 points for Democratic primary voters (480).", "description": "It\u2019s increasingly more important to Democratic primary voters to beat President Donald Trump than support their favorite candidate -- and former Vice President Joe Biden is widely considered the candidate most likely to give them the White House.", "authors": ["Dana Blanton"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Biden091319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
