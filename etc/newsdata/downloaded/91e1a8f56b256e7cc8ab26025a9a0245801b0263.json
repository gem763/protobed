Some costume department employees also said they made it a point to keep young female singers away from him.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera in New York said it would continue to await LA Opera\u2019s findings before making any final decisions about Domingo\u2019s future at the Met, where he is scheduled to perform starting on 25 September.\n\nA spokeswoman for Domingo accused AP of conducting an \u201cinaccurate [and] unethical\u201d campaign against the singer and described the latest claims as \u201criddled with inconsistencies and, as with the first story, in many ways, simply incorrect\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cDue to an ongoing investigation, we will not comment on specifics, but we strongly dispute the misleading picture that the AP is attempting to paint of Mr Domingo.\u201d", "description": "Dallas Opera abandons 2020 event as 20 women accuse singer of harassing them", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d7eac1f60edc48d942834dd518e3325e625abd6/0_120_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a7bec2c8a44cd9481febba5eb4046a1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
