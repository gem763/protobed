Neither he nor Det Supt Kenny McDonald (right) were questioned by the watchdog\n\nMr Lockwood says that there actions in supervising search warrant applications did not meet the threshold for misconduct.\n\nDefending police officers, he said that they deserve understanding for making decisions 'many of us would be paralysed by' as he called for a presumption of their innocence.", "description": "Michael Lockwood hit out at critics after ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was falsely accused of being a part of a VIP paedophile ring, slammed the IOPC report into London's Met Police as a 'whitewash'.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19462872-0-image-a-51_1570569095705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
