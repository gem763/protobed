Many symbols originate from the world of 4chan and other internet message boards.\n\nOf course, there has been a significant backlash against the database. The inclusion of the \u201cOK\u201d hand signal has alternately provoked howls of rage or peals of laughter. Many have made the point that co-opting the symbol started as a joke, or a meme \u2013 something to troll the \u201cnormies\u201d of the wider world, and a common tactic of the new reactionary right.\n\nThis is despite the fact that white supremacist terrorists, including the Christchurch shooter, have flashed the symbol during court appearances.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Despite this, many former soldiers who joined the right-wing Freikorps chose to display the totenkopf, or fly imperial flags as a demonstration against the nascent democracy.\n\nWhen the Nationalsozialistiche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei \u2013 the Nazis \u2013 emerged in late 1919, it was Hitler himself who chose their most famous iconography. Keenly interested in esoteric and ethnic symbology, he took the swastika \u2013 found in cultures across the world \u2013 and placed it counter-clockwise, at an angle. The colours he chose \u2013 again, red, white and black \u2013 were also \u201cexpressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honor to the German nation\u201d, as he wrote in \u201cMein Kampf\u201d.\n\nIconography of the past was being repurposed in the service of the new, to provide a cohesive link to a supposed glorious German heritage. Along with the \u201cdeath's head\u201d, that appeared on SS uniforms, Futhark, or \u201cGermanic\u201d runes were used by various Nazi organisations.\n\nThe Nazi's opponents were also highly aware of the power of symbols. Along with the red star and hammer and sickle of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, the German communist party, militant units fighting the Nazi stormtroopers adopted their own memorable logos.\n\nThe symbol of the communist Antifascistische Aktion \u2013 two juxtaposed flags \u2013 was displayed in the streets of cities like Berlin, as were the three downwards diagonal arrows of the social democratic Eiserne Front, who counted the Nazis and the Communists as enemies. Both of these symbols continue to be powerful in terms of anti-fascist resistance.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Nazi regime, the new Federal Republic of Germany made it a priority that extremists should never again gather under symbols that had gained such a hateful and horrific meaning. Along with a new constitution, several changes were made to the German criminal code.\n\nChiefly, section 86a forbids the public display or reproduction of symbols of the Nazi regime. Over time, this section has also added communist symbols, white power symbols, and those of several fascist or white supremacist groups, following rulings by the country's federal constitutional court. Songs, hand gestures and slogans have also found their way into the list.\n\nOf course, this action has been met with resistance. Civil liberties groups have, quite rightly, launched several challenges against rulings pursuant to 86a, and it's rarely out of the news for too long. One significant argument made by the groups is that such a move drives groups underground, preventing their surveillance. Moreover, it may give these symbols a kind of subversive cred, making them all the more enticing.\n\nHowever, in my experience, the existence of 86a, and the discussion around what symbols constitute \u201cextremist\u201d or \u201cunconstitutional\u201d is very useful. It pushes awareness of extremist groups to the forefront, and keeps our sense of history alive. For example, debate over whether the symbols of Imperial Germany now signify racist hate makes sure that Germany's pre-war past is under examination.\n\nSo, just because symbols originate from \u201csh**posting\u201d on an internet message board doesn't mean we shouldn't monitor them or attempt to understand how their meaning changes over time. As we've seen, something there to \u201ctrigger\u201d the wider world can rapidly become a banner under which those with a grudge against the world and hate in their heart will gather.\n\nThe \u201cOK\u201d symbol may have started as a joke, but symbols carry weight and power. We must never forget that.", "description": "In the past few days, much has been made much over the Anti-Defamation League's latest move.
