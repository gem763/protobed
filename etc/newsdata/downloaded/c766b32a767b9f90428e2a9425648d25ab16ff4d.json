It\u2019s about a gut feeling for each vineyard: you can do longer skin contact for grapes from rocky soils \u2013 but if you do it with grapes on sandier soils, the wines are too broad.\u201d", "description": "They\u2019re young, ambitious and different from their parents\u2019 generation \u2013\u00a0but they take their legacy, and the weight of expectation, seriously.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5096%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_476%2C$y_149/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e22e509a8f71e9da68b5cec5a8dbef788354edf0", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
