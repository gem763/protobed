The abrupt end of \u201cworking-level\u201d negotiations between U.S. and North Korean officials in Stockholm over the weekend proves yet again that talking isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cKim thought he could sucker us because of the president's statements and because our alliances are in trouble and because he believed Trump wanted a foreign policy success,\u201d said David Maxwell, retired special forces colonel and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cWe have to keep pushing Kim to really conduct negotiations, but the minute we give in to giving him concessions, he has won and we have lost.\u201d\n\nIf the firing of the hawkish John Bolton as Trump\u2019s national security adviser \u201chelped Kim think he could get what he wants,\u201d said Maxwell, the North Koreans at Stockholm yet again confirmed that Kim is not about to give up his precious nukes. The nuclear program was initiated by his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, perpetuated by his father, Kim Jong Il, and is now the centerpiece of Kim\u2019s defense policy.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s foreign ministry left no doubt about the failure of the talks. \u201cWe have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as what happened this time,\u201d said the statement, throwing cold water over the session in Stockholm, which had lasted eight hours and thirty minutes. The U.S. negotiator, Stephen Biegun, had tried in vain to present ideas that the Americans should have known would be unacceptable.\n\nA North Korean official identified only as a spokesperson, possibly First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who is a key figure in talks with the U.S., sarcastically mimicked Washington\u2019s demand for \u201ccomplete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.\u201d The U.S., said the spokesperson, must take \u201ca substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward the DPRK,\" i.e., the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nThe statement wound up with a threat intended to catch the attention of Trump as he contemplates maybe a third summit with Kim\u2013his fourth if you count their impromptu meeting on the North-South line at Panmunjom at the end of June.\n\n\u201c The fundamental problem with Trump\u2019s North Korea efforts\u2014they can\u2019t be called an actual policy\u2014is that North Korea has not even considered giving up its nuclear weapons. \u201d \u2014 David Straub, retired senior U.S. diplomat\n\nBetter watch out, was the message. If the U.S. \u201cagain fingers [points] at the old scenario,\u201d said the spokesperson, \u201c the dealings between the DPRK and the U.S. may immediately come to an end.\u201d Indeed, the statement concluded, \u201cthe fate of the future DPRK-U.S. dialogue depends on the U.S. attitude, and the end of this year is its deadline.\u201d\n\nThe Americans for their part seemed to think another round of talks would be just the thing to head off that looming deadline lest Kim inspire a crisis similar to that of two years ago when tests of nuclear warheads and long-range missiles were the norm. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the U.S. was accepting Sweden\u2019s invitation to meet again in two weeks, but North Korea was having none of it.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is spreading a completely ungrounded story that both sides are open to meet after two weeks,\u201d said the North Korean spokesperson, but \u201cit is not likely at all that it can produce a proposal commensurate to the expectations of the DPRK and to the concerns of the world in just fortnight [sic].\u201d\n\nThe statement decried the U.S. failure to come up with what the North Koreans call \u201ca new calculation method,\u201d dismissing out of hand the litany of proposals that Biegun had put on the table.\n\nThe exact nature of that \u201ccalculation method\u201d was not clear, but presumably it calls for prolonging the moratorium on testing nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles in exchange for relief from sanctions. The North might even suspend its aging nuclear complex at Yongbyon while fabricating warheads elsewhere in a step-by-step process immune from serious inspections and would surely press for an \u201cend-of-war\u201d declaration under which the U.S. would have to withdraw most of its 28,500 troops from South Korea.\n\n\u201c North Korea\u2019s party newspaper called the prototype for a submarine-launched ballistic missile a \u2018time bomb\u2019 and \u2018most fearful dagger\u2019 pointed at its enemies. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem with Trump\u2019s North Korea efforts\u2014they can\u2019t be called an actual policy\u2014is that North Korea has not even considered giving up its nuclear weapons,\u201d said David Straub, retired senior U.S. diplomat in Seoul and Washington. \u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, no amount of Trump sucking up to Kim will make a real difference, and Trump backed off maximum pressure long ago.\u201d\n\nTo veteran U.S. diplomats, Trump\u2019s grasp on reality is far from clear. \u201cAs with many of his other policies, Trump is engaged in fantasy,\u201d said Straub, \u201cbut because he engages in fantasy, who can predict how he will now respond?\u201d Straub asks if Trump \u201cis mad at Pompeo and his negotiating team and will order even more gifts and concessions?\u201d\n\nEvans Revere, who once headed the North Korean desk at the State Department and was number two U.S. diplomat in Seoul, sees the outcome at Stockholm as \u201ca very predictable collapse.\u201d\n\nThe North Korean strategy, said Revere, \u201cappears to have been to take advantage of the U.S. fixation on working-level talks, use the testing of increasingly capable ballistic missiles to pressure Washington, and to issue threats about an end-of-year deadline to ensure the United States team came to the table with a more generous, flexible, and creative offer than the one Trump made in Hanoi.\u201d\n\nTrump, Revere believes, \u201cbacked off maximum pressure long ago.\u201d\n\nUnder the circumstances, the U.S. was in no mood to articulate publicly its proposals at Stockholm. \u201cThe U.S. brought creative ideas and had good discussions with its DPRK counterparts,\u201d said Ortagus at the State Department, citing but not explaining \u201ca number of new initiatives that would allow us to make progress.\u201d\n\nClearly the North Koreans saw all that stuff as diplo-speak for an elaborate ruse to get them to give up their nukes while the North has flaunted its military prowess in short-range missile tests.\n\nTrump has said such tests are not in violation of any understanding reached with Kim at their first summit in Singapore last year, but North Korea most recently has aroused concerns by test-firing a short-range missile from an under-water platform. North Korea\u2019s party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called the prototype for a submarine-launched ballistic missile a \u201ctime bomb\u201d and \u201cmost fearful dagger\u201d pointed at its enemies. In theory, a submarine might be able to launch such a missile, tipped with a nuclear warhead, while submerged undetected off the U.S. west coast.\n\nIn fact, the North Koreans in Stockholm seemed to have gained a measure of revenge for the humiliation of the second Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi at the end of February when Trump walked out without reaching so much as a meaningless statement with Kim similar to the one that ended the Singapore summit.\n\nThat denouement, which the North Koreans blamed on Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, resulted in the dismissal of the top North Korean advisers surrounding Kim, notably Kim Yong Chol, the North\u2019s former intelligence chief, whom Pompeo had seen in Pyongyang, New York, and Washington.\n\nTrump, after his 45-minute closed-door meeting with Kim on the North-South line at Panmunjom on June 30, said Kim had agreed on working-level talks to bring about a real deal on the basis of their summit in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe Kim regime may misperceive from Singapore that it can throw negotiators under the bus, rush into another summit, and extract greater concessions from Trump,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international relations at Ewha University in Seoul, \u201cbut a lesson from Hanoi is that if the North Koreans want sanctions relief, they\u2019re going to have to do the work at the working level.\u201d\n\nThis time, however, the new North Korean negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, a veteran diplomat who had negotiated with Americans in talks in the '90s and then as ambassador to the United Nations, was taking no chances.\n\nThe meeting, he said, had \u201cnot fulfilled our expectations and broke down.\u201d Presumably, on orders from Pyongyang, he was not going to concede anything in return for whatever concessions the Americans might offer. Instead, he staged a walkout of his own.", "description": "Donald Trump's approach to Kim Jong Un was always more show than substance\u2014and the show can't go on.", "authors": ["Donald Kirk"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570479944/191007-Kirk-Trump-tease_sxdu5v", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
