The former Workday Inc. executive is expected to start in the position Monday.\n\nFinance chiefs in recent years have absorbed more duties once assigned to chief operating officers. A recent study found that CFOs improve the quality of a company\u2019s financial reporting when they shoulder COO responsibilities.\n\nThe position at Red Points will be split evenly between financial and operational duties, though there will be an emphasis at first on managing its data operations, Ms. Shishkina said. \u201cFor me, finance and revenue operations are very closely tied, so it\u2019s a perfect combination to find someone who knows both well,\u201d Red Points Chief Executive Laura Urquizu said. \u201cWe are a young company and have to build a larger sales and marketing operation.\u201d The venture-backed company, founded in 2011, has raised $64 million to date, including a $38 million Series C round in April. Its investors include Fidelity International\u2019s investment arm Eight Roads, Summit Partners and Northzone. Red Points, which is developing new technology for monitoring companies\u2019 distribution channels to protect against fraud, is aiming for $100 million in annual revenue in the next few years, Ms. Urquizu said. She declined to provide past revenue performance or a valuation. Ms. Shishkina most recently was the vice president of finance at Workday and, before that, the finance chief for SAP SE \u2019s U.K. and Ireland business. Along the way, she dabbled in operations work, she said. \u201cWhile I didn\u2019t have direct operational responsibility, I had a fair amount of accountability for operational [performance] and performance of sales and product management,\u201d Ms. Shishkina said in an interview. Red Points has offices in Barcelona and New York and intends to open one in Salt Lake City in the next few months, Ms. Urquizu said. The company expects to increase the staff to 270 from 220 by the end of the year. Of the current employees, 30 work in the New York office.
