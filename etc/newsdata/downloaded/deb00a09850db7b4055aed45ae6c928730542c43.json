Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nA retired law enforcement officer is facing multiple counts of rape, torture and other charges in California for crimes committed almost 30 years ago after modern DNA investigative techniques led police to the man they say is a serial rapist.\n\nMark Manteuffel, 59, was expected to be extradited this week after his arrest in Decatur, Georgia.\n\nDistrict Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said Manteuffel is the third cold-case suspect to be identified through genetic genealogy in Sacramento County alone in a little more than a year. The most infamous was Joseph DeAngelo, 72, dubbed the Golden State Killer, who is accused of more than a dozen murders and scores of rapes in the the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\"The message should be clear,\" Schubert told reporters Monday. \"If you committed a violent crime in this community and left your DNA you can expect that we are going to try and solve that crime and bring you to justice.\"\n\nSacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert (Photo: Rich Pedroncelli, AP)\n\nManteuffel was charged in connection with three sexual assaults from 1992 to 1994. Sacramento Police Chief David Hahn said the investigation was continuing, including a review of other unsolved crimes that might be linked to the suspect.\n\nManteuffel worked for the federal prison system for more than 20 years before retiring in 2014, Hahn said. Before that, he had studied at Sacramento State University and done some part-time lecturing there, Hahn said.\n\nIn the first two attacks, in March and May of 1992, the women were assaulted when they arrived home, authorities said. In January 1994, a college student in Davis was out for a run when a man shot her with a Taser, dragged her away and committed \"monstrous crimes,\" Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig said.\n\nIn 2000, prosecutors filed charges using the DNA evidence without a name of the suspect because of concerns the statute of limitations might run out.\n\nHahn said authorities have known for years that the three assaults were committed by the same man. He said it took modern technology matching DNA obtained from crime scenes with profiles assembled through genetic testing companies to nab the suspected culprit.\n\n\"These are horrific crimes committed by a predator,\" Hahn said. \"Without the help of DNA and genetic genealogy we would not have this predator in custody right now, and maybe never would.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/02/cold-case-dna-reveals-predator-90-s-rapes-police-say/1627535001/", "description": "A retired law enforcement officer is facing multiple counts of rape, torture and other charges in California for crimes committed almost 30 years ago.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Published P.M.
