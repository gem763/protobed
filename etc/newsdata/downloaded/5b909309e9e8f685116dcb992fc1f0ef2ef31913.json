It says it also wants to repatriate some of the 3.6 million refugees currently residing on its soil to the area.\n\nLast week, Turkey and Russia agreed on a deal to halt the Turkish offensive. The agreement requires that Russian military police and Syrian border guards remove the Kurdish forces from within 30km (19 miles) of the Turkish border by next Tuesday.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Maas described the military offensive as an \"invasion\" and Germany has said it will not issue any new permits for military equipment that could be used by Turkey in Syria.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu said Ankara expects Berlin to \"act with the spirit of alliance\" and \"side with Turkey in its fight against terrorism\".\n\n\"We are having difficulty explaining to our people that Germany is siding with a terror organisation instead of Turkey despite understanding Turkey's legitimate security concerns,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\nThe German foreign minister also said Ankara reassured Berlin that it will comply with international law as part of Turkey's plans to relocate refugees to the planned \"safe zone\" in northeastern Syria.\n\nTurkey will handle the situation in a \"humanitarian way\", Cavusoglu said.\n\n\n\n191022180033274\n\nEarlier in the week, rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch alleged in separate reports that the Turkish government has been forcibly deporting refugees to war-torn Syria.\n\nPoles apart\n\nAl Jazeera's Osama Bin Javid, reporting from the Turkish-Syrian border, said that the meeting between two foreign ministers was an effort for the sides to build bridges despite their divergent positions on recent developments in Syria.\n\n\"The European Union and Germany are concerned about the territorial integrity of Syria and forcible return of refugees,\" he said.\n\n\"Meanwhile, Turkey insists that the EU allies are not standing behind it when it needs them the most. It wants the EU backing while its fight against what is says 'terrorists' on the border.\"", "description": "Turkish foreign minister says trust in Germany has been 'shaken' following recent criticism of offensive in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/26/7b7bd5f113f34c6990c38cc1e6e831cc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
