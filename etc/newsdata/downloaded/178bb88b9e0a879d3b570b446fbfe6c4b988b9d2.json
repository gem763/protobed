It has 34 jets parked in the California desert awaiting approval to fly again, and 41 more that were scheduled for delivery this year. American has 24 MAX jets and 16 more due this year.\n\nFerguson, who became president of APA in July, is working closely with American to ensure that its MAX jets are safely returned to service once the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approves them.\n\nBoeing is developing a software fix and new pilot training that must be reviewed by the FAA. The manufacturer has repeatedly said it is targeting the fourth quarter for the plane to return to service.\n\nOnce the FAA gives 737 MAX approval, American will need around 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flight, APA representatives said.\n\nFor Southwest, with over 10,000 737 pilots, it may take between 45 to 60 days following approval before the plane resumes commercial flights, representatives from the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said at the conference.\n\n(Reporting by Tracy Rucinski in Plano, Texas; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "description": "Southwest Airlines' CEO said last week that pilots would receive a share of any compensation the carrier receives from Boeing", "authors": ["Tracy Rucinski"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9495b68bd8ec03ee2023c0?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
