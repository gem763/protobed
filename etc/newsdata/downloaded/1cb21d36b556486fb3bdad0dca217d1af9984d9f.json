NSO has denied the allegations.\n\n\"In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\" NSO said in a statement.\n\n\"The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.\"\n\nWhatsApp said the attack exploited its video calling system in order to send malware to the mobile devices of a number of users. The malware would allow NSO's clients - said to be governments and intelligence organisations - to secretly spy on a phone's owner, opening their digital lives up to official scrutiny.\n\nWhatsApp is used by some 1.5 billion people monthly and has often touted a high level of security, including end-to-end encrypted messages that cannot be deciphered by WhatsApp or other third parties.\n\nNSO's spyware has repeatedly been found deployed to hack journalists, lawyers, human-rights activists, political dissidents and rivals.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report last year, the UAE had asked NSO to hack into the phones of the Qatari emir and a Saudi prince among other political and regional rivals.\n\nThe spyware was also implicated in the gruesome killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.", "description": "WhatsApp accused the surveillance company NSO of facilitating government hacking sprees in 20 countries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/1/21/a9f0ba5ccc07423090c3075eb0a72996_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
