On Wednesday afternoon, Reuters reported that China had \u201clowered its expectations\u201d for progress on trade talks in reaction to the Commerce Department blacklisting dozens of Chinese tech companies over human rights violations.\n\nSpeaking to the press on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he was not lowering his own expectations for the talks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m driving a tough deal because I have to,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI told that to President Xi. I said, \u2018This can\u2019t be like a 5o-50 deal. If it\u2019s a 50-50 deal, you\u2019re up here and we\u2019re down here. If it\u2019s a 50-50 deal, it doesn\u2019t work. This has to be a better deal from our standpoint.\u201d\n\nMidlevel officials from the Trump administration and China have been meeting last week and this week to set the stage for the high-level meetings set to begin on Wednesday. But few in the Trump administration are expecting a break-through, according to sources close to the talks who spoke with Breitbart News .\n\nThere\u2019s some concern that the talks could go awry, breaking-off early if China plays hardball. That is what happened in Shanghai this summer when U.S. officials quickly realized that the talks were not going to be productive. After U.S. officials debriefed the president on the talks, President Trump quickly announced a new round of tariff hikes.\n\nIt was hoped early on that more time and higher tariffs would convince China to come to the next round of negotiations with a more open attitude toward the reforms with regard to forced technology transfer and industrial policy that the U.S. has demanded from the start of the trade fight last year. Those hopes have largely faded over the past two weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAn agreement is still possible, according to people involved in the talks. But it largely depends on what China is willing to negotiate when high-level talks begin Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on whether China is willing to make a deal,\u201d an official said, echoing the words of President Trump from earlier this week. \u201cNot many of us are confident they\u2019re there yet.\u201d", "description": "Early hopes that China might be ready for a trade deal have faded over the past two weeks, administration officials said. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-872031456-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
