Good luck.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant Hollywood Reporter excerpt (emphasis mine):\n\nWeinstein also attempted to leverage his long-term relationship with Hillary Clinton to pressure Farrow, he writes. In summer 2017, while Farrow was trying to lock down an interview with Clinton for his foreign policy book \u2014 while also still working on the Weinstein story \u2014 he received a call from Clinton\u2019s publicist, Nick Merrill, who told him that the \u201cbig story\u201d Farrow was working on was a \u201cconcern for us.\u201d Then, in September 2017, according to an email cited in the book, Weinstein wrote to Deborah Turness, the ex-president of NBC News who now runs NBC News International, to propose a docuseries on Clinton. \u201cYour Hillary doc series sounds absolutely stunning,\u201d Turness responded. Weinstein\u2019s tentacles even stretched to Farrow\u2019s own estranged father. Days before the Times story broke, Weinstein is said to have called Allen on a film set in Central Park, soliciting advice about how to deal with his son. Allen declined: \u201cJeez, I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck.\u201d\n\nPlease note that Merrill is Hillary\u2019s longtime publicist. He works for her, and it seems unlikely he would do such a thing without her instructions. What\u2019s more, as of now, Merrill has not denied the reporting.\n\nTo understand just how awful Hillary\u2019s behavior is here, you have to keep in mind the context of the time, of what was happening in 2017.\n\nTo begin with, as Breitbart News reported in December 2017, there are credible reports Hillary Clinton had known about Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct and abuse going back to her failed 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nFrom the far-left New York Times:\n\n[T]wo prominent women said they warned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team. In 2016, Lena Dunham, the writer and actress, said she was troubled by the producer\u2019s visible presence during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential run, hosting fund-raisers and appearing at campaign events. \u2026 \u201cI just want you to let you know that Harvey\u2019s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,\u201d Ms. Dunham said she told Kristina Schake, the campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. She recalled adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it\u2019s an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault.\u201d \u2026 Ms. Dunham said she also warned Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton who was leading efforts with celebrity campaigners. As far as Ms. Dunham could tell, the campaign had not responded to her concerns about Mr. Weinstein. Weeks before Election Day, the producer helped organize a star-packed fund-raiser: an evening on Broadway with Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway and others.\n\nBut even without this reporting, what we also know is that Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct and abuse were no secret in Hollywood and Washington, DC. Report after report after report confirm that \u201ceveryone knew,\u201d but no one did anything because 1) Weinstein had the power to make or break your Hollywood career and 2) Weinstein raised a ton of money for Democrats \u2014 most especially, the Clintons; most especially, Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn top of that, at the time, it was no secret Farrow was working on what would be a Pulitzer-winning Weinstein expos\u00e9. Everyone knew because Farrow was reaching out to everyone to put the story together.\n\nAccording to Farrow, Weinstein understood this report could completely destroy his life, career, and reputation (which it did), and so, the Oscar-winning producer went so far as to try to intimidate Farrow, using everything from spies to threats aimed at Farrow\u2019s employers at NBC News. Farrow says Weinstein told NBC he would expose the network\u2019s top star, Matt Lauer \u2014 meaning the alleged sexual misconduct that eventually unraveled the Today Show anchor\u2019s career.\n\nFor the record, NBC News denies being threatened with Lauer. Nevertheless, NBC did refuse to run Farrow\u2019s Weinstein story. Eventually, the far-left news outlet sent its own reporter and his bombshell story down the road to the New Yorker, where Farrow would not only win a Pulitzer, but launch the #MeToo movement that took down Lauer anyway.\n\nAnyway, this Hillary Clinton bombshell could not come at a worse time for the two-time presidential loser, a time when she appears to be seriously flirting with the idea of a 2020 rematch with President Trump. She might want to remember that during their 2016 battle, Trump was not afraid to remind voters that Hillary played a leading role to personally destroy the women who claimed to have been raped, abused, molested, and mistreated by her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
