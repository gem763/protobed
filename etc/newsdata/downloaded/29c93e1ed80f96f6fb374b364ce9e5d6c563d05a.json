Approximately one in 20 people suffer from colour blindness, a condition that makes the world a duller place to look at. According to the NHS, it affects 1 in 200 women in the world and 1 in 12 men. Protanopia Protanopia involves defective or absent long-wavelength cones in the retina; these photoreceptor cones are responsible for the perception of red light. Protans find it difficult to distinguish between red and green colours, and also between blue and green. Deuteranopia Deuteranopia is a condition where the green photoreceptor cone is missing from the retina. As a result, it is much harder for deutans to distinguish green from red, as well as some grays, purples and a greenish blue. Along with protanopia this is one of the most common forms of colour blindness. Tritanopia Tritanopia is a complete lack of the short-wavelength cones in the retina that receive blue light. People with this very rare form of colour blindness confuse light blues with greys, dark purples with black, mid-greens with blues and oranges with reds.\n\nTheir colour blindness is caused by an absence of medium wavelength retinal cones \u2013 these are primarily green sensitive, although the deficiency greatly affects how people perceive red as well.\n\nMeanwhile people who have Tritanopia may find they suffer from a blindness of blue and yellow colours. This can mean their vision is dominated by red or green tones.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The world of manicures and nail art may also be different for those suffering from a form of colour blindness (pictured left, a person with full vision and right, a person with Tritanopia - a form of colour blindness that affects blue and yellow colours)\n\nIt\u2019s caused by an absence of short wavelength retinal cones \u2013 these are primarily blue sensitive, although the deficiency greatly affects how people see yellow as well.\n\nWhile it may mean they're able to select a bold red or pink as a lipstick, it could also give eyeshadows and skin makeup a heavy reddish tint.\n\nThose with protanopia suffer from a blindness to red and green colours - and it appears very similar to deuteranopia.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Meanwhile those who suffer from Protanopia will see similar colours to those with Deuteranopia - although the colours will likely be duller and darker (pictured left, a person with full vision and right, a person with Deuteranopia)\n\nIt\u2019s caused by an absence of long wavelength retinal cones \u2013 these are primarily red sensitive, although the deficiency greatly affects how people see green as well.\n\nThose suffering from Protanopia find it difficult to distinguish between red and green colours, and also between blue and green.\n\nIn terms of what people with protanopia see, the results are very similar to deuteranopia but with a slight dimmer and duller effect.", "description": "To coincide with World Sight Day on Thursday, YesStyle, an Asian fashion blog, have released fascinating images to reveal how those suffering from colour blindness view makeup and beauty.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19401960-0-image-a-167_1570461091116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
