Eskom also said delays in returning units that were on planned maintenance to service contributed to supply constraints, as did diesel shortages.\n\nOn Saturday the utility said that the repair of the convener belt is progressing well.", "description": "But Eskom said the power system remains constrained, and load shedding may be implemented at short notice.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/8598df12059a44079f61fdbbdf07dc43.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
