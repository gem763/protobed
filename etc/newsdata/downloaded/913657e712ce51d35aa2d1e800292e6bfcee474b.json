I\u2019m fired up this morning! \u2014 Martina McBride (@martinamcbride) September 9, 2019\n\n\"I just have no words. My heart is pounding. I can't remember when I've been this mad,\" she posted on her story about the lack of female artists recommended.\n\n\"Is it lazy? Is it discriminatory? Is it tone deaf? Is it out of touch? @spotify what.is.it??? Please help me understand,\" she wrote.\n\nShe went on to explain why she was posting about the issue.\n\n\"I'm frustrated for my sisters,\" she wrote in her Instagram story. \"For all the great female artists who are making fabulous music. For all the female writers. And MOST OF ALL for every little girl out there who doesn't hear this music And doesn't know that SHE CAN GROW UP AND DO IT!!!\"\n\n\u201c \u201d We have an entire generation of teenage girls that have a limited example of female perspective on their radio station.\n\nOn Thursday, the country singer shared an update that she had met with Spotify and the two were working to find a solution to the problem. She believes the issue is \"industrywide\" and not particular to just the streaming platform.\n\nA study was released earlier this year by Dr. Stacy L. Smith and the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which showed that only 16% of the 500 songs on the Year-End Billboard Hot Country charts from 2014 to 2018 were from women.\n\nThe findings backed up long-standing patterns of female country artists being historically underrepresented not only on the charts but also in award shows and on the radio.\n\nMcBride also shared photos of some of the most influential women in country music, including Faith Hill, Reba McEntire, Loretta Lynn and Sheryl Crow, among others, in her explanation of why she's so passionate about pushing this cause.\n\n\"A female perspective is so important\u2026and has ALWAYS been important\u2026to the narrative of country music,\" she wrote in her post.\n\nVirginia Sherwood/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nShe shared that these strong female artists need more visibility for the sake of the younger generation.\n\n\u201c \u201d Music should be inclusive and it\u2019s up to all artists and industry gatekeepers to come to the table now and work together.\n\n\"We have an entire generation of teenage girls that have a limited example of female perspective on their radio station,\" she wrote. \"If they aren\u2019t hearing women, who is going to show them that they can also dream big dreams of being onstage and on the radio just like I did when I was a kid looking up to Reba and Patty and Loretta and Dolly and so many others? (Kathy, Suzy, Wynonna, Tanya).\"\n\nShe also explained whose responsibility it is to continue pushing for equal representation.\n\n\"Music should be inclusive and it\u2019s up to all artists and industry gatekeepers to come to the table now and work together,\" she wrote. \"It might mean someone taking a chance, taking a risk, doing a little extra. But let\u2019s keep this conversation going.\"\n\nShe also issued a challenge to her followers. \"Part of the issue is that the gatekeepers say that listeners, especially women listeners, do not want to hear women artists,\" she wrote. \"I\u2019m not making this up .. So I want your help in making a kick--- female playlist for Spotify.\"\n\nShe urged people to contribute songs in a suggestion box on her Instagram story.", "description": "Martina McBride recently noticed something while using the streaming platform, Spotify, that led her to use her voice to address female representation in country music.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/martina-mcbride-gty-jt-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
