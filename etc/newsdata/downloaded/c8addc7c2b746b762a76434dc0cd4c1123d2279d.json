Naskmariz/PhotoVoice/Frontline AIDS/PITCH\n\nThe hole disappears and reforms every year over the Antarctic due to the unique weather patterns that create incredibly cold circling winds above the pole.\n\nAccording to the British Antarctic Survey, the hole had reached an area of 11 million square kilometres in early September, when the annual \u201cspring warming\u201d event kicked in much earlier than usual.\n\nIn 2018, the hole reached a maximum area of 22.9 square kilometres.\n\nThe bizarre shift in the ozone pattern is only the second time such a change in the hole\u2019s behaviour has been observed.\n\nIn 2002, the polar vortex split in two, creating two separate ozone holes over the continent.\n\nAnna Jones a scientist at the British Antarctic Survey told The Independent the shape of the hole this year was \u201cvery unusual\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cVery occasionally in the Antarctic you will get disturbances. And I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s triggered it this year. This is a pretty new phenomenon. It could be a multiple collection of factors.\u201d\n\nSatellite records for the polar vortex in Antarctica go back to the late 1970s, but the 2002 split vortex is the only other major change.\n\n\u201cScientists haven\u2019t quite figured it out yet \u2026 there are various things they can look at, but it\u2019s certainly very unusual,\u201d Dr Jones said.\n\nExplaining how the polar vortex normally works, she said: \u201cOver Antarctica you have a very strong westerly wind system which sets up over the winter. You get very cold temperatures over the Antarctic continent and the winds are very fast, which holds it in place.\n\n\u201cThe winds are driven by the temperature difference between equatorial temperatures and polar temperatures. This is what you expect over the Antarctic. Sometimes \u2013 and it is very unusual \u2013 you get distortions to these winds.\n\n\u201cIn Antarctica you have a continent surrounded by a flat ocean. You don\u2019t have a lot of stuff at ground level, so the air can flow around without anything getting in its way.\n\n\u201cIn the Arctic, it\u2019s the opposite. You have an ocean surrounded by landmasses with mountains. Any air that flows around the Arctic will hit these landmasses and you\u2019ll get waves which propagate up into the stratosphere, so you don\u2019t get the strength of the vortex you get in the Antarctic.\u201d\n\nDescribing the shape of the 2019 hole as a \u201cblip\u201d, Dr Jones said the key to reducing the size of the ozone hole in the long term was continuing to clampdown on the illegal man-made chemicals causing the destruction. She also warned people living in South America could now be at risk from dangerous UV radiation as the ozone has thinned.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is that the gases that destroy ozone are still around, still in the atmosphere,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey destroy ozone \u2013 one of the reasons you get the hole over Antarctica is because it\u2019s so cold over Antarctica due to the very strong vortex. This causes polar stratospheric clouds, which are sort of icy surfaces and they are an important ingredient in causing the destruction of the ozone over Antarctica.\n\n\u201cIf the temperatures are warmer and you have fewer of these polar stratospheric clouds, then you will be destroying less ozone.\u201d\n\nBut a warming planet due to climate change is also bad news for the ozone layer. Higher atmospheric temperatures could also degrade the conditions required to restore the ozone layer.\n\n\u201cIf we warm the lower levels of the atmosphere, we actually cool the stratosphere,\u201d Dr Jones said. \u201cThis could extend the lifetime of the ozone hole.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis is an unusual feature resulting from unusual dynamics, but the chemistry which destroys ozone is still there.\n\n\u201cI doubt we will see this again next year. We can\u2019t be complacent, it absolutely doesn\u2019t mean the ozone hole is never going to be seen again.\u201d", "description": "The ozone hole that opens every year over the Antarctic is on course to be the smallest in three decades, scientists have said.
