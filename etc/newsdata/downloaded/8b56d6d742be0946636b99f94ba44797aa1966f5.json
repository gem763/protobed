To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. #NoToRacism.\u201d\n\nPopov, who plays for Russian club FC Rostov and has 88 caps for Bulgaria, said: \u201cIt was important that I spoke like this because it\u2019s a very big problem for everybody, for our federation, for England and if they said more bad words, even one more time, then maybe they would finish the game.\n\n\u201cWe would have such a big punishment and this is no good for Bulgarian football because if some other players want to come here, they hear what is said and how they speak bad, then this is no good for everybody.\u201d", "description": "Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov has outlined why he stayed behind to appeal to home fans to stop aiming racist chants at England players and has labelled the behaviour as \u201cembarrassing\u201d.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Paul Hayward", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213067118-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwT27dwT8Y2Pn13Ig-0qNVC8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
