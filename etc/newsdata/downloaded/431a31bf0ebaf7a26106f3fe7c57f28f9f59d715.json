They said they could expand their work to look into other issues such as data privacy.\n\nUtah attorney general Sean Reyes said the probe was \u201cfor the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field\u201d.\n\nGoogle specifically has faced accusations that its web search service leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors. There have also been complaints of potentially anti-competitive behaviour in how it runs the advertising side of its business.\n\nGoogle said in a statement on Friday that it would work constructively with them. It had no further comment on Monday. Its shares were down 0.6 per cent in late trading.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, who as Missouri attorney general opened a Google probe in 2017, lauded the announcement on Monday as \u201ca very big day for the folks who care about antitrust enforcement\u201d.\n\n\u201cI hope that Congress will get serious about acting. And I hope the United States Senate will lead the way there,\u201d he said.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cIt's going to be a very bad day for Google.\u201d\n\nFacebook, which is also under the spotlight, has faced criticism for being slow to clamp down on hate speech, and it recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy's clients included Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign.\n\nOn the federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, also for potential violations of antitrust law.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Prosecutors from almost 50 US states have launched an anti-trust investigation into Google - accusing the tech giant of unfair practices.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/31/14/chrome-update-latest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
