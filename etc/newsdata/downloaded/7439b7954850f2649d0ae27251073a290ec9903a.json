Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the lone African-American GOP senator, said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t use\u201d the term but largely supported the president\u2019s broader frustrations.\n\n\u201cThis is the political version of a death row trial. The president is up in arms in anger about it,\u201d said Scott, who met privately with Trump in 2017 after the president defended white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville. \u201cHe\u2019s putting his political life on trial. His comments reflect it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans had already been privately expressing frustration that Trump has been acting as a one-man war room in the impeachment fight, lashing out in Cabinet meetings and lobbing attacks from his Twitter account. But they were utterly unprepared for what was awaiting them on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest controversy put Republicans in an uncomfortable, albeit familiar, spot: stand with the president or distance themselves from him.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill showed little interest in jumping on Trump\u2019s latest grenade, but they also refused to slam him.\n\n\"That's not the language I would use,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) at his weekly press conference. \u201cI don't agree with that language, pretty simple.\"\n\n\u201cHe could have used different language,\u201d added House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), while making clear that he agrees with Trump\u2019s frustration over the process.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also expressed his disapproval.\n\n\"Given the history of this in our country, I would not compare it to a lynching,\" he told reporters. \"That was an unfortunate choice of words.\"\n\nOther members of GOP leadership went further.\n\n\u201cInappropriate. That\u2019s not appropriate in any context,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\nDemocrats were harsher.\n\n\u201cYou are comparing a constitutional process to the PREVALENT and SYSTEMATIC brutal torture of people in THIS COUNTRY that looked like me?\u201d tweeted Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nBut amid calls from Trump to \"get tougher and fight\" on his behalf in the impeachment fight, some Republicans are doing just that.\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the House\u2019s actions amount to a \u201clynching in every sense\u201d on Tuesday morning, throwing himself in with the president. Later in a gaggle with more than a dozen reporters, Graham called the process \u201cliterally a political lynching,\u201d questioned the state of journalism and scolded them for asking about the racial connotations of Trump\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just racial, my friend. I\u2019m from South Carolina. I understand it very well. Here\u2019s what you don\u2019t get. Mob rule is what lynching is all about. You grab somebody because you don\u2019t like them,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is what happened to Kavanaugh: You\u2019re guilty unless you can prove yourself innocent.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) acknowledged that the term carries carries \"significant historical freight\" but largely agreed with the president's complaints.\n\n\"The connotation the president is carrying forward is a political mob seeking an outcome regardless of facts. And that I think is an objectively true description of what is happening in the House right now,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStill, the GOP has grown increasingly exasperated with Trump over the past month. The president abruptly withdrew troops from the border of Syria and announced \u2014 and then reversed \u2014 plans to host the G-7 summit at his own struggling Miami resort, in what appeared to be a clear instance of profiting from the presidency.\n\nThe lynching comments were just the latest headache for the GOP. Centrist Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said in an interview that type of language \u201cis not okay.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) called on Trump to delete the tweet.\n\n\u201cWe can all disagree on the process, and argue merits. But never should we use terms like \u201clynching\u201d here,\u201d tweeted Kinzinger, who has been increasingly critical of Trump. \u201cThe painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and @realDonaldTrump should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans also acknowledge the president doesn\u2019t typically retract or apologize for his behavior, and few expect it this time.\n\nAnd even Republicans who have been critical of Trump appeared tired of having to respond to his latest controversial tweet.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), when told about the tweet, merely responded \"that's disturbing,\" while Sen Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who has spoken out vehemently against Trump in recent weeks, declined to comment further.\n\n\"You know, I think I've said enough about the President's tweets, as of late,\" Romney said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to take it down. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said one GOP lawmaker, who was disappointed with Trump\u2019s language.\n\nTrump has frequently used the phrase \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and other politically explosive language to undermine Democratic investigations and former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut the invocation of \u201clynching\u201d to characterize a process explicitly sanctioned by the Constitution marked a new, racially fraught show of malice by the president toward lawmakers\u2019 drive to remove him from office.\n\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump and @LindseyGrahamSC this is a lynching,\u201d tweeted Michael Steele, linking to a picture of an African American man being hung by noose from a tree.\n\nSteele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, continued: \u201cTrump this is not happening to you and it\u2019s pathetic that you act like you\u2019re such a victim; but it did happen to 147 black people in your state Lindsey. \u2018A lynching in every sense\u2019? You should know better.\u201d\n\nSeveral black Democratic lawmakers expressed similar indignation at Trump\u2019s analogy.\n\n\u201cYou think this impeachment is a LYNCHING? What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d tweeted Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), a civil rights activist who co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party. \u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\u201d\n\nQuint Forgey contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b1/9a/7847b5bd4ef08a577dbf000fa239/191022-lindsey-graham-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
