But this is only one side of the story. Another side of the story relates to agricultural input costs, which positively, have been relatively contained compared to this time last year.\n\nTo recap, in September 2018, South African farmers faced an average 20% year-on-year (y/y) increase in fertiliser prices and over R1 per litre increase in diesel price. This year, however, the local fertiliser prices were down by 9% y/y on average in August 2019, according to data from Grain SA. Admittedly, this does not put absolute fertiliser prices at levels prior August 2018, but it is a much welcome relief given that farmers are financially constrained after a drought season. The herbicides and insecticides prices are also down compared to levels seen in August 2018.\n\nGiven that South Africa imports about 80% of its annual fertiliser consumption and are a small player in the global market, accounting for a mere 0.5%, local prices tend to be influenced by developments in the major producing and consuming countries, such as India, Russia, the US and Canada. Last month, global fertiliser prices fell notably, partly due to a supply glut. The same is true for insecticides and herbicides the decline in global prices has been an underpinning driver of slowing domestic prices.\n\nThe only diverging input price is fuel. After some increases at the start of September, daily data from the Central Energy Fund suggest further potential mild increases of 8 cents/litre for petrol and 19 cents/litre for diesel on 02 October 2019. This is on the back of an uptick in prices, which were exacerbated by the recent attacks on a Saudi Arabian oil facility. Although this will not offset the benefits that South African farmers gained from declining fertiliser, herbicides and pesticides prices, it will add slight pressure. The impact will also extend to the agribusinesses that operate in the transport and logistics industries. On average, 75% of SA\u2019s national grain and oilseed crops are transported by road.\n\nAlso, worth noting is that global fertiliser prices tend to follow the Brent crude price trend with a few weeks delay. Therefore, if the prices of Brent crude remain relatively higher for some time because of the Saudi Arabia oil facility attack, then fertiliser prices could follow a similar trend over the coming months. We will monitor the developments closely, but communication from Saudi Arabia suggests that oil production could normalise as early as the end of September 2019.1 If this materialises, then fertiliser prices could remain at softer levels for some time, which will be beneficial for the farming community, not only in South Africa but globally.\n\nThis comes at an opportune time as the 2019/20 summer crop production season will be commencing in a few weeks\u2019 time. Much of the fertiliser imported by South Africa is utilised in maize production, which accounts for 41% of total fertiliser consumption in the country, the second-largest consumer being sugar cane at 18%. Fertiliser constitutes about 35% of grain farmers\u2019 input costs and a notable share in other agricultural commodities and crops.\n\nOn balance, the 2019/20 summer crop production season is starting on better footing than the previous one. The expected better weather conditions2 and the aforementioned price movements of key agricultural inputs will help ease pressure on farmers financials following a difficult season that saw a double-digit decline in production of summer grains and oilseeds.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s food price inflation accelerates\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s food price inflation accelerated to 3.8% y/y in August 2019, from 3.0% y/y in the previous month. While food product prices were mixed within the basket, the uptick in headline food price inflation was primarily underpinned by meat, bread and cereal product prices. The increase in prices of these products reflected the dynamics at farm level.\n\nFirst, since the start of the year, maize prices have largely traded at higher levels compared to 2018 because of the anticipated poor harvest on the back of drier weather conditions in the central and western parts of South Africa. The production data corroborates this point, with 2018/19 maize, soybeans and sunflower seed production down by 12% y/y, 21% y/y and 24% y/y, to 11.02 million tonnes, 1.17 million tonnes and 680 940 tonnes, respectively.\n\nSecond, the increases in meat prices comprise pork, beef and other meats. In the case of pork, the increases are in line with the developments in the global pork market where prices have been supported by increasing demand in Asia. The Asian demand comes after the region\u2019s pig industry, specifically in China and Vietnam, declined notably because of the spread of African swine fever. Domestic beef prices have also recovered following a period of suppressed prices when there was a ban on South African exports because of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at the start of 2019. South African beef exports have since resumed, and with that came an uptick in demand which supported prices.\n\nThese price dynamics of meat, bread and cereals were driving the headline food price inflation number, amongst other products, in August 2019. We generally expect food price inflation to remain slightly elevated over the next few months in line with an increase in farm-level prices, which are illustrated by the data in Figure 1 below.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Wandile Sihlobo covering: Brent Oil Futures.
