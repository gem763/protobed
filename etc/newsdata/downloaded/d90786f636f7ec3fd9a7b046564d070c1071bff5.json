(AP) - Pat Fitzgerald is one of Jonathan Taylor\u2019s biggest fans.\n\nIn fact, Northwestern\u2019s coach said he feels Wisconsin\u2019s All-American running back is the best player in the country.\n\n\u201cIf I had a Heisman vote right now, he\u2019s getting my vote,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing outstanding, absolutely outstanding, football. \u2026 JT\u2019s been a great player since the minute he walked into this league, and he\u2019s playing at as high of a level as any running back that I\u2019ve seen in my time here.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald and the Wildcats (1-2, 0-1 Big Ten) will look to slow down the 2018 Doak Walker Award winner when they face the eighth-ranked Badgers (3-0, 1-0) on Saturday.\n\nTaylor was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts against Michigan last week. Taylor scored twice and became the first Wisconsin player in history to rush for at least 200 yards (203) against the Wolverines.\n\nTaylor has rushed for at least 100 yards in 25 of his 30 career games. None of those 25 games were against the Wildcats, who are coming off a loss to Michigan State.\n\nTaylor has faced Northwestern twice in his career and has been held to a total of 126 yards on 30 carries, just 4.2 yards per carry and 63 per game. He had just 46 yards on 11 carries and two fumbles in a 31-17 loss on the road to the Wildcats last season.\n\n\u201cThose guys play well off blocks,\u201d Taylor said of the Northwestern defenders. \u201cThey fill gaps really well and they play with length.\u201d\n\nTOP-RANKED DEFENSE\n\nWisconsin gave up its first touchdown of the year last week to Michigan after beginning the season with over 160 straight scoreless minutes. The Badgers\u2019 defense is giving up an average of just 27 yards rushing per game, which leads the nation. Wisconsin also ranks No. 1 nationally in scoring defense (4.7 points per game), total defense (171.3 yards per game) and pass efficiency defense (75.7).\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re playing outstanding, absolute lights out,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cYou tip your hat to them. They\u2019re playing physical. They\u2019re fitting everything right. Their secondary is outstanding, absolutely outstanding, so we\u2019ve got our hands full.\u201d\n\nFAMILIAR TERRITORY\n\nThe Wildcats are staring at a potential 1-3 record for the second straight season. A year ago, Northwestern went on a run to the Big Ten West title, its first trip to the conference championship game and a victory in the Holiday Bowl. But starting slow is a trend they would like to end.\n\nThe Wildcats also got off to a 2-3 start in 2017, only to finish with a 10-3 record, and lost three of its first four in 2016.\n\nA WHOLE NEW COAN\n\nNorthwestern dominated Wisconsin\u2019s Jack Coan last season in what was his first career start. But the junior quarterback has won five consecutive starts and is second in the Big Ten in pass efficiency (176.8) this season. Coan and Taylor have combined for 145 points in their first three games, more than three times what Northwestern has scored as a team in the same amount of minutes.\n\nSHAKY START\n\nQuarterback Hunter Johnson came to Northwestern with plenty of hype after transferring from Clemson. But he\u2019s off to a shaky start. Johnson struggled in a season-opening loss at Stanford. He rebounded in a win over UNLV, only to get pulled in the fourth quarter last week in favor of Aidan Smith after going 15 of 26 for 88 yards and an interception.\n\nHe then had a rather one-sided conversation with his coach after he got pulled.\n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t give him a chance to have a response,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cI went up directly to him in the locker room and said the decision to put Aidan in was mine. We needed a spark, we had sputtered through the third quarter. \u2026 I\u2019m not just going to sit idle. We have to execute. And if we don\u2019t execute, we have to have competition. Hunter knows he\u2019s got to be better. He\u2019s the first guy to admit it.\u201d\n\nJohnson is just 33 of 68 for 308 yards and has more interceptions (four) than touchdowns (one).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep preparing every day, prepare my butt off to be ready for every game,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing really changes. I\u2019ve got to clean some things up, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nEVEN STEVEN\n\nThe teams have split their last 28 meetings, 14-14.\n\n\u201cWhen you play this team, in general, you\u2019re going to have to earn everything that you get,\u201d Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst said. \u201cThey\u2019re tough, they\u2019re physical; you\u2019ve got to work for it and you\u2019ve got to earn it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pat Fitzgerald is one of Jonathan Taylor's biggest fans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/michigan_wisconsin_football_75165_c0-176-4201-2625_s1770x1032.jpg?1c1820c1d235c68c6604e8971b7dcd67fab72f0a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
