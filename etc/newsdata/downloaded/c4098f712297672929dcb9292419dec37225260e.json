However, Hardy was booked against Jarjis Danho at UFC Singapore. He was moved to Friday\u2019s event in Boston when Danho fell off that card.\n\nHardy (5-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) will face a UFC debutant in Ben Sosoli (7-2 MMA, 0-0 UFC) on the main card, which airs on ESPN 2.\n\nHaving his hopes of a top-ranked opponent replaced by a relative unknown wasn\u2019t easy for Hardy, but he\u2019s over it and focused on the task at hand.\n\n\u201cBe humble,\u201d Hardy told MMA Junkie. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t get what you want. To throw a tantrum would be out of character. I just decided to listen to my coaches who got me here. (I) just heard the words of my agents and take the ring time.\u201d\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t put up much of an argument with his coaches, Hardy started to envision the headlines beating another unproven UFC heavyweight will generate.\n\n\u201cHere we go again,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cSo he\u2019s going to be a can as soon as I\u2019m done. Man, they\u2019re going to be mad at me again. You\u2019ve got to go through this process, but why?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just think about it. Before I pick up the phone and get crazy, let\u2019s think about why. This is what got you here. This is the process: always readjusting, reassessing.\u201d\n\nA model citizen since signing with the UFC, Hardy\u2019s past run-ins with the law are still a main talking point when it comes to the former NFL defensive end.\n\nHardy indicated he thinks the court of public opinion has been inconsistent with rulings. To those who call for his banishment from the UFC, Hardy said he\u2019ll be happy to leave if the promotion implements a consistent rule across the board.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to implement a rule that anybody who\u2019s had trouble with the law can\u2019t fight, I\u2019m down. I\u2019ll quit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to implement a rule that anybody that\u2019s been in trouble can\u2019t fight, I\u2019ll quit. It\u2019s not the reality of things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re human \u2013 100 percent of us are flawed. I\u2019ll approach this like any situation in life. I\u2019ve got to keep moving forward for the peers and people who are supporting me. There are too many people in this world who want to see me win, but I might get knocked out. You\u2019ve got to buy a ticket to find out either way.\u201d\n\nSince making the jump to MMA from the NFL, Hardy\u2019s mantra has been \u201cfinding peace in the violence.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hardy, this mindset was absent from his football career. Coming over to MMA, Hardy was humbled. Being around some of the toughest fighters in the world made Hardy reassess.\n\n\u201cIn football, I had it \u2013 but in a different way,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t peace in violence. It was I was home, and destruction. I was a darker soul. I was the kraken. I was the devil\u2019s pet. It consumed me in a different way, coming to MMA and having to temper myself.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I had to adjust my perspective to survive. I had to adjust my perspective to continue to gain. I found peace in the violence. I found something I never found in football: the ability to weather the storm and continue on my own path. I\u2019m righteous because I support my team and family. It\u2019s about what I\u2019m in and my journey and accepting people and their opinions about my journey.\u201d", "description": "While he hoped for a step up in competition at UFC on ESPN 6, Greg Hardy is here for the ride.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "John Morgan", "Dan Tom", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/greg-hardy-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
