And they\u2019d used the Steele dossier, opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign, as evidence.\n\nBut Nunes and his committee couldn\u2019t say anything, not to the U.S. public, not even to fellow members of Congress. The FBI and DOJ had buried the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant, like so much of the anti-Trump operation, under the heading of classified intelligence.\n\nIt marked a low point for Nunes\u2019 team. Shortly after, former DOJ prosecutor Kashyap Patel joined them. At first Patel\u2019s new colleagues didn\u2019t know what to make of him. As a New Yorker, Patel\u2019s style sometimes clashed with those of the easygoing Californians, southerners, and midwesterners who made up the HPSCI staff.\n\nNunes told his team he trusted Patel. \u201cI wanted Kash to lead, and I wanted them to follow his lead,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cI hired him to bust doors down and didn\u2019t want them to get in his way.\u201d\n\nPatel likes to mix it up in the corners. He\u2019s a lifelong hockey fanatic. He coaches youth hockey in the Washington, DC, area and skates defense for the nationally renowned Dons, an amateur team named after the hockey commentator and fashion legend Don Cherry.\n\nPatel grew up on Long Island cheering for his local franchise, the New York Islanders, and was born in Queens, like the forty-fifth president. He says he knew Trump was going to win the moment he came down the escalator. \u201cOne, he\u2019s from New York and doesn\u2019t like to lose. He plans everything. Two, no one dominates the media like that guy. So everyone calls me crazy for eighteen months, but I was right.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in one of the few remaining Washington, DC, bars where smoking cigars is permitted. Patel hands me a Gurkha, made by a friend in Miami, Kaizad Hansotia, and lights it. He says he was expecting that there would be irregularities with the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. He knew the figures involved, FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, FBI agent Peter Strzok, and his mistress FBI lawyer Lisa Page. \u201cThey\u2019re really good agents and really good lawyers,\u201d Patel says.\n\nThe problem, he says, was that there was no accountability in significant parts of Obama\u2019s Justice Department, often even when dealing with high-profile cases. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to the way the upper echelons worked. It was out of the ordinary, Patel thought, that FBI director James Comey had never investigated the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers after the alleged Russian hack of DNC emails.\n\n\u201cInstead, Comey just accepted CrowdStrike\u2019s assessment,\u201d says Patel. \u201cSome random outside company that happened to be retained by Perkins Coie, the Clinton campaign\u2019s lawyers. I never worked a case involving cyber where the FBI said, \u2018Let\u2019s not use our own people on this one.\u2019 You\u2019re supposed to do it yourself, you\u2019re the FBI.\u201d\n\nFor Patel, Comey\u2019s exoneration of Clinton was a stark illustration of everything that was wrong at DOJ. \u201cHe hijacked the Clinton investigation,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was not his call to make. You don\u2019t go on TV and say, \u2018I, the FBI director, am deciding what is a prosecutor\u2019s decision.\u2019 And by the way, all my colleagues in the national security division, all truly apolitical, every one of us would have taken the Clinton case to a grand jury.\u201d\n\nPatel had had enough. \u201cI was at the doctor\u2019s that day, and he asked why my blood pressure was running so high. I told him it was Comey\u2019s speech. All that just added up over time, and I was thinking \u2018I got to get out of here.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Patel accepted the job with Nunes\u2019s team, he didn\u2019t know much about Congress or the Intelligence Committee. \u201cBut I was prepared to know who I would be dealing with in DOJ when I came on. I told Devin that we will find that the people running the Russia investigation will have done inappropriate things. Maybe from an outsider\u2019s view looking in, I might have also called myself crazy for saying that. Because it\u2019s supposed to be DOJ.\u201d\n\nPatel explains that as a public defender he learned that documents are the key to taking on DOJ. \u201cYou have much fewer resources as a public defender. Witness testimony is great but if we can get the government\u2019s own evidence to show X, Y, and Z, then you\u2019ve got them.\u201d\n\nHe collected all the investigative documents surrounding Crossfire Hurricane. \u201cI knew I had to get the documents leading to the production of the FISA,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to know what the government knew, when they knew it, and if there were any material omissions in the FISA application.\u201d\n\nOnce they secured the documents from the FBI, Patel and the Intelligence Committee moved to interviews to get people on the record. Did anyone have proof that the Trump team had colluded with Russia?\n\n\u201cI had to tell a lot of people that collusion isn\u2019t a crime,\u201d says Patel. \u201cIt sounds bad, but it doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s a legal fiction. But I was like, okay, we\u2019ve got to use that because it\u2019s in the media and everybody\u2019s already using it.\u201d\n\nThe important thing was to determine if there had been any criminal activity. Patel, along with HPSCI staff came up with the \u201cthree Cs\u201d: collude, conspire, coordinate.\n\n\u201cConspiracy is a real crime,\u201d says a colleague of Patel\u2019s who asked his name not be used. \u201cCoordination isn\u2019t a crime, but it was a way to explain in layman\u2019s terms a predicate for conspiracy. So did anyone see any coordination between the Trump team and Russia?\u201d\n\nNunes\u2019s committee interviewed officials from the Obama administration, the law enforcement and intelligence communities, and the Trump campaign. It was the same line of questioning for all of them.\n\n\u201cWe asked them the three Cs straight up,\u201d says Patel.\n\nHe runs down a partial list:\n\n\u201c\u2018Do you, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, have evidence of the three Cs?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Do you, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Do you, Jim Comey?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Do you, Andy McCabe?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Do you, John Podesta?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Do you, Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\nA number of witnesses tried to sidestep Patel\u2019s line of questioning.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Hang on. I\u2019m not asking if you thought it happened or if you heard it happened,\u2019\u201d Patel says. \u201cI said, \u2018Do you have information that exactly addresses this issue? If you tell me it exists, we\u2019ll go get the documents, we\u2019ll go get the people, we\u2019ll use subpoenas.\u2019 We weren\u2019t hired to clear Donald Trump. We were charged with figuring out what happened.\u201d\n\nThe investigation, he says, was going to reveal whether there was collusion or not. \u201cIt\u2019s a finite question. We weren\u2019t trying to solve an unsolvable murder. Donald Trump got elected. We knew the Russians definitely did some squirrely stuff, hacked some things and whatnot. The issue was, was there evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign said anything to the Russians like \u2018Trump wants to be president, you help him, he\u2019ll help you down the road\u2019? We asked every single person we interviewed, and not a single person answered affirmatively to that question.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing.\n\n\u201cSo if no one had any evidence,\u201d says Patel, \u201cincluding the principals that were running the investigation, then maybe it didn\u2019t happen. It became evident that the answer was no across the board. I didn\u2019t expect to find that clean of an answer. But we did.\u201d\n\nIf there was no evidence of collusion, conspiracy, or coordination, what had happened? The FBI had opened an investigation on the Trump campaign and had obtained a surveillance warrant without any real evidence. Something was very wrong.\n\n\u201cI said from the beginning that Jim Comey and Andy McCabe are not squared away guys,\u201d says Patel. \u201cI knew that something was up.\u201d\n\nPatel had worked with Comey and the others. \u201cYou cannot put on paper the value of sitting in a room with people,\u201d he says. \u201cMy job has always been to read people. I was a trial lawyer. I had to read juries. I was pretty good at being able to read people and find their biases. I said the same thing when I was running this investigation: \u2018I know these guys, I know their biases. I\u2019ve been in a room with them. They present well. But they have agendas. And they tailor their investigations to reflect those agendas, at least the high-profile ones.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe fundamental problem with the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was the Crossfire Hurricane group. Now it was time for the Nunes team to pivot; they were going to investigate the investigators.\n\n\u201cI told Devin that our investigation is going to be a thing,\u201d says Patel. \u201cI told him we needed a name. It\u2019s going to be big. There are so many parts to this. There were so many snakes on one head. I told Devin, \u2018We need to cut off the head, like Medusa.\u2019 So that\u2019s what I called it: \u2018Objective Medusa.\u2019 It was our thing.\u201d\n\nThe Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History will be released October 29.", "description": "If there was no evidence of collusion, conspiracy, or coordination, what had happened?
