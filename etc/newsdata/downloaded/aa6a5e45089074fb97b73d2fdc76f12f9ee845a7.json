Here\u2019s why it matters.", "language": "en", "text": "Monta\u00f1o, now pregnant with her third child, recently announced her partnership with Cadenshae, a New Zealand brand creating activewear for nursing mothers. Whereas traditional athlete contracts are tied to performance, Monta\u00f1o is under no pressure to return to the track within a specific time frame, according to a release from the company.\n\nGranted, most parents don\u2019t earn their living through sponsorships. But many share Monta\u00f1o\u2019s desire for a professional role that allows them to thrive both at work and at home. Finding a family-friendly employer can be hard, but Monta\u00f1o\u2019s recent move gives parents hope that it\u2019s possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOfficial policies to support families\n\nA great starting point for finding out whether a potential employer is family-friendly is to review their policies.\n\nAccording to Vicki Shabo, senior fellow for Paid Leave Policy and Strategy at New America, these policies recognize that employees need flexibility. Family-friendly employers offer paid sick time without penalty, whether you are sick or you\u2019re taking time off to care for a family member, she said. They also offer, whenever possible, predictable schedules, employee schedule control, the option to work remotely and a backup staffing plan in case you need time off to provide emergency child or elder care.\n\nAD\n\nShabo also said that while dedicated paid family and medical leave are important, they are \u201ctoo rare.\u201d Monta\u00f1o called attention to the absence of maternity protections in her Nike contract in a video and an op-ed that appeared in the New York Times in May. Monta\u00f1o said in a phone interview last week that it\u2019s not just the sports world where women need more support.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA common denominator for a lot of women in [any] industry is that we continue to face barriers that are trying to keep us from progressing [even though] they\u2019re very, very natural things that we are going through,\u201d she said.\n\nAlysia Monta\u00f1o called out Nike for not supporting parents. Many Americans can relate.\n\nA 2019 report on federal employees published by the National Partnership for Women and Families said that increased satisfaction with family-friendly policies decreased turnover intention. It also said federal employees with access to family-friendly policies report increased satisfaction managing work and family responsibilities and higher job satisfaction.\n\nAD\n\nA lack of family-friendly policies led Michael Pirone, a CPA/accountant from Glen Rock, N.J., to leave the public accounting position he\u2019d been in for nearly a decade. Because his employer offered no leave for fathers, he took only two days off when his son was born. But it was the lack of flexibility around tax season, which demanded 70- to 80-hour workweeks, that ultimately drove him to find a new employer. \u201cI realized that during these four months, I was essentially nonexistent at home, and most of my time was spent in the office,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nUnofficial policies matter too\n\nPolicies and contracts, however, cannot create a family-friendly environment if the workplace culture doesn\u2019t support it. For employees to feel comfortable utilizing the available policies, \u201cManagement needs to provide supervisors the tools to embrace these policies,\u201d Shabo said.\n\nAD\n\nAt Pirone\u2019s new employer, the culture is in fact critical. It\u2019s a small office, and there are no specific policies in place, but he says the new job is \u201ca unicorn.\u201d His employer allows ample time off and flexibility to pick his son up from day care or take him to the doctor. \u201cThey are very flexible and understanding of anything family related,\u201d he said.\n\nRandi Braun knows how stressful it is when official policy and workplace culture are mismatched, and how satisfying it is when they align. The Washington, D.C., mom of two says her previous sales position was family-friendly, but only on paper: \u201cI was allowed to do things like work from home and come and go on a flex schedule,\u201d she said. But there was a perception that only the moms left early and worked remotely. \u201cThey were \u2018mommy-tracked.\u2019\u201d Braun said. \u201cIt was this very quiet and unspoken politics.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBraun and some of her colleagues, who were also moms, stealthily covered for one another during bouts of morning sickness or emergency pediatrician visits. \u201cAfter two years that really wore me down,\u201d Braun said. When she was pregnant with her second child, she walked away from a big promotion to take a sales position at another company.\n\nAD\n\nBraun\u2019s new employer is truly family-friendly. They offer more parental leave, she said, but \u201cit\u2019s the unofficial policies that have been the biggest game-changer.\u201d She now has the flexibility to take a sick day for her kids or arrive late after taking them to the doctor, without judgment. Family-oriented programming also contributes to that culture. Braun\u2019s employer offers a work-sponsored pumpkin carving night and a Working Parents Resource Group.\n\nCaitlin Wolf is a public relations agent who left a fast-paced firm and a one-hour commute for a 100 percent work-from-home position. The Stevensville, Md., mother of two loves that her remote position allows her to spend more time with her kids. She\u2019s also grateful for the supportive community she and her colleagues have created through monthly family events her employer organizes, such as a pool day and a group outing to a Ravens game.\n\nAD\n\nUnderstanding workplace culture as an outsider can be challenging but it\u2019s not impossible. Here are expert suggestions on how parents can find a position at a family-friendly company.\n\nAD\n\nFind out who the policies are for. A truly family-friendly workplace will support all genders. \u201cIt\u2019s important for employers to adopt gender-neutral policies that honor workers\u2019 commitments to their families,\u201d Shabo said. \u201cCreating policies that only apply to women are legally risky and only serve to reinforce stereotypes that hold women back.\u201d\n\nBraun, who uses what she learned from her own experience in her women\u2019s career coaching business, encourages clients to ask whether there are people on flexible schedules who aren\u2019t parents. If that\u2019s the case, she explained, \u201cThere\u2019s less stigma there, of \u2018all the moms leave early.' \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsk questions in person. Shabo acknowledges that for many job seekers, asking policy questions \u201cwill be uncomfortable and risky.\u201d While Cadenshae approached Monta\u00f1o because they appreciated her role as an advocate, most women, even if they\u2019re being recruited, are negotiating job offers under different circumstances.\n\nAD\n\nShabo says potential employees can keep their questions regarding the culture, policies and norms more general while being careful to \u201clisten and watch for the reactions of the person who is interviewing them.\u201d\n\nBraun also emphasizes the importance of asking these types of questions in person. In particular, Braun advises pregnant women who aren\u2019t yet showing to wait until after they receive an offer to talk about maternity leave and to make sure that conversation is not conducted over email. \u201cYou want to hear the reaction that somebody has,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to see the reaction that somebody has. That will tell you a lot.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTalk to potential co-workers. Once they have an offer, Braun advises her clients to ask questions like, \u201cCan I talk to another working parent on your team?\" \u201cCan I talk to a peer?\u201d \"Can I talk to somebody else?\u201d Those informal conversations play a big part in getting a genuine feel for the culture.\n\nAD\n\nCheck their references. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat a word-of-mouth reference,\u201d Braun said. Amber Nash, a Kansas City senior financial analyst, applied for a new position when she was 41 weeks pregnant and her employer was cutting back on remote work. Having heard through colleagues that the new company was family-friendly, she took the job. She said not only can she draw on a generous leave policy, she\u2019s \u201cencouraged to do so.\u201d\n\nWhen your personal network comes up short, the Internet is a valuable resource. Braun recommends websites such as Glassdoor, List Your Leave and Fairygodboss, where people can anonymously post information about their experiences with a company.\n\nAD\n\nPam Moore is a freelance writer, group fitness instructor and mom based in Boulder, Colo.
