MPs have backed the motion by 299 votes to 70 - leaving Boris Johnson 135 votes short of the votes he needed for this division to have force. Reading out the result, John Bercow says this technically means \u201cthe noes have it\u201d.\n\nThis failed because Johnson needs 2/3 support, including abstentions, because of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.\n\nHowever, a one-line bill to change the FTPA only requires a 50% + 1 majority.\n\nJo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has just finished speaking now. She said that she wanted a second referendum but did not believe there was a majority for it in the Commons. That is why she wanted an early election, she said. She argued that this provided the best chance of stopping Brexit. Corbyn appeared to rule out accepting an early election on Thursday 12 December, the government\u2019s preferred date. He suggested this would lead to students being disenfranchised. But he suggested that Labour could back on early election taking place on Monday 9 December (the date proposed by the Lib Dems and the SNP). But the date would have to be set in law, he said (something that would happen if MPs passed an amendment to the Fixed-term Parliament\u2019s Act for an early election, but not if MPs used a FTPA super-majority vote to trigger one - because that mechanism would allow the PM to decide the election date.)\n\nKey Point\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal will not be brought back to this parliament. No 10 pledged to drop it in a bid to convince the SNP and the Lib Dems to support the push for a general election before Christmas.\n\nGet Brexit Done\n\nThis setup is a huge advantage for Johnson.\n\nHe can campaign on a \"Get Brexit Done\" platform while the Liberal Democrats and Labour split the Remain vote.\n\nSo why would SNP and the Liberal Democrats go along?\n\nAs I pointed out previously, it was to Labour's advantage to have Brexit settled before an election. Yesterday, the Liberal Democrats and SNP finally came to that conclusion.\n\nUnderstanding What's Happening\n\nJohnson is so far ahead in the polls that he would rather gamble on elections before the Withdrawal Agreement is settled. The Liberal Democrats desperately need elections to pick up seats from Labour. That is their second agenda. Their first agenda, outright staying in the EU, is dead. The Liberal Democrats \"Remain\" strategy blows up the moment the Withdrawal Agreement is approved. A Johnson win would strengthen the case for another Scottish Referendum\n\nSNP Will Support Dec 12 IF\n\nThe SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the Commons his party would support the prime minister\u2019s new plan for a 12 December election if he gave a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d he would not bring back the withdrawal agreement bill. It is clear that there is a desire on the opposition benches to bring forward a bill that can give us an election. But we don\u2019t trust this prime minister and we don\u2019t trust this prime minister for good reason. So, the prime minister, if he is going to bring forward a bill, must give an absolute cast-iron assurance that, up until the passage of that bill and the rising of parliament, that there will be no attempt to bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill.\n\nJanuary 31 is Now Moot\n\nDoes Ian mean now, later, or always?\n\nIf Ian means before an election, Johnson should accept.\n\nRegardless, any election date in December is to Johnson's advantage.\n\nThe January 31 extension is moot if there are elections in December, as now seems likely.\n\nMoreover, \"No Deal\" is back in play as discussed in January Brexit Extension Increases Chance of No Deal.", "description": "Johnson agreed to a January 31 extension and lost a .10/29/2019 19:56:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/275/2418afd6-d271-4dba-b893-6a279914a3fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
