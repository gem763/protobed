Among the songs West has been performing is \"Closed on Sunday,\" which heavily references Chick-fil-A.\n\n\"Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A,\" the song begins, according to recordings and reporting by people in the audience at listening parties. The phrase repeats again and again as the hook of the song.\n\nThe song goes on to preach against Instagram (\"Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away\") and the importance of faith (\"Follow Jesus, listen and obey\").\n\nChick-fil-A declined to comment on the song. But, the fast-food shout-out seems fitting for the gospel-influenced album. Every location of the fast-food chain is closed on Sunday.\n\n\"Closing our business on Sunday, the Lord's Day, is our way of honoring God and showing our loyalty to Him,\" Chick-fil-A's founder, Truett Cathy, wrote in his book \"Eat Mor Chikin: Inspire More People.\"\n\nIn 2000, Cathy's children \u2014 including Dan Cathy, now the chain's CEO \u2014 pledged to uphold the company's commitment to closing on Sundays and to never take it public.\n\nRead more: Chick-fil-A likely loses out on more than $1 billion in sales every year by closing on Sundays \u2014 and it's a brilliant business strategy\n\nLike West, who has faced backlash for his support of President Donald Trump and numerous provocative statements, Chick-fil-A is no stranger to controversy. In 2012, the company faced boycott threats due to its significant donations to groups opposing same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A has cut donations to controversial groups, with the exceptions of the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, but it has continued to face criticism from certain progressive groups for its charitable giving.\n\nWest's love of fast food more generally is well documented. The rapper has a special appreciation for McDonald's, tweeting in 2018, \"McDonald's is my favorite restaurant.\" The declaration followed a 2016 tweet from West that said, \"McDonald's is my favorite brand.\"\n\nA representative for West did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Chick-fil-A's polarizing reputation and whether McDonald's was still the rapper's favorite restaurant.\n\nWest has also made financial investments into the fast-food industry.\n\nIn 2008, West bought the rights to open 10 Fatburger locations in Chicago. And, when West married Kim Kardashian in 2014, he reportedly bought her the rights to open 10 Burger King franchises located throughout Europe \u2014 though no locations were ultimately opened in the Kardashian-West name.", "description": "Kanye West references Chick-fil-A in his new song \"Closed on Sunday,\" according to people attending listening parties.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9357ff2e22af5c7b769162?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
