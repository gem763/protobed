The growing demand for gold as a conductive metal used in phones and other electronic products has helped spawn a deadly illegal trade that\u2019s harder to track than other black-market commodities like blood diamonds or drugs.\n\n\u201cThe Weekly\u201d travels to Colombia, where violent paramilitary groups have infiltrated every level of the supply chain, extorting prospectors, gold traders and some of the country\u2019s top mining officials.
