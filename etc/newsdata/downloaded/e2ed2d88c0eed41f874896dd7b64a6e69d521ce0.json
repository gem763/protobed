Commissioner Kenneth Hayne recommended a total ban on the hawking of insurance and superannuation products.\n\n\"There is no real check on what is said to the target [of hawkers] and often the target is not able to check the truth of what is said,\" Commissioner Hayne wrote in his final report.\n\n\"The asymmetry of power and information between the provider of the product and service and the acquirer is very large. Even if the \u2018hawker\u2019 is not fraudulent or unscrupulous (and, too often, cases examined in evidence showed that the hawker was at least unscrupulous) the acquirer is nevertheless \u2018unsuspecting\u2019.\"\n\nWhile hawking is normally associated with telesales, Commissioner Hayne included face-to-face meetings in his proposed ban on hawking, saying: \"For the avoidance of doubt, it should also be made plain that a solicited meeting, or telephone call, to discuss one type of financial product must not be used for the unsolicited offering of some other type of product.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterpreted in this way, the ban would have major implications for the cross-selling of products by vertically integrated organisations that sell banking, insurance and superannuation products. Commissioner Hayne explicitly stated that these should be regarded as separate products.\n\n\"Common forms of banking products, like transaction accounts and credit card accounts should be treated as together forming the one kind of product. But each superannuation product and each insurance product is, and should be treated as, a distinct product type,\" he wrote in his final report.\n\nThe government has committed to implementing the proposed hawking bans by June 30, 2020.\n\nASIC pre-empted this recommendation in July when it proposed a total ban on direct telephone sales of life insurance and consumer credit insurance.\n\n\"Such a ban is consistent with the financial services royal commission recommendations and will provide consumers with further protections from misselling practices now, ahead of wider law reform by government. Without such a ban, we are concerned that consumers will continue to be preyed upon by peddlers of inappropriate insurance products, using pressure sales tactics,\" ASIC commissioner Sean Hughes said.\n\nThe ban, which would be achieved through a modification to the Corporations Act, is subject to a consultation period and would not come into effect until March 2020.\n\nCBA has agreed to sell CommInsure to Hong Kong-based life insurer AIA for $2.375 billion, in a deal that was first announced in 2017 but is yet to go through. The sale is expected to be completed in the second half of the 2020 financial year.", "description": "Commonwealth Bank of Australia's life insurance arm CommInsure has been charged with 87 counts of hawking life insurance products.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1833%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9963c86091cbea3e265723133b391d3fe3469ff6", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
