You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe complaint emerged following an incident at a restaurant in the Lords, where Lord Stone shouted that his guest \"wanted the trans operation\" at a stall where staff were asking for signatures to a pledge against homophobic and transphobic behaviour.\n\nThe peer insisted he was not transphobic and told the commissioner that those who were offended were \u201cnot as enlightened as I am about the equality of gay, lesbian, trans or whatever else\".\n\nIn defending his sense of equality, Lord Stone said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call somebody a \u2018n****\u2019 in, like, in an aggressive way, but let us say I was at some meeting, which I often am, particularly in Israel with black people or whatever, I would say, \u2018We are all n******, I am\u2019\u2014 what do you call it\u2014\u2018an honorary n*****\u2019, yes, and they would say, \u2018Yes, Andrew is just as n***** as we are\u2019.\"\n\nOn another occasion, the peer stopped a woman in a stairwell while they were alone and complimented her on hair. When she showed concern at his comments, he grabbed her arm and told her \"while it might be thought sexist to say so, she really did look beautiful\".\n\nLord Stone defended his behaviour as an attempt to boost the complainant's self esteem.\n\nAnother woman complained that he signed off emails with kisses and stroked her arm for \"five to ten seconds\" to thank her for completing a task, which left her feeling \"really angry, uncomfortable, anxious and pinned in\".\n\nThe staffer said his behaviour towards female colleagues was \u201ca bit creepy\u201d, describing a previous joke he made to a young woman in which he said he hoped the \u2018Upskirting\u2019 Bill would contain photos.\n\nThe peer said he did not recall the stroking incident but he believed his behaviour was \"benign, as it was an expression and recognition of the inter-relatedness of all humanity\".\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
