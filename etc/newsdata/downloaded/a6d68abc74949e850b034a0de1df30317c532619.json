Meatballs typically require chilling time so they\u2019ll hold their shape, but we\u2019re keeping it low-key and casual here. Translation: As you turn them in the pan to brown them on all sides, the dish will not suffer if your spheres morph into lesser shapes.\n\n[Stock your kitchen with the Dinner in Minutes Pantry for stress-free weeknight meals]\n\nChickpeas, concentrated tomato essence and sauteed onion bolster the easy sauce; those ingredients account for the original recipe\u2019s \u201cAlgerian-style\u201d reference. (The minutes of simmering once the meatballs are returned to the pan will give you enough time to have that glass of something mentioned above!)\n\nToasted almonds with tons of curly parsley add a little crunch to each bite. I\u2019ve eaten this dish on its own, stuffed into warm pitas and atop couscous, with equal delight.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 medium yellow onion\n\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n6 cloves garlic (some large and small)\n\n1 pound ground turkey, preferably dark meat\n\n1 large egg\n\n2 teaspoons ground cumin\n\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\n2 teaspoons sweet paprika\n\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n\nOne 14 1/2-ounce can low-sodium chickpeas, drained\n\nWater\n\n1 bunch curly parsley, rinsed and dried\n\nGenerous handful of sliced almonds\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nCut the onion into small dice, to yield about 1 cup.\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and cook until softened and lightly colored, about 10 minutes.\n\nStep 2\n\nMeanwhile, mince the garlic and place half of it in a mixing bowl. Add the ground turkey, egg, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, the 1/2 teaspoon salt and a generous pinch of the black pepper. Dampen your hands with water, then use them to gently mix until just blended. Shape the mixture into 24 meatballs of equal size; they will be soft, so don\u2019t worry too much about perfectly round shapes.\n\nStep 3\n\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer the sauteed onion to a plate; leaving some oil in the pan. Increase the heat to medium-high; add half the meatballs and cook until they have browned all over, about 5 minutes; they will not be cooked through.\n\nTransfer to the plate with the onion and repeat with the remaining meatballs (you won\u2019t need to add more oil for the second batch), also transferring them to the plate.\n\nStep 4\n\nReduce the heat to medium. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of oil; once it\u2019s warmed through, add the remaining minced garlic, the remaining teaspoon of ground cumin and the paprika. Cook for 1 minute, then stir in the tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds.\n\nReturn all the meatballs and sauteed onion to the pan, then add the chickpeas and enough water to barely cover the meatballs. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the meatballs are tender and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep the meatballs evenly moist.\n\nStep 5\n\nMeanwhile, coarsely chop the parsley. Toast the almonds in a small, dry skillet over medium-low heat, until fragrant and lightly browned. Let cool.\n\nUse the slotted spoon to transfer the meatballs to a serving dish; if a few chickpeas come along, that\u2019s okay. Increase the heat to medium-high to cook the sauce until slightly thickened, an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Feel free to mash some chickpeas to further thicken the sauce, if you wish. Or add a bit more water if the sauce is too thick.\n\nStep 6\n\nTaste, and season with more salt, as needed. Pour the sauce and chickpeas over the meatballs. Scatter the parsley and almonds on top. Serve hot.\n\nAdapted from \u201cNew Kitchen Basics: 10 Essential Ingredients, 120 Recipes,\u201d by Claire Thomson (Quadrille/Hardie Grant, 2019).\n\nTested by Bonnie S. Benwick.
