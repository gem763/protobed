That may change now that Pompeo\u2019s own legacy is on the line.\n\nPompeo, who is the first top administration official to face a Congressional subpoena related to the impeachment inquiry into the President, faces a deadline today. House Democrats gave the Secretary of State until Oct. 4 to turn over any documents related to the President\u2019s controversial July 25 call with the president of Ukraine.\n\nPompeo has not said whether he will comply with or defy Congress\u2019s deadline. But either choice will likely catapult Pompeo into the center of an escalating national drama\u2014and possibly into the crosshairs of a president who values personal loyalty above all else.\n\nText messages released Thursday night upped the stakes. They appear to illustrate just how involved some top U.S. diplomats\u2014including Pompeo\u2014had been in Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in Ukraine and theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

On Wednesday, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Pompeo had in fact been on the phone call, the Secretary of State was forced to admit that he had been listening in.\n\nPompeo has defended the President\u2019s call with Zelenksy, describing it as a legitimate discussion of foreign policy issues and corruption. According to a White House summary of the phone call, the conversation centered on Trump\u2019s request that Zelensky \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by investigating theories about the 2016 election. The conversation took place after the U.S. had delayed foreign aid to the country.\n\nPompeo also criticized Congressional investigators\u2019 requests for more information about the call, saying they \u201ccan be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, in turn, have been increasingly explicit in painting Pompeo as one of Trump\u2019s pawns. In a phone call with her caucus on October 2, Pelosi referred to Pompeo as one of Trump\u2019s \u201chenchman.\u201d\n\nSimilar feelings of distrust have permeated the rank and file at the State Department, where many officials expressed chagrin to TIME about Pompeo\u2019s apparent willingness to defend Trump\u2019s alleged use of foreign policy for his own political gain. One State Department official described Pompeo as Trump\u2019s \u201cenabler.\u201d\n\nSome officials told TIME that they believed Pompeo\u2019s marked deference to the White House is linked to the Secretary\u2019s own political ambitions. Pompeo has long been rumored to have his eye on a Kansas Senate seat, or possibly the White House. Multiple State Department officials told TIME that Pompeo has become consumed by the political battle and is neglecting much of his work as Secretary of State. Nearly two dozen officials told TIME that in recent days Pompeo has become increasingly loud and bullying, and appears frequently distracted and impatient during State Department policy meetings.\n\nIn addition to Pompeo, several senior State Department officials were listening in to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, or later became aware of what had transpired in the conversation, according to the whistleblower complaint, which names several of them. All of those officials are now central witnesses in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Their testimony may illuminate what Pompeo knew about Trump\u2019s plans to ask Zelensky to pursue the investigations.\n\nThe first of these witnesses to testify, Kurt Volker, resigned from his State Department position as Special envoy to Ukraine last week. Volker spent nearly ten hours on Thursday behind closed doors with staffers and lawmakers from the three Congressional committees spearheading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans emerged from the hearing boasting that Volker\u2019s testimony exonerated the President because he did not confirm that the President had demanded the investigations in exchange for security aid. Democrats struck a different tune. \u201cWe learned a lot, a lot of details that will advance our investigation,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence committee, said after Volker\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe text messages made public Thursday night appear to suggest that Pompeo was directly knowledgeable of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations on behalf of the U.S.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and the [White House] meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, texted Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on September 1. Sondland responded, \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\nNine days later, Taylor again expressed his concerns to Sondland. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor said in a text on September 9, calling it his \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nSondland told him to take his concerns to Pompeo\u2019s executive secretary, Lissa Kenna, or \u201cS,\u201d which seems to refer to the Secretary himself.\n\nAt a press conference in Rome on Wednesday, Pompeo defended the efforts to push Ukraine to pursue investigations. \u201cEach of the actions that were undertaken by State Department officials was entirely appropriate and consistent with the objective that we\u2019ve had certainly since this new government has come into office,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the House Democrats\u2019 investigation intensifies, more than two dozen State, Defense and intelligence officials told TIME they are worried that Trump\u2019s mounting preoccupation with the threat of impeachment has given domestic politics even greater influence over foreign and defense policies. These officials said that on numerous fronts, ranging from nuclear negotiations with North Korea to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and relations with allies, Trump has ignored experts in his government, occasionally attacking them both to their faces and behind their backs. They said that Trump was putting foreign policy in the service of his own political agenda.\n\nMany expressed concern over Trump\u2019s decision in May to dismiss the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, because she was allegedly getting in the way of efforts to persuade the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens. The Trump administration found her \u201cinsufficiently loyal to the President and not committed to carrying out his foreign policy,\u201d a U.S. official familiar with her premature departure told TIME in May. Pompeo supported this dismissal, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPompeo was pulled further into the fray on October 2, when State Department\u2019s Inspector General Steve Linick provided House Democrats with an envelope the White House had sent him. The envelope contained folders from the Trump hotel filled with interviews that had taken place at Rudy Giuliani\u2019s New York City office regarding the same Ukraine conspiracy theories. Giuliani subsequently confirmed to a CNN reporter that the documents originated with him.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who attended the meeting with Linick, said he thinks the documents raise questions about Pompeo\u2019s knowledge of Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. \u201cThis does not look good for Pompeo,\u201d he told TIME after the briefing.\n\nRaskin\u2019s Democratic colleagues in the Senate expressed similar concerns. On October 3, Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote for a second time to Linick requesting a formal probe into the State Department\u2019s decision to withhold aid to Ukraine. This time he included a caveat asking for information about Pompeo\u2019s role in the decision.\n\n\u201cThrough information you provided to congressional committees and admissions by [Giuliani] it appears that Secretary Pompeo may have inappropriately and unlawfully leveraged State Department resources \u2013 paid for by U.S. taxpayers \u2013 solely designed to advance President Trump\u2019s personal and political agenda,\u201d Menendez wrote.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry into the alleged politicization of U.S. foreign policy intensifies, many civil servants and Foreign Service officers, some of them in senior roles, are considering leaving the government, according to to multiple officials who spoke to TIME. \u201cI joined the Foreign Service to work for the United States, not for whoever is president, and now politics has become policy,\u201d one State Department official told TIME.\n\nRichard Armitage, who served as deputy Secretary of State under President George W. Bush, said the Ukraine revelations have just fueled the frustration and anger among the U.S. diplomatic corps. The feeling is that Pompeo is allowing State to be used to service Trump\u2019s political agenda.\n\n\u201cThe officials at the State Department, starting with the Secretary of State, are there to serve only one purpose,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cAnd that is the care and feeding of Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com.", "description": "Despite  Pompeo\u2019s well-known ability to steer clear of most high-profile White House drama, he is now embroiled in impeachment", "authors": ["Alana Abramson", "Vera Bergengruen", "John Walcott"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mike-pompeo-ukraine-call.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
