There are just 12 days in session between now and then, so this is becoming a real issue that Washington is going to start focusing on soon. (Please don\u2019t give us the \u201cThey won\u2019t shut down the government\u201d thing. These things are never planned!)\n\nWHAT THEY\u2019RE FOCUSING ON AT MAIN JUSTICE \u2026 NYT\u2019S KATIE BENNER and ADAM GOLDMAN: \u201cJustice Dept. Is Said to Open Criminal Inquiry Into Its Own Russia Investigation\u201d: \u201cJustice Department officials have shifted an administrative review of the Russia investigation closely overseen by Attorney General William P. Barr to a criminal inquiry, according to two people familiar with the matter. The move gives the prosecutor running it, John H. Durham, the power to subpoena for witness testimony and documents, to convene a grand jury and to file criminal charges.\n\n\u201cThe opening of a criminal investigation is likely to raise alarms that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies. Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director under whose watch agents opened the Russia inquiry, and has long assailed other top former law enforcement and intelligence officials as partisans who sought to block his election.\u201d NYT\n\n-- WSJ: \u201cA person familiar with the matter said the time span covered by the inquiry had expanded to examine U.S. intelligence gathering from before the FBI formally opened its investigation in July 2016 to early spring of 2017. Mr. Mueller was appointed in May 2017.\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT says he will go to Nats Park for Game 5 of the World Series between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros -- if the series gets that far. The Nats have to win tonight and Saturday to avoid a Game 5 on Sunday night.\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S DAVID NAKAMURA: \u201c\u2018They\u2019ve got to dress me up in a lot of heavy armor \u2014 I\u2019ll look too heavy,\u2019 he responded when a reporter asked him about whether he would take the mound. Trump appeared to be making a reference to a bulletproof vest that presidents sometimes are required to wear by Secret Service when they are amid large crowds. A team official confirmed later that he will not take part in that on-field tradition.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- DCist\u2019s guide to getting to the park. Read it here\n\nA SHIFT \u2026 WAPO\u2019S MIKE DEBONIS and RACHAEL BADE: \u201cDemocrats say whistleblower\u2019s testimony is unnecessary as other witnesses come forward\u201d: \u201cThe whistleblower who initially unmasked President Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukraine for political favors has moved steadily toward the periphery of the House impeachment inquiry as several Democrats said Thursday they have ample testimony from senior Trump administration officials to back his claims.\n\n\u201cDemocrats were once prepared to take extraordinary steps to preserve the whistleblower\u2019s identity under questioning, considering him central to their investigation. But over the past month, they have grown cold to the idea of exposing him to additional scrutiny after several witnesses described how Trump leveraged access and military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine to launch investigations that could help his 2020 reelection bid.\n\n\u201c\u2018I think it\u2019s quite clear we have a surfeit of evidence that corroborates in full every aspect of what happened and the policy they were pursuing,\u2019 said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), a member of the Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees. A person familiar with the discussions between the whistleblower and House investigators, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks, said Thursday that there are no active efforts to arrange for the individual\u2019s testimony.\u201d WaPo\n\nGood Friday morning.

He said the U.S. stands with demonstrators in Hong Kong and accused Beijing of curtailing the rights and liberties of the city\u2019s residents.\n\n\u201cHua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, blasted Pence\u2019s \u2018arrogance\u2019 and said no force would stop the country\u2019s progress. She accused him of seeking \u2018to disrupt China\u2019s unity or internal stability\u2019 and called Hong Kong, Taiwan and the far west region of Xinjiang \u2018internal affairs.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018The U.S. has already abandoned and cast aside its morality and credibility,\u2019 Hua said. \u2018We hope these Americans can look at themselves in the mirror to fix their own problems and get their own house in order.\u2019\u201d Bloomberg\n\nSO, HE\u2019S NOT BRINGING THE TROOPS HOME \u2026 WSJ: \u201cU.S. Weighs Leaving More Troops, Sending Battle Tanks to Syria,\u201d by Gordon Lubold and Nancy Youssef: \u201cThe White House is considering options for leaving about 500 U.S. troops in northeast Syria and for sending dozens of battle tanks and other equipment, officials said Thursday, the latest in an array of scenarios following President Trump\u2019s decision this month to remove all troops there.\n\n\u201cThe options, presented by military officials, would represent a reversal from the American withdrawal Mr. Trump wanted. It also would modify U.S. objectives\u2014from countering Islamic State extremists to also safeguarding oil fields in eastern Syria with additional troops and new military capability. Washington sees the fields as potential leverage in future negotiations over Syria.\u201d WSJ\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington has taken an interest in the former New York mayor, too, meaning an expansion of resources that indicates the politically sensitive probe into the president\u2019s personal attorney is both broader and moving at a faster pace than previously understood.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- AP: \u201cTrump confronts the limits of impeachment defense strategy,\u201d by Zeke Miller, Jill Colvin and Jonathan Lemire: \u201cAsked about criticism that the White House lacks a coordinated pushback effort and could do a better job delivering its message, spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said, \u2018It\u2019s hard to message anything that\u2019s going on behind closed doors and in secret.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s like you\u2019re fighting a ghost, you\u2019re fighting against the air. So we\u2019re doing the best we can,\u2019 she said on Fox News.\u201d AP\n\n-- NEWSY NUGGETS FROM MIKE SHEAR, MAGGIE HABERMAN AND NICK FANDOS\u2019 NYT IMPEACHMENT LEDEALL: \u201cImpeachment investigators have negotiated in recent days with a lawyer for [John] Bolton about a date for him to be deposed behind closed doors, according to two people briefed on the matter. \u2026\n\n\u201cWhite House aides are planning to add communications aides dedicated to impeachment, a move that Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, has pushed for. Among those under consideration to help lead the new team is Tony Sayegh, who recently left the Treasury Department where he was the top spokesman. White House aides have also discussed bringing on in some capacity Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida and a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s, a person familiar with the conversations said.\u201d\n\n-- CNN: \u201cWhite House official expected to back up diplomat\u2019s testimony over Trump push for Ukraine probe into Bidens\u201d: \u201cTim Morrison, a top Russia and Europe adviser on President Donald Trump's National Security Council, is expected to testify before House impeachment investigators next week and corroborate key elements of a top US diplomat\u2019s account that Trump was pressing for Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into the Bidens before he would greenlight US security assistance, according to sources. \u2026\n\n\u201cMorrison\u2019s testimony is expected to be significant because he is a current White House official whose name was cited 15 times in Taylor\u2019s opening statement, which Democrats view as damning for Trump. Morrison also listened to the July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian leader, CNN reported earlier this month. His testimony would be the first from someone who heard the call directly.\u201d CNN\n\n-- IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY UPDATE \u2026 Saturday: Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs; Monday: Charlie Kupperman, former deputy national security adviser; Tuesday: Lt.

Hill\u2019s legal team \u2014 Marc Elias and Rachael Jacobs of the firm Perkins Coie \u2014 also suggested Hill was defamed over allegations by the Daily Mail that she has a Nazi-inspired tattoo on her body.\n\n\u201cIn a cease-and-desist letter to Candace Trunzo, executive editor of the Daily Mail, Elias and Jacobs demanded that \u2018you remove these photos from publication at once.\u2019 The newspaper ran a series of intimate photos of Hill and a former campaign staffer whom it said she had an affair with before Hill won her seat in Congress. Hill, who is going through an acrimonious divorce, has admitted to an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 relationship with a female campaign staffer and apologized to her constituents over the matter.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Google: Google is making it easier to take back unneeded prescription drugs by displaying disposal locations near you on Google Maps.\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026\n\n-- FUN ONE: \u201cHow South Florida became headquarters of the Trump-Industrial Complex,\u201d by Marc Caputo\n\n-- \u201cSenate Dems on Hillary Clinton 2020: \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019\u201d by Burgess Everett and Marianne LeVine\n\n-- L.A.

Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, introduced a resolution on Thursday that condemns the Democrat-led impeachment probe. The South Carolina Republican has attacked Democrats for their handling of the impeachment process. His resolution \u2014 backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 calls on the House to hold a vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry and to give Republicans the same authority as Democrats to issue subpoenas.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The resolution \u2026 46 co-sponsors so far, per Graham\n\n-- KCRW\u2019s JOSH BARRO (@jbarro): \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable, the text of the resolution is all process complaints, no substantive defense of the president\u2019s behavior.\u201d\n\n-- Axios\u2019 @jonathanswan: \u201cVery much by design.
