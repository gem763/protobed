Mainstream parties held the line, and the European Commission got a center-right leader, Ursula von der Leyen, who has declared her love for the EU.\n\nBut if the populists underperformed at the ballot box and failed to nab key powerful positions, they\u2019re still one of the clear winners of von der Leyen\u2019s new Commission.\n\nThe make-up of the new EU executive, which von der Leyen unveiled on Tuesday, is the result of political compromises in the face of strong pressure. Populist forces have, in effect, set the agenda.\n\nThe new Commission is the result of a process of elimination. Von der Leyen herself was not picked as chief for her vision for Europe; she emerged as a compromise candidate after politicians from the East mounted a rebellion against Socialist front-runner Frans Timmermans. The same is true for the new high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, and the new president of the European Council, Charles Michel. Neither was anybody\u2019s first choice (except perhaps their own).\n\nThe urgency and scale of the migration challenge should have compelled von der Leyen to identify it as needing a \u201csuper commissioner.\u201d\n\nVon der Leyen and her colleagues are no doubt experienced, capable politicians. But faced with a European Parliament and European Council that\u2019s more fragmented than ever before, it will become increasingly difficult for them to sidestep pressure from populist leaders.\n\nVon der Leyen, for example, tied herself up early on by making a number of contradictory promises to political groups in the Parliament, including to migration-critics from Poland and Hungary, to secure her nomination as Commission chief.\n\nHer decision to create the new position of \u201cVice President for Protecting our European Way of Life\u201d (a job she awarded to Margaritis Schinas, the Commission\u2019s former chief spokesperson) is another concession to the populists.\n\nAt first glance, the vague title might suggest that Schinas is in charge of championing the joys of being European. And who wouldn\u2019t want to be in charge of bragging about Europeans\u2019 right to extended vacations and compulsory maternity leave? Sadly, that\u2019s not what von der Leyen had in mind.\n\nInstead, the Greek Commissioner\u2019s job will be to coordinate the EU\u2019s migration and asylum policies, while promoting job growth and integration and making sure that Europeans are protected from terrorist and cyber threats.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that the EU is treating migration as a security question. After all, this is how Brussels has dealt with the fallout of the 2015 migration crisis, and it makes sense from a political point of view. But to be so blunt as to link the need to manage migration with the need to protect Europe\u2019s \u201cway of life\u201d (whatever that means) is taking a page straight out of the populist playbook.\n\nIndeed, a number of MEPs have already voiced their criticism, saying Schinas\u2019 title helps to propagate populists\u2019 claim that there is a link between migration and surges in crime.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest elephant in the room is von der Leyen\u2019s decision to keep the word \u201cmigration\u201d out of Schinas\u2019 title altogether. This confusing, sitting-on-the-fence approach is symptomatic of European mainstream politicians\u2019 failure come up with a coherent narrative on migration.\n\nThe urgency and scale of the migration challenge should have compelled von der Leyen to identify it as needing a \u201csuper commissioner\u201d in charge of it \u2014 as she did for competition and digital affairs, with the appointment of Margrethe Vestager as the vice president for a \u201cEurope fit for the digital age\u201d and commissioner for competition. The role could have encompassed free movement, border controls and common migration and asylum policies.\n\nYou can\u2019t solve the EU\u2019s political migration problem by appealing to the populists.\n\nInstead, von der Leyen seems to have tried to dodge the issue, playing into the populist narrative with one hand, while trying to keep the other from getting dirty \u2014 and in doing so, leaving that part of the political conversation to be dominated by the anti-immigration groups that shout the loudest.\n\nVon der Leyen pledged to lead a \u201cgeopolitical\u201d Commission, in contrast to outgoing President Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s \u201cpolitical\u201d Commission. It\u2019s a commendable approach: She\u2019s taking office at a time of deep political fragmentation in Europe and will have to spend more time building consensus on thorny topics.\n\nBut with her designation of a commissioner to protect \u201cour way of life,\u201d she has undermined her own plans and made the migration portfolio \u2014 already one of the most sensitive \u2014 overtly political.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good start. This may turn out to be her first lesson as Commission president: You can\u2019t solve the EU\u2019s political migration problem by appealing to the populists. You\u2019ll only make them stronger, while a solution remains just as remote.\n\nCamino Mortera-Martinez is a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform working on EU justice and home affairs, migration, criminal law and data protection.", "description": "New power structure shows populist rhetoric has infiltrated EU executive.", "authors": ["Camino Mortera-Martinez", "Florian Eder", "David M.
