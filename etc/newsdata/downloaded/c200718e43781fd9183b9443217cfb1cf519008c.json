But the number of pups came as quite a shock to the pair, who had been told by the vet to expect five or six following an ultrasound appointment.\n\nLeah said: \u2018The vet told us it would take about an hour for each puppy to be born.\n\n\u2018We thought there could be up to eight, so roughly calculated an eight hour labour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But after seven were born in just forty minutes, we were all absolutely gobsmacked. They were just flying out.\u2019\n\nMore than a baker\u2019s dozen (Picture: SWNS)\n\nMum and her pups (Picture: SWNS)\n\nBut the birth did not come without its complications.\n\nOne of the puppies became trapped in Beau\u2019s birth canal because her placenta had come loose. Leah and Alice managed to get the puppy out after 40 minutes, but it wasn\u2019t breathing or moving.\n\nLeah added: \u2018We were all panicking, we thought we had lost her. It took about ten to 15 minutes to get her breathing.\n\n\u2018I used suction equipment to suck all the fluid out of her lungs. It\u2019s a good job I\u2019d done my reading on the subject, or she wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u2019\n\nThe family have called the puppy Hope because of the experience. She is now one of the biggest in the litter.\n\nBeau gave birth to 13 pups (Picture: SWNS)\n\nBeau\u2019s owners helped with the delivery (Picture: KMG/SWNS)\n\nKisses (Picture: SWNS)\n\nAll of the other puppies have been named to match their own unique personalities.\n\nThe boys are called Stormy, Ziggy, Ninja, Danny Dyer, Neon, Stevie and Bear, whereas the girls have been named Hope, Violet, Penelope, Paloma Faith, Penelope and Baby Pink.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeah said: \u2018Stormy was the runt of the litter so we gave him a strong name to give him a boost.\u2019\n\nThe family are keeping two of the puppies for themselves \u2013 Bear and Hope \u2013 but will be selling the other 11 for \u00a3950 each.\n\nIn total, they expect to receive around \u00a310,000 for the black Labrador pups.\n\nMORE: Adventurous dog went on solo bus ride for an hour before anyone noticed\n\nMORE: Primark is selling matching festive PJs for the whole family \u2013 including the dog\n\nMORE: Two sausage dogs make their relationship official with lavish wedding\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Beau, a black Labrador, surprised her owners by giving birth to almost double the litter they were expecting.", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93216989_1572257119.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
