The game was only allowed to happen if the NBA canceled all media opportunities as mandated by the Chinese government. Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s much-anticipated press conference was nixed as well as NBA Cares events that included press opportunities and fan gatherings with ticket-holders.\n\nMeanwhile, in Japan, Houston Rockets PR awkwardly refused to allow James Harden to answer a reporter\u2019s question about if he would refrain from speaking on politics and social justice given the China situation. The league issued a statement saying the representative \u201cinappropriately interjected\u201d and it was \u201cinconsistent with how the NBA conducts media events.\u201d\n\nNow, the NBA simply won\u2019t conduct media events.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe situation takes on a new wrinkle this weekend because Shenzhen is approximately a 27-mile drive from Hong Kong. It\u2019s been one week since Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, creating a disaster that keeps unrolling though it did bring politicians together on the same side in Washington.\n\nLeBron James won't be talking to media in China, nor will any other NBA players or executives.
