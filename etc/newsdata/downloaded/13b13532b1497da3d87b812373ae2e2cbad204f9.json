The origins of the effort to undo the 2016 election date back to former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s March 20, 2017, testimony in front of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been hearing since the election about Trump and Russia,\u201d says Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the intelligence committee. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere in the press. I wanted to get his testimony because I wanted to do as much in public as possible to force them to say they didn\u2019t have anything. I thought Comey would be a calming influence. I thought he would answer questions and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re interviewing a few people, but this is not about the president.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut because the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, code-named Crossfire Hurricane, had nothing on Mr. Trump and because of the emerging evidence of their own wrongdoings, Mr. Comey had to stay on offense.\n\n\u201cThe March 20 hearing was to give the FBI a chance to come clean,\u201d says Mr. Nunes. \u201c\u2018OK, what do you have? You got nothing, and we know it because you never showed it to us.\u2019 We were calling his bluff,\u201d says Mr. Nunes. \u201cAnd Comey doubled down.\u201d\n\nHe announced the FBI\u2019s investigation of \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nMr. Nunes was surprised. \u201cI had no idea he was going to pull that stunt,\u201d says the congressman. \u201cComey leaves the whole world with the impression they were investigating Trump while playing word games that they were only investigating the campaign.\u201d\n\nMr. Nunes later came to realize that Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony had drawn a larger circle around the anti-Trump operation. \u201cAt the time we didn\u2019t know the FBI was in on it,\u201d he says.\n\nThe FBI had been investigating Mr. Trump and his associates since winter 2015\u20132016. It had been monitoring Trump adviser Carter Page\u2019s communications for five months at that point and still had nothing to tie Mr. Trump to the Kremlin. If the conspirators were going to topple Mr. Trump, they needed another instrument. Mr. Comey supplied it.\n\nIn announcing the investigation, Mr. Comey set a trap: if Mr. Trump fired him, he\u2019d become vulnerable to charges of obstructing an ongoing investigation.\n\nIt was the first in a series of obstruction traps designed to hem in the president. Any attempt at self-preservation, to flush out the conspirators who were determined to end his presidency, would only put him in further danger.\n\nThe plotters were counting on the apprentice chief executive to make a mistake. In the meantime, they\u2019d buy themselves enough time and maybe find something else they could use to remove him from the White House. He wasn\u2019t their president, so he wasn\u2019t really the president at all.\n\nImagine that the top military brass is plotting to overthrow the commander in chief. Now move them out of the Pentagon and drop them into the same high-level posts \u2014 number ones, their deputies, deputy assistants, and so on \u2014 at the Justice Department and FBI. It would be a bloodless uprising, not a military putsch. They\u2019d encircle the White House not with tanks but with paper: memos, letters and legal documents as well as falsified reports, such as the Steele dossier.\n\nThe plot against Mr. Trump was a bureaucratic insurgency waged almost entirely through the printed word. It was the \u201cPaper Coup.\u201d\n\nThe earliest evidence of the operation was in print: the press reports alleging the Trump circle\u2019s ties to Russia. The dossier, more paper, moved in tandem with the espionage campaign, dispatching operatives to dirty the Trump team with promises of information damaging to 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Even their dangles were documents: Clinton emails, specifically.\n\nPress accounts were used to secure more paper, a FISA warrant, that magnified the Crossfire Hurricane team\u2019s surveillance powers. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, President Barack Obama ordered the intelligence community assessment, an official document that produced more media reports and legitimized more spying on the Trump administration. News reports of the dossier opened up more channels for the Crossfire Hurricane team to spy on the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd now Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony would engender more paperwork: memos, reports, testimony, leaks of classified information, legal strategies, more news stories. In the hands of the conspirators, veterans of countless bureaucratic wars, it was all the ammunition they needed.\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s memos of his conversations with Mr. Trump unintentionally draw a sympathetic portrait of a Beltway novice who was trying to find his footing in the White House and sought advice from experienced bureaucrats.\n\nMr. Trump didn\u2019t realize at first that they were out to humiliate him, then depose him. He invited Mr. Comey to bring his family to dinner at the White House. The FBI director left an awkward silence for the commander-in-chief to fill. \u201cOr a tour,\u201d said Mr. Trump. \u201cWhatever you think is appropriate.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump complained about the leaked transcripts of his conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico. \u201cIt makes us look terrible to have these things leaking,\u201d he said. He talked about the leak of then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. He said Flynn hadn\u2019t said anything wrong while speaking to Mr. Kislyak. He told Mr. Comey that he hoped he could let it go. The wording was inherently nonobstructive; the president could have directed Mr. Comey to let it go.\n\nMr. Trump told Mr. Comey that he was upset about the Steele dossier\u2019s infamous \u201cgolden shower\u201d story, especially how it had made his wife feel. He said \u201cit bothered him if his wife thought there was even a 1% chance it was true in any respect.\u201d He confided to Mr. Comey, \u201cIt has been very painful.\u201d\n\nHe asked Mr. Comey if the FBI should investigate the Steele dossier. Mr. Comey discouraged him, saying it \u201cwould create a narrative that we were investigating him personally.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to say he wasn\u2019t being investigated. It was bad for everyone. He said \u201che was trying to make deals for the country, the cloud was hurting him.\u201d He assumed that Mr. Comey wanted the same for America and implored him to help by getting out word that the president wasn\u2019t under investigation. Mr. Trump was insistent \u2014 it was hurting his ability to serve Americans. He was trying, he said, \u201cto do work for the country, visit with foreign leaders, and any cloud, even a little cloud, gets in the way of that.\u201d\n\nFinally, Mr. Trump understood that Mr. Comey didn\u2019t see things that way. Mr. Comey saw him not as the president but as a target.\n\nMr. Trump was eagerly waiting confirmation of his new deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. With former Attorney General Jeff Sessions out of the picture and DOJ still controlled by Obama appointees, he didn\u2019t dare move against Mr. Comey. But he was losing his patience.\n\nSoon after taking his post on April 26, Mr. Rosenstein wrote a memo that would justify cutting the FBI chief loose. Mr. Trump attached the memo to his own letter thanking Mr. Comey for \u201cinforming me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenstein\u2019s memo focused on procedure. \u201cThe Director was wrong,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto usurp the Attorney General\u2019s authority\u201d in announcing that the investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server \u201cshould be closed without prosecution.\u201d\n\nDemocrats criticized Mr. Rosenstein for supplying the rationale to oust Mr. Comey. He didn\u2019t understand why he was being blamed, and he lost his bearings.\n\n\u201cHe did the right thing,\u201d says Mr. Nunes. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t handle the pressure coming at him from the Democrats, the anti-Trump Republicans, and the press, so he panicked.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenstein, reportedly dejected and isolated from his peers, was eager to regain the favor of the colleagues whose boss he\u2019d fired. He raised with acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and others the possibility of recording Mr. Trump.\n\nThe aim was to gather evidence to convince administration principals to invoke the 25th Amendment, stipulating that the president may be removed from office when the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet declare that he or she is unable to discharge his duties.\n\nThat option was discarded as too impractical. Instead, the conspirators took the path that Mr. Comey had laid out by testifying before the House intelligence committee: to tie up Mr. Trump with an investigation and set him up for an obstruction of justice charge.\n\nEven after having been involuntarily returned to private life, Mr. Comey played an important role in the Paper Coup. Hours after he was fired, FBI agent Peter Strzok texted FBI lawyer Lisa Page: \u201cWe need to open the case we\u2019ve been waiting on now while Andy is acting.\u201d\n\nThus Mr. McCabe opened an investigation on Mr. Trump after Mr. Comey was let go for failing to state publicly that Mr. Trump was not under investigation. The acting FBI director said he had been worried about what might happen to the Russia case if he were removed. \u201cWas the work,\u201d Mr. McCabe asked himself, \u201con solid ground?\u201d He said he \u201cwanted to protect the Russia investigation in such a way that whoever came after [him] could not just make it go away.\u201d\n\nMr. McCabe knew that Mr. Trump was unlikely to choose him to replace Mr. Comey. And it was possible that the next FBI director would deprioritize or even discontinue the investigation. To lock it in, he urged Mr. Rosenstein to name a special counsel. Even if Mr. Trump hired a loyalist for the director\u2019s job or Mr. McCabe was fired, the investigation would continue.\n\nAppointed by the Department of Justice, the special counsel would now be under the control of the official overseeing the Russia probe, Mr. Rosenstein. The deputy attorney general would now fulfill his promises of goodwill to the Crossfire Hurricane team.\n\nThe strategy required an assist from Mr. Comey himself. He said he had asked a friend to leak to the New York Times his memos, including one memorializing \u201cthe president\u2019s Feb. 14 direction that I drop the Flynn investigation.\u201d Mr. Comey said he had been sure that that would get a special counsel named to the case.\n\nAnd indeed, the day after the Times\u2019 May 16 story sourced to Mr. Comey\u2019s leak of classified information, Mr. Rosenstein wrote a memo appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller special counsel.\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s predecessor at the FBI would continue Mr. Comey\u2019s investigation. From paper to paper to paper, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Comey, Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Mueller had put the Paper Coup on solid ground. Their next move was to try to draw Mr. Nunes into one of their obstruction traps to ensnare Mr. Trump.\n\n\u2022 Lee Smith is a veteran journalist whose work appears in Real Clear Investigations, the Federalist, and Tablet.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
