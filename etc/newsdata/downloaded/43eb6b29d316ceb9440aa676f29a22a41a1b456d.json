At the time, the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) said it was now time for a period of reflection before the dispute \"escalates further and irreparable damage is done to the brand\".\n\nBalpa has said strike action is a \"last resort\" due to \"enormous frustration\" with the management of the airline.\n\nPilots rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which BA proposed in July.\n\nBalpa says its members took lower pay rises and made other sacrifices during tougher times for the airline, and now that BA's financial performance has improved - IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they want a greater share of the profits.", "description": "IAG says the action in a dispute over pay and conditions has cost it at least \u20ac137m.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3532/production/_107781631_british.airways.planes.g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
