Jonathan Baran/The Washington Post\n\nFor Cynthia Craigie, a stay-at-home mother-of-three in California, it is all about what the kids hear.\n\n\"How do you interact with your spouse? How do you interact with the cashier at the convenience store? Do you say 'please' and 'thank you,' or are you on your phone, distracted when you go through the checkout line? Those little things, I've noticed my boys pay attention to and will copy my actions. Manners can be considered a lost art.\"\n\nBut another parent, Tawnya Slater, sees it differently. Watching manners with these devices is to her, in a word, weird. \"You want me to say 'please' to my electronic device? Should I say 'thank you' to my trash can for accepting my trash? How about I ask the freezer to please keep my ice cream frozen,\" she shared in a Facebook group discussing the topic.\n\nWhat makes things more complicated is that digital assistants have an aura of authority, says Dr Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychological Research Center in California. We may know they're not human, but to kids they sound like adults, know lots of stuff and are easy to anthropomorphise. As conversational interfaces and AI evolves further, such distinctions may blur further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Kids learn through repetition, which is why we all say, 'What's the magic word?' infinitum,\" she says.\n\n\"These AI-driven, non-human entities don't care if you sound tired and crabby, or if you are purposely rude because it's 'funny'. But interactions of all kinds build patterns of communication and interaction. The more you are used to bossing Siri around or bullying her, the more you're used to that communication pattern,\" Rutledge says.\n\nSome parents have reported another problem with trying to sound friendly and considerate when talking to Alexa and Google: throwing in extra words when barking out a command may confuse these assistants.\n\nGoogle launched a \"Pretty Please\" feature for the Google Assistant last year after director of product management for the Assistant Lilian Rincon saw her then four-year-old son yelling at the devices.\n\nDr Phillips has another concern. The use of \"please\" and \"thank you\" might, in some sense, cheapen the meaning of such words.\n\n\"When you're talking to very young infants who don't understand it's a machine and we want them to hear kind engagement with other people, it stands to reason that we should be using manners,\" says Phillips. \"When kids are older and understand that Alexa isn't a person, we don't want them to use those words in an automatic way. We say 'thank you' and 'I'm sorry' and 'please' because there's a relational piece to our communication and our words impact other people.\"\n\nGetting positive reinforcement\n\nAmazon determined politeness counts when it introduced the Echo Dot Kids Edition last year. When youngsters ask Alexa to solve a maths problem while exhibiting good manners \u2013 \"Alexa, please tell me what 5 plus 7 is\" \u2013 the voice inside the Echo will not only supply the right answer but will then add positive reinforcement \u2013 \"By the way, thanks for asking so nicely\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \"magic word\" feature, as Amazon called it, was an apparent response by the company to a loud chorus of customers who were concerned that the act of rudely commanding Alexa to do something sent out the wrong kind of message, especially to the youngest members of the family.\n\nGoogle launched a similar \"Pretty Please\" feature for the Google Assistant last year after director of product management for the Assistant Lilian Rincon saw her then four-year-old son yelling at the devices to play his favourite Disney songs.\n\n\"I quickly realised we needed a way to help promote polite behaviour, not only for kids but also for all people who now welcome digital assistants to their homes,\" she says.\n\nSenior marketing manager Dana Turner says her husband has come up with another sound reason for treating voice assistants nicely. \"He always says 'thank you' to her because, he says, one day AI is going to take over the world and he wants to be saved.\"\n\nMCT", "description": "Talking rudely to your digital assistant can be funny but it also sets a bad example to younger family members.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2147%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_130%2C$y_119/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1b52ebc3bf1cf8664c48e79044519ffc4b303de6", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
