Mark Warner on Monday called for Republicans to condemn President Trump\u2019s attacks on the anonymous Ukraine phone-call whistleblower, saying it poses a safety concern.\n\n\u201cMy hope would be that even my Republican colleagues who may not want to weigh in on the substance of the complaint need to stand up and push back on this president\u2019s outrageous behavior,\u201d the Virginia Democrat told CNN.\n\nThe whistleblower who accused Mr. Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joseph R. Biden, has been labeled a \u201ctraitor\u201d by the president.\n\nMr. Trump also called the whistleblower a spy saying such actions were handled differently.\n\n\u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nIt was reported Sunday that lawyers for the whistleblower wrote a letter to the chairmen and ranking members \u2014 including Mr. Warner \u2014 of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee expressing serious concerns for their client\u2019s safety.\n\nMr. Warner is the vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe lawyers said several unnamed parties have offered a $50,000 bounty for information leading to the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cAny rational person would be concerned about the whistleblower\u2019s safety after the president\u2019s comments, which lead from some press outlets on the right who were actually offering a bounty on trying to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr. Warner declined to say if Mr. Trump\u2019s comments amounted to witness tampering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stick with the most obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most obvious is that this is an attempt to undermine the protections of the whistleblower program. I believe this falls into the category of reprisal and it needs to stop.\u201d\n\nMr. Warner repeated his calls for Republicans to condemn the president\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cI would hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will speak out in a unified voice because of the chilling effect it will have, not only on this individual\u2026. but the overall effect on people in the intelligence community speaking truth to power,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat would be a scar for a long time to come.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
