Meanwhile, the economy is sinking.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about recession coming in the United States after dismal readings on two closely watched forward indicators from the Institute for Supply Management this week. But despite the terrible numbers, there\u2019s nothing inevitable about a recession.\n\nRead the news here: U.S. manufacturers experience worst month since 2009\n\nAnd here: Service side of economy grows at slowest pace in three years\n\nU.S. business activity is growing quite slowly.\n\nThey don\u2019t have much confidence in their forecasts, but most economists still think a recession will be avoided.\n\nNo one knows what Donald Trump will do next. He\u2019s the X factor in every economist\u2019s model, in every company\u2019s business plan.\n\nThey don\u2019t see the usual imbalances that precede a recession. Warehouses are not stuffed with unsold goods. The Federal Reserve hasn\u2019t squeezed the economy. Credit is not tight. Household balance sheets are in good shape. Most corporations are flush with cash, and few are overextended. Job growth is still good and incomes are still rising.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the economy is in \u201ca good place.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, global growth is softening, even aside from President Trump\u2019s tariff games, but the U.S. generally hasn\u2019t been vulnerable to global business cycles in the modern era.\n\nIn other words, there are pockets of concern, but nothing obvious that would push the economy over the edge in normal times. But these times are not normal.\n\nNo one\u2019s like Trump\n\nSimply put, there\u2019s no precedent for our current predicament, which stems almost entirely from the unilateral demands of the U.S. president to rewrite the rules of trade \u2014 which is to say, rewrite the rules of global commerce.\n\nNow read: Trump\u2019s got the whole world economy in his hands \u2014 but who elected him king?\n\nNo one knows what Donald Trump will do next. He\u2019s the X factor in every economist\u2019s model, in every company\u2019s business plan. But businesses must plan ahead, and right now many of them are seriously contemplating the worst-case scenarios.\n\nUsually, the main unknown for businesses is future demand for their product. But now there\u2019s an additional worry: The availability and price of crucial inputs for their production process.\n\nThe direct impact of the trade war has been modest, but indirect effects are growing. A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and no one knows where all the crucial junctures are.\n\nFor want of a nail, the kingdom was lost \u2014 or so the proverb goes. The worst-case scenario for any business could be that a vital input will be unavailable for an extended period at any price.\n\nThis is why the Federal Reserve is so impotent now. It has cut interest rates and will probably cut again and again. But to what effect? The problem is not the price of credit or the availability of credit, but the existence of the supply chain itself.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nEveryone has their own theory about what Trump will do next. But none of them are any good, because Trump\u2019s secret power is his inscrutability and his disdain for the conventional wisdom about what a self-interested politician \u201cought\u201d to do in any situation.\n\nSome think he will notice what he\u2019s doing to the stock market and the economy. He\u2019ll back off on his trade war with the Chinese, and cruise to re-election in 2020 as the man who saved the economy.\n\nBut others think Trump could double down on the trade war because he won\u2019t want to be seen as weak, especially when he\u2019s under attack from so many directions. The lessons of the Kavanaugh confirmation and the Mueller Report and the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes \u2014 no retreat, no surrender \u2014 cannot be unlearned.\n\nOr he could do something diabolically clever, like bargain with Chinese President Xi Jinping to get the dirt on the Bidens and the other Democrats in exchange for dropping the tariffs.\n\nNo wonder business confidence is crumbling. We\u2019re at the mercy of an unpredictable, cornered and extremely powerful narcissist.\n\nRex Nutting is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "What will Trump do next?
