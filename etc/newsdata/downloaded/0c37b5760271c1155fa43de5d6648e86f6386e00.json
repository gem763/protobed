While uncommon, recent reported cases of the cryptosporidium parasite have set people on edge. Here\u2019s what you need to know about this nasty bug, how to prevent it from spreading and how to avoid it.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nCryptosporidium \u2014 or \u201ccrypto\u201d for short \u2014 is the leading cause of outbreaks of diarrhoea linked to water in the United States, according to U.S. health authorities. This parasite causes cryptosporidiosis, which is described as \u201ca profuse, watery diarrhoea\u201d that can last up to three weeks in otherwise healthy adults. It can be much worse for children, pregnant individuals and those with compromised immune systems.\n\nCryptosporidium is common around the world, including in Australia.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s almost never fatal: There has only been one death reported since 2009, and in this case, the transmission occurred between two people in a hospital, not a pool. Still, you definitely do not want three weeks of profuse, watery diarrhoea, which can lead to conditions like dehydration and cause you to wind up in the hospital.\n\nBut aren\u2019t poop-related illnesses transmitted through public pools old news at this point? Sort of, but given that there were 444 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks reported in 40 states and Puerto Rico between 2009 and 2017 \u2014 with the number of cases increasing by an average of 12.8 per cent annually. Either way, Crypto is something you\u2019re going to want to avoid.\n\nCrypto and kids\n\nThe parasite disproportionately affects children ages one through five for several reasons. First, kids in this age group may not be fully toilet trained. Second, they like to hop between various water attractions at public pools, like the kiddie pool, splash pads and perhaps the main pool as well, giving them the chance to contaminate (or be contaminated by) everything. Finally, younger children are more likely to ingest pool water and everything that comes in it, making them easy targets.\n\nHow to prevent the spread\n\nThere are a few things you can do to help stop the spread of crypto. First, if you have diarrhoea, stay out of the pool. That definitely applies to kids too, for reasons outlined above. Staying out of pools for at least two weeks after having diarrhoea is recommended.\n\nAlso, anyone coming in contact with livestock should wash their hands thoroughly after they\u2019re done. This is a good idea in general, but definitely something you should do before hopping in a pool. And finally, if your kid is having diarrhoea, keep them out of child care.\n\nYes, public pools are chlorinated, but crypto has a high tolerance to chlorine and can survive in a properly chlorinated pool for up to seven days.\n\nHow to avoid crypto\n\nSo how can people stay safe this pool season? Unfortunately, there\u2019s no secret trick to protect yourself from it other than avoiding public pools (or any pools with children) and definitely not swallowing pool water.\n\nIf you know there\u2019s been a crypto outbreak, use hydrogen peroxide to clean surfaces rather than bleach because it inactivates cryptosporidium oocysts.", "description": "If your holiday plans involve a trip to the public pool, you might need to exercise caution.
