I personally think he\u2019s their best player.\n\n\u2018In terms of ability and talent he\u2019s the best player at the club.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a luxury player, and the manager has obviously decided he can\u2019t carry a player like that in a team that\u2019s already one of the worst around without the ball.\n\n\u2018Unai Emery should bring him in from the cold. But he won\u2019t.\n\n\u2018If he plays Ozil and they win, he has to keep playing him, and the manager doesn\u2019t want that. The manager wants him out.\n\n\u2018And if that\u2019s the plan then they are going to have to swallow a pill and get rid of him in January come what may.\n\n\u2018Emery has been getting good performances out of Dani Ceballos, Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson.\n\n\u2018But I thought Ozil was Arsenal\u2019s best player against Watford and he hasn\u2019t played since. That shocked me to be honest.\u2019\n\nMORE: Unai Emery could lose Arsenal job if Gunners fail to qualify for Champions League\n\nMORE: Kieran Tierney teases injury return for Arsenal teammate Alexandre Lacazette", "description": "Arsenal legend Paul Merson admits he has been shocked by Unai Emery's treatment of Mesut Ozil.
