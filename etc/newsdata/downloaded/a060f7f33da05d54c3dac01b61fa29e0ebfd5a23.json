Then he added: \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\nPutin continued: \u201cYou know, we have enough of our own problems. We are engaged in resolving internal problems and are primarily focused on this.\u201d\n\nPutin appeared to make light of evidence of Russian interference in U.S. elections, as President Donald Trump has done in the past.\n\nAt a summit with Putin last year, Trump infamously questioned whether Russia actually meddled in the 2016 presidential election in spite of widespread consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies. He later attempted to walk back his comments but continued to indicate he didn\u2019t take the matter seriously.\n\nAt the June G-20 summit in Japan, Trump jokingly told Putin to stay out of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election,\u201d he said, smiling at Putin and wagging his finger. Putin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was seated nearby, both chuckled.\n\nTrump in 2017 allegedly told two senior Russian officials he wasn\u2019t concerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the U.S. election, claiming the U.S. had interfered in other countries\u2019 elections.\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s official standpoint is that it won\u2019t tolerate election interference by Russia or any other foreign nation.\n\n\u201cWith its efforts to meddle in elections across Europe and around the world now is the time for us to remain vigilant about the intentions and the actions being taken by Russia,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said at news conference in Warsaw, Poland last month.\n\nPompeo has also warned foreign agents about repercussions if they meddled in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear: We will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThe United States will continue to push back against malign actors who seek to subvert our democratic processes.\u201d\n\nThe secretary made the comment after it was revealed he listened in on Trump\u2019s July phone call pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nPutin on Wednesday also commented on the phone call and claimed he had encouraged the White House to release details about his own conversation with Trump last year in Helsinki.\n\n\u201cWhen there were attempts to launch a scandal regarding my meeting with Trump in Helsinki \u2014 we directly told the administration to just publish it. If somebody wants to know something \u2014 just publish it, we don\u2019t mind,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI assure you there was nothing to that would have compromised President Trump there.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRudy Giuliani Backs Out Of Appearance At Russian-Sponsored Conference\n\nNervous Kremlin Warns U.S. Against Releasing Transcripts Of Trump's Calls With Putin\n\nTrump Reportedly Said He Didn't Care About Russian Interference In Elections\n\nLove HuffPost?
