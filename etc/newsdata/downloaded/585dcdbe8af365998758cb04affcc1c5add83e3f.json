A recent controversy in Madison, Wisc., exemplifies the contradictions required to feed the narrative of America\u2019s endemic bigotry.\n\nA black senior at West High School in Madison allegedly stole another student\u2019s cell phone on October 9. The alleged thief then pushed an assistant principal who tried to intervene; she called for assistance. A black security guard, Marlon Anderson, tried to escort the student out of the building; the student let fly a race-based tirade, calling Anderson the N-word and a slew of racial epithets. Anderson, repeating the word, told the student to \u201cStop calling me that.\u201d The assistant principal started recording the interaction on her walkie-talkie \u2014 to document not the student\u2019s insubordination but, rather, Anderson\u2019s.\n\nAnderson had violated the Madison Metropolitan School District\u2019s (MMSD) zero-tolerance policy toward the N-word. Any iteration of the word, with whatever intent, by school staff would result in the user\u2019s firing. According to Interim School Superintendent Jane Belmore, the district adopted the policy in order to \u201cunequivocally protect\u201d black students.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt least six MMSD teachers and staff members were fired or forced to resign over the last year for mentioning the N-word in front of students. The district has refused to discuss the circumstances of their removal. But the Madison teachers union says it is unaware of any instance where a staff member or teacher used the word to refer to students with derogatory intent. In one case, a teacher in an alternative high school was reading from a book that contained the word. (The district would not say what book.)\n\nNone of these firings and resignations triggered protests, probably because the teachers, presumably, were white. The removals were welcomed by Madison\u2019s activists. A Madison district spokeswoman told the Wisconsin State Journal in reference to the alternative high school teacher: \u201cIt has simply never been OK for an educator to use a racial slur with children.\u201d The N-word \u201cis based in extreme hatred and violence and causes deep harm,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cIt is essential to our core values and beliefs that we not tolerate that kind of harm to our children, our families and our staff.\u201d\n\nMadison\u2019s zero-tolerance policy, however, ignores the distinction between using and mentioning a word. Speakers use words to refer to specific people or events. Speakers mention words not to refer to any particular person or thing, but rather to focus on the word itself as a linguistic object of using such words to denigrate rather than mentioning them in a different context. If one is reading a passage, say, of James Baldwin or Ta-Nehisi Coates that contains the N-word, one\u2019s recitation of the word does not refer to any particular person; it is simply repeating the word in an abstract context.\n\nContemporary racial practice, however, treats certain words as magical talismans, capable of inflicting harm on official victim groups regardless of how those words are used or even of their meaning, as protests over the academic term \u201cmaster\u201d reveal. This magical view of language has been lethal to many a career, in K-12 schools as well as in colleges and universities.\n\nIt is a safe bet that the only appearance of such racial epithets in mainstream white society today is as a mention, not a use. To generate a sufficient number of racist incidents to ground the anti-racism religion therefore requires suspending the use-mention distinction. But if reinstating that distinction will itself generate a racial crisis, then it will be resurrected in the blink of an eye. And that is what happened in Madison over the last two weeks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMarlon Anderson was fired under a policy allowing no discretion on the part of school administrators and therefore providing no outlet for unconscious bias to creep in. As West High School\u2019s principal told parents in a letter informing them of Anderson\u2019s suspension: \u201cAs you know, our expectation when it comes to racial slurs has been very clear. Regardless of context or circumstance, racial slurs are not acceptable in our schools.\u201d\n\nThis would be the last defense of the zero-tolerance policy before Anderson\u2019s firing was converted into a glaring instantiation of the Madison school district\u2019s ongoing bias. Now it was precisely the failure to distinguish a word\u2019s use from its mention that constituted the racial sin.\n\nThe first to resurrect the use-mention distinction was Anderson himself. \u201cSo if the class is reading \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019 and the teacher is reading the book out loud and it gets to the part where the N-word is, the teacher gets fired?\u201d Anderson asked incredulously. Well, yes. That is exactly what has happened to teachers in Madison and elsewhere.\n\nA charter school operator wrote on Facebook: \u201cI am so glad Marlon is fighting this. In Marlon\u2019s case, the word was not used as a slur. It was not used toward anyone. He was simply telling the student to stop calling him that.\u201d\n\nCommunity activist Brandi Grayson, co-founder of the Young, Gifted & Black Coalition, demanded that the district rewrite the behavior policy to \u201censure that context matter [sic] so both students and school staff are protected.\u201d\n\nAnti-racists across the country assailed Madison for its anti-slur policy. Arne Duncan Arne Starkey DuncanWhat the next Education secretary must do How Democrats learned to stop worrying and love teachers Obama Education Secretary: US education system is 'top 10 in nothing' MORE, President Obama\u2019s secretary of education, mocked the \u201ccrazy\u201d and heartless Madison school district. \u201cJust more evidence our country still can\u2019t handle issues of race, and racism,\u201d Duncan tweeted. Cher asked how \u201cppl\u201d can \u201cBe This Disrespectful\u201d and offered to pay Anderson\u2019s legal expenses if he sued the district for discrimination.\n\nMadison\u2019s high school students snapped into protest mode. Anderson\u2019s son Noah, president of the West Black Student Union, organized a school walk-out and march to the school district headquarters. His father had been a \u201csacrifice\u201d for long-standing racial tension in the MMSD, Noah Anderson told the media, but the walk-out would help \u201cfix some of the race inequities.\u201d\n\nNoah invoked Martin Luther King Jr., implicitly connecting the racial injustices protested by King to the one suffered by his father. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be like MLK over here,\u201d he told the student throng through a bullhorn. Protest signs read \u201cBlack Staff Matter,\u201d \u201cContext Matters,\u201d \u201cWest Staff Stands With Marlon and For Justice\u201d and \u201cDo Better.\u201d\n\nThe local and national press covered the march as a milestone in racial justice, with reporters and cameramen walking along with the crowd to capture the mood. Not one press outlet asked how the MMSD\u2019s previous unchallenged applications of the zero-tolerance policy differed from Anderson\u2019s case.\n\nThe anti-racism religion requires that any mainstream institution accused of racism fall on its sword and cop to the charge, whether true or not. School board president Gloria Reyes announced that the board would review its anti-slur policies through a \u201cracial equity lens, understanding that universal policies can often deepen inequities.\u201d After Anderson was reinstated in his job, Reyes reiterated the need to continue examining the bigotry that had produced the zero-tolerance policy: \u201cThis is an opportunity for the board to ... dive deep into the issues of racism in our schools.\u201d\n\nThe Madison authorities now face a difficult choice. They could adopt a race-conscious standard that says it is permissible for blacks but not whites to use or mention the N-word; this would codify existing practice. Alternatively, they could reinstate the use-mention distinction; doing so would raise the question of the white teachers and staffers who lost their jobs over a mention, as well as of the student who used the N-word derogatorily against Anderson, only to immediately disappear from official and media attention.\n\nOr the authorities could do the unthinkable: Acknowledge that Madison schools are among the most tolerant, opportunity-filled institutions on earth and call on everyone to return joyfully to those schools\u2019 core mission: Teaching and learning.\n\nHeather Mac Donald is the Thomas W.
