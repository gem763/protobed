Meanwhile, more Islamic State fighters came from Tunisia than any other nation.\n\n\u201cThere is a disappointment with what democracy has produced so far since the revolution. It has been eight years and people\u2019s lives haven\u2019t got any better,\u201d Anthony Dworkin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Euronews.\n\n\u201cThe economy is still a mess [...]. People are losing faith in the nation\u2019s democratic system. There\u2019s this real sense that all these politicians are the same, and that creates an opening.\u201d\n\nWant more news?", "description": "The Arab Spring's sole success story elects a replacement for Beji Caid Essebsi.", "authors": ["Orlando Crowcroft"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/15/55/00/1000x563_cmsv2_6413a9c2-d4a8-5ba0-b410-354fb6cd9936-4155500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
