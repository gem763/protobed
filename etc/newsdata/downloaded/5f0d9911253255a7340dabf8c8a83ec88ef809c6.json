The problem with Malaysia Airlines is actually a problem with our aviation industry as a whole,\u201d Shahril told the bipartisan PAC when summoned in April to explain Khazanah\u2019s massive RM6.3 billion loss.\n\nKhazanah, through its subsidiary Malaysian Aviation Group Bhd, fully owns MAB.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Malaysia today, we actually have four home carriers \u2015 Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia, AirAsia X and Malindo \u2015 in the market of 30 million people and a massive oversupply where effectively you have roughly about 1.7 seats for every actual customer,\u201d Shahril said.\n\nHe was replying to Subang MP Wong Chen, who said that political feedback indicated that the reality about MAB is different from how it is perceived in the public.\n\nShahril said the problem with the industry is with the amount of revenue and not cost, as most airlines have managed very well in cutting down on the latter.\n\nHe also warned that the situation is bound to get worse for the region, as it has the most number of new aircrafts coming in between AirAsia and Malindo\u2019s parent group Lion Group over the next five years.\n\nShahril also pointed to Malaysia\u2019s \u201copen sky policy\u201d, which allows any carrier to fly into Malaysia instead of providing more flights for local-based airlines.\n\n\u201cSo, the policy has been good for Malaysia in terms of boosting total passenger numbers, total tourist numbers but it has been terrible for the local airlines, because it essentially, you have cut into the revenue stream by forcing downward pressure on prices in terms of consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then suggested that typically to reduce the excess capacity in an industry, the weakest players would quit the market, or a consolidation of capacity and operation to rationalise the industry as a whole.\n\n\u201cIf things were to carry on like this, what essentially it means is that the shareholder of all four airlines, not just Malaysia Airlines, will have to keep pumping money in to sustain operation of their airlines,\u201d he said, adding that AirAsia sets to benefit the most since it has the lowest cost.\n\nReverting to the suggestion later, Wong jokingly asked: \u201cIn that case, we just keep supporting you RM1 billion a year for seven years and wait for Malindo to close? [Laughs] I mean that is the strategy, right? [Laughs]\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, probably not best for me to comment on that one,\u201d Shahril replied, to laughter from the room.\n\nOn Tuesday, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali said the government will appoint a strategic partner to take over MAB within the next few months.\n\nAzmin told Parliament that four potential bidders have been shortlisted from 20 received by Khazanah and the airlines\u2019 parent company Malaysian Aviation Group Bhd.\n\nThe sovereign wealth fund has been trying to get MAB off its hands after a botched RM6 billion capital injection since 2014, as well as a massive restructuring which saw the termination of 6,000 employees.\n\nPAC said it is satisfied with Khazanah\u2019s explanation over its RM6.3 billion loss last year, which was due to: a change in the government\u2019s telecommunication policy, financial reporting standards, and a change in investment strategy.\n\nRelated Articles Too few local biz class flyers to keep Malaysia Airlines airborne, Khazanah concludes Why did Khazanah lose RM6.3b in 2018?
