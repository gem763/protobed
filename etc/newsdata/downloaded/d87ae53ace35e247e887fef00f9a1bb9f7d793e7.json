Again I ask, where is the consistency?\"\n\nMkhwebane also likened herself to judges, in terms of her office having similar powers.", "description": "Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has once again taken aim at President Cyril Rampahosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, questioning the consistency of the president's actions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/d56ae294783f4ca7b1f8aa285cbbeb19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
