Cutoffs began after midnight local time Wednesday, with the first phase impacting about 513,000 customers.\n\n\u201cThe decision to turn off power was based on forecasts of dry, hot and windy weather including potential fire risk,\u201d PG&E said on Wednesday, adding that the utility expects the weather event to last through midday local time Thursday, bringing peak winds that are expected to reach 60 to 70 miles per hour.\n\nAltogether, more than 2 million people may be affected, based on city estimates and the average size of a U.S. household. The city of San Francisco was outside of the shutoff zone as of Tuesday.\n\nNever before has a utility planned such a widespread shutoff affecting so many customers at once to avoid a wildfire in California. It\u2019s the latest testament to how climate change-driven extreme weather is forcing people and businesses alike to adapt. This week\u2019s outage will mark the first time PG&E has coordinated a blackout in a major metropolitan area. Previous ones involved rural areas prone to wildfires.\n\nPG&E is advising its customers to ensure they have sufficient supplies of emergency items like medicines, first aid supplies, flash lights and batteries. But some people are resorting to more extreme measures, with residents of the San Francisco Bay area checking into hotels once they found out their homes were within the outage area, according to a report by ABC 7 News.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize what an outage really means,\u201d Marilyn Varnado, one of people, told the station. \u201cStop lights are not going to be working, there\u2019s going to be a lot of crazy things going on and I just think there\u2019s going to be some tragedies because of that,\u201d she said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "It's the latest testament to how climate change-driven extreme weather is forcing people and businesses alike to adapt", "authors": ["David R.
