Last week, officials announced that 431 more sites would be closed for the same reason.\n\nGovernment opponents, however, charge that some of the new closures \u2014 which will bring the number of shuttered sites to about 31 percent of the total \u2014 are the result of political manipulation to favor President Ashraf Ghani, who is running for reelection, rather than bona fide security concerns.\n\nThe Sept. 28 poll, which comes just weeks after the collapse of U.S.-Taliban peace talks, will essentially be a rematch between Ghani and his major challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, who is currently the government\u2019s chief executive, although 15 other candidates are officially running.\n\nSupporters of Abdullah and others charge that some sites are belatedly being closed to benefit Ghani. They point out that most are located in northern provinces that are considered relatively safe or are more likely to vote for Abdullah, based on past ethnic and political loyalties.\n\n\u201cThis has been planned carefully. They have made certain areas insecure so they can stuff ballot boxes,\u201d said Mohammed Nateqi, an adviser to Abdullah. In 2014, Abdullah also ran against Ghani in a bitter, inconclusive contest that ended with the Obama administration persuading the two men to form a power-sharing pact.\n\n\n\nIn this photo taken Sept.16, 2019, an Afghan employee of the Independent Election Commission moves ballot boxes during preparations for the upcoming presidential election at a warehouse in Kabul.

Last month, 13 previous election officials were sent to prison for graft, and public mistrust of the newly staffed election apparatus remains high.\n\nGhani and his aides have brushed off charges of trying to fix the election, and most observers expect him to win outright with with more than half the ballots. But the polling site complaints have acquired sudden importance because Ghani and his government, closely allied with Washington and heavily dependent on U.S. support, have come under unexpectedly sharp criticism from the Trump administration.\n\nThis development is widely seen here as giving a last-minute boost to Abdullah\u2019s chances. He has suddenly stepped up his campaign schedule after a slow start. With both a close vote and low turnout predicted, the closures could make a significant difference.\n\nAmerican preference, either explicit or inferred, is considered a key factor in Afghan elections. The United States has spent more than $800 billion helping to rebuild Afghanistan since 2001 and has sent more than 100,000 troops to defend it. Ghani was long viewed in Washington as a high-minded technocrat and a modernizing force for the struggling country.\n\nBut Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a sharply worded statement Thursday, said the administration would cut $100 million in funds for an Afghan energy project due to government corruption and mismanagement. He also criticized two of Ghani\u2019s high-priority programs to monitor public spending and contracting, saying they had not been \u201ctransparent\u201d or accountable.\n\n\n\nAfghanistan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah speaks during a debate at which the incumbent, President Ashraf Ghani, failed to show up, in Kabul, Sept. 16, 2019. (Rahmat Gul/AP)\n\n\u201cWe expect the Afghan government to demonstrate a clear commitment to fight corruption, to serve the Afghan people and to maintain their trust,\u201d he said. \u201cAfghan leaders who fail to meet this standard should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nPompeo also said the U.S. administration has \u201ccalled repeatedly\u201d for the Afghan government and electoral institutions to prepare a \u201ccredible and transparent presidential election. . . . We hold all candidates accountable to the code of conduct they signed.\u201d\n\nSome analysts said these comments reflect U.S. officials\u2019 pique at Ghani\u2019s anger and foot-dragging after being sidelined from the U.S.-Taliban talks, not just concern over corruption or election fraud. There has been no sign that Washington would view Abdullah as a preferable choice, although the polished former foreign minister is a familiar figure to U.S. officials.\n\nNevertheless, the timing and tone of the criticism have come as a shock here and intensified domestic concerns that Ghani may resort to desperate measures to win. The poll closures, meant to protect voters from violence, are now seen by some as denying them the right to vote.\n\n\u201cThe government has engaged on in a lot of wrongdoing, including about the polling stations,\u201d said Ahmad Wali Massood, a presidential candidate. \u201cIn places that are secure, they are closing the stations because they know Dr. Ghani will not get votes, and in some insecure places where he has support, they are leaving them open. The whole thing is upside down.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said they plan to deploy more than 70,000 security forces to protect the open polls, but they never publicly released the locations of the 2,000 that were initially closed. Most were assumed to be in rural areas under Taliban threat or control, largely in the south and southeast.\n\nIn interviews earlier this month, officials from several Taliban-plagued provinces described a mixed picture of voting conditions. In southeastern Ghazni, which has faced longtime Taliban threats, officials said some districts would be safe for voters, some were too dangerous to open any polling centers, and in others that were relatively secure, centers had been closed for political reasons.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban can wage terror here. Our main city is under siege, and they control about half of the districts. People will be scared,\u201d said Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament from Ghazni. But he also said that in some peaceful districts dominated by ethnic minority Hazaras, \u201cthe government knows Ghani will not get the votes, so they have deliberately closed polling stations.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Fawad Aman, said the security and closure plans were still changing day by day. In Ghazni, he said some districts had recently been recaptured by security forces, but that because they had been in Taliban hands during voter registration, no polls could open.\n\nWhen the government announced the 431 new closures, it listed them by province. To widespread public surprise, some with the most shuttered sites were in relatively safe or pro-Abdullah areas. Balkh, a northern province with few Taliban problems that strongly backed Abdullah in 2014, had the highest number, with 89 sites to be closed. Gohr, a remote northwestern province, was second with 66 closures.\n\nYusuf Rashid, director of the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, said fear of insurgent attacks remains the greatest concern for voters, but that the difficulty of recruiting poll-watchers and transporting election materials \u201cwill create opportunities for fraud and make it hard to challenge the validity of ballots.\u201d This time, he said, \u201cthe stakes are higher, but the scrutiny will be lower.\u201d\n\nIn Farah, a far western province that has been besieged by Taliban attacks, officials said the insurgents now control more areas than they did a year ago, when only a fraction of 600,000 registered voters cast ballots for members of parliament. Many polling stations will likely be shut, including 11 whose closures were announced last week.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban are everywhere. Even in the capital they force teachers and government workers to pay them taxes,\u201d said Belquis Roshan, a legislator from Farah. \u201cIt is even worse in rural areas. There is no sign of election activity at all. This time, I doubt even 10,000 people will vote.\u201d\n\nSayed Salahuddin and Sharif Hassan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Low turnout is expected in some areas, fraud in others.", "authors": ["Pamela Constable", "Foreign Correspondent Covering Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "South Asia", "Latin America", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ea10it-80zLB6_7Y8D6Z-kvneGs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SD7XG3W57MI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
