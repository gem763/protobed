While this was only marginally below the analyst estimate, there was a notable downward revision for the prior reading from 195,000 to 157,000.\n\nEarlier in the week, the ISM reported the manufacturing index to contract for the first time in three years. The sector appears to be weak globally as trade war concerns have weighed.\n\nFurther exacerbating the issue, the White House announced on Wednesday their intentions to expand the trade war out to Europe. Officials said they would place a 10% tariff on Airbus planes made in Europe and 25% on certain alcohol products as well as cheese.\n\nThe measures are set to take effect on October 18. Negotiations are to take place ahead of that and the European Union will attempt to strike some kind of a deal to prevent the new tariffs.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe dollar is under a bit of pressure in the early week although it has gained against the commodity currencies.\n\nEURUSD Daily Chart More\n\nEUR/USD is seen trading near a horizontal level at 1.0966 which marks the lowest daily close in the first half of September. While the pair could pull back a bit here, I think we will see the recovery extend a bit higher.\n\nThere is some major resistance in play in around 1.0996, or essentially the 1.1000 handle. The level carry psychological implications amd carries confluence with the upper bound of a trend channel that has contained price action since late June.\n\nEURUSD 4-Hour Chart More\n\nWhile the pair holds above the important 1.0930 level, I expect it will attempt one more leg higher to test this important resistance area.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEUR/USD is recovering higher, boosted by weak US data\n\nA major resistance confluence comes into play at 1.0996.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "After briefly trading below 1.0900 in the early week, EUR/USD has managed to print two consecutive days in the green for the first time since the September ECB meeting.", "authors": ["Jignesh Davda"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YY1SlYTupZeN65ZoO0KZlA--~B/aD0zNzY7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/aa6c05efb533c3c1e1a9e79f35c2fcc1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
