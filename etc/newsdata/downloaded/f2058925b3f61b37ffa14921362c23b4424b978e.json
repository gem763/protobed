And if that happens, I know that you will want, and I would want for you, the full force of the law. And immigration is part of that full force.'\n\nOfficials have used charged rhetoric to highlight cases of crimes committed by illegal immigrants.\n\nSergei Waybourn is the son of Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn (seen above at the White House on Thursday. Waybourn said releasing jailed immigrants instead of turning them over to ICE would lead to more children being maimed or killed in car crashes because some of those prisoners are repeat drunk-drivers\n\nThe acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Matt Albence (center) said Thursday that agency is administering DNA tests to migrants 'to ferret out the false families' taking advantage of rules governing the detention of children\n\nMigrants from Honduras wait in line at the Mexico-United States border crossing in Tijuana. Albence said the DNA tests have assisted in the prosecution of 'more than 1,000' migrants\n\nThe acting director of ICE said during Thursday's briefing that his agency is administering DNA tests to asylum seekers and other immigrants 'to ferret out the false families' taking advantage of rules governing the detention of children.\n\nMatthew Albence said the DNA tests have assisted in the prosecution of 'more than 1,000' migrants claiming to be 'fraudulent families or imposters' so that they can be released into the United States.\n\nAlbence claimed they are identifying 'loopholes' a court settlement prohibiting the detention of children for more than 20 days by the federal government.\n\n'So, we're utilizing DNA sampling right now in the border environment, trying to ferret out the false families,' he said, claiming it 'has led to significant numbers of children being recycled and victimized' by unrelated adults.\n\nHe said, 'That's what the DNA sampling goes after. We're hitting about a 15 percent rate of individuals or families presenting as families that really aren't families. And we're prosecuting those cases.'\n\nAlbence also stated that young adults are posing as unaccompanied teens to skirt the laws and it's posing a danger to children who are lawfully in the shelters.\n\n'That is an unsafe environment for those children if you're putting adults in there,' he said during a briefing at the podium.\n\nTexas sheriff's White House comments about criminal aliens 'In Tarrant County, Texas, it's the 15th largest county in the nation, this morning we had 4,200 inmates. Out of that, 7 per cent were illegal aliens. And they were being held for such offense as murder, sexual assault of children -- there were about 70 of them. And there were robbers in there, and kidnappers, and people who committed arson, and people who were DWI [offenders]. And out of that, you know, you think about that, if we returned them, with this radical ruling out of California where you have a federal judge making law for the nation, or attempting to, it will put our communities in jeopardy. Of those people that we have in custody, we know for a fact that 72 per cent of them are repeat offenders. So if we have to turn them loose, or they get released, they're coming back to your neighborhood and my neighborhood. These drunks will run over your children, and they will run over my children. And if that happens, I know that you will want, and I would want for you, the full force of the law. And immigration is part of that full force.' \u2013 Tarrant County, Texas Sheriff Bill Waybourn\n\nAlbence called the September ruling an example of 'judicial overreach' that threatened public safety.\n\nICE cross-checks jail rosters around the U.S. with federal databases that track people's nationality and immigration status.\n\nWhen it detects that a person is unauthorized to be in the U.S., ICE will issue a detainer asking the agency to hold the person until he or she can be taken into immigration custody.\n\nAdvocates allege relying on electronic databases alone to issue detainers is unreliable because they often have erroneous data and can lead to falsely accusing people of being in the U.S. illegally.\n\nCiting ICE's data, Birotte wrote that 42 detainers between May 2015 and February 2016 were explicitly lifted because the person was a citizen. Nearly 800 detainers out of almost 13,000 issued during that time were withdrawn because the person was a citizen 'or otherwise not subject to removal,' the judge wrote.\n\nAsked about the detention of Americans, Albence said he could not speak about ongoing litigation.\n\n'Many times, individuals that we come across that are United States citizens don't even know that they are because the laws around citizenship are so complicated,' he said.\n\nJennie Pasquarella, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which helped bring the lawsuit, said the ruling was 'critical to protecting the rights of everyone' and ensuring that ICE does not subject people to baseless arrests and detention.\n\nU.S. immigration agencies earlier this year detained an American-born 18-year-old for more than three weeks even though he had copies of paperwork documenting his citizenship.\n\nA Democratic congresswoman from California visiting a Border Patrol processing center in South Texas in July encountered a 13-year-old girl holding a U.S. passport next to her mother, who had been accused of crossing the border illegally.\n\nAlbence spoke next to local sheriffs from around the U.S. who are cooperating with ICE. As the agency has faced resistance to its operations in some parts of the country, the Trump administration has held several White House events featuring local officials who support its immigration priorities.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Director Matt Albence speaks in the Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019\n\nSheriff Waybourn acknowledged that 'many of these migrants come across that river, down there in Texas, looking for a better day, for something better for their family. And I don\u2019t think anybody disagrees with that.'\n\n'But the problem is, the very people that they were fleeing, who preyed upon them, came with them. And that's who we're trying to initially eliminate out of our country.'\n\nPasquarella said Waybourn's statement was 'fueled by xenophobia and racism.'\n\n'They're applying this narrative they would never apply to citizens just because they're not citizens,' she said.\n\nAt the White House, Waybourn also said that the narrative against law enforcement officers is similar to the one that was 'used against our Vietnam returning soldiers' and critics should run for office if they want to see a rule change.\n\n'They're eviscerating honorable people doing noble things, standing on the wall between good and evil for you and me. And if these people want to change things, Capitol Hill is down the street,' he said.", "description": "Sergei Waybourn (right), whose record includes trespassing and assault, is the son of Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn, who has warned against illegal aliens who are repeat offenders.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com", "David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19668156-0-image-a-2_1571003841738.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
