Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.) during introductions before Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate started. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nHere\u2019s a breezy minute-by-minute guide to standout moments from the marathon faceoff between the 10 leading Democrats.\n\n0 minutes: Debate night in America starts with cliches, a rapid-fire ABC News montage of prerecorded voices from 10 Democratic candidates. \u201cI will be president for every American,\u201d says former vice president Joe Biden. \u201cThis is our moment,\u201d asserts Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \u201cWe will make the most of this moment,\u201d declares former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. It goes on, indistinguishable from what candidates always say at times like this.\n\n1 minute: The stage on the campus of Texas Southern University in Houston is revealed to be massive, electronic and blue, like a deep-sea Times Square. The people are also blue. Blue ties. Blue suits. Blue shirts. Democrats have been sad for the past three years, so this feels appropriate. Warren, center stage, stands out in a magenta jacket. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, keeping close to her moderate brand, has taken a small risk with a dark turquoise coat.\n\n2 minutes: ABC\u2019s four debate hosts introduce themselves by making clear that this is not CNN. There will be no 15-second gut punches or rejoinders like in the July debates. Candidates get 75 seconds to answer, 45 seconds to respond.\n\n3 minutes: To prove the point, everyone gets extended time for an opening statement. Former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro goes first, declaring that he can excite a \u201cyoung, diverse coalition\u201d like John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did. Klobuchar follows by saying she is neither loud nor made for TV. \u201cWe have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show,\u201d she says of President Trump. \u201cI think we need something different.\u201d\n\n[Democrats clash over health care and more in debate that started with calls for unity]\n\n6 minutes: O\u2019Rourke says the shooter who murdered 22 last month in his hometown of El Paso was \u201cinspired to kill by our president.\u201d Then he bemoans the political debate that followed: \u201cThe bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of mole hills \u2014 we have to be bigger,\u201d he says. This is the clearest rationale for his campaign that he has so far offered in a debate.\n\n\n\nAndrew Yang during Thursday\u2019s presidential debate in Houston. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\n7 minutes: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker follows with a bit of his stump speech, strung together with aphorisms. \u201cWithout vision, the people will perish,\u201d he says. \u201cAt our best, we unify.\u201d He is followed by businessman Andrew Yang, who immediately takes Klobuchar up on her game-show challenge. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something unprecedented tonight,\u201d he says, like Howie Mandel about to open a briefcase. \u201cMy campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.\u201d It\u2019s a gimmick designed to promote the core idea of Yang\u2019s candidacy \u2014 his plan for the government to pay Americans a universal basic income.\n\n10 minutes: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is stunned to momentary silence. He has no $12,000 voter prizes to offer. \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d he says, before launching a lyrical opening statement that is basically typical presidential campaign words, arranged better. \u201cImagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people,\u201d he says.\n\n11 minutes: California Sen. Kamala D. Harris has planned a novel rhetorical device. She looks in the camera and tells Trump she knows he is watching. He is not, in fact, watching. At this moment, he is addressing Republican lawmakers in Baltimore. But that is beside the point. The former prosecutor wants to show she can, in the words of her advisers, \u201cprosecute the case.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s what you don\u2019t get,\u201d she tells the man who can\u2019t hear her. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t get is that the American people are so much better than this.\u201d\n\n13 minutes: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s voice sounds like gravel. When he speaks louder, it builds into a growl, then a roar. \u201cWe have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country,\u201d he says. Sanders has almost no pretense. What you see \u2014 the wily hair, the red face, the ideological certainty \u2014 is exactly who he is.\n\n[Biden delivers the debate performance he needed, despite occasional missteps]\n\n14 minutes: The opening statements round out with Warren, the former Harvard professor, recounting her blue-collar roots, from an Oklahoma childhood to the part-time waitress job to single motherhood. \u201cI know what\u2019s broken. I know how to fix it,\u201d she says. Biden uses his time to rebut all the claims by his rivals that he lacks bold ideas or a sense of urgency. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer time to postpone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should get moving.\u201d\n\n17 minutes: The first question is about health care. Biden gets asked if Sanders and Warren are going too far with their plan to effectively replace private health insurance and the Obamacare exchanges with a government-run Medicare-for-all. He answers by attacking Warren, who has said she is with Sanders on this issue. \u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d Then he points out that neither Warren nor Sanders have explained how they will pay for their plans. He has come to rumble.\n\n18 minutes: Warren is smiling. She defuses the Obama comparison by praising the former president\u2019s health reforms and decides not to bite back. Instead she says under Medicare-for-all, the rich will pay more and the middle class will pay less.\n\n19 minutes: ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos decides to repeat a question that Warren has spent more than six months refusing to answer directly, even though experts have said the answer is yes. Will her health plan raise taxes on the middle class? She says again that in terms of overall costs, the wealthy will pay more and the middle class will pay less.\n\n22 minutes: Biden, seeming gleeful in his new role on offense, is happy to say what Warren will not. \u201cThis is about candor, honesty, big ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe middle-class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they\u2019re going to end up paying $5,000 more.\u201d\n\n[Winners and losers from the third Democratic debate]\n\n23 minutes: So it goes, back and forth. Sanders and Warren won\u2019t admit to the new taxes, focusing instead on the profits taken by private insurers and the possibility of greater cost savings by avoiding them. Sanders points out that U.S. health costs are twice what Canadians pay. \u201cThis is America,\u201d Biden snaps back. \u201cYes, but Americans don\u2019t want to pay twice as much as other countries,\u201d says Sanders.\n\n\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) offered a retort about Medicare-for-all during the debate. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\n25 minutes: Klobuchar, Buttigieg and Harris all chime in with different approaches to backing up Biden\u2019s view that private insurance should remain an option. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar says. \u201cI trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway,\u201d says Buttigieg. The name he has for his proposal \u2014 \u201cMedicare-for-all who want it \u2014 just happens to be two syllables short of iambic pentameter. Harris says her plan is \u201cabout offering people choice, not taking that from them.\u201d\n\n31 minutes: Biden is still not done. He asks for 15 seconds to respond, forgetting that this is not CNN. He gets it, and attacks Sanders for the benefits some union workers would lose under Medicare-for-all. Sanders responds by asking for 1 minute, even though he should only get 45 seconds. He says people are going bankrupt in America just for getting sick with cancer. Biden retorts by saying that those with serious illness that brings them into poverty would be \u201cautomatically enrolled\u201d in his public-option plan.\n\n33 minutes: Then Castro takes it all to another level. His plan would basically mimic Sanders\u2019s Medicare-for-all but still allow people to opt out and remain in private insurance. \u201cThe differences between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in,\u201d he says.\n\n[Juli\u00e1n Castro questioned Joe Biden\u2019s acuity. But did Castro get it right?]\n\n35 minutes: Biden objects to this, since his plan does have an automatic enrollment for those near the poverty line who can\u2019t afford private insurance. Minutes earlier, he had mentioned this, while also saying someone who loses a job could buy into the plan. \u201cYou are automatically enrolled,\u201d he said, referring to the poorer voter.\n\n36 minutes: Castro sees a chance to make his generational case, but to do it he conflates the two circumstances and appears to go after Biden\u2019s age. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in,\u201d Castro says, without allowing Biden a chance to respond. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d Biden seems to get what\u2019s going on and mimes exasperation, then a smile.\n\n37 minutes: \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not,\u201d says Castro, sounding a bit like he has left the debate stage and joined the schoolyard. Biden responds immediately: \u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him.\u201d\n\n38 minutes: \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other,\u201d Buttigieg says accurately. Castro responds by showing he can lecture younger rivals as well. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete,\u201d Castro says.\n\n[Which candidates attacked the most during the third Democratic debate?]\n\n39 minutes: Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, breaks the tension by making one of his Asian jokes. \u201cNow, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors,\u201d he says.\n\n40 minutes: The health-care portion of the night ends, with a quick pivot to race. The candidates are each asked to prove their ability to handle racial division and injustice. O\u2019Rourke gets applause for mentioning \u201cAugust 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will and in bondage.\u201d Castro lists off the names of black people who have been killed by police in recent years. Booker promises to make a new White House office to combat white supremacy. Buttigieg speaks about \u201ctranscending the framework\u201d that \u201cpits a single black mother of three against a displaced autoworker.\u201d\n\n46 minutes: Harris gets a tough question about why she didn\u2019t accomplish more as a prosecutor in reforming the criminal justice system. She is ready for the question, rattles off her accomplishments, and then admits that there was much more to do when she became a U.S. senator. \u201cAs president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete,\u201d she says.\n\n49 minutes: Klobuchar, who has been criticized along similar lines for her record as a prosecutor, gets the same question and answers it much the same way.\n\n[Fact-checking the third Democratic presidential debate]\n\n51 minutes: Biden gets the criminal justice reform question and appears to stumble. \u201cNobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime,\u201d he says. He probably means for nonviolent drug offenses, or something like that. Or he is making big news about a new criminal justice reform idea embraced by moderates in the Democratic Party.\n\n55 minutes: The candidates now debate gun policy. Several candidates praise O\u2019Rourke for his emotional and forceful response to the El Paso shooting, but they do not agree with him on imposing mandatory gun buyback for assault weapons.\n\n\n\nFormer congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke answers a question during the debate. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\n60 minutes: O\u2019Rourke is grateful for the praise from the other candidates. And unapologetic about his new position on gun confiscation. \u201cSo many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren\u2019t enough ambulances to get to them in time,\u201d he says. \u201c. . . Hell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\n70 minutes: Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos tries repeatedly to get Biden to back away from the deportation policy under the Obama presidency. Like Warren and Sanders, who would not admit to new taxes, Biden refuses to bite. \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\u201d he says.\n\n72 minutes: Castro once again attacks Biden. Just as before, Castro\u2019s eagerness seems to work against him. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work, but not have to answer to any questions,\u201d Castro says. Then when the moderator asks Biden to respond, Castro keeps talking.\n\n73 minutes: \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent,\u201d says Biden, once he finally gets a chance to speak.\n\n74 minutes: Warren, Buttigieg, Yang and O\u2019Rourke all get more immigration questions, and all of them denounce Trump and promise to do better for the country.\n\n82 minutes: The first commercial break. Running for president, after all, is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n88 minutes: And we\u2019re back. The topic now is Trump\u2019s tariffs. The candidates are all hazy, promising to have similar aims of getting tough on China with less-harmful methods. But none of them say they would abandon tariffs completely. Some, like Castro, stick to abstract phrases like \u201cratchet down the trade war.\u201d Others, like Warren, seem eager for a further escalation in defense of the American worker. \u201cYou want to come sell goods to American consumers? Then you got to raise your standards,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can use trade to help build a stronger economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nSen. Kamala Harris laughs during an exchange with one of the debate moderators. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n96 minutes: Harris uses the trade question to uncork a manliness shot on Trump, returning to her prosecute the case theme. \u201cDonald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 you know, when you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude,\u201d she says. Then she laughs at her own joke.\n\n97 minutes: Stephanopoulos, who is not a very big dude, doesn\u2019t know what to do with this. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to take the bait, Senator Harris,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, George, it wasn\u2019t about you,\u201d says Harris. That got awkward.\n\n98 minutes: Sanders points out that Biden voted for NAFTA and other trade deals, which he opposed. Biden responds by hugging Warren\u2019s position. \u201cAt the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists,\u201d he says.\n\n102 minutes: Time to talk about Afghan withdrawal. The candidate positions range from \u201cpull out quickly\u201d to \u201cpull out while leaving a clear counterterrorism force to make sure al-Qaeda or other international terror groups do not start using the country as a staging base again.\u201d But it is not entirely clear who would leave what size force or for how long. Warren seems more dovish than Biden.\n\n111 minutes: The conversation ends when Sanders takes a chance to point out he opposed the Iraq invasion and Biden supported it. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Biden says, appearing to admit his mistake. This moment is quickly swept away when Yang gets a question about his preparations to be commander in chief, and he clearly struggles. \u201cI\u2019ve signed a pledge to end the forever wars,\u201d he says in a rambling answer that includes a mention of \u201cour own country of Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\n114 minutes: Sanders once again refuses to call Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u201ca dictator,\u201d despite a direct question. \u201cA vicious tyrant,\u201d Sanders says instead.\n\n117 minutes: Booker, a vegan, is asked if others should follow his diet. \u201cNo,\u201d Booker says. Then he translates his answers into Spanish. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n118 minutes: This begins the climate-change portion of the evening. There is no real disagreement. Rather, the candidates compete to show concern. Then, Yang proposes that the government give everyone in America 100 \u201cDemocracy dollars,\u201d which they can spend on political causes to reduce the relative influence of corporate donations. This is in addition to $12,000 in sweepstakes-like money he announced earlier in the night for 10 families.\n\n126 minutes: Education is the topic. The candidates agree that Trump is bad. Public schools are good, and public-school teachers are better. The latter deserve a raise.\n\n134 minutes: Biden is asked a question about his old views on school segregation, and he deftly avoids the topic, focusing instead on Maduro, public schools and other things parents can do to help their children learn. \u201cMake sure you have the record player on at night,\u201d he says. \u201cMake sure that kids hear words.\u201d\n\n140 minutes: A final commercial break. Almost there. Debates are often the opposite of a good sporting event in the final quarter. You have to force yourself to keep watching.\n\n146 minutes: We\u2019re back with a softball question that doubles as an opportunity for closing statements. All the candidates are asked to speak about their own resilience. After a brief interruption from protesters shouting for unclear reasons, Biden speaks eloquently about the family tragedy he has endured, including the death of his daughter, first wife and adult son. \u201cYou know, Kierkegaard said, \u2018Faith sees best in the dark,\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\n149 minutes: Warren returns to her stump speech. Sanders talks about his early campaign losses. Harris talks about the challenge of being the \u201cfirst black woman\u201d in many jobs. Booker talks about his early political races in Newark. Klobuchar talks about her alcoholic father and the illness of her daughter after birth. Buttigieg talks about coming out as gay. Yang talks about his business struggles. O\u2019Rourke talks about his hometown. Castro talks about his immigrant family, and his decision to quit his law firm job because of a political conflict.\n\n165 minutes: \u201cThe debate is over,\u201d says Stephanopoulos. See you next month, with even more qualified candidates possibly spread over two nights. Remember, it\u2019s a marathon. Sprints would be too easy.", "description": "Here\u2019s a minute-by-minute guide to standout moments from this marathon faceoff between the 10 leading Democratic presidential candidates.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Qi8V51BeOGv1khnOpFkVZuC3Mvk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KXH3XNWWAYI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
