The easy move would have been to pick one of our savings accounts and transfer the other person's savings over.\n\nHowever, the easy move was definitely not the smartest move. My Fifth Third savings account was making a measly 0.02% in interest, while my husband's PNC savings account was earning 0.01%. We both liked keeping our savings at banks that had physical locations near our house, but we knew the interest rates just weren't cutting it.\n\nWe began to research other savings accounts and eventually decided on transferring our savings into an Ally Bank online savings account, as it offers competitive interest rates that are rarely offered by many large banks and financial institutions. With an Ally online savings account, we'd be able to earn 2.2% in interest (at the time) \u2014 a huge step up from the 0.02% and 0.01% we were used to.\n\nIn addition to its impressive interest rate (note that as of October 3, 2019, this account pays 1.9% in interest), Ally offers a variety of other noteworthy benefits my husband and I love. Unlike other savings accounts, Ally does not have any monthly maintenance fees or balance requirements. Even though there's no brick-and-mortar Ally Bank near my house, I've found that I can get the help I need at any time by taking advantage of the 24/7 online or phone support. I have yet to experience a long hold time or an unhelpful customer-service representative.\n\nMy husband and I are also huge fans of the Ally Bank app. We can check our balance and scheduled transfers, and keep track of our savings from the convenience of our phones. The app also allows us to take pictures of checks to make deposits and transfer money into our checking account (which is also with Ally by the way) with absolutely no issues.\n\nIf we had stayed with either our premarriage savings accounts, $20,000 in savings would have made only $2 to $6 in interest. Now we can enjoy an estimated interest earnings of $440 with our Ally Bank online savings account. Just like most people, we work hard for our money, so there's no reason to have it sit in a savings account that essentially does nothing for us.\n\nEven if you've had the same savings account for years or are unsure about the idea of an online bank, I encourage you to try an Ally Bank online savings account. Just think about what you could do with the extra money you can earn.", "description": "With an Ally online savings account, we'd be able to earn about 2% in interest \u2014 a huge step up from the .02% and .01% we were used to.", "authors": ["Anna Baluch"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cf544f011e2050e6c44e49a?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
