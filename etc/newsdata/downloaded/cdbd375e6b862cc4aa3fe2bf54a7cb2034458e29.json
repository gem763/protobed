(AP) - A Virginia man has been sentenced to eight months in prison for causing a fatal crash while texting and driving.\n\nNews outlets report 58-year-old Samuel Allebaugh pleaded guilty Thursday to involuntary manslaughter as part of a deal that sentenced him to nine years in prison, with all but eight months suspended.\n\nProsecutors say Allebaugh was driving a dump truck in February while texting his girlfriend about what to get her for Valentine\u2019s Day. They say he veered off road and overcorrected, sending his truck directly into Karen E. Giles\u2019 Honda Accord. The 56-year-old Giles, a volunteer rescue squad member, was killed almost instantly.\n\nUpon Allebaugh\u2019s release from prison, the plea deal requires him to perform 125 hours community service for organizations that teach about the dangers of distracted driving.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Virginia man has been sentenced to eight months in prison for causing a fatal crash while texting and driving.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
