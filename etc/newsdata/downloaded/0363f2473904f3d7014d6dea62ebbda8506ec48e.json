The death toll from vapes has reached 34, and hundreds more have faced life-threatening sicknesses.\n\nThis means that, astonishingly, fears over e-cigs have converted vapers such as 20-year-old Delilah Cravens back to cigarettes, even though the risks remain deadly.\n\n\u201cWithin the people I hang out with, there was a point where most of us were Juuling, and now most of us are back to cigarettes,\u201d the Kenyon College junior tells The Post.\n\nWith vapes, it can sometimes seem like potential new risks arise daily, users say. Now, cigarettes are feeling like a less-chaotic evil, especially as people realize how little has been done to study the new devices over the long term. Nielsen reports the long-term decline in cigarette sales was moderated somewhat this September, at the same time as e-cigarettes\u2019 growth rate slowed, Bloomberg reports.\n\n\u201cCigarettes are bad for you, but you\u2019re aware of the extent of the risk you\u2019re imposing on yourself,\u201d says Cravens, who switched from cigarettes to Juul last year, but is now back to smoking.\n\nA Juul spokesperson tells The Post that their devices are designed to help adult smokers switch from combustible cigarettes to an alternative nicotine delivery system. \u201c[They are] not intended to be used as a nicotine cessation product, or for the treatment of nicotine addiction or dependence.\u201d\n\nAnd many believe the rash of recent deaths and illnesses are due not to nicotine e-cigarettes but black market THC vapes, which insiders have previously described to The Post as a \u201ctotally unregulated\u201d industry.\n\nStill, former vaper Caterina Kenworthy was so scared by the vape-related illness epidemic she threw her Juul into a dumpster behind her apartment and switched back to cigs, which she smoked in her early teens.\n\nThe 25-year-old freelance photographer and bartender in Massachusetts shared a video of the dramatic scene on social media.\n\nKenworthy says broadcasting the moment to her friends and followers deepens her resolve not to hit a Juul again.\n\n\u201cSharing moments like that can provide a sense of personal accountability,\u201d she says, adding that she was also growing more concerned about her dependence on e-cigs.\n\nDealers say they\u2019re noticing a shift as well. One THC vape supplier says he may have to look for a different revenue stream.\n\n\u201cThe falloff of the people who used to buy cartridges has gotten to the point I\u2019m considering not even buying more of them,\u201d says a 22-year-old Brooklyn-based dealer who\u2019s been selling marijuana for eight years but couldn\u2019t share his name for fear of legal repercussions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s put a dent in my customer base,\u201d he tells The Post. The change was sudden, he adds, noting the drop-off happened in August and September \u2014 about when vape-related illnesses and deaths began making headlines.\n\nWholesale prices have dropped too, although he blames it partially on increased market saturation. \u201cBack in the day, you got a gram of pure distillate [THC oil] for $20,\u201d he says. But today \u201cyou can buy it wholesale for $8. That would\u2019ve been unheard of two years ago.\u201d\n\nNot every vape user is concerned about their safety \u2014 though they are prepared for the regulatory backlash to get much worse.\n\n\u201cThe vape deaths made me go out and buy a year supply of vape juice because I knew an irrational knee-jerk political reaction was about to hit us,\u201d says Adam Colon, 44.\n\nWhen Gov. Andrew Cuomo banned flavored e-cigarettes last month, \u201cI started to panic,\u201d he tells The Post.\n\nHe went to the vape shop downstairs from his Dumbo office and bought $120 worth of vape juice.\n\n\u201cThat whole week everyone was mass buying,\u201d he says the shop owner told him.\n\nBut, for 24-year-old Clinton Hill resident Hannah Erhart, who quit Juuling for safety reasons and because it was becoming a more expensive habit than smoking, it\u2019s back to smoking breaks in alleyways \u2014 which she claims is a welcome change.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go outside to Juul at a party,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something I missed when I switched to Juuling.\u201d", "description": "Astonishingly, fears over e-cigs have converted vapers back to cigarettes, even though the risks remain deadly.", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/vape-cigarettes-01.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
