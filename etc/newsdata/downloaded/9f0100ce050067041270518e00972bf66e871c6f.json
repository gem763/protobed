Can anyone?", "language": "en", "text": "The combined record of the New England Patriots\u2019 first three opponents is 0-9.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reason to believe the Patriots might not be that good this season, hope that an early soft schedule has inflated New England. It\u2019s still a reach considering the Patriots blew out the Pittsburgh Steelers when they still had Ben Roethlisberger, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s another argument against New England\u2019s dominance right now.\n\nThe Patriots are plus-89 in point differential through three games, an amazing 36 points ahead of anyone else. The defense hasn\u2019t allowed a touchdown in four straight games, going back to last season\u2019s Super Bowl. New England\u2019s offense is tied for fifth in yards gained per game and is second in points per game. The Patriots look like a machine.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThis week, the challenge gets a little tougher than Miami or the Jets. The Buffalo Bills are 3-0, and they host the Patriots on Sunday.\n\nBuffalo also hasn\u2019t played the toughest schedule, but is off to a good start. The defense has a lot of young talent and looks legit. Quarterback Josh Allen continues to make strides. Given the number of winnable games on the Bills\u2019 schedule and their 3-0 start, it looks like they\u2019re set up well to be a wild-card team this season.\n\nOf course, Buffalo likely still has dreams of being a division winner. Realistically, the only way that path opens up is with a win over the Patriots on Sunday. That has been rare. Tom Brady has been a part of 15 wins in Buffalo\u2019s stadium, the most for any quarterback since 2001. That includes all Bills quarterbacks in that stretch.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick a seven-point road favorite over a 3-0 team with a good defense, but I\u2019ll go with the Patriots. Their defense looks like it could be the best in the NFL or close, and I\u2019m not sure the Bills can avoid making big mistakes against it. And if the Patriots cruise by the 3-0 Bills in Buffalo, what hope does anyone (other than maybe the Chiefs) have?\n\nNew England Patriots wide receiver Phillip Dorsett (13) scores a touchdown against the Jets. (Getty Images)\n\nHere are the against-the-spread picks for Week 4 of the NFL season:\n\nSUPERCONTEST\n\nFalcons (-4) over Titans: Maybe the Falcons will be one of those teams that are better at home. They did look better in the second half against the Colts, though they still lost. The Titans haven\u2019t looked good since Week 1.\n\nRaiders (+6.5) over Colts: The Raiders are in the middle of an impossibly tough stretch of games away from home, and that\u2019s a concern. But the Colts have some key injuries, and this could end up being a close game.\n\nDolphins (+16) over Chargers: If you\u2019re in a survivor pool, you either passed the Chargers or didn\u2019t feel good picking them. This is the type of game the Chargers can screw up, right? The history says to just take the Chargers, even if it\u2019s scary: According to Pro Football Reference, 16-point favorites since 1980 (when PFR\u2019s point-spread history starts) are 80-6 straight up. If you bring that down to 15.5 points, which is where the line was in Las Vegas on Friday morning, favorites are 95-6 straight up. If they lose, it\u2019ll be historic. Still, it\u2019s too many points to lay with a team that is known for dumb losses.\n\nBroncos (-3) over Jaguars: I can\u2019t comprehend how the Broncos have no turnovers and no sacks through three weeks. If that doesn\u2019t change this week, something is really wrong. We all love Jaguars rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew, but this is a tough spot for him.\n\nCowboys (-2.5) over Saints: The Saints got a special teams and defensive touchdown to beat the Seahawks last week. I\u2019m not convinced they can produce enough offense with Teddy Bridgewater at quarterback. It\u2019ll be impressive if they can beat a hot Cowboys team without Drew Brees.\n\nAnd here are the rest of the picks ...\n\nEagles (+4) over Packers (picked Thursday): The big story out of this game might end up being Davante Adams\u2019 turf toe injury. If Adams has to miss some time, the Packers\u2019 pass-catching crew doesn\u2019t look too good anymore.\n\nChiefs (-6.5) over Lions: Matt Patricia needs a heck of a game plan this week. The Lions are strangely in first place of the NFC North after the Packers\u2019 loss on Thursday night, but they don\u2019t look much like a first-place team yet. We\u2019ll revisit that if they beat a great Chiefs offense.\n\nGiants (-3) over Redskins: This seems like a bit of a trap. The Giants are knee-deep in Daniel Jones hype. The Redskins looked absolutely awful on Monday night. And now the Giants are only laying a field goal at home? Beware.\n\nBrowns (+7) over Ravens: I\u2019m giving the Browns one last chance. If they can\u2019t at least be competitive in this game, they can pretty much forget about competing for a division title and we should have serious questions about Freddie Kitchens and whether he\u2019ll be a one-and-done coach. It hasn\u2019t looked good for him so far. The Browns\u2019 injury report is also concerning, but at some point Cleveland\u2019s offense has to show up ... right?\n\nPanthers (+4) over Texans: I liked the Panthers before the season and would have bailed on that if I knew Cam Newton was going to miss time. But the Panthers played their best game of the season last week with Kyle Allen. Let\u2019s see where this thing goes.\n\nBuccaneers (+10) over Rams: This could be the game in which the Rams\u2019 offense explodes. But it hasn\u2019t looked great yet. Jared Goff doesn\u2019t look special, though he was paid like he is. We know the Bucs can score, and at very least they can get a backdoor cover.\n\nSeahawks (-5) over Cardinals: Seattle\u2019s loss last week means they won\u2019t sleepwalk into this game. Arizona looked bad last week, and other than a spirited comeback against the Lions in Week 1, they haven\u2019t shown much.\n\nVikings (+2.5) over Bears: In the Kirk Cousins era there has been a clear trend. The Vikings beat bad teams and lose to good teams. I\u2019ll give them a chance here, with their strong defense against Mitchell Trubisky, but I might regret it.\n\nBengals (+4) over Steelers: If you just tracked the Steelers\u2019 score against the 49ers last week, you\u2019d have thought they played well and lost late. The Steelers were actually pretty awful. They forced five turnovers and still lost, which is just about impossible. Maybe Mason Rudolph is better this week, but he wasn\u2019t good last week.\n\nLast week: 8-8\n\nSeason to date: 27-22\n\nSuperContest: 3-2 last week, 8-7 season to date\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
