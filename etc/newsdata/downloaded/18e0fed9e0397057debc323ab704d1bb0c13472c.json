(Justin T. Gellerson/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. federal budget deficit jumped 26% in the 2019 fiscal year to $984 billion, reaching its highest level in seven years as the government was forced to borrow more money to pay for President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending policies, official figures showed Friday.\n\nThe deficit has now swelled nearly 50% since Trump took office, and it is projected to top $1 trillion in 2020. It did not hit $1 trillion in fiscal 2019, which ended Sept. 30, but that was largely the result of Trump\u2019s tariffs on trading partners like China, which brought in more than $70 billion in revenue.\n\nThe grim fiscal scorecard shows how far the Republican Party, under Trump, has strayed from conservative orthodoxy, which long prioritized less spending and lower deficits. After years of railing against federal spending while President Barack Obama was in office, Republicans have largely followed the president\u2019s lead in cutting budget deals with Democrats that have increased overall government spending.\n\nAnnual budget deficits have now increased for four consecutive years, the first such run since the early 1980s. That is a sharp rebuke to Trump, who promised as a presidential candidate to eliminate deficits within eight years by cutting spending and expanding the economy.\n\nInstead, he has allowed deficits to balloon by enacting sweeping tax cuts and increasing government spending. The rising levels of red ink have come despite a period of sustained economic growth, when budget deficits typically fall as households earn more money, corporations make higher profits and fewer people use safety net programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps. The United States entered its longest expansion on record in July, and the jobless rate is at a 50-year low, yet the deficit has continued to widen.\n\nThat could be bad news for Trump, who is heading into a reelection as slowing global growth and festering trade tensions weigh on the U.S. economy and as stimulus from his $1.5 trillion tax cut fades.\n\n\u201cThe current levels of debt are unprecedented in peacetime during a growing economy, and the consequences of this irresponsible spending are unknown,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nThe deficit is growing in large part because tax receipts are falling, as Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts continue to siphon revenue from the Treasury. The numbers reflect the fact that Trump\u2019s most significant legislative achievement is not paying for itself, as Republicans have said it would. In fact, tax revenue for the last two years has fallen more than $400 billion short of what the Congressional Budget Office projected in June 2017, six months before the tax law was passed.\n\nIn the year through September, the pace of government spending has grown twice as fast as that of tax revenue, with higher outlays on Medicare, Social Security and military spending.\n\n\u201cThe biggest factor was the tax cuts, which gave a short-term sugar high but now are just contributing to a larger deficit,\u201d said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, which promotes fiscal responsibility. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an economy that\u2019s going to grow its way out of this problem.\u201d\n\nThe deficit, which is the gap between what the government takes in through taxes and other sources of revenue and what it spends, now sits at 4.6% of gross domestic product, up from 3.8% of GDP in 2018. Tax revenue accounts for just 16.3% of the total economy.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement Friday that the president\u2019s economic agenda was working, pointing to the historically low jobless rate, and called on lawmakers to help the administration cut spending.\n\n\u201cIn order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals \u2014 like the president\u2019s 2020 budget plan \u2014 to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nFears of trillion-dollar deficits could renew the desire of Republicans in Congress to propose cuts to social programs, like food stamps, Social Security and other safety net benefits.\n\nRepublicans have long pointed to swelling deficits as a reason to pursue their long-held vision of smaller government, including undoing many of the programs ushered in during the New Deal and Great Society to help the most disadvantaged Americans.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. federal budget deficit jumped 26% in the 2019 fiscal year to $984 billion, reaching its highest level in seven years as the government was forced to borrow more money to pay for President Donald Trump's tax and spending policies, official figures showed Friday.The deficit has", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cosEHhhtg3GyNz.RrKfAiw--~B/aD0yMTQzO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/c6dfc8610c03dc9e5c266e48309d445b", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
