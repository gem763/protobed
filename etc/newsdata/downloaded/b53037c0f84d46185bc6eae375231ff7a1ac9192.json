Officials said that\u2019s on par with the same time period last year.\n\nEm Stephens, a spokeswoman for Virginia\u2019s health department, said the number of flu cases confirmed in a lab are an undercount of the number of people who contract the flu.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMost people who get it don\u2019t report it or seek care,\u201d she said.\n\nThe District had confirmed two cases of the flu as of Thursday, which is similar to the same time period last year, said John Davies-Cole, an epidemiologist for the D.C. Department of Health.\n\nAD\n\nRobert R. Neall, the secretary of Maryland\u2019s Department of Health, said in a statement that it\u2019s not clear if \u201cflu activity this early indicates a particularly bad season on the horizon.\u201d\n\nNeall said people should \u201cget your flu shot now,\u201d noting that vaccines are frequently available in grocery stores, health clinics or pharmacies. The flu vaccine is recommended for those older than 6 months.\n\nPeople generally catch the flu between October and May. Many jurisdictions encourage the public to get the flu vaccine, which protects against both influenza A and B, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nEven with a flu shot, officials said, it takes about two weeks before the \u201cbody\u2019s full immune response kicks in,\u201d according to Fran Phillips, Maryland\u2019s deputy secretary for public health.\n\nThe flu can pose a serious health risk for children younger than 5 and adults older than 65. Pregnant women and anyone with a compromised immune system also are vulnerable to complications from the flu, according to health experts.\n\nAD", "description": "Health officials are reminding the public to get flu vaccines.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uBDhPEUG4eeXSZ9Fz9LibsXxrqc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PTBZNDFHEBGUDPQLKFQNY2IE54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
