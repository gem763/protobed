He\u2019s betting that the media won\u2019t be able to resist framing this story as \u201cBoth sides have a legitimate argument.\u201d He\u2019s betting that Democrats won\u2019t be willing to engage in as tough a brand of politics as he is.\n\nWhat\u2019s the right response from each of those groups?\n\nFor other Republicans, it\u2019s remembering that they don\u2019t need to submit to Trump. Even though he says the earth is flat, they can say it\u2019s round.\n\nFor the media, it\u2019s using plain-spoken, objective language to state that Trump\u2019s position has no Constitutional basis. The president\u2019s position isn\u2019t supported by federal law.\n\nFor the Democrats, it\u2019s being both tough and smart. File subpoenas and try to persuade judges to force Trump administration officials to testify and hand over documents. If that doesn\u2019t work \u2014 or drags on for weeks \u2014 find other ways to make the case to the country. Don\u2019t allow the impeachment inquiry to be derailed or slowed too badly by Trump\u2019s obstruction.\n\nAnd there is one other group that should be responding to the president\u2019s lawlessness: the public.
