A leftist student said \u201cI hate you and I hope you die\u201d to one of the members of the school\u2019s TPUSA group after being approached about tearing down the displays.\n\nA student at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) told a fellow student that he wants him dead, according to a recent video which shows the aggressor tearing down posters promoting an upcoming TPUSA event featuring the organization\u2019s founder Charlie Kirk and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as guest speakers.\n\nThe vice president of the school\u2019s TPUSA group, Jarrett Torriere, caught the students tearing down the promotional materials on Sunday, and confronted them on video. The incident was later posted to Twitter by Charlie Kirk.\n\nThis is the \"tolerant\" left tearing down @TPUSA posters at @UofNH\u2014where I'll be speaking this week Colleges are becoming breeding grounds for ANTIFA It shouldn't be dangerous to be a conservative on campus Will these students be reprimanded for their behavior? pic.twitter.com/LuLxIMZCd1 \u2014 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cYou guys don\u2019t like our posters?\u201d asked Torriere as he approached the vandals.\n\n\u201cYeah, man, we fucking hate you,\u201d replied one student.\n\n\u201cYeah, we fucking hate it,\u201d added another. \u201cI hate you, and I hope you die.\u201d\n\nThe following day, TPUSA northeast regional manager Taylor Cisinski caught a third student tearing down more of the organization\u2019s promotional posters. The incident was also caught on video and later posted to social media.\n\nWatch below:\n\n\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s okay to take people\u2019s stuff? Can you leave those alone?\u201d said Cisinski in the video, while the student can be seen tearing down TPUSA posters. \u201cWhat do you think this accomplishes?\u201d\n\nThe student did not answer any of Cisinski\u2019s questions, but instead, continued to tear down TPUSA posters as the regional manager attempted to elicit a response.\n\n\u201cDo you have anything to say for yourself?\u201d continued Cisinski. \u201cDoes that make you feel better inside? To rip those up? that\u2019s awfully fascist of you \u2014 you\u2019re like a UNH fascist right here, taking down people\u2019s free speech.\u201d\n\nTPUSA\u2019s \u201cCulture War\u201d event series is hosted on college campuses across the country and feature Kirk, as well as an occasional guest speaker, such as Donald Trump Jr. or Sen. Paul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the past several weeks advertising for the upcoming Culture War event,\u201d Torriere to Breitbart News, \u201cand continuously, we\u2019ve had individuals tearing down our posters. So it only seemed fair for everyone that when they tear down one [poster], we put another two up.\u201d\n\nThe conservative student added that he caught leftist students tearing down TPUSA posters on Sunday, almost immediately after he had put them up.\n\n\u201cWithin minutes, I witnessed two individuals approach the billboard and clearly saw them rip [the posters] down,\u201d said Torriere. \u201cI approached in a fairly calm and respectful way, they on the other hand clearly decided to respond with aggression. I believe that we as Americans can do better.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt bothers me and makes me curious as to what made that individual feel those actions were appropriate,\u201d he added. \u201cOverall, I think it really does say a lot about our society and our current political climate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from a family where my grandfathers and great uncle all served in the Second World War and fought against actual fascism and for our individual rights and freedoms,\u201d said Torriere. \u201cThese types of issues have a special place in my heart and the culture war is a battle I take personally and will continue to fight.\u201d\n\nThe Turning Point USA event featuring Kirk and Sen. Paul is set to be held at UNH on Thursday, October 24.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Students at the University of New Hampshire were caught on video tearing down Turning Point USA posters on Sunday and Monday.
