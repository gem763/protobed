Those who should have been there, but were not. They are fortunate, of course, but such fortune comes at a price. The psychological burden is not easy to handle, and it is bound to stay with them forever. Meet Lourency, the first \u2013 and most probably last \u2013 member of the fateful Chapecoense squad who arrived to European football, having joined the Portuguese club Gil Vicente in the summer.\n\nThe Chapecoense disaster occurred on November 28, 2016, as the team travelled to Colombia in order to face Atletico Nacional in the Copa Sudamericana final. The plane crashed at the outskirts of Medellin, killing 71 of the 77 people on board. Nineteen players and their beloved coach Caio Junior perished.\n\nLourency, a promising 20-year-old winger who had just broken into the senior squad at the time, was supposed to make the trip. \u201cI played a few good games those days and would have taken the journey\u201d, he tells The Independent. \u201cAnd yet, the team had to play a meaningless Brazilian championship fixture against Palmeiras in Sao Paulo first, and the management asked me not to go there, so that I could take part in the state Under-20 tournament because we were fighting for the title.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThat decision had dramatic sequences. \u201cThe squad was expected to come back after the Palmeiras game, and I had to join them on their way to Medellin. However, plans changed unexpectedly. Instead of returning to Chapeco, they decided to go to Colombia directly from Sao Paulo. That is how I was left behind,\u201d Lourency explains.\n\nHad the original schedule been kept, the tragedy would never have happened, but such logical assumptions were not relevant for Lourency when he was informed about the crash. \u201cThose were very dark days. I heard the news at 4am and could hardly believe my ears. I didn\u2019t sleep properly for two weeks after the disaster and thought about my teammates,\u201d the winger remembers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I lost a lot of friends at once. Tiaguinho, Canela, Marcelo Augusto, Josimar, Dener\u2026 they were all close to me. I had a special relationship with Caio Junior too. He was the one who gave me the first chance to play professionally. It is thanks to him that I scored my first goal. I wasn\u2019t supposed to play against Fluminense in September 2016, but eventually he decided to put me on as a substitute, and I scored the late winner. After the final whistle, he told me that he was going to count on me from that moment on,\u201d Lourency says.\n\nTwo months later, the mentor was gone, and the rise was cruelly stopped, just as the striker was finding his feet. It wasn\u2019t a straightforward journey for him in the beginning. \u201cI left my home in northern Brazil at the age of 18 and went south to Rio Grande do Sul to join Internacional. The change was radical, but it was a chance to play for a big club and I couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity. It didn\u2019t work out, though, and Inter weren\u2019t interested in signing me after a year at their youth team. Eventually, I ended up at Chapecoense in 2015, and it was such a positive experience,\u201d the winger recalls.\n\n\u201cI have always supported Flamengo, but immediately loved Chapecoense too. Now I am a fan of both clubs \u2013 my heart belongs to Flamengo, but I am grateful to Chapecoense for everything they did. And then everything just fell apart,\u201d Lourency says.\n\nIn theory, the tragedy might have promised a massive chance for the Chapecoense youngsters who stayed alive to prove themselves, but the reality was exactly the opposite. \u201cThe project was stopped just when I was about to take off. The club was forced to bring in a lot of new players to build a new squad, and they took our places too. The whole atmosphere changed. Psychologically it wasn\u2019t the same at all. They were good players too, so we became irrelevant. I had to leave in order to get playing time.\u201d\n\nHe was loaned out to second division Vila Nova in 2017, then joined Brasil de Pelotas in 2018 \u2013 also in Serie B. \u201cUpon returning to Chapecoense in the beginning of the year, I found out that it was still a bit uncomfortable. Another move was needed. An offer from Sweden came in, but I didn\u2019t want to go. Then Gil Vicente appeared, and that felt right. I see it as an opportunity to restart my career. I have left everything that went wrong behind, and now it\u2019s time to learn in Portugal. It really is a great chance for me,\u201d Lourency says.\n\nIt is perhaps a little easier not to think about the team and friends he is still mourning when he is far away from Chapeco, across the ocean. Almost three years have passed since the tragedy, and those were lost years as far as Lourency\u2019s career is concerned. Now, at the age of 23, he has finally found a coach who believes in him like Caio Junior.\n\nVitor Oliveira, the wily veteran who holds an amazing record of winning promotion from the second division 11 times with different clubs, is famous for his ability to make unproven players better, and the winger immediately felt that. \u201cThe boss is very experienced. He knows how to handle young guys who want to grow, and I just have to make sure that I listen to him as much as possible.\u201d\n\nThe start in August was, therefore, quite remarkable. On his debut, Lourency scored and provided a last minute assist, leading Gil Vicente to a 3-2 win over Aves in the League Cup. Then, just a week later, his name was on everyone\u2019s lips, as he netted and assisted again on his Primeira Liga debut against Porto. The modest club from Barcelos, not far from Braga in northern Portugal, stunned the favourites beating them 2-1, and the new Brazilian was the biggest star of the show.\n\n\u201cI want to have a successful career, win titles, become famous and make history wherever I go,\u201d Lourency says. \u201cMilan are my favourite team because Kaka and many other Brazilians played there, and I like Real Madrid too. Ronaldo was my idol when I grew up. I dream of wearing the yellow shirt of Brazil and playing at the World Cup. Everything is possible.\u201d\n\nCould he go all the way? It is a bit early to make predictions, but the first impression in Portugal is extremely positive. \u201cLourency should have a very good season at Gil Vicente,\u201d Sport TV pundit Ivo Costa says. \u201cBeing coached by Vitor Oliveira is mightily important for him. He will improve tactically and defensively, and shine offensively in the counter-attacking style.\u201d\n\n\u201cLourency is an exciting player,\u201d adds A Bola journalist Nuno Dantas. \u201cHe is fast, a good dribbler and not afraid to take opponents on. He could be one of the most pleasant surprises in Primeira Liga. It is not always easy for a Brazilian to adapt to European football, but he has been influential almost in every game.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are talking about a quick winger who is excellent in one-on-one situations and especially effective when he has space ahead of him, with or without the ball,\u201d Expresso journalist Mariana Cabral agrees.\n\nRemember the name, then. Memories of the Chapecoense disaster won\u2019t leave Lourency, but he seems to have found happiness again, and scouts would be wise to follow his progress closely. The tragic script might be gradually turning into something more positive.", "description": "For every air disaster, there are people who have luckily avoided it.
