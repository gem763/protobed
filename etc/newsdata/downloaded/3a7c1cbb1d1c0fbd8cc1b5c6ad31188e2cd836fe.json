The tale of the two white blood cells, one of which is infected with the virus, depicts the power of love over fear and ignorance.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to tell a story that was relevant to Freddie\u2019s life, but not explicitly about him,\u201d said the directors Esteban Bravo and Beth David in a statement.\n\nTaking a more \u201cmicroscopic\u201d perspective allows for a more nuanced exploration of the struggles those with HIV/AIDS face in their personal relationships and in society, they added.\n\n\u201cThe LGBT+ community fought for years for the right to proper research and healthcare, and because of that fight, millions of lives have been saved. We wanted to celebrate that victory,\u201d Bravo and David said.\n\nThe video is also meant as a tribute to the work of the Mercury Phoenix Trust, set up after Mercury\u2019s death to help support projects worldwide in the fight against HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe song \u201cLove Me Like There\u2019s No Tomorrow\u201d comes from \u201cNever Boring\u201d, the definitive Freddie Mercury solo collection, which will be released worldwide on Oct. 11 through UMG, Hollywood Records and Mercury Records.", "description": "A new video animation featuring two white blood cells in love was released on Thursday to mark what would have been Freddie Mercury's 73rd birthday and help raise awareness of the continued global fight against AIDS.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426443158&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840HP", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
