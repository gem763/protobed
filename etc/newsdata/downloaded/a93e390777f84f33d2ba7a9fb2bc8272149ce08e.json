The company's most recent financial report filed with corporate regulator ASIC, for the year to June 2018, reported a 5.4 per cent increase in the number of its investment units to 8255 from 7828 a year earlier.\n\nThe report also showed a drop in Meriton's operating profit after tax for the 2018 year from $384.3 million to $340.4 million.\n\nMr Triguboff, who has been a critic of state and local authorities' planning processes, said he was building as fast as councils would approve his plans.\n\n\"As soon as they approve, I build,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very difficult to get approvals.\"\n\nHowever, he said some councils in Sydney had softened their resistance to projects and had become more willing to approve applications in a softer development market. This was part of what drove Meriton's increase in dwelling commencements last year, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPlanning departments in councils have become more accommodating, which has allowed us to get projects under way more quickly,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe helpful attitude of planners means we can buy sites confident that we are not going to be bogged down for two or three years by the approvals process and all the while meeting holding costs.\"\n\nMr Triguboff also said this week's quarter-point rate cut needed to be repeated.\n\n\"If it is one-quarter and it\u2019s followed by another one-quarter and another one-quarter, then it changes [things],\" he said. \"On its own, it\u2019s not doing much. I would like them to cut more.\"", "description": "Rich Lister and developer says local councils are being more accommodating in a weaker market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2522%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_18%2C$y_304/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7a402a008dd0bd179013b88592743561020534f8", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
