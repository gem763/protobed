But as far as real negotiations, grading the president\u2019s performance as \u201cextremely good\u201d would require a serious curve. In North Korea, despite his \u201cspecial bond\u201d with dictator Kim Jong-un, there has been no real progress on a denuclearization deal, and Pyongyang is still dabbling in short-range-missile tests. In negotiations with Iran, Trump abandoned his predecessor\u2019s deal and flirts with open conflict on a monthly basis \u2014 though he is still reportedly open to a $15 billion payment to entice Tehran to comply with the nuclear parameters of the 2015 agreement he unilaterally bailed on. And the advertised Israeli-Palestine \u201cdeal of the century\u201d from Jared Kushner is so detached from reality that even GOP allies have urged the administration to scrap it.\n\nDespite this underwhelming report card, Trump has continually pushed for the high humanitarian honor. In February, the White House \u201cinformally\u201d requested that Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, and in April, Trump allies began repeating the narrative that Trump should be a shoo-in for the award. By May, he had internalized that he was a statesman worthy of the prize \u2014 despite celebrating violence against journalists and inciting violence against sitting members of Congress:\n\nDoes Pres. Trump deserve the Nobel Prize? \"Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,\" Pres. Trump says.\n\n\n\n\"The prize I want is victory for the world.\" https://t.co/CFdzczE0fE pic.twitter.com/uqMlsth1UY \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 9, 2018\n\nLike so many of the president\u2019s actions \u2014 rescinding the Clean Power Plan, leaving the Paris climate agreement, ditching the Iran deal \u2014 Trump\u2019s need for international humanitarian recognition is driven by the legacy of his predecessor. \u201cThey gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency,\u201d Trump told reporters on Monday, referring to the largely symbolic and not-exactly-prescient Nobel Peace Prize given to 44 less than nine months into his term. \u201cHe had no idea why he got it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what?
