(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nFor years now, there\u2019s been a primary suspicion that CNN and Jake Tapper (who led the reporting on it) were tipped off about the Steele Dossier and a briefing to Donald Trump on it by James Clapper, who was still technically part of the Obama Administration at the time.\n\nThis all went down in January of 2017, when Tapper suddenly started reporting on details of the dossier and how the newly elected President had been told about it. The CNN newsman would later express his anger that Buzzfeed published the dossier, which showed it to be a farce in short order. Though he claims his objections were based on the unverified nature of the dossier, that doesn\u2019t make sense. Why would CNN not want to the entire dossier published but at the same time be leaking parts of it if they felt it wasn\u2019t proper to publish? The more obvious explanation is that CNN and Tapper really wanted to keep leaking damaging details of the dossier without its ridiculous nature being exposed. It was only after Buzzfeed printed it that it was able to be essentially debunked.\n\nThe question of who gave Tapper that information to begin with arose in a recent Epoch Times article, which was tweeted about on Twitter. This led Tapper to jump in with all his partisan glory and call them liars \u201ccarrying water\u201d for those in power.\n\nNo he hadn\u2019t. That\u2019s a lie. I never spoke to him or communicated with him in any way until I interviewed him on air in May 2017. I get that your publication carries water for people in power, but try sticking to facts and doing basic research. \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 2, 2019\n\nThe Epoch Times responded by pointing out that their source was a House Intel Committee report, not just some anonymous claims or supposition.\n\nDear Mr. Tapper, thank you for reaching out. We cite the House Intelligence Committee's Report on Russian Active Measures, which cites then-DNI James Clapper as saying he talked with you about the Steele dossier.

We will include your statement in our article. \u2014 The Epoch Times (@EpochTimes) September 3, 2019\n\nYou can go read the entire article Tapper links. It doesn\u2019t actually debunk anything and perhaps bolsters the assertion that Clapper was the leak to CNN. The author does his level best to muddy the waters, but in noway does he show the House Intel report to be \u201cinaccurate\u201d as Tapper claims. That article\u2019s claim also contradicts the direct testimony of James Clapper.\n\nThe literal transcript. It isn't the House Report which is the issue. pic.twitter.com/UyXNZWcJZp \u2014 Matt Hay (@MattAHay) September 3, 2019\n\nIn fact, to provide even more context, Clapper had originally told Congress he didn\u2019t discuss the dossier with any journalist at all. He\u2019d later changed his story when confronted with the discussion with Tapper in Jan. of 2017. This is mirrored by the classified ICA report. There would have been no reason to change his story if the only interaction was an already public interview.\n\nThe former DNI later changed his story after he was confronted specifically about his communications with Jake Tapper of CNN. \u201cClapper subsequently acknowledged discussing the \u2018dossier with CNN journalist Jake Tapper,\u2019 and admitted that he might have spoken with other journalists about the same topic,\u201d the report continued. \u201cClapper\u2019s discussion with Tapper took place in early January 2017, around the time IC leaders briefed President Obama and President-elect Trump, on \u2018the Christopher Steele information,\u2019 a two-page summary of which was \u2018enclosed in\u2019 the highly-classified version of the ICA,\u201d or intelligence community assessment.\n\nClapper is also on record telling then President-Elect Trump during the infamous briefing on the Steele matter that CNN had the dossier and was looking for a news hook. 24 hours later, Tapper was handed his hook via a leak.\n\nThere are two explanations here. Either James Clapper lied to Congress or Jake Tapper is lying. Clapper mentions that he discussed it with Tapper after it \u201cwas out in the media.\u201d The dossier was leaked to the media back in late 2016 and Clapper admits that CNN had the dossier in their possession prior to the briefing with Trump. Tapper wouldn\u2019t speak to Clapper officially until an interview in May of 2017. It\u2019s improbable that Clapper was citing that interview over half a year later in his testimony as his discussion with Tapper on the dossier, and if he was, he would have said that.\n\nSecondly, Tapper was reporting on details about the dossier and the briefing to Trump in Jan. of 2017 under the guise of anonymous sources from within the government. CNN, whether Tapper wants to admit it or not, did receive leaks from government officials well before May 2017 and were told of the briefing. Further, it just so happened that after those leaks took place, James Clapper was hired on as a paid analyst by CNN. We are supposed to believe this was all just a coincidence?\n\nTapper is sniping at The Epoch Times and throwing around personal insults with his typical haughty nature, but it\u2019s his story that makes the least sense in all this. If Clapper wasn\u2019t his source, then who was it? Who was feeding Tapper stories about the dossier in Jan. of 2017 and who told them about the briefing to Trump?\n\nHe can clear all that up immediately if he\u2019d like. What he doesn\u2019t get to do is hand wave away a House Intel report and Congressional testimony while demanding we trust his word. CNN simply doesn\u2019t hold that kind of credibility. Not even close.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
