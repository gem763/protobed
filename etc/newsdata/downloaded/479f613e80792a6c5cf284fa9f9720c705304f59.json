Except for the part where Trump talked about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. That was inappropriate.\n\nBut what\u2019s even more inappropriate is the hysterical, hyperbolic, hypocritical, fabricated (I\u2019m talking to you, Katy Tur) impeachment-seeking reaction to the call.\n\nIn football terms, President Trump deserved a five-yard penalty flag. What he did was the equivalent of a false start.\n\nHOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nTrump was wrong to request that Zelensky work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to find out what happened when then-Vice President Biden successfully pressured an earlier Ukrainian president to fire a prosecutor who was looking into misconduct by a company called Burisma Holdings. Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter joined the Ukrainian company\u2019s board in 2014, when his father was serving as vice president.\n\nPresidents and candidates should not call on foreign governments to investigate matters that involve their political opponents. Even if the accusation has merit, presidents and candidates inherently make the issue political when they call on other nations to intervene.\n\nRepublicans need to wise up. The overreacting Democrats and their media backers are the real threat to civility, norms and fairness.\n\nJustice should be blind. No one\u2019s fingers should be on the scales of justice, especially when the fingers belongs to the president or other powerful elected officials.\n\nBut to Trump\u2019s critics \u2013 meaning elected Democrats and much of the media \u2013 Trump was headhunting, and they want to throw him out of the game via impeachment. They always have.\n\nThis is grossly disproportionate and highly hypocritical.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics don\u2019t want to face the fact that Joe Biden \u2013 currently a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the Ukrainian president fired a prosecutor Biden didn\u2019t like.\n\nHow many times has the video of Biden\u2019s threat been played on CNN or MSNBC?\n\nThe former vice president has a Hunter Biden-sized conflict of interest in this matter and his threat of withholding U.S. loan guarantees makes things worse. But Trump\u2019s critics and much of the media don\u2019t care.\n\nTo them, it\u2019s OK when Biden does it. It\u2019s not OK if Trump does.\n\nIn addition, three Democratic U.S. senators used their positions of power to pressure Ukrainian officials to do their bidding regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of President Trump.\n\nSens. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Patrick Leahy of Vermont wrote a letter pressuring Ukrainian officials to work with Mueller to investigate Trump.\n\nSo here again we have a double standard. Democrats want us to believe it\u2019s OK when Democratic senators call on Ukrainians to investigate their rival, but it\u2019s not OK if Trump does.\n\nWhen it comes to working with foreign nations to influence an election, former President Barack Obama\u2019s request to then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev takes the cake.\n\nObama, not wanting his national security positions to become a reelection issue, was caught on camera in 2012 asking Medvedev to tell then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that Obama needed \u201cspace\u201d on missile defense negotiations until after U.S. presidential election was over.\n\nIn other words, Obama was saying: if you, Vladimir, don\u2019t raise this matter during the election, I\u2019ll have more \u201cflexibility\u201d after the election to reach an accommodation.\n\nToo bad Obama said it on camera. If a whistleblower heard him say it, the case against Obama might have been packaged better.\n\nEven by Washington\u2019s typical standards, the Democratic-media hypocrisy toward Trump is over the top. So too is impeachment.\n\nMany Democrats and their echo chamber in the media have wanted to impeach the Trump even before he took office.\n\nAt first, several liberal groups sought to change the outcome of the 2016 election in the Electoral College, but the margin of Trump\u2019s victory was too big for them to succeed. More than 60 elected Democrats boycotted his Inauguration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs offensive and norm-breaking as Trump can be, it is more norm-breaking and offensive to refuse to accept an election result and instead seek to turn all forms of political disagreement into a constitutional crisis in which the Congress tries repeatedly to remove the president from office, negating the results of an election.\n\nRepublicans need to wise up. The overreacting Democrats and their media backers are the real threat to civility, norms and fairness.\n\nImpeachment is not a game. It\u2019s the Constitution\u2019s safety valve and it should only be applied in the gravest of threats to our nation and system of government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAsking a foreign nation to get involved in an American campaign matter is wrong. It was wrong when Trump did it. It was wrong when Obama did it. It was wrong when Biden did it. It was wrong when Hillary Clinton, through the Steele dossier, did it.\n\nBut Republicans of all stripes need to recognize the threat to national unity and cohesion does not come from Trump\u2019s request to Zelensky \u2013 it comes from the refusal of Democrats to let the American people decide who our president should be.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM ARI FLEISCHER", "description": "Trump was wrong to discuss Joe Biden and his son with the president of Ukraine.
