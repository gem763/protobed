Buck had previously been charged in Moore\u2019s death after his arrest last month.\n\nBuck, 65, who is white and has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic causes, preyed on vulnerable men, most of them black, some of them homeless and addicted to drugs, and pressured them to let him inject them with drugs as part of a sexual ritual, prosecutors said.\n\nA defense lawyer has previously said Buck, 65, denies a role in both deaths.\n\nIn addition to including a charge for Dean\u2019s death, the indictment adds charges that Buck provided meth to three other men, including one who said Buck threatened him with a power saw in December if he didn\u2019t leave his apartment and another who overdosed twice in a week last month before escaping the home to get help.\n\nThat last victim\u2019s harrowing account led to Buck\u2019s arrest \u2014 more than two years after activists began staging rallies outside his rent-controlled apartment and pressuring the local district attorney to bring charges in the July 27, 2017 death of Moore, 26.\n\nMoore\u2019s mother and her supporters have said Buck got favorable treatment because of his status and reputation and that the victims were ignored because they were gay black men, drug users and often sex workers. The activists had repeatedly warned that if Buck wasn\u2019t stopped, others would die.\n\nFive months after Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey declined to bring charges in Moore\u2019s death, Dean, 55, was found dead Jan. 7 on the floor of Buck\u2019s living room \u2014 the same place Moore died.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
