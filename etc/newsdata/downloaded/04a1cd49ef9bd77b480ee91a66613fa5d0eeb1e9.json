Kurdish authorities insisted that they would maintain their political autonomy and that the deal was focused solely on military issues.\n\nSyrian regime forces are pictured as they patrol a street on the western entrance of the town of Tal Tamr in the countryside of Syria's northeastern Hasakeh province on October 14, 2019 Credit: AFP More\n\nBut other reports suggested that the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Western-backed Kurdish units who led the fight against Isil, would be folded into Assad\u2019s army and that northeast Syria would come back under direct rule from Damascus.", "description": "Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces swept into cities across northeast Syria for the first time in seven years on Monday after the West\u2019s former Kurdish allies agreed to a Russian-brokered deal to try to hold off a Turkish attack.\u00a0 The Syrian regime\u2019s black-and-red flag went up across the region as Russia seized", "authors": ["Raf Sanchez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yANVGac7FRufrU3UGaCJig--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/c1f1cfc58fc49c597beb41daf96b7232", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
