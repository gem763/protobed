Poland holds parliamentary elections on Sunday. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 There is a lot Izabela Godlewska does not like about Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party. Its talk of tightening already draconian abortion laws and restricting in vitro fertilization make her uncomfortable, as does the country\u2019s creeping autocracy.\n\nBut there are upsides. \u201cThey give money away left and right,\u201d she explained.\n\nFor her two boys \u2014 both blond and blue-eyed, and, on a market outing this week, bundled up in matching blue coats and hats \u2014 she receives a monthly government stipend of 1000 zloty, or $255.\n\nThat is no trifling amount in a country where the average wage is about $900 a month. Law and Justice has also boosted pensions and promised to nearly double the minimum wage.\n\nWhen Poland holds elections on Sunday, the populist party is expected to come out on top once again. It is polling at between 40 and 45 percent of the vote, comfortably the largest party and up from the 38 percent it won in 2015.\n\nLaw and Justice has built a loyal following in this conservative Catholic-majority country, tapping into anti-establishment and anti-immigration sentiment, promoting \u201cfamily values\u201d and demonizing the LGBT community.\n\n[Polish towns advocate \u2018LGBT-free\u2019 zones while the ruling party cheers them on]\n\nBut analysts say the wildly popular payouts have helped the party win support beyond its base and created a sense that people\u2019s monthly incomes are tied to the ruling party\u2019s continuation in power.\n\nGenerous welfare benefits are common across Europe, but they do not usually represent such a large proportion of income, and they are not typically seen as dependent on a particular political party.\n\n\n\nDuring the National Rosary March in Warsaw last weekend, people pray and try to appease God for what they call the desecrations and insults of gay pride parades.

They see the scandals and the propaganda, but feel it is their only choice financially.\u201d\n\nIn a study of voting preferences ahead of the elections, Sierakowski and University of Warsaw sociologist Przemyslaw Sadura found that social welfare was the main factor driving new voters to Law and Justice.\n\n\u201cLaw and Justice did something that rarely happens in Poland: They kept promises,\u201d Sadura said.\n\nThe \u201c500 plus\u201d program \u2014 giving families 500 zloty monthly for each child \u2014 was a 2015 campaign promise. Initially, it applied only to second-born and subsequent children. But in the past month it was extended to firstborn children, as well. Families received a bumper three-month payout \u2014 just ahead of the election \u2014 sparking accusations of vote buying from the opposition.\n\nThe main opposition party, the Civic Coalition, initially criticized the government for draining the budget and diverting cash from badly needed infrastructure projects. But now, realizing the popularity of the handouts, the Civic Coalition is promising to add more.\n\n\n\nPictures of leading Polish politicians rest on wheelbarrows at a political protest camp near the Polish parliament building in Warsaw. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nThe opposition, though, is weak and lacks trust among voters \u2014 a testament to the success of Law and Justice, said Lukasz Pawlowski, managing editor of the Kultura Liberna liberal online weekly.\n\nThe center-right Civic Coalition is polling at around 26 to 28 percent \u2014 up from 24 percent in the last vote. The left-wing Lewica is expected to become the third largest party, overtaking Kukiz, a right-wing political movement headed by a former punk rock musician.\n\nFor the past four years, the main opposition message has been that under the ruling party, \u201cdemocracy is ending, judiciary is no longer independent and fascism is coming to Poland,\u201d Pawlowski said.\n\nConcern is high outside the country. On Thursday, the European Commission referred Poland to the European Union\u2019s Court of Justice for its political interference in the judiciary.\n\n[The new autocrats: How leaders are turning democracy into a tool of oppression]\n\n\u201cBut for ordinary citizens not much changed,\u201d Pawlowski said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see these dangers coming. What they see is they are doing fine, pretty well, and their wages are getting better.\u201d\n\nGoldlewska, the mother with the two boys, said she was still undecided about her vote. She is unsure if she is actually any richer with the expanded government support, as prices have risen at the same time. And she said wonders about the sustainability of the social welfare benefits.\n\nAt the market where she was shopping in Legionowo, 15 miles north of Warsaw, Marcel Klinowski, a 34-year-old new face on the Law and Justice list, was handing out campaign material.\n\nConcerns over the rule of law are just not relevant here, he said.\n\n\u201cIssues like that interest people in the bigger cities, not here,\u201d he said. The town is split politically, with a mayor from the Civic Coalition. But Law and Justice is expected to win an extra seat or two in the constituency, Klinowski said.\n\n\u201cHere, people want to have jobs and earn,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is rising \u2014 that is the big present from Law and Justice.\u201d\n\nJaroslaw Kaczynski, the Law and Justice leader who in effect also leads Poland, has presided over several years of prosperity, with economic growth projected to reach 4 percent in 2019.\n\n\n\nLaw and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski speaks at the party\u2019s convention in Chelm, in eastern Poland, on Friday.

Many people can think and believe life is simply getting better.\u201d\n\nThat might be an illusion though, he said. The cost of living has been increasing. Extreme poverty in Poland rose a percentage point last year, according to Central Statistical Office figures published by Polish media. Choosing to put money in people\u2019s pockets rather than invest in the ailing health and education systems could eventually increase inequality, as the wealthier go private, Pawloski said.\n\nFor Law and Justice politicians, since their party is tipped to win comfortably, the main concern is voter complacency among their supporters, analysts say. Kaczynski has been personally hitting the campaign trail, focusing on the rural east and party strongholds.\n\nCandidates clustered at train stations in Warsaw on Thursday, trying to swing undecided voters.\n\n\u201cLaw and Justice will win, the question is how big the win will be,\u201d said Bartlomiej Radziejewski, director of Nowa Konfederacja think tank and magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say right now if the majority will be absolute. It depends on some factors which are hard to predict.\u201d\n\nThe party won 38 percent of the vote in 2015, but it was able to secure a majority because smaller parties failed to reach the threshold for parliament.\n\nLaw and Justice\u2019s current polling lead comes despite numerous scandals, which appear to be of little concern to the voters. Public television, meanwhile, has repeatedly run recordings of opposition politicians in sometimes foul-mouthed and improper, but not illegal, discussions with business leaders.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like politicians here in Poland, because they always steal their money and so on,\u201d said Klinowski as he wrapped up the morning\u2019s campaigning in Legionowo. So what\u2019s the difference between the Civic Coalition and Law and Justice in the eyes of Poles? \u201cEverybody steals something, but Kaczynski also gives some money back to people.\u201d\n\nMagdalena Foremska in Warsaw contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump congratulates Poland as it commemorates Nazi invasion\n\nAs Pence heads to Poland for World War II anniversary, an 80-year-old issue remains unresolved\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Law and Justice has introduced generous cash benefits, and voters are scared to lose them.", "authors": ["Loveday Morris", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TbBAil0p8hRgSdvjMB1QdFZc7Gs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XTD4FYHMKUI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
