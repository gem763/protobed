Warren\u2019s favorable rating this week is ten points higher than Biden\u2019s and nine points higher than Sanders\u2019. Among the general public, she and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are the only leading candidates with favorable ratings as high as their unfavorable ones.\n\nOnly 10 percent of Democratic voters say they would be disappointed if she were the nominee, half the percentages that would be disappointed with a Biden or a Sanders nomination. She also scores higher than Biden or Sanders on leadership, honesty and crisis management among Democratic primary voters.", "description": "", "authors": ["Today.Yougov.Com Topics Politics Articles-Reports Biden-Polls-Ukraine-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
