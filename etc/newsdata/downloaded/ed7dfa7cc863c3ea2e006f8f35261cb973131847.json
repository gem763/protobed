Ukrainian officials have said they uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens.\n\nHill testified that Bolton told her to inform National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg of the push for a fresh investigation by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, the reports said.\n\nMulvaney, Giuliani and Sondland also wanted Ukrainian officials to explore the possibility of a Ukrainian role in 2016 election interference.\n\nThis week in the impeachment inquiry: A deadline for Rudy Giuliani, more Capitol Hill meetings\n\nHill said Bolton advised her to contact Eisenberg after a July 10 meeting with senior Ukrainian officials in which Sondland brought up the issue of investigations, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBolton told her he wasn't part of \"whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\" unnamed sources who witnessed Hill's testimony told the Times. He also reportedly referred to Giuliani as \"a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\"\n\n\"I always liked and respected John,\" Giuliani said of Bolton in response to Hill's testimony, according to NBC News. \"I\u2019m very disappointed that his bitterness drives him to attack a friend falsely and in a very personal way. It\u2019s really ironic that John Bolton is calling anyone else a hand grenade. When John is described by many as an atomic bomb.\"\n\nFiona Hill: Former Trump Russia adviser Fiona Hill testifies for 10 hours in impeachment probe\n\nHill told lawmakers that Giuliani's role circumvented the normal national security processes and procedures for forming foreign policy.\n\nThe Times reported that she confronted Sondland about what she considered the rogue foreign policy he was instituting in Ukraine, which is not part of the EU and therefore not normally under the ambassador to the EU's purview.\n\nSondland told her that he was in charge of Ukraine. When she asked who had given him that authority, he replied that the president had, according to the Times.\n\nSondland is expected to testify Thursday.\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes and Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's conspiracy theories thrive: A young democracy battles corruption and distrust\n\nMore: Ex-Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch tells lawmakers Trump 'pressured' State Department to remove her\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bolton decried Ukraine 'drug deal,' Fiona Hill testifies, reports say", "description": "Fiona Hill, an ex-White House adviser on Russia, reportedly testified that Bolton called Giuliani \"a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\"", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UGdPyy3uHyQDzddON2Cd1g--~B/aD0xNTIzO3c9MjI4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/7c466ac9d9727e3d199f02b0bc57a771", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
