Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard \u2014 to push literally all my fear and everything away.\"\n\nVervoort spent her last evening with close friends and family, even sharing a glass of sparkling wine, which she referred to as a painkiller.\n\nCondolences streamed in from across the nation, including from the royal family\n\n\"Marieke 'Wielemie' Vervoort was an athlete tough as nails and a great lady. Her death touches us deeply,\" the family said in a statement.\n\nVervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. Like training hard, she said it gave her control and put \"my own life in my hands.\"\n\n\"I'm really scared, but those (euthanasia) papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it's enough for me, I have those papers,\" she said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"If I didn't have those papers, I think I'd have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. ... I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.\"\n\nVervoort also had epileptic seizures and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs. That resulted in a four-month hospital stay.\n\nA loyal Labrador named Zenn began staying with her, pawing her when a seizure was about to occur. Zenn also pulled her socks out of the sock drawer, she said, and helped carry groceries home when Vervoort bought too much.\n\n\"When I'm going to have an epileptic attack, she warns me one hour before,\" Vervoort said. \"I don't know how she feels it.\"\n\nVervoort said she kept pushing back the day of her death, knowing it could come anytime \u2014 as it can for anyone. She said she can be pain-free one minute, and nearly pass out a few minutes later.\n\n\"You have to live day-by-day and enjoy the little moments,\" she said. \"Everybody tomorrow can have a car accident and die, or a heart attack and die. It can be tomorrow for everybody.\"\n\nVervoort called herself a \"crazy lady.\"\n\nShe talked of flying in an F-16 fighter jet, riding in a rally car, and she was curating a museum of her life going back to at least 14 when she was diagnosed with her rare illness.\n\nShe had spikey hair and wanted to be remembered as the lady who was \"always laughing, always smiling.\"\n\n\"I feel different about death now than years ago,\" Vervoort said. \"For me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up. For me it's something peaceful.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nStephen Wade on Twitter: http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP", "description": "Paralympian Marieke Vervoort said when the day arrived, she had signed the euthanasia papers and was prepared to end her life.
