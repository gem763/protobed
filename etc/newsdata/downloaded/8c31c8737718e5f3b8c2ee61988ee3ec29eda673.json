Rob Carver said Sunday morning.\n\nA 14-year-old girl is dead and an 18-year-old woman is recovering in hospital after they were stabbed at a Halloween party Saturday night in Winnipeg's Tyndall Park neighbourhood, Carver said.\n\nIn a separate incident, two men are also dead after they were found suffering from upper body injuries in a rear lane near Ross Avenue and Isabel Street early Sunday morning.\n\n\"We're certainly on track to a horrible number,\" said Carver, about Winnipeg's rising homicide rate.\n\nThe city has seen 36 homicides this year, which includes seven in the last three weeks alone.\n\nCarver said in the case of the Halloween party, police were called to the 100 block of Kinver Avenue near Inkster Boulevard and Keewatin Street at about 10:45 p.m. CT on Saturday.\n\nPolice tape surrounds a home in the 100 block of Kinver in Winnipeg's Tyndall Park area. (Travis Golby/CBC)\n\nWhen officers arrived, they found two females suffering from stab wounds. Both were taken to hospital in critical condition, but the 14-year-old died from her injuries.\n\nThe 18-year-old's status was upgraded to stable condition.\n\n\"I was stunned. Every single homicide is a tragedy for the city, for the community, for the family and friends who know the person. Some are worse than others, and I think a 14-year-old being murdered is absolutely horrible. It took my breath away this morning,\" Carver said.\n\nHe said more than 10 people were at the party and couldn't say if alcohol was involved. He said no arrests have been made.\n\n\"We have a number of people currently detained. Some where we're speaking to them as witnesses, some detained where we're trying to figure out what role they had. We have not made arrests yet, but I think we have spoken to most of the people we're looking for,\" he said.\n\nPolice were called to Ross Avenue and Isabel Street at 2:30 a.m. where two men were found with serious upper body injuries and later died of their injuries. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\nIn the other incident, police were called Ross and Isabel at 2:30 a.m. Both men were transported to the hospital in critical condition, but died from upper body injuries.\n\nCarver could not say how the men were killed or if weapons were involved. No arrests have been made.\n\nHe said the incident doesn't seem to be random and said it is not connected to the other homicide investigation.\n\nCarver said the investigation is ongoing by members of the major crimes unit. Anyone with information that could help investigators is asked to call 204-986-6219 or Crime Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477).", "description": "Police say a 14-year-old girl is dead after being stabbed at a Halloween party and two men were killed in a separate attack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5337366.1572197611!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kinver-homicide-scene.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
