All you need to know about Facebook's new cryptocurrency Read more\n\nFacebook outlined its plans for Libra in June, in an announcement that was met with concern by governments and critics of the company. The social network\u2019s reputation has been tarnished recently by its role in spreading fake information and extremist videos.\n\nLibra is designed to be backed by a basket of currency assets to avoid the wild swings experienced by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is expected to launch in the first half of 2020.\n\nAnother key difference is that control over it would not be decentralised but entrusted to a Swiss-based non-profit association. Besides Facebook, backers of Libra include the payment companies Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, as well as the ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber.\n\nFrench officials have been outspoken in their warnings about the danger Libra poses. Le Maire said on Thursday: \u201cThe monetary sovereignty of countries is at stake from a possible privatisation of money \u2026 by a sole actor with more than 2 billion users on the planet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Guardian view on Facebook\u2019s Libra: funny money | Editorial Read more\n\nOne concern was the possibility that Libra could help people abandon national currencies in times of crisis, complicating government efforts to manage the economy.\n\nFacebook has promoted Libra as an opportunity to provide low-cost online commerce and financial services to more than 1 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d people \u2013 adults without bank accounts or those who use services outside the banking system, such as payday loans.\n\nLibra, and the Calibra digital wallet that would accompany it, promises eventually to give Facebook opportunities to build financial services into its offerings, expand its own commerce and allow more small businesses to buy ads on the social network.\n\nBut officials have raised concerns about how the currency would be regulated, particularly how it would comply with regulations about combating money laundering and financing of terrorism.", "description": "Finance minister warns monetary sovereignty of governments could be at risk", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse", "Joseph Stiglitz", "John Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42ea83c11aad5ca1490a5874f731266bcdbe8f4e/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c712681c6b6d495c8db6375f1bf3abbc", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
