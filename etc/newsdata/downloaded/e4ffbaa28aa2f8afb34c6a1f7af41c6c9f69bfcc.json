That\u2019s truer than ever with iPadOS, the new software update Apple will be launching for the iPad on Tuesday.\n\nIt marks the first time Apple has separated its iPad software from its iPhone operating system, a move that further distinguishes the two products from one another. It\u2019s a sensible move \u2013 now that smartphones generally have much larger screens today than they did when the original iPad launched in 2010, people are using their phones for some of the tasks they may have turned to a tablet for in the past.\n\nAs such, companies like Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, and others have been positioning their tablets as productivity-oriented devices that offer larger screens than smartphones and better portability than laptops. The iPadOS update will provide new features that are critical in boosting the iPad\u2019s performance in this role as a work device.\n\nThe new iPadOS will be compatible with 11 iPad models, ranging from the iPad Air to the iPad Pro.\n\nFrom new copy and paste gestures to improved multitasking, here are our favorite new features coming to the iPad on Tuesday.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to pin widgets to the home screen.\n\nsource Apple\n\nWidgets in iOS are usually just a swipe away from the home screen. But when iPadOS launches, you\u2019ll be able to pin certain widgets to the device\u2019s home screen, making it easy to see information like upcoming calendar appointments at just a glance.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be able to choose favorite widgets that will always appear on the home screen. It\u2019s a useful addition that can help you make the most out of the extra screen real estate the iPad has to offer.\n\nYour iPad will be capable of functioning as a second display for your Mac.\n\nsource Apple\n\nThird-party apps like Duet Display have made it possible to use your iPad as a secondary display for years, but now this functionality is finally coming to iOS natively. Apple\u2019s next big Mac update, called Catalina, and iPadOS will bring a new feature called Sidecar that turns your Apple tablet into a second Mac display.\n\nThat means you\u2019ll be able to extend your desktop so that it stretches across your Mac and your iPad, making it possible to drag content between both. You can also use the iPad to mirror your Mac\u2019s display, and to edit content on the iPad using the Apple Pencil while seeing the changes occur live on your Mac.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to cycle through multiple apps that are open in Slide Over mode.\n\nsource Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider\n\nApple\u2019s Slide Over feature, which allows you to pin an app to the side of your iPad\u2019s screen in a column view alongside another app, is getting a noteworthy update in iPadOS. When the update launches, you\u2019ll be able to open multiple apps in Slide Over simultaneously and cycle between them with a swipe.\n\nThe iPad is finally going to be compatible with thumb drives.\n\nsource iStock\n\nThe iPad\u2019s inability to support external drives has always hampered its ability to serve as a work computer, but that\u2019s finally changing. The iPad will soon be compatible with external devices such as a USB drive, hard drive, and a microSD card, making it much easier to get content that isn\u2019t saved in the cloud onto your iPad. It\u2019s a feature that competing Windows tablets like Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro have had for years.\n\nThe Files app is getting new views that make it easier to manage content.\n\nsource Apple\n\nApple launched the Files app for the iPad back in 2017, an addition that was necessary in order for the tablet to be taken seriously as a productivity machine. Now, with iPadOS, Apple is making the Files app even more robust and comprehensive with a new column view and other helpful features.\n\nBased on Apple\u2019s presentation, it seems like the column view will make it much easier to find documents quickly without having to dig through your folders. You\u2019ll be able to view sub-folders in a column alongside your main folders, and a new preview pane lets you see images and other content without having to open it.\n\nThe Files app is also getting a new downloads folder for keeping your downloads from the Mail app and Safari all in one place.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to view the progress of files downloaded in Safari.\n\nsource Steve Kovach/Tech Insider\n\nApple\u2019s web browser will finally offer a means of easily managing downloads.\n\nSafari will now have a download manager that enables you to view download progress and quickly access recently downloaded files. That\u2019s a huge win for those who often use their iPad for work-oriented tasks and frequently download material from the web.\n\nSafari will now show the desktop versions of a website on the iPad.\n\nsource Stephen Lam / Getty\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use your iPad like a desktop computer, it should be better at behaving like one. That\u2019s presumably why Apple is adding the ability for Safari to automatically show the desktop version of websites on the iPad, making better use of its larger screen. Apple also says that despite being designed for the desktop, these websites will still be optimized for touch.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to view the same app in different windows.\n\nApple\u2019s Split View feature for the iPad is limited in the sense that it\u2019s not possible to run the same app in multiple windows.\n\nFor example, if you want to open two documents in the Notes app side-by-side, or two tabs in Safari alongside one another, you\u2019re out of luck with Apple\u2019s current software.\n\nBut that\u2019s going to change soon enough, as iPadOS brings the ability to run multiple windows showing the same app. That should make it much easier to work on projects that require multitasking across several documents or websites.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to navigate webpages and documents more precisely with a scroll bar.\n\nTo make it easier to navigate through long documents, Apple is adding support for scroll bar scrubbing on the iPad. When iPadOS launches, you\u2019ll be able to drag the scroll bar to a designated area on a webpage or document, allowing for more precise scrolling just like on the desktop.\n\nThe iPad is getting new gestures for copy, paste, and other actions.\n\nsource Apple\n\nWhile mouse and touchpad is probably still the most natural form of input for work-related tasks, Apple is improving the way touch works on the iPad.\n\nConsider the new copy and paste gestures in iPadOS, for example. You\u2019ll be able to copy text by pinching up from the screen with three fingers, while pinching outward with three fingers will paste the content in the location of your choosing. The gestures are meant to mimic the motion of picking something up and putting it back down, making it easy to remember.\n\nSimilarly, Apple is launching new gestures that make it possible to undo an action by swiping to the left with three fingers and redo by swiping to the right with three fingers.\n\nThe Apple Pencil is becoming more useful.\n\nsource Apple\n\nOne advantage that Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus has always had over the Apple Pencil is its ability to tie into Samsung\u2019s software to enable certain shortcuts and features.\n\nWith iPadOS, it looks like Apple Pencil owners will get a small taste of this type of functionality, too. You\u2019ll be able to take a screenshot in iPadOS by dragging the Apple Pencil from either bottom corner of the screen. While the Apple Pencil is still largely intended to be a tool for drawing, sketching, writing, and annotating rather than user interface shortcuts, it\u2019s refreshing to see another use case for Apple\u2019s stylus.\n\nOther than the new screenshotting feature, the Apple Pencil will be capable of working at a lower latency thanks to Apple\u2019s improved prediction algorithms.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple's iPadOS software update for the iPad will bring several new features that make it a better laptop replacement when it launches on September 24..
