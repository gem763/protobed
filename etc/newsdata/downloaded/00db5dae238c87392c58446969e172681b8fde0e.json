What I would say is, I love the people I love, and I have empathy for people that are in my life for 35 years. I don\u2019t cut people out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had any friends growing up,\u201d added Saget. \u201cSo, I\u2019m lucky to have any in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe actress, her fashion designer husband and nine other parents were slapped with new federal charges earlier this month in a scandal involving dozens of wealthy parents accused of bribing their children\u2019s way into elite universities or cheating on college entrance exams.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN 'TERRIFIED,' 'STRESSED' ABOUT NEW COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL CHARGES: SOURCE\n\nFELICITY HUFFMAN DOING 'REALLY WELL' ONE WEEK INTO PRISON SENTENCE: REPORT\n\nLoughlin, 55, and her husband Mossimo Giannulli, 57, are accused of paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into USC as recruits on the crew team, even though neither participated in the sport.
