It's also a warts and all look at the darker side of Clapton's life and Zanuck doesn't shy away from dealing with his 20-year long battle against drug and alcohol addiction. In one clip Clapton admits, \u2018The only reason I didn\u2019t commit suicide was the fact that I wouldn\u2019t be able to drink any more if I was dead.\u2019\n\nThe 1991 death of his son Conor, in a fall from a New York high-rise, was the trigger to sobriety.\n\nClapton says he\\'s going deaf and his hands \"just about work\"\n\nWith hits such as \"Wonderful Tonight\", \"Cocaine\", \"Tears in Heaven\", and \"Layla\", Clapton has won 17 Grammy Awards, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. He was ranked No. 2 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2015 list of 100 greatest guitarists of all time, behind Jimi Hendrix.\n\nClapton: Life in 12 Bars is out now in the UK.", "description": "The legendary British musician bares his soul in a new documentary about his life and times.", "authors": ["Tokunbo Salako"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/05/13/92/1000x563_story-12d53f14-5d10-5fdf-862a-d62d574f2b91_224706.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-11"}
