Here\u2019s why", "language": "en", "text": "One size doesn\u2019t fit all when choosing a school. Parents should park their obsession with brand-name schools when fit is far more important.\n\n\u201cChoosing a school is like buying a house,\u201d says Janita Gray, editor of the Good Schools Guide. \u201cYou do the research, check out the area but ultimately you make a decision on gut instinct.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s no bad thing, she says. But parents, most heads and advisers agree, can be swayed by kudos and league tables \u2013 which can be an unreliable benchmark for a child. There are some 2,500 independent schools in the UK and they vary wildly in fees, facilities, performance and destinations.\n\n\u201cToo many parents are obsessed by a school\u2019s reputation and place in the league tables without bothering to see if it\u2019s right for their child,\u201d says Gavin Horgan, head Millfield School, in Somerset. \u201cThere are some brilliant schools which aren\u2019t in the premier league. Parents should be guided by instinct and knowledge of their kids.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of nonsense spoken about rankings, agrees Jimmy Beale, a former head and founder of the consultancy The English Education. \u201cElite schools perform brilliantly because they select brilliant pupils. Parents who go solely on brand are doing their child a disservice.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s little difference in performance among the top 20 or so schools, says Mr Gray.", "description": "One size doesn\u2019t fit all when choosing a school.", "authors": ["Helena Pozniak", "James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/09/19/boarding-school-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqW_3u_99mJVPaXyzOm3nl8DyRw1AH2H7akCvqQmpqwVA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
