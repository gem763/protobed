(Murad Sezer / Reuters)\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Turkish state TV on Thursday that he expected the U.S. to comply with the extradition of Syrian Kurdish commander Mazloum Kobani Abdi.\n\n\u201cHe is a terrorist with the code name Mazloum,\u201d Erdogan said in the interview. \u201cAmerica needs to hand over this man to us.\u201d\n\nThe comments came hours after President Trump tweeted in praise of Abdi.\n\nI really enjoyed my conversation with General @MazloumAbdi. He appreciates what we have done, and I appreciate what the Kurds have done. Perhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019\n\nThe president also mentioned Abdi before his speech Wednesday on the permanent ceasefire agreement between Turkey and the Kurds, extending his thanks to the Kurdish commander and saying \u201cI look forward to seeing you soon.\u201d\n\nErdogan also said in the interview that he would bring up Abdi during his upcoming White House visit with Trump, which is scheduled for November 13. He also said the pair would discuss the now-infamous letter that Trump sent October 9 urging Erdogan to not be a \u201ctough guy\u201d and reach an agreement with the Kurds.\n\nTrump also mentioned in the letter that Abdi was \u201cwilling to make concessions that they would never have made in the past,\u201d and enclosed a copy of a letter from the SDF commander for Erdogan to see.\n\n\u201cIt was quite inappropriate to attach the letter from a terrorist to his cover letter,\u201d Erdogan said Thursday in commenting on the situation.\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s withdrawal has been enacted, Congress has been outspoken in its defense of the Kurds. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to Secretary of State State Mike Pompeo to expedite a visa for Abdi to visit the U.S. and \u201cdiscuss the path forward in deescalating conflict in Syria and the path forward in the fight against ISIS.\u201d", "description": "The comments came hours after President Trump tweeted in praise of the Kurdish commander, Mazloum Kobani Abdi.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Ilya Shapiro", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
