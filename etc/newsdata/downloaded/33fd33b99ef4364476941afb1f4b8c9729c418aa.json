The government declared the debt unpayable in June 2015, and nearly two years later filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in US history.\n\nThe new restructuring plan targets bonds and other debt held by the government and will now go before a federal judge. The percentage of Puerto Rico's taxpayer funds spent on debt payments will fall to less than 9%, compared to almost 30% before the restructuring.\n\nIt would also cut pensions for retirees who receive more than $1,200 a month.", "description": "The federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances on Friday released a plan that would cut the island's debt by more than 60% and rescue it from bankruptcy.", "authors": ["Donna Borak", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924005808-sismo-puerto-rico-no-hay-alerta-tsunami-brk-00001814-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
