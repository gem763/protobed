Kumalo was beaten and stomped to death by Mthethwa in Cape Town on April 13 2013. The crime was captured on CCTV and showed Mthethwa attacking her next to his Porsche.\n\nIn sentencing Mthethwa, Judge Patricia Goliath noted the \u201ccallousness, cruelty and brutality\u201d of Mthethwa\u2019s actions.\n\nThere was similar outrage and public protests in 2017, when Mthethwa\u2019s work was displayed at the Our Lady exhibition at the Iziko National Gallery.\n\nThe exhibition at the Javett centre, titled All in a Day\u2019s Eye: The Politics of Innocence, was curated by Gabi Ngcobo. She and the University of Pretoria\u2019s vice-chancellor, Prof Tawana Kupe, were called on to take responsibility for providing space for a murderer\u2019s artwork.\n\nNgcobo responded by saying that the inclusion of Mthethwa\u2019s artwork was intended to spark conversation about gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cAs black women working in the arts, we too feel that the misogyny that is often hidden in art spaces has long affected women personally, professionally, violently, and it needs to be discussed openly with different constituencies of society,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Sweat\u2019s Lesego Tlhwale said that including the work of a convicted murderer was not the way to go. \u201cIt is silencing and makes the victims invisible,\u201d she said.\n\nSweat and other activist groups have demanded that the work, titled The Wedding Party (1996), be removed immediately.\n\n\u201cWe do not doubt the curator\u2019s intentions to prompt an important conversation, but we believe that it is terribly misguided to centre such a discussion on Mthethwa\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line for our call is to get his artwork removed and for any other work he has produced never to be displayed again in public galleries,\u201d said Tlhwale.\n\nThey also called on other artists whose work is being exhibiting at the Javett centre to protest by removing their pieces.\n\nAcclaimed South African artist Candice Breitz answered the call this week and withdrew her work.\n\nThe centre is believed to have turned down a request to replace Breitz\u2019s work with a protest placard from Sweat\u2019s #SayHerName campaign reading: \u201cMy name was Nokuphila Kumalo. I was a sex worker. I was 23 years old. I was found beaten to death. Zwelethu Mthethwa has been convicted for my murder.\u201d\n\nNgcobo maintained that the message behind placing Mthethwa\u2019s work in the show had been misconstrued.\n\n\u201cI wanted this collection to be seen, experienced and read through black women\u2019s eyes. We did not have to show all the works in the collection, so we made very thought-out choices. It was not an easy decision to show The Wedding Party by Mthethwa.\n\n\u201cHis work is there [so that] we never forget what he did and because it was an opportunity to unpack his work alongside that ultimate violent act that we got to know about because a life was lost,\u201d she said.\n\nTlhwale said she could not imagine how Kumalo\u2019s mother would feel knowing that Mthethwa\u2019s incarceration had not stopped him from having his work seen.\n\nSouth African multimedia artist Athi-Patra Ruga said the issue raised \u201cbigger, long-standing questions about the art world\u2019s ethics\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese won\u2019t simply go away by removing and denying [viewers] the opportunity to witness and be part of the national debate and have the autonomy to make up their own minds,\u201d she said.", "description": "What should happen to the artistic work of a convicted murderer?
