In private, however, the president often strikes a different, more nuanced tone\u2014one driven by a concern that socialism (at least as defined by the Democrats) may actually sell politically.\n\nThis year, Trump has repeatedly told friends and donors that running against \u201csocialism\u201d in a general election may not be \u201cso easy\u201d because of its populist draw, according to four Republicans and sources close to Trump who\u2019ve heard him say this over the past several months.\n\nAccording to a person who was in the room, Trump told donors at a recent private event that though \u201ca lot of people think it\u2019ll be easy to beat [in 2020],\u201d the \u201ctruth is, it might not be so easy.\u201d The president, according to the source, said that \u201cyou can have someone who loves Trump, but many people love free stuff, too.\u201d He added that if candidates tell Americans, especially young voters\u2014that they\u2019re going to cancel their debt, \u201cthat\u2019s a tough one\u201d to run against.\n\n\u201cI have discussed the popularity of the democratic socialists\u2019 message, i.e. Sanders and [Elizabeth] Warren, with President Trump on more than one occasion and in person,\u201d said Eric Bolling, a BlazeTV host and friend of the Trump family. \u201cSpecifically the idea of excusing debt and giving away, [as Trump says], \u2018free stuff\u2019 becoming more and more popular among younger voters.\u201d\n\nBolling said Trump had made these comments to him as recently as mid-2019. \u201cI feel it was more an observation than a re-election concern [of the president\u2019s],\u201d he recalled. \u201cI feel the discussion was more of a tamping-down of expectations than any serious concern about winning re-election in 2020. It\u2019s politics. Just look to Joe Biden who recently suggested Iowa isn\u2019t a must win state.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s private concessions don\u2019t reflect the message he and his party organs have typically pushed in public. Over the last year, the president, his campaign, the Republican National Committee, and a host of other prominent GOP campaign groups have sought to paint much, if not all, of the Democratic field as \u201csocialist.\u201d It\u2019s a playbook they\u2019ve used many times before, including against President Barack Obama. But it is widely believed to have more resonance now, with more progressive candidates\u2014including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the self-identifying democratic-socialist\u2014 running in the Democratic primary. The attack line is so central to the GOP playbook, that Trump even used it in his 2019 State of the Union address.\n\n\"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\" Trump said. \"America was founded on liberty and independence\u2014not government coercion, domination, and control\u2026Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d\n\nThat Trump\u2019s private views about the political efficacy of socialism don\u2019t reflect his public utterances reflects, to some degree, his own unconventional approach to elected politics. The president ran in 2016 as a Republican, but with unorthodox views, having pledged repeatedly not to cut entitlement programs and to use the levers of the government to go after individual companies or industries that he deemed hostile to the U.S. economy or workforce.\n\nSince entering office, he\u2019s often governed along these lines, targeting companies that outsource jobs and subsidizing farmers who have been hurt by his trade war with China. The pattern was strong enough that Sanders took to the Wall Street Journal (a bastion of conservative economics) to pen a column saying Trump was \u201cthe Worst Kind of Socialist.\u201d\n\nThat Trump has been conceding that socialism could be politically potent didn\u2019t catch Sanders\u2019 campaign by surprise.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I feel so strongly about Bernie\u2019s ability to beat Trump is because we know that the Democratic nominee will have to credibly explain that Trump betrayed the working class with false promises and that he does not put forward real solutions to help struggling people,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019s 2020 campaign manager. \u201cBernie can and will do that successfully. We\u2019ll have a national debate about policies that help the one percent versus policies that lift the 99. I get the sense Trump knows the reckoning is coming and is worried about being exposed as a fraud. No Sharpie edits will save him.\u201d\n\nFor Sanders to get to the point of having a national debate with Trump over the merits of socialism, he must first survive the Democratic primary. But even if he doesn\u2019t make it through that gauntlet, the Senator will have managed to move the contours of the debate. Four years ago, Sanders and his team were warning liberals that they shouldn\u2019t underestimate Trump\u2019s appeal, precisely because it spoke to the desire for voters to have government side with them over the elites.\n\nNow, it appears, socialism is roughly as popular as Trump. And the president himself recognizes that Sanders, the only self-described, avowed socialist running, may be more formidable than he previously thought. As The Daily Beast reported in April, Trump will\u2014at times totally unprompted\u2014bring up Sanders\u2019 working-class support and concede that there is, in fact, potential for the democratic socialist to win over some Trump voters with his populism, including on trade, sources who\u2019ve discussed this with the president said.\n\nTrump also indicated that he\u2019s been impressed by Sanders\u2019s ability to fire up his base, rake in small-dollar donations, and attract big crowds at rallies, though not\u2014in the president\u2019s words\u2014as \u201cgood as Trump.\u201d", "description": "The president is not totally sold on the attack line that he and his team have made so central to their campaign.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Stein", "White House Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567988982/190908-Swin-Trump-tease_ak2i8x", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
