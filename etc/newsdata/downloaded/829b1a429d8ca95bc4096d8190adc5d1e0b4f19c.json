Wall Street analysts expected a 10-cent EPS loss and $182 million in revenue.\n\nLooking ahead, Cloudera also guided for third-quarter revenue of between $187 million and $190 million and an EPS loss of between 6 cents and 8 cents. Cloudera also announced the acquisition of cloud-based business intelligence firm Arcadia Data.\n\nSeveral analysts have weighed in on Cloudera\u2019s impressive report. Here\u2019s a sampling of what they had to say.\n\nStep In The Right Direction\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the second-quarter report was a much-needed step in the right direction after a difficult period for the company.\n\n\u201cThe company (and its investors) have been through a hurricane-like storm over the past six months as Cloudera has tried to successfully integrate the Hortonworks deal, while navigating a choppy Hadoop market,\u201d Ives wrote in a note.\n\nBank of America analyst Kash Rangan said that despite signs of progress in the second quarter, there are still too many moving parts at Cloudera to get a clear picture of the company\u2019s outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile the company hopes to achieve 15%-20%+ revenue growth and 20%+ cash flow margins in the long-term, in our view, getting there or at least meaningfully closing the gap from where we are now might be a tall order,\u201d Rangan wrote.\n\nCDP Is Coming\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh said the next big catalyst for Cloudera will be the launch of Cloudera Data Platform.\n\nView more earnings on CLDR\n\n\u201cManagement is focused on improving cash flow and renewal execution while looking to reinvigorate growth with the upcoming launch of CDP,\u201d Singh wrote.\n\nJMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens said Cloudera has several important catalysts ahead, most importantly the launch of Cloudera Data Platform.\n\n\u201cThis should allow Cloudera to begin to participate in the white-hot market for cloud databases, which Gartner estimates reached $10.5B in 2018, up a staggering 87% y/y,\u201d Walravens wrote.\n\nRatings And Price Targets\n\nWedbush has a Neutral rating and $8.50 target.\n\nMorgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating and $7 target.\n\nBank of America has an Underperform rating and $7 target.\n\nJMP has a Market Outperform rating and $12 target.\n\nShares traded around $8.29 at time of publication.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nAnalysts Still Bullish On Slack Despite Earnings Sell-Off\n\nCarl Icahn Rips Anadarko Buyout, Talks Cloudera And Trade War\n\nLatest Ratings for CLDR\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Maintains Neutral Sep 2019 Maintains Neutral Sep 2019 Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CLDR\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
