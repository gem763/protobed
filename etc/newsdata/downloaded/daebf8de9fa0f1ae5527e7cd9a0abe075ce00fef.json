Now they're turning around saying they're not paying out, they will pay out for two single bets.\n\n'On Monday, I texted Chris saying, ''Have you got our money?'' but it turns out Hill's don't keep betting slips in branches for more than six weeks.\n\n'When the Jackson part of it came through, we said, ''Absolutely fantastic, let's collect our winnings''.\n\n'Now they're saying the bet isn't a double because of something called related contingency. I'd never even heard of that in my life.\n\n'I didn't know how to fill in the slip, so the employee said he'd do it for us and Kris has had it on his fridge.\n\n'I went in the bookies' yesterday and the same employee was in. He turned around and said, ''I must've been half asleep that morning!''\n\n'We'd already said that if we win we're going on a Caribbean cruise with our wives.\n\nBut bookmaker William Hill is refusing to pay out, insisting they are separate bets and should never have been allowed, leaving Mr Smeaton furious\n\nHe is promising to pursue his claim all the way as his expected \u00a323,400 windfall may turn into just \u00a31,700\n\n'I'll take them to the ombudsman, I'll take it to the highest level possible. I'm not afraid of taking it to court.'\n\nWilliam Hill admitted the bet, which clearly states '\u00a3100 double' on the slip, was only made because of 'human error.'\n\nBut they insist they will not be paying out in full.\n\nA spokesman said: 'As stated in our rules, a related contingency occurs when one or more parts of the bet placed affect the outcome of the bet.\n\n'In this case, the prices of Jackson Hastings winning Man of Steel and Salford finishing in the top five are related. Were one outcome to happen, the other would be directly affected and as such the double price would be significantly smaller.\n\n'This bet has been struck as a result of human error and as such has been corrected.\n\n'At no point was the double on offer before the start of the season. Unfortunately, we realise this is disappointing for the customer and we can only apologise.\n\n'In cases such as this, IBAS (Independent Betting Adjudication Service) offer an impartial adjudication on disputes between customers and licensed gambling operators.'\n\nHowever, Mr Smeaton countered that by adding: 'They have contradicted themselves by saying it's not a double then it is a double but with smaller odds.\n\n'Also the point of one bet going on to the other is rubbish as the Man of Steel goes into secret voting run by a poll of adjudicators in the last eight weeks.\n\n'So how can that influence the other part of the bet?'", "description": "Gary Smeaton, 49, and best friend Kris Shenton thought they were in line to scoop \u00a323,400 after a \u00a3100 double bet on the Salford Red Devils and player Jackson Hastings.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/13/19491192-0-image-a-19_1570625562834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
