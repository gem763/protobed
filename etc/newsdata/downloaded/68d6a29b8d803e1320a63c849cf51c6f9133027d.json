The fixer and confidante of presidents, little known outside Argentine political circles just five months ago, is set to take on the top job in Latin American\u2019s no. 3 economy.\n\nPresidential candidate Alberto Fernandez celebrates his victory after election results in Buenos Aires, Argentina October 27, 2019. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\n\nThe moderate Peronist, a fan of Bob Dylan after whom he named his brown-and-white collie, will now need to pull off an even tougher maneuver, with the country gripped by default fears, inflation and flat-lined growth.\n\nArgentine voters cast their ballots on Sunday, handing Fernandez an outright win over incumbent Mauricio Macri, a meteoric rise for the university professor who was announced as a candidate in May by his higher-profile running mate, ex-leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.\n\n\u201cAlberto is a person who is in the right place at the right time,\u201d said former Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana, who between 2003 and 2008 served in the same Cabinet as 60-year-old lawyer and teacher Fernandez.\n\n\u201cHe is an intelligent man, with good training, who listens, who dialogues, who defends his point of view,\u201d Taiana told Reuters. \u201cI never saw him have a dogmatic position.\u201d\n\nThose negotiating skills will be key. Beyond the election, the country is set for complex discussions with its creditors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), after a crash in the peso currency left Argentina on the edge of default as reserve sunk and borrowing costs jumped.\n\nThat crash was sparked ironically by Fernandez\u2019s own, unexpected landslide victory in a primary election vote against Macri in August, as investors worried about his populist running mate and question marks over Fernandez\u2019s own policy views.\n\nTIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN\u2019\n\nThat flexibility has helped him unite the nebulous Peronist political flank, his gentler, man-of-the-people image helping lure middle-ground voters worried about the return of divisive ex-president Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.\n\nHe has continued to oversee exams until this month at the University of Buenos Aires where he teaches.\n\nIn a reflection of his chameleon-like mutability, Fern\u00e1ndez has been both a lawmaker for Buenos Aires in a party of neo-liberals, a Peronist chief of staff and part of the Radical Civic Union party in the 1980s.\n\nThat\u2019s reflected in an eclectic taste in music. Behind the austere mustache and formal suit he wears as a law school professor, Fernandez hides a rock-loving musician who turns to the guitar every time Argentine politics lets up.\n\nHe is a \u201cmusic freak, a very cultured guy,\u201d Argentine rock pioneer Lito Nebbia - an idol and later a friend - said about the Peronist candidate in a radio interview this year.\n\nAsked about his ideological influences, Fern\u00e1ndez said in a radio interview they included more obvious political thinkers such as former president Juan Peron, the ideological father of Peronism, but also a string of South American and North American musicians.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s also a lot of Nebbia, Bob Dylan, Joan B\u00e1ez, and El Flaco (Luis Alberto) Spinetta,\u201d said Fernandez, who as a 16-year-old teenager grew his mustache in honor of Nebbia and even took guitar lessons with him.\n\nDylan, the American songwriter behind \u201cBlowin\u2019 In the Wind\u201d and \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019\u201d even inspired the name of his collie, which itself has a huge fan base on social media and is often seen alongside Fernandez.\n\nA REAL PERONIST?\n\nA big question for many - investors, farmers and voters - has been how burnished are Fernandez\u2019s Peronist credentials: ranging from fears he could be a puppet for more extreme \u201cKirchnerist\u201d views to worries he\u2019s not Peronist enough.\n\nPeronism is a broad political movement that spans across the political spectrum but is grounded in an idea of \u201csocial justice\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him. In his head he\u2019s not a Peronist. Alberto\u2019s economics are neo-liberal,\u201d Guillermo Moreno, a former secretary of commerce who was in the Cabinet with Fernandez for years, said earlier this year.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez, raised in a family of lawyers, has worked within Peronism for years. He was Chief of Staff under husband-and-wife pair N\u00e9stor Kirchner from 2003-2007, and the first year of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who ruled from 2007 until 2015.\n\nFernandez is also a fanatic for Argentinos Juniors soccer club, whose stadium stands a few blocks from the house where he grew up in the Villa del Parque neighborhood of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe relationship with his running mate is also complex. He was sharply critical of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez during her administration, which saw the introduction of populist policies including currency controls, as well as limits and taxes slapped onto farm imports.\n\nThe pair reconciled last year and have used their differences to great effect to sweep back into the Casa Rosada presidential palace. Whether it lasts is another question.\n\n\u201cUntil the (mid-term) elections in 2021 there will be no problems, the alliance will be maintained. But I don\u2019t know what will happen in 2023,\u201d a source close to Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner told Reuters, referring to the next general election.\n\nFor now, Fernandez is basking in the glow of leading what was a fragmented Peronist opposition back to power.\n\n\u201cAlberto is just the best candidate,\u201d deputy Jos\u00e9 Luis Gioja, leader of the Peronist Justicialist Party (PJ), told Reuters. \u201cHe greatly helped the unity of the PJ and the country\u2019s progressives.\u201d", "description": "Alberto Fernandez has already pulled off something of a coup.
