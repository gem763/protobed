Lip of the plug hole is only a few cm below the waterline.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Just to confirm, these guys are using float tubes, not boats. Their legs are beneath the water.\n\n\"They wear flippers like scuba divers. So they'd just hit the wall of the plughole. Be almost impossible to go over the edge.\"\n\n(Image: Flo Neilson/BBC)\n\nSevern Trent, which owns the reservoir, stated: \u201cWe\u2019re glad for individuals to use our reservoir for boating and fishing, and boats can be found to rent from the fishery.\n\n\u201cHowever, we do ask that folks keep nicely away from the plug hole, as clearly that is actually harmful.\n\n\u201cWe will be reminding everyone who uses the water to avoid the plug hole area and stay safe.\u201d", "description": "The fearless duo were filmed by a stunned dog walker as they paddled around the plug hole at Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Flo Neilson Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668495.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PRIO-Anglers-float-just-feet-away-from-terrifying-66ft-plug-hole-in-lake.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
