REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun\n\nThe 21-year-old Monegasque is therefore not ruling out making some changes to his diet after a season that has catapulted him into the spotlight as the Italian team\u2019s brightest young prospect.\n\nNext season, if Ferrari can carry their gathering momentum into 2020, could even see Leclerc challenging for the championship after losing out to Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes outfit this year.\n\n\u201cI am not vegan, but I am obviously looking into all of these things,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview at the Mexico City offices of Ferrari\u2019s long-standing fuel and oil partner Shell.\n\n\u201cI want to be 100% in the physical form, and I\u2019ve got some programmes to follow, but I\u2019m looking into that too. I like beef but I\u2019m looking also to try and go more into that (other) direction.\u201d\n\nFive times world champion Hamilton recently stirred up a storm on social media with social media posts expressing despair at the state of the planet and urging people to go vegan.\n\nHamilton has spoken often of the benefits he feels of switching to a plant-based diet.\n\n\u201cI think Lewis is a good example of going vegan. But at the moment different drivers have different opinions on that. I\u2019m just trying to follow the best way and the way I feel the best with myself,\u201d said Leclerc.\n\nThe Monegasque said he was also keen to see more use of bio-fuels, with talk of the sport increasing the content to 20% when new rules come into force in 2021.\n\n\u201cI am definitely interested in that and I think Formula One should do the absolute maximum to try and go in that direction,\u201d he said.\n\nHARD ON HIMSELF\n\nOn track, Leclerc has more than matched his team mate Sebastian Vettel this season and with four races remaining is ahead of the four times world champion on points, podiums, wins and poles.\n\nHis four poles in a row between Belgium and Russia took his tally to six for the season, drawing comparisons to Ferrari great Michael Schumacher.\n\nIf he has much to be proud of in his first season with the Italian team, for whom he is now their youngest race winner, Leclerc is also unrelenting in self-criticism.\n\nHe has called himself stupid over the team radio airwaves, and to shut up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been very hard on myself, it\u2019s the way that works with me. I don\u2019t like to hide the errors I make. Any time I\u2019m doing a mistake, I\u2019m just saying it,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the easiest way to improve from that afterwards. I analyse everything I do and when I see something I don\u2019t like I try to find the solution and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so hard on myself.\u201d\n\nNext season will be the same, he said.\n\n\u201cIt might be that for some drivers it doesn\u2019t work like that but on my side I\u2019m pretty sure this is the way forward so I will stay like this,\u201d he declared.\n\nBoth Ferrari and their drivers have paid the price for mistakes and mechanical failures, against Mercedes rivals who rarely put a wheel wrong, and Leclerc said he and the team had work to do in 2020.\n\nHe would not want to undo this year\u2019s mistakes, however.\n\n\u201cWhether I would go back in the past to change them, I don\u2019t think so because I think you learn from mistakes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cConsistency will be extremely important next year if we\u2019ve got the car to win the championship. Consistency will be key and I need to work on that.\u201d\n\nHIGH HOPES\n\nMercedes are sure of an unprecedented sixth successive title double this year, with Hamilton in a position to wrap up his sixth drivers\u2019 championship at Sunday\u2019s Mexican Grand Prix and the constructors\u2019 crown already won.\n\nFerrari look safe in second place and go into the race with high hopes, literally at a track some 2,200 metres (7,200ft) above sea level.\n\nLeclerc recognised there was a chance of adding a third win to his season\u2019s tally.\n\n\u201cOverall I think...we should be quite good. There are long straights, our engine seems to be working pretty well, our straight line speed is good and our cornering speed since some races is also good,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes but I\u2019m feeling positive.\u201d", "description": "Charles Leclerc likes a nice steak and is a long way from following Lewis Hamilton in going vegan but, like every Formula One driver, Ferrari's young ace is interested in any advantage he can get.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444313398&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N017", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
