However, at that stage in my ignorance, I thought there were no options other than to continue as I was, and I buried those feelings.\"\n\n'I used to pray for God to change me into a woman'\n\nWhen she was 34, she started identifying privately to her family as genderqueer. When those confusing feelings came up again, they intensified over time and she came out to her family as a transgender woman at 36.\n\nSarah first she came out to her wife, Anie, and said: \u201cI think I might actually be a woman.\u201d\n\nAnie was and is happy that Sarah is happy and is supportive of her transition.\n\nSarah is also polyamorous and came out to her other partner as well when she knew she was ready.\n\n\u201cWhen I had decided that transition was something I needed to do, I told my kids. That was a month or two later. Then it took me about another two months to come out to more extended family,\u201d she says.\n\n'She did not want me to fetch her from school'\n\nSarah\u2019s kids, 14-year-old Kira and 12-year-old Zoe each reacted a little differently.\n\n\u201cThey were both happy for me, but there were worries about who to tell and when, and how they handle questions about their dad,\u201d says Sarah.\n\nZoe was very worried about how other people would react, including her friends, her school and even neighbours who they walk their dogs with.\n\nShe was also concerned about public confrontations.\n\nLuckily, Sarah went to each person they usually talk to or interact with on their walks and came out to them so as to assure Zoe that there were no negative reactions.\n\n\u201cZoe struggled with school knowing and kids knowing,\u201d says Sarah.\n\n\u201cFor a while when I was first changing my presentation, she did not want me to fetch her from school or for any of her friends to see me. Kira was a lot more relaxed about her peers and school, mostly wanting everybody to know so she wouldn\u2019t have to explain or tolerate misgendering without being able to correct people.\"\n\nIt took everyone a little while to get Sarah\u2019s pronouns correct and get used to her new name, but the kids were the quickest to pick it up.\n\n\u201cKira now says when she reads a book where a dad is \u2018he\u2019, she feels weird. It helped that I don\u2019t see the word \u2018dad\u2019 as gendered, but rather a title, so they didn\u2019t change what they called me,\u201d says Sarah.\n\n'Hiding this helps nobody'\n\n\u201cThey did ask questions, but I just answered honestly.\"\n\nAnd honesty is exactly one of the things that Sarah says is important when explaining your transition to your kids.\n\n\u201cThere are many scary elements to transitioning. They will know that you are scared. Hiding this helps nobody, and will let their fears grow in their mind,\u201d says Sarah.\n\n\u201cAddressing them head-on allows you to comfort them that all the difficulties are conquerable. Be vulnerable in your honesty.\u201d\n\nFlexibility is also important says Sarah; because she doesn\u2019t mind being called \u2018dad\u2019, she feels it really helped them.\n\nI think it helped them not feel like they\u2019d lost their Dad.\n\nBut most important is patience, says Sarah. \"They will have fears, and you need to separate yourself from the equation so you can appreciate their struggle and support them to overcome them.\u201d\n\n\"That part is not about you. The part that is about you they are likely just to accept.\"\n\nThere are going to be certain anxieties and concerns as you reveal to your family, especially your children that you are now a part of a minority that is heavily discriminated against, but Sarah says that kids are more likely to accept the \u201ccore truths\u201d about your transition than adults.\n\nSarah\u2019s kids aren\u2019t confused about who their dad is, as Kira said this to Sarah when she heard her dad was being interviewed for this article:\n\n\u201cWhen my friends ask about how I feel about your transition, I tell them my dad is the same as she always was, just happier.\u201d\n\n*All names have been changed.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
