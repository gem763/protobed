Amy Klobuchar on Tuesday slammed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for working to block bills aimed at bolstering election security, saying it is \u201cnot American\u201d to continue to allow a foreign power to \u201cinvade\u201d U.S. democracy.\n\n\u201cThis is about our democracy \u2014 it\u2019s a foreign power trying to invade our democracy,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar, a 2020 presidential candidate from Minnesota, said Tuesday evening on MSNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you are a conservative Republican or a liberal Democrat \u2014 it is not American to allow that to continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should do everything to protect the sanctity of our elections, and he knows that,\u201d she said of Mr. McConnell. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d\n\nMs. Klobuchar touted legislation she has introduced along with Sen. James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican, and others that would require backup paper ballots and provide grants for states to upgrade their election security, among other priorities.\n\nCritics on the left have labeled Mr. McConnell \u201cMoscow Mitch,\u201d accusing him of failing to move quickly enough to pass election security legislation in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut he has said the Trump administration is moving behind the scenes to counter Russia and other potential interferers, and took exception with that nickname earlier Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s modern-day McCarthyism,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cUnbelievable for a Cold Warrior like me who spent a career standing up to the Russians to be given a moniker like that. It\u2019s an effort to smear me. You know, I can laugh about things like the Grim Reaper, but calling me Moscow Mitch is over the top.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
