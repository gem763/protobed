We had planned to be with the rest of our family in Barbados for half term break.\n\n\"Unfortunately I became poorly with an infection before we were due to leave. I am not able to join them for the time being, even though I am feeling better.\"", "description": "Coleen Rooney was unable to make the family trip to Barbados because she's contracted an infection", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Mirror.Co.Uk", "Chrisbrandis.Com", "Backgrid"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20721945.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Wayne-Rooney-and-family-enjoying-in-Barbados.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
