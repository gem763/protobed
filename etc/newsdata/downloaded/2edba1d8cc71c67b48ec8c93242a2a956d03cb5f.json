SHAME!!!!!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a massive missed opportunity that #TheBachelor is once again going to be a white man. Mike Johnson would\u2019ve been the perfect choice,\" another tweeted. \"A charming, vulnerable, and strong black Bachelor is the representation the world needs right now. There\u2019s always season 25 though, right?\"\n\nOthers pointed out how generic Weber was compared to past \"Bachelors\":\n\nOther fans expressed their disappointment via GIF:\n\n'BACHELOR' ALUM CORINNE OLYMPIOS REVEALS DARK SIDE OF REALITY FAME\n\nPart of why fans were so let down was that \"Bachelor\" host Chris Harrison previously told People that Johnson had a strong shot at the \"Bachelor\" title.\n\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s a contender [for Bachelor],\u201d Harrison said. \u201cHow could he not be a contender with that smile? He\u2019s one of my favorite people we\u2019ve ever had on the show. He\u2019s a love of a man. I don\u2019t know him that well, and I consider him a really good friend.\u201d\n\nJohnson himself predicted that Weber would get the gig, telling Entertainment Tonight, \"Based on [the fact that] history repeats itself. I think Peter looks the part. I think it'd be a good, safe, clean season if he were 'The Bachelor.'\"\n\n'BACHELORETTE' STAR TYLER CAMERON FINED FOR SKIPPING COURT TO GO OUT WITH GIGI HADID\n\n'BACHELORETTE' RACHEL LINDSAY TIES THE KNOT\n\nFormer \"Bachelorette\" (and current newlywed) Rachel Lindsay \u2014 the first \"Bachelorette\" of color \u2014 was disappointed in the franchise for not choosing Johnson.\n\n\"I think Peter seems like a very nice guy. He seems lovely. This is absolutely nothing against him, but how many Peters have we seen before? What season are we on? 24. So, we've seen 24 Peters. I'm bored. And it's nothing personal against him,\" Lindsay told Entertainment Tonight, adding that she's sure Weber will be \"great\" but that she'd hoped for a change from the formula.\n\nDEMI LOVATO ROCKS BIKINI AMID RUMORS SHE'S DATING 'BACHELORETTE' STAR MIKE JOHNSON\n\n\"For the first time, I was very confident that we were going to see our first black 'Bachelor.' And so if no one else is going to speak on it, then I guess it's my duty to say it,\" she said. \"I want to be hopeful, but when you have a contestant like Mike Johnson, who seems to check all the boxes, how is he not the 'Bachelor?' I don't understand.\"\n\n'BACHELORETTE' HANNAH BROWN DEFENDS FRANCHISE FROM KELLY RIPA\n\nShe lamented, \"I'm sure they have some reason for not picking him, and I'm going to trust in that, but at the same time, the system isn't working in giving us a 'Bachelor' who is a person of color. So we need to change the system. Something has to be done. Break the rules, step outside the box, give the people what they want!\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOf course, one reason Johnson may not have been chosen is because he may not be looking for love on reality TV anymore.
