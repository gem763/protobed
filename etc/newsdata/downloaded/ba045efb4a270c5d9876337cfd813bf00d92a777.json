The other inmates call him \u2018Mr. Mayor.\u2019 He\u2019s a celebrity in the jail. Everybody is coming up and shaking his hand. He\u2019s enjoying hanging out with the other inmates.\u201d\n\nCohen now \u201chas a job fixing fire hydrants,\u201d which he enjoys, the lawyer said.\n\n\u201cHe looks great \u2014 he is tan, works out every day and has lost more than 30 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is basically very unstressed. The only downside is he misses his family.\u201d\n\nOtisville is seen as one of America\u2019s loftiest prisons, boasting basketball and tennis courts, a baseball field, a full gym and personal sleeping cubicles.\n\nCohen reported to prison on May 6 after pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws for hush-money payments that he says were given to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, a claim that Mr. Trump has denied.\n\nCohen also pleaded guilty to tax evasion, \u201cunderstating his debt and equity,\u201d and lying to Congress.\n\nCohen claimed to The New Yorker before his incarceration that he was the fall guy for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cYou are going to find me guilty of campaign finance, with McDougal or Stormy, and give me three years \u2014 really?\u201d Cohen said at the time. \u201cAnd how come I\u2019m the only one? I didn\u2019t work for the campaign. I worked for him. And how come I\u2019m the one that\u2019s going to prison? I\u2019m not the one that slept with the porn star.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
