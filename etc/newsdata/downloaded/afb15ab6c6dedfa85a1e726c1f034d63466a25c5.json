It was a loss that felt like bereavement.\n\n\u2018The rawness will slowly heal and the tears will slow down,\u2019 my friend said. \u2018But you\u2019re not the same person as before. You are now someone who\u2019s lost a baby. It changes you. It changes the way you think, the way you are. It will always be with you.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was speaking from experience \u2013 she lost the baby she had carried less than an hour after it was born. Of course, she was right.\n\nHer words made me feel sad for the \u2018us\u2019 we had lost. Our Teflon-coated happiness, the bubble we lived in that no longer protected us.\n\nMy partner and I were no longer an excited couple about to have a baby. We were now a couple who had suffered loss, who had tried and failed to have a baby.\n\nThe lens through which we viewed the world was tinged with grief. We had felt young and full of life. Now we felt old.\n\nMy reaction surprised me. Until eight or nine weeks, I had been prepared for miscarriage \u2013 perhaps even expecting it. By 14 weeks, I was not. I cried almost constantly for the first three days. I cried all day until my eyes were swollen closed. I woke in the night, first sobbing silently into my pillow then anguished howls that woke my partner and set him off, too.\n\nGradually the crying stopped, or at least became less frequent. But I still couldn\u2019t go out.\n\nStill, at every mention of the baby, every time someone asked how I was, each appointment, the tears would come.\n\nThey came weeks later when I walked past the hospital where we had painful tests \u2013 a long, thick needle directly into the womb \u2013 to confirm the diagnosis that led to our termination.\n\nMy partner had asked the sonographer to turn off the screen that showed the baby we were about to lose but it was too late.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey came when I opened a drawer to find matches and saw our 12-week scan pictures put away there. My partner had taken them down from the wall. He said they were too painful to look at. I hadn\u2019t been able to take them down. How could I?\n\nWhen I cried constantly those first three days, he was there crying with me (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThey came two months later when my partner handed me our pre-natal file \u2013 scan results, referral letters, appointment details \u2013 to check if there was anything we needed before he threw it away.\n\nI cried, of course. \u2018Oh\u2026 I thought you were okay about it now?\u2019 he said.\n\nHe didn\u2019t mean to sound uncaring. He cares so much. When I cried constantly those first three days, he was there crying with me.\n\nBut now he wanted to stop crying and get back to feeling like himself again. He didn\u2019t want to become someone defined by loss and grief and failure.\n\nI wasn\u2019t ready to let go. A friend who had recently lost a baby at 25 weeks in unfathomable circumstances \u2013 she delivered their stillborn baby, dressed it and held a funeral \u2013 told me not to be afraid of my grief.\n\nShe told me people would try to get me out of it, adding: \u2018They\u2019ll invite you out for drinks to \u201ccheer you up\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t feel you have to go. Stay at home, cry, sit with your grief.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the best advice I had \u2013 not to feel guilty about grieving. Not to feel like I had to pull myself together and get on with it. She also reminded me that the hormones from both pregnancy and post-natal hormones would be flooding my body for three months afterwards and to understand that \u2013 and help my partner to understand it too.\n\nIt was hard \u2013 when your hormones are making you feel and act crazy you haven\u2019t got the clarity to explain it, if you even recognise it. And why shouldn\u2019t my partner take it at face value when I say something that makes him feel bad?\n\nI felt bad too, though. I was lactating and in enormous pain. I felt unattractive, fat, insecure. I had a deep fear that I would now never be able to give my partner a child.\n\nIt was three months before I felt able to spend a night away from my him. I didn\u2019t go out, I only wanted to see him or family.\n\nA few weeks after the loss, we planned a holiday to a beautiful location, an idyllic beach-front hotel with nothing to do all day but look at the ocean. I felt more lonely sitting there next to my partner than I had in years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI looked at the women with post-natal bodies holding their babies and at the thin women in bikinis and I was neither. I had the post-natal body without the baby. I wasn\u2019t ready. I cried.\n\nNow, three months on, I still cry sometimes. I cry writing this. But I finally feel like myself again. Almost. I am a more fragile version. I\u2019m wiser, if I can say that about myself. I am more empathetic to those who have suffered the loss of a child.\n\nThis morning I walked down a sunny street and thought about the future and it wasn\u2019t shaped by the loss of our baby. It was a glimpse into our future and we were happy.\n\nThe need for a baby has quietened to a want.\n\nWe are trying again and I hope it happens. I know how much my partner wants a child and I want to give that to him. But I know, or at least I hope \u2013 and this is in huge part down to how convincing my partner is on this point \u2013 that we will be happy and fulfilled no matter what.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have children, we will live our most wonderful life \u2013 the sort of life we couldn\u2019t lead if we had children. We will travel, we will live in apartments with sharp edges and balconies and big TVs and no garden. We will have impractical cars and drink wine and go to the theatre or dinner at a moment\u2019s notice, sometimes both.\n\nWe will love each other\u2019s company and we will love other people\u2019s children.\n\nYes, the loss has changed me. It has changed us. But I will not let it define us.\n\nBABY LOSS AWARENESS WEEK Baby Loss Awareness Week is held annually from 9 to 15 October.
