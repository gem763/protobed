Last year, Canada became the first industrialized country in the world to legalize the use of recreational cannabis, with 33 U.S. states also giving the green light to medical marijuana since 1996. What had once been a completely taboo topic has become relatively mainstream throughout North America and much of Europe.\n\nOf course, what investors are really waiting for is some form of change at the federal level in the United States. The U.S. is projected to be the leading cannabis market in the world in terms of future sales -- and it's not even close right now. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Stifel foresee U.S. weed sales accounting for 33% to 50% of global revenue, which would make the U.S. the most lucrative marijuana market in the world for businesses and investors.\n\nWe've also witnessed soaring support for legalization. The October 2018 Gallup poll found that 2 out of 3 Americans now favor broad-based legalization, up from just 25% a quarter-century earlier. Further, a separate survey from the independent Quinnipiac University showed that better than 9 out of 10 support the idea of physicians being able to prescribe medical cannabis to patients.\n\nAll signs would appear to point toward some sort of reform away from the drug's current classification as a Schedule I (i.e., illicit) substance. And yet, the prospects for rescheduling or removing marijuana from the controlled-substances list remain bleak.\n\nA drug free zone street sign in a quiet neighborhood.

Democrats in the House have moved to ease banking restrictions on legalized states -- however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appears steadfast in not allowing any marijuana legislation to reach the floor for vote. Republicans have traditionally taken a more negative view of marijuana's expansion, meaning it would likely take a Democrat-controlled Congress before there's any chance of legalization occurring.\n\nThe other problem is that leading health officials and regulatory agencies don't favor the idea of legalizing cannabis, period. And that was on full display last week when U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams issued an advisory entitled \"Marijuana Use and the Developing Brain.\"\n\nSpecifically, Adams' advisory hits on a number of worrying trends, including growing marijuana use among adolescents, as well as women who are pregnant.\n\nThe data presented shows that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration in cannabis plants tripled from 4% to 12% between 1995 and 2014 -- THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid that gets users high -- and points out that dependency, addiction, and other negative consequences are possible with higher potency levels. For those curious, the advisory notes that THC concentration in some legal dispensaries pushes to between 17.7% and 23.2% THC levels, with concentrate products offering considerably higher THC levels.\n\nThe advisory also finds, via a national survey, that marijuana use among pregnant women doubled to 7% from 3.4% between 2002 and 2017.\n\nA judge's gavel next to a handful of dried cannabis buds.
