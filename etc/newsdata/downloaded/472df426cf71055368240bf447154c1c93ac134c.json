(2) trenchant wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy definition of satire for when that uncle declares \u201cRuckus is right!\u201d Now that that\u2019s out of the way, the stone that the builder refused has made a comeback. The Boondocks is returning for two seasons on HBO Max and a 50-minute special. Plus, all of Grandad, Huey, and Riley\u2019s original adventures will be available on the new streaming service. Creator Aaron McGruder\u2019s series will launch in the fall of 2020, following the chaotic little family as they move to a suburban town in Maryland overrun by racist Uncle Ruckus\u2019s \u201cbizarre neo-fascist regime.\u201d It\u2019s already too real. \u201cThere\u2019s a unique opportunity to revisit the world of The Boondocks and do it over again for today,\u201d McGruder said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how different the times we live in are now \u2014 both politically and culturally \u2014 more than a decade past the original series and two decades past the original newspaper comic. There\u2019s a lot to say and it should be fun.\u201d", "description": "HBO Max is at it again.
