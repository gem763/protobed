Shares fell 38.6% on Sept. 6, following a Bloomberg report that the company had hired restructuring advisors, and then rose 17.6% the next day after the company reached settlements to get out of a pending trial in the opioid litigation.\n\nThe last day the stock moved less than 12% was Sept. 4.\n\n\u201cWe see the BioVectra sale as a necessary move to prepare for a worst case scenario in the near-term,\u201d SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia wrote in a note on Tuesday. \u201cWe see this added breathing room as a positive decision.\u201d\n\nThe back story. Mallinckrodt is beset by a number of legal issues, including the opioid litigation, in which state and local governments are seeking to hold it and other companies responsible for the opioid crisis, and a separate lawsuit against the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which, if Mallinckrodt loses, could cost the company $600 million in connection with its Acthar gel drug. After Tuesday\u2019s rally, shares of Mallinckrodt are down 75.4% this year.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nWhat\u2019s new. The sale of BioVectra, announced Tuesday, gives the company a bit of a financial backstop. Mallinckrodt\u2019s piggy bank is running dangerously low; the company drew down the last $95 million of its revolving credit facility in late August.\n\n\u201cWith a number of reports talking about a possible bankruptcy filing scenario, largely overlooking Mallinckrodt\u2019s cash generating capability, we view the divestiture as a positive since it provides additional cushion to meet near-term financial obligations,\u201d Raymond James analyst Elliot Wilbur wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nPrices for Mallinckrodt\u2019s $700 million bond due April 2020, which fell to 59 cents on the dollar on Sept. 5, were up to 72 cents on the dollar Wednesday morning. The bond had been valued near par through mid-May.\n\nBerenberg Capital Markets analyst Patrick Trucchio wrote that, while stock has rallied this month, \u201cwe remain cautious owing primarily to rising litigation risk on opioids and Acthar,\u201d and to disruption in the high-yield bond market.\n\nLooking forward. Shares of the company were down 7.5% in premarket trading Wednesday. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1%.\n\nThe stock, which remains near historic lows, closed at $3.88 on Tuesday. On Sept. 11, 2018, it closed at $32.04.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "The sale of its BioVectra subsidiary, announced Tuesday, gives the company a bit of a financial backstop.
