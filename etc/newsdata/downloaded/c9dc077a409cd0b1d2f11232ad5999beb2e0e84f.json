(AP) - Broncos linebacker Todd Davis appears to have a better chance of playing against the Chicago Bears on Sunday than cornerback Bryce Callahan.\n\nBoth missed the opener and were listed as questionable for Week 2 after limited participation in practice Friday.\n\nCoach Vic Fangio said Davis has improved every day since returning to practice Wednesday for the first time since tearing his left calf July 18.\n\n\u201cStill don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll play this week,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cBut he\u2019s definitely turned the corner and he\u2019s ready to play.\u201d\n\nFangio wasn\u2019t as optimistic about Callahan\u2019s return from a sore left foot, the same one that he broke last December, ending his season with the Bears and requiring surgery.\n\n\u201cI do see him getting better,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to keep seeing some progress tomorrow and then even Sunday.\u201d\n\nCallahan left the Broncos\u2019 stadium practice on July 27 after his left foot was stepped on and he missed most of training camp.\n\nRecently re-signed Corey Nelson, who played on the Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl 50 team, filled in at inside linebacker and Isaac Yiadom at cornerback Sunday at Oakland, where the Broncos lost 24-16.\n\nCallahan, who signed a three-year, $21 million deal with Denver in free agency, was hoping to get the same chance as his former Chicago teammate Adrian Amos, whose interception of Mitch Trubisky in the end zone sealed Green Bay\u2019s 10-3 win at Chicago last week.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Broncos linebacker Todd Davis appears to have a better chance of playing against the Chicago Bears on Sunday than cornerback Bryce Callahan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/broncos_davis_returns_football_11975_c0-334-3873-2592_s1770x1032.jpg?f0ea32d6874660ea8162edd1fc1e6d6fcb0cd5e4", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
