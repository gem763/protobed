I never thought I\u2019d get a gig on radio, let alone one for so long.\u201d\n\nWorland first joined Triple M as an inaugural member of The Grill Team with Stuart McGill and Mark Geyer back in 2009.\n\nAs a number of co-hosts came and went over the years, Worland stayed loyal to the show and remained on air when Lawrence Mooney, Jess Eva and Chris Page took over as hosts at the start of 2019.\n\nBut when he spoke to news.com.au two months ago to celebrate his 10th anniversary on Triple M, it was clear Worland was struggling with his role on Moonman in the Morning.\n\n\u201cI had more than nine years on The Grill Team and we had a certain way that we did things,\u201d Worland told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s focused so much around Lawrence (Mooney), it\u2019s taken me a little bit of time to work out my role in the show. It\u2019s just been a matter of existing and learning.\n\n\u201cThe first few months I wasn\u2019t sure where my role was but in the last couple of months I\u2019ve felt so comfy and I\u2019m really looking forward to where this show will go.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Gus Worland reveals best and worst celebs he\u2019s met during 10 years on air\n\nWorland, whose last show with Moonman in the Morning will be November 8, is leaving the breakfast show to focus on the Gotcha 4 Life Foundation (G4L) which he set up in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s by far the most important thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he told news.com.au about his mental health foundation.\n\nAfter a friend of Worland\u2019s took his own life, the radio star said he \u201cstarted investigating mental health in Australia, and I realised that the number one way to lose your life as an Aussie male between 15 and 44 is to take your own life\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe lose six blokes every single day,\u201d he told news.com.au. \u201cAnd I realised I had this wonderful opportunity to set up a foundation around men\u2019s mental health. I\u2019m talking about getting mentally fit, realising it\u2019s OK to not have everything covered. That it\u2019s OK to not to be OK.\u201d\n\nThe Gotcha4Life team visits schools and sporting clubs across the country, teaching boys and young men the skills they need to navigate modern life \u2014 and giving them the strength to reach out to someone if it all begins to feel like too much.\n\nDespite leaving Moonman in the Morning, Worland will still be heard on Triple M in 2020 as a co-host of Deadset Legends.\n\nHe\u2019ll co-host the Saturday morning show alongside Wendell Sailor and Jude Bolton.\n\n\u201cTo wake up Sydney each morning, have a few laughs, and report the stories that matter, has been a true pleasure!\u201d Worland said in a statement announcing his departure. \u201cIt\u2019s now time for me to step down from my radio commitments to spend more time on my mental health foundation Gotcha 4 Life. We\u2019ve achieved so much in the past two years, I\u2019m excited to spend more time on this and see what we can do!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to be able to stay with the MMMs to talk about one of my lifelong passions \u2014 sport \u2014 and to do so with two sporting legends in Wendell and Jude,\u201d he said.", "description": "Triple M radio star Gus Worland has announced he\u2019s leaving the Sydney breakfast show that he\u2019s co-hosted for 10 years.", "authors": ["Andrew Bucklow"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/22dfd4eb43413c547d33ec3447b2685d?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
