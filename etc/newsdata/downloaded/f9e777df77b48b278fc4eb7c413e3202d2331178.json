Mbappe's layoff created an opening for Angel Di Maria, but the Argentina midfielder scuffed his shot wide from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nBut the home fans did not have long to wait for the breakthrough as Icardi opened the scoring after just 10 minutes. The summer signing reacted quickly to lash home the rebound after his point-blank header had been parried by Mandanda.\n\nMbappe slotted home from a tight angle to give PSG their third goal of the contest on Sunday\n\nIcardi scored the first two goals of the game as Steve Mandanda had a bad day at the office\n\nIcardi almost had a second in the 23rd minute but, after being played in by Mbappe, he was denied by a fine save from Mandanda.\n\nBut the Argentinian made no mistake minutes later, beating Mandanda to Marco Verratti's teasing cross to nod in his seventh goal in five games.\n\nMandanda was under siege and made an impressive diving save to deny Mbappe on the half-hour mark.\n\nBut there was nothing he could do two minutes later when Verratti played in Di Maria with another eye-catching pass and the former Manchester United man squared for Mbappe to tap in his first.\n\nThe win puts PSG a huge eight points ahead of their rivals after 11 games in Ligue 1\n\nPSG saved their best goal of the half for last. A move that started with goalkeeper Keylor Navas calmly passing the ball out of the back while under pressure quickly made its way into the Marseille half, where Di Maria released Mbappe to accelerate away from his marker and power beyond Mandanda.\n\nMbappe should have completed his second hat-trick in as many games but, with 20 minutes left, he scuffed his shot wide of the target after Icardi selflessly squared the ball to his fellow forward.\n\nIt was Mbappe's last involvement as he was replaced by Edinson Cavani.\n\nVisiting midfielder Valentin Rongier tried his luck from outside the area on a couple of occasions, but his first effort was comfortably held by Navas before his second was blocked by defender Thiago Silva.\n\nMarseille should have pulled one back in the 86th minute but after the ball fell nicely for Marley Ake in the area, the substitute could only fire a shot wide of the far post.", "description": "PSG put rivals Marseille to the sword after braces from Kylian Mbappe (right) and Mauro Icardi (left) helped the French champions thrash Andre Villas-Boas' side 4-0 at the Parc des Princes.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20260222-0-image-a-41_1572219786954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
