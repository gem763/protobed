To choose what does appear, Facebook relies on a number of \u201cranking signals\u201d to filter out those that are low-quality.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The system applies to all comments on public pages and posts with large followings.\n\nNothing was unique to Zuckerberg\u2019s speech, Mr Bounds said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Thumbs, hearts and laughs appeared.\n\nThe reason, says Mr Bounds, is that the system shows emoji based on proportion instead of one-for-one \u2013 a necessity for a highly watched stream on which more than 80,000 emoji reactions were shared.\n\nAngry faces were clicked around 900 times during the broadcast, while the thumbs-up was used 77,000 times, according to statistics on the video feed.\n\nDuring the 35-minute talk at Georgetown University, Mr Zuckerberg passionately defended the platform\u2019s approach to free speech, saying \u201dI believe we must continue to stand for free expression\u201d and that the cost of not allowing free speech, in all its messiness, is \u201ctoo great\u201d.\n\nIt is not Facebook\u2019s first run-in with confusing moderation. The company has been under fire most recently for its policy allowing political ads that are misleading or contain lies.\n\nIt has also been criticised for helping spread disinformation ahead of elections and allowing hate speech.\n\nFacebook has tested out different fixes for its problems, such using artificial intelligence to identify hate speech, adding fact checks to controversial posts, and minimising how many people see something that has been identified as untrue.\n\nThe commenting system is an example of how Facebook uses technology to decrease how many eyeballs see problematic posts, while the company sticks to its stated free-speech policy.\n\nContent is not necessarily removed from the site unless it is identified as something that violated Facebook policies, such a threat of violence or hate speech. In this case, the comments that the automated system identified as being lower quality were simply less visible.\n\nAs for the comments that did surface during the stream, they were mostly grateful for the site and its CEO. \u201cThank you for Facebook, it is a powerful applications bringing friends and families together,\u201d said Eunice Maku Ayiku-Nartey from Ghana.\n\n\u201cThanks for creating such an amazing platform that makes it easier and convenient for us to [reach] out to our loved ones and friends without stress,\u201d said Mary Gabby.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "During Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2018s live-streamed speech on the dangers of censorship on Facebook, viewers saw a flood of almost entirely positive comments and emojis.
