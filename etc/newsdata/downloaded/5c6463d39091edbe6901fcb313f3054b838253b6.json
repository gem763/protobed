He told friends \u2013 who told the French edition of Vanity Fair \u2013 that he was on first-name terms with his idol, the Australian singer Kylie Minogue, then partner to the French actor Olivier Martinez, one of his clients. Minogue, he recounted, had sent him a gift: a Rolex Datejust watch hidden in a box of biscuits made by her mother.\n\nWhat the beneficiaries of Levesque\u2019s largesse did not know, however, was that the money he came up with was allegedly not his to lend.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the 49-year-old banker took an estimated \u20ac2m out of wealthy clients\u2019 accounts to lend to not-so-rich but famous friends, and borrowed millions more from others.\n\nOn Monday, Levesque went on trial accused of \u201cabuse of confidence\u201d, fraud and falsifying documents after a French actor reported him to investigators, who accused him of cheating clients out of up to \u20ac5m.\n\nInvestigators do not accuse him of personally profiting financially from his activities, but say Levesque was fascinated by the world of celebrities and wanted to be part of it. Among actors who reportedly trusted him with their secrets and their money were Juliette Binoche, Monica Bellucci and Isabelle Adjani, who told investigators she found the banker \u201cvery competent \u2026 and very kind\u201d.\n\nThe court will hear Levesque\u2019s alleged juggling of clients\u2019 money began in 2003 when he was approached by a well-known French film director who needed a large sum of money to complete his new movie. Unknown to the director, Levesque allegedly took the money from the account of one of his wealthy foreign clients who had an untouched \u20ac2m in the bank and who, he believed, would not notice it was missing if it was reimbursed quickly.\n\nIt was reportedly paid back with interest and nobody was apparently the wiser. Levesque told the police he even paid the interest to the client from whose account the money had been taken but said the problems began when one of his showbiz friends failed to pay back a loan within the agreed time.\n\nIt was at this point, prosecutors say, Levesque found himself in a vicious circle of taking money from accounts to cover the missing funds in others. To do so, they allege, he convinced other celebrated clients to invest in non-existent projects and investments, or forged their signatures on documents. Much of the borrowed money has since been paid back, but others told investigators they are still owed substantial sums.\n\nAmong his victims, the actor Myl\u00e8ne Demongeot allegedly gave him \u20ac1.6m to invest in an imaginary project in Brazil. She told the police briade investigating Levesque that he was \u201cvery clever, charming and intelligent\u201d. The director Alexandre Arcady, who when questioned by police described the banker as \u201calways ready to help\u201d and the actor Samy Naceri, who starred in Taxi, are also listed as victims who lost money.\n\nAlerted by the numerous bank transfers made in his name, Tracfin, the French economy ministry\u2019s anti-money-laundering unit, was ready to bring Levesque in for questioning when he reportedly sent them a long email asking to be seen \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Five days later he was under arrest.\n\nIn an article in the French edition of Vanity Fair, friends said the teenage Levesque, an only child, had adored the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables and had dreamed of becoming a singer and dancer. Aged 27, he moved to Los Angeles for Arista Records, which produced Whitney Houston and Carlos Santana. \u201cIt was one of the best times of my life,\u201d he told friends.\n\nHe returned to France two years later after his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After her death, he joined the branch of a leading French bank that specialised in clients from cinema and television.\n\nA psychiatrist who analysed Levesque as part of the investigation carried out by a juge d\u2019instruction, told police the accused \u201cwanted to please and to be liked\u201d. She said he was looking to \u201cfeed his ego and the feeling of his own importance\u201d.\n\nContacted by Le Parisien newspaper, Levesque\u2019s lawyer did not want to comment before the trial.\n\nThe trial continues until September 25.", "description": "Financier accused of cheating rich celebrity clients out of millions of euros", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea023c2813424f386189d92e0057b51ad5e1064f/0_0_2230_1338/master/2230.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6bf6a20c84acfe3aa595ff9f451fe992", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
