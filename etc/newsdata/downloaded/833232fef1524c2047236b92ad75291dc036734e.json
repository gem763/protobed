The medical bill was dated July 7, 2019 and was for 'reproductive' services. Fotis and Norm Pattis above on September 23, 2019\n\nThe bill was unveiled in a part of a four-page motion filed in Stamford Superior Court on Friday, according to NBC.\n\n'If Ms. Dulos herself did, as the bill suggests, receive medical services on July 7, 2019, she is obviously alive, if not necessarily well,' Pattis wrote in the filing.\n\nLyft hit back saying: 'The insurance claim in question, dated July 7, 2019, is for an auto-billed quarterly fee with no connection to in-person services\u2014the Anthem claims summary in Mr. Dulos\u2019s possession lists this same charge every three months.'\n\n'To allege that Jennifer obtained medical treatment in July is absurd. To allege that Jennifer\u2014together with her family\u2014orchestrated her own disappearance is baseless and cruel,' it adds.\n\nLuft slammed Pattis' allegations as a way to 'blame the victim and inflict pain on her family and loved ones.'\n\nBut family spokesperson Carrie Luft has denied that claim on Monday, saying the bill was an automatic charge that was not actually an in-person hospital appearance. Fotis pictured in court on October 4, 2019\n\nIn court prosecutors have said that Jennifer is the victim of a serious assault and is believed to be dead.\n\nFotis' lawyers on the other hand have argued that Jennifer may have faked her own death.\n\nShe disappeared without a trace as the couple was in the middle of a bitter divorce and custody battle over their children.\n\nPolice launched an extensive search for the missing mother, using cadaver dogs to scour reservoirs near her home.\n\nMichelle Troconis is said to have admitted she had originally lied to police and could not provide an alibi for her boyfriend on the morning Jennifer went missing\n\nFotis has now been charged twice with tampering with evidence after he was allegedly caught dumping trash bags with his girlfriend that contained blood-soaked items of Jennifer's clothing the day she disappeared.\n\nProsecutors also say they found traces of her blood in seats that were removed from the car Dulos was driving that day.\n\nHe has not been charged with killing or assaulting Jennifer. His girlfriend Michelle Troconis has also been charged with tampering with evidence. They have both pleaded not guilty and are free on bail.\n\nDulos insists that he had nothing to do with her disappearance.\n\nJennifer has been missing for five months now and the case has only become more and more fraught in court.\n\nIn a civil case Jennifer's mother Gloria Farber is seeking to get back the millions of dollars she alleges her late husband lent to Fotis for his business and their mortgage.\n\nLast week a judge ruled that her attorney would not be allowed to subpoena Pattis to provide the source of Fotis' attorney's feed.\n\nFurthermore, Farber's attorney Richard Weinstein also filed a new motion to depose Fotis' girlfriend Troconis to find out what role she had in Fotis' company the Fore Group.", "description": "Jennifer Dulos' family is denying her estranged husband Fotis Dulos' claim that she received medical treatment months after vanishing on May 24 after they filed the medical bill to court last week.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19764310-0-image-a-33_1571182384991.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
