That view factors into the impeachment investigation against him, as does his long obsession with the origins of the Russia inquiry.\n\nHouse Democrats are examining in part whether his pressure on Ukraine to open investigations into theories about the 2016 election constituted an abuse of power.\n\nThe move also creates an unusual situation in which the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into itself.\n\nBarr's reliance on Durham, a widely respected and veteran prosecutor who has investigated CIA torture and broken up Mafia rings, could help insulate the attorney general from accusations that he is doing the president's bidding and putting politics above justice.\n\nIt was not clear what potential crime Durham is investigating, nor when the criminal investigation was prompted. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSeeking vindication\n\nTrump is certain to see the criminal investigation as a vindication of the years he and his allies have spent trying to discredit the Russia investigation. In May, Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity that the FBI officials who opened the case \u2014 a counterintelligence investigation into whether his campaign conspired with Moscow's election sabotage \u2014 had committed treason.\n\n\"We can never allow these treasonous acts happen to another president,\" Trump said. He has called the FBI investigation one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal investigators need only a \"reasonable indication\" that a crime has been committed to open an investigation, a much lower standard than the probable cause required to obtain search warrants. However, \"there must be an objective, factual basis for initiating the investigation; a mere hunch is insufficient,\" according to Justice Department guidelines.\n\nWhen Barr appointed Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to lead the review, he had only the power to voluntarily question people and examine government files.\n\nBarr expressed scepticism of the Russia investigation even before joining the Trump administration. Weeks after being was sworn in this year, he said he intended to scrutinise how it started and used the term \"spying\" to describe investigators' surveillance of Trump campaign advisers. But he has been careful to say he wants to determine whether investigators acted lawfully.\n\n\"The question is whether it was adequately predicated,\" Barr told lawmakers in April. \"And I'm not suggesting that it wasn't adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.\"\n\nBarr began the administrative review of the Russia investigation in May, saying that he had conversations with intelligence and law enforcement officials that led him to believe that the FBI acted improperly, if not unlawfully.\n\nAustralian involvement\n\nThe FBI opened the investigation in late July 2016, code-named Crossfire Hurricane, after receiving information from the Australian government that a Trump campaign adviser had been approached with an offer of stolen emails that could damage Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nFBI agents discovered the offer shortly after stolen Democratic emails were released, and the events, along with ties between other Trump advisers and Russia, set off fears that the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia's interference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did not use information from the CIA in opening the Russia investigation, former U.S. officials said. But agents' views on Russia's election interference operation crystallised by mid-August, after the CIA director at the time, John Brennan, shared intelligence with Comey about it.\n\nThe CIA did contribute heavily to the intelligence community's assessment in early 2017 that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and tried to tip it in Trump's favour, and law enforcement officials later used those findings to bolster their application for a wiretap on a Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page.\n\nThe special counsel who took over the Russia investigation in 2017, Robert Mueller, secured convictions or guilty pleas from a handful of Trump associates and indictments of more than two dozen Russians on charges related to their wide-ranging interference scheme.\n\nFor all the hype around Robert Mueller's report into Russian involvement in US politics, it did not trigger an impeachment move against the President. Bloomberg\n\nIn his report, Mueller said that he had \"insufficient evidence\" to determine whether Trump or his aides engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians but that the campaign welcomed the sabotage and expected to benefit from it.\n\nBarr is closely managing the Durham investigation, even travelling to Italy to seek help from officials there to run down an unfounded conspiracy that is at the heart of conservatives' attacks on the Russia investigation \u2014 that the Italian government helped set up the Trump campaign adviser who was told in 2016 that the Russians had damaging information that could hurt Clinton's campaign.\n\nBut Italy's intelligence services told Barr that they played no such role in the events leading to the Russia investigation, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said in a news conference Wednesday. Barr has also contacted government officials in Britain and Australia about their roles in the early stages of the Russia investigation.\n\nRevelations so far about Durham's investigation have shown that he has focused in his first months on the accusations that Trump's conservative allies have made about the origins of the Russia inquiry in their efforts to undermine it. Durham's efforts have prompted criticism that he and Barr are trying to deliver the president a political victory, though investigators would typically run down all aspects of a case to complete a review of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurham is running the investigation with a trusted aide, Nora Dannehy, and a pair of retired FBI agents. Other prosecutors are also assisting, people familiar with the investigation said.\n\nIn interviewing more than two dozen former and current FBI and intelligence officials, Durham's investigators have asked about any anti-Trump bias among officials who worked on the Russia investigation and about one aspect of the investigation that was at the heart of highly contentious allegations that they abused their powers: the secret application seeking a court order for a wiretap on Page.\n\nLaw enforcement officials suspected Page was the target of recruitment by the Russian government, which he has denied.\n\nDurham has also asked whether CIA officials might have somehow tricked the FBI into opening the Russia investigation.\n\nDurham has indicated he wants to interview former officials who ran the CIA in 2016 but has yet to question either Brennan or James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence. Trump has repeatedly attacked them as part of a vast conspiracy by the so-called deep state to stop him from winning the presidency.\n\nSome CIA officials have retained criminal lawyers in anticipation of being interviewed. It was not clear whether Durham was scrutinising other former top intelligence officials. Admiral Michael Rogers, former director of the National Security Agency, declined to say whether he had spoken with Durham's investigators.\n\nDurham also has yet to question many of the former FBI officials involved in opening the Russia investigation.\n\nAs Durham's investigation moves forward, the Justice Department inspector general is wrapping up his own inquiry into aspects of the FBI's conduct in the early days of the Russia investigation. Among other things, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is scrutinising the application for a warrant to wiretap Page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarr has not said whether Durham's investigation grew out of the inspector general's findings or something that prosecutors unearthed while doing interviews or reviewing documents. But the inspector general's findings, which are expected to be made public in coming weeks, could contribute to the public's understanding of why Durham might want to investigate national security officials' activities in 2016.\n\nThough the inspector general's report deals with sensitive information, Horowitz anticipates that little of it will be blacked out when he releases the document publicly, he wrote in a letter sent to lawmakers on Thursday and obtained by The New York Times.\n\nDurham has delved before into the secret world of intelligence gathering during the Bush and Obama administrations. He was asked in 2008 to investigate why the CIA destroyed tapes depicting detainees being tortured. The next year, Attorney General Eric Holder appointed Durham to spearhead an investigation into the CIA abuses.\n\nCareer prosecutors had already examined many of the same cases and declined to bring charges, and in an echo of the Russia investigation, they fumed that Holder was revisiting the issue. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, then the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said that the abuses had been \"exhaustively reviewed\" and that a new inquiry could put national security at risk.\n\nAfter nearly four years, Durham's investigation ended with no charges against CIA officers, including two directly involved in the deaths of two detainees, angering human rights activists.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The investigation by US Attorney General William Barr could involve the Australian government, which tipped off the CIA about possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3158%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_12/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bbaa9fc3e18c1390fe01cc9cd4cc0c02fb8ba836", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
