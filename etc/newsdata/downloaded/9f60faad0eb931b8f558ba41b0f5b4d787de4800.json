I want to be clear, he (Young) is the former president.\"\n\nThe inspector general's review represents fresh embarrassment for an agency still reeling from the institutional failures cited in the suicide of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMore: Attorney General ousts head of federal prison system in aftermath of Jeffrey Epstein's death\n\nMore: 'Robbed of our day in court': Accusers rip 'coward' Jeffrey Epstein in court hearing Tuesday\n\nEpstein's death is the subject of at least three federal investigations, involving the FBI, the inspector general and the Bureau of Prisons. Among the areas of focus, authorities have been examining whether guards assigned to Epstein's unit may have slept through checks on the prisoner's cell in the hours before he was found dead, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe review of the guards' conduct also will include whether they appropriately accounted for their time on duty, said the person who is not authorized to comment publicly. Young, then prison union president, was vocal in defense of the membership, asserting that officers often worked double shifts because of persistent staff shortages.\n\nAt the time of his death, Epstein, 66, was awaiting trial following his indictment on charges of sex trafficking and sex-trafficking conspiracy. Federal prosecutors alleged that he \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes\" in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from 2002-2005.\n\nHe was found \"unresponsive in his cell\" in August at the federal detention in Manhattan and transported to nearby New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, who had been sharply critical of bureau operations following Epstein's suicide, did not wait for the results of the multiple internal investigations before naming new leadership at the agency, installing former director, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, to serve another term as the chief of the nation's largest prison system.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Federal prison official had sexual relationship with former union prez", "description": "The results of the internal review represents fresh embarrassment for an agency still reeling from the institutional failures cited in the suicide of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.", "authors": ["Kevin Johnson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eRYE.59gK8zNAZigCDU28w--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/b5cac2b8-19ea-4eb2-bbe6-6c2c8c1094fd/bf6d883e-2846-5ec1-a431-04b11bb53885/data_3_0.jpg?s=fb7104198cb53133baac848b3a47031f&c=623ad74a1bd05cbae5d0dcbdf80dd845&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
