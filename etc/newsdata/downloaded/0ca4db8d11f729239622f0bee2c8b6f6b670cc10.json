And in other instances in which his testimony isn\u2019t firsthand, Taylor helps outline a puzzle that others will probably be able to fill out.\n\nAD\n\nBelow, a few takeaways from Taylor\u2019s opening statement.\n\n1. There was a quid pro quo on military aid, he believes\n\nIn the text messages described above, Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador, asked Sept. 1 about hundreds of millions of dollars in withheld military aid: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d And on Sept. 9, he worried that \u201cit\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn his opening statement, Taylor said nothing has disabused him of that belief.\n\n\u201cI believed that then, and I still believe that,\u201d he said.\n\n2. But it wasn\u2019t the only one\n\nOne of the big questions here was whether Trump might have gotten leverage from a) withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid, or b) from withholding an Oval Office meeting that new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky badly wanted.\n\nAD\n\nTaylor said it\u2019s both.\n\n\u201cBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelenskyy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma,\u201d which employed Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, \u201cand alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe military aid was held up around the same time, but Taylor said it took him longer to reach the same conclusion about it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt still had not occurred to me that the hold on security assistance could be related to the \u2018investigation,'\" he said, describing where things stood in late August when the withheld military aid was first reported. \u201cThat, however, would soon change.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n3. An explicit quid pro quo \u2014 explicitly relayed to Ukraine\n\nTaylor provides perhaps the most compelling evidence yet that this quid pro quo didn\u2019t just exist but was explicitly communicated to Ukraine. He said he was told by National Security Council aide Tim Morrison that Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, directly communicated that quid pro quo to a top Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak.\n\n\u201cDuring this same phone call I had with Mr. Morrison, he went on to describe a conversation Ambassador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak at [a meeting in] Warsaw,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAmbassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d (Zelenskyy, the spelling used by Taylor in his written remarks, is the preferred spelling in Ukraine.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s about as explicit as it gets \u2014 although it\u2019s secondhand. It appears Morrison\u2019s testimony will now be key.\n\nTaylor also said Sondland later told him directly that both a meeting and military aid depended on the investigations.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelenskyy was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelenskyy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney last week appeared to confirm a quid pro quo \u2014 saying the aid was held up in part because Ukraine declined to investigate a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election that Trump favors. He soon tried to clean that up, saying Trump was merely concerned about corruption more broadly.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has also described such an arrangement on the 2016 investigation, saying Trump told him about it in an Aug. 31 phone call.\n\n\u201cBut the president was very consistent on why he was considering [holding up the aid],\" Johnson said this month. \u201cAgain, it was corruption, overall, generalized \u2014 but yeah, no doubt about it, what happened in 2016 \u2014 what happened in 2016, as relates? What was the truth about that?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJohnson has also said Sondland told him at the time that the aid was tied to the investigation involving 2016 election interference, which Trump would apparently like to use to undercut the idea that Russia was behind it.\n\n4. Sondland has explaining to do\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee are talking about bringing Sondland back for more questioning, apparently believing he wasn\u2019t forthcoming with them.\n\nAD\n\nSondland testified last week, for instance, that he wasn\u2019t able to vouch for the lack of a quid pro quo. But Taylor suggests he was directly involved in communicating one. Taylor suggests Sondland tried to put a good face on it \u2014 and that Trump and Sondland took care to say it wasn\u2019t a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 but that that\u2019s what it effectively was.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelenskyy and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelenskyy did not \u2018clear things up\u2019 in public, we would be at a \u2018stalemate,'\" Taylor said of his Sept. 8 phone call with Sondland. \u201cI understood a \u2018stalemate\u2019 to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance.\u201d\n\nSondland also said testified last week that \u201cI recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Taylor described Sondland relaying a direct request involving the Bidens to Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\n5. More cloak-and-dagger\n\nTaylor doesn\u2019t just describe quid pro quos; he describes the kind of secrecy we\u2019ve come to expect from the Ukraine saga.\n\nHe says on a June 28 call with the \u201cthree amigos\u201d \u2014 Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 Sondland said he wanted to prevent records of their upcoming call with Zelensky. He says Volker said on the call that he was going to make the White House demands to Zelensky explicit.\n\n\u201cI sense something odd when Ambassador Sondland told me on June 28 that he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants in a call planned with President Zelenskyy later that day,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cAmbassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and I were on this call, dialing in from different locations. However, Ambassador Sondland said that he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added President Zelenskyy to the call.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTaylor also says he was given no rundown of what Trump spoke about with Zelensky in their July 25 call, the rough transcript of which showed Trump requesting the two investigations.\n\n\u201cStrangely, even though I was the Chief of Mission and was scheduled to meet with President Zelenskyy along with Ambassador Volker the following day, I received no readout of the call from the White House,\u201d he says.\n\nThe whistleblower who touched off this whole thing has alleged that the call between Trump and Zelensky was stored on a code-word-level computer system that is generally reserved for sensitive national security information.\n\nSondland also encouraged Taylor in their texts, after Taylor raised concerns about quid pro quos, to speak with him on the phone. Sondland has denied he was trying to avoid a written record of their conversation, saying that\u2019s generally how he conducts business.", "description": "Pretty much everything we thought was a quid pro quo was in fact a quid pro quo, the acting ambassador to Ukraine testified Tuesday.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hOooVbYvDo11Tvy-8kAaUppxgnY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/26MEGBXU3YI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
