REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nCarrefour veteran Thierry Garnier is due to succeed V\u00e9ronique Laury as CEO of Kingfisher, whose main businesses are B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, on Sept. 25.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no handcuffs on Thierry\u2019s arrival into the company, he\u2019ll take his own independent view of all moving parts of the business,\u201d chairman Andy Cosslett told reporters when asked about the possibility of breaking up the group.\n\nKingfisher is in the fourth year of a five-year programme that was designed to boost earnings. However, profits reversed in 2018-19 and the group said in March it would part company with Laury, who has been its CEO since 2014.\n\nAlthough Cosslett said the board was not \u201ciron clad\u201d on Kingfisher\u2019s current structure, it believed \u201cthat the current composition of the group\u201d gave it the scale it needed.\n\nKingfisher, which trades from more than 1,300 stores in 10 countries across Europe, including Poland and Romania, said in November last year that it would pull out of Russia, Spain and Portugal.\n\nA 6.4% fall in first half profit at Kingfisher underlined the task Garnier faces, particularly in France, where like-for-like sales fell 4.4%, and at B&Q, where they were down 3.2%.\n\nLaury\u2019s strategy, costing 800 million pounds over five years, involves unifying product ranges across brands, boosting e-commerce and seeking efficiency savings.\n\nRelated Coverage New Kingfisher CEO will not be handcuffed on strategy-chairman\n\nVULNERABLE\n\nKingfisher shares were down 2.7% at 0943 GMT, extending losses for the year to 26% which some analysts believe makes it vulnerable to a possible private equity bid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not happy where the share price is but we think through our own efforts we can get that moving quite quickly once we start delivering better performance through execution,\u201d Cosslett said.\n\nKingfisher said it made an underlying pretax profit of 353 million pounds in the six months to July 31.\n\nWhile ahead of analysts\u2019 average forecast of 342 million pounds, it was down from 377 million pounds made in the same period last year.\n\nTotal sales fell 0.9% on a constant currency basis to 6 billion pounds. Like-for-like sales were down 1.8%, with growth in Screwfix, Poland and Romania offset by B&Q and France.\n\nKingfisher said its outlook by geography remained mixed, highlighting continued uncertainty around UK consumer demand ahead of Britain\u2019s planned European Union exit.\n\n\u201cFor bigger ticket items I think there\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety about what the future immediately holds,\u201d said the chairman.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Large bags of sand for sale are seen at a Castorama improvement store, operated by Kingfisher in Ezanville near Paris, France March 21, 2019. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nKingfisher maintained its forecast for a flat gross margin for the full 2019-20 year.\n\nPrior to Wednesday\u2019s update analysts were on average forecasting a 2019-20 underlying pretax profit of 658 million pounds, down from 693 million pounds made in 2018-19.", "description": "Britain's Kingfisher will give its new chief executive free rein to pursue whatever strategy he decides, even a possible break-up of the home improvement retailer, which has struggled to lift its earnings.", "authors": ["James Davey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431192182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0QI", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
