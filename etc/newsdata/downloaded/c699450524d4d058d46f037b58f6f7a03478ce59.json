Here are a few post-fight musings \u2026\n\n* * * * *\n\n1. Israel Adesanya\u2019s perfect night\n\nWhen it comes to delivering in a big spot, Israel Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) did about as well as anyone with a star-making performance to become undisputed UFC middleweight champion.\n\nAdesanya handled everything from the start of fight week to its end with a stunning level of perfection. He said the right things in the media pre-fight, had a walkout for the ages, fought almost perfectly to dethrone Robert Whittaker in front of a record crowd and effectively garnered interest in his first title defense, likely to come against Paulo Costa.\n\nIt was A+ work all around from \u201cThe Last Stylebender,\u201d and for someone who made his UFC debut less than two years ago, Adesanya\u2019s rise has been something special to watch. There\u2019s nothing but difficult fights ahead for him, though, and with the belt now in his possession, it remains to be seen how many more times Adesanya can achieve perfection.", "description": "Post-fight thoughts and analysis of what mattered most at UFC 243 in Melbourne, Australia.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ufc-243_-israel-adesanya-post-fight-shrug.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
