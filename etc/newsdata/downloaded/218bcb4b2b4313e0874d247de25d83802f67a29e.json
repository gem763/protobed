After the thrill of 2016, anything short of a dynasty felt like a disappointment, fairly or not. The 2017 Cubs won 92 games and advanced to a third consecutive National League Championship Series\u2014yet the dominant narrative was that the Cubs had suffered from a \u201cchampionship hangover.\u201d 2018 was similar: The Cubs won 95 games, tied for most in the National League, but abruptly ended their season with back-to-back losses in the divisional tiebreaker and Wild Card games. Epstein declared that the team\u2019s offense \u201cbroke\u201d and announced that Maddon would manage the final season of his contract without an extension.\n\nBy then, Maddon had become the preferred target for Cubs fans\u2019 frustrations and media second-guessing. His reputation as a \u201cplayers\u2019 coach,\u201d once his greatest strength, was recast as a liability, especially when several of the Cubs\u2019 no longer quite-so-young players stalled or regressed in their development. The 2019 Cubs reinforced that narrative, producing results that were \u201cless than the sum of the parts\u201d of their roster. (A manager certainly deserves some blame for such extreme inconsistency, but other factors were beyond Maddon\u2019s control: poor free-agency decisions by the front office, a key veteran\u2019s months-long personal leave, a rash of post-All Star break injuries suffered by star players.) Despite the struggles, the Cubs stayed in contention for a fifth-straight postseason berth\u2014until a brutal nine-game September losing streak knocked them out of the playoff race and sealed Maddon\u2019s fate.\n\nIn their joint press conference on the season\u2019s last day, Maddon and Epstein each spoke at length about change as an organizational positive. There is surely truth to those sentiments, as there is to the rationale that the personality and skill set that made Maddon such an ideal fit for a young, unproven squad is not necessarily the best fit for managing the 2020 Cubs. Moving on was a logical decision, consistent with recent prevailing wisdom that teams should move on from even highly successful managers in the face of disappointment.\n\nBut the change likely won\u2019t pay off. Maddon may not have been flawless, but he was remarkably successful: The Cubs ranked third in the MLB in wins during his tenure. Cubs players effusively praised Maddon and appeared genuinely saddened after his departure became official. And, while he surely made mistakes, the man who was regarded as a brilliant tactician for the first decade of his career did not suddenly get dumber in the last three years. Tellingly, Epstein\u2019s press-conference prediction that there would be a \u201cbidding war\u201d for Maddon appears accurate, with multiple teams reportedly interested in hiring him to replace their own recently fired managers.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein and the Cubs must now decide who has the strategic and interpersonal skills to step into Maddon\u2019s enormous shoes. At best, it seems the Cubs will be making an educated guess: Of the five candidates identified publicly to date, four have never managed before, and the fifth (Joe Girardi, late of the Yankees) was let go from his last job based on concerns about his ability to \u201ccommunicate and connect with\u201d players. Regardless of who the Cubs select to replace Maddon, he is unlikely to succeed\u2014at least if the only definition of success is to deliver another championship banner to Chicago. As the Cubs and their fans should know better than anyone, winning the World Series is incredibly difficult. Sometimes it takes 108 years.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
