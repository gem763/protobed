Their inability to create a turnover. Their failure to score in the first half, or prevent opponents from jumping out to big leads.\n\nThen they faced the division-rival Eagles on Sunday night to battle for the NFC East lead. The struggling Cowboys of the three-game losing skid were long gone. Instead, three different Dallas defenders snatched three fumble recoveries, which three different offensive players converted for three rushing touchdowns. The complementary football powered the Cowboys to a 37-10 statement win that improves their record to 4-3, good enough for first place in the division.\n\nNo, this isn\u2019t the statement win to fuel Cowboys postseason speculation. But for a team that fell to the Jets last week, the Cowboys compiling their most complete game of the season sends them into the bye week on a far different note than they would have faced had they lost a fourth straight.\n\nHere are three things we learned in the win:\n\n1. Cowboys D backs up trash talk\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence was the lone Cowboy to bite back after Eagles coach Doug Pederson said his team would win at Dallas.\n\n\u201cTell him to come on,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nFrom the first offensive series, the defense was. Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz found tight end Dallas Goedert on an 8-yard dart up the middle 1 minute and 42 seconds into the game. But as Goedert turned downfield, he came face to face with Cowboys linebackers Jaylon Smith and Leighton Vander Esch. Smith stripped Goedert on his way down. Defensive tackle Maliek Collins dove for the recovery to set up the Cowboys offense at Philly\u2019s 45, the team\u2019s first offensive drive of 2019 to begin from opponent territory. Dallas capitalized with a 20-yard Tavon Austin touchdown run. It did so again when Lawrence strip-sacked Wentz on the next drive. After scoring 3 points in the first half the last three games combined, Dallas set the game\u2019s tone early with 14.\n\n2. Dak Prescott to Amari Cooper: Very good\n\nA week after Cooper missed the Jets game with a quad bruise, he was questionable entering the Eagles game. Sunday night, Cooper was active. Prescott and Cooper connected on all five targets to the tune of 106 yards. Prescott found his No. 1 receiver for a 44-yard pass down the left sideline in the second quarter and 28 yards down the right sideline to open the fourth quarter.\n\nHere\u2019s Amari with the diving catch. Sets up Brett Maher 29-yard FG\n\n\n\nCowboys 30, Eagles 10\n\n\n\n(\ud83d\udcf9: @thecheckdown)pic.twitter.com/a5ECEGmANh \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 21, 2019\n\nThe latter pass came on the play immediately succeeding Prescott tangling with Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins. Prescott completed 21 of 27 passes for 239 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He also rushed for 30 yards and a touchdown on five carries. His 21st career rushing score broke Roger Staubach\u2019s record for Cowboys QBs.\n\nDak Prescott and Malcolm Jenkins tiff \ud83d\ude33\n\n\n\nNext play: Dak finds Cowboys WR Amari Cooper for 28 yards\n\n\n\n(\ud83d\udcf9: @_joeyhayden)pic.twitter.com/2uWpo4vp22 \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 21, 2019\n\n3. Brett Maher among record-breakers\n\nDon\u2019t forget kicker Maher on any list of record breakers. His 63-yard field goal wasn\u2019t just the longest in franchise history. He also became the first player in NFL history to convert three kicks of 60 or longer, and two above 60 in consecutive games. His three-of-three day extended the Cowboys lead to 37-10.\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.", "description": "The Dallas Cowboys snapped out of a three-game losing skid to claim sole possession of first in the NFC East by blasting the Philadelphia Eagles.", "authors": ["Jori Epstein", "Published P.M.
