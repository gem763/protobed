USA TODAY\n\nIf someone you know is living with mental illness, reaching out can make an immense impact. It could even save a life.\n\nChecking in on them can be as simple as a phone call, a text message or a ping on Facebook Messenger.\n\nOn Thursday, which is World Mental Health Day, the nation's most popular social networking site launched a camera filter called \"Let's Talk,\" to help facilitate tough conversations surrounding mental wellness.\n\nFacebook said it worked with the World Health Organization to develop the filter that lets your close connections know you're open to chatting when they need it.\n\n\u201cMuch work has been done to destigmatize mental health on social media, but we know not everyone is comfortable sharing personal feelings publicly,\" said Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety.\n\nSnapchat rival: Instagram launched 'Threads,' a messaging app to house your intimate conversations\n\n'What happened to all my Likes?': Facebook launches a test to hide them.\n\nFacebook wants to destigmatize mental health by rolling out a filter and set of stickers that encourage people to reach out for support.

So, Facebook is also rolling out a set of stickers \"that can help take the place of words when they are hard to find.\"\n\nThe stickers get the conversation started with messages such as \"Let's talk,\" \"Listening,\" \"Feeling Alone,\" and \"You are not alone.\" There's also a sticker that symbolizes giving or receiving a digital hug.\n\nNew Facebook sticker.

Other studies suggest that screen time and depression may be intertwined.\n\nStill, Facebook will donate $1 to a select group of mental health organizations around the world, up to $1 million, every time one of its new stickers is sent. \"We\u2019re thrilled to support our partners in the mental health space, many of whom we have longstanding relationships with and rely on to help develop our policies and resources,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe social networking giant also offers guidance for users who see someone posting suicidal or self-injury related content.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/10/facebook-rolls-out-suite-new-stickers-world-mental-health-day/3917681002/", "description": "Facebook says its new filter \"acts as an invitation for close connections who might be struggling to reach out for support via Messenger.\"", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
