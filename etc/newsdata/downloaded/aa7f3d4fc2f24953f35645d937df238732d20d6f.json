For Mac and PC from November 15, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from December 17.\n\nSecret Neighbor\n\n\n\n[Launch Trailer: youtu.be/J5QIIQpnq08]\n\nPrevious game \"Hello Neighbor\" had players sneaking into a neighbor's house to find out the secrets of his basement. This one offers a clever twist -- you're one of six players doing the same, but this time one among your number is picking off everyone else as the Neighbor in disguise! Out now on PC (Steam, Xbox Store), Xbox One and Xbox Game Pass.\n\nTangle Tower\n\n\n\n[Release Trailer: youtu.be/3JEliSJ859I]\n\nVenture into this strange mystery and work out how a painted portrait ended up the prime suspect in a batty murder case, if such a thing is possible even in this surprising wonder. From the team behind \"Detective Grimoire\" (hence the similar quality of presentation). Out now for iOS (Apple Arcade), PC (Steam), and Nintendo Switch.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Sword & Shield\n\n\n\n[A new era of Pok\u00e9mon begins: youtu.be/UMjKiC1l_yA]\n\nThis quick and intense blast of nostalgia and low-key video game tech history is even odder in an age of \"Pok\u00e9mon Go,\" where mobile devices literally superimpose Pok\u00e9mon franchise creatures onto real-world backgrounds. Here, though, it's in service of emphasizing improvements in graphical wizardry over the course of the franchise's two-decade term, ahead of \"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\" releasing for Nintendo Switch on November 15.\n\nMoons of Madness\n\n\n\n[Launch Trailer: youtu.be/8RPGUHMrjE0]\n\nCosmic horror overshadows a Mars research outpost, which has been collecting signals from some sort of intelligent life form, and an isolated engineer tries to survive long enough to find out what is really going on. Out now on PC, launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2020.", "description": "Venture into this strange mystery and work out how a painted portrait ended up the prime suspect in a batty murder case, if such a thing is possible even in this surprising wonder.
