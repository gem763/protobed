They're voting with their feet.\n\n\"I think the status of a named degree will last for some time but increasingly employers will say 'just tell us what your education has been'.\"\n\nDr Shergold agreed there were serious inequities on fees with most basic training courses not attracting any fee subsidy, whereas university students could switch on a concessional loan whenever they wanted.\n\nThere should be a better explanation to final-year students that doing an apprenticeship meant not only they got paid to study but got a qualification without a HECS debt.\n\n\"I don't know what is the behavioural economics of how you make those choices. At one level you could make a strong argument that it's very attractive to be an apprentice.\"\n\nDr Shergold spoke to The Australian Financial Review after the controversial interim report into the NSW curriculum was published. This was hailed by Premier Gladys Berejiklian as going \"back to basics\". But its author, Geoff Masters, said his proposed changes \"preference deeper conceptual understanding over shallower coverage of extensive factual and procedural detail\".\n\nProfessor Masters expressed misgivings about the ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank), which he said was an inadequate measure of 13 years of schooling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A long-term reform agenda for the senior years of school will be a curriculum less focused on the sometimes narrow needs of particular post-school destinations and more focused on providing every student with the broad knowledge, skills and attributes they for learning, life and work,\" he wrote.\n\nDr Shergold said more and more ministers and senior bureaucrats were expressing concern about the ATAR.\n\nProfessor Shergold said ATAR was in the target zone for reform but he was not sure if it should be ditched altogether. Peter Rae\n\n\"It is a very curious way in a single score of assessing the capability of someone leaving school.\n\n\"We are the only country which uses a single number queuing device. It was designed when there was greater demand for access to university.\"\n\nATAR was in the target zone for reform but he was not sure if it should be ditched altogether. But an increasingly number of universities were saying they would not rely on ATAR.\n\nThe Noonan Review of the Australian Qualifications Framework was released late in the week, proposing a simplified system of degrees and greater harmonisation of training and university.\n\nAuthor Peter Noonan said qualifications in future should be measured in hours studied, not years, and should be compiled by students depending on their needs.\n\nDr Shergold, a former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said his review came in the middle of a large number of school and post-school reviews. He described it as an area in which a lot of issues were overlapping.\n\n\"I would prefer that when people leave school, perhaps with a leaving certificate and in that or alongside it a much greater profile of the 'learnings' that they had taken inside the classroom and outside. I like the idea of a learning profile.\"", "description": "Break with the distinction between university and training and let students choose their own path.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3062%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_777%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0bf59e75b90d726de50133ab33850d2e7b0c6e15", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
