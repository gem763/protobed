Officials believe that the baby elephant had drowned and the five adults, found in a ravine below the baby, fell trying to reach it.\n\nThis photo by Thai News Pix taken on October 5, 2019 shows two elephants (one behind the other) trapped on a small cliff at a waterfall at Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand as rescuers work to save them.

The park is home to an estimated 300 elephants, the news agency reported.\n\nAsian elephants are classified as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\n\nThe surviving elephants will likely experience grief. When two elephants died earlier this year at an Indianapolis Zoo, officials confirmed that the rest of the herd reacted emotionally.\n\n\"This is probably just as difficult for our elephants. We know that elephants grieve. They are intensely social,\" Indianapolis Zoo President Rob Shumaker said at the time.\n\nContributing: Joel Shannon and The Associated Press.
