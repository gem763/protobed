The Y/Y rose to 1.7% as was forecast but on the whole it seems that there has not been much change in inflationary pressures.\n\nAs has been the case for the past week or so, markets remain highly sensitive to Brexit headlines with several scheduled events throughout the day possible catalysts for sharp moves.\n\nThis afternoon Barnier is set to brief EU ambassadors before Boris Johnson chairs a cabinet meeting and addresses the 1922 committee. At the moment we\u2019re seeing pretty wild swings several times a day as comments from either side hit the news and this will likely continue into the weekend - and possibly beyond.\n\nThe tone of the latest remarks has been a little bit less optimistic on the whole with concerns growing that even if a deal can be reached it may not pass through parliament. While the latest Brexit situation remains in a state of flux, markets overall seem to remain fairly hopeful that a deal can not only be reached but also pass through parliament, with the pound trading not far from the 5-month high made against the US dollar just yesterday.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by XTB (David Cheetham) covering: .
