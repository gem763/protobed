Once upon a time, that description would stand tall without qualifiers.\n\nThat\u2019s no longer the case.\n\nSwift must be much more in today\u2019s hyper-political climate. The singer resisted that urge until she finally spoke out on issues with no ties to her skill set.\n\nNow?\n\nShe epitomizes everything that\u2019s wrong with celebrity culture. Let\u2019s count the ways.\n\nRELATED: Media Goes Full Racist in Attacks on Taylor Swift\n\nIt all stars with Swift keeping silent during the 2016 presidential campaign. Chances are her legion of fans didn\u2019t demand she take sides in the race for the White House. The mainstream media, by stark comparison, blew a collective gasket.\n\nWhy won\u2019t she take a stand, they cried in near unison, as if she were the preeminent political scientist of our times, not a chipper pop goddess.\n\nOf course, what the biased press actually meant was, \u201cwhy won\u2019t she endorse Hillary Clinton?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to read between the lines. Heck, The Daily Beast once spelled it out for readers.\n\nThe country crossover phenomenon has spent her extremely successful career trying to figure how a star in the social media age can stand for absolutely nothing. And that\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. A-listers have been dragged for their inability to hashtag Black Lives Matter and for their MAGA hats. On the other end of the spectrum, stars are often celebrated for throwing fundraising concerts for progressive candidates or teaming up with Bernie Sanders on Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s not as overt an admission of bias as that leaked New York Times confab, but it\u2019s close.\n\nHow absurd did the press attacks get? Consider this: One of the most insane media narratives before Trump suggested Swift was part of the Alt-Right, or at least that group\u2019s enabler.\n\nLast year, Swift finally relented. She endorsed two Democratic candidates and vowed to use her voice for something beyond her day job. In recent weeks, Swift turned up the volume. She kicked off a firestorm with the release of her music video for \u201cYou Need to Calm Down.\u201d\n\nThe pro-LGBT video, and its accompanying lyrics, did the opposite. Red State fans recoiled at the nasty stereotypes showcased in the clip. Progressives were even colder, complaining the video proved \u201cproblematic.\u201d\n\nMore specifically?\n\nShe hijacked queerness, they cried. Literally.\n\nThat\u2019s just part of the problem with Taylor Swift 2.0, and why the new model brings out the worst in the culture. Her latest comments are her own fault, but partly ours for caring in the first place.\n\nShe recently said she stayed out of the 2016 presidential race because Donald Trump was weaponizing celebrity endorsements. Had she been \u201cwith Her\u201d he would have used it against Hillary Clinton, or so Trump\u2019s 4D chess play went.\n\nHer most recent interview reveals multiple new excuses for not speaking out. She says she stayed out of the fray because she was going through a rough time, personally.\n\n\u201cIt became really terrifying for anyone to even know where I was. And I felt completely incapable of doing or saying anything publicly, at all. Even about my music. I always said I wouldn\u2019t talk about what was happening personally, because that was a personal time.\u201d She won\u2019t get into specifics. \u201cI just need some things that are mine,\u201d she despairs. \u201cJust some things.\u201d\n\nLater, she says coming from the country music realm taught her to steer clear of politics. Remember those Dixie Chicks?\n\nBut wait \u2026 there\u2019s even more excuses.\n\n\u201cAnd then, you know, if there was a time for me to get involved\u2026\u201d Swift pauses. \u201cThe worst part of the timing of what happened in 2016 was I felt completely voiceless. I just felt like, oh God, who would want me? Honestly.\u201d She would otherwise have endorsed Hillary Clinton? \u201cOf course,\u201d she says sincerely. \u201cI just felt completely, ugh, just useless. And maybe even like a hindrance.\u201d\n\nWell, which story is it? This pop superstar doesn\u2019t even know herself. And why should we care about her political views again, given her own confusion?\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nSwift\u2019s political conversations to date have been, and this is being kind, underwhelming. She sounds like an MSNBC guest the producers decide not to have back on mid-appearance. Here\u2019s one example:\n\n\u201cThe things that happen to you in your life are what develop your political opinions. I was living in this Obama eight-year paradise of, you go, you cast your vote, the person you vote for wins, everyone\u2019s happy!\u201d she says. \u201cThis whole thing, the last three, four years, it completely blindsided a lot of us, me included.\u201d\n\nIs she 29 or, like 14? Does she realize how the country works? Sometimes your politician wins \u2026 sometimes he or she loses. Grow up.\n\nA second Guardian feature on Swift finds her even more befuddled about the state of the nation. It starts, of course, with Trump-bashing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a democracy \u2013 at least, we\u2019re supposed to be \u2013 where you\u2019re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate. I really think that [Trump] thinks this is an autocracy.\u201d\n\nWhat country is Swift currently living in? The Left is out to stifle speech across the nation. State the \u201cwrong\u201d opinion, like three-year-olds shouldn\u2019t decide their gender, and you get forced into an apology tour. Share a libertarian thought on any Big Tech platform and you risk getting shadow banned, suspended or booted off, permanently.\n\nGive a conservative talk on a university campus and you better duck. Every other week the Left insists a Fox News personality must be kicked off the air.\n\nThe Left\u2019s war on open debate is no secret, but perhaps it hasn\u2019t pierced Swift\u2019s celebrity bubble. That\u2019s fine. Let her marinate in her cultural ignorance.\n\nRELATED: \u2018Hot Air\u2019 Is the Left\u2019s Latest Attack on Free Speech\n\nIt still brings back the same question. Why should anyone care about her political views?\n\nShe\u2019s allowed to have them, to share them, to write checks on their behalf. Who thinks they deserve more weight than that? Some progressive stars can be eloquent about the causes they espouse. She hardly qualifies, at least not yet.\n\nThere\u2019s another toxic side to Swift\u2019s political awakening, and it hits closer to home. Swift\u2019s father, Scott Swift, took down his Facebook page after users discovered, gasp, right-leaning content on it.\n\nBut before Scott\u2019s Facebook was deleted, screenshots were taken of what were claimed to be political posts including right-leaning memes about immigration and one refusing to acknowledge Elizabeth Warren as a Senator.\n\nThe Daily Mail says it reached out to the singer for comment but got no response.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t Swift defend her own father? Why couldn\u2019t he hold political views that differ from hers? So much for that whole \u201cdisagree, debate, dissent\u201d routine.\n\nPut it all together, and Taylor Swift 2.0 remains a golden-tressed superstar with a penchant for catchy, chart-busting tunes.
