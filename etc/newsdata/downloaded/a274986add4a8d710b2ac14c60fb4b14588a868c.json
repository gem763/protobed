(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is set to decide where the official interest rate will go on Tuesday, after cutting rates in June and July.\n\nThe vast majority of Australian economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe that the RBA will keep it on hold in September before cutting either in October or November.\n\nRegardless of some divergence on timing, nearly all believe rates are headed far lower at some point, with many currently expecting them to find a floor at 0.5% early next year.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is, for the first time in years, on a rate-cutting path.\n\nHaving slashed twice consecutively in June and July, it held the official interest rate at 1.0% in August.\n\nOn Tuesday, the central bank will make its decision as to where rates are going in September.\n\nIf economists\u2019 forecasts are anything to go by, it will likely keep the rate on hold once again while it waits for more economic data to land in the coming weeks.\n\nOf the 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, 27 agreed that rates would be left where they are.\n\nEconomists see only one way forward: down (Bloomberg)\n\nNotably, Market Economics\u2019 Stephen Koukoulas \u2014 who has previously called out RBA governor Philip Lowe for dragging his feet \u2014 is expecting or at least hoping the RBA will cut.\n\nRBA rate cut tomorrow? Mad if they don\u2019t. \u2014 Stephen Koukoulas (@TheKouk) September 2, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s joined by banks Barclays and Deutsche Bank, as well as brokerage Morgans, in calling a September rate cut.\n\nThe consensus, however, becomes much more divided as we head into the pointy end of the year, and rate cuts are expected to be almost inevitable.\n\nSeven currently expect a cut in October, but that number could quickly grow to 11 if there\u2019s no cut in September, and higher if the Australian economy weakens further.\n\nNotably, that October group includes two of Australia\u2019s big four banks \u2014 Westpac\u2019s Bill Evans and ANZ\u2019s Richard Yetsenga \u2014 as well as AMP\u2019s Shane Oliver.\n\nOliver tweeted however that he believes that a surprise cut in September is still a possibility.\n\n\u201cI think its a very close call and it would not surprise me if they do cut,\u201d he said.\n\nConsensus of economists seeing no rate cuts next week (although I think its a very close call and it would not surprise me if they do cut), but more cuts ahead.#ausecon pic.twitter.com/qOn8eo8C6c \u2014 Shane Oliver (@ShaneOliverAMP) August 30, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, 18 economists expect a cut in November. If a cut doesn\u2019t happen in the two preceding months however, that will quickly become the consensus view.\n\nWith the RBA already laying the runway for rates to approach zero, most economists surveyed point to interest rates falling to around 0.5% by the beginning of 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: The RBA could re-inflate a housing bubble with threats to cut interest rates further, economists warn\n\nThat\u2019s despite the RBA itself talking down the benefit cuts will have on the Australian economy.\n\nOnly exchange-traded funds provider Betashares expect them to be hiked at all during the next year, with most believing they\u2019ll stay stuck at basement levels for a full 12-months pending any major change to the Australian economy.\n\nWhile many of their views differ in some respect, the idea of rates being cut and kept low looks all but guaranteed.\n\nREAD MORE: The RBA is now considering the drastic measure of negative interest rates\u2014 meaning you could be paid to borrow money from the bank\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
