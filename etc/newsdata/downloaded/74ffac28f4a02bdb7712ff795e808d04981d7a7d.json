The person, a Penn State graduate, acknowledged writing the letter in an interview with The Tribune-Democrat on Tuesday. The letter said Sutherland's shoulder-length dreadlocks looked \"disgusting.\"\n\nFranklin addressed the letter indirectly. He said, \"The football that I know and love brings people together and embraces differences.\" The coach complimented Sutherland for being \"the ultimate example of what our program's about.\"\n\nSutherland posted on Twitter that the message was \"ignorant,\" but said he forgave the sender without an apology necessary.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
