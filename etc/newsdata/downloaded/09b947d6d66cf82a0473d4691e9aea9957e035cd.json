Pompeo warns Congress against \u2018HARASSING\u2019 his employees over Trump impeachment probe", "language": "en", "text": "Mike Pompeo says the State Department will cooperate with a congressional probe seeking the impeachment of Donald Trump \u2013 but he will not allow his employees to be coerced into leaking documents as part of a \u201csilly gotcha game.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nPompeo said on Saturday that his department had responded in writing to a congressional request for documents linked to the probe into whether US President Donald Trump tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate the son of a top political rival, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWe will obviously do all the things we are required to by law,\u201d Pompeo said on Saturday. However, he insisted that there were \u201cclearly politics\u201d involved in the Democrats\u2019 probe, and vowed to protect his colleagues from any improper tactics that might be used by lawmakers.\n\nPompeo noted that there had been congressional inquiries in the past that tried to contact State Department employees directly, in the hopes that they would provide documents and records.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s harassment and I will never let that happen to my people,\u201d he warned.\n\nLater in the day, Pompeo was even more bristling when responding to yet another question on Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky, and the \u201cred flags\u201d during his visit to Greece.\n\nThis is what\u2019s wrong when the world doesn\u2019t focus on the things that are right, the things that matter, the things that impact real people\u2019s lives, and instead you get caught up in some silly gotcha game.\n\nRead more\n\nDemocrats claim that a series of messages and phone calls involving Trump and various members of his administration prove that the president tried to extort political favors from Kiev. However, House Republicans in turn insist that testimony from former US special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, \u201cdirectly undermines\u201d the Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-California) has so far refused to release a transcript of Volker\u2019s testimony \u2013 a decision which some have interpreted as evidence that the Ukraine probe is another nothingburger similar to the now-debunked Russiagate.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
