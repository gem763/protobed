We believe that a better pipeline of supply, especially within the gap market, will go a long way to improving home ownership in our country,\u201d Mhlongo said.\n\nMhlongo said emigration and relocation-related sales remain low in affordable housing bracket but is more prominent in higher price segments.\n\nThe FNB Affordable Housing Insight was compiled through surveys with the country\u2019s top real estate agencies in Gauteng, Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.", "description": "FNB said there is a lack of supply in the 'cheaper' market which leads to strong house price growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9350/d1c5e7f1bd1c4b0f93466301065d3406.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
