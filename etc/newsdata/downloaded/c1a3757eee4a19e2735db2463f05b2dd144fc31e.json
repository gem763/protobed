Pleased with the civil Canadian greeting and abundant bison he settled his Lakota followers in the rolling hills and short-grass prairies of southwest Saskatchewan. The bison were gone after four years \u2014 felled by hide hunters and overhunting to make room for European settlers \u2014 and U.S. government representatives convinced Chief Sitting Bull to move to a South Dakota reserve.\n\nNot everyone followed Sitting Bull back to the U.S. Descendants of the Lakota can still be found in the area surrounding Canada\u2019s Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan, a historic connection that surprises the hardy 12,000 travelers that visit the remote park each year.\n\nBut there is much to be surprised about in one of Canada\u2019s newest national parks, created in 1981. I started my explorations with a time-travel-themed hike in the park\u2019s east block, one of the best places in the world to see the line of extinction, a geological punctuation mark on the age of dinosaurs.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

Quicksand, venomous snakes, and cantankerous bison remind you this is a park that can hurt you but it\u2019s worth the risk to hike across grasslands bereft of fences or buildings or wander coulees with some of Canada\u2019s richest dinosaur beds\u2014a new prehistoric bird species was found here only eight years ago. The only towns you\u2019ll see are occupied by prairie dogs and when the sun sets on the darkest of Canada\u2019s dark sky preserves, you\u2019ll be gobsmacked by ribbons of stars draped across the sky.\n\nIt\u2019s a five-hour-drive from the nearest airport and the road potholes will resettle your fillings.\n\nNobody just drops in. You have to want to be here.\n\nMy guide, Corelie Keller, is no exception. Finding her fortune in the oil industry she returned home to care for her mother on the century-old family farm. Now she has channeled her communication skills and love of the rolling hills into a seasonal gig interpreting Grasslands National Parks.\n\n\u201cDo you have pliers with you?\u201d she queried a woman with a small dog, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cactus out there.\u201d At the bewildered look passed between dog lover and her human companion, Keller stepped back into the Parks Canada office, emerging shortly after with leather gloves and a pair of pliers poking out of her back pocket.\n\nCresting a grassy knoll, she points to the hoodoos (tall, thin spires of rock) and canyons visible in the distance. \u201cThat\u2019s the Valley of 1,000 Devils. There\u2019s a black line along some of the ravines. Below the line you will find evidence of dinosaurs. Above that line, no dinosaurs!\u201d she exclaimed, pausing to extract a large cactus quill from a woman\u2019s shoe, and then describing the theory of how an asteroid hitting Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula caused a mass extinction of dinosaurs.\n\nThe wind whistled across the hill carrying a meadowlark\u2019s song as we walked past the remains of a homesteader\u2019s cabin. Under the 1872 Dominion Lands Act settlers got cheap land if they cultivated 40 of 160 acres. But it was the people not the land who usually broke. Those that succeeded grazed the land and focused on cattle, not plows.\n\n\u201cDo you ever see UFOs?\u201d I inquired, thinking if there were a place where a flying saucer could land unnoticed, this would be it. \u201cSure, a couple of times,\u201d retorted Keller without missing a beat. \u201cThe old-timers can also tell you about the mysterious happenings during Al Capone\u2019s era. People had garages on their property that they rented to people in the liquor trade.\u201d During the Prohibition era, the region\u2019s proximity to the Canada/U.S. border made it a good place to smuggle booze. \u201cCars would drive up, the garage doors would open, the cars would go in, and the doors would close (to load or unload liquor). A short while later the doors would open and the cars would drive away.\u201d\n\nHistory lies under every footstep in these prairies. We worked our way up a high ridge to stand among a circle of stones. \u201cThis is a teepee ring,\u201d Keller explained, \u201cFirst Nation people would have camped here and used the stones to hold down the walls of their teepees.\u201d I could see for miles in every direction and imagined Chief Sitting Bull might have found this a good spot to look for bison or unwanted visitors.\n\nAs I checked into nearby Rock Creek Campground the attendant confirmed that Chief Sitting Bull\u2019s descendants still live in the area. \u201cOne of our coworkers is a descendant of Sitting Bull. He performs a special ceremony when we put up teepees in the park,\u201d she divulged.\n\nI had the chance later to talk to Kathy Grant, a woman of M\u00e9tis (mixed European and Indigenous) ancestry who works for Parks Canada to build relationships with indigenous people. \u201cPart of my role is to reach out to indigenous groups that have had historical connections with (land that is now) the park. Their ancestors probably hunted here. Mine certainly did.\u201d\n\nGrant\u2019s great-grandfather rode in the last bison hunt in the area in the mid-1880s, but her connection to the park came from her son who worked as a summer park interpreter. \u201cAs we were growing up we heard about this national park coming. I didn\u2019t really have any feelings one way or the other about it. Maybe some curiosity.\u201d When her son got a summer job at the park, Grant recalled, \u201dI was intrigued by how he was telling the story of the park. I was fascinated. There was so much more I needed to learn.\u201d And learn she did, starting as a park interpreter in 2008.\n\nIn her newest role Grant is expanding interpretation of indigenous culture. \u201cFor this season I will help coordinate a new program called Metis connections that will showcase Metis culture through storytelling, interpretation, music and art.\u201d\n\nThe park was created from land voluntarily sold by ranchers and covers an area one-tenth the size of Yellowstone National Park. It\u2019s the only Canadian national park to protect prairie grasslands. It\u2019s split into two blocks; the east block popular with paleontology lovers and astronomy buffs, the west block more beloved by wildlife lovers. Having explored the east block I headed to west to see bison herds and the only place in Canada where I could see the black-tailed prairie dog.\n\nStopping for hiking information I discovered rattlesnakes are also common here. \u201cWould you like to borrow snake guards for hiking?\u201d asked the helpful woman at the visitor center before confirming the closest rattlesnake anti-venom was a bumpy two-hour ride away. \u201cSure,\u201d I yelped, realizing this was a park that could hurt you. A recent outbreak of sylvatic plague (related to the bubonic plague) in a prairie dog colony had Parks Canada telling visitors to avoid the part of the park.\n\nConsidering my risks managed, I took my snake guards and headed to the 70-Mile Butte trailhead named by the North-West Mounted Police patrolling the area a century earlier because the butte was easy to spot and was seventy miles west of Wood Mountain Post and seventy miles east of Eastend Post. Luckily my hike would be just over two miles. A six-foot Bull Snake slithered across the trail as I strode by, wondering if my camouflage-patterned-snake guards made me less visible to reptiles, and hoping to see no rattlers.\n\nI crested the butte and looked south to Montana from where Sitting Bull had come at a time when bison were slaughtered and little thought given to the rights of indigenous people. Now, bison populations are growing and there\u2019s new reconciliation with First Nations. While just a start, I think it\u2019s fitting for a place that offered Sitting Bull respite 143 years ago.", "description": "Dubbed the quietest grasslands on earth, this relatively new national park is full of surprises.", "authors": ["Carol Patterson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571433135/191020-patterson-grasslands-national-park-hero_hog9nh", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
