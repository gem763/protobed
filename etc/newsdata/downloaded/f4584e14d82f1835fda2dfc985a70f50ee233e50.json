And while both companies firmly deny this, other reports suggest that it's not entirely true.\n\nWeChat is a messaging platform created by Chinese giant Tencent, while Alipay is a mobile payment app, owned by another Chinese giant Alibaba. Both of these are based in China and abide by Chinese laws on cryptocurrency. In short, the country has banned cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in September 2017, in addition to having regular discussions on banning Bitcoin mining. Despite that, there seems a secret kept by the public that, allegedly, trading can still happen \u2013 and regularly does \u2013 via the two mentioned multimillion-user platforms.\n\nThe secret was revealed, however, when on October 9th, Changpeng Zhao responded to a question \u201cIs Binance now accepting fiat on-ramp with Alipay and Wechat pay?\u201d with a simple \u201cYES,\u201d which would imply that Binance is accepting fiat through the two platforms, with the exchange now being opened to P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions from China. All this comes as Binance launched P2P trading functionality with BTC, ETH and USDT available for trading against Chinese yuan.\n\nThis proved to be far from simple as the connotations behind that syllable are large and many. On the one hand, it confirmed that Chinese people, who wish to do so, can trade crypto \u2013 they can buy BTC with cash via these two apps. This was welcomed in the Cryptoverse, but the celebration was short-lasting as soon the \u201con the other hand\u201d arrived: it seems that the companies are not happy with CZ\u2019s tweet, with AliPay replying \u201cNO, you cannot\u201d, in addition to the rebuttal posted on their own account, which said that the company is closely monitoring over-the-counter transactions, but also that it stops any transactions related to crypto.\n\nIf any transactions are identified as being related to bitcoin or other virtual currencies, @Alipay immediately stops the relevant payment services. \u2014 Alipay (@Alipay) 10. oktober 2019\n\nThis was followed by WeChat denial as well, saying that \u201cWechat will never support cryptocurrencies trading, and has never integrated with any crypto merchant. [\u2026] And it says \u201cwe welcome any whistle blower to report such behavior,\u201d according to a post by Dovey Wan, a founding partner of California-based investment company Primitive Ventures, who also claims that all this is \u201ca very common compliant PR work in China.\u201d\n\nThe Wechat error message shows \u201cthis transaction is risky, in order to keep your fund safe we can\u2019t proceed with this transaction\u201d\n\n\n\nMy buddy is not frequent OTC trader and this transaction is simply for coffee, so Wechat/Alipay clearly knows which accounts are crypto OTC related \u2014 Dovey Wan \ud83d\udddd \ud83e\udd96 (@DoveyWan) 10. oktober 2019\n\nOn his side, CZ posted another tweet soon after his first in an attempt to clarify the confusion, saying that: \u201cBinance is not working directly with WeChat or Alipay. However, users are able to use them in P2P transactions for payment. Still not a small feat. But words/meaning get twisted as they are passed around.\u201d\n\nthey can, just in a P2P transaction. Buyer pays the seller directly. \u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) 9. oktober 2019\n\nAdd fuel to the fire\n\nHowever, this episode was far from being over with just a statement and a rebuttal. Larry Cermak, head analyst for news site The Block, tweeted that all this is nothing new as \u201cChinese exchanges like Huobi and OKEx used a loophole by facilitating CNY to BTC/USDT conversions disguised behind a P2P OTC front. Binance joined the race today and will support WeChat and Alipay.\u201d Additionally, in a captured twitter thread (now deleted), Cermak argued that AliPay and WeChat were aware of P2P OTC (over-the-counter) trading in China, and that they allowed it to happen because the government directed them to.\n\nTo this, CZ replied with: \u201csome things are better left unsaid. Recommend no more news like these, for the sake of the people, our industry (and your business),\u201d which some people found strange, even threatening, though most haven\u2019t seen it that way, it seems. As a reminder, Binance has recently made its first strategic investment in China.\n\nThus, particular exchanges \u2013 Huobi, OKEx, and Gate.io \u2013 have been named online in relation to this story, with people claiming that these exchanges have been offering this type of trading long before Binance. A Twitter user going by the name \u201ctruthseeker,\u201d for example, claims that Chinese government wants to issue its own coin to compete with Bitcoin and Facebook\u2019s Libra, that is allows people to own and hold BTC, and that \u201cthere have already been many other smaller exchanges in China doing peer-to-peer bitcoin trading, using AliPay and WeChat. No one really cared.\u201d The difference now is that Binance is too big of a company to ignore its claims, hence the platforms had to deny everything. This explanation was retweeted by the CEO of Binance.\n\nHuobi, OKEx, and Gate.io were not available for immediate comment.\n\nWhat can Binance do now? It\u2019s best if they just stay quiet. Let it blow over. So, don't ask @cz_binance any more questions. Instead, look up what P2P means, and judge for yourself. 5/5 \u2014 truthseeker (@truthurtm) 10. oktober 2019", "description": "Peculiar discussions have started in the Cryptosphere this week, as Changpeng Zhao (CZ), CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, seems to have confirmed that users can buy crypto through WeChat and AliPay with cash in China.
