The project, launched last year, has been met with caution by banks.\n\n\"We also need to step up our thinking on a central bank digital currency,\" he added, unveiling a so far little-known plan.\n\nAn ECB official said the project could allow consumers to use electronic cash, which would be directly deposited at the ECB, without need for bank accounts, financial intermediaries or clearing counterparties.\n\nThese actors are all needed now to process digital payments, but may no longer be necessary if the ECB took over their functions, slashing transaction costs. Libra's plan also would do without financial intermediaries.\n\nWork on the ECB project started before the launch of Libra and could last months or even years, Coeure said. The technical feasibility remains to be seen and opposition from banks is likely. He will present a report on virtual currencies to G7 finance ministers next month, officials said.\n\nLe Maire said one of the purposes of this initiative was to make sure that banks reduce fees on international payments.\n\n\"We encourage European central banks to accelerate work on issues around possible public digital currency solutions,\" Le Maire said in the joint statement with Germany's Scholz.\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGAL LIMBO\n\nWhile euro zone ministers seem united on a tough regulatory line on Libra, it is less clear whether they agree to set up common rules for virtual currencies.\n\nThe EU's financial services commissioner, Latvia's Valdis Dombrovskis, is always careful to underline that cryptoassets are an opportunity as much as a threat.\n\nThe EU does not have specific regulations on cryptocurrencies, which until Libra was unveiled had been considered a marginal issue by most decision-makers because only a tiny fraction of bitcoins or other digital coins are converted into euros.\n\nNew EU-wide rules came into force last year to increase checks on virtual currencies' trading venues with the purpose of reducing risks of money laundering and other financial crime.\n\nBut apart from that, virtual currencies move in what is largely a legal limbo in the EU, as regulators have not yet managed to agree on whether to treat them as securities, payment services or currencies in themselves - the latter option being ruled out by most.\n\nStory continues", "description": "France and Germany said on Friday that Facebook Inc's  Libra currency posed risks to the financial sector that could block its authorisation in Europe, and backed the development of an alternative public cryptocurrency.
