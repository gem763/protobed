Though shares have plunged over the past month, and trading at 42% of its 52-week high, the numbers are still strong for the company. Second-quarter revenue grew 46% year-over-year, while profit surged 55%. The primary factor in Square\u2019s decline isn\u2019t so much its poor performance, but that analyst lofty expectations were not met in Square\u2019s outlook guidance. Furthermore, the company\u2019s recent sale of Caviar has contributed to some confusion among investors, even though management say it will help them focus on core products and growth.\n\n5-star Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell clearly sees the light at the end of the current dark tunnel, as he reiterates a Buy rating and $80 price target on SQ stock. (To watch Cantwell's track record, click here)\n\nCantwell held meetings with Square management, where he came away mostly positive but still \"mixed.\u201d He says the \u201cCash App opportunity seems significant,\u201d but \u201cseller business increasingly feels like it is in 'reboot' mode.\u201d And while management believes the Caviar sale will help with core revenue focus, Cantwell believes the surprising sale \u201ccomplicates matters as it precludes management from providing much-needed clarity on the outlook for '20E,\u201d a main driver in other analysts\u2019 pessimistic views.\n\nOne of Cantwell\u2019s most positive views is on the Cash App. The analyst says the app \u201cstands out as a success\u201d for Square and believes this can be a significant source of revenue and EPS over the long-term. But he also believes the product development \u201cremains important given (valid) investor concerns related to the [long-term] sustainability of Cash App's Instant Deposit-related revenue stream.\u201d\n\nOn a more cautious note, Cantwell says \u201ccompetition is impacting SQ's ability to grow GPV,\u201d with Adyen recently signing longtime Square customer Joe & the Juice. As a result, the analyst sees Square \u201cincreasing spend to help counter rising competition from other high-quality payments companies.\u201d\n\nSquare\u2019s shifting strategy appears to \u201cbe unsettling investors in the near-term,\u201d but updated guidance and an Investor Day early next year \u201cwould give [Square the] opportunity to re-calibrate investor expectations for\u201d the short-term.\n\nAll in all, though some analysts are concerned about the short-term, Wall Street is generally bullish on Square stock. TipRanks analysis of 19 analyst ratings shows a consensus Moderate Buy, with nine analysts recommending Buy, six saying Hold and three suggesting Sell. The average price target of $78.88 represents a 34% upside from current levels.
