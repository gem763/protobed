International were down 0.7% to $59.02.\n\nThe API said crude inventories rose by 10.5 million barrels to 432.5 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 11.\n\n\"An enormous U.S. inventory build hits at precisely the wrong moment when the markets are overly focused on demand devastation due to the latest run of weaker global economic data,\" Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, said in a note cited by Reuters on Thursday.\n\nIf confirmed by the government data, the build-up would be the biggest U.S. inventory swell since February, 2017, Innes said.\n\nThe Energy Information Aministration (EIA) weekly report is due at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). The EIA is expected to report a build of 2.88 million barrels.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns over an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war and weak economic indicators lingered and were cited as headwind for the oil markets, although losses were limited after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said China and the U.S. are nailing down a phase one trade deal text for their presidents to sign in November.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said this week that the U.S.-China trade war would cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.", "description": "Oil Prices Fall as U.S. Crude Stockpiles Rise Sharply", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC7N12U_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
