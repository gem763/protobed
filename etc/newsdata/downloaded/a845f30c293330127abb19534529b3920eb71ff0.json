But this week, it was less about making mistakes than it was going deep on a plan to torture someone else, because she couldn\u2019t stand the idea of suffering alone.\n\nThe Good Place Returns And Things Are Already Forked Up The Good Place is back with its fourth and final season, and it doesn\u2019t take long for the Soul Squad to realise that saving the world is going to be one hell of a task \u2014 especially with the goobers the Bad Place is sending their way. No one expected an experiment to determine the fate of humanity\u2019s collective afterlife would be easy, but did it really have to involve Brent? Read more\n\nThe latest episode of The Good Place, \u201cChillaxing,\u201d isn\u2019t about pi\u00f1a coladas and getting caught in the rain \u2014 at least, not after Eleanor has her way. Chidi has abandoned his ethics studies class because he\u2019s too happy, so Eleanor and Michael surmise that he has to suffer an ethical conundrum to get motivated again. The answer is simple: Bring in Jason Mendoza, who reprises his role as the Buddhist monk who\u2019s secretly, well, Jason Mendoza.\n\nIt\u2019s a good plan, but things go too far. Eleanor keeps putting Chidi in uncomfortable situations with Jason, at times matching or even surpassing the torture Michael did to them during the first season. She knows Chidi\u2019s buttons and presses them hard, pushing Michael and Jason to keep going even as both of them tell her to cool down. It comes to a head when Eleanor\u2019s schemes cause Chidi to lie to a crowd of people, something that goes against his nature. He shares that he feels he\u2019s being punished for something he doesn\u2019t even know he did, which quickly shows Eleanor the error of her ways.\n\nEleanor finally admits she\u2019s hurting Chidi on purpose because she\u2019s angry at him for abandoning her, even though she knows it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s a moment of honesty and vulnerability that might be wrong on its face, but something I think we can all identify with. Doing the right thing can still piss you off.\n\nThe other storyline involves Tahani and Janet trying to help gossip columnist John, the last ethics hold-out on their list. Tahani decides it might help to pamper John with all the luxuries and hot gossip he missed out on in life, to get him happy and encourage him to try studying ethics, which she calls \u201ca colonic for the soul.\u201d Tahani and John start to bond, but her repeated attempts to get him to join Chidi\u2019s ethics class keep failing.\n\nEventually, Janet decides the best course of action is for Tahani to confront John about his moral failings, which seems like a weird course of action and naturally blows up in Tahani\u2019s face. John isn\u2019t a bad guy; deep down, he\u2019s just resentful. He had to work for the things that Tahani, and those in her social echelon, took for granted and feels she isn\u2019t in a place to criticise him for his life choices. After a heart-to-heart over bellinis, Tahani and John find common ground. Both of them yearned for acceptance to the point where it didn\u2019t matter who they hurt or how isolated it made them feel. And that wasn\u2019t ok for either of them to do.\n\nTahani returns to the group proudly declaring that John is on the right path, but in his own way. He won\u2019t be attending Chidi\u2019s classes. Instead, they\u2019re going to spend time growing and bonding together, starting with a Crossroads slumber party. I actually like that the series didn\u2019t assume every character needed Chidi\u2019s ethics class to become better people. Everybody is different, and John\u2019s way works best for him. High five, girlfriend.\n\n\u201cBye girl, I\u2019m about to go poop mushrooms!\u201d (Image: NBC)\n\nRandom Musings:\n\nDid anyone else feel it was weird that Janet suggested Tahani punch John in the face? I know she\u2019s going through a breakup with Jason, but that\u2019s still totally unlike her. Even Tahani seemed shocked at the suggestion.\n\nThe episode ends with a mysterious figure coming down the train. I have no idea who it could be, but my money\u2019s on someone from the Bad Place coming to stir up trouble again.\n\nEight of the Game of Thrones characters were modelled after Tahani \u2014 including six that would leap to action. Leave a comment with which ones you think they are!\n\nIf I threw a lava rock that gave me my heart\u2019s desire, it would be a nation of unionized workforces.", "description": "Eleanor hasn\u2019t had an easy time running an experiment to ensure the fate of humanity.
