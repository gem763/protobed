I will wait to see what transpires,\u201d Johnson told reporters while on a visit to an army training ground in western England.\n\nJohnson asked Queen Elizabeth to prorogue or suspend parliament from Sept. 10 to Oct. 14 on the grounds that he needed time to prepare a new legislative agenda. His opponents say the real reason was to prevent members of parliament (MPs) from thwarting his plans.\n\nUnder Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution, the power to suspend or dissolve parliament formally remains with the monarch, a politically impartial figure who acts in accordance with the advice of the prime minister.\n\nAt the end of three days of hearings, Supreme Court President Brenda Hale said the case was not about when and how Britain would leave the EU but only about the lawfulness of Johnson\u2019s advice to the queen.\n\n\u201cAs we have heard, it is not a simple question and we will now consider carefully all the arguments that have been presented to us,\u201d she told the court. \u201cBut we also know this case must be resolved as quickly as possible and we hope to be able to publish our decision early next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cRIGMAROLE\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing, the court was shown a handwritten note in which Johnson had described the parliamentary session as \u201ca rigmarole ... to show the public that MPs were earning their crust\u201d.\n\nDavid Pannick, a lawyer representing one of Johnson\u2019s challengers in the court case, said that this showed the prime minister had failed to understand parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nPannick said he wanted a declaration from the court that the advice to the monarch was unlawful and that parliament should reconvene to decide how to proceed. If Johnson ignored any such declaration, then it would be up to the speakers of both houses of parliament to reconvene the legislature, he said.\n\nBefore the suspension, Johnson suffered one defeat after another in the House of Commons, where he now has no majority.\n\nMost MPs are opposed to a so-called \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d scenario, predicting that it would cause economic damage and severe disruption, including to food and medicine supply chains.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of Johnson\u2019s lawyers had told the court that if the prime minister lost the case, he could recall parliament earlier than scheduled. But in a more recent document submitted to the court, the prime minister\u2019s legal team appeared to say there could still be a way for him to prevent parliament from sitting, even in the event of an adverse ruling.\n\n\u201cDepending on the court\u2019s reasoning it would still either be open or not open to the PM to consider a further prorogation,\u201d two senior lawyers representing Johnson said in the document.\n\nAmong Johnson\u2019s opponents at the Supreme Court hearing was one of his predecessors as prime minister and Conservative Party leader, John Major, who submitted a written witness statement saying that the reason given by Johnson for the suspension was not true.\n\n\u201cThe inescapable inference to be drawn (from the evidence) is that the prorogation is to prevent parliament from exercising its right to disagree with the government and legislate as it sees fit,\u201d Major said in the witness statement, according to an excerpt read out in court by his lawyer.", "description": "Britain's Supreme Court aims to deliver its ruling early next week on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully when he suspended parliament for five weeks in the run-up to Brexit, the president of the court said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Estelle Shirbon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431679126&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0NP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
