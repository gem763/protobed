That would mark the highest-level meeting of officials from both sides since Korean courts authorized the seizure of the Korean assets of Japanese businesses which refused to compensate their Korean victims of wartime forced labor.\n\nBilateral relations have drastically deteriorated, with Japan restricting exports of certain high-tech materials to Korea and striking Korea off a list of preferential trade partner, which in turn prompted Seoul to scrap a military intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo. Koreans are boycotting Japanese goods, and two-way tourism has dwindled. The intelligence-sharing pact still holds good until Nov. 22, so there is in theory time to turn things round.\n\nThe enthronement ceremony could provide a golden opportunity to mend frayed ties. The government here agrees that this is the \"most important\" aspect of the prime minister's visit. The Japanese are in a celebratory mood now they have a new emperor, and Abe is adept at reading public sentiment, so he may be inclined to take Korea's dispatch of a top official as a prompt for magnanimity and reconciliation.\n\nStill, it is too early for optimism since the differences remain deep between the two countries. Abe has repeatedly told Korea to take the first step in mending frayed ties, while the Korean government is refusing to budge. Taking the hardest line possible on the neighbor is a vote-winner for both sides. Plus pessimists say sending the prime minister, who in Korea is an administrative official, rather than Abe's actual counterpart, President Moon Jae-in, may not be taken well. But Korea and Japan, no matter what their historical grievances may be, are not only geographically close but also economically intertwined and yoked together by their alliance with the U.S. If this opportunity is missed, both sides will end up losing. It is time to put an end to the current crisis.", "description": "PM Must Seize Opportunity for Dialogue with Japan", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
