The 33-year-old Spaniard reasserted his mastery of the hard court, as well, claiming his fourth career U.S. Open title over an opponent roughly a decade his junior.\n\nNadal defeated Daniil Medvedev in a five-set humdinger in New York City, 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4. To do it, he had to fend off a furious rally by the 23-year-old Russian, who, after ceding the first two sets to Nadal, stormed back to push his celebrated opponent to the brink \u2014 and extend the marathon match's final running time to nearly five hours.\n\nBut Nadal ultimately steadied his course, breaking Medvedev's serve twice in the final to seal the victory and buttress his position in the record books. The win makes for his second Grand Slam title of the year, after he won the French Open \u2014 yet again \u2014 in June. It also gives him his 19th career Grand Slam, placing him just one title behind arch-rival Roger Federer, who currently owns the men's singles record.\n\nAfter the match, Nadal wept as the stadium in Flushing Meadows played a string of highlights from his career. He called it \"one of the most emotional nights of my tennis career.\"\n\n\"The last three hours of the match have been very, very intense, no?\" Nadal said. \"Very tough mentally and physically, too.\"\n\nNo kidding.\n\nFor all the history Nadal brought to Sunday's match, and all the edge in experience he had over Medvedev \u2014 a newcomer to the U.S. Open final \u2014 Nadal's win did not come easily. Despite clinching the first two sets, the Spaniard saw the next two slip away on broken serves. What looked early on like a possible cruise to triumph ended up taking about 4 hours, 50 minutes, in what became one of the longest matches of Nadal's considerable career.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Timothy A.
