Roles have reserved: the lead actor has been reduced to supporting actor and vice versa. Today it is BJP which does the heavy lifting. Uddhav has said he sacrificed for power and Raut has put up a brave face prophesying a Shiv Sena chief minister in the state. Elsewhere, Shiv Sena leaders recall how they upheld public interest by questioning BJP on various counts including demonetisation and job loss.\n\nWith no tie up possible with Congress or NCP and unable to fight alone, Shiv Sena is in a fix. Indian politics has seen many of these unwieldy tie ups. The BJP-PDP alliance in Jammu & Kashmir was one such. The CPM-CPI alliance in Kerala also follows the BJP-Sena template with CPI frequently acting as the opposition despite being in government, yet CPI is in no position to quit the Left Front. However, both Sena and Fadnavis will be happy with the deal that they sealed.\n\nFadnavis has a good working relationship with Uddhav and the latter may even help his continuance as Maharashtra CM if BJP is in the mood to look for a replacement to Fadnavis. For Uddhav, the risk of Sena leaders crossing over to BJP if the alliance did not materialize has also been temporarily staved off. Sena has also begun to dabble in politics outside its Marathi Manoos staple. It is courting South Indian and North Indian voters letting go of half a century of chauvinism that lit many a fire in Mumbai over migrants stealing the jobs of locals.\n\nHere is a statistic that may explain why Sena is moderating: Only 66 million out of Maharashtra\u2019s 97 million population, just 66%, could speak Marathi according to the 2001 Census. BJP with its cultural nationalism and pan-India appeal has also broadened its appeal among Marathi speakers evident from its sterling assembly election performance in 2014 and the near upset of Sena in the 2017 BMC elections. Sena appears to be realizing that depending solely on the Marathi voter may not be cogent strategy. With both Congress and NCP receding Sena may even aspire to fill the space of these two parties as a regional alternative to BJP. This could explain why BJP doesn\u2019t want Sena to slip out of the NDA fold entirely.", "description": "Shiv Sena leaders Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut have struggled to explain to cadres why Sena submitted to BJP\u2019s offer of 124 seats while the latter goes on to contest 164.
