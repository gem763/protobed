Conduct your corruption in plain sight. And, it follows a simple logic: If it were wrong, I would be ashamed of it and attempt to conceal it. The fact that I haven\u2019t attempted to shroud it is proof of its virtue.\n\nThat is what\u2019s maddening about the Trump presidency: how much harm has been done as America looked on, with full awareness of the damage, and Trump has yet to be held accountable for any of it.\n\nBut that time is drawing to an end.\n\nWrong is wrong, whether you parade it or put it away. In fact, it is the flaunting of wrongdoing that should carry more of a penalty, not less of one. We can\u2019t allow our numbness to make this normal. It isn\u2019t.\n\nThis impeachment inquiry is the best thing Congress has done to help the country in years. Some worry that an impeachment would tear the country apart. To the contrary, I believe that it will bring the country together. A majority of Americans will recognize and rally around a common set of facts, a common truth, and reject Trump\u2019s attempt to bend reality.\n\nA Pew Research Poll released last week found that 58 percent of Americans, including a quarter of Republicans, believe that Trump has done things that are grounds for impeachment.", "description": "We dare not fail this test of our constitutional government.", "authors": ["Charles M.
