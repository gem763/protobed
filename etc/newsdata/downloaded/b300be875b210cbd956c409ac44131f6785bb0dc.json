Photo: Prisma/UIG via Getty Images\n\nCanker sores (sometimes referred to as mouth ulcers or \u201caphthous ulcers\u201d), can be intensely painful. The Mayo Clinic defines canker sores as \u201csmall, shallow lesions that develop on the soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums.\u201d And to clear up a common misconception, canker sores \u201care not the same thing as cold sores or herpetic sores,\u201d says Dr. Tyrone Rodriguez, a pediatric dentist and ADA spokesperson. Canker sores only occur inside the mouth, and they are not contagious. While anyone can develop canker sores, Rodriguez tells us that certain people are particularly prone to them, and in general \u201cabout 20 percent of the population will experience them at least once per year.\u201d\n\nBoth Rodriguez and Dr. Gerry Curatola, the founder of Rejuvenation Dentistry and author of The Mouth-Body Connection, underscored the difficulty of pinpointing the exact causes of canker sores, but common triggers include any sort of physical irritation inside the mouth (from braces, an accidental cheek bite, or aggressive brushing, for example), smoking (and vaping), and spicy food. Stress, lack of sleep, nutritional imbalance, or an autoimmune disorder can also cause flare-ups.\n\nAdditionally, when the \u201coral biome,\u201d which Curatola describes as \u201cthe microbial ecosystem of your mouth,\u201d gets out of balance, it changes the immune response and can lead to canker sores. \u201cLook at it as an alarm bell and not an annoyance,\u201d he says. If your canker sores are particularly painful and persistent, the experts said it\u2019s best to speak with your dentist. But for standard-issue canker sores, there are some proven methods to deal with them \u2014 including topical treatments to provide relief and speed up healing, and toothpastes and mouthwashes that can minimize the occurrence of canker sores in the first place.\n\nBest overall topical treatment for canker sores\n\nPhillips' Milk of Magnesia, Original Flavor, 12 oz $5 (was $13, now 62% off) The first line of defense when it comes to treating canker sores is often some sort of topical pain reliever. These can also help protect the sore from further irritation and speed up the healing process. One treatment Rodriguez and Curatola both recommend is applying milk of magnesia directly to canker sores. (They suggest using a Q-tip.) According to Curatola, the benefits are more \u201cpalliative,\u201d and won\u2019t necessarily help address the underlying cause, but it can still help with the pain. In order to get a stronger effect, Rodriguez suggests mixing one part milk of magnesia with one part Benadryl and then applying the same way, topically with a Q-tip. As Rodriguez explains, \u201cBenadryl helps curb the inflammatory response that is somewhat responsible for causing the discomfort,\u201d and milk of magnesia provides a soothing protective coating. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest natural topical treatment for canker sores\n\nPlant Therapy Clove Bud Essential Oil, 10 ml Another pain-relieving topical treatment recommended by both dentists was clove essential oil, which they both warned is quite potent and should be applied in very small doses, again with a Q-tip or something similar. \u201cIt works for a lot of people,\u201d says Rodriguez, adding that since clove oil is a \u201cnatural anaesthetic, it will help calm down those nerve endings so things don\u2019t hurt as much. Curatola describes clove oil as working like \u201ca natural Benzocaine.\u201d (Benzocaine is the chemical anaesthetic in many popular topical gels.) $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest pain-relieving gel for canker sores\n\nOrajel Instant Pain Relief Gel for Mouth Sores, 0.42 oz Orajel is likely the most widely available topical treatment made specifically for canker sores. It\u2019s a pain-relieving gel that you can find in most drugstores. Rodriguez didn\u2019t recommend a specific brand, but he said that benzocaine gels in general \u201cwill shut down the nerve endings, which helps with the discomfort, but it might not stop the [inflammatory] process.\u201d An additional benefit of this type of gel, however, is that it forms a sort of protective coating over the sore which can help guard against further irritation. $6 at Target Buy\n\nBest overall mouthwash for canker-sore treatment\n\nArm & Hammer Baking Soda, 5 lbs $3 (was $7, now 57% off) Mouthwash is another popular treatment method for canker sores, and many find it easier to use since you can simply swish it around your mouth and then spit it out. Both Rodriguez and Curatola mentioned baking soda rinses as an effective remedy because baking soda is \u201calkalizing.\u201d As Rodriguez explains, \u201cMouth rinses with baking soda are effective because they raise the pH in the mouth so that things that are acidic and irritating won\u2019t hurt as much, and this can also facilitate the healing process.\u201d He recommends diluting one teaspoon of baking soda in a half-cup of warm water and then \u201cswishing it around\u201d in your mouth. $3 at Amazon Buy $3 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest antiseptic mouthwash for canker-sore treatment\n\nColgate Peroxyl Mouth Sore Rinse, Mild Mint, 16.9 oz $9 (was $12, now 25% off) Hydrogen peroxide rinse is another popular remedy for cleaning and healing canker sores, and Rodriguez says it \u201ccan be effective,\u201d but it\u2019s very important to use a solution that\u2019s 3 percent strength or less to avoid irritation. This Colgate peroxide rinse is diluted to 1.4 percent strength so it should be gentle enough, and it\u2019s also alcohol-free, which is important because alcohol \u201ccan be an irritant\u201d and further inflame sores. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest mouthwash for canker-sore prevention\n\nListerine Zero Alcohol Mouthwash, Cool Mint Flavor, 1 liter Both dentists told us that using alcohol-free mouthwash is also an important part of canker sore prevention. According to Curatola, alcohol dries out the \u201csupportive film of the oral microbiome,\u201d which he says is essential to maintaining a \u201cbalanced\u201d and healthy mouth. \u201cSaliva is the lifeblood of the mouth,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cwhen saliva flow decreases, you\u2019re more prone to developing ulcers.\u201d Using an alcohol-free mouthwash like this one will help prevent your mouth from drying out which can decrease the likelihood of developing canker sores. As Rodriguez puts it, \u201cSaliva is naturally protective, so keeping things wet in your mouth is a good thing.\u201d $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest SLS-free toothpastes for canker-sore prevention\n\nHello Naturally Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste $16 (was $25, now 36% off) Toothpaste can also trigger canker sores for some people. Rodriguez often tells patients who are having issues with mouth to sore to try out a new toothpaste brand and see if it helps. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients that have had success by switching brands, and some find that getting an SLS-free toothpaste helps.\u201d SLS, or sodium laurel sulfate, is the chemical in toothpaste \u2014 and many soaps and shampoos \u2014 that creates a \u201cfoaming\u201d effect. According to Rodriguez, SLS can act as act as an irritant for some and cause sores to develop. Rodriguez did not want to endorse a particular brand, but this toothpaste from Hello was our best-overall natural toothpaste, endorsed by two oral health experts, and it\u2019s SLS-free. $16 for 4 at Amazon Buy $4 at Target Buy\n\nAuromere Ayurvedic Herbal Toothpaste Curatola also recommends going SLS-free, but he advises patients with canker-sore issues to avoid fluoride as well. \u201cFluoride can lead to cankers,\u201d he says, because some types of fluoride \u201cirritate the soft tissue in the mouth.\u201d He also recommends looking at the ingredients list and avoiding anything with xylitol, an artificial sweetener in many toothpastes. \u201cXylitol can be very disturbing to the oral and gut microbiomes,\u201d says Curatola. $12 for 2 at Amazon Buy $12 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest toothbrushes for canker-sore prevention\n\nOral-B 7000 SmartSeries Rechargeable Power Electric Toothbrush Another potential cause of canker sores is aggressive brushing, which can irritate your gums and the inside of your mouth. Rodriguez likes some of the more advanced electric toothbrushes because they have pressure sensors \u201cthat let you know if you\u2019re brushing too hard.\u201d This Oral-B toothbrush was featured in our list of the best dentist-recommended electric toothbrushes, and it has a light-up pressure sensor to alert you when you\u2019re applying too much force. Also, the small brush head would be helpful if you do have canker sores and need to navigate around them while brushing. (Most dentists agree that an electric brush is going to be more effective than a manual one, but if you prefer manual brushes Rodriguez recommends sticking with soft bristles.) $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Walmart Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
