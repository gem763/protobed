And I am deeply, deeply sorry.\"\n\nIn the next comment from the crowd, a man in a yellow vest \u2014 who was wearing it not as a statement but because it is part of his safety gear for his job as a fuel distributor \u2014 told Trudeau he didn't think he should apologize.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau faced two very different perspectives about the photos and video showing him in blackface at a town hall in Saskatoon on Thursday. 3:19\n\n\"Please do not apologize. When you were young, you were in school,\" he said.\n\n\"I appreciate that and I appreciate the sentiment \u2014 but there was no excusing what I did and I'm sorry that I did it,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"And the same time yes, we do need to focus on how we move forward as a country on many big issues \u2026 one of those issues is making sure we have leaders that don't hurt people who face discrimination in their daily lives.\"\n\nTrudeau was also asked about his plans to de-escalate the tensions between India and Pakistan, fight fires in the Amazon rainforest and invest in science and technology.\n\nOne woman, who said she was a single mother and award-winning photographer \"drowning\" in debt, asked whether Trudeau would hire her as his personal photographer or accept \"a free photo session as payment for my accumulated government debt.\"\n\nTrudeau answered by touting his government's Canada Child Benefit and promising that a newly elected Liberal government would increase that benefit by 10 per cent per child in the first year after they're born, and suggesting a Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer would mean cuts to services and to the middle class.\n\nAsked about climate, Trudeau spoke about his party's carbon tax, an issue of contention in Saskatchewan, saying \"Scheer's 'make pollution free again' is a real problem.\"\n\n\"During the (Stephen) Harper years, their desire to focus only on the economy and not on the environment actually didn't help the economy at all,\" he said.\n\nWhile the Liberal campaign was temporarily on hold Thursday morning as Trudeau spoke to MPs and others by phone and his team worked to control the damage caused by the blackface photos, the itinerary for Friday shows an announcement and media availability planned for 10:30 a.m. ET in Toronto.", "description": "A day after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's campaign was wracked by several photos and a video that showed him appearing in blackface, he faced questions from a relatively friendly Liberal crowd at a town hall event in Saskatoon, Sask. on Thursday evening.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290622.1568932621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-liberals-20190919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
