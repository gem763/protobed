It\u2019s now selling those burgers nationwide because of strong demand from customers.\n\nThe entry of McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest burger chain, into the alternative meat arena has largely been seen as a question of when, and not if. Shares of Beyond Meat Inc bolted 11% higher at the opening bell on the McDonald\u2019s announcement.\n\nIt has been a breakthrough year for the companies that are trying to perfect the no-meat burger.\n\nBeyond Meat became a publicly traded company in May when it listed its shares for $45 on the Nadaq. By July, those shares had risen more than 430%. Impossible Foods has raised more than $750m, but remains private.\n\nBeyond Meat and Impossible Foods are now appearing on fast food menus across the United States.\n\nKFC last month began testing plant-based chicken nuggets and boneless wings at an Atlanta restaurant in partnership with Beyond Meat. Carl\u2019s Jr and Del Taco also selling Beyond Meat products. Tim Hortons has tested a Beyond Meat breakfast sausage in Canada.\n\nImpossible Foods announced in May that it was making meatless \u201csausage\u201d crumbles for the Little Caesars pizza chain in some states.\n\nFans of Wendy\u2019s have begun a petition to get the chain to add a plant-based burger to the menu. It has garnered more than 26,000 signatures as of Thursday and earlier this month, CEO Todd Penegor said plant-based burgers are \u201ca trend that will be here to stay\u201d.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is pushing forward, albeit in a very limited introduction.\n\n\u201cWhy just a small test? We\u2019re in learning mode, so testing is a major part of how we develop our menu,\u201d wrote Ann Wahlgren, McDonald\u2019s vice-president of global menu strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s how we look \u2013 before we leap.\u201d", "description": "Small-market test rolls out months after rival Burger King began testing the plant-based Impossible Foods burger", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f64feb4e56da09644151d951459aef2678d2cee2/0_66_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04a9b74eb9cc6b061cdf061eeed786f1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
