Android Police reports that the service can access as many as 100,000 radio stations through these services. (For whatever reason, the patch notes I\u2019m seeing on the UK\u2019s Google Play Store don\u2019t include this number.)\n\nAdding more features to its Android app, as well as the Android Auto support that was added to the app last week, will be important as Apple transitions into a company that\u2019s increasingly reliant on service subscriptions for its revenue. Apple wants its services to be appealing, regardless of the hardware you choose to use.", "description": "With its latest update, Apple Music\u2019s Android app is now able to stream to Chromecast devices.
