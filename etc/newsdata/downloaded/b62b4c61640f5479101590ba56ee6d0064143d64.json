San Francisco Mayor London Breed\n\nHeal the Bay, an environmental group based in California, applauded San Francisco this year for its water quality during summer months, with 92% of its beaches earning an A or B grade from the group. Nearly all of Ocean Beach, the city\u2019s largest beach, had A or A+ ratings.\n\nBreed challenged Trump to show up for a real conversation about people experiencing homelessness in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIf the President wants to talk about homelessness, we are committed to working with our state and federal partners on actual solutions,\u201d she said, pointing to the 1,000 shelter beds she plans to add by next year.\n\nThe city is also home to a needle exchange and safe injection program \u2015 something that research has shown not only reduces HIV transmissions but also cuts the number of improperly disposed needles.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to question the sincerity of Trump\u2019s concern for the environmental health of California\u2019s coastal areas. The same day he lambasted San Francisco, he announced he was revoking a federal waiver that allows the state to set its own auto emissions standards and move away from traditional oil-powered vehicles. Air pollution from those vehicles often ends up settling in waterways and oceans.\n\nState Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents San Francisco in the California legislature, slammed Trump for overlooking real issues linked to manmade climate change \u2015 a crisis that Trump has dismissed as a farce throughout his presidency.\n\n\u201cI wish Trump would have his EPA enforce against actual environmental problems,\u201d Wiener tweeted, \u201cbut I guess that would be too much to ask.\u201d", "description": "\u201cNo debris flow out into the Bay or the Ocean,\u201d Mayor London Breed said in response to the president.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83dd7923000058055848d7.jpeg?cache=3nmetdekrh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
