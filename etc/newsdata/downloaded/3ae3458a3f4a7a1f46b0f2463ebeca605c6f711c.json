If they don\u2019t poll your supporters, how would they know? The polling process is deeply flawed,\" she wrote.\n\nBefore the debate, Williamson's campaign sent an email to supporters asking them to tune into the debate and to a livestream after the debate, where she was going to give remarks in Encinitas, Calif.\n\nWilliamson did not qualify for this debate or the preceding one, and it appears she will not meet the polling and donation thresholds for the November debate.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/marianne-williamson-isnt-debate-stage-but-shes-still-running/3992186002/", "description": "\"No, they\u2019re not the only Democratic candidates for President of the United States,\" she tweeted as the debate started.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Published P.M.
