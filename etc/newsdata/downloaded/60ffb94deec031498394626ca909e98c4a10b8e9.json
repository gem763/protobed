I had to sell up.\"\n\nThe four-bedroom pad seemed to reflect the actor's aesthetic perfectly, with sleek interiors and modern design - and a very dark colour palette with blacks and gunmetal greys setting the vibe.\n\nThe Mid-century modern-style house, built in Hollywood Hills in 1958, came with a pool-side martini \"Elvis bar\" and sprawling BBQ area set beside lush greenery.\n\n(Image: REMAX/TNI PRESS LTD)\n\n(Image: REMAX/TNI PRESS LTD)\n\nInside there was a 3,500 square feet living space, with comfy-looking couches and vibrant zebra-print cushions.\n\nThe kitchen took pride of placement in the house, with an island bench and plush dining area.\n\nA quirky dog statue sat in the garden, while the shelves were full of memorabilia from his career.\n\n(Image: REMAX/TNI PRESS LTD)\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nVinnie and Tanya moved to Los Angeles, and the actor carved out a lucrative career playing an action-loving straight shooter in movies like Snatch and Swordfish.\n\nDuring an interview with Radio Times , Vinnie admitted how much he loved his LA lifestyle.\n\nHe said: \"People say you can get bored of the sunshine in LA. No, you can't.\n\n\"I play golf six days a week, and I've still got my football team, the Hollywood All-Stars. Those are my two main things.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nVinnie has since moved back to the UK, following the tragic death of his wife and recently done his first interview from Tanya's childhood home.\n\nThe Mean Machine star wept as he revealed the tragic but tender moment his beloved wife Tanya slipped away.\n\nThe footballer-turned-actor told in heartbreaking detail how he gently kissed his soulmate and told her \u201cI love you, I love you.\u201d\n\nTanya was surrounded by Vinnie and five family members, including her daughter Kaley.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nTanya had finally succumbed after a brave and dignified six-year battle with three forms of cancer.\n\nShe was treated at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles before living out her final days in the couple\u2019s Hollywood home.\n\nVinnie has now moved back into Tanya's old semi-detached property in the UK.\n\n\u201cThis place is so special to us,\u201d said Vinnie speaking about the London home.\n\n\"Being here does feel good.
