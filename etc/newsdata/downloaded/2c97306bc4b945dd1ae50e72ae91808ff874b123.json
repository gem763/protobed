You could even eat the cardboard, if that was something you ever felt the need to do.\n\nAs GI.biz report, this year\u2019s game \u2014 and every version going forwards in the future \u2014 \u201dwill come in a cardboard sleeve made from 100 per cent recycled cardboard that will be shrink-wrapped in fully recyclable low-density polyethylene.\u201d\n\nThe game\u2019s box and paper manual are printed on water and vegetable-based ink, and the manual itself will be \u201cmade from 100 per cent recycled paper\u201d. Miles Jacobson, head of developers Sports Interactive, says this even qualifies the packaging as vegan, and that if you wanted to eat the packaging, you could.\n\nAside from the disc, that is, which is the only thing inside the box that isn\u2019t easy to dispose of correctly, though included in each copy will be instructions on how to mail the DVD into a specialised recycling facility.\n\nYou might be wondering why all the fuss over a physical copy of a PC game in 2019, but Football Manager is a series whose success lies in mainstream circles where disc drives are still very much present; last year\u2019s game, for example, sold over 300,000 boxed retail copies.\n\nJacobson mentions in the video that Sega\u2019s European staff helped out a lot on the project, meaning future games released by the publisher can take advantage of the same prices.\n\nIn terms of cost, these are more expensive to produce, at around 30 cents a copy more than standard packaging, but Jacobson estimates this \u201cwill be partly offset by cheaper distribution costs and partly offset by cheaper destruction costs.\u201d", "description": "The physical copies of this year\u2019s Football Manager game are made almost entirely from recyclable materials, from the case to the shrink-wrap to the ink that\u2019s printed on it.
