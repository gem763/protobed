She dismissed the White House\u2019s argument that impeachment isn\u2019t happening without a formal vote, saying that \u201cof course, this argument has no merit.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t require a vote to begin impeachment. But Trump and his Republican colleagues have cited the lack of one to say that the probe is not real. Trump used that argument in a lengthy letter to the House earlier this month saying that he wouldn\u2019t cooperate.\n\nMany government officials have cooperated with the inquiry despite Trump\u2019s orders. But Pelosi\u2019s letter comes as a national security official defied a House subpoena Monday, escalating the standoff between Congress and the White House over who will testify.\n\nCharles Kupperman, who was a deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton, failed to show up for a scheduled closed-door deposition after filing a lawsuit asking a federal court in Washington to rule on whether he was legally required to appear. In a statement, Kupperman said he was awaiting \u201cjudicial clarity.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Kupperman\u2019s suit has \u201cno basis in law\u201d and speculated that the White House didn\u2019t want him to testify because his testimony could be incriminating. Democrats are investigating Trump\u2019s pressure on the Ukrainian government to pursue politically motivated investigations as the administration was also withholding military aid to the country.\n\n\u201cIf this witness had something to say that would be helpful to the White House, they would\u2019ve wanted him to come and testify,\u201d Schiff told reporters. \u201cThey plainly don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSchiff said the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry will move forward, with or without testimony from Kupperman and other witnesses. Democrats have indicated that they are likely to use no-show witnesses to write an article of impeachment against Trump for obstruction of justice, rather than launching potentially lengthy court battles to obtain testimony.\n\n\u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts, so we will move forward,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nTwo current National Security Council staff members, Alexander Vindman and Tim Morrison, are scheduled to appear this week and would be the first White House employees to testify in the inquiry.\n\nMorrison\u2019s attorney, Barbara Van Gelder, said in an email Monday that if Morrison is subpoenaed, he will appear.\n\nThe argument advanced by Kupperman\u2019s lawyers turns on his status as a close adviser to the president and may not be available for other administration officials who are lower down the executive branch organization chart or who did not have regular contact with Trump.\n\nKupperman, his lawyers say, met with and advised Trump on a regular basis and therefore cannot be compelled to testify.\n\nSchiff said over the weekend that he wants Bolton to testify, though that has not yet been scheduled. He told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that Bolton, who, according to other witnesses, had concerns about the Ukraine policy, \u201chas very relevant information.\u201d But he predicted that the White House, which has vowed to obstruct the investigation, would fight a Bolton appearance.\n\nAfter hearing from a series of State Department officials, the three committees leading the impeachment investigation are turning their focus to the White House. Lawmakers say they are hoping to get more answers about what aides close to Trump knew about his orders on Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the White House, so they\u2019re much closer to where the policymaking supposedly was supposed to happen with regard to the Ukraine, and they can really shine a light on whether it was happening properly or not,\u201d said Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nSeveral of the State Department officials have already told lawmakers of their concerns as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani took charge of Ukrainian policy and as Trump pushed out the U.S. ambassador there.\n\nWilliam Taylor, the current top diplomat in Ukraine, testified last week that he was told aid to the country would be withheld until the country conducted investigations into Trump\u2019s potential 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden and his family and into Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit, he asked a judge to decide whether he should accede to House demands for his testimony or assert \u201cimmunity from congressional process\u201d as directed by Trump. He said he \u201ccannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches,\u201d and without the court\u2019s help, he said, he would have to make the decision himself \u2014 one that could \u201cinflict grave constitutional injury\u201d on either Congress or the presidency.\n\n\u201cGiven the issue of separation of powers in this matter, it would be reasonable and appropriate to expect that all parties would want judicial clarity,\u201d Kupperman said in a statement.\n\nThe court had yet to rule by Monday morning, and his lawyer said in a letter that he was waiting for a judge to step in before committing to testify.\n\nThe three chairmen of the House committees overseeing the inquiry told Kupperman\u2019s lawyers in a letter over the weekend that the suit was without merit and appeared to be coordinated with the White House. They called it \u201can obvious and desperate tactic by the President to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nKupperman\u2019s attorney, Charles Cooper, wrote in a letter that it was not his client who was challenging Congress\u2019 constitutional claims.\n\n\u201cIt is President Trump, and every president before him for at least the last half century, who have asserted testimonial immunity to their closest confidential advisers,\u201d Cooper wrote. \u201cIf your clients\u2019 position on the merits of this issue is correct, it will prevail in court, and Dr. Kupperman, I assure you again, will comply with the court\u2019s judgment.\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Pelosi claims the vote will \u2018eliminate any doubt\u2019 of impeachment legitimacy after Trump said the inquiry was illegitimate without a House vote.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS067_arends_ZG_20190925161713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
