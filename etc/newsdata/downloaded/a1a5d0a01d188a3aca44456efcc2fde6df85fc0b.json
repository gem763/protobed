But perhaps the solution is less about a cure, and more about the willingness to accept the disease, physically, mentally and spiritually.\n\nAccepting disease, or any of life\u2019s problems, is fraught with mistakes and backward steps. But L\u00e9a \u200bMoret, the subject of a new Netflix documentary about her chronic cystic fibrosis (CF), says it\u2019s vital to \u201cfuck up\u201d along the way.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, Moret, 23, decided to embark on a journey to explore alternative healing methods in Central and South America, convincing her best friend, Camille Shooshani, 24, to accompany her. The film, L\u00e9a and I, documents their three-month journey, exploring medicines that could help treat Moret\u2019s chronic illness.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It can build up in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing breathing problems and nutrient malabsorption in the gut. It also makes sufferers far more susceptible to infection, which can lead to a mucus buildup in the lungs, potentially resulting in asphyxiation. The condition worsens with age and, according to the NHS, only half of those with CF will live past the age of 40.\n\nThe rise of alternative medicine Acupuncture: Practised for thousands of years in China, the technique has become increasingly popular around the world, with over 4 million sessions provided in the UK a year. Treatment involves sticking hair-thin needles in different pressure points on the body to alleviate physical pain, reduce nausea and boost mental wellbeing. Reiki: A Japanese method for stress reduction and relaxation, derived from the words rei, \u2018soul, spirit\u2019, and ki, \u2018vital energy\u2019, from the late 1800s. The treatment involves laying hands on a patient and letting energy flow from the healer. It is used to treat conditions from cancer to depression. Millions of people in the US and abroad have tried reiki in the past year. Ayurveda: A 5000-year-old Indian medicine system that is based on writings that reference a natural and holistic approach to healing. It includes natural medications made with plants, change in diet and exercise. It became popular in the Western world in the 1960s, with rising popularity through the 70s and 80s. However, discovery of toxic metals in imported medicines reduced its popularity in the mid-2000s.\n\nForty is an age associated with career security, having young children and, typically, still being physically fit. For most in this age bracket, death still looms far in the distance. For Moret and other chronic illness sufferers, death and life are intertwined.\n\nMoret has spent much of her life in denial about her illness. As she was leaving home for the first time to attend university, age 17, she had started taking less and less medication. This was partly inspired by her first experience with alternative medicine.\n\nWhen she was 16, she and her mother travelled to Mexico to visit a biomagnetist. The method of using magnets to heal the body dates back to the ancient Greeks. Magnets were \u2013 and by some still are \u2013 believed to \u201cdraw\u201d illness out of the body. Despite no scientific research supporting their efficacy, Moret believed the magnets had healed her.\n\nFive years later, as the film begins, Moret has again tested positive for pseudomonas, a common bacteria found in people with CF. Remembering her healing, Moret sought out another biomagnetist. The only one in California was in Upland, 30 minutes outside Los Angeles.\n\nThe film shows Moret and Shooshani arrive at a strip mall. The office they enter looks more like someone\u2019s living room. Moret asks the biomagnetist if he knows what CF is. As he says yes, the camera cuts to him typing \u201ccystic fibrosis\u201d into Google Translate.\n\nThis scene, and countless more throughout the film, raise the question: how much can you trust someone to heal you, especially when there is no evidence to back up their claims?\n\nMoret tells me that believing doesn\u2019t mean being blind. Alternative therapies, as much as they seek to heal the body, require you to give yourself up completely to them. Though that may be easier said than done, for those with diseases that have no cure, they\u2019re willing to put aside their ego for the sake of healing.\n\nWhen she was just 11 years old, Corinne Olson, now 24, was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis. It was a long and bumpy road to diagnosis. Initially, doctors thought it could be Lyme disease, and prescribed a cocktail of medications that included an immunosuppressant, steroids and antibiotics. Olson lost a lot of weight very quickly and began noticing her hair falling out. She tells me: \u201cWhen I returned to [the doctor] and recounted the medications she\u2019d put me on, she was shocked and exclaimed that she\u2019d \u2018forgotten\u2019 about which drugs I was taking at the same time, telling my mother and I that this combination was \u2018very dangerous\u2019.\u201d\n\nHer joints still swollen and in serious pain, the experience left her feeling helpless. Like Moret, it was only when she moved to Colorado to attend university that she became aware of and began to experiment with alternative medicines. \u201cCannabis had just become legal here for recreational and medicinal use and I\u2019d heard the buzz about CBD, so I began taking it in oil form. I immediately noticed the difference in my pain levels, but the most miraculous aspect was the significant improvement in my swelling. For years, my knees had looked like water balloons half the time and now\u2026 they didn\u2019t.\u201d Finally, her disease was under control. The experience inspired her to study medicinal healing.\n\nWhen I met Moret nearly two years ago, I had no idea she suffered from CF. As Shooshani says while filming her, \u201cL\u00e9a isn\u2019t most people. She doesn\u2019t talk about cystic fibrosis. She refuses to take antibiotics. She almost never does her breathing treatments. L\u00e9a smokes.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the film shows Moret smoking a cigarette, and more than once. Though the sight is jarring, given what we know about her disease, the shots are carefully placed. They illustrate her humanity and what it means to not be perfect, and show the joy of momentarily forgetting what separates her from anyone else her age. As Moret says, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be hyper-serious about the disease all the time. It doesn\u2019t invalidate what you\u2019re saying, it makes it more grounded.\u201d She\u2019s definitely not trying to be the spokesperson for CF.\n\nThe film also seeks to ground the audience in their expectations of what the documentary is going to be about. The majority of the film shows Shooshani filming Moret. Yet it is called L\u00e9a and I, and it\u2019s only at about 24 minutes in that we get to see who I is. The camera turns back on Shooshani and in this moment, we not only see her, but ourselves, as if we\u2019ve joined them in Peru. Moret likes this moment, because though we might think it\u2019s all about her and her CF, they\u2019re inviting us to look at our own problems, and what we might need healing. From this point on, we\u2019re more connected with them, and it comes at the perfect time.\n\nThe crux of the film lies in the ayahuasca ceremony. All her other attempts at medicinal healing (biomagnetism and a brief trial with peyote, a psychedelic cactus) have led up to this moment, for its mystery and reputation as a powerful hallucinogenic. Ayahuasca is a medicinal Amazonian tea brewed from a blend of two plants: the ayahuasca vine and leaves from a shrub called chacruna, which contains the psychoactive chemical DMT.\n\nDMT is sold as an illegal recreational substance in the UK and other countries. Unfortunately, this draws \u201cdrug tourists\u201d to the Amazon seeking a high, not healing.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be hyper-serious about the disease all the time. It doesn\u2019t invalidate what you\u2019re saying, it makes it more grounded\n\nIn fact, Moret and Shooshani left their first location for the ceremony for this exact reason. Pisac, which lies in the Sacred Valley, is known as the \u201calternative medicine capital of Peru\u201d. The streets are lined with shaman shops and billboards for ayahuasca ceremonies, often run by foreigners rather than locals. Shooshani says \u201cit feels like a way to get something without having to commit yourself to the tradition and respect it\u201d.\n\nTaking time to consider their participation in the market for ayahuasca, the women ultimately chose a ceremony run by an Amazonian shaman, where the profits went to his family and village. Additionally, Moret was going there to heal, to use the plant in the purest intention. In this way, they were following tradition.\n\nAt the start of the ayahuasca ceremony, the shaman, Ricardo Amaringo, described the nature of the plant, and how it heals. He told them that since the start of humankind, there have been only two afflictions that have plagued us: blocks and psychological traumas. To overcome these, one must look inwards: \u201cWhen you take ayahuasca, you have to have in mind only one idea, the idea of your intention: I will see my body. I want to look at my body. I want to look at my stomach. I want to look at my trauma.\u201d\n\nOne key difference between western doctors and alternative therapists is how they view the body. From what she\u2019s learnt, Moret tells me that healers view the body as a \u201c3D object\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s no distinction between spiritual and physical illness, basically they are the same thing; it\u2019s just that they manifest on three different planes, on an emotional level, a spiritual level and a physical level\u201d.\n\nWestern medicine focuses on the corporeal and often discounts the psychological trauma of illness. Emily Goddard, 35, suffers from multiple sclerosis (MS); her diagnosis was sudden. \u201cIn November 2017, I woke up one morning and I couldn\u2019t move the right side of my body. I went to the hospital and they thought I\u2019d had a stroke \u2013 when you have paralysis that\u2019s the first thing that people think. I was in hospital for a week having loads of tests done and they looked at the MRI of my brain and saw I had lots of damage which was historic, meaning it had to be something neurological.\u201d She was diagnosed in January 2018, and for three months she was unable to move her right side. Her doctors told her she may regain movement, but it would depend on her type of MS, and they were unable to give her an exact prognosis.\n\nGoddard regained full movement. When I spoke with her, like Moret, her condition had no obvious outward presentation. Though her hands quivered ever so slightly and once she forgot a word, these could be attributed to someone perfectly healthy.\n\nLike Moret, Goddard has found it difficult to accept her condition. In fact, when she recovered from her paralysis, she carried on with her life as normally as possible, living in a state of denial that she even had the illness. Though she suffers problems every day because of MS, she says, \u201cmost of the time I don\u2019t think I have an illness\u201d.\n\nDespite the physical ailments, she says \u201cthe hardest part for me has been coming to terms with it mentally\u201d. To combat the mental struggle she faces, Goddard has decided to take psychedelic mushrooms this October. Extensive research has been done on the positive effects of mushrooms on mental health, and inspired her to try them. She feels that her diagnosis has made her feel like a more negative person, and that in a way, it\u2019s stunted her personal growth. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s made me really bold in other ways it\u2019s made me afraid of everything.\u201d\n\nAll antidepressants do is numb you and I don\u2019t want to be numbed. I don\u2019t want to have any sensations taken away from me because MS takes that away from you anyway.\n\nThough she\u2019s never been a drug user, Goddard feels that mushrooms can offer something western medicine can\u2019t. They allow you to connect more deeply with your body and mind. She feared that by going to a psychologist, they would prescribe her antidepressants. \u201cAll antidepressants do is numb you and I don\u2019t want to be numbed. I don\u2019t want to have any sensations taken away from me because MS takes that away from you anyway.\u201d She\u2019d rather be present and fully experience her mental health problems rather than try to stifle them. While western medicine focuses on taking away painful sensations, alternative therapies delve deeper into the discomfort, to solve it from within.\n\nFor those without chronic disease or pain, it can be easy to forget that they\u2019re not perfect. Most of us assume our bodies are always going to do what we need them to. When this sometimes isn\u2019t the case, it can change your view on things. Like shaman Amaringo says: \u201cyou must look at your body\u201d.\n\nAt the end of L\u00e9a and I, we\u2019re left wondering what happened with Moret\u2019s disease. Did the ayahuasca heal her? Well, it depends on your definition of healing. By the end of the film, that will have likely changed.\n\nThough she did not experience lasting physical changes, during the ceremony, Moret reacted to the medicine differently. \u201cEveryone was throwing up, but I was actually coughing which was really weird because I never threw up in the six times I took it.\u201d In one ceremony, she saw no visions, but her body shook uncontrollably. \u201cI was just coughing, coughing, coughing more than any time I\u2019ve done my breathing treatments. The plant was making me shake.\u201d The breathing treatments for CF are vibrational therapy, which helps the body cough up mucus. Shooshani couldn\u2019t believe that ayahuasca had done the same thing.\n\nHer CF may be unchanged physically, but Moret\u2019s mental state has shifted. Her biggest takeaway from the experience was \u201cto accept whatever comes to you. For me the hardest one was accepting the illness. Because I couldn\u2019t accept it I couldn\u2019t accept a lot of other things.\u201d Ayahuasca showed her how to accept it. She was able to see the life she was given as \u201cher path\u201d and that she was lucky to have received her life and all the struggles that come with it. She believes that it is through this acceptance that you can take on all problems in your life, physical or otherwise.\n\nAs much as the film is an exploration of healing, it is more an exploration of the self. Moret and Shooshani don\u2019t seek to prescribe, and that\u2019s important to note. Rather, they assert that healing is incredibly, deeply personal. Everyone\u2019s path is different\n\nThey don\u2019t want you to watch this film and take ayahuasca. Rather, they say, if you\u2019re meant to take the plant, \u201cit will call you\u201d.\n\nOlson, who studies medicinal plants, says plants can offer benefits that traditional medicine simply can\u2019t: \u201cTheir phytochemical makeups are like complex symphonies of molecular interaction which work in synchronicity with each other and with the body\u2019s chemistry. Western medicine has discovered the most \u2018potent\u2019 phytochemicals in these plants, isolated them, synthetically replicated and mass-produced them as pharmaceuticals distributed to the public. But honestly, it\u2019s just the violin, just the melody, instead of a whole orchestra creating something that is biologically designed to work with and metabolise in the body. Life recognises life.\u201d\n\n\u2018L\u00e9a and I\u2019 is available on Netflix and you can L\u00e9arn more about the film here", "description": "An incurable disease, by its very nature, sounds like an issue that cannot be solved.
