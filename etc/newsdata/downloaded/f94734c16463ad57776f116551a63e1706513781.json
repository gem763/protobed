(\u201cHEXO\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX:HEXO; NYSE:HEXO) today announced that the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Michael Monahan, has made the decision to resign, effective today.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince joining HEXO Corp, it has become apparent that this job requires me to spend the majority of my time in Gatineau and in Ottawa. During this phase of rapid expansion, the Chief Financial Officer should be working very closely with all team members, in person. This isn\u2019t possible for me at this time given my family\u2019s needs and so I have decided to resign,\u201d said Mr Monahan. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very rewarding time at HEXO and I will continue to assist the company as a consultant to ensure a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nHEXO Corp\u2019s CEO has also announced that Stephen Burwash, who is currently Vice-President of Strategic Finance for the Company, has accepted the role of Chief Financial Officer.\n\n\u201cAlthough Michael has only been with HEXO a short time, he has made a valuable contribution to the Company,\u201d said Sebastien St-Louis, CEO and co-founder of HEXO. \u201cWhile I understand his reasons for his resignation, I am sorry to see him leave the Company. We\u2019re pleased that he has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company to assist with the transition, and I am grateful for his expertise, advice and counsel. With that said, I am pleased that Stephen Burwash, who has a strong track record with the Company, is taking on the role of Chief Financial Officer.\u201d\n\nAbout HEXO Corp\n\nHEXO Corp is an award-winning consumer packaged goods cannabis company that creates and distributes innovative products to serve the global cannabis market.
