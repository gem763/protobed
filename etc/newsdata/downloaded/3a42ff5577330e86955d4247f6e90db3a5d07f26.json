And many drivers with older cars could also be stung, with some having to fork out an extra \u00a315 a year.\n\nTo help you find out how much extra you'll be paying, we've created a selection of handy tools so you can see if your car tax costs will jump this month.\n\nStealth car tax hike: Use our tools to work out how much extra you'll be paying in VED from April 1\n\nMy car was registered after 1 April 2017\n\nCars with number plates featuring: 17 (registered after April 1 2017), 67, 18, 68, 19\n\nThe Government opted to revamp VED rates in April 2017.\n\n'First year tax' (only paid the first year you buy a brand new car) has a scaled rate based on how much CO2 emissions your car produces.\n\nThe 'standard rate tax' - paid from the second year onwards - is different. Now it is a flat rate scheme for all but zero-emissions electric cars (which are exempt).\n\nThis flat rate is \u00a3140 (\u00a3130 for hybrid cars) a year. That means it nullifies whether your vehicle has low CO2 emissions or not.\n\nIt means owners of the an economical Ford Fiesta has to pay the same in car tax as someone who purchases a 5.0-litre petrol-guzzling Mustang V8 after the second year.\n\nAs of April 1 there will be changes to both the first year rates and the standard ones.\n\nFor owners of electric and some hybrid cars, first year rates will be unchanged.\n\nHowever, those with petrol and diesel models producing more than 90 grams per kilometre of CO2 (which is all of them), the smallest increase will be \u00a35 for the first year.\n\nFor those with high emissions cars with big thirsty engines, first year tax could rise by as much as \u00a365.\n\nThe standard rate increase is just \u00a35 a year - increasing to \u00a3145 for petrol and diesel models and \u00a3135 for hybrids. Pure electric cars remain free.\n\nLast year's standard rate also came with an 'additional' premium rate for all cars - even electric models - with a list price of \u00a340,000 or more.\n\nThis additional rate added another \u00a3310 onto the standard rate of tax for five years.\n\nThat rate will also increase from April, going up to \u00a3320.\n\nIf your car was registered after 1 April 2017, use the tool below to find out how much extra in VED you'll be paying in 2019.\n\nIf you're unable to see the tool in the MailOnline app please click on this link to view it on our website instead.\n\nMy car was registered between 1 March 2001 and 31 March 2017\n\nCars with number plates featuring: Y,51, 02, 52, 03, 53, 04, 54, 05, 55, 06, 56, 07, 57, 08, 58, 09, 59, 10, 60, 11, 61, 12, 62, 13, 63, 14, 64, 15, 65, 16, 66, 17 (registered in March 2017)\n\nIf your car was registered between March 2001 and the end of March 2017 you're also likely to have to pay more VED from April 1.\n\nVehicles with the lowest CO2 outputs - less than 120g/km - won't have to pay any extra.\n\nHowever, anyone with a car emitting more than 121g/km CO2 will have to pay between \u00a35 and \u00a315 a year more.\n\nUse the tool below to find out how much extra in VED you'll be paying if your car is around 2 and 17 years old.\n\nIf you're unable to see the tool in the MailOnline app please click on this link to view it on our website instead.\n\nMy car was registered before 1 March 2001\n\nCars with pre-Y-reg number plates\n\nThe Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVSA) exclusively confirmed to This is Money that owners of cars registered before 1 March 2001 will also have to pay more car tax each year from April 1 2019.\n\nThis will depend on the engine size of your car.\n\nFor those with vehicles with engines larger than 1.55 litres, VED has increased \u00a310 to \u00a3265 a year, while owners of cars with smaller engines will see their annual tax go up by \u00a35.\n\nUse the tool below to find out how much you tax is going to increase if you have a car registered before March 2001.\n\nIf you're unable to see the tool in the MailOnline app please click on this link to view it on our website instead.\n\nMy car is more than 40 years old\n\nIf your car is more than 40 years old it will be exempt from VED.\n\nHowever, you do need to apply through the DVLA to register your vehicle to be free from car tax.", "description": "For buyers of new cars this could mean an increase in first year VED rates of up to \u00a365.
