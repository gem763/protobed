Hinch said. \u201cThey threw a big punch at us in the beginning of this series.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough experience and enough feel about how series go that we knew (if) we win today, get a little bit of mojo back on our side, a little bit of momentum, start to swing the bats a little bit better, it was a huge win to sort of re-energize us.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the triumph was an airing of concerns everyone on the team was feeling after falling behind 2-0 with home defeats, a hole only three teams have ever escaped from to win the title.\n\n\u201cSome guys said some things I think a lot of us maybe were thinking in our heads but it\u2019s sometimes nice to hear them out loud,\u201d Astros relief pitcher Will Harris said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing was we didn\u2019t want anybody feeling sorry for themselves coming in here because that\u2019s not going to accomplish anything. That was the message.\u201d\n\nThe Astros, seeking their second title in three seasons, knew no club has ever won a World Series after falling behind 3-0.\n\n\u201cEvery man in there was aware of where we were and understood that to do your job today as well as you could was very important,\u201d Harris said. \u201cA lot of energy in our dugout and we expect to carry that over to tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe believe in each other in there.\u201d\n\nFour-time All-Star outfielder Michael Brantley, who singled in two runs, said the team meeting let leaders seize the moment.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of veteran leaders in our locker room that have been here before, a lot of guys that played in the World Series and know what it takes,\u201d Brantley said.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of faith in each other, a lot of confidence in one another. Just wanted to make sure we know we still had it, were still going to play as a team.\n\n\u201cThis is a team effort. Everyone is picking up one another regardless of who is at the plate or what\u2019s going on. We\u2019ve got to come out and play a good game tomorrow, set the tone and play as a team.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Urquidy ready for start \u2013\n\nHouston\u2019s 24-year-old Mexican rookie right-hander Jose Urquidy \u2014 who has allowed one run in 4 1/3 innings over two playoff games \u2014 will start Saturday\u2019s game four, in which the Astros are expected to dig deep into their bullpen against Nationals left-hander Patrick Corbin.\n\n\u201cJust right now after the game ended the manager told me I was going to have the ball,\u201d Urquidy said. \u201cI\u2019m living the dream. I\u2019m very happy. Very few Mexicans have had this opportunity. I\u2019ll try to take advantage of it as much as possible.\n\n\u201cI know they are very good hitters. They attack very good. I\u2019ll give it my best stuff, pitch by pitch.\u201d\n\nUrquidy is ready for the challenge, according to Brantley.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the stage is too big for him,\u201d Brantley said. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he prepares.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Taubman no distraction \u2013\n\nThe firing of team executive Brandon Taubman over intimidating remarks made to women reporters has not been an issue to the players, Harris said.\n\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with really anybody in our clubhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a completely isolated issue that didn\u2019t involve a player so none of us are really concerned with any of that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nOf huge concern is Nationals slugger Juan Soto, who was silenced on his 21st birthday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to adapt to him,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cOur pitchers did a good job of mixing. We didn\u2019t stay in one area. We didn\u2019t get him out the same way twice.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A players-only meeting helped the Houston Astros solidify their confidence in one another after two shock home losses, setting up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/d5d58d_houston-harris-pitches-in-astros-win-washington-nationals-in-game-major-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
