The S&P 500's total return index ( ) posted an all-time high.\n\nE-mini futures for the S&P 500 ( ) started firm on Monday, extending the positive momentum from last week.\n\nStrong results from companies including Intel (O: ) also boosted sentiment in equities market. More than 81% of U.S. companies have beaten Wall Street expectations so far this earnings season despite concerns about the trade war.\n\nInvestors next await earnings from the likes of Alphabet Inc (O: ), Apple (O: ), Facebook (O: ) and Exxon (N: ).\n\nActivity later in the week will be dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which markets expect is all but certain to lower interest rates at its Wednesday meeting.\n\nThe Bank of Japan meets on Thursday. On Friday, indicators for Chinese and U.S. manufacturing will be released.\n\n\"The outcome of the FOMC policy meeting will most likely draw the largest market reaction,\" said Richard Grace, Sydney-based chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.\n\n\"We also think the risk is the FOMC will articulate a pause,\" for future rate decisions, Grace added.\n\n\"That means the 27.6% pricing for an additional 25 bps cut in December will quickly evaporate, sending U.S. yields and the USD higher.\"\n\nIn currencies, the ( ) was unchanged at 97.822 against a basket of six major currencies. The Japanese yen was a tad lower at 108.72.\n\nSterling was last trading at $1.2824, barely changed from Friday's close.\n\nThe European Union agreed to London's request for a Brexit deadline extension but set no new departure date. That gave Britain's divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for a snap election.\n\nEarlier, sources told Reuters the 27 European Union countries that will remain after Brexit hope to agree on Monday to delay Britain's divorce until Jan. 31 with an earlier departure possible.\n\nThe euro ( ) trod water too at $1.1083.\n\n\"It feels like the calm before a potential storm, where the event risk heats up with political twists and turns, key economic data and central bank meetings,\" said Chris Weston, Sydney-based strategist at Pepperstone.\n\nOil prices climbed, supported by optimism on the trade front and by falling stocks.
