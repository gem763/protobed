Min was expected to fly to Kazakhstan, where it would have sent a bunch of coordinates over SMS that it collected while out of range of a network. Those texts would have cost of approximately 30 cents each. However, Min apparently flew straight to Iran and the texts were sent from there, where they cost approximately 77 cents each. Come on, Min!\n\n\u201cThey really left us penniless,\u201d Igor Karyakin of the Russian Raptors Research and Conservation Network said, according to AFP.\n\nFortunately, it seems like the team will be able to pay for the charges. The crowdfunding campaign has apparently raised more than 100,000 rubles, according to the BBC \u2014 about $1,563 \u2014 which will help pay for the trackers through the end of the year, according to an auto-translated Facebook post from one of the researchers. The researcher also said on Facebook that the team\u2019s wireless carrier, MegaFon, will \u201creturn the Iranian spending\u201d accrued by Min and make a \u201cspecial tariff\u201d for tracking the eagles, so it seems it will be cheaper for the researchers to track them moving forward.\n\nIf you want to better browse the eagles\u2019 migration routes yourself, check out this interactive tracker on the Russian Raptors Research and Conservation Network website.\n\nAnimal tracking is becoming increasingly easier as tags become more powerful, more efficient, and are less obtrusive to the animals. Here\u2019s a great article about it in the Washington Post. Sometimes, though, animals with trackers have been thought to be spying \u2014 this National Geographic article has a few humorous examples, my favorite being the 14 squirrels in Iran accused of wearing eavesdropping equipment.", "description": "Migrating eagles with tracking beacons that send texts reportedly accrued roaming charges so high that scientists had to take out a loan to pay for them, as well as attempt to raise money from a crowdfunding campaign \u2014 because some of the birds made unexpected detours (via BBC).", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcQ46DRK8DGSHbfY6_CXLbazNSs=/150x146:1188x689/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19320298/_f6VOHdZ4ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
