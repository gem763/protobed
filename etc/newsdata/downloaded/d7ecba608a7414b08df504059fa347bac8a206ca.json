She put herself in contention to fight for the belt with a one-sided unanimous decision win over Waterson (17-7 MMA, 5-3 UFC) in the main event matchup, which took place at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., and streamed on ESPN+.\n\nCheck below for the top Twitter reactions to Jedrzejczyk\u2019s victory over Waterson at UFC on ESPN+ 19.\n\n* * * *\n\nAt long last: 13 down, just one to go. It\u2019s the #UFCTampa main event between former women\u2019s strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk (@JoannaMMA) and Michelle Waterson (@KarateHottieMMA). Who are you picking? https://t.co/H5NuiGXmV5 pic.twitter.com/T5lHc6Ui6z \u2014 MMA Junkie (@MMAjunkie) October 13, 2019\n\nThe size and strength advantage for J\u0119drzejczyk is too much for Waterson thus far. Not surprising since Waterson is a former atomweight and J\u0119drzejczyk recently fought at flyweight. #UFCTampa \u2014 Rob Tatum (@RobTatum303) October 13, 2019\n\nJedrzejczyk has used her size advantage well. \u2014 Heidi Fang (@HeidiFang) October 13, 2019\n\nJedrzejczyk showing glimpses of new tricks/feels from the clinch, but is ultimately getting her head and frame game going, which is bad news for Waterson. #UFCTampa \u2014 Dan Tom (@DanTomMMA) October 13, 2019\n\nJoanna is still really really good, guys. \u2014 caposa (@Grabaka_Hitman) October 13, 2019\n\nGah size difference is too much. \ud83d\ude22 \u2014 Cynthia Vance (@cynthiavance) October 13, 2019\n\nCrazy to think this fight almost didn\u2019t happen during fight week . This is a good fight so far #UFCTampa \u2014 Derek Brunson (@DerekBrunson) October 13, 2019\n\nMichelle Waterson needs an answer for Joanna Jedrzejczyk's urgently. Paths to victory shrinking at a rapid rate for her after two rounds. #UFCTampa \u2014 Mike Bohn (@MikeBohnMMA) October 13, 2019\n\nWaterson getting broken down here\u2026 glad a veteran ref is in there as opposed to the official they had assigned for the Gifford-Davis fight. #UFCTampa \u2014 Dan Tom (@DanTomMMA) October 13, 2019\n\nThis has been a good night for fighters taking beatings on the feet. Or bad night, if you're one of those fighters. #UFCTampa \u2014 jim genia (@jim_genia) October 13, 2019\n\n\u2026are those the first takedowns and submission attempt of Joanna\u2019s UFC career? #UFCTampa \u2014 David BixenSP\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf83KY (@davidbix) October 13, 2019\n\nThis is a vintage Joanna Jedrzejczyk performance. When she\u2019s fighting like this, JJ is difficult to beat at strawweight. #UFCTampa \u2014 Marc Raimondi (@marc_raimondi) October 13, 2019\n\n30-27 Joanna despite the late round submission scare. \u2014 Aaron Bronsteter (@aaronbronsteter) October 13, 2019\n\nThat did nothing but piss her off \u2014 Belal Muhammad (@bullyb170) October 13, 2019\n\nFantastic reaction from Waterson to get that position, but Jedrzejczyk looks to make her pay at the end. Wow. #UFCTampa \u2014 Dan Tom (@DanTomMMA) October 13, 2019\n\nThat front kick from Waterson isn\u2019t doing anything to Joanna \u2014 not should it. She needs to abandon it.#UFCTampa \u2014 Phil Murphy (@Phil_Sports) October 13, 2019\n\nWaterson's front kick is one of the most useless strikes I've ever seen. \u2014 Lucas Bourdon (@lucas_bourdon) October 13, 2019\n\nRespect to Waterson, she has the samurai spirit.#UFCTampa \u2014 John Wayne Makdessi (@JohnMakdessi) October 13, 2019\n\nJoana\u2019s right foot look really bad #UFCTampa \u2014 Rafael dos Anjos (@RdosAnjosMMA) October 13, 2019\n\nEvery time Michelle gets elbowed across her face, my eyes tear up\u2026 #UFCTampa \u2014 Mike Jackson, Esq. (@TheTruthJackson) October 13, 2019\n\nWaterson is so damn tough. But man, Joanna has her surrounded skull-wise. \u2014 Ben Fowlkes (@benfowlkesMMA) October 13, 2019\n\nThat \ud83e\uddb6\ud83d\ude33 \u2014 Amanda Nunes (@Amanda_Leoa) October 13, 2019\n\nJoanna Contender\u2019s right foot is definitely broken. #UFCTampa \u2014 Michael Chiesa (@MikeMav22) October 13, 2019\n\nMichelle keeps throwing that worthless front kick like why she\u2019s not even trying to land it! \u2014 Mike \"Biggie\" Rhodes (@TeamRocBiggie) October 13, 2019\n\nZhang Li vs JJ sign me up ! #UFC \u2014 Derek Brunson (@DerekBrunson) October 13, 2019\n\nNice fight ladies!
