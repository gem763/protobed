'When I thought I was the father I didn\u2019t have a problem with it.'\n\nBut while the judge ordered the child support to end, the Florida Department of Revenue appealed the decision.\n\nThe appeal means Sinawa has been forced to continue paying child support until the situation is resolved in court - even though he says the mother is OK with him no longer paying.\n\n'She told the judge she just wants this to be done and over with, and so do I.' he said.\n\nThe courthouse in St. Augustine, Florida, where Joseph Sinawa will battle again to have child support ended as DNA proved he's the biological father\n\nSt. Augustine Attorney Brandon Beardsley told First Coast News this is the first time he has seen this happen.\n\nBut he believes the state's appeal will ultimately fail.\n\nHe said: 'It was a waste of Florida taxpayer resources to appeal a decision when the end result is going to be the same.'\n\nSinawa is representing himself in court as he is tight on cash.\n\nHe added: 'I don't want to keep reliving what I've already had to go through.'", "description": "Joseph Sinawa, of\u00a0Saint Johns County, Florida, signed the birth certificate of the child when it was born because he believed he was the father, but a court-ordered DNA test left him devastated.", "authors": ["Jerry Barmash For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/16/19927890-0-image-a-5_1571497781083.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
