July 2019 was one of the warmest months ever recorded - and July temperatures almost everywhere on Earth have been higher in the last 10 years compared with 1880-1900, as this globe shows. Scroll below to find out how the temperature in 1,000 major cities across the world has changed already and how much it could increase by in the coming years.\n\nScientists have warned we must limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. That's compared to the temperatures in 1850-1900, before widespread industrialisation.\n\nThe earth has already warmed about 1C since then.\n\nThat may not sound like much, but if countries don't act to limit warming, our world could face \"catastrophic change\", according to the leading international body on global warming, the IPCC.\n\nSea levels will rise, risking the displacement of hundreds of millions of people. We'll also face more extreme weather such as droughts, heatwaves and heavy rains, and our ability to grow crops like rice, maize and wheat would be in danger.\n\nIf global warming continues at today's rate, temperatures may rise by 3-5C by the end of the century.", "description": "Climate change: Find out how much the area around your city has already warmed and what may lie ahead", "authors": ["The Bbc Visual", "Data Journalism Team"], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/shorthand-how_much_warmer_is_my_city_news/climate_change_promo_976_v2_gzpig.jpg"}
