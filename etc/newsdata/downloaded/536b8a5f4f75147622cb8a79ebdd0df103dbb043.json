Mark Lennihan\u2014AP\n\n\u201cAfter intense deliberation, the council concluded that it was best to take this drastic step,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThe courts have changed considerably over the last few years, and we cannot count on them to rule in favor of much-needed protections for the LGBTQ community. To be clear, this alleged therapy is barbaric and inhumane, but repealing this law seemed to be the best path forward.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom had filed a federal lawsuit over ban in January on behalf of a therapist in Brooklyn, saying it violated free speech between a therapist and client. Alliance Senior Counsel Roger Brooks said that if the repeal goes through, the organization would \u201ccommend the move.\u201d\n\nHe called the law \u201creally quite extreme\u201d and pushed back against the idea that it was vulnerable only because of a more conservative Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a political issue as well-established First Amendment law,\u201d he said.\n\nA New York state ban that applies only to minors would still be in effect.\n\nThe therapy has been banned for minors in other states, as well. Brooks said there are currently challenges to some of those laws by other organizations, which he expected would continue.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The repeal is sparked by a pending federal lawsuit where a therapist says the ban violates free speech between a therapist and client.", "authors": ["Deepti Hajela"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/nyc-conversion-therapy-repeal.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
