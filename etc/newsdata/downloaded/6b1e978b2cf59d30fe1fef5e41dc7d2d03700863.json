Turkish troops were advancing - the UN got in there and scooped up the kids.\"\n\nThe children are now in Raqqa, which will soon be under regime control, he added.\n\n\"Damascus has in the past allowed the children of extremists to be repatriated to their countries, but only countries they have diplomatic relations with,\" our correspondent said\n\n\"Britain doesn't have any embassy or any consular assistance inside Syria. So it's going to be very complicated to get the kids out of there.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Kurdish officials said hundreds of IS-affiliated foreigners escaped from the camp amid a Turkish offensive.\n\nThe Turkish military has launched a major cross-border operation in north-eastern Syria against a Kurdish-led militia alliance.\n\nIn a statement, Save the Children said the three children were unharmed. The charity added: \"Yesterday over 900 people including 700 children fled the annex in Ein Issa [Ain Issa], where foreign families were staying. Most of them are unaccounted for. We are deeply concerned for their wellbeing and safety of the children among them.\n\n\"Children in Syria who have fled ISIS-held areas are innocent. They are swept up in horrific events far beyond their control and deserve to be safe and protected.\"", "description": "Amira, Heba and Hamza, thought to be from the UK, are among 24 orphans taken to safety by the UN.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qyvgz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
