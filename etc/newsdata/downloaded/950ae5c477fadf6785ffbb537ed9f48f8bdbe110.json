Marfrig has recently launched an environment \u201ctransition bond\u201d to tap into the growing sustainable investment market.\n\nIn January, inspectors from Ibama, Brazil\u2019s environmental watchdog, found cattle from Limeira Ranch grazing on illegally deforested land inside a protected region, the Triunfo do Xingu environmental protection area in Par\u00e1 state. The region has been devastated by forest fires this year.\n\nThe part of the farm where the cattle were found had been placed under an official embargo \u2013 which prohibits grazing \u2013 three years before, due to illegal felling. Embargos are imposed for environmental violations and serve both as a punishment and protective measure to allow land to recover.\n\nFor breaking the embargo, the ranch was fined 1.19m reais (\u00a3236,000) this year. Despite this, documents obtained by Rep\u00f3rter Brasil show that 144 cattle from Limeira Ranch were subsequently supplied to a Marfrig abattoir in Tucum\u00e3, in Par\u00e1. The company also bought cattle from the ranch on multiple occasions in late 2018. There is no evidence that the cattle Marfrig purchased were themselves raised on illegally deforested land.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The increased number of blazes in Brazil this summer has sparked global outrage.

It was not on the Ibama embargoed producers list, there was no satellite detection of deforestation in the area and the rancher was not on the official list of companies using slave-like labor.\n\n\u201cIbama issued a negative certificate assuring that on that date \u2026 nothing was against the supplier. And that\u2019s the only way companies \u2013 not just Marfrig \u2013 can look for official information in real time. From the moment the official inclusion information was made available by Ibama, the supplier (and so in any and all cases) was automatically and immediately blocked. This means that, since then, rancher Adriano Jos\u00e9 de Mattos and Fazenda Limeira cannot supply Marfrig.\u201d Marfrig supplied the Ibama certificate clearing the ranch as part of their reply.\n\nThe Bureau has established, using trade data and shipping records, the extent of the links between Brazilian meat companies and the UK. Nearly \u00a31bn worth of beef supplied by three of the meat giants \u2013 Marfrig, JBS and Minerva and their subsidiaries \u2013 was directly imported to the UK in the past five years.\n\nMuch of this supplied major UK supermarkets, as well as wholesalers and independent food companies.\n\nMeanwhile new figures released by Trase, a supply-chain initiative run by the Stockholm Environment Institute and NGO Global Canopy, delineate the deforestation risks in the export supply chains of three of Brazil\u2019s major beef companies, including Marfrig. The Trase research mapped supply chains for beef from international markets back through customs and slaughterhouses to the municipalities where cattle were raised, using customs, agricultural, and sanitary inspection data.\n\nHaving traced the cattle back to their original municipalities, Trase cross-referenced government figures on cattle numbers with deforestation data and official data on new pastures to calculate a deforestation \u201crisk\u201d \u2013 presented as an area in sq km \u2013 associated with companies and specific international markets.\n\nThe analysis includes data on \u201cindirect\u201d suppliers, which are often intermediate farms that don\u2019t sell directly to abattoirs, but supply other farms that may truck cattle to slaughter.\n\nAccording to Trase\u2019s calculations, Marfrig\u2019s beef exports come from farms linked to up to 100 sq km of deforestation risk a year in Brazil. Trase also calculated figures for JBS, the world\u2019s biggest meat company, and Minerva Foods, another large global supplier of Brazilian beef. JBS beef exports have been linked to farms involved in up to 300 sq km of deforestation risk per year, and Minerva Foods linked to farms involved in 100 sq km of risk, according to the research.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cowherders move cattle from farms in the Terra do Meio, in the state of Par\u00e1.

Precisely because it understands that there is a risk and that Trase information provides relevant services for the preservation of biomes, Marfrig developed and implemented its geo-monitoring platform. This system is audited by an independent third party \u2013 Norwegian DNV GL. Using this platform and analysing Trase information, Marfrig substantially mitigates the risk of acquiring animals from deforestation \u2013 using, since 2009, the zero deforestation criterion for the Amazon biome.\u201d\n\nMinerva said: \u201cSustainability forms one of the fundamental pillars of Minerva Foods, at its core to feed the world, conserve the planet and enhance human value \u2026 100% of Minerva\u2019s purchases come from zero-deforestation areas in the Amazon biome. Overlapping our suppliers\u2019 ranch map with deforestation polygons, indigenous lands and environmental protection areas, our sustainability department blocks any supplier that are not compliant with any of the criteria, which effectively means that Minerva can\u2019t buy any animals coming from these suppliers.\u201d\n\nJBS said: \u201cJBS has an unwavering commitment to combat, discourage and eliminate deforestation in the Amazon region \u2026 For nearly a decade, we have monitored our supply chain with satellite technology, geo-referenced farm data and official government records to ensure compliance with our stringent responsible sourcing policies \u2026 We are independently audited according to Greenpeace\u2019s Amazon Biome Cattle and Beef standards. The most recent audit in 2018, conducted by DNV GL, a global quality assurance and certification company based in Norway, confirmed that 100% of our cattle purchases were in compliance with our responsible sourcing policies.\u201d\n\nBurger King told us: \u201cOur goal is to eliminate deforestation within our global supply chain, and we are working toward this.\u201d They said that all their suppliers were required to comply with their sustainability and forest protection policies.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it aimed to eliminate deforestation from its global supply chains by 2030 and that it had \u201cmade a commitment not to purchase raw material from any farm in the Amazon \u2026 linked with deforestation\u201d.\n\nThis July Marfrig launched a $500m \u201ctransition\u201d bond. Like \u201cgreen bonds\u201d, which allow environmentally friendly firms to raise cash, bankers have designed transition bonds for companies with the potential to clean up their practices to fund that change. In the bond framework, the company states: \u201cOur vision is to be recognised as the best global protein company. This will happen with commitment to sustainability.\u201d", "description": "Brazilian meat company which has supplied McDonald\u2019s and Burger King bought cattle from farm using deforested land earlier this year, investigation shows", "authors": ["Andrew Wasley", "Alexandra Heal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa6a90a25f3f8e37aae7d0ca0f831d56ba564fe8/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=546ea5e9ab9d06b72585aee87d4d4c0d", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
