MORE's New York City properties showed discrepancies in how some occupancy figures, expenses and profits were reported, ProPublica reported Wednesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProPublica obtained property tax documents for four of Trump's New York properties that were public because Trump appealed the tax bills. The news outlet then compared the tax documents with loan records that became public when Trump's lender sold debt on the properties.\n\nWhat they found:\n\nReal estate experts told the news outlet that there can be legitimate reasons for figures to differ between tax and loan documents, but that they didn't see obvious explanations for some of the discrepancies with Trump's properties.\n\nProPublica said that the Trump Organization didn't comment on the record to the news outlet's detailed questions.\n\nWhy it matters: Trump is involved in multiple lawsuits in an effort to prevent House Democrats and New York prosecutors from obtaining his tax returns and financial records.\n\nAt a congressional hearing earlier this year, the president's former lawyer, Michael Cohen Michael Dean CohenNY prosecutors urge appeals court not to block subpoena for Trump's tax returns Ronan Farrow book: National Enquirer shredded documents related to Trump Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy MORE, said that Trump would inflate the value of his assets for insurance purposes and deflate the value for tax purposes.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) oversight with agency Director Kathy Kraninger, 10 a.m.\n\nA House Financial Services subcommittee holds a hearing on the effects of stock buybacks, 10 a.m.\n\nA House Small Business subcommittee holds a hearing entitled \"Can Opportunity Zones Address Concerns in the Small Business Economy?\" 10 a.m.\n\nA House Financial Services subcommittee holds a hearing on diversity in the U.S. workforce, 2 p.m.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nTensions flare as Democrats urge consumer bureau to boost penalties: Tensions flared at a House committee hearing Wednesday as Democrats accused a powerful federal watchdog of shirking its obligation to protect consumers from financial fraud.\n\nA House Financial Services Committee hearing with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Kathy Kraninger quickly devolved after a top Democratic congresswoman insisted the bureau had abandoned its mission under her watch.\n\n\"If you're not following direction from your staff to help consumers that are harmed, then you are absolutely worthless,\" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney Carolyn Bosher MaloneyNew York Democratic congresswoman hospitalized Cast and crew of 'Unbelievable' join lawmakers to advocate for reducing DNA, rape kit backlog O'Rourke gun confiscation talk alarms Democrats MORE (D-N.Y.). I'll take you to the contentious hearing here.\n\nThe showdown: Maloney was referencing Kraninger's decision to not seek payback for consumers in a January legal settlement with Enova International, an online lender accused of illegally collecting debts from consumers.\n\nWhile Kraninger approved a $3.2 million fine, she did not seek restitution for consumers, despite recommendations from career staff to do so, according to documents released by the committee Wednesday.\n\nThe backlash: Republicans erupted after Maloney rebuked Kraninger's leadership.\n\nPosey then accused the Democrats of treating Kraninger with a \"double standard\" after Cordray set \"a new level of bureaucratic petulance, arrogance, and defiance.\"\n\nLawmakers on the panel have battled for years over the CFPB and its immense authority, and Wednesday's hearing highlighted the partisan rancor that has overshadowed the agency.\n\nNonetheless, Maloney apologized to Kraninger, explaining she did not \"intend to say that [she] was worthless.\"\n\n\"I only intended to echo the chairman's point about the bureau making consumers whole. I didn't intend to disrespect the director personally, and I'm sorry for the confusion that my statement caused.\"\n\nCritics pounce as Facebook crypto project stumbles: Facebook's ambitious plan to launch a global virtual currency is faltering under growing skepticism from business partners, politicians and financial regulators.\n\nAs the founders of Project Libra move toward a planned 2020 launch, crucial financial industry backers have bailed on the cryptocurrency system as Facebook faces rising threats from Washington.\n\nFacebook's critics across the political spectrum were elated after Mastercard, Visa, eBay, Stripe and PayPal all pulled out of the virtual currency project this month.\n\nThe project has also raised alarms among financial regulators, who urged the company to tread carefully or risk a federal crackdown. And it all comes as Trump administration officials and lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned with Facebook's immense market power and global reach.\n\nFacebook has sought to distance Libra from its poisonous reputation, highlighting the other partners in the project. But Facebook's missteps have left the company with little credibility among politicians and K Street insiders.\n\n\"That's bullshit. I don't think anybody buys that at all,\" said a financial technology industry lobbyist. \"As much as Facebook wants to say that this isn't a Facebook program, they're putting their CEO up to answer for it.\"\n\nThe Hill's Emily Birnbaum and I have more here.\n\nRead more: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHouse investigators receive initial documents from top tech companies Hillicon Valley: Warren turns up heat in battle with Facebook | Instagram unveils new data privacy feature | Advocacy group seeks funding to write about Big Tech Warren turns up heat over Facebook's ad rules MORE met with Rep.
