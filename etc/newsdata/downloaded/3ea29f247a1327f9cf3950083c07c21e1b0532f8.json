But it was still nothing on Fred Goodwin with his corporate jet and his scallop kitchen.\n\nDespite all its woes, Metro is ploughing on with its \u2018banking revolution\u2019.\n\nIt recently opened new outlets around Birmingham, with more in Manchester and Liverpool scheduled by the end of the year.\n\nIn truth, though, it is fighting for its future after an enormous accounting error. Hill, who is a top ten investor, has lost heavily on his shares, and announced last week he will step down entirely from the board.\n\nPreviously he had promised to quit as chairman but wanted to remain as president.\n\nThat idea was untenable, as has now been acknowledged. His presence would have been a stumbling block in recruiting a new chairman \u2013 no City heavyweight worth their salt wants a back-seat driver.\n\nThe rumours that Hill is trying to take Metro private, presumably with himself at the helm, will make the search for a new chairman even harder.\n\nPossible candidates include Lord Myners and Richard Pym, both veterans of the financial crisis and both involved in sorting out the Co-op Bank debacle.\n\nA torrid year: Despite all its woes, Metro is ploughing on with its \u2018banking revolution\u2019\n\nIf a replacement for Hill is not found by the end of the year \u2013 and assuming it has not been taken private \u2013 then one of the non-executives will step up, probably senior independent director Sir Michael Snyder, a former top accountant.\n\nOther big hitters on the board include Lord Flight, City grandee and former shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, ex-Friends Provident director Ben Gunn and building society luminary Stuart Bernau.\n\nMetro has averted an immediate crisis, as it managed to raise much-needed capital last week, with a \u00a3350m bond issue \u2013 although the interest costs are likely to wipe out profits until 2021.\n\nBut more trouble lies ahead.\n\nCity regulators are investigating the accounting error and, ominously, their probe has been widened to look at the conduct of senior managers.\n\nThe traditional solution for small banks that run into difficulty is to be taken over by a larger one.\n\nHowever, the big High Street players will not find Metro an appetising prospect, as the last thing they want is more branches. It might be a target for private equity or it could be picked up by an overseas operator wanting a presence in the UK.\n\nChallenger banks were meant to be part of the post-crisis solution to the toxic dominance of the big banks. It hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nCo-op Bank was the victim of its own poor management, TSB was hit by an IT meltdown and now Metro is another ninepin.\n\nWe have to hope the fintech challengers fare better. Whatever the outcome for Metro, it would be a tragedy if, after all the scandal and disgrace, customers remain at the mercy of the Big Four.", "description": "Tense times are ahead for Metro Bank as it searches for a new chairman to take over from Vernon Hill, who launched the bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis in a blaze of razzmatazz.", "authors": ["Ruth Sunderland For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
