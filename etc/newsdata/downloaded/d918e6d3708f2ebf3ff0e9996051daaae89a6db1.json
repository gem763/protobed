The good news: It hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nAfter age 21, there really aren\u2019t a lot of birthdays to look forward to.\n\nBut that\u2019s all about to change.\n\nA round-up of recent sex research from online platform Happify, addressed a super-important question: When do people have the best sex of their lives?\n\nAccording to people in their 50s and 60s (aka those who would know), the best sex of their lives happened in their 40s \u2013 specifically at age 46. Damn!\n\nThe round-up featured a slew of other cool factoids about sex. Among them, couples that do the cheeky once a week, on average, are the happiest.\n\nSo seriously, don\u2019t sweat it if you\u2019re not doing it every day like your super-loud neighbours. (We get it, you like each other.)\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a good reason to keep getting dirty between the sheets: The round-up found that older couples that have regular sex are happier than those who do it less often.\n\nOn a final note, nearly 50% of couples said the best sex of their lives was with their current partner \u2013 regardless of age.\n\nSo, as you near that epic 46th birthday, be sure to choose your lover wisely.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthmag.com\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "The bad news: It hasn\u2019t happened yet.
