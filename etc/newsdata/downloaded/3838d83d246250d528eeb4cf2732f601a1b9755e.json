(AP) - Actor Judd Nelson says he doesn\u2019t share the misgivings about \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d that co-star Molly Ringwald expressed in a first-person column.\n\nIn April 2018, Ringwald wrote a column for The New Yorker about watching the movie a few years earlier with her then 10-year-old daughter. Her discomfort focuses on interactions that her character had with a bad boy portrayed by Nelson.\n\nIn an interview with The StarNews of Wilmington , Nelson says he thinks the 1985 movie is \u201ca product of its time\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t \u201csee those problems that Molly sees.\u201d\n\nThe 59-year-old Nelson is in Wilmington to star in the play \u201cLove Letters\u201d which will be performed Saturday at Kenan Auditorium. His co-star in the two-person drama is Sheryl Lee, who played Laura Palmer in \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Actor Judd Nelson says he doesn't share the misgivings about \"The Breakfast Club\" that co-star Molly Ringwald expressed in a first-person column.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
