The federal agency said consumers could consider taking another heartburn medicine or contact their doctor.\n\nHealth Canada also said it was investigating the possible presence of a carcinogen in some ranitidine drugs available by prescription and over-the-counter. The agency issued a precautionary request last month for companies to stop distributing the medication.\n\nSeveral drugstore chains have already removed Zantac and generic versions from store shelves.", "description": "Health Canada said it was investigating the possible presence of a carcinogen in some ranitidine drugs available by prescription and over-the-counter.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327448.1571445910!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/zantac-recall-sanofi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
