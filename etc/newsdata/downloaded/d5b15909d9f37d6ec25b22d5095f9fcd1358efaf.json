(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)\n\nThe Sooner Schooner had a scary moment after Oklahoma\u2019s fourth touchdown of the day against West Virginia.\n\nAs is custom at Oklahoma home games, the Schooner took a quick lap on the field after the score. But as the schooner made its turn back toward the tunnel the radius was a little too tight and the schooner took quite the tumble.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDOWN GOES THE SOONER SCHOONER pic.twitter.com/egmf4rEXfg \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 19, 2019\n\nEveryone appeared to avoid significant injury in the accident. Here it is from a different angle. The horses kept doing their job and ran back to the tunnel while the wagon was tipped over on the field. The woman in the schooner flew a considerable distance. And the guys running around the schooner, uh, seemed a bit more worried about the wagon than they did about her.\n\nHopefully everyone is OK. This woman went tumbling. pic.twitter.com/4vF8CqDRlN \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 19, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s a field-level view of the accident and the aftermath. The wheels literally came off the schooner. And thankfully others did check on the woman for more than a brief second.\n\nThe Sooner Schooner crashed on the field during the second quarter of OU's game against West Virginia: pic.twitter.com/YTyrAoBvLL \u2014 OU Daily Sports (@OUDailySports) October 19, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThe schooner was carried out of the stadium a short time later and a reporter for the Oklahoman said he was told everyone involved in the incident was OK. The school released a statement about the crash Saturday afternoon.\n\nOfficial statement from OU Athletics: The Sooner Schooner tipped over today. We believe it was the result of weight distribution among riders in the rear of the wagon. Three individuals were evaluated at the stadium and released. All others reported that they were uninjured.(1/2) \u2014 Oklahoma Sooners (@OU_Athletics) October 19, 2019\n\n(2/2) Upon initial evaluation, it also appears the ponies are uninjured. Medical staff responded immediately as did the expert horse handlers and veterinarian who staff all games. We are grateful that the injuries were not serious and for the staff members who responded so well. \u2014 Oklahoma Sooners (@OU_Athletics) October 19, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s the third straight season there has been an in-game Sooner Schooner issue. This man was dragged behind the schooner \u2014 while still waving his flag! \u2014 in 2018.\n\nHopefully everyone is OK. This woman went tumbling. pic.twitter.com/4vF8CqDRlN \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 19, 2019\n\nAnd then in 2017, the schooner broke down on the field after a touchdown.\n\nOklahoma beats Texas Tech 49-27.\n\n\n\nThe Sooner Schooner needed some roadside assistance.\n\n\n\nOU is 7-1. pic.twitter.com/ZQvnI5Atoy \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 29, 2017\n\nHopefully what happened on Saturday is the only 2019 issue for the schooner. Given how often Oklahoma\u2019s offense finds the end zone, it\u2019s going to be making a lot more trips on the field the rest of the season.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Schooner suffered a scary fall after Oklahoma's fourth TD of the game.", "authors": ["Nick Bromberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EvYDJwlfFOvbXJ8jvGWJXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dGHrPYXhZurzk40xDysDdg--~B/aD0yMDA5O3c9MzAxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/bcc81970-f295-11e9-8b7e-652190feeaa1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
