Two people remained missing as search teams prepared to enter the building in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe are still in rescue mode,\u201d New Orleans Fire Department chief Timothy McConnell said at a news conference, adding later, \u201cThis is not a short-term event; this is a marathon.\u201d\n\nAuthorities responded just after 9 a.m. local time to the Hard Rock Hotel downtown, where the upper six to eight floors had collapsed, McConnell said. Video and photos capture a cloud of gray dust billowing out as wreckage falls onto the road.\n\nThose taken to the hospital are in stable condition, officials said. Nineteen people were evaluated for injuries, but one person was not transported.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, one of three people initially reported missing was found to have made it to the hospital independently, said Emily Nichols, a physician with New Orleans Emergency Medical Services. Others sought treatment on their own as well, bringing the injured tally into the \u201cdouble digits,\u201d she said.\n\nSome patients have been discharged, she added.\n\nThe person killed worked in the building, according to McConnell.\n\nOfficials had warned earlier in the day that a 270-foot crane on site still could collapse, asking that people stay away from the scene.\n\n\u201cThis remains a very fluid and very dangerous situation, and every few minutes something is falling off of this building,\u201d Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) told reporters midday.\n\nEngineers have determined that parts of the hotel are stable enough to send in search crews with dogs, McConnell said several hours later. Officials believe one of the missing people is alive in that area, he said, while the other is thought to be alive in a location not yet deemed stable, he said.\n\nSome surrounding buildings were evacuated by fire personnel, city emergency preparedness campaign NOLA Ready said on Twitter.\n\nThe collapse occurred at Canal and North Rampart streets at the southwestern edge of the French Quarter, the organization said.", "description": "Two people remained missing as search teams prepared to enter the building in the afternoon.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Pm", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
