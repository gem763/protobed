The second intelligence official is said to have more direct knowledge of the call, The Times reported.\n\nThe first complaint was released to the public last week and centres around a now infamous July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During their conversation, Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption. He also asked Zelensky to look into an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 election and that it did so to help Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. This complaint has now become the centre of an impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week.\n\nTrump also told Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in the matter as well as US Attorney General William Barr. Giuliani is mentioned 31 times in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and is described as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in Trump\u2019s efforts. Barr \u201cappears to be involved as well,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nThe White House released a summary of the phone call last week that largely corroborates the main details of the complaint. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, also testified to Congress that the memo is \u201cin alignment\u201d with the complaint.\n\nThe official who filed the complaint did not directly witness the conversation but heard about it from multiple US officials with knowledge of the phone call and who raised concerns that the president was using the power of his office to urge a foreign country to manufacture dirt on a political rival ahead of an election.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
