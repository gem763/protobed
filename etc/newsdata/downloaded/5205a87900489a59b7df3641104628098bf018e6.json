Nobody complained as to their treatment.\u201d\n\nThe Divisional Court judgment said South Wales Police deployed the technology \u201cin an open and transparent way, with significant public engagement\u201d, for a limited time and specific purposes.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, in our view, the use of AFR Locate does entail infringement of Article 8 rights,\u201d the judgement read.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for facial recognition trials carried out by the Metropolitan Police in London, where a watchdog raised concerns that the public were not properly informed about its use, and had been viewed as suspicious for avoiding cameras.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
