It\u2019s still dangerous and there will be a prolonged effect on the coastline, he added.\n\n\u201cWe expect hurricane-force winds to potentially hit the coast of Florida and then a prolonged rain event combined with storm surge that\u2019s going to be very difficult as the storm starts to move northward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier Sunday morning, Hurricane Dorian was upgraded to a Category 5 storm after reaching maximum sustained winds of 160 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm also hit the northern islands of the Bahamas, which have started experiencing hurricane-force winds and torrential rain.\n\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

Acting FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor told Congress in June that the agency was shorthanded: \"We\u2019re probably short a few thousand employees.\"\n\nThat has been fixed, McAleenan said Sunday, and federal agencies are \u201cfully prepared.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian comes at a time when FEMA doesn\u2019t have a Senate-confirmed administrator. President Donald Trump said Friday he was OK with that. This will be the first hurricane Gaynor has overseen.\n\nAhead of Trump\u2019s Sunday visit to the FEMA headquarters in Washington, McAleenan told Raddatz, \u201cThe president\u2019s going to make that sure we're on the same page, that we\u2019re tracking this and that we\u2019re going to be ready.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a very experienced emergency response leadership team,\u201d McAleenan added on ABC.", "authors": ["Rishika Dugyala"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a6/80/22f04da24b3e8541dd3aeb9158ed/20190901-kevin-mcaleenan-ap-773.jpg"}
