What on earth could an alt-rock Orange County fashionista and a grizzled, fly-fishing, bro-country singer from Oklahoma have in common? But as we all know, the star-crossed showmancers are still going strong, many Voice seasons later \u2014 despite the fact that, now that Gwen is back as a coach this season, she and Blake are constantly sparring on the air.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s Battle Rounds, Gwen tried to explain her surprisingly successful dynamic with Blake while reflecting on the unlikely chemistry between two of her battlers. \u201cYou're super-straight, clean, and polite,\u201d she told baby-faced soul sweetheart Kiara Brown. \u201cAnd he's dirty, nasty\u201d \u2014 referring to sexy, earthy, all-grown-up reggae crooner Royce Lovett. \u201cSo, the contrast in the duet is working so amazingly. There's a chemistry. It's like me and Blake: We do not seem like we would be together, but yet we go together perfectly. It's like this weird contrast.\u201d\n\nThe weird contrast worked very well between Kiara and Royce, during a duet of Bob Marley\u2019s \"Turn Your Lights Down Low.\u201d It worked better than I had expected, frankly. Royce has been one of my favorite Season 17 contestants since the Blind Auditions, and his vocals, as Gwen\u2019s fellow coach John Legend pointed out, were \u201cmade for this song.\u201d I definitely preferred Royce\u2019s raw, husky voice and confident delivery over the laid-back Kiara, who\u2019d been repeatedly warned during rehearsals by Gwen and guest mentor will.i.am not to play it too safe. However, I must commend Kiara for heeding that advice: She totally stepped it up in the ring, and I witnessed a lot of growth from her during just one episode.\n\nGwen was impressed by Kiara\u2019s accelerated progress as well. \u201cIf you can unleash that much, you have more to unleash, and I'm so curious to see what that is. \u2026 I'm falling in love with you, just because of how hard you worked,\u201d Gwen told Kiara. Of course, Gwen still picked the more ready-for-prime-time Royce, \u201cbecause his voice has so much character, personality, and dynamics\u201d \u2014 but, since this is the first season in which coaches are allowed to save one contestant during the Battle Rounds, she tried to keep both contestants on her team, by using her one Save on Kiara.\n\nGwen may have gotten her wish, but then rival coach Kelly Clarkson also tried to steal Kiara\u2026 and Gwen made the foolish mistake of confessing to Kiara that she hadn\u2019t planned to use her Save this soon, because there was someone else on her team that she was \u201ctorn\u201d about. Whoops. \u201cI do want you to be able to use that Save, so I'm gonna go with Kelly,\u201d Kiara understandably decided after that revelation.\n\nOh well. At least the nice girl, Kiara, didn\u2019t finish last. And Gwen still has Royce. And, of course, Gwen will always have Blake.\n\nThese were the other Battles of Monday night:\n\nTeam Legend: Jared Herzog vs. Will Breman, \u201cTreat You Better\u201d\n\nJared sounded a bit too low and shaky at the beginning of this Shawn Mendes hit, though he gained momentum as the performance progressed. Will, on the other hand, was strong from the start and never faltered. His voice fit more comfortable with the song, and his falsetto was a pleasant surprise. Speaking of \u201cweird chemistry,\u201d though: I really liked the way these guys turned this routine into a playful battle, pushing each other out of the way as they fought over some imaginary love interest. Still, it was obvious that Jared was the one who\u2019d get pushed off the show for good.\n\nWINNER: Will\n\nTeam Blake: Marina Chello vs. Ricky Duran, \"Valerie\"\n\nLet me just say that after a zillion years of this song being attributed to Amy Winehouse and Mark Ronson, it was refreshing that Blake actually had these contestants perform the more stomping, skronky, pub-singalong version by the band that originally wrote and recorded it, the criminally underrated Zutons. But regardless of whatever \u2018Valerie\u201d version, or really whatever song, these two might have performed, Marina was still destined to outclassed by Ricky, a four-chair contestant. Ricky showcased a gravelly, gritty voice that Blake compared to that of the Black Crowes\u2019 Chris Robinson (one of my personal favorite rock \u2018n\u2019 roll belters of all time), and while Marina held her own and was better than she\u2019d been during her cruise-shippy audition, I was shocked that Blake used his Save on her \u2014 and that Kelly (unsuccessfully) tried to steal her! I still find it hard to imagine Marina lasting past the Knockout Rounds, but we\u2019ll see.", "description": "\"There's a chemistry... we go together perfectly.
