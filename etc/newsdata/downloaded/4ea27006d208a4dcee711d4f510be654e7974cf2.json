This is not what Virginia\u2019s women want.\n\nWhile Ms. Tran was testifying in favor of her bill before a committee, she admitted that if passed the measure would have made abortion legal up until the moment of birth in Virginia. Virginians don\u2019t want what amounts to infanticide.\n\nMs. Tran\u2019s bill would also have placed a woman experiencing difficulty in the third trimester of pregnancy at the mercy of the abortionist, who only makes money if a pregnancy is terminated. Current law protects women by assuring that two other physicians confirm any diagnosis.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Tran\u2019s bill eliminated informed consent. Currently, information about pregnancy, help from state and private organizations, and the development of the unborn baby can be given over the phone, and printed information can be mailed to the woman 72 hours in advance.\n\nKathy Tran is too extreme for the 42nd Congressional District of Virginia. We need to elect Steve Adragna on Nov. 5.\n\nCAROLE S. DENNER\n\nSpringfield, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
