It is designed to ensure that they move forward together to replace SMS with a next-generation messaging standard \u2014 including a promise to launch a new texting app for Android phones that supports it in 2020.\n\nI spoke on the phone with Doug Garland, general manager for the CCMI, to find out more about what this all means. RCS, if you don\u2019t know, is wickedly complicated on the backend from both a technical and (more importantly) a political perspective. But the CCMI\u2019s goal is to make all that go away for US consumers. Whether or not it can actually pull that off is more complicated.\n\nFirst and foremost, CCMI intends to ship a new Android app next year that will likely be the new default messaging app for Android phones sold by those carriers. It will support all the usual RCS features like typing indicators, higher-resolution attachments, and better group chat. It should also be compatible with the global \u201cUniversal Profile\u201d standard for RCS that has been adopted by other carriers around the world.\n\nGarland says that the CCMI will also work with other companies interested in RCS to make sure their clients are interoperable as well \u2014 notably Samsung and Google. That should mean that people who prefer Android Messages will be able to use that instead, but it sounds like there may be technical details to work out to make that happen.\n\nGoogle is a fascinating and perhaps telling omission from the press release. Up until this point, the primary advocate for RCS has been Google, which bet on it as the only platform-level messaging service for Android. It was a bet that carriers haven\u2019t backed until now. Verizon isn\u2019t supporting RCS on the Pixel 4 after doing so on the Pixel 3, for example. Google recently stopped waiting for carriers in the UK and France and rolled out RCS support for Android phones using its own servers.\n\nGoogle has been the world\u2019s biggest RCS advocate \u2014 and it was left out\n\nGoogle was unable to immediately provide comment on the CCMI. That in and of itself is telling \u2014 as is the fact that the word \u201cGoogle\u201d appears precisely zero times in the carriers\u2019 press release. Garland says that the company continues to be an ecosystem partner and that this release was focused on the carriers.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with all the ins and outs of RCS, let\u2019s quickly catch up. There are four critical problems with RCS:\n\nNot enough carriers have adopted it Those that have adopted it sometimes did so without adhering the the international standard for interoperability called the \u201cUniversal Profile.\u201d It is not end-to-end encrypted, so it\u2019s easy for governments to demand the contents of those text messages Apple has had precisely zero to say about it, which everybody has interpreted as code for \u201clol we have iMessage good luck with that RCS thing bye!\u201d\n\nThe CCMI neatly fixes both the first and the second problem. Garland says that the carriers believe there are some implementation issues with the Universal Profile that the CCMI can address more elegantly, as its standard will be \u201cbased\u201d on it rather than necessarily following it down to the letter.\n\nAs for encryption, Garland wouldn\u2019t commit. He emphasizes that the CCMI intends to make sure that the chats are \u201cprivate\u201d and that the app it\u2019s making is \u201can experience [customers] can trust.\u201d\n\nFinally: Apple. There\u2019s still no word directly from the company in response to our request for comment. Garland can only say that \u201cwe would certainly be interested in having Apple\u201d support RCS.\n\nIn their press releases, all of the carriers point out that RCS offers them business opportunities \u2014 that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been hearing about for a while. Chatting with a business is much more convenient than calling, but doing so over SMS would be a nightmare. CCMI intends to offer a one-stop shop to let businesses offer services and support to consumers over text \u2014 and surely will charge those businesses for the opportunity.\n\nThe idea is you could chat with a business is also the key to understanding why the CCMI exists in the first place. That was actually my first question to Garland. If the the Universal Profile already exists, why create a whole new industry group to implement it? Garland pointed first to the CCMI\u2019s ability to provide services to businesses that want to chat directly with consumers.\n\nThe joint venture exists to make it easier for businesses to use RCS to chat with customers\n\nIt\u2019s a lucrative opportunity, since asking lots of companies to set up services separately with every carrier (or, ahem, Google) is likely one of the things holding business adoption of RCS back.\n\nIt\u2019s also a risky opportunity, as the last notable time all four carriers got together in a joint venture was to create a payments system (originally called ISIS) that flopped. There is some small reason for optimism, however: the stakes for getting messaging right are much higher for the carriers. Literally their core business is helping people communicate, after all.\n\nThere\u2019s reason for optimism but there\u2019s also reason to be worried. Carrier-made apps are notorious for being terrible, filled with ads and upsells. The CCMI says that \u201cmore details will be announced a later date.\u201d We\u2019ll be watching to see what the app situation will be, when exactly in 2020 it will launch, and whether Google (or even Apple) will have anything to say about it.", "description": "CCMI intends to ship a new Android app next year that will be the new default messaging app for Android phones sold by those carriers.
