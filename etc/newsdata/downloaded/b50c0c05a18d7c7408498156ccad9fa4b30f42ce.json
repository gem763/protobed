This year\u2019s race is no exception with mountain stages stretching from start to finish.\n\nThe second stage will take the peloton around Nice with three climbs - Col de la Colmiane, Col de Turini and Col d\u2019Eze - on the menu, giving early opportunities to the overall contenders.\n\nThere will be two mountain-top finishes in the opening six days, a rarity in Tour de France history. That should not suit Dutchman Tom Dumoulin, who fares well in the mountains but makes his mark in time trials.\n\nThe race will stay within French borders and avoid the northern part of the country but will go through all five mountain ranges \u2014 Alps, Pyrenees, Vosges, Jura and Massif Central \u2014 making the 2020 Tour a rollercoaster that could also favor Julian Alaphilippe.\n\nThe Frenchman spent 14 days in the yellow jersey this year and the undulating nature of the 2020 race, with only four hill-top finishes, will suit his aggressive style.\n\nThe queen stage, however, might prove too much of an effort for Alaphilippe as it will take the riders to 2,304 meters above sea level with a finish in Meribel, at the top of the Col de la Loze, a brutal 21.5-km climb at an average gradient of 7.8%.\n\nThe race starts a week earlier than usual because of the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe last stage will also end around 1915 (local time), instead of 2115 last year, because some riders will be flying straight to Tokyo afterwards,\u201d added Prudhomme.", "description": "Tour de France organizers put a spring in the step of the climbers on Tuesday after unveiling the route for the 2020 race featuring a first mountain stage on the second day and only one time trial on the eve of the final parade on the Champs Elysees.", "authors": ["Julien Pretot", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441061143&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0MK-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
