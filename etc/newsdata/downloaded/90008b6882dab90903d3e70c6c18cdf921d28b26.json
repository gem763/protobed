Overall it was a 6/10 performance- decent, but with even better expected in the future.", "description": "The 22-year-old had only previously played in the Carabao Cup and Europa League but finally got the nod for the starting XI against Crystal Palace", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740100.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
