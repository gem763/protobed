Cernekee didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe agreement comes after former Google employee Kevin Cernekee filed a complaint last year, alleging the company restricted free speech and fired him for expressing conservative views. Google claims that Cernekee was fired for violating multiple policies, including using a personal device to download company documents. Last month, Google issued revised community guidelines , discouraging employees from engaging in a \"raging debate over politics or the latest news story\" and to avoid conversations that are generally disruptive.\n\nGoogle reached the settlement with the NLRB on Thursday, but the filing wasn't made public until Friday. The company must post the list of policies at its headquarters in Mountain View, California, as well as its Nest Labs offices in Palo Alto. In settling, Google \"does not admit that it has violated the National Labor Relations Act or any other law,\" the filing said.\n\nThe policies, including some that are new for the company, show Google must have clearer guidelines for employees, addressing a common complaint from former staffers who claimed management didn't adequately explain why there were terminated. One of the terms says Google is not allowed to interfere with employees' attempts to discuss workplace issues and topics like compensation.\n\nIn Google's agreement with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board to allow greater debate and more open discussion on campus, the company said it will post a list of more than 20 employees' rights and protections at its offices.\n\nAs part of the arrangement, Google is required to let employees speak with the media about their employment without getting permission, which marks a change for a company that has exercised tight restrictions over conversations with the press.\n\nThe company also has to say that it will comply with federal law, allowing employees to form, join or assist a union as well as \"act together with other employees\" for their \"benefit and protection.\" Former employees have claimed that they faced retaliation for speaking out about workforce issues, including organizing the companywide walkout last year to protest Google's handling of sexual harassment.\n\nA Google spokesperson said in a statement on Friday that it has agreed to a proposed settlement with the NLRB about Cernekee's complaint, but the company is going out of its way to say that it's not referencing political discourse in the new policies.\n\n\"There is absolutely no mention of political activity in the proposed settlement, and the updates we made to our Community Guidelines are completely unrelated and unaffected,\" the spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nHere's what Google agreed to print and post at its offices:\n\nFEDERAL LAW GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO: Form, join, or assist a union;\n\nChoose a representative to bargain with us on your behalf;\n\nAct together with other employees for your benefit and protection;\n\nChoose not to engage in any of these protected activities.

WE WILL remove from our files all references to the final written warning issued to the Charging Party on August 19, 2015, and WE WILL notify him in writing that this has been done and that the final written warning will not be used against him in any way.
