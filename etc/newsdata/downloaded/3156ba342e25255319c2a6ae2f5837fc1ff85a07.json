Benett/Getty Images for V&A) More\n\nHodgson went on to explain what the term means to her: \u201cThe definition of sapiosexuality doesn\u2019t mean not physical attraction \u2014 it means intelligence first. So that\u2019s how I identify. Intelligence for me is the most important attractive trait in a person \u2014 and I\u2019ve dated men, women, trans men, trans women, across the gender spectrum... the thing that has linked all these people that I have dated has been their brains.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing the term while waiting backstage, Oscar- and Grammy-winning producer Ronson and some of the show\u2019s producers reportedly started talking about it. \u201cWe were all arguing backstage in the dressing room with a couple of your producers,\u201d the 44-year-old said when he appeared on the show to promote his new album, Late Night Feelings. \u201cAnd yes, I feel like I am identifying as sapiosexual.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d co-host Ben Shephard then proceeded to congratulate Ronson for \u201ccoming out as sapiosexual\u201d on the show, followed by co-host Kate Garraway saying, \u201cHe\u2019s out and proud.\u201d\n\nSo what, exactly, does sapiosexual mean? Sapiosexuality is described as being sexually attracted to a person\u2019s intelligence over their looks or gender identity. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary: \u201c'Sapiosexual', a term that means \u2018sexually attracted to highly intelligent people,\u2019 is becoming increasingly popular. That doesn't mean that the phenomenon it describes is new.\u201d\n\nSapiosexuality \u201cremoves gender identity as well as looks from the equation of romantic attraction,\u201d noted Merriam-Webster.\n\nThe term was reportedly coined by a LiveJournal writer named Wolfieboy, who claims he came up with it in 1998.\n\nSapiosexuality garnered attention when dating site OkCupid expanded its list of sexual orientations back in November 2014 to include it as an option (there\u2019s even a dating app dedicated to sapiosexuals, appropriately called \u201cSapio\u201d).\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees that sapiosexuality \u2014 which has been described by detractors as \u201cclassist\u201d and \u201ca layer of pretension on top of a more traditional sexual identity\u201d \u2014 should be designated as a separate sexual orientation.\n\nAs Daily Beast writer Samantha Allen writes: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a special word \u2014 especially one modeled after minority identity labels like \u2018homosexual\u2019 and \u2018bisexual\u2019 \u2014 to describe a completely normative facet of human attraction. In the modern world, identifying as sapiosexual has about as much semantic utility as claiming that you are kind-sexual, dependable-sexual, or rich-sexual.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Musician Mark Ronson shared that he considers himself sapiosexual, meaning he's attracted to a person's intelligence over looks or gender.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/73bDgQTUyrYFAUue9GrdTg--~B/aD03MDk7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/b28d16c0-dbc2-11e9-bb35-28e3f7e9898d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
