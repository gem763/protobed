Another wrote, \u201cI need my JUUL. I get a headache everytime I lose it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found many self-reported symptoms of nicotine dependence,\u201d said co-author A. Everette James, director of the Pitt Health Policy Institute in a statement. \u201cBecause of the lack of public knowledge about the dependence risks, it makes sense that many people seemed surprised about experiencing symptoms of withdrawal when they could not use their device.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the FDA has accused Juul of deceptive marketing practices that led to this public misconception about e-cigarette safety in its warning letter to CEO Kevin Burns that was released Monday.\n\nAfter reviewing Juul\u2019s two days of testimony at the U.S. House in July, FDA investigators determined that Juul broke the law by selling or distributing its products \u201cas modified risk tobacco products without an FDA order in effect that permits such sale or distribution.\u201d\n\nActing FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless wrote in a strongly-worded statement that \u201cregardless of where products like e-cigarettes fall on the continuum of tobacco product risk, the law is clear that, before marketing tobacco products for reduced risk, companies must demonstrate with scientific evidence that their specific product does in fact pose less risk or is less harmful. Juul has ignored the law, and very concerningly, has made some of these statements in school to our nation\u2019s youth.\u201d\n\nThe examples of such statements, which were drawn from Congressional testimony, included a Juul rep telling students at a school presentation that Juul \u201cwas much safer than cigarettes,\u201d \u201ctotally safe,\u201d and that the \u201cFDA would approve it any day.\u201d What\u2019s more, a Juul representative told a student that he \u201cshould mention Juul to his [nicotine-addicted] friend \u2026 because that\u2019s a safer alternative than smoking cigarettes, and it would be better for the kid to use.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a 2018 Stanford study noted that Juul products deliver more nicotine than competing brands of e-cigs, and produce a \u201cthroat hit\u201d that is more comparable to conventional cigarettes. It warned that teens and young adults didn't recognize the product\u2019s addictive potential. And the University of California-Riverside reported in April that the long-term health effects of e-cigarette use are still unknown, and warned that the nicotine concentrations in Juul products are high enough to potentially damage cells in developing adolescent brains.\n\nThe FDA and CDC are also looking into 450 possible cases of severe vaping-related lung disease, including five deaths, across 33 states and one territory. The CDC called on consumers to avoid using all e-cigarettes or electronic devices that deliver nicotine on Friday, while the FDA urged people to avoid using vaping products containing THC. San Francisco banned sales of e-cigarettes completely in June.\n\nRelated: Amid rising reports of a vaping-related lung illness, here\u2019s how to kick your e-cigarette addiction\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the number of high schoolers using e-cigarettes increased by 78% between 2017 and 2018, according to the CDC, while the number of middle schoolers spiked 48%. And an earlier study from the University of Pittsburgh found that a quarter of Juul\u2019s Twitter followers are under the legal age of 18. \u201cThis is highly concerning because adolescents exposed to e-cigarette marketing are more likely to use e-cigarettes and, in turn, young adults who use e-cigarettes are four times as likely as their non-vaping peers to transition to smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes,\u201d wrote the lead author.\n\nThe FDA is giving Juul two weeks to respond to its warning letter, which includes fully describing its corrective actions. A Juul Labs spokesperson told MarketWatch that, \u201cWe are reviewing the letters and will fully cooperate,\u201d with the FDA. The company also recently announced that it will introduce a new age-verification system to keep minors from buying its products.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto E-cigarettes are popular with younger customers.\n\nDr. Ravi Kalhan, a professor of medicine and director of the Asthma and COPD Program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, also blames consumer confusion about e-cigarette safety on marketing from companies like Juul. \u201cThere has been an unregulated marketing force around these things that says vaping is safe, and safer than smoking,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cThe argument that vaping is safer than e-cigarettes is one that people are trying to apply logic to, but it\u2019s an assumption that\u2019s not scientifically driven,\u201d he added. \u201cVaporizing things used as pesticides and inhaling them is not logically safe. Inhaling anything other than air in your lungs is a bad idea, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nHe also takes issue with the idea that vaping can help someone end an addiction to nicotine, even if some e-cigs contain less nicotine than cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIf the argument is that these are a \u2018safe\u2019 way to help someone quit smoking, then they should be subjecting them [e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery products] to the same regulatory pressure as other things that are known to work, like nicotine replacement therapy,\u201d said Dr. Kalhan. \u201cThere are nicotine inhalers I can prescribe to someone that have been through the rigors of the FDA approval process of safety and efficacy, and you can feel pretty good about using them. The whole idea of e-cigs as a way to stop smoking has not been studied in a systematic way.\u201d", "description": "A new study says the brand\u2019s e-cig users show signs of addiction.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP910_Juul_0_ZG_20180912101711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
