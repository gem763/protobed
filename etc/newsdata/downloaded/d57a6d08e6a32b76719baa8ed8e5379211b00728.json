But France had a problem with that and wanted to wait until Monday/Tuesday to see what happens in London,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nA source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said: \u201cFrance wants a justified and proportionate extension. However, we have nothing of the sort so far. We must show the British that it is up to them to clarify the situation and that an extension is not a given.\u201d\n\nMacron has previously managed to sway the bloc\u2019s extension decisions, meaning options range from two weeks to the three months - to Jan. 31, 2020 - requested by Johnson, or longer should it be clear that Britain is headed for an election.\n\nAny delay can only be granted unanimously and it could come as little as 60 hours before Britain is due to leave.\n\nBLANK DATE\n\nAccording to a draft document seen by Reuters ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting, a delay was to be granted \u201cwith the view to allowing for the finalization of the ratification\u201d of the divorce agreement sealed with Johnson last week.\n\nThe draft text left the Brexit date blank, but said the split could take place earlier if ratification was completed, an idea dubbed a flexible extension or \u201cflextension\u201d.\n\nUnion Jack flags are seen outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nA two-tier delay was also on the cards, meaning one decision might come with two possible dates for Brexit, depending on if and when the deal is ratified.\n\n\u201cThis extension excludes any reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d the draft decision said, reminding Britain it would remain a full, paying member state until it leaves and should not seek to stall EU decisions.\n\nThe EU is intent on preventing the most damaging no-deal split, but it is also tired of the intractable divorce.\n\nA joke in that spirit was being shared among EU diplomats: \u201cThe year is 2192. The British prime minister visits Brussels to ask for an extension of the Brexit deadline. No one remembers where this tradition originated, but every year it attracts many tourists from all over the world.\u201d\n\nMore than three years after Britons voted 52%-48% to be the first country to leave the European project, the future of Brexit is unclear and the country bitterly divided.\n\nJohnson won the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party in July with a pledge to get Brexit done by Oct. 31, but parliament\u2019s rejection of his timetable on Tuesday means he will fail to do that.\n\nHis predecessor Theresa May resigned after parliament defeated her Brexit deal three times, forcing delays from an initial Brexit date of March 29.\n\nJohnson told opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn he would give parliament more time to approve his Brexit deal by Nov. 6 if lawmakers back a December election in a vote on Monday, his third attempt at forcing a snap poll.\n\nAnti-brexit and pro-EU protesters shelter from the rain outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nCorbyn replied he would wait to see what the EU does on a Brexit delay before deciding which way to vote, repeating that he could only back an election when the risk of a no-deal Brexit was off the table.\n\nIt is not clear how Corbyn will respond now the EU has shelved its decision on a new Brexit date. A spokesman for Johnson said he would push ahead with plans to leave the EU if lawmakers reject a pre-Christmas election.\n\nLadbrokes said betting odds indicated an election in 2020.", "description": "The European Union agreed on Friday to London's request for a Brexit deadline extension but set no new departure date, giving Britain's divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for a snap election.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444820782&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0DB", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
