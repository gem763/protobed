In Monday night\u2019s debate, some of those views earned him boos from the audience. As AP reported:\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Ron Paul says he will make deep cuts to the military budget even though many voters in South Carolina and elsewhere are employed by the military.\n\nThe Texas congressman was grilled Monday on his position on military spending during a nationally televised presidential debate. He has called for closing bases overseas and reducing spending on what he calls the military industrial complex.\n\nPaul said he wants to protect military jobs domestically and insists there\u2019s a difference between military spending and a strong national defense.\n\nPaul said conservatives should insist on cutting spending on military projects, not just domestic spending. He said overseas military spending should be cut before trimming federal jobless benefits for the long-term unemployment.\n\nRon Paul\u2019s foreign policy views, which diverge from the rest of his rivals and most of the GOP base, hurt him repeatedly in the debate. As Chris Cillizza explained in his winners and losers analysis:\n\nRon Paul: Ugh. We don\u2019t often feel bad for politicians \u2014 after all, they are putting themselves out there and inviting public scrutiny \u2014 but we felt some pangs for the Texas Republican Congressman tonight.\n\nHis answers on foreign policy were repeatedly booed and Perry even suggested that a gong should have been used to cut Paul off. While Paul-ites undoubtedly cheered their hero\u2019s willingness to stand up for what he believes in when it comes to U.S. involvement in foreign countries, it\u2019s just not a majority position \u2014 or anywhere close to it \u2014 in the Republican electorate of South Carolina.\n\nWe\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: If Paul would deflect all foreign policy questions and turn every answer into something about his economic views, he could be a real contender for the nomination. He won\u2019t do that, so he isn\u2019t.\n\nAudience: The Fix is pro-audience involvement \u2014 to a point. Tonight\u2019s debate went beyond that point. Not only were moderators booed for asking questions \u2014 just doing their jobs, folks \u2014 but it became clear after about 15 minutes that Gingrich, Perry and, to a lesser extent, Santorum were all vamping for crowd reaction in each of their answers.\n\nThe result? Lots of conservative red meat thrown on the debate stage but not a lot of serious and detailed discussion that went beyond the candidates\u2019 talking points.\n\n(Sidebar: The level of audience involvement hurt Romney. Unlike his rivals who have nothing to lose by throwing out every rhetorical excess known to man, he has to be far more measured \u2014 knowing the Obama opposition research team is always watching.)\n\nPaul and his campaign have hammered again and again the message of small government and reduced spending. Some see his position undermined by his use of first class travel for trips to his home state. As AP reported:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ron Paul has been spending large amounts on airfare as a congressman, flying first class on dozens of taxpayer-funded flights to his home state. The practice conflicts with the image that Paul portrays as the only presidential candidate serious about cutting federal spending.\n\nPaul flew first class on at least 31 round-trip flights and 12 one-way flights since May 2009 when he was traveling between Washington and his district in Texas, according to a review by The Associated Press of his congressional office expenses. Four other round-trip tickets and two other one-way tickets purchased during the period were eligible for upgrades to first-class after they were bought, but those upgrades would not be documented in the expense records.\n\nPaul, whose distrust of big government is the centerpiece of his presidential campaign, trusts the more expensive government rate for Continental Airlines when buying his tickets. Paul chose not to buy the cheaper economy tickets at a fraction of the price because they aren\u2019t refundable or as flexible for scheduling, his congressional staff said.\n\n\u201cWe always get him full refundable tickets since the congressional schedule sometimes changes quickly,\u201d said Jeff Deist, Paul\u2019s chief of staff. Paul might have to pay out of his own pocket for canceled flights in some cases if he didn\u2019t buy refundable tickets, Deist said.\n\nRead more on PostPolitics.com\n\n84 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Congress is doing, poll finds\n\nCan Newt Gingrich make another come back?\n\nFact Checking the Fox News-WSJ debate in South Carolina", "description": "Ron Paul has endeared himself to many by refusing to back down from policy ideas out of the GOP mainstream consensus.
