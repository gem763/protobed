And total viewership on Thursday was likely far higher, since Nielsen figures do not count online audiences and livestreams.\n\nBroadcasts of primary debates are, foremost, a civic service, offering voters an unexpurgated view of the candidates. But they also serve as tent pole events for the media organizations that sponsor them, a chance to showcase journalism and burnish the brand in front of some of the biggest audiences in news.\n\nNext month, a newcomer is joining the debate game: The New York Times.\n\nThe paper said on Friday that it planned to co-host, with CNN, next month\u2019s matchup in Westerville, Ohio, the fourth debate of the Democratic nominating contest. A pair of CNN anchors, Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett, will share moderating duties with The Times\u2019s national editor, Marc Lacey.", "description": "The New York Times will join CNN in co-sponsoring next month\u2019s debate in Ohio, another sign of the paper\u2019s expanded public profile.", "authors": ["Michael M.
