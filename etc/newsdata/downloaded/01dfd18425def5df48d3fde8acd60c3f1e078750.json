Let kids be kids ffs.' And another fumed: 'FFS! What a Princess Perfect! Disgusting!'", "description": "Luisa Zissman infuriated Good Morning Britain viewers but insisted she would never want her children to be ashamed of permanent blemishes and hates people putting their children on social media.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20366308-0-image-a-7_1572427176353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
