The incident occurred after Ovidio was captured by the Mexican military last Thursday and released hours later\n\nOvidio Guzm\u00e1n was arrested in Culiac\u00e1n last Thursday and immediately released by the government after the Sinaloa Cartel outnumbered the military and launched a war-like attack that left at least eight people dead and 16 people injured\n\nMexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said he is committed to the arrest of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n as long as no innocent lives are put at risk\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador said the decision to free Guzm\u00e1n halted the shootings and saved lives, and he would order another apprehension provided there is an arrest warrant for the operation and that the public is not put in danger.\n\n'People's lives must be looked after,' he said.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n is wanted on a United States arrest warrant after he and his brother were indicted in 2018 in Washington on charges of trafficking cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.\n\nThe indictment was unsealed on February 13 and covered the period from April 2008 to April 2018. At the time, the brothers' father, El Chapo, was running the Sinaloa cartel with co-founder Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada.\n\nThe criminal organization is now said to be run by El Chapo's two other sons, Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n, alongside Zambada.\n\nSources told the New York Times that after Iv\u00e1n was captured during the raid last week.\n\nIv\u00e1n was said to have organized what would become the substantial show of force that dragged on for eight hours, all in an effort to get his Ovidio released.\n\nMexicans have been at odds over the decision to free Ovidio and widely skeptical over the government's ability to contain escalating violence, according to an October 18-20 phone survey of 400 adults published on Monday by newspaper Reforma.\n\nIt found that 49% of respondents disagreed with the decision to release Ovidio, while 45% agreed with it. The poll also showed 56% of respondents felt that organized crime was stronger than the government, while one third took the opposite view.\n\nIn Culiac\u00e1n, where terrified residents dove to the floor or hid behind walls to escape the hail of gunfire, many breathed a sigh of relief that the government had relented.\n\nAt least 6,000 soldiers stepped foot in the northwestern city to reinforce security.\n\nAt least 6,000 soldiers stepped foot in the northwestern city of Culiac\u00e1n to reinforce security\n\nMunicipal cops walk the streets of Culiac\u00e1n during a class between armed groups and the Mexican military\n\nVideos (as seen above) emerged on social media of purported members of the Sinaloa Cartel taking to the streets with machine guns and grenade launchers\n\n'Now, three or four days afterward, people are saying it's good they didn't arrest him,' said Juan Carlos Ayala, a Culiac\u00e1n resident and Sinaloa University professor who studies the sociology of drug trafficking.\n\n'Beside the possibility of a massacre, it's good they didn't arrest him, because, in the end, this group (the Sinaloa cartel) is a necessary evil.'\n\nOther voices continued to condemn the government's decision as a capitulation to drug cartels.\n\n'The rule of law has given way to the rule of force,' said Luis Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez, head of the country's National Human Rights Commission.\n\n'Authorities who give up doing their job because of some individuals' resistance, that is the best recipe for continuing impunity and perpetuating violence,'Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez added.\n\nMarko Cortes, leader of the opposition National Action Party, said that 'the Mexican government was subjugated, forced to its knees, humiliated by a drug cartel.'\n\n'By freeing the son of Chapo Guzm\u00e1n, the Mexican people were condemned to suffering greater threats to their lives, peace and property,' Cortes said.\n\n'Sinaloa and other states were condemned to being ruled by drug traffickers.'", "description": "A driver in the Mexican resort town of\u00a0Mazatl\u00e1n recorded the moment he told a cop he was connected to El Chapo's son and was allowed to drive away from a checkpoint.", "authors": ["Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20044562-0-image-a-9_1571761509461.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
