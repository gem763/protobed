'Law enforcement indicated that none of our players were involved in the investigation.'", "description": "Brian Hronek, 48, was arrested Wednesday after police who searched his home said they found hundreds of lewd images of children as young as seven months old being raped by grown men.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/06/19871112-0-image-a-63_1571376794179.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
