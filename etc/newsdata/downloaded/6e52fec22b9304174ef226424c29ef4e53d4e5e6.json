The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told MPs that all stages of legislation to trigger an early general election would go through the Commons on Tuesday, adding: \u201cI can assure this House that we will not bring back the withdrawal agreement bill.\u201d Operation Yellowhammer, the plan to keep Britain running in the event of a no-deal Brexit, has been shelved.\n\nThe parties are still in dispute over the potential date \u2013 the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, is not happy with Johnson\u2019s preference, 12 December, which is after many universities have broken up for Christmas and students have returned to their home towns.\n\nMeanwhile Johnson\u2019s government is predicted to overshoot its deficit target by \u00a316bn this year after \u00a343bn was ripped from the Treasury by a series of spending pledges, an economic slowdown and the spiralling cost of student loans. The independent Resolution Foundation warns that the \u00a327bn allocated by then-chancellor Philip Hammond to cope with the costs of Brexit has evaporated and the Treasury looks set to break its rule capping the annual spending shortfall at 2% of GDP.\n\nShark bites off Briton\u2019s foot \u2013 A British tourist lost his foot as he and another Briton were mauled by a shark in the Whitsunday region of north Queensland. The two men, both in their 30s, were airlifted to hospital in the city of Mackay with serious lower leg injuries after being attacked on a day excursion to Hook Passage, about 30km from the resort of Airlie Beach. The attack took place about 10.20am Tuesday, local time.\n\nMajor failings allowed Grenfell disaster \u2013 The London fire brigade\u2019s readiness for the Grenfell Tower fire was gravely inadequate and fewer people would have died if it had been better prepared, the report into the disaster that killed 72 people has concluded. Contrary to evidence of the cladding manufacturer Arconic, the main reason the flames spread so rapidly up the building was its aluminium-polyethylene composite panels, wrote Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the retired judge heading the inquiry. Despite knowing about the dangers of cladding panels, the LFB had not prepared adequately. More lives could have been saved if firefighters had realised earlier the fire was out of control and ordered a full evacuation. Moore-Bick praised the \u201cextraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty\u201d of rank-and-file firefighters, both on the ground and in the control room. The second phase of the inquiry, which begins next year, will examine the refurbishment project that preceded the fire.\n\nTrump-Ukraine vote planned \u2013 The US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will call a vote to formalise the impeachment inquiry under way against Donald Trump. Republicans have argued the inquiry is invalid because the House didn\u2019t vote on it. \u201cThis argument has no merit,\u201d Pelosi said \u2013 no vote is required by the US constitution. But given White House obstruction of the inquiry, she would hold a vote to make clear the Trump administration must co-operate: \u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d Today the top Ukraine expert on the US national security council is expected to tell the inquiry that he \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen\u201d. According to a leaked statement, Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel and Purple Heart recipient, will say: \u201cI realised that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d\n\nCannabis no panacea \u2013 The use of cannabis medicines in the treatment of mental health issues carries more risks than benefits, a review of 40 years\u2019 worth of trials has found. Professor Louisa Degenhardt, lead author of the study, said of all research carried out there was only \u201clow-quality evidence\u201d of THC being helpful with conditions such as anxiety and depression, as opposed to \u201ca large body of research\u201d of its potential harms. \u201cThis research suggests that cannabis use can increase the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptom,\u201d says the paper. A well-constructed study found that smoked cannabis increased the risk of acute psychotic symptoms. Young adults, the age group more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression and psychosis, were more likely to become dependent if using cannabis daily over a long period of time.\n\nSmall details caught Baghdadi \u2013 The Kurdish army in Syria says one of its spies stole the underpants of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to get the DNA that was used to identify him. \u201cOur own source, who had been able to reach al-Baghdadi, brought al-Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure 100% that the person in question was al-Baghdadi himself,\u201d said Polat Can, a senior official in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Baghdadi blew himself up to avoid capture when US special forces swooped. Can said a decision to eliminate Baghdadi was made \u201cmore than a month ago\u201d but this was delayed when Donald Trump allowed Turkey to invade Kurdish-held territory in Syria. And the special forces dog that chased down Baghdadi has been celebrated as a hero. A photo has been released \u2013 but the canine\u2019s name remains classified.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Weinstein was just the beginning\n\nWhen Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a global reckoning on sexual harassment resulting in #MeToo.

Photograph: DPA/Alamy\n\nFrom 4-11 November the city will host more than 200 events to \u201ccelebrate and remember\u201d, including films and documentaries, photo exhibitions and concerts (including an appearance from Patti Smith), art installations and talks \u2013 taking place at Wall-related spots, such as the Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz, and the East Side Gallery. Paul Sullivan writes that the anniversary marks a great chance to see some fascinating and less well known reminders of a divided city.\n\nSport\n\nEngland\u2019s head coach, Eddie Jones, will not over-exert his players this week and admits aggressive South Africa will be \u201ca difficult side to beat\u201d in Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup final. Wayne Pivac will take over from Warren Gatland as Wales head coach after the tournament in Japan but, like his predecessor, he will find that he has to spot then develop his own Test players.\n\nSupporters\u2019 groups are to meet the Premier League today to demand action on VAR after another weekend of chaos beset video refereeing technology. The Liverpool midfielder James Milner is no fan of the technology and says it is ruining the atmosphere at matches. Aidan O\u2019Brien must travel to this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup without the animal he recently described as \u201cthe ultimate racehorse\u201d, Magical having been found to have a temperature shortly before she was due to fly. Simona Halep, the Wimbledon champion, valiantly saved a match point and recovered from a set down to defeat Bianca Andreescu, the US Open champion, in a dramatic battle at the WTA Finals. And Granit Xhaka\u2019s shocking fallout with Arsenal fans is born of frustration at the slow decline at the club caused by mismanagement on and off the pitch, writes Nick Ames.\n\nBusiness\n\nShares have been mixed in Asia with Chinese benchmarks falling after the S&P 500 index closed at an all-time high, ahead of a busy week of corporate earnings and economic reports, and expectation of another another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index has gained along with Taiwan, Bangkok and Singapore. There have been falls in Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea and Jakarta. The pound is worth $1.285 and \u20ac1.158 at time of writing. The FTSE is down a few points.\n\nThe papers\n\nAlmost every paper focuses on Boris Johnson\u2019s plan today to secure a pre-Christmas election \u2013 on 12 December to be exact. The Mail asks: \u201cCan Boris win his Christmas gamble?\u201d and reports that the prime minister is on the brink of sealing an election deal. The Guardian says Johnson has abandoned his Brexit bill in the hope that the move will curry enough favour with the Lib Dems and SNP to win a fresh push for an election. Other stories include heightened fears of Isis revenge attacks and the BBC equal pay row.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Tuesday 29 October 2019.\n\nThe Times carries the same line on Brexit in a single-column story, with a bravely deep picture of Johnson\u2019s furrowed brow eyeing No 10 but it splashes on findings suggesting aspirin can tackle depression symptoms. The Sun returns to the Jeremy Corbyn chicken theme with a \u201c12 Fright\u201d headline, accusing the Labour leader of running scared from an election. The Express says: \u201cPM: Bring it on for Dec 12!\u201d and reports that a defiant PM will today make attempt No 4 to go to the polls. Holly Willougby at the Pride of Britain awards gets the picture slot.\n\nThe i injects more doubt into the issue, focusing on senior Tories\u2019 fears that voters will punish the party if Johnson succeeds in calling an election. The FT adds a note of drama with the headline: \u201cJohnson raises stakes in fresh election gambit\u201d. The Mirror splashes on the Keith Vaz ban over the sex workers scandal, with the headline: \u201cNot fit to be an MP\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
