When called on, though, he has played significant roles, such as in 2008, when he helped organize a conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, of political figures and oil chief executives that helped calm markets after prices had hit record levels. Recently, he has been trying to resolve a dispute with Kuwait that has halted production by Chevron in the so-called partition zone between the two countries.\n\nCordial to other OPEC delegates and friendly if cautious with journalists, the prince mostly stayed out of the limelight in deference to oil ministers like Ali al-Naimi and Mr. Falih, who were nominally his superiors. Over the years, he has often been present at meetings of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or at the minister\u2019s side in parlays with oil company chief executives. In the past, he has rarely spoken for quotation but has directed reporters to the occasional uncontroversial speech he made at oil conferences.\n\nBassam Fattouh , director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, a research organization, said that the prince was likely to bring a different approach to areas like OPEC, where Mr. Falih alienated some members by his focus on Russia, a major oil producer but not a member of OPEC. \u201cHe will try to move away from this idea that the big boys make the decisions, and try to involve others,\u201d Mr. Fattouh said.
