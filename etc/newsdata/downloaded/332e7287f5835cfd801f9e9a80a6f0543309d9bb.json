Katie Hill becomes more of a circus.\n\nAnd California Gov. Gavin Newsom hasn\u2019t even set an election date yet.\n\nOnly three days after a revenge-porn scandal drove the freshman Democratic Congresswoman from office, over half a dozen people from the two major parties have already registered their bid to replace her.\n\nThat includes a wild-card last-minute addition to the crowd, official as of Tuesday evening: George Papadopoulos, the former aide to President Trump, who served two weeks in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI during its investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russian leaders.\n\nDemocrats will have to fight hard to keep control of California\u2019s 25th district, which is situated north of Los Angeles and, until Hill came along, had been represented by Republicans since the early \u201990s. Thanks to immense organizing power, a burgeoning Hispanic voter population, and a hell of a lot of money \u2014 over $7 million \u2014 32-year-old Hill won the district in last fall's midterms by over 4,000 votes.\n\nBut keeping the district blue isn\u2019t a certainty, in no small part because of the circumstances surrounding the special election.\n\nOn October 18, a conservative blog published nude photos of Hill, along with allegations that she\u2019d had a sexual relationship with a female campaign aide and a male legislative staffer. (Hill admitted the first allegation is true but denies the second.) She has maintained that \u201cGOP operatives\u201d worked in concert with her estranged husband to leak the intimate photos and oust her from office.\n\nWhat did George know?\n\nAnd onlookers are suggesting that Papadopoulos' actions prove Hill's claim: A full day before the blog published those photos, he tweeted, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s 25th congressional district looks like it\u2019s for the taking.\u201d\n\nA political journalist for Playboy has since reported that the right wing, including the California-based conservative radio host Jim Messina and the National Republican Campaign Committee, knew about the photos before they ran. And just after Hill announced last Sunday that she would resign, the conservative blogger who first published the nude photos of Hill urged her Twitter followers to \u201chelp us flip [Hill\u2019s] former CA-25 seat BACK to RED.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos, who\u2019s running as a Republican, urged supporters on his campaign website to \u201cHelp fight back against Democrat corruption by joining George\u2019s campaign today!\u201d\n\nHis campaign manager did not respond to VICE News\u2019 requests for comment about his knowledge of the photos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen from the revolving door of people who go in and out of the Trump administration ... that people are more than happy to elevate their own brand and get in front of a microphone whenever and however they can,\u201d said Christy Smith, the Democratic California aAssemblywoman who\u2019s running to replace Hill, told VICE News of Papadopoulos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that he would pick a district nowhere near affiliated where he lives, where there\u2019s an opening, \u201d she added, \u201cand try to make a name for himself,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd probably raise some money.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos joins a crowded Republican field. Among his challengers are Mark Cripe, a deputy sheriff from Los Angeles County; U.S. Navy veteran Mike Garcia; and Angela Underwood-Jacobs, a city council member from Lancaster.\n\nAll of these candidates are running with no end date in sight: Gov. Newsom, a Democrat, has two weeks to call a date for the special election, but that clock doesn\u2019t start ticking until Hill officially vacates her seat.\n\nSmith, whose campaign says she raised $100,000 in the day after announcing her bid for Congress, won her seat in the lower house of California\u2019s legislative branch only last year. But she\u2019s already scooped up a pile of endorsements from unions and Democratic lawmakers across Southern California, including the majority of the state party\u2019s delegates.\n\nComplicating matters, Smith is also a friend of Hill\u2019s \u2014 and on Monday, less than 24 hours after Hill resigned, Smith was the first Democrat to announce she would run to replace her. But she tells VICE News that she didn\u2019t initially plan on running, saying only that she \u201cwas in contact with [Hill] as a friend\u201d to make sure she was OKokay in the days following the publication of her nude photos.\n\nIn a district where Hill cruised to victory in part because of her working-class background and local ties, Smith is banking on that history to help edge out Republicans. She spent 10 years working as a school board member in the Santa Clarita Valley.\n\nAlso like Hill, Smith has embraced the ideology behind a number of progressive legislative efforts \u2014 like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal \u2014 without quite committing to cosponsoring either of those bills in Congress.\n\nSmith tells VICE News she supports a public healthcare option and will \u201crefine\u201d her position on healthcare in the coming weeks, but will largely look to the eventual Democratic nominee for president to define their vision first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really made an effort to reach out across the aisle,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe do still have a truly and uniquely purple district.\u201d\n\nCover: Katie Hill, at The Wrap's Power Women's Summit_Inside at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, California on November 2, 2018.
