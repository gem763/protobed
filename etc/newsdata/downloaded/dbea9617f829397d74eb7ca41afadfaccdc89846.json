Nasdaq-100 futures rose 15.25 points, or 0.2%, to 7,873.\n\nStocks rose Friday, capping a positive week for major indexes as trade-war jitters moved to the back burner after Beijing and Washington affirmed plans for renewed talks next month. The Dow saw a 1.5% weekly rise, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.8%. The Nasdaq Composite posted a 1.8% weekly advance.\n\nLast week's gains left the S&P 500 1.6% below its all-time closing high of 3,025.86 set on July 26, while the Dow ended Friday off 2.1% from its record close of 27,359.16 set on July 15. The Nasdaq ended last week off 2.7% from its all-time closing high of 8,330.21 set on July 26.\n\n\"In the broader market, risk appetite has returned on Monday, with Asian stock markets being a sea of green, despite some disappointing trade data out of China over the weekend,\" wrote market analysts at XM, in a note. \"Even though exports for August were weaker than expected, Chinese authorities were quick to calm markets by hinting at more monetary stimulus to cushion the tariff-hit economy.\"\n\nData showed China's global exports fell 3% (link) to $214.8 billion in August, while imports rose 1.7% to $180 billion.\n\nGerman exports unexpectedly rose in July (link), offering a rare bright spot following a run of downbeat economic data out of Europe's largest economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Central Bank is widely expected to deliver a further rate cut, pushing its deposit rate further into negative territory, when policy makers meet Thursday. The ECB may also move to restart a bond-buying program it ended in December as it responds to a slowing economy and stubbornly below-target inflation.\n\nFederal Reserve policy makers meet next week, with recent data, including last Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs report, seen underlining expectations it will move to cut its key lending rate.\n\nRead:Central bankers now know: Hang together or hang separately (link)\n\nOn the economic calendar, data on July consumer credit is due at 3 p.m. Eastern.
