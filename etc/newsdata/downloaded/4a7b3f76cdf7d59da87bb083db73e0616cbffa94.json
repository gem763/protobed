Asked whether Trump\u2019s invitation to the Chinese was unconstitutional, a senior administration official told RCP, \u201cNot sure why it would be.\u201d So, was the request calculated? He was exposing hypocrisy, a source close to the White House insisted.\n\n\u201cDemocrats and media have no shame coordinating fake attacks on Kavanaugh and Trump,\u201d the Republican source told RCP,\u201d yet suddenly they are aghast that the president ask for people to look into real corruption allegations against Biden.\u201d\u2026\n\nIf the Chinese find or create dirt from those business dealings, the next thing they could do is name their price. And while Kazianis noted that the most likely scenario is that the Chinese would stand down for fear of offending a future Democratic president, if the Chinese come to the trade-war bargaining table, they would be looking for a detente.\n\n\u201cI would not be shocked if they did come up with something, and it isn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility that Trump may reward them with an interim deal until the end of the election and maybe get more aggressive afterward,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s put it this way, if I was Joe Biden\u2019s son, I\u2019d be a little worried.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Philip Wegmann", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
