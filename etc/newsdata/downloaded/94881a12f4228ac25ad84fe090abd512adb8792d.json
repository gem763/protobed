After all, do you know what\u2019s not terrible? Freedom. But unfortunately, folks at colleges and universities all across the country seem to be favoring extreme government intervention \u2014 intervention that would come, of course, at the expense of exactly those freedoms that anyone with a brain knows we should cherish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I\u2019m asking you to do your part \u2014 by donating to National Review. Just how in the doggone heck are the two connected, you might ask? Well, National Review gives me a platform to expose and ridicule all of the craziness that goes on on campuses every day. Like the Michigan State University student who values our freedom of speech so little that he apparently thought his roommate should not be allowed to watch a Ben Shapiro video. In fact, there are a lot of examples of both students and administrators on college campuses failing to recognize the value of this very important right. Like the president of Santa Monica College, who instructed students to report \u201chate speech\u201d to the police. Or the administrators at Middlebury College, who apologized to students who were upset that a conservative speaker had been invited, and promised that they would do their best to prevent that from ever happening again. Or the members of a student group at California State University, Chico, who were concerned about their safety because a campus Republican group wanted to talk about gun policy.\n\nUnfortunately, instances that display a lack of understanding of \u2014 or even blatant distaste for \u2014 our sacred constitutional rights on this country\u2019s college campuses are far, far too numerous to list here. It\u2019s true: There\u2019s not just an example or two, or even a handful. There are a ton, which to me means that there\u2019s a real risk of a complete cultural shift, a shift away from freedom and reality and into government control and bananaland. That\u2019s why I\u2019m determined to do what the great William F. Buckley Jr. would do, and yell \u201cSTOP!\u201d \u2014 which is why I\u2019m so grateful to be able to do exactly that in my columns for National Review every week.\n\nIf you think that this issue is as important as I do, I\u2019d encourage you to donate to National Review. And if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s important? Well, in that case, I\u2019d say you should go hang out with some liberal college kids over in bananaland \u2014 and please never come to any of my parties.", "description": "Folks at colleges and universities all across the country seem to be favoring extreme government intervention\u00a0\u2014\u00a0intervention\u00a0that\u00a0would come, of course, at the expense of\u00a0exactly\u00a0those freedoms\u00a0that\u00a0anyone with a brain knows we should cherish.", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "Andrew C.
