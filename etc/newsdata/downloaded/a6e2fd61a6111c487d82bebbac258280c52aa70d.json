Among the guests was Sophia Williams-De Bruyn who in 1956 led 20,000 women to march on the Union Buildings in Pretoria in protest of apartheid pass laws.\n\nShe is the last living leader of the march, which she led at the age of 18. The Duchess described her an inspiration not only to herself but for all women.\n\nThe Duchess told the women: \u201cI was recently reminded that the first one up the mountain often gets knocked down the hardest, but makes way for everyone behind them. These brave women have been able to see how their struggle can pave the way for so many. For all young women organizers, activists and campaigners today, you must keep at it and know that you are working for this generation and the next, and also continuing the legacy of the generations of great women before you.\n\nMeghan at a breakfast meeting in Cape Town More\n\n\u201cWe can learn a certain amount from the outside, by tracking it through the news, but it\u2019s not the same as being able to truly understand what it\u2019s like on the ground. Much of my life I have been advocating for women and girls\u2019 rights, so this has been an incredibly powerful moment to hear first-hand from all of you.\n\n\u201cI have been so moved by what I have heard. The leadership and strength shown by these women is remarkable, and at a time when the issue of gender and gender-based violence is at the forefront of people\u2019s minds, I hope their voices will resonate and not only give comfort but also create change.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a South African issue, this is a global problem that can only find solution with the attention and work of everyone, regardless of gender, status, politics, race or nationality.\u201d\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex yesterday demonstrated her solidarity with millions of female victims of violence by posting a photograph of herself at the shrine to a teenage student raped and murdered in South Africa.\n\nThe Duchess promoted a new movement #AmINext that has sprung up following the brutal killing of Uyinene Mrwetyana.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex with Sophia Williams-De Bruyn More", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex hosted a breakfast meeting with a group of South African women leaders at the high commission in Cape Town during her and the Duke's tour of the continent.
