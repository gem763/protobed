There is no assurance that all their honest, hard-earned, tax-paid money will be recoverable at some point. There is understandable anger at the fraud and gross regulatory oversight whereby over 21,000 fake accounts were created over the years, to give over 70% of its loans to just one group, HDIL.\n\nBetter regulation of cooperative banks is being talked about now.

It speaks to the tragically inadequate pace of reforms overall.", "description": "\u201cIt seems brutally unfair that we have allowed a system of loan waivers and write-offs every now and again, but do not have robust enough financial systems to protect the honest, common man\u2019s savings.\u201d In...", "authors": ["Quick Edit"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/100x100-Quick-Edit-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
