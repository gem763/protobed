That was a quick wash/dress/walk over #Corrie.\"\n\nAnother jibbed: \"Daniel got ready quick blimey.\"\n\nThinking the same, another quizzed: \"right so did Daniel just teleport into the room?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nOthers typed: \"F**king hell, does everyone own a Tardis suddenly!\" and \"Bloody hell. Daniel got washed, changed and refreshed literally in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nA micro-blogger contributed: \"Wow, Daniel got over there quick! Did he jaunt?\"\n\nIn Thursday's episode of Coronation Streer, Sinead woke up and initially had no recollection of her blazing row with Daniel that was aired on Wednesday's instalment.\n\nShe then remembered what happened, but is determined to forget about her husband and went on to film some home videos for her son Bertie to remember her by.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nSinead wanted to make sure Bertie realised how much she loved him, knowing that she will miss his first birthday, his first day at school and his wedding day.\n\nElsewhere, the Barlows were frantic with worry when Daniel failed to return home.\n\nDastardly Daniel passed out by the canal after downing a bottle of vodka.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAfter gazing at Bertie's dummy, which had 'mummy's boy' written on, Daniel went for another swig of booze.\n\nBut he passed out and the bottle fell out of his hand and rolled away to the edge of the water.\n\nThis came after Sinead discovered Bethany Platt's notebook and came to a shocking realisation.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nRead More Next week's soap spoilers EastEnders\n\nEmmerdale\n\nCorrie\n\nHollyoaks\n\nShe asked Daniel what was going on with Bethany, but he struggled to give a straight answer and dug himself a bigger hole.\n\nDaniel eventually confessed that he had kissed Bethany - leaving Sinead to throw him out.\n\n*Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays on ITV at 7.30pm and 8.30pm", "description": "The tragic scenes - that brought a tear to viewers' eyes - were 'ruined' for some fans because of Sinead's husband Daniel appearing to 'teleport'", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20719458.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Coronation-Street-Sinead-and-Daniel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
