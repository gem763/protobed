Becerra\u2019s draft regulations proposed specific requirements for compliance with the law, such as the \u201cDo Not Sell\u201d link.\n\nBusinesses must also treat choices expressed in user-enabled privacy settings as a valid opt-out request under the law and provide a \u201creasonable method\u201d for verifying identity when people request to delete their data, according to the proposals.\n\nLoyalty program incentives should be \u201creasonably related\u201d to the value of a consumer\u2019s data to the business, calculated according to eight methods outlined in the regulations, or risk falling foul of non-discrimination provisions.\n\nCompanies that handle the personal information of more than 4 million consumers will be subject to additional requirements.\n\nAccording to an estimate provided by the attorney general\u2019s office, the regulations will protect over $12 billion worth of personal information used for advertising each year.
