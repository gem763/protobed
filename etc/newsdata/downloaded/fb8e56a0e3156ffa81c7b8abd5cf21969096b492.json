Intel Corp <INTC.O>, Nvidia Corp <NVDA.O> and Advanced Micro Devices Inc <AMD.O> all rose about 1.5%, while Apple Inc <AAPL.O> gained 1.3%.\n\nWedbush hiked its price target for shares of the iPhone maker, as the brokerage remained bullish on the official launch of the company's Apple TV+ video streaming service.\n\nOther gainers included oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp <XOM.N> and Chevron Corp <CVX.N>, which rose 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively as a report of an attack on an Iranian oil tanker lifted oil prices.
