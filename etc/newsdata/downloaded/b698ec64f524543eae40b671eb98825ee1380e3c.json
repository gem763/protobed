Didn\u2019t.\n\nIan Waite, 48, who quit the BBC dance competition in 2009, was paired with Zoe in 2005 when they made the final of the series.\n\nAnd on last night\u2019s show it all started when Zoe suggested that Ian looked \u2018 a bit like Johnny from Dirty Dancing\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018It\u2019s a strong look. He\u2019s going to lift me up in a minute. It\u2019s going to be amazing.\u2019\n\nTo which the 48-year-old replied bluntly: \u2018I\u2019m not that strong.\u2019\n\nThe dancer\u2019s comment quickly drew a reaction from the camera crews as they gasped.\n\nIan felt a little sheepish after he made the comment\n\n(Picture: BBC)\n\nViewers of the show also took to Twitter to vent their anger.\n\nOne tweeted: \u2018 Somewhere, Ian\u2019s furious partner is cancelling their romantic dinner tonight #ittakestwo\u2018\n\nAnother commented: \u2018SIT DOWN IAN\u2019\n\nOne added: \u2018I can\u2019t believe Ian just said that.\u2019\n\nAlthough the TV host took the comment on the chin as she replied: \u2018He\u2019s got a point, I am 12 stone. I\u2019m OK with that.\u2019\n\nLooking guilty, Ian added quietly: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019\n\nZoe didn\u2019t seem to mind, telling viewers: \u2018We have tried.\u2019\n\nLuckily for Ian, Zoe took the comment on the chin.\n\n(Picture: BBC)\n\nIan was on the show to give his expert view on the celebrity dancers in It Takes Two\u2019s semi-regular feature Waite\u2019s Warm Up.\n\nHowever, after making that kind of joke about the host \u2013 he might not be invited back on the show.\n\nZoe and Ian came third on Strictly Come Dancing in the 2005 series, scoring an impressive 38 out of 40 points in two different dances.\n\nIn 2011, she took over from Claudia Winkleman as the host of spin-off show It Takes Two.\n\nStrictly: It Takes Two airs tonight at 6pm on BBC Two.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
