But all we have to go by are alleged victims who also were drinking at the time, and comments from former classmates \u2014 who may also have been inebriated \u2014 some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez\u2019s story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez\u2019s mother, to whom she apparently said, \u201cSomething happened at Yale.\u201d\n\nNot exactly a wrap for justice.\n\nThe truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez\u2019s story was first reported by the New Yorker just days before Ford\u2019s congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser , not only doesn\u2019t remember the party but says she\u2019s never even met Kavanaugh.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kathleen Parker", "Msn.Com En-Us News Opinion Opinions-The-New-York-Timess-Travesty-Of-Journalistic-Ethics Ar-Aahrknq"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
