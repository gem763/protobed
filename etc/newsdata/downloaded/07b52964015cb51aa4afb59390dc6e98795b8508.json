But he has something to prove. We know he does.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of businessmen here and I think most of them will tell me to fight him because it\u2019ll bring money. I'd fight all the main contenders first, and I could fight him to benefit my agricultural projects.\n\n\u201cI have to say that Tony Ferguson deserves it more. You have to give him credit. He is on a 12-fight win streak and he deserves it more than Conor.\n\n(Image: X02835)\n\n\"Conor should come back, win, earn his place and get in line.\u201d\n\nNurmagomedov added: \u201cI\u2019m not ready to shake his hand right now.\n\n\u201cWhen a person continues to behave this way, it means that it\u2019s his nature. So I\u2019m not ready to shake his hand until he realizes something.\n\n\u201cIf a person apologizes and accepts his mistakes, we have to excuse him.\u201d\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, Gaethje says he has tried \"every route there is\" to set up a clash with McGregor, telling the Irishman he \"either needs to go away or fight\".\n\nGaethje said: \"I wrote him a message like f**king seven months ago just trying to be his friend.\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried every route. I\u2019m trying reverse psychology. I\u2019m trying to be his friend.\n\n\"I\u2019m trying every f**king route that there is to draw this man out. And I can't draw him out.\"", "description": "Russian did not rule out McGregor clash, but said he'll have to get in the back of the queue as rivalry 'is a thing of the past'", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18791642.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_UFC-229-Khabib-v-McGregor-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
