For more than a decade now, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time online, searching and surfing and sometimes adding to the great databases of the Internet. The Web has been a godsend to me as a writer. Research that once required days in the stacks or periodical rooms of libraries can now be done in minutes. A few Google searches, some quick clicks on hyperlinks, and I\u2019ve got the telltale fact or pithy quote I was after. Even when I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m as likely as not to be foraging in the Web\u2019s info-thickets\u2019reading and writing e-mails, scanning headlines and blog posts, watching videos and listening to podcasts, or just tripping from link to link to link. (Unlike footnotes, to which they\u2019re sometimes likened, hyperlinks don\u2019t merely point to related works; they propel you toward them.)\n\nFor me, as for others, the Net is becoming a universal medium, the conduit for most of the information that flows through my eyes and ears and into my mind. The advantages of having immediate access to such an incredibly rich store of information are many, and they\u2019ve been widely described and duly applauded. \u201cThe perfect recall of silicon memory,\u201d Wired\u2019s Clive Thompson has written, \u201ccan be an enormous boon to thinking.\u201d But that boon comes at a price. As the media theorist Marshall McLuhan pointed out in the 1960s, media are not just passive channels of information. They supply the stuff of thought, but they also shape the process of thought. And what the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to take in information the way the Net distributes it: in a swiftly moving stream of particles. Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one. When I mention my troubles with reading to friends and acquaintances\u2014literary types, most of them\u2014many say they\u2019re having similar experiences. The more they use the Web, the more they have to fight to stay focused on long pieces of writing. Some of the bloggers I follow have also begun mentioning the phenomenon. Scott Karp, who writes a blog about online media, recently confessed that he has stopped reading books altogether. \u201cI was a lit major in college, and used to be [a] voracious book reader,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He speculates on the answer: \u201cWhat if I do all my reading on the web not so much because the way I read has changed, i.e. I\u2019m just seeking convenience, but because the way I THINK has changed?\u201d\n\nBruce Friedman, who blogs regularly about the use of computers in medicine, also has described how the Internet has altered his mental habits. \u201cI now have almost totally lost the ability to read and absorb a longish article on the web or in print,\u201d he wrote earlier this year. A pathologist who has long been on the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, Friedman elaborated on his comment in a telephone conversation with me. His thinking, he said, has taken on a \u201cstaccato\u201d quality, reflecting the way he quickly scans short passages of text from many sources online. \u201cI can\u2019t read War and Peace anymore,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the ability to do that. Even a blog post of more than three or four paragraphs is too much to absorb. I skim it.\u201d", "description": "What the Internet is doing to our brains", "authors": ["Nicholas Carr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2017/10/0708_WEL_Carr_Mach01-1/facebook.jpg?1522841523"}
