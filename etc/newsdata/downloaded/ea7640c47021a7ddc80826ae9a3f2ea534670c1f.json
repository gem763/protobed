As the fighters step over the body of a dead man in civilian clothing to reach inside the vehicle, a female voice is briefly heard coming from the back seat.\n\n\u201cAnother fleeing pig has been liquidated by the hands of the National Army. He was fleeing in an armored car,\u201d says one of the fighters as the others clamor to be filmed\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened next is unclear, but the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the woman in the car was Kurdish politician, Hevrin Khalaf, whose body was found later in the day in a nearby morgue. Khalaf was the secretary general of a newly established party, the Future Party of Syria.\n\nAD\n\nA Turkish newspaper, Yeni Safak, trumpeted her killing as a \u201csuccessful operation\u201d against a politician affiliated with the \u201cterrorist\u201d People\u2019s Democratic Union, the Kurdish political party that runs northeast Syria.\n\nThe newspaper said she had been \u201cneutralized\u201d in the operation, and described her death as a big setback for the group.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, a total of nine civilians were executed on Saturday at the roadblock to the south of the town of Tal Abyad. Several other photos and videos posted by the Ahrar al-Sharqiya rebel group, which was apparently among those involved in manning the roadblock, show captured men surrounded by fighters on the side of the road.\n\nAD\n\nAhrar al-Sharqiyeh is composed of fighters mostly from the eastern province of Deir al-Zour, much of which is currently controlled by the SDF.\n\nAD\n\nThe Syrian National Army, an umbrella group uniting a number of Syrian rebel factions, condemned the killing in a statement and said it had launched an investigation into what it said represented a violation of \u201cthe standards and values that we commit to.\u201d\n\nThe videoed killing and others that may have occurred off camera almost certainly constitute a war crime, according to international law, and may breach one of the conditions Trump set for allowing the Turkish offensive to go ahead unhindered by U.S. troops in the area. In a tweet last week he cautioned the Turks not to undertake any \u201cunforced or unnecessary fighting\u201d or else they would face measures against their economy and currency.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey views the Syrian Kurdish forces, which were key U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State, as a terrorist group on its doorstep and a threat to its national security.\n\nAD", "description": "Turkish-backed Syrian rebels may have shot as many as nine people at a desert roadblock, including a female politician.", "authors": ["Liz Sly", "Beirut Bureau Chief", "Covering Lebanon", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Og7WI_XNz-OFM07c_KsDu5p53uc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VAZJO5HNUQI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
