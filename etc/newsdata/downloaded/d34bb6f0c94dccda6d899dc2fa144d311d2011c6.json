They get on and share a love of music too. I know he invited her to a preview of an exhibition at the palace.\n\n\u201cThe Queen has been a source of strength too and invited them both to Balmoral where family problems are usually aired.\u201d\n\nWhatever the truth of these overtures to Meghan, it appears that the film was made without consultation with senior courtiers, the queen, Charles or Prince William.\n\nIn the documentary, Harry spoke about the need for \u201cmanagement,\u201d of his own mental health problems, and implied that he was struggling in this regard, saying, \u201cI thought I was out of the woods and suddenly it all came back.\u201d\n\nHarry has previously spoken about how his life descended into \u201cchaos\u201d as a result, he believes, of failing to properly process the death of his mother.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out for comment to the offices of William and Harry, Kate and William and the Queen but all have so far declined to comment on the extraordinarily candid film, which screened Sunday evening in the U.K. and is due to go out on Wednesday in the US.\n\nThe film, made by Harry\u2019s old friend, the journalist Tom Bradby, followed the Sussexes on their tour of southern Africa earlier this month.\n\nIn candid interviews, the couple both said they were struggling with intense scrutiny from the British tabloid press.\n\nIn addition to saying he had \u201cbad days\u201d with his brother, Harry also said that the flashes of cameras caused him to flashback to the worst moments of his mother\u2019s life and said his own mental health had suffered a setback of late, while Meghan revealed that her friends had warned her not to marry her husband, whom she calls \u201cH\u201d, because tabloids would \u201cdestroy\u201d her life.\n\nShe fought back tears as she confirmed she was \u201cnot doing OK,\u201d and said that those who envied her life of wealth and fame had \u201cno idea\u201d and were simply falling into the trap of thinking the \u201cgrass is greener.\u201d\n\nIt has been a long time, of course, since a senior royal has gone rogue in such spectacular fashion and today there was much discussion about how the palace might seek to reign in Meghan and Harry.\n\nThe suggestion that the couple\u2019s mental state might be \u201cfragile\u201d will feed into speculation that a widely reported but unconfirmed six-week break from royal duties is as much an enforced mental health break for Harry and Meghan as anything else.\n\n\u201c He can\u2019t bear the media...he hates us...As he walks past us he will scowl at us... he will turn shoulder away from the cameras to deny them a shot... he just can\u2019t bear the sight of us, it is painfully obvious \u201d\n\nIt is also feeding debate on what life Harry and Meghan want\u2014one within the royal family, or one detached from it.\n\nHarry\u2019s furious diatribe against the media prompted a fascinating response from the BBC\u2019s royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, who accused Harry in a podcast broadcast a few weeks ago of \u201csanctimony\u201d and said, \u201cHe can\u2019t bear the media...he hates us...As he walks past us he will scowl at us... he will turn shoulder away from the cameras to deny them a shot... he just can\u2019t bear the sight of us, it is painfully obvious.\u201d\n\nHowever there was more sympathy from other quarters with some observers saying the palace risked repeating with Meghan the mistakes made in abandoning and not supporting Diana.\n\nThe writer Christopher Andersen, author of the best selling biography of William and Harry, Diana\u2019s Boys, told The Daily Beast: \u201cIt was really such a poignant and totally revealing moment when Meghan told her interviewer, \u201cNot many people ask if I\u2019m OK.\u201d It is precisely the same cry for help we heard from Diana time and time and time again.\n\n\u201cThe obvious intrusions from the press are one thing, but Diana also complained bitterly about the demands from the Palace, the lack of any praise or positive feedback, the absence of empathy from the Royal Family and the infamous and largely anonymous \u201cMen in Gray\u201d who really run the monarchy.\n\n\u201cEven with the support of a loving husband\u2014which Diana never had\u2014Meghan is cracking, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me. She was a young, talented, independent American career woman suddenly thrust into this position where she has to really toe the royal line.\n\n\u201c Her privacy is gone. Her ability to control her own life is gone. This, in turn, is having a devastating impact on the man who loves her but really is fairly powerless to do anything about their predicament \u201d\n\n\u201cHer privacy is gone. Her ability to control her own life is gone. This, in turn, is having a devastating impact on the man who loves her but really is fairly powerless to do anything about their predicament.\n\n\u201cNow add to the marriage post-traumatic stress disorder regarding the paparazzi\u2019s relentless pursuit of his mother, the flashbacks to her essentially being chased to her death in Paris. This is obviously putting enormous strain on the couple, and the one person Harry would logically turn to, William, is having none of it.\n\nAnderson's royal sources have told him that William feels he and Kate have coped with the same pressures if not more\u2014he is the heir, after all\u2014\u201cand that the Cambridges have no sympathy for Meghan\u2019s behind-the-scenes complaints. And certainly, when it comes to their mother\u2019s death, even to this day, William has his own demons to cope with.\n\n\u201cStill, this is all eerily reminiscent of the young Diana desperately reaching out for a little moral support, for a few words of praise, and getting nothing back.\u201d", "description": "After Harry and Meghan\u2019s bombshell documentary, Prince William is said to be worried about his brother, and sources claim Prince Charles and the queen have reached out to Meghan.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571683355/191021-sykes-meghan-harry-tease_lei1ca", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
