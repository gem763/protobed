In the US, teenagers spend an average of nine hours a day looking at screens, according to Pew Research.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that kids younger than 18 months old spend no time in front of screens, that those between two and five should get just an hour a day - ideally alongside adults.\n\nFor teenagers, the US doesn't have explicit guidelines.\n\nEngland has no screen time guidelines, but in Canada less than two hours a day is recommended.\n\nAn additional hour per day of TV was linked to a 32 percent higher risk of exceeding World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations for sugar.\n\nChildren between two and 18 should eat fewer than six teaspoons of added sugar per day. That's about 25 grams of sugar or 100 calories.\n\nEach hour more per day of TV was also linked to a 28 percent increased risk of exceeding WHO caffeine recommendations.\n\nThese state adolescents aged 12 to 18 should cap daily caffeine intake at 100 mg - the equivalent of about one cup of coffee or two cups of tea.\n\nThe study published in PLOS ONE found 27 and 21 percent of the participants exceeded the recommended consumption of sugar and caffeine, respectively.\n\nBoys got through more fizzy drinks than girls - and 13 year olds had more than 15 year olds.\n\nA recent worldwide study of almost 250,000 people, mainly children, blamed fizzy drinks for fueling the obesity epidemic.\n\nIt reviewed data from 30 surveys and found almost all linked piling on the pounds to the 'empty calories' in the beverages.\n\nIn the UK, one in three children are overweight by the time they leave primary school, and a fifth obese.\n\nUnhealthy eating and drinking has been found to be linked to adults watching TV alone, Dr Morrison pointed out.\n\nThe researchers were surprised to find video game use was only weakly linked to more caffeine consumption.\n\nAdded Dr Morrison: 'Given the marketing campaigns that target video gamers, we expected a particularly strong association between caffeine intake from energy drinks or sodas with video game use, but TV was linked more strongly.'\n\nBut using a computer for school was linked to a lower likelihood of exceeding sugar consumption cut offs.", "description": "A new McMaster University and California State University - Fullerton study found that three hours of TV and each hour of social media and screen time raises the risks kids will drink too much soda.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/19/20046478-0-image-a-3_1571767807357.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
