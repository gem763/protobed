One television network even used a helicopter to film a vehicle that reportedly had Leonard inside after he flew to Toronto to meet with the Raptors.\n\nRivers knows Canadian fans will be looking forward to seeing Leonard live on Thursday.\n\n\"They should be excited,\" the coach said. \"He did something very special for this country. So that'll be a lot of fun for him, for sure.\"\n\nLeonard is returning to the city where he took part in his first and only training camp with the Raptors last year.", "description": "Former Toronto Raptors star Kawhi Leonard will be back on a Canadian court tonight when his Los Angeles Clippers face the Dallas Mavericks in Vancouver.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5324900.1571338805!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bkn-clippers-basketball-20191017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
