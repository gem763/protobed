Every conversation we have is based on the long-term.\u2019\n\nOne of the main criticisms of the Glazers is the debt saddled on United by their leveraged \u00a3780m buyout which currently stands at \u00a3511m.\n\nFans protest against the Glazers outside Old Trafford before the Liverpool game on Sunday\n\nThe Americans have been unpopular among many fans since acquiring United in 2005\n\nBut in an interview with fanzine United We Stand, Woodward played down that figure, saying: \u2018The debt is a long-term, structured and similar to some other football clubs.\n\n\u2018It's a fixed amount for a fixed period of time which results in it being fairly cheap to service.\n\n\u2018It's just under two per cent our annual revenue each year, so it doesn't really have any impact on us.\u2019", "description": "The Americans have been unpopular among many fans since acquiring United in 2005, and are coming under renewed attack following the club's poor start to the season", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/15/19957798-0-image-a-3_1571581356931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
