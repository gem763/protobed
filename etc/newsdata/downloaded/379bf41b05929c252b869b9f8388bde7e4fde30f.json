I know where I can get to. So it\u2019s just keeping my head down and working, and then being able to show that whenever I get the opportunity.\u201d\n\nLynch's fall from potential franchise savior to practice-squad (and then third-string) quarterback has been remarkably swift, in part because of his unusually brief tenure in Denver.\n\nThe Broncos cut the Memphis product last fall, prior to his third season, after he failed to beat out Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler and Case Keenum at various points over parts of two years. He threw for 792 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions in just five regular-season appearances in Denver; Since at least 2000, no first-round quarterback has played in fewer games before being cut by the team that drafted him.\n\n\"I would\u2019ve obviously liked to have had more opportunities to play (in Denver),\" Lynch said. \"I feel like that's good for everybody. Any young player, to develop, I feel like you\u2019ve got to play those guys. ... But it just didn\u2019t go that way.\"\n\nAfter being released last September, Lynch had workouts with 10 different NFL teams but didn't latch on with a team until January, when the Seattle Seahawks signed him to a future contract. He competed for the chance to back up Russell Wilson before suffering a concussion in the preseason and ultimately losing that battle to Geno Smith.\n\nThat's where the Steelers came in.\n\nOffensive coordinator Randy Fichtner was on hand for Lynch's pro day in 2016 and came away impressed with his arm strength and potential. So when Roethlisberger underwent elbow surgery, and Lynch was available, the Steelers moved to take advantage of what Fichtner called \"a unique opportunity\" to see what the lanky quarterback could offer.\n\n\"Sometimes when you get drafted in the first round, there\u2019s a certain expectation that gets put on top of you \u2014 that we\u2019re going to roll the ball out and you\u2019re going to be a franchise quarterback,\" Fichtner said. \"That may not happen overnight. It may not happen in your first contract. That doesn\u2019t mean that it might not happen for you, if you keep your nose to the grind and you eventually hook on in that right fit, with that right team style, that right staff, that right system. You just never know.\"\n\nNow, Lynch is working to pick up what is his fourth offensive system in four years. The Steelers actually gave him some first-team repetitions during their recent bye week in an effort to evaluate him, and gauge his understanding of the system.\n\nIn a weird way, Fichtner said, Lynch has become the grizzled veteran in a room that, without Roethlisberger, consists of second-year quarterback Mason Rudolph and undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges.\n\n\"I wonder what happened (in Denver) sometimes, but your past has nothing to do with your future,\" added Steelers practice-squad receiver Tevin Jones, who played with Lynch at Memphis.\n\n\"The only thing I do know is that he\u2019s a lot better now than he was before, from what I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m just glad that he\u2019s here.\"\n\nAnd so is Lynch.\n\nThough he never could have predicted that he would be here in Pittsburgh, on his third NFL team in four years, he said he is staying positive.\n\n\"Obviously my plan is not the plan that God has for my life right now,\" Lynch said. \"If I would\u2019ve planned it out, I wish I would\u2019ve been starting in Denver or still in Denver. But I\u2019m not, so my journey is where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m supposed to be where I\u2019m at right now.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "description": "Paxton Lynch went from the Broncos' QB of the future to out of the NFL in 2018.
