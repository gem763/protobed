In avoiding the daily minutiae of Capitol Hill, \u201cMid-Day News\u201d stood out\u2014eschewing the gimmicks and guest stars that have come to dominate SNL\u2019s takes on the topic.\n\nThe segment also succeeded in its pacing, as the absurd competition steadily descended into chaos. The foursome grew more and more enthusiastic with each story: Nwodim and Thompson\u2019s high fives became full-on celebrations, while Waller-Bridge\u2019s and Moffat\u2019s initial reluctance gave way to obsessive excitement. (In one of the funniest punch lines, both Nwodim\u2019s and Moffat\u2019s characters united in passing over a headline about a Latino man. \u201cSkip that one; we don\u2019t need that,\u201d Nwodim said, dismissively waving the story away.) By the end of the sketch, Chris Redd\u2019s meteorologist, who\u2019d been keeping score, had loosened his tie and looked frazzled, as if he\u2019d been reacting to the match offscreen the entire time.\n\nWhile watching \u201cMid-Day News,\u201d I was reminded of Key & Peele\u2019s \u201cBlack Ice,\u201d a similarly sharp and chaotic sketch in which a newscast\u2019s black meteorologists (played by the stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) squared off against the white anchors\u2019 not-so-subtly racist descriptions of \u201cblack ice,\u201d a homophone for black guys. The comedy there came from Key\u2019s and Peele\u2019s obvious consternation at being unable to call their white colleagues out.\n\n\u201cMid-Day News,\u201d however, mined its humor from having the ensemble collectively engage in\u2014and subsequently lose their minds over\u2014the racial stereotypes that influence their perceptions of one another. After \u201cwinning,\u201d Thompson\u2019s character turned to shake the hand of Waller-Bridge\u2019s. \u201cGood game,\u201d he said. \u201cGood game.\u201d Such a wholesome final shot illustrating sportsmanship makes for a sweet, if idealistic, capper. Outside of Studio 8H, it seems implausible for a \u201cgame\u201d like this to end with a handshake.\n\n\n\nStill, \u201cMid-Day News\u201d successfully explored an uncomfortable truth: Everyone harbors assumptions about race\u2014and when it comes to the news, it\u2019s important to read past the headline. Perhaps that\u2019s an obvious reminder, but in real life, it\u2019s an embarrassing one to admit. On SNL, however, it\u2019s the perfect fodder for a standout sketch.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
