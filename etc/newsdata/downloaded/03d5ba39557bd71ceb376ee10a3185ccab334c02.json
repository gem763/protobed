The 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 3.30%, falling 1 basis point.\n\nMortgage rates roughly track the direction of the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.18% . The yield on the 10-year note has generally fallen since mid-August, though this week it began to show signs of a rebound amid growing optimism sparked by planned trade talks between the U.S. and China.\n\n\u201cMortgage rates continued the summer swoon due to weaker economic data,\u201d Freddie Mac wrote. \u201cWhile economic growth is clearly slowing due to rising manufacturing and trade headwinds, economic fundamentals are still solid for U.S. consumers.\u201d\n\n\u2018Mortgage rates continued the summer swoon due to weaker economic data. While economic growth is clearly slowing due to rising manufacturing and trade headwinds, economic fundamentals are still solid for U.S. consumers.\u2019 Freddie Mac\n\nThe Federal Reserve released its latest edition of the Beige Book, its periodic commentary on the state of the economy, on Wednesday. Although the Fed\u2019s language painted a fairly rosy picture of the economy, most downside risks persist. As a result, many analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when it meets later this month.\n\n\u201cIf there were some sense among Fed staffers that the rate cut should be postponed, they certainly did not establish a defense of that position in this Beige Book,\u201d Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons, Jefferies\u2019 chief financial economist and senior money market economist, wrote in a research note Wednesday.\n\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard has gone further than some of his other colleagues, arguing that a 50-basis-point trimming may be what\u2019s needed to keep the Fed ahead of the curve on international trade\u2019s effect on the U.S. economy.\n\nMoves by the Fed don\u2019t directly trigger moves in the mortgage markets, since the Fed manipulates short-term interest rates and not long-term rates like those on mortgages.\n\nHowever, the Fed\u2019s signals are typically baked into mortgage rates in advance of an expected cut to short-term rates. Therefore, people looking to take out a new home loan can reasonably expect mortgage rates to move downward in the coming weeks as long as the Fed is expected to cut rates.", "description": "Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates again later this month.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH997_neighb_ZG_20190422082721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
