The average rental return on Sydney units is 3.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent for houses.\n\nRental return, or yield, is calculated by dividing total rental income for the year by the price of the property. The number indicates how much rental income covers the costs of the property itself.\n\nSydney returns remain low because property prices are the highest in the country and rents have been dropping over the past year, housing experts said.\n\nBuyer\u2019s agent Simon Taylor said rental returns were particularly important in the current climate of strict lending for investment purposes.\n\nInvestors, unlike first home buyers and other owner occupier buyers, have not benefited from recent interest rate cuts and relaxed lending standards and are still finding it difficult to secure loans, Mr Taylor said.\n\nBanks were often more accommodating if the property attracted a high rental return and was located in an area where vacancies were rare because it meant the landlord would spend less servicing their mortgage, he said.\n\nProperties where the rents covered most, if not all, of the mortgage were much more common in some parts of regional Australia, according to CoreLogic.\n\nA typical unit in Cairns, for example, had a yield of 7.3 per cent, which meant the average landlord could pay off their mortgage with their rental income each month and still have some money left over.\n\nAverage returns in regional NSW hubs Parkes and Muswellbrook were 6.3 per cent.\n\nLandlords in Woollahra, meanwhile, got an average rental return of 1.9 per cent \u2014 the lowest in the country. These landlords could not rely on rents to cover most of their mortgage repayments and would need to sink in considerable amounts of money each month on top of the rents collected to pay off their debt.\n\nPatrick Leo real estate adviser James Nihill said regional locations were presenting a more compelling case for property investment.\n\n\u201cRegional towns are often bolstered by major government infrastructure projects which strengthen their local economy, driving robust employment and population growth,\u201d Mr Nihill said.\n\nThis was not just evident when comparing Sydney to the regions, when looking at Melbourne as well, he said. \u201cHigh rental yields, which are double those on offer from the average Melbourne house, are prominent in the suburbs of Moe, Stawell, Shepparton, Ballarat and Bendigo,\u201d Mr Nihill said.\n\nA median-priced three-bedroom house in these suburbs was returning yields above 6 per cent, compared to a median rental yield for a house in greater Melbourne at 2.9 per cent, he said.", "description": "Investors seeking properties with high rental returns will find good opportunities in Sydney\u2019s west and southwest, but they will find even better returns in a prominent market outside the city.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20084110/capi_50646fd5a2e22b9a2512fcad9fd3c129_985dae7df58f3e29b84713e6727ebabc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
