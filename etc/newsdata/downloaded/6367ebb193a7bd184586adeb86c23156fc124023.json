I also don\u2019t think we are going to push this all the way to potentially breaking the cycle. I think this is much more about [presidential] posturing and taking a hard line stance and getting ready for the 2020 campaign election season,\u201d explained PNC Financial Services Chief Investment Strategist Amanda Agati on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\nAgati added, \u201cMy concern is really that if we continue to cut, and cut and cut rates and then we get a reprieve on the trade front, then perhaps we have wasted precious ammo that we might not have at our disposal when the time really comes \u2014 when the cycle rolls over and we really do need to pull additional levers.\u201d\n\nTo that point, count September 18, 2019 as a day when the Fed potentially wasted a bullet in its recession fighting arsenal.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates again by 25 basis points to a new target range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday. It marks the second \u201cinsurance rate cut\u201d by the Fed this year, and comes on the heels of slowdowns in U.S. manufacturing and the job market in large part from effects of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nRecession risk are rising\n\nDuring a press conference with reporters, Fed chief Jerome Powell promised the FOMC would stay data dependent with respect to future monetary policy actions. But by and large, Mr. Market took Powell\u2019s performance as a bit more dovish than planned.\n\nFederal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019, in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) More\n\n\u201cAlongside the willingness to \u201cact as appropriate,\u201d we see the bar for further insurance in the form of interest rate reductions as relatively low,\u201d Barclays strategist Michael Gapen said in a note to clients.\n\nWith that wink to markets of more rate cuts likely this fall, Powell may be poised to waste additional recession fighting bullets. And that garden variety recession appears to only be moving closer, according to a growing number of pros on Wall Street.\n\nCredit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub recently said in client research that recession risks are rising. Meanwhile, 38% of investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch expect a recession over the next year versus 59% who see a recession as unlikely. That\u2019s the highest net recession risk since August 2009.\n\nAt the Fed\u2019s current cutting pace, rates could be zero by mid-2020. By then, Trump may have wished he didn\u2019t clamor for lower rates, the economy could be barely growing and the Fed will have its hands tied. Try talking about that one at a campaign rally.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
