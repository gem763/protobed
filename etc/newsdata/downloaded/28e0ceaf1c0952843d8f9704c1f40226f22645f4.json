Photo: Courtesy of Plain English\n\nPlain English opened its New York showroom in 2018; the place, which features its bespoke cupboards and handsome millwork, somehow manages to evoke a dreamy world where families cook together before sitting down for a delicious home-cooked meal. Recently, when the company designers began considering whom it should enlist to help conceive new shades for its third paint collection, they immediately thought of interior designer (and a former editor at both Domino and T Magazine) Rita Konig. Konig, after all, not only has her own successful design business but also grew up in impeccable British homes designed by her mother, the iconic decorator Nina Campbell.

It also has large drawers and oversize antique brass drop handles. The Spitalfields cupboards are painted in \u201cNicotine,\u201d and the interiors are painted in \u201cSilver Polish.\u201d The walls are done in \u201cFlummery,\u201d a shade that Konig describes as a \u201cpale-lemon posset.\u201d Photo: Courtesy of Plain English\n\nThe Mendlesham Ball & Bar chair is painted in glossy \u201cMouldy Plum,\u201d which Konig says is \u201cthe perfect supporting-role color.\u201d Photo: Courtesy of Plain English\n\n\u201cThe premise of this collection,\u201d Konig says, \u201cis that you need three or four colors in a kitchen: for the island, the upper cabinets and lower cabinets, and for the stools, if you choose to have stools.\u201d The stools featured here are painted in \u201cRubbing Brick.\u201d \u201cDuring the creative process, we were always considering how various shades worked together,\u201d Konig adds. \u201cKate and I ultimately devised a palette that takes inspiration from historical interiors, natural fabrics, and British comestibles. It was funny: When we first met, we both brought packets of our inspirations \u2014 and quickly realized that they were virtually the same.\u201d Photo: Courtesy of Plain English", "description": "The British bespoke-kitchen-design company Plain English teamed up with interior designer Rita Konig to launch a paint collection (the company\u2019s third) meant specifically for the kitchen.
