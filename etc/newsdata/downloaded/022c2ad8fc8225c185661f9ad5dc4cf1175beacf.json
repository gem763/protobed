Metals are then purified and solidified before being turned into new products.\n\nHow the coin originally looked when the UK was destined to leave on March 29 this year (Picture: HM Treasury)\n\nThe cost of designing and producing the commemorative coins will be met by the Royal Mint out of its own revenues at no cost to the taxpayer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid had asked officials to look at whether it would be possible to produce the coins in volume ready for the UK\u2019s scheduled EU leaving date of October 31.\n\nNew mum draws eyebrows on newborn to teach her 'not to fall asleep at parties'\n\nFormer chancellor Philip Hammond had planned a limited edition of around 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for \u00a310 each.\n\nMr Javid revised the proposal for the coins to be produced for mass circulation. This was portrayed as a statement of intent that the Treasury was fully behind Brexit.\n\nThe coins will carry the words \u2018Friendship with all nations\u2019, but will be stamped with a new departure date \u2013 currently set to be January 31, 2020.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
