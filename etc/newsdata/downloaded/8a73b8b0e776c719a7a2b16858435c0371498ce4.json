When Reed began offseason workouts in south Florida in June \u2014 fully healthy, feeling great \u2014 he would call his trainer frantically in the hours after a session.\n\n\u201cEvery single day,\u201d said that trainer, Pete Bommarito, who works with several NFL players. \u201cHe\u2019d call that night and just say, \u2018How do I look? Am I back? Am I back ?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt is the question Reed\u2019s team, the Washington Redskins, spent much of this preseason asking, again: When will Jordan Reed be back?\n\nThe most optimistic take on the Washington season that begins Sunday in Philadelphia has to have Reed starting at tight end for \u2014 pick a number \u2014 12, 14 or (just imagine) 16 games. But the week leading up to that opener brought with it what have become eternal and inevitable questions about his availability. After the healthiest offseason he can remember, he was drilled in the head during Washington\u2019s third preseason game and hasn\u2019t played since. In an offense whose most promising playmakers are either unproven (Derrius Guice), aging (Adrian Peterson) or limited physically (everyone else?), Reed\u2019s ability to simply pull on pads and be some version of himself is essential.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an elite player,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said.\n\n\u201cHe changes our offense big-time,\u201d running back Chris Thompson said.\n\n[Trent Williams is in town, but Adrian Peterson doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll return to Redskins]\n\nAnything written about Reed is in danger of plagiarizing everything else written about Reed: He is an unusual, dynamic talent who just needs his health to prove his worth. That could have been written when he was a rookie in 2013 (nine games), when he caught 87 balls and 11 touchdowns in 2015 (career-high 14 games), when he made the Pro Bowl in 2016 (12 games), or when he missed more than half the season in 2017 (six games).\n\nBut it is written here, in 2019, because he is in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol, and though he went through some of the team\u2019s workouts Wednesday and Thursday, he has not yet been cleared to play. That\u2019s distressing, because Washington\u2019s offense is in a spot in which it may have to rely on Reed more than ever.\n\nStop someone on the street, and ask what the local football team\u2019s best threat at wideout would be. Cue the blank stares. Maybe \u2014 maaaaaaybe \u2014 you\u2019d get someone to say \u201cPaul Richardson\u201d because the veteran has speed, or \u201cTerry McLaurin\u201d because they remember him from Ohio State. But the elite downfield threat of DeSean Jackson is long gone. The first-round talent of Josh Doctson was cut at the end of the preseason. The slot excellence of Jamison Crowder walked away in the offseason. As far as the league is concerned, the leftover guys require not only name tags, but also reams of biographical information.\n\nSo Reed is needed because of what this team lacks around him. More than that, though. Reed is needed because of who he is. He needs his head clear, and not just of the concussion. He needs his head clear of everything that has limited him in the past.\n\n[Case Keenum is an unwanted QB who keeps winning jobs. He \u2018wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u2019]\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen frustration, big-time,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a hard time dealing with it. But as I\u2019ve seen him the last few days or so when he\u2019s come back in the building now, he doesn\u2019t look as down as he did in the past. What I\u2019ve seen in previous years when he had injuries, it was like he knew he was nowhere close to getting back. And if he did go out, he wasn\u2019t feeling like himself. Now, I think because his lower body\u2019s good and healthy, I think he\u2019s in a much better place.\u201d\n\nWhat Reed is dealing with is, in some ways, no different than for anyone who decides to make his living by violently slamming into other men.\n\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d said new Washington linebacker Jon Bostic, who played three years with Reed at Florida. \u201cYou put your body in how many car accidents a year, and then you have to be able to go back and play on Sunday. Sometimes, your body just goes through it.\u201d\n\nIn college, Bostic saw how Reed dealt with issues that began with being switched from quarterback (imagine that) to tight end. In the offseasons, Bostic made it a practice to spend Saturdays at the Gators\u2019 facility, watching film.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d look out, and J. Reed would be running the same route over and over and over,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cThe coaches had to tell him, \u2018Go home. You\u2019re going to wear yourself down.\u2019 That\u2019s J. Reed.\u201d\n\n[Landon Collins has always acted older than his age. At 25, he\u2019s a leader for the Redskins.]\n\nBefore the concussion \u2014 suffered on an ugly helmet-to-helmet hit from Atlanta safety Keanu Neal, a hit for which Neal was fined more than $28,000 \u2014 there were plenty of reasons to believe that Reed had built himself back up rather than worn himself down. Bommarito first worked with Reed to get him prepared for the 2013 NFL draft, in which Washington selected him in the third round. But over the past few offseasons, the pair hadn\u2019t been able to work together because Reed\u2019s body wasn\u2019t ready. That lack of offseason training has an impact, Bommarito said, on in-season preparedness.\n\n\u201cIn order to be that elite, you\u2019ve got to be able to train your body in the offseason,\u201d Bommarito said. \u201cJust because you have the genetic potential doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re able to maintain it all year round. The season itself takes a toll on your body. That\u2019s for everybody. But with him, when he was rehabilitating an injury, he couldn\u2019t do that. The overall frustration is he just knows what his body is able to do.\u201d\n\nThis offseason, finally healthy and coming off a year in which he played 13 games and caught 54 balls for a Washington offense that churned through quarterbacks, he pushed his body to do what he knows it can. But in the process, he needed constant reassurance that he was performing to his standard.\n\n\u201cHe would literally break everything out,\u201d Bommarito said. \u201cHe would hit every cut at every angle at every speed. Inside edge. Outside edge. Everything.\u201d\n\nThe overarching question, though, remains: Is he back? This is a league in which early retirements are becoming more common. Jordan Reed isn\u2019t at that point yet. The point he\u2019s at: You\u2019d love for him to catch a break. You\u2019d love for him to play 16 games. You\u2019d love for him not just to go into next season healthy, but you\u2019d love for him to be healthy, period. Not just for football.
