It may be increasing Seven\u2019s exposure to broadcast TV, but it provides a larger audience for advertisers, significant revenue synergy opportunities to take national advertisers into regional Australia, building on the Boomtown campaign, and adds more earnings largely without debt which will help Seven with its significant debt pile without increasing it via a cash offer acquisition.\n\nBut now that Warburton finally has his target, don\u2019t expect this to be his last transaction. Seven still needs to build more scale outside of television, particularly digital to adapt to the rapidly evolving media landscape.\n\nIt\u2019s right out of former Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood's playbook. Cut costs, sell non-core assets, reduce debt, and look for new revenue opportunities.\n\nWhere Warburton is looking to move next only he can be sure. Even with asset sales, Seven\u2019s balance sheet still needs fixing. He will need to be creative. Nil-premium mergers and scrip offers may be the main ingredient in the recipe to turn around Seven by building a large, at scale, multi-platform media business.\n\nInteresting possibility\n\nCombining Seven with outdoor advertiser oOh!media and FM radio network and music streaming business HT &E could be an interesting possibility and there are probably $30 million to $40 million in synergies that could be pulled out.\n\nThe former Network Ten boss has his detractors, particularly after his time at the No. 3 metropolitan broadcaster. But there are clear signs he has learned lessons from his failures \u2013 one being his strength isn\u2019t programming, so he\u2019s opened Seven for business with independent studios again and is hunting for a chief content officer.\n\nWarburton has been given the rope to tackle Seven\u2019s big issues \u2013 as Chanticleer points out balancing the dual roles of transforming the company with the Stokes\u2019 backing but without getting capital from the major shareholder Seven Group Holdings.\n\nHe\u2019s hit the ground running. Don\u2019t expect him to stand still.", "description": "James Warburton has locked in his first two deals as chief executive of Seven West Media but they're unlikely to be his last..", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/59f85a4df3377f2b1e9e7ef0526afe5796c7f704", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
