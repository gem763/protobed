That would appear to be in addition to the 2,814 separated children previously acknowledged in the lawsuit.\n\nOf that earlier group, only about 25 remain in government custody. The others have either been reunited with parents or turned over to other sponsors so they can remain in the U.S.\n\nThe ACLU has been on a winning streak in the case, having faced down the Justice Department on several major issues. But the new argument could be the toughest test for immigrant rights advocates.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, citing the ongoing case.\n\nNeither Health and Human Services or Homeland Security responded to requests for comment.\n\nChristopher Hajec, director of litigation at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, said the ACLU\u2019s demand was striking, beyond the issues of criminal records.\n\n\u201cWhat the ACLU is contending for is the right for these families to be together in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cCriminal sentences aside, no one is stopping them from being together in their home countries.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment citing the ongoing case.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection, which is responsible for the initial decisions on separation, said it was limited in what it could say because of the litigation, but said the agency follows the law when making those decisions on children.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with requirements to protect children under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), there are instances where a child may be separated from a parent solely for the child\u2019s welfare,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nThose include a criminal history, an outstanding warrant, a communicable disease, a bogus family relationship or being caught carrying illegal narcotics at the time of entry.\n\nFamily separations were a major issue last year, after the Trump administration announced its zero-tolerance policy of bringing criminal charges of illegal entry against parents who brought children into the U.S. with them. Though they were always subject to the law, the government had generally shied away from prosecuting parents.\n\nSince there are no family facilities in the criminal justice system, the prosecutions meant the parents were jailed and the children were taken from their custody and sent to the Health Department for care.\n\nAfter a massive bipartisan backlash, President Trump canceled the zero-tolerance policy. Meanwhile a federal judge in California ordered the nearly 3,000 families that had been separated to be reunited.\n\nBut Homeland Security still separates some children when the parents are deemed a danger, either because of signs of abuse or a parent\u2019s illness or criminal record.\n\n\u201cThis is in the interest of the child,\u201d acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan told Congress over the summer.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
