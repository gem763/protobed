REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nThe European football\u2019s ruling body has already said it would examine reports that Turkey footballers performed a military salute in their Euro 2020 qualifier against Albania.\n\nOlivier Giroud scored for France in the 75th minute of Monday night\u2019s match before Kaan Ayhan equalized for Turkey six minutes later. His teammates then lined up in front of the away supporters and saluted.\n\nTurkey\u2019s veteran coach Senol Gunes defended the team\u2019s action, saying it was a gesture of respect for the armed forces rather than a political statement or agitation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to look for malicious intentions in the soldier\u2019s salute. We are doing it to look out for our soldiers. We are not doing it so that our soldiers go and kill people,\u201d Gunes told a post-match press conference.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always asking me about the salute, but it\u2019s way above me.
