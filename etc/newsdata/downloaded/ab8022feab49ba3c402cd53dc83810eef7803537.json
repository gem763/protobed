Heavens no, says pope ally", "language": "en", "text": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 Pope Francis\u2019s economic adviser on Tuesday denied reports the Vatican was at risk of default, saying the allegations were part of a campaign to discredit the pontiff.\n\n\u201cTo say that the Vatican is at danger of default is false,\u201d said Honduran Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga, who heads a group of six cardinals that advise Francis on economic reforms within the Catholic Church\u2019s governing body.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me there is a discrediting strategy underway,\u201d he said in an interview with the Repubblica newspaper.\n\nMaradiaga was reacting to allegations in a book by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, who claims to have seen internal documents that show the Vatican\u2019s finances are in a dire state and the institution is \u201cat risk of default\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey want to undermine the pontificate: first by depicting a Church made up mainly of paedophiles, and now by showing economic negligence. But it\u2019s not true,\u201d Maradiaga said.\n\nNuzzi has made a name for himself by publishing a series of books on Vatican financial scandals. In his latest, published Monday, he analyses the Vatican\u2019s books for 2018, showing them to be in the red and getting worse.\n\nThe book says APSA, a department of the Holy See which oversees real estate and investments, had a deficit of nearly 44 million euros ($49 million) in 2018, compared to 32 million the previous year.\n\nNuzzi said the real estate portfolio was worth an estimated 2.7 billion euros and was badly managed.\n\nSome 800 properties were lying empty, he said, while 15 percent of the 3,200 rented properties were being let for free, and others were being rented out below market prices.\n\nAn internal report by the pope\u2019s advisors, quoted in the book, warns that the Vatican \u201cdeficit is recurrent and structural, and has reached worrying levels, with a risk of default if urgent action is not taken\u201d.\n\nAPSA head Bishop Nunzio Galantino also rebuffed the book\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cThere is neither backruptcy nor default\u201d, just a need for a savings plan \u201cto contain expenses\u201d, he told the Avvenire daily.", "description": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 Pope Francis\u2019s economic adviser on Tuesday denied reports the Vatican was at risk of default, saying the allegations were", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/b2c77f_reports-impending-bankruptcy-are-false-pope-ally-vatican-out-money-heavens-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
