It\u2019s a scrappy survivalist setting, and probably the last place you\u2019d want to flaunt designer outfits.\n\nSo naturally, when game company Bethesda introduced a new $100 premium membership that gave subscribers special access to in-game perks, Fallout 76 players declared class war.\n\nReleased last November, Fallout 76 is not a new game. But when Bethesda rolled out Fallout 1st last week, some longtime players accused the company of pitting premium members against the proletariat.\n\nPlayers who fork out an extra $100 a year will get access to special outfits, infinite item storage, and private servers stocked with their own gear. Unfortunately for the upper crust of this fictional hellscape, Fallout \u2019s non-premium masses say it\u2019s time to eat the rich.\n\n\u201cFuck you guys, I bought fallout 1st on my own terms and I enjoyed it, but those asshats had to hunt me down, Nuke my camp, and attack me relentlessly,\u201d one Fallout player claimed on Reddit this weekend, shortly after the Fallout 1st program debuted.\n\nFallout 1st players are easily identifiable by their icons, their covetable gear, and special moves only available to top-paying members. Even doing one of those special dances is license for a beatdown now, said one player who claimed to have been \u201cbeaten up when I decided to do the Mothman emote [a premium-only dance move] in Vault 51. At least 5 -7 people in teddy bear costumes kept punching me.\u201d\n\nAnother, luckier player, claimed he avoided a brawl, but was told to leave the non-premium area of the game when he did a premium-only robot dance.\n\nIn-game activity is difficult to verify, but other Fallout players say a real-world class divide is spilling into the game.\n\n\u201cPeople are ganging up on Fallout 1st players in adventure mode and grieving [targeting] anyone with the icon lol,\u201d another Redditor posted this weekend.\n\n\u201cWhat a shocker,\u201d one Redditor wrote \u201cA game with themes of class struggle and people struggle against a feature that only benefits players with disposable income.\u201d\n\nBut premium members aren\u2019t the root of the problem, some players say. Since Fallout 76\u2019s launch last year, players have accused Bethesda of tinkering with the gameplay in an attempt to score more money from people who already bought the game.\n\n\u201cThe only way players can meaningfully rebuild West Virginia, it seems, is by doing the exact same thing as in the pre-apocalypse,\u201d gaming site Polygon wrote of the conflict between the game\u2019s anti-capitalist aesthetic and its relentless pressure on players to buy things. \u201cSure, you can farm Atomic Points, but these cosmetics come so fast and furious that the only way to get everything you need is to pull out your wallet.\u201d\n\n\u201c I bought Fallout 1st on my own terms and I enjoyed it, but those asshats had to hunt me down, nuke my camp, and attack me relentlessly. \u201d \u2014 Premium subscriber\n\nAt least one aggrieved Fallout player actually paid to heckle Bethesda over the premium membership. When he noticed that Bethesda hadn\u2019t purchased the url for Fallout 1st, player David Chapman bought it and launched it as a satirical site selling memberships to \u201cFallout FUCK YOU 1st.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since Fallout 76 launched, we have consistently done nothing to improve and evolve the experience based on your shitty feedback. That\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to launch Fallout FUCK YOU 1st,\u201d a premium service that \u201cincludes a host of pointless items and cult bonuses,\u201d the site read.\n\nPlayers like Chapman accuse Bethesda of looking for quick cash-ins, at the expense of the user experience. But on Reddit, some aggrieved fans are leaning toward full communism.\n\n\u201cIf this is what it takes to seed class consciousness I\u2019ll take it,\u201d one wrote.", "description": "\u201cAt least 5-7 people in teddy bear costumes kept punching me,\u201d one member complained.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572375710/191029-weill-fallout76-tease_sk4n1c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
