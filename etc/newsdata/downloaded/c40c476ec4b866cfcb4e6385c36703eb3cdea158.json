We cannot overestimate the value of vaccines \u2013 it's never too late to protect yourself and others.'", "description": "Current freshers are part of the generation whose parents shunned the vaccine in a mass health scare triggered by the now discredited Andrew Wakefield.", "authors": ["Sophie Borland Health Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20200512-0-image-a-31_1572043948902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
