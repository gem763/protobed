A memo to his staff stated that -- without the cash infusion -- the campaign doesn't \"see a legitimate long-term path forward.\"\n\n\"If we're not able to build the campaign organization, which means raise the money that we need to win the nomination, Cory's not going to continue running and consuming resources that are better used on focusing on beating Donald Trump,\" said campaign manager Addis Demissie, who authored the memo.\n\n\u201cThe next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race,\u201d the memo stated. \"This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs bad as it may seem for Booker, his plight is not as serious as the one de Blasio found himself in. He was one of the 10 Democrats on the stage for the September 12 debate in Houston -- the mayor was not there -- and he has qualified for a spot in the next debate on October 15 in Columbus, Ohio, which de Blasio knew he would not make despite the bar being lower than for this month\u2019s forum.\n\nDespite clearing those significant hurdles and being in the top half of what is now a 19-person field, Booker has lagged behind his competitors in fundraising and in the polls.\n\n\"If we can't raise this $1.7 million,\u201d the senator stated, \u201cwe're going to have to make the tough decisions that I think that any campaign that doesn't have a pathway to victory should make.\"\n\nThe most recent national poll, which Fox News conducted from Sept. 15-17, had Booker at 3 percent, well behind the three front-runners: former Vice President Joe Biden with 29 percent, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 18, and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at 16 percent. National polls have consistently shown Biden in first, with Warren and Sanders trading the second and third spots.\n\nBooker, along with all of his fellow Dems, was at Iowa\u2019s Steak Fry on Saturday.\n\nIn New Hampshire polling, a Boston Herald/FPU poll taken Sept. 4-10 had Booker at 1 percent, while an Emerson poll from Sept. 6 to 9 had him at 4 percent.\n\nAnother key state, South Carolina, has not been polled as frequently, and the only one in September -- conducted by CBS, from Aug. 28 to Sept. 4 -- has him at 2 percent.\n\nBooker has not fared much better in his home state of New Jersey, where a Monmouth poll taken from Sept. 12-16 has him at 9 percent, in a distant fourth place behind Biden (26), Warren (20), and Sanders (18).\n\nDemassie also made clear that Booker\u2019s campaign is not the only one in need of a boost and cautioned that the field \u201cis about to narrow dramatically.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Cory-Booker-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
