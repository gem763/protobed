The seventh annual EVE Vegas event brought together players and developers for a weekend of exhibits, charity auctions, presentations and of course lots of partying.\n\nDuring the keynote discussion, CCP Burger, EVE Online\u2019s creative director, gave an overview of EVE\u2019s year to date and talked about a few things that would be coming to the game over the next few months. One of these announcements was a brand new capital vessel being added to the ranks of the ever-popular Triglavian ship line, the Zirnitra dreadnought. The Zirnitra is expected to function like the rest of the Triglavian vessels, equipped with a devastating disintegration beam which increases in potency the longer it is focused on a single target.\n\nAlso introduced during the keynote was a new internal development team inside CCP Games, Team Talos. Talos is a small team charged with rapid iteration on EVE\u2019s features, game balance, and changes intended to shake up the metagame every few weeks. Burger promised a gameplay update release every two weeks for the remainder of 2019.\n\n\u201cThe EVE dev team is relatively small, and when we\u2019ve locked teams down into larger, longer projects, it\u2019s really difficult to disrupt the teams to do rapid iterations, so there have been times where we\u2019ve done very little balancing, very little meta shakeups,\u201d CCP Burger said when asked about the reasons behind creating Team Talos. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal of Talos: we want to use the time from now until the new year to learn how to do this better, communicate this, and prove it.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Zirnitra and the inception of Team Talos and their goals, CCP introduced EVE Online Invasion: Chapter Two, the game\u2019s next expansion. A continuation of the Invasion expansion in May, Chapter Two promises further escalation of the Triglavian NPC invasion across EVE\u2019s New Eden galaxy. It will introduce Triglavian space stations and new Triglavian NPCs who will cause more havoc across large areas of the game unless players can fight them off. The updates to the Triglavian invasions also serve as the primary conduit for players to receive new materials, blueprints and other special items needed to construct the brand new Zirnitra Triglavian dreadnought.\n\nEarly on day two of the conference, CCP Rise, Senior Game Designer for EVE Online, took the stage to further explore Team Talos. Prior to coming to Vegas, Talos had already completed two changes for EVE Online: Warp Drive Online and Howling Interceptors. Warp Drive Online was released two weeks ago and focused on speeding up some of EVE\u2019s larger vessels, decreasing travel time for players looking for fights. Howling Interceptors will release next week, bringing buffs to the combat interceptors in the form of a substantial damage bonus, hoping to make them more viable as true combat ships.\n\nHowling Interceptors (Graphic: CCP Games)\n\nCCP Rise told Kotaku, \u201cWhen new players join the game, they often have visions of wanting to be the fighter jockey in the fast, manoeuvrable ship. Currently the combat interceptors don\u2019t quite match this expectation; we\u2019re hoping to change that.\u201d\n\nAnother topic that dominated discussion during EVE Vegas was the upcoming addition of Korean localisation. CCP CEO Hilmar P\u00e9tursson will be speaking at G-Star in Busan, South Korea, in November to announce EVE Online\u2019s official localisation launch in Korea. EVE already has a small contingent of Korean players who play with the international client. The addition of Korean localisation to EVE Online could potentially add thousands of new players and change the current status quo.\n\nThe event wrapped up with two announcements from the CCP team and the volunteers who staffed the event. Greygal, a player volunteer and fixture at almost every EVE Online event, took the stage and announced that through charity auctions, direct donations, and raffle ticket sales, over $US15,000 ($21,850) had been raised during the course of the three day event for AbleGamers, a charity focused on improving the quality of life for gamers with disabilities. The crowd cheered exuberantly at the outpouring of generosity, and then again to celebrate the hard work and dedication put forth by both CCP and the volunteer staff to running EVE Vegas. The crowd\u2019s reaction overwhelmed CCP Dopamine, one of EVE\u2019s community managers, and left him struggling to compose himself for a few moments on stage.\n\nSorry guys, I got overwhelmed with emotions. There is just so many people that dedicate a huge chunk of their life to making all of this happen. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f #tweetfleet #EveVegas pic.twitter.com/1TPFiLnsLn \u2014 CCP_Dopamine (@onlydopamine) October 28, 2019\n\nThis emotional moment was followed by a less harmonious one when it was announced that there will be no EVE Vegas in 2020. Instead, the event will be replaced by a gathering in San Diego, California. The crowd erupted in a round of boos and jeers at this announcement. EVE Vegas has become a tradition for the EVE community, and has grown substantially each year; to say it is a well-loved tradition is an understatement. CCP Goodfella, Senior Brand Manager for CCP Games, told Kotaku the reason for the change in venue next year is due to the success of the Invasion World Tour: \u201cWe were able to meet many more EVE players by spreading ourselves around the world instead of doing a huge Fanfest in Reykjavik this year. People come to their first EVE-meet because it\u2019s moving closer to them. San Diego has one of the highest densities of EVE players in North America, when compared to any other city on our list of options.\u201d\n\nWith the doors closed on EVE Vegas for this year, and for the near future, EVE players are now looking past it to EVE London, the last event of the Invasion World Tour, happening in late November, as well as to next year, when EVE\u2019s annual Fanfest celebration in Reykjavik, Iceland will return once again. EVE Online is a game about spaceships, politics, destruction and deception, but EVE\u2019s player gatherings prove that its community is much deeper than that. In the immortal words of Permaband, CCP\u2019s in-house band, \u201cThe best ship in the universe is the Friend Ship.\u201d", "description": "The penultimate event of the 2020 EVE Online World Tour concluded on Sunday in Las Vegas, Nevada.
