REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE added 1.1%, rebounding after four straight sessions in the red, after China's commerce ministry said it was is in close communication with Washington over next month's trade talks, and President Donald Trump said overnight that a deal could be struck soon.\n\nGains were shared among oil majors (RDSa.L) (BP.L), financials and miners, which, along with a dip in sterling, put the index on track for its best day in more than five weeks and helped it outperform the broader European index.\n\nChina\u2019s conciliatory statement also offset losses in tobacco firm Imperial Brands, education company Pearson and British Airways owner IAG, all of which warned on results and together wiped off more than roughly 4 billion pounds in market value from the index by 0849 GMT.\n\n\u201cFollowing yesterday\u2019s positive session in the U.S., there seems to be a bit more optimism, but it\u2019s pretty fragile,\u201d Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said. Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said Trump\u2019s trade remarks were outweighing any other \u201cdestabilising factors\u201d surrounding his presidency.\n\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 .FTMC rose after three consecutive sessions of losses but was only up 0.5% by 0904 GMT, with gains kept in check by a weaker sterling as the Brexit malaise showed no signs of easing up.\n\n\u201cA testy session for MPs (members of parliament) yesterday sets the tone for the run in to the Brexit deadline. No-deal remains on the table,\u201d Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.\n\nTRIFECTA OF PROFIT ALERTS\n\nPositive comments around global trade helped the blue-chip index recover from earlier losses that were partly triggered by a drop in tobacco stocks after blu e-cigarette maker Imperial Brands cut its annual sales and profit view.\n\nImperial\u2019s stock (IMB.L) tumbled more than 10% to its lowest since January 2011 and was on track for its biggest one-day drop ever. Shares of rival BAT (BATS.L) shed 2.2%.\n\n\u201c...Hopes had been high that the vaping segment would drive growth as traditional tobacco declines. Increased regulatory scrutiny and retailers reluctant to stock vaping products is seriously undermining that hope,\u201d Hargreaves Lansdown analysts said.\n\nPearson (PSON.L) slid almost 18% to its lowest since March 2018 after saying full-year profit would be at the bottom of its guided range, while IAG (ICAG.L) also dipped 3% after blaming pilot strikes for an expected 215 million euros shortfall in annual profit.\n\nAmong smaller stocks, inkjet printhead maker Xaar (XAR.L) tanked almost 40% after half-year results. Its shares have already lost more than two-thirds in value this year.", "description": "London's FTSE 100 surged more than 1% on Thursday as signals from the United States and China that their trade dispute could soon be put to bed did enough to counteract a trio of profit warnings from blue-chip components.", "authors": ["Shashwat Awasthi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434054566&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0FO", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
