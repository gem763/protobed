In his way: Sergiy Derevyanchenko of the Ukraine.\n\nAfter he lost a majority decision to Canelo Alvarez in September 2018, Golovkin rebounded in June with a fourth-round knockout of Steve Rolls. Now Golovkin (39-1-1, 35 KOs) looks to unleash his knockout power again against Derevyanchenko (13-1, 10 KOs) in their matchup, scheduled for 12 rounds, at Madison Square Garden.\n\nMany fight fans are eager to see a third bout between Golovkin and Alvarez, who fought to a draw in 2017 in their first bout. But GGG will first have to dispatch his Ukranian opponent.\n\nGolovkin, 37, is the clear favorite, with Derevyanchenko, 33, ranked no higher than the fourth best active middleweight as of August based on any of the top recognized rankings.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Josh Peter provides his round-by-round breakdown of the fight:\n\nRound 1: Chants of \u201cTriple G\u201d from the crowd. Sergiy throwing jabs with some success. Golovkin respond with a few jabs took. More jabs from Golovkin. Looks ready to unload a right when the opportunity is there. Down goes Sergiy! From a GGG combo with one minute left in the round. Sergiy beats the 10-count and makes it to the end of the round.\n\nPeter's score: Golovkin 10, Sergiy 8.\n\nRound 2: Sergiy comes out aggressive. Mildly surprising after the knockdown. Golovkin unloads a hook and goes to body. Back comes Sergiy with a straight right. Two fighters traded punches in the middle of the ring. Sergiy firing jabs with effectiveness. But Golovkin draws blood. Lots of blood coming from around Sergiy\u2019s right eye.\n\nGolovkin 20, Sergiy 17.\n\nRound 3: Again, Sergiy moving forward when round starts, despite the knockdown and the serious cut near his right eye. Sergiy lands some big punches. More exchanges. But Golovkin weathering this mini-storm and fires a serious body shot. Both fighters looking game here. Golovkin delivers a big right. Impressive round for Sergiy.\n\nGolovkin 29, Sergiy 27.", "description": "Round-by-round analysis of Saturday night's fight between Gennady Golovkin and Sergiy Derevyanchenko at Madison Square Garden.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published P.M.
