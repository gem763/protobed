Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all'.\n\nThe internet giant has, however, defended its decision to contribute to such groups. It said these 'collaborations' do not necessarily mean 'we endorse the organisations' entire agenda'.\n\nA spokesperson added that Google is 'hardly alone' in contributing to organisations while 'strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy'.\n\n'We've been extremely clear that Google's sponsorship doesn't mean that we endorse that organisation\u2019s entire agenda \u2013 we may disagree strongly on some issues', a statement said.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries are non-profit libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute\n\n'Our position on climate change is similarly clear. Since 2007, we have operated as a carbon neutral company and for the second year in a row, we reached 100 per cent renewable energy for our global operations'.\n\nGoogle is also listed as a sponsor for the 27th Annual Meeting of the State Policy Network - an umbrella organization for a consortium of conservative and libertarian think tanks of which the CEI is a part.\n\nFacebook is also listed among the 33 sponsors for the event.\n\nThe State Policy Network supports the Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank which has previously condemned Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg, 16, of so-called 'climate delusion hysterics'.\n\nThe SPN has also recently launched a 'My Climate Pledge' website, featuring a page of controversial 'mythconceptions' which claim polar bears are 'doing very well' and that 'there is no climate crisis'.\n\nGoogle does state within its US Public Policy, however, that its 'sponsorship or collaboration with a third party organization doesn\u2019t mean that we endorse the organizations' entire agenda, its events or advocacy positions nor the views of its leaders or members'.", "description": "Numerous groups which have campaigned against climate change action are listed on Google's website as among those which\u00a0receive 'the most substantial contributions' from the company.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19580090-0-image-a-48_1570785402758.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
