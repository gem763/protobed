Every single day,\u201d Hassan declared to reporters at the end of an impassioned press conference.\n\n\u201cI believe in clean sport, I\u2019m always clean, I will always be clean. I believe in the Oregon Project. I\u2019ve seen Alberto. He\u2019s worked really hard and that is what I know.\u201d\n\nHassan, who joined the Oregon Project at the end of 2016, pointed out she had been delivering consistent times throughout her career, which includes a World Indoor Championship gold medal in 2016.\n\n\u2013 \u2018A constant athlete\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a top athlete since 2014,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cI\u2019ve won gold medals indoors, Diamond Leagues, I\u2019m always a constant athlete.\u201d\n\nHassan, whose 2019 season has included a world record for the mile set in Monaco in July and four Diamond League victories, said she had been regularly tested throughout the year.\n\n\u201cDo people think if I cheat that I don\u2019t get tested? For five or six months when I\u2019m running personal bests, that I don\u2019t get tested? For five years I\u2019ve been a constant athlete.\u201d\n\nUnder international doping rules, Hassan was required to sever all contact with Salazar this week after the 61-year-old was banned.\n\nShe said Saturday she had formulated her own strategy for a masterful performance at the Khalifa Stadium, where she took the lead on the first lap and set the pace before kicking hard for home with about 250m to go.\n\nKenya\u2019s 2017 world champion Faith Kipyegon took silver while Ethiopia\u2019s Gudaf Tsegay bronze.\n\n\u201cI was so just angry and I could not talk to anyone. I just ran all out. That hard work can\u2019t be beaten by anything,\u201d Hassan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what makes me angry, I have been clean all my life. I work hard. I\u2019m not an emotional person but it makes me so mad.\u201d\n\nSalazar was suspended for a catalogue of doping rule violations uncovered in a years-long investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).\n\nHassan had emphasised in an earlier statement that Salazar\u2019s ban related to activities which took place before she joined the team three years ago.", "description": "Doha (AFP) \u2013 Sifan Hassan said she is willing to undergo daily drug testing to prove she is a clean athlete after completing a stunning World", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/58bb6d_netherlands-sifan-hassan-celebrates-completing-her-10-000m-500m-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
