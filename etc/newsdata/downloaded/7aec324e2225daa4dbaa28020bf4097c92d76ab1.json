No nothing. That was not pressure. I know when I give pressure and that was not pressure.\u201d\n\nIn defense of the White House\u2019s refusal to release the contents of the call, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday, \u201cConversations with foreign leaders are supposed to be confidential\u201d and argued that releasing the details of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine would set a \u201cterrible\u201d precedent.\n\nBut Schiff disagreed, saying that the details would not fall under executive privilege \u201cif those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cThis would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls from members of her party to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, in a letter to colleagues Sunday warned that his administration \u201cwill be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d if the whistle-blower is blocked from Congress.", "description": "Adam Schiff, head of the House Intelligence Committee, suggests impeachment is in order if President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2ZAV98O3C9nMg9wLQcsKJA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/2f59be40-dd55-11e9-97ef-3703d72141eb", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
