The Catch? They\u2019re Not the Big Emitters.", "language": "en", "text": "More than 60 countries are aiming to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050 , according to the United Nations.\n\nThe United Nations announced this week that more than 60 countries have said they will try to reduce their net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. But those countries in 2017, accounted for only 11 percent of global emissions \u2014 in other words, not a lot.\n\nThat\u2019s because the world\u2019s biggest emitters are missing from the list, including the top three: China, the United States, and India. The sizeable emitters on the aspirational net-zero list include Britain, France and Germany. Most of the rest are small countries that have tiny carbon footprints yet are among the worst affected by the ravages of climate change, like the Bahamas, the Maldives, and the Marshall Islands.\n\nHow the net-zero goals will be accomplished is unclear. Some countries may bet on technological advances to capture carbon, which would allow them to continue drilling for oil and gas. Others could seek to offset their emissions by buying credits for green projects like tree-planting programs.\n\nBritain is among the very few that have codified the net-zero goal into law. Chile is working on a law that would make its net zero goal mandatory. Finland has said it will aim for carbon neutrality by 2035, while Norway is aiming for neutrality by 2030.\n\nThe United Nations trumpeted the announcement, but the criteria for being included on the list are vague. Countries can either have \u201cplans to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050\u201d or have it as \u201ca long-term national goal.\u201d Others can be on the list simply by talking about \u201ca long-term strategy for climate-neutrality in line with the Paris Agreement,\u201d which is the 2015 global accord designed to try to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\nNot included in the chart above are the efforts of some state and local governments. Australia hasn\u2019t signed on to a net-zero goal, but four of its states have. Within the United States, New York and California are racing to get to net zero by 2050.\n\nCalifornia, whose economic output surpassed Britain last year, accounted for 1 percent of global emissions in 2017, according to an analysis by Climate Action Tracker, a group that evaluates global climate pledges.", "description": "Those countries accounted for only 11 percent of global emissions in 2017.", "authors": ["Somini Sengupta", "Nadja Popovich"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/un-net-zero-emissions-promo-1569439701376/un-net-zero-emissions-promo-1569439701376-facebookJumbo-v4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
