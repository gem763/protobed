Osaka\u2019s four-day-long \u201ccompliment bar\u201d tested this theory with some teary-eyed results.\n\nAnother group is aiming for a more permanent solution, though. A crowdfunding campaign on Japanese site Makuake is currently raising money to produce a card game called Home Jozu (meaning \u201cGood at Compliments\u201c). This game is all about complimenting your partner and raising each other\u2019s spirits.\n\nThe rules are easy enough that anyone from children to adults can play it. When it\u2019s your turn to do the complimenting, you roll the dice and draw the number of cards indicated by the rules. Your objective is to give your partner a compliment using all the cards you just drew.\n\n\u25bc There are furigana pronunciation guides for all of the kanji characters so it\u2019s easy to understand.\n\nIf your partner likes the compliment you gave them, they can give you a little \u201cthank you\u201d card. They\u2019re divided into \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cexcellent,\u201d so there\u2019s no way to turn down a compliment.\n\n\u25bc Be grateful for every compliment. Every. Compliment.\n\nThe creators of Home Jozu aimed to raise 100,000 yen in 30 days, but as of Day 11, they\u2019ve raised over five times that amount. It turns out a lot of people like the idea of dealing out positivity. The makers have conducted test runs of the game with couples, office workers, and students. At the university where the test run was conducted, over 90 percent of the participants rated the game as being fun.\n\n\u25bc Actual students playing the game and enjoying it.\n\nHome Jozu sounds like a great way for players to raise each other\u2019s spirits, and if you\u2019re studying Japanese, you might even learn some new vocabulary. The game is still taking crowdfunding donations, but it will officially go on sale on Nov 22 for 2,750 yen. The benefit of donating to the fund is that you\u2019ll get it before everyone else.\n\nSources: Net Lab, Makuake\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japanese traditional toy kendama is about to evolve into Dendama\n\n-- Samurai backpacks from Kyoto combine lamellar tradition, awesome style, and modern functionality\n\n-- \u201cIt\u2019s the Japanese!
