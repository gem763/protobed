It also said Virgin failed to publish clear and up-to-date information around the early termination fees on its website.\n\nVirgin now has to respond to the regulator and the final ruling will be published at the end of the summer.\n\nAs I said last year, I believe there is no other option but for Ofcom to tell Virgin it needs to refund all of those people who have had to pay an exit fee if they\u2019ve moved home during a contract and Virgin wasn\u2019t available at the new home.\n\nThis should not only be the fee, it should also include interest, which should reflect the highest amount they could have earned if the money was in a savings account.\n\nWhile it's a big cost to the firm, \u00a3240 is a lot to a consumer in a time of squeezed incomes\n\nThe fee should also be abolished immediately for those moving house and wanting to take Virgin with them.\n\nI also think the fee for exiting the contract - for whatever reason is given - needs to be lowered to something more reasonable. Sky, for example, charge customers a basic service fee for the remainder of their contract if they leave within the fixed-term period. In fact a universal system decided upon by Ofcom for all telecoms providers to calculate the exit fee would be the fairest way to go forward.\n\nNot only is the fee unjust when it comes to moving \u2013 it\u2019s not the customer\u2019s fault Virgin doesn\u2019t supply their new home \u2013 it\u2019s outrageously high.\n\nVirgin can't lose out on up to \u00a3240 every time someone leaves early, especially as there is a good chance whoever moves into the property next may sign up to it and therefore it doesn't really lose out much at all.\n\nWhen someone leaves Virgin early and breaks the contract, they are charged a fee depending on how many months of their contract they have left.\n\nThis amount depends on how much they're currently paying, but the maximum amount is capped at \u00a3240.\n\nVirgin runs on its own fibre network, separate to BT\u2019s Openreach which all the other major providers use. It\u2019s available in around 40 per cent of the UK so the chances of moving to a property where it\u2019s not available are reasonably high.\n\nTherefore it's unlikely to want to pay out compensation lightly, especially as there could be millions of people who have paid these fees in the past.\n\nHowever, while it's a big cost to the firm, \u00a3240 is also a lot to a consumer. Virgin should also benefit in the long run as without these extortionate fees customers will be more likely to stay with it for longer or return next time it is available.\n\nThis is the only ruling I think Ofcom can reasonably take in order to rectify the shoddy behaviour which has been going on for far too long.", "description": "Not only is the fee unjust \u2013 it\u2019s not the customer\u2019s fault Virgin doesn\u2019t supply their new home \u2013 it\u2019s outrageously high and I believe doesn\u2019t reflect the work the firm has to carry out when someone leaves.", "authors": ["Rebecca Goodman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
