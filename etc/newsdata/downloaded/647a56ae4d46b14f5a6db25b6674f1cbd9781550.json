Harden was an effective role player with an average of 12.2 points per game in 2010-11.\n\nThe Rockets acquired Harden prior to the 2012-13 season, and his career took off with 25.9 points per game that year. The seven-time All-Star has become the most dominant scorer in the NBA and has led the league in points per game each of the past two seasons.\n\nThe only thing missing from Harden's Hall of Fame resume is a championship. He's got a great chance to reach that mountaintop this season after Russell Westbrook joined him in Houston.", "description": "James Harden 's rise to  NBA  superstardom was a gradual process, but  Kobe Bryant  predicted big things for the  Houston Rockets  star early in his career...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/357/hi-res-655c3ec4cbf8d8f8f8277e90412e6826_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
