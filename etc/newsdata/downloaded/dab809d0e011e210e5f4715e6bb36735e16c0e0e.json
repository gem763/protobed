Prices of some 297 items rose but 168 items fell, while 58 others were unchanged.\n\nUnderscoring fragile domestic demand, an index stripping away the effects of fresh food and energy costs, which is seen by the BOJ as a key indicator of inflation, was up 0.5% in the year to September, slowing from the previous month's 0.6% gain.\n\nThe BOJ, under its current forecasts issued in July, expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.0% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2020 and fall short of its 2% target for the following two years.\n\nThe central bank has signaled its readiness to expand stimulus as early as next month by issuing a strong warning of overseas risks that threaten the economy and inflation momentum.\n\nPolicy makers worry that the export-reliant economy may lose support from domestic demand if the sales tax hike to 10% deals a blow to consumer sentiment and household spending.\n\nTame consumer spending has kept Japanese firms from raising consumer prices, while prices have declined due to falling energy prices on electricity and gas.\n\nSlowing global demand and the fallout from the more than year-long U.S.-China trade war have hurt exports and business sentiment, clouding the outlook for Japan's economy and leaving the BOJ in a bind.\n\nYears of heavy money printing have failed to prop up prices and change public perceptions that inflation will be subdued, dashing the hopes of BOJ policymakers that aggressive monetary easing will lift Japan sustainably out of deflation.\n\nWith interest rates already at zero and companies hoarding cash instead of spending, many analysts doubt whether additional monetary easing would do much to lift inflation.", "description": "Japan's inflation slows to near 2-1/2-year low, keeps BOJ under pressure", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9H00B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
