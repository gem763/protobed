REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported the Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Liu He, was planning to leave Washington after just a day of minister-level meetings, instead of as originally planned on Friday.\n\n\u201cBarring any surprise today, it looks like their talk is breaking down. The tariff will be hiked. The situation looks dire,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\nS&P500 mini futures slumped as much as 1.3%, though they pared some losses following a tweet from a CNBC reporter that the White House said it was not aware of change in Liu\u2019s plans. U.S. stock futures last stood down 0.7%.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.31% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei slip 0.11%.\n\nThe SCMP report on the U.S.-China trade talks came less than a couple of hours after U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters he thought China wanted to make a trade deal more than he did.\n\nChinese government officials told Reuters that Beijing has lowered expectations for significant progress from this week\u2019s trade talks with the United States, upset by the blacklisting of Chinese companies.\n\nTop negotiators from the two countries were scheduled to meet in Washington on Thursday and Friday to try to end a bruising 15-month-old trade war.\n\nWithout significant progress, Trump is set to hike the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.\n\nChina is unlikely to be willing to make an easy compromise with a U.S. president who seems increasingly vulnerable to domestic political pressure as opposition Democrats seek to impeach him, Mitsubishi\u2019s Fujito added.\n\nU.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden called for the impeachment of Trump for the first time in a deepening partisan fight over a congressional investigation of the Republican president.\n\nBefore the report over stalled trade talks, share prices had gained on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising 0.91% on hopes of a possible compromise between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\n\nIn the currency market, the yen advanced up to 0.4% to 107.035 to the dollar and last stood at 107.33.\n\nThe Swiss franc also gained as much as 0.4% to 0.9923 franc per dollar.\n\nThe Chinese yuan dropped 0.4% in offshore trade to 7.1685 per dollar, touching its lowest in five weeks before bouncing to 7.1461.\n\nThe euro firmed slightly to $1.0986.\n\nSterling wobbled near one-month lows against the dollar and the euro as hopes of a break-through on a key sticking point for a Brexit deal were dashed.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, a coalition partner in the British government, said it would emphatically oppose a reported European Union concession on the Irish backstop under any Brexit deal.\n\nThe pound last stood at $1.2212, near Tuesday\u2019s five-week low of $1.2196.\n\nThe Turkish lira retreated to six-week lows as Turkish troops, together with their Syrian rebel allies, attacked Kurdish militia in northeast Syria, opening a fresh chapter in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old civil war.\n\nThe lira fell to 5.8777 per dollar, the lowest since its flash crash on Aug. 26.\n\nU.S. Treasuries yield slipped back after having risen to 1.594% on Wednesday, pressured partly by this week\u2019s heavy bond supply.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped 3.3 basis points on Thursday to 1.554%.\n\nThe price of front-end Fed funds rate futures gained, however, on increasing bets on more rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nThe November contract is almost fully pricing in a 0.25 percentage point cut on Oct. 30.\n\nOil prices also slid on the report on U.S.-China talks.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 0.55% to $58.00 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.48% to $52.34 per barrel.", "description": "Global stocks tumbled and the safe haven yen and Swiss franc gained in early Asian trade on Thursday, on signs Washington and Beijing were still wide apart on trade issues and were making no progress in deputy-level talks.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439033896&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9826D", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
