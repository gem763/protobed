The board of directors will consist of five people, including David Marcus, Facebook's leader for the project, and representatives from Andreessen Horowitz, PayU, Kiva Microfunds and Xapo Holdings.\n\nThe project hit a major snag on Friday, when Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay and Mercado Pago all said they will no longer be part of the Libra project, following PayPal's decision to pull out earlier last week, and leaving PayU as the only remaining payments company on the council. Support dwindled further on Monday, with the departure of internet company Booking, which operates sites including Booking.com, OpenTable and Kayak.\n\nFacebook announced plans in June to create a new digital currency called libra that would be run by a nonprofit association supported by a range of companies and organizations. The company said at the time that each member of the association will manage one of the \"nodes,\" or locations where transactions involving Libra are validated.\n\nSince then, Facebook has faced an onslaught of criticism from regulators and lawmakers who are skeptical of the company's ability to manage the risks and rigors of financial services given its many snafus in the handling of personal data. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will face lawmakers next week to defend the project at a hearing in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Several members of the committee have asked Facebook to postpone its plans until the proper regulatory mechanisms are in place.", "description": "The Libra Council now consists of 21 members, down from the 28 corporate backers who initially said they would join the project.", "authors": ["Lauren Feiner"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106021691-1563288803354gettyimages-1155893911.jpeg?v=1571083857", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
