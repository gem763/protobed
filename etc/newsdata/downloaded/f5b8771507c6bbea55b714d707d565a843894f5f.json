We are pretty deep into experimenting with hardware and software technologies that will help us control and exploit air power into the future,\u201d Gen. James Holmes, Commander, Air Combat Command, told reporters at the Association of the Air Force Air, Space and Cyber Conference.\n\nPart of the progress with the program, according to Air Force Acquisition Executive William Roper, is due to new methods of digital engineering.\n\n\u201cI have spent six months with our industry leaders and NGAD team looking at examples of applied digital engineering. I\u2019m impressed with what they have done,\u201d Roper.\n\nDigital engineering, as Roper explains it, brings what could be called a two-fold advantage. It enables weapons developers to assess technologies, material configurations and aircraft models without needing to build all of them -- all while paradoxically enabling builders to \u201cbend metal\u201d and start building prototypes earlier than would otherwise be possible.\n\n\u201cThe reward is more than the risk,\u201d Roper said, speaking of the need to \u201ctry something different\u201d and pursue newer acquisition methods which at times results in prototyping earlier in the process than the traditional process typically involves.\n\nAIR FORCE AND DARPA PREPARE TO SHOOT NEW HYPERSONIC WEAPON\n\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory has been working with the acquisition community on digital engineering techniques, often explored through modeling and simulation, for many years.\n\n\u201cDigital engineering is another exciting area and we see the opportunity to accelerate the pace of moving things from the bench level of science and technology into a system, integrating concepts into an operational campaign model,\u201d Tim Sakulich, Executive Lead for Implementing the Air Force S&T Strategy and Air Force Research Laboratory Lead for Materials and Manufacturing, told Warrior in an interview.\n\nCurrent work on a futuristic 6th-gen fighter - to come after and fly alongside upgraded F-35s -- includes development of stealthy drone fighters, hypersonic flight, lasers, new precision weaponry and advanced AI able organize targeting data in milliseconds.\n\nWhile all of these things are of course key parts of the equation, the Air Force Penetrating Counter Air/NGAD program is equally focused on information exchange itself as a defining element of future war. Such an approach, looking beyond isolated systems and weapons themselves, envisions expansive \u201cnetworked\u201d combat with war platforms operating as \u201cnodes\u201d in a larger warfare system of weapons and sensors working together in real time.\n\n\u201cThis approach is one that views military operations in terms of wholistic elements of an information-shooter-effector complex. That will require a lot more going into the design of the next generation of combat aircraft than how fast and far it can fly - or what the numbers of weapons it can carry,\u201d Ret. Lt. Gen. David Deptula, former planner of the US air attacks in Operation Desert Storm and current Dean of the The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies , told Warrior Maven in an interview.\n\nThe NGAD program, which traces its history to the Air Force\u2019s \u201cAir Superiority 2030 Flight Plan,\u201d envisions the possibility of a \u201cfamily of capabilities.\u201d\n\nPENTAGON DRAFTS PLANS TO COMBAT HYPERSONIC WEAPONS ATTACKS\n\nHolmes explained that this study began by examining more than 650 different ideas for 6th-Gen combat, which were then narrowed down to merely a few.\n\nDirected by the Air Force Chief of Staff, service weapons developers who worked on the study have been working in Enterprise Capability Collaboration (ECCT) teams designed to pursue next-generation air superiority.\n\n\u201cWe are moving into a future where aircraft need to be looked at as not just elements of their own, but as a system of information nodes - sensor - shooter - effectors. It is about creating an entire system of systems that is self-forming and self-healing with a greater degree of awareness than an adversary can achieve, and a much greater degree of survivability,\u201d Deputla said.\n\nNorthrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin\u2019s Skunk Works and Boeing\u2019s Phantom Works are all among a handful of industry developers already working on prototype 6th Gen planes and advanced technologies - intended to align with key elements of the Air Force vision. The Air Force itself, while not yet decided upon a particular platform or fixed set of new technologies, is moving quickly beyond the conceptual realm into the active exploration of weapons, sensors, technologies and networks.\n\n\u201cThere are maybe two to three companies that can build high-performance tactical aircraft,\u201d Roper said.\n\nNext-generation stealth technology is also of course a large focus of the technical equation. Newer radar absorbing coating materials, improved IR suppressants or thermal signature management, evolved radar-eluding configurations and acoustic reduction technologies offer a window into current areas of developmental focus. A 2013 Essay by the NATO Parliamentary Assembly Science and Technology Committee discusses the evolution of advanced heat reduction technologies built into the \u201cskin\u201d of an aircraft.\n\n\u201cTo become low-observable in multiple spectrums, advanced skins manage a plane\u2019s heat distribution to foil radar, infrared, and thermal detection systems. These skins do this by distorting or eliminating heat distribution to restructure its thermal shape. They may also be able to heat up or cool down all parts of an aircraft\u2019s surface to perfectly match the surrounding atmosphere, making it virtually undetectable,\u201d the report, titled \u201cThe Future of Combat Aircraft: Toward a 6th Generation Aircraft,\u201d writes.\n\nThe Air Force B-21 Raider, a new stealth bomber expected to emerge in the mid 2020s, is said by developers to incorporate a new generation of stealth - but very few details are available. (For Warrior Maven's report on the B-21 and future stealth -CLICK HERE)\n\nF-35 SET FOR LASER BOOST\n\nEngine development is yet another area of major leap-ahead technological focus, according to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly report. Emerging \u201cVariable Cycle Engines\u201d introduce a third air stream into an engine, which can be controlled by the pilot, the essay explains. The new engines reportedly massively increase an aircraft\u2019s reach, fuel efficiency and speed.\n\n\u201cBy opening or closing the third air stream, the pilot can adjust the fuel intake of the jet engine and optimize its performance,\u201d the report states.\n\nFighter-jet launched laser weapons, expected to be operational by the mid 2020s, are of course part of the planning for 6th-Generation fighters. (for Warrior Maven's Report on Fighter-Jet Launched Laser weapons - CLICK HERE)\n\nTargeting and sensor technology, coupled with advanced guidance systems, are progressing so quickly that ships, fighter jets and land assets can no longer rely upon an existing threat envelope. Simply put, all US military systems will increasingly become more vulnerable as enemies acquire more drones, high-speed fighter jets and longer-range precision weaponry - all enabled by AI-fortified long-range sensors and targeting technology. This includes the emergence of advanced enemy fighter jets, ships, ballistic missiles and weapons such as land-based anti-ship missiles, all further necessitating the need for information and combat awareness in warfare.\n\nThe pace of advancement in computer processing speeds, miniaturization and AI also promise to bring new things to air combat. Algorithms able to instantly gather, compile and organize ISR data and perform real-time analytics will bring faster targeting and attack systems to fighters. AI-enabled real time analytics will, for instance, bring an ability to compare new sensor information against vast databases of relevant data in milliseconds.\n\nARMY DETAILS MISSION OF AI TASK FORCE\n\nInformation dominance, therefore, could among other things enable a fighter jet to both launch attacks and also function as an aerial ISR node. Operating as part of a dispersed, yet interwoven combat sensor network, a fighter could transmit combat relevant data to air assets, ground-based weapons, command and control centers, Navy ships and satellites.\n\nIf a ship, ground or air commander has occasion to see or learn of an incoming attack at greater distance, he or she is obviously much better positioned to defend it. Perhaps, for instance, a medium-range ballistic missile attack is airborne, approaching land based artillery formations or a Carrier Strike Group - what might a Commander do? Should the attack be met with a ground-based interceptor, jammed with electronic warfare technology, hit with a laser or thrown off course in some other way? What if a fighter jet, configured to function as an aerial node in a larger interwoven combat network, were able to detect the approaching attack earlier in its trajectory? From beyond the horizon? Perhaps the jet might itself be positioned to attack, intercept or dismantle the approaching missile - or at least provide early warning to the weapons intended target. In this case, more \u201ctime\u201d simply means more options to inform a commander\u2019s decision cycle.\n\nReferring to this emerging tactical complex as a \u201ccombat cloud,\u201d Deptula posited that, for instance, an aircraft such as an F-35 could cue or alert an Aegis Navy Cruiser about an incoming attack, therefore offering ship-based radar, fire control and interceptor weapons a vastly improved envelope with which to take out an attack. Thus, an interconnected web of attack, targeting and information nodes can better sustain operations should one node be destroyed, and \u201csensor-to-shooter\u201d time can be massively accelerated.\n\n\u201cFor an adversary, this is a difficult concept to attack,\u201d Deptula said.\n\nTime is of course of the essence when it comes to air attack, air-to-air warfare and any kind of air-ground-surface coordination. Getting ahead of or inside an enemy\u2019s \u201cdecision cycle,\u201d is a phenomenon long-described by air warriors as completing the OODA loop - Observation, Orientation, Decision, Action - faster than an enemy, to win a dogfight. This is also one reason why hypersonic weapons are being pursued and tested with such vigor by the US and its major rivals. A weapon, drone or air asset of any kind traveling at five times the speed of sound presents a very serious \u201ctime\u201d challenge when it comes to defending attacks.\n\nARMY DEVELOPS NEW DRONE-KILLING TECHNOLOGY\n\nWhile the notion of \u201cmanned\u201d hypersonic flight is considered to be very far away, hypersonic weapons - to be followed by hypersonic drones - are moving closer to operational status. This greatly impacts the Air Force\u2019s Penetrating Counter Air program because a 6th-generation aircraft might, for instance, be able to fire air-launched hypersonic weapons or launch hypersonic attack drones. It goes without saying that the faster an attack or ISR mission can operate in high-threat or enemy territory, the more its threat window can decrease. (For Warrior Maven's report on Air Force efforts to accelerate hypersonic weapons - CLICK HERE)\n\nInterestingly, anticipated speed and range of enemy weapons and sensors continues to motivate ongoing discussion about whether \u201cdogfighting\u201d itself could become obsolete. Identifying, and potentially destroying an enemy aircraft before being seen is a key premise informing F-35 strategy. While the stealth fighter is engineered to dogfight, its Electro/Optical Targeting System and Distributed Aperture System are specifically designed to enable early detection of enemy fighters. The concept is, quite simply, to destroy an enemy before you yourself are seen, potentially preventing an enemy from coming close enough to require a dogfight.\n\nMore Weapons and Technology -WARRIOR MAVEN (CLICK HERE)--\n\nKris Osborn of WARRIOR MAVEN (CLICK HERE) can be reached at krisosborn.ko@gmail.com", "description": "Drone fighter jets, hypersonic attack planes, artificial intelligence, lasers, electronic warfare and sensors woven into the fuselage of an aircraft are all areas of current technological exploration for the Air Force as it begins early prototyping for a new, 6th-Generation fighter jet to emerge in the 2030s and 2040s.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/stealth-jet-lockheed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
