Unexpectedly the eagle flew straight to Iran, where it sent the huge backlog of messages.\n\nThe price per SMS in Kazakhstan was about 15 roubles (18p; 30 US cents), but each SMS from Iran cost 49 roubles. Min used up the entire tracking budget meant for all the eagles.\n\nThe Russian researchers are volunteers at the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Novosibirsk. Their crowdfunding appeal, which has paid off more than 100,000 roubles (\u00a31,223), was called \"Top up the eagle's mobile\".\n\nImage copyright Rrrcn screenshot Image caption The eagles' winter migration routes from Central Asia (RRRCN website)\n\nThe SMS messages deliver the birds' coordinates as they migrate, and the team then use satellite photos to see if the birds have reached safe locations. Power lines are a particular threat for the steppe eagles, which are endangered in Russia and Central Asia.\n\nThey are currently tracking 13 eagles. The birds breed in Siberia and Kazakhstan, but fly to South Asia for the winter.\n\nMegafon's offer to bail out the team, reported by RIA Novosti news, means they can continue monitoring the eagles' routes, collecting vital data to help their survival.\n\nYou might also like:", "description": "Russian scientists tracking eagles got huge SMS bills when some birds flew to Iran and Pakistan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/082A/production/_109409020_eaglegettybodycreative.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
