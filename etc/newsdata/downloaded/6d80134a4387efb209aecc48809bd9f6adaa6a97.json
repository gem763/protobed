Their charging stations are the fastest in the world, and are fuelling the shift to electric vehicles in Europe.\"\n\nMr Albanese will stress that other minerals such as rare earths, copper and silver, of which Australia has vast reserves, will become increasingly vital as energy and other technologies evolve.\n\nBut he will reassure that these new and developing industries will not come at the immediate expense of \"traditional industries'' such as coal.\n\nHe will say an estimated 15.5 million tonnes of coking coal needed to produce the global growth in wind farms forecast by 2030 was the equivalent of three years' production from the Moranbah North coal mine in Queensland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the May 18 election, marginal seats in central and north Queensland, which Labor had hoped to win, swung against it due to Labor's perceived disdain for coal mining.\n\nSimilarly, frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon was given a fright in his supposedly safe Hunter Valley seat.\n\nSince the election, Mr Albanese has also sought to build bridges with the business community, which was derided by Labor before the election as \"the top end of town''.\n\nMr Albanese will make further overtures towards business today.\n\nInvestment allowance\n\n\"We understand that successful businesses and vibrant economy are essential prerequisites for job growth,'' he will say.\n\n\"Ensuring they thrive and flourish is vital to our national prosperity.''\n\nIn this vein, he will again call on the government to bring forward from the May budget its plans for an investment allowance to encourage business investment and stimulate the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabor took an investment allowance to the last election as a substitute for the company tax cuts it opposed and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has flagged there will be such a policy in the budget, scheduled to be handed down on May 12.\n\n\"I call upon the government to introduce an upgraded investment guarantee as part of a measured economic stimulus package to boost our sluggish economy,'' Mr Albanese will say.\n\n\"A bring-forward of infrastructure investment combined with increased business investment would create jobs in the short term as well as lift productivity.''\n\nMr Albanese will also chip the government over a lack of settled energy policy, saying this, too, was acting as a deterrence to business investment.", "description": "Anthony Albanese has recast Labor's climate change policy pitch to one of job creation and economic growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2427%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/55c32aae2b82e9935c30dac8e2bf4155aeb657f8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
