I ripped the plastic seal around the box like a wild animal that hasn\u2019t been fed for weeks, turned the handset on, and rushed through the setup menus so I can get to the camera app. And then it struck me like a dagger in the back: there\u2019s no pro photography mode.\n\nI\u2019ve been truly impressed with the Pixel series\u2019 cameras for years, but never quite got my hands on one. So naturally, my expectations were high. I couldn\u2019t wait to put the Pixel 4 to the test. But now I\u2019m hesitant to take it out for a spin.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: a big part of the photography process is taking all the guesswork out of a scene. Without a dedicated pro mode that lets you fine-tune the camera settings to your surroundings, you leave all that to the phone itself \u2014 and that makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI recently wrote about the Huawei P30 Pro\u2018s camera. While it snaps excellent pics (for a phone), it suffers from some pretty serious flaws that make it almost unusable for (street) photography. I also complained about the limited control in its camera software\u2019s pro mode. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered the Pixel 4 has no pro mode at all.\n\nBy comparison, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy series (especially S8 and newer) have a wonderfully thorough UI for fastidious photographers, including control over shutter speed, exposure, aperture, white balance, and manual focus. Quite frankly, its pro mode is better than in some real cameras I\u2019ve reviewed in the past \u2014 like the Ricoh GR III.\n\nIt stings because Google excels in computational photography\n\nIf there\u2019s any company whose take on a pro camera mode I want to see, it\u2019s Google. After all, computational photography is one of the things it does best. That\u2019s why people are porting its camera app to other devices.\n\nI understand I can easily download an app that offers more control over shutter speed, white balance, and exposure, but I was hoping Google would have thought about that ahead of time \u2014 especially because it does computational photography so goddamn well.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big conundrum here. My guess the reason why Google hasn\u2019t included a pro mode in the Pixel is precisely because it relies on computational photography so much. This means the camera snaps multiple shots \u2014 at different exposure and shutter speed \u2014 before it stitches together a final image.\n\nThat, in turn, makes the inclusion of a pro mode a tall order \u2014 and sometimes straight up undesirable. My colleague Napier Lopez (who, by the way, hates how much he loved the Pixel 4) tells me he\u2019s often failed to outdo the Pixel\u2019s camera by manually tweaking the settings.\n\nBut still, I wish Google had extended an olive branch to creatives and included a place in the app where photographers can toy around with the various camera parameters \u2014 for when you\u2019re feeling like experimenting, if not for anything else.\n\nBecause Google understands its processing so well, it\u2019s the only software maker I trust to add pro controls without degrading image quality.\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel the lack of a pro mode is particularly galling because Google has pushed the Pixel\u2019s camera as its main differentiator for years. I mean, it brought legendary photographer Annie Leivbovitz to the Pixel launch event to show off its camera chops.\n\nI guess I simply feel let down the Big G didn\u2019t bother to give photographers a little more control over their craft right in the camera app. In the end, a camera is only as good as it makes a photographer feel. The Pixel 4 makes me feel a little uninspired.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "Google is goddamn good at computational photography... which makes me really angry that the Pixel 4's camera app doesn't have pro mode.", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fgoogle-pixel-4-pro-mode-photography-camera.jpeg&signature=c5ad4ed32aefcb10cbfcabf4e3f4dce2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
