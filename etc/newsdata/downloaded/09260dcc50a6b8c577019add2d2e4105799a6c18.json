But on the day I did it, I was fully conscious that was exactly what I was doing.\u201d\n\nThe court heard he had emigrated to New Zealand in 2002 and worked on visual effects for the Lord of the Rings films before moving back to East Horsley, Surrey with his wife.\n\nWhile living in New Zealand, the defendant got a two dogs called Boris and Nikita and when the former became ill and had to be put down, he got a mastiff puppy Enzo.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen Nikita died, the defendant became \"scary\" to live with and blamed his wife for the death of his pet, the court heard.\n\nHe moved with Enzo back into his parent's home but became \"frustrated and angry\" with his parents for leaving the window open while the dog had a tooth infection.\n\nThe day before the killings, Mrs Koudriavtseva told a friend that her son had become abusive after two years living with her and obsessed with his dog to the point where she could not open a window in case it got a cold.\n\nThe next morning, she called her friend at the pharmacy and said: \"I'm scared to go home. I'm terrified what he can do.\"\n\nProsecutor Paul Jarvis said he \"clearly valued\" the mastiff on a par with his parents, and first thought about killing them because of their relationship to Enzo four months before he did.\n\nAfter he fatally knifed his parents Koudryavtsev left with the hound.\n\nUpon his arrest in Chiddingford, Surrey on May 23, police seized two blades from the flat, a hunting and combat knife.\n\n(Image: David Sutherland)\n\nIn a police interview, the defendant told how he loved Enzo more than his wife and had a strained relationship with his parents, who did not appreciate that dogs were \"equal to humans\".\n\nHe told how he had practised martial arts with knives for the past 17 years.\n\nKoudryavtsev said he had taken his hunting knife and grabbed his mother by the head and stabbed her in the neck repeatedly before walking into the bedroom and stabbing his father twice.\n\nAfterwards he said he panicked about Enzo's future and set about finding him a good home, which he refused to reveal to police.\n\nJudge Nicholas Hilliard QC said: \"A friend said the two of them were very much in love and very proud of you and your achievements.\"\n\nThe defendant made no reaction as he was led from the dock.\n\nA psychological report compiled by Dr Ian Cumming found Koudryavtsev suffered from \"anger and rage linked to a personality structure where he has put his needs above his parents'.\"\n\nHe said the killings resulted from \"pre-morbid personality traits and the long standing frustration with his parents.\"", "description": "Sergey Koudryavtsev killed his university lecturer parents at their home in Kensington, west London, over their treatment of his pet dog", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Pa", "Afp Getty Images", "David Sutherland"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558234.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sergey-Koudryavtsev.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
