I\u2019m surrounded by twinkly lights deep in the basement of Selfridges.\n\nTo my left is a shelf stacked with shimmering crystals, while in front of me sits a woman with a kind face and long brown hair.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to talk to Princess Margaret. But so far... nothing.\n\nTrue, the Princess has been dead for 17 years but that proved no obstacle for actress Helena Bonham Carter, who says she asked the Queen\u2019s late sister for some acting tips just the other day.\n\nMs Bonham Carter, of course, plays the role of a middle-aged Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown and she told the Cheltenham Literature Festival how, with the help of a medium, she gained some valuable Royal insights into how the Princess should be portrayed on screen.\n\nGiulia Crouch with psychic Angela Jensen, above. Are we too early for the Princess, I wonder? She was a famously late riser, after all. But Jayne is having none of it\n\nIt\u2019s all about the fags, apparently. \u2018Get the smoking right,\u2019 said the spirit of Margaret.\n\nAnd according to Ms Bonham Carter, the Princess then continued: \u2018I smoked in a very particular way. Remember the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking.\u2019\n\nCan just anyone talk to the Princess? In life it was discouraged unless she spoke to you first. But what about now \u2013 in October 2019, in Selfridges?\n\nJayne Wallace, one of two self-styled \u2018Psychic Sisters\u2019 who has worked from the basement of the vast department store in London\u2019s Oxford Street for nearly 15 years and is well respected among fans of the paranormal, is rather doubtful.\n\n\u2018The Princess just has no reason to talk to you,\u2019 she explains. \u2018Maybe if you had something of hers \u2013 a physical object \u2013 we could tap into the vibration of the energy. Or if she was your Auntie Marge, that would work. But she\u2019s not and it\u2019s very unlikely she\u2019ll come through.\u2019\n\nAccording to Ms Bonham Carter, the Princess then continued: \u2018I smoked in a very particular way. Remember the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking'\n\nShe didn\u2019t. Within minutes Jayne, 52, shrugs and says: \u2018Nope. I haven\u2019t got anything. I\u2019m just being truthful. You could try with Sue.\u2019\n\nSue is Jayne\u2019s Psychic Sister. \u2018She\u2019s in in half an hour.\u2019\n\nAre we too early for the Princess, I wonder? She was a famously late riser, after all.\n\nBut Jayne is having none of it. \u2018I work on integrity,\u2019 she continues. \u2018If she doesn\u2019t come through, she doesn\u2019t come through. Others might say they\u2019ve got her for a bit of media attention. I won\u2019t do that.\u2019\n\nShe had little to say on Royal matters, but Jayne did have some unsettlingly pertinent comments to make about my love life and I leave for my next appointment decidedly discombobulated.\n\nMy next meeting is with Philena Bruce, a 69-year-old palm reader and psychic, who lives at the top of an old house in Kensington, West London. She greets me in a flowing chiffon gown paired with green Crocs.\n\nDoes she know something about the future of fashion? The chatter is friendly as we climb a grand stairway to her flat, but as soon as we cross the threshold, the mood changes and strict instructions follow.\n\n\u2018Take your shoes off and sit down on that chair while I do a few things in the lounge,\u2019 she says. \u2018There\u2019s paper on the floor. Don\u2019t move it.\u2019\n\nI do as I\u2019m told and wonder what I\u2019ve got myself in to \u2013 aside, that is, from a weird Aladdin\u2019s cave.\n\nThere are nicknacks and brightly coloured decorations everywhere, including a stuffed crow dangling from the ceiling.\n\nEvery inch of the room is covered. Candles flicker and there are thick, patterned rugs on the floor.\n\nHer landline rings and Philena fusses trying to turn off the answerphone. \u2018If I\u2019ve gone into a trance and the doorbell goes, you\u2019ll have to run down those stairs and let them in \u2013 it\u2019ll be the mice men. I\u2019ve got mice.\u2019\n\nMice?\n\n\u2018They only turn up if the place is completely still,\u2019 she reassures me.\n\nI\u2019m hoping this particular trance is as raucous as possible. I ask where Princess Margaret is. Could she be here at the top of a mansion block, just a few hundred yards from her former grace-and-favour apartment at Kensington Palace?\n\nTrue, the Princess has been dead for 17 years but that proved no obstacle for actress Helena Bonham Carter, who says she asked the Queen\u2019s late sister for some acting tips just the other day. Ms Carter is pictured above with Olivia Colman in The Crown\n\n\u2018She\u2019s anywhere and everywhere,\u2019 explains Philena. \u2018She\u2019s on a different vibration length.\n\n\u2018There is a lot of dark energy around at the moment so it might be painful for her to come through.\u2019 I\u2019m mystified, but continue nodding in agreement.\n\n\u2018She might or she might not talk to us. It\u2019s not like a telephone service.\u2019\n\nHow old is she? Ageless, apparently. \u2018When you become a spark of light, age is not relevant,\u2019 explains Philena. \u2018It\u2019s a concept of this planet. But often, when spirits appear to people, they present themselves at the age that person remembers them at.\n\n\u2018If you have an elderly mother who dies and turns up as a ten-year-old, you wouldn\u2019t recognise her. It\u2019s just a matter of getting really relaxed and asking her to turn up.\u2019\n\nSo we begin. There\u2019s silence for three or four minutes and I start thinking about the mice \u2013 until, finally, it happens.\n\n\u2018Great sadness!\u2019 booms Philena. \u2018That\u2019s the first emotion I get.\u2019\n\nHer eyes are closed and her breathing exaggerated. It looks as though we are in touch with the Princess herself, and she has some startling advice for these uncertain times.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s saying people ought to have a lot more fun,\u2019 says Philena.\n\n\u2018Margaret had fun \u2013 she might have overdone it, but she tried to have fun. And that is the only way that you can get through life.\u2019\n\nA dramatic pause.\n\n\u2018Yes! Now I\u2019m getting it. The sadness!\u2019 We\u2019re back to the sadness.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s so much more she could have done. She enjoyed herself but there\u2019s so much more she could have done to help people. She could have used her life completely differently.\u2019 The monologue ends with a big sigh.\n\nAnd what about Helena Bonham Carter \u2013 does Princess Margaret have any more advice for her?\n\nOnce again it\u2019s the spirit of Margaret who chooses to reply: \u2018She can ask me herself,\u2019 she snaps.\n\nI\u2019m not much enlightened as I leave, but I am a little shaken. Moreover, I\u2019m 15 minutes late for my next meeting, where I\u2019m immediately informed that Margaret will be unimpressed.\n\n\u2018The Princess is not one for patience,\u2019 decrees Angela Jensen, a glamorous psychic from Camden Town, North London, with long blonde hair, chunky silver bracelets, painted toenails in high wedges and long false nails.\n\nIn a sing-song Welsh accent she explains that we are honoured: Margaret is willing to talk through her. But that means she\u2019ll have to \u2018block off\u2019 my energy in order to tap into hers. I\u2019m told to sit on a chair but then I\u2019m reprimanded when I try to cross my legs.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t do that in front of me,\u2019 says Angela sternly. I don\u2019t understand the significance but obey. It looks like we\u2019re starting already.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very particular about my hair,\u2019 continues Angela, now starting to gesture wildly \u2013 and I gather it\u2019s Margaret herself who\u2019s speaking.\n\nShe mimes smoking, mutters a lot, makes over-the-top expressions and then squeezes my face.\n\n\u2018A little bit of colour wouldn\u2019t hurt you\u2026 No doctors, no doctors, no doctors.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s incoherent. I\u2019m confused \u2013 but nothing surprises me now. It continues: \u2018Don\u2019t talk about my personal life. Do you understand me? If you do I will get very upset.\u2019\n\nShe grabs my notepad from my hands and hurls it across the room. \u2018I like to make an entrance,\u2019 smiles \u2018Margaret\u2019 unnervingly.\n\n\u2018The lady who\u2019s playing me in the film, my God, she\u2019s going to get recognised now\u2026 The people you rely on, don\u2019t trust them. I never trusted anybody.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m struggling to keep up. It turns out this Margaret, too, approves of the decision to cast Bonham Carter in The Crown. \u2018She likes her because she does her exactly right \u2013 and she\u2019s a bit loopy like her. She\u2019s an individual person. She\u2019s got the same attitude. She\u2019s a hoot!\n\n\u2018Other Royal roles will come to Helena in the future too, that\u2019s what Margaret is saying to me.\u2019\n\nOnce again this Margaret is pleased with the choice of Bonham Carter in the role. \u2018She says it\u2019ll do great things for her career. She\u2019ll go to America. I\u2019m getting a strong sense of America'\n\nAngela \u2013 who likes to be referred to as \u2018Angee\u2019 \u2013 is up and down, now, back and forth, jerking about like a wind-up toy. Margaret takes over, once again, with some personal remarks in my direction.\n\n\u2018You\u2019d suit red actually,\u2019 she says. \u2018I know you like it. You\u2019re very particular about what you wear, like me. But sort your teeth out.\u2019\n\nWhat? Then things go completely off piste.\n\n\u2018Little George will do very well.\u2019 The \u2018Princess\u2019 is nodding vigorously. \u2018And there will be two more Royal children\u2026 Don\u2019t go to Ireland because you won\u2019t make any money there\u2026 She was very kind\u2026\u2019\n\nCompletely bonkers? No, its perfectly normal, insists Angee.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a trance medium so she comes through me and uses me as a vessel. When she takes over, she takes over.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s been an education \u2013 and there is still one appointment with the Princess to come.\n\nDressed in trendy checked trousers, smart white trainers and a leather jacket, Chris Riley looks more a PR executive than a psychic. He\u2019s only 25 and employs 20 people to \u2018read\u2019 for him in the company he\u2019s built up mainly through Facebook.\n\n\u2018I grew up seeing things that were going to happen,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d say strange things as a kid. I could predict what would happen the next day.\u2019\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t mean mundane stuff. When Chris was nine, he predicted his house in the Essex countryside would be broken in to the next day.\n\nIt was, and in this Damascene moment he knew he should use his gift for good. Now he has a host of loyal clients, including reality TV star Gemma Collins.\n\nSo can I speak to Princess Margaret? He goes misty-eyed, barely blinking as he stares intently to the left. Is he OK?\n\n\u2018She was very bold and very direct. I don\u2019t think people always liked it. She upset a lot of people, I don\u2019t think she meant to.\u2019\n\nUnlike the medium before him, it\u2019s clear Chris\u2019s approach is more about interpreting a feeling than letting his body being taken over by Princess Margaret herself.\n\nI am relieved.\n\n\u2018It was difficult for her to let people in. She was very private,\u2019 he continues.\n\nAnd now he\u2019s adamant: \u2018She doesn\u2019t want her illness to be shown on the Netflix show.\n\n\u2018She is pleased that the show is being made but she wants it to be done in the right way.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s going to bring out a lot of stuff that hasn\u2019t been spoken about and people don\u2019t want to hear about. She thinks it\u2019s delving into things that are too private.\n\n\u2018There will be some very emotional scenes in the programme, I can tell you that.\u2019\n\nOnce again this Margaret is pleased with the choice of Bonham Carter in the role. \u2018She says it\u2019ll do great things for her career. She\u2019ll go to America. I\u2019m getting a strong sense of America.\u2019\n\nDoes Margaret have any regrets? \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019 states Chris emphatically. \u2018None.\u2019\n\nNor me. But it\u2019s already 5pm and I can feel the spirit of the Princess more strongly than ever.
