This is really fascinating.\u201d\n\nBill said: \u201cHe fought and he fought as a warrior. When you win the Military Medal, you get that for something heroic.\u201d\n\nAnt said: \u201cTo fight at The Battle of the Somme and to be awarded the Military Medal, he was a hero. It\u2019s quite emotional.\u201d\n\nThe trail then moved to Dec\u2019s paternal line and the pair headed to the Royal Chelsea Barracks to find out more about his great, great grandfather, James Donnelly, who was in the Crimean War.\n\nBut Dec discovered that James was not only court marshalled, but was also labelled a deserter.\n\nMilitary expert Glenn Fisher told Dec: \u201cIt would be quite a shame and a disgrace really. He\u2019s gone for a soldier and he\u2019s deserted after six weeks. It would have brought shame upon his family.\u201d\n\nDec, 44, read a document which said James was \u201ctried and imprisoned for habitual drunkenness\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt was not what I was expecting at all, nowhere near. I didn\u2019t ever expect it was going to be a colourful history.\u201d\n\nAnt & Dec\u2019s DNA Journey will be shown next month on ITV.", "description": "Best pals Ant and Dec discovered a lot about their families as they filmed new documentary Ant & Dec\u2019s DNA Journey", "authors": ["Tom Bryant", "Image", "Goffphotos.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-ITV-STUDIOS-GLOBAL-ENTERTAINMENT-Photocall-MIPCOM-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
