To keep pushing and keep our attitude was really good. That showed by getting the try at the end.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

First try was born out of his brute strength as he burst through a tackle attempt from Kalamafoni and carried two over the line with him. Second try was more of a case of right place, right time, and he was a constant problem for Tonga to deal with all afternoon.

Made a strong tackle on Tuitavake in the second half, but left the field with what looked like an injury soon after.

We've got no injuries and we know we can play better. Sometimes rugby is like that and the ball just doesn't stick. We left a number of points out there. But I'm so pleased with the attitude of the players. That's two Tests in a row that we haven't conceded a try. We know we can better and that's the goal for the USA game.\n\n\u201cDuring the lead up to the World Cup we had a number of coaches and specialists in. One person we were lucky enough to have in was Sir Alex Ferguson. One of the things his teams were renowned for was \u2018Fergie time\u2019. And the message was \u2018be patient\u2019 and that's what I enjoyed about our team today, there was no sign of panic and they kept on playing good rugby and the try came.\n\n\u201cIt might have been easier if it had come a little bit earlier, but it came and that's a good sign.\u201d\n\nThe England head coach has previously talked down the need to make a fast start to the tournament, and despite seeing New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland all make impressive statements early on, the Australian stressed the need for the side to build their performances as the tournament goes on.\n\n\u201cThe thing about the World Cup, having been to a few of them, is the World Cup is not a 100m sprint,\u201d he added. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to come out of the blocks and be absolutely fantastic now, what you have to be is steady, you have to be prude and you have to have a mindset of improvement and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got.\n\n\u201cWhat percentage do we need to improve? I don\u2019t know, but I know we\u2019ll keep improving and that\u2019s the mindset of the team.\u201d\n\nTwo of England\u2019s four tries came from Manu Tuilagi, the wrecking-ball centre who by a country mile the best player out on the pitch, yet Jones still believes he is yet to reach his peak.\n\n\u201cManu's increasingly getting close to his best,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe's training well and is in great physical nick. He enjoys being around the boys. The boys love playing with him and for a Samoan to play against Tongan it's a pretty special occasion.\n\n\u201cAs it was for Billy today to play against his own country. And they wanted to hammer him! He handled it really well. Manu will only get better as the tournament goes on.\u201d\n\nJones played down injury fears over Jonny May and Henry Slade, with the former replaced early in the second half due to cramp and the later not suffering any lasting damage after a knock to the same knee that he injured last month.\n\nThe squad will travel to Kobe on Monday where they will prepare for their second Pool C encounter against the United States, before a nine-day gap to their crunch match with Argentina.", "description": "Eddie Jones was relieved to see his England\u00a0side secure a bonus-point victory over Tonga\u00a0in \u2018Fergie Time\u2019 after they left it late with Luke Cowan-Dickie\u2019s 77th-minute try ensuring they claimed a maximum five-point haul from their opening Rugby World Cup match against Tonga.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/16/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
