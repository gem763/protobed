But when he attacks Fox News, as he did Thursday, his tone becomes one of bewildered disappointment. \u201c@FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore,\u201d he moaned. \u201cIt is so different than it used to be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an understandable disappointment, coming on the heels of a Fox News poll that showed 51 percent of Americans want Trump impeached and removed from office. The president sees Fox News as part of his propaganda arm, an institution full of advisers, friends and future administration officials. And since it is those things, it can be confusing when even the mildest criticism airs.\n\nRecently, Trump has been pairing his criticisms of Fox with threats. \u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet,\u201d he tweeted in August. \u201cFox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d On Thursday, he followed up his anti-Fox News tweets with one in favor of a competitor : \u201cThank you to @OANN One America News for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting. It is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new, consistent and powerful VOICE!\u201d\n\nMore than any other in Fox News\u2019s history, this is a threat with teeth. Somehow even more pro-Trump and less journalistic than Fox, OANN, or One America News Network, is on the way to becoming Trump\u2019s favorite network \u2014 and as a result, one of Fox News\u2019s biggest challengers. And it\u2019s doing so by taking a page right out of Fox\u2019s playbook.\n\nFox News appeared on the scene in 1996 with two major advantages: an underserved market and powerful friends. At the time, there was no cable news network that specifically catered to the conservative audience that had flocked to Rush Limbaugh\u2019s wildly popular radio show, which went national in 1988. Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes, Fox\u2019s founders, believed they had identified a market with vast potential.\n\nLaunching a cable news network required more than deep pockets and a good idea. As Fox News was getting ready to go on the air, it found itself shut out of a major market, New York City. So Murdoch turned to a powerful Republican ally: Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani strong-armed Time Warner, the city\u2019s cable provider, and ensured that as Fox News took off, New Yorkers could tune in. Four years later, the network developed close ties with the George W. Bush campaign (Bush\u2019s cousin, John Ellis, was the head of the \u201cdecision desk\u201d at Fox News on election night in 2000) and the Bush administration. Fox News could now claim powerful friends and political influence.\n\nFox News also had a clear adversary: CNN. Murdoch had been at odds with CNN founder Ted Turner for more than a decade and was looking for a way not only to best his nemesis but to discredit his work. What better than a channel that would sneer at the \u201cClinton News Network\u201d for its rampant \u201cliberal bias?\u201d\n\nFox News was soon setting the agenda for a major stories from the Monica Lewinsky scandal to the recount fight in 2000 to the tea party protests in 2009. In the process, it became a key institution of Republican power.\n\nWhen OANN began broadcasting in 2013, it didn\u2019t immediately challenge Fox, which was so dominant that the notion of an effective threat from the right seemed laughable. Instead OANN joined other new outlets that sought to broaden the range of right-wing offerings. There was the Blaze, launched by conservative host Glenn Beck in 2012 after he left Fox. Popular right-wing sites like Newsmax and Breitbart started their own networks, too. These outlets sensed a market beyond Fox: viewers who wanted border walls and birtherism and other ideas that seemed fringe to the mainstream but fascinated the base.\n\n[The GOP\u2019s questions to Mueller seemed bizarre \u2014 unless you watch Fox News]\n\nAn anti-establishment wave was rippling through the conservative base, aimed not just at the Republican Party but at leaders in the conservative movement. In 2012, when they were challenging Mitt Romney for the Republican presidential nomination, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum \u2014 both former Fox contributors \u2014 openly attacked Fox as too moderate.\n\nWhile nonconservatives grew more concerned about the network\u2019s power over GOP politics, conservatives were worried that Fox News had become too soft, too invested in Republican Party successes and not enough in conservative priorities.\n\nNow OANN is hoping it can make Trump its own powerful ally, as Giuliani was for Fox years ago \u2014 and make Fox the adversary that CNN was for Murdoch.\n\nThough Fox News transformed to become more Trump-friendly after the election, OANN outmaneuvered it: From the day Trump launched his campaign, the network has been aggressively pro-Trump, and Trump has rewarded it in kind, tweeting about it 34 times in the past four years \u2014 far less than he has about Fox, but quite a lot for a relatively unknown cable outlet. By 2019, his support had become so apparent that mainstream news outlets began referring to OANN as \u201cTrump\u2019s new favorite network.\u201d\n\nOANN prides itself on lavishing the president with praise. Last year, it ran the documentary \u201cTrump@War,\u201d directed by former presidential adviser Steve Bannon, which, the ad copy boasted, \u201chighlights the challenges faced by President Trump and his supporters with political adversaries and the mainstream media as the President fights to fulfill his campaign promises to the American people.\u201d The network\u2019s anchors frame stories in language that could have been penned by Trump himself, introducing packages with lines like: \u201cThe president keeps another promise, slashing regulations to a historic low.\u201d Coverage is rife with the conspiracy theories that circulate widely in Trumpland, from accusations that the Obama administration spied on Trump\u2019s campaign to stories that Muslim immigrants have caused a spike in crime in Britain.\n\nThe idea of a network that\u2019s Trumpier than Fox isn\u2019t new: In the last few months of the 2016 campaign, when it seemed likely that Trump would lose, rumors began burbling about Trump TV \u2014 a new network that would carry not just the conservative message but the Trump message. It had a brief preview: Tomi Lahren, who had gotten her start on OANN in 2014, appeared on a Facebook Live feed of \u201cTrump TV\u201d in October 2016 \u2014 a shot across the bow of Fox News lest it consider a more moderate direction in the wake of a failed Trump campaign.\n\nTrump, of course, wound up with other demands on his time after the election, so the rumored launch never happened. And OANN on its own hasn\u2019t unseated Fox News. But the impeachment inquiry creates genuine dangers for Fox: Already, fissures are developing between those who report and those who opine. The new Fox News polls have intensified this by making clear how shaky the president\u2019s position is. OANN does not have this baggage and increasingly runs anti-Fox stories alongside its pro-Trump ones (a recent piece positioned Fox as the \u201cNever-Trump network\u201d \u2014 a sign that OANN, previously reluctant to go after Fox, has fewer qualms).\n\n[Five myths about cable news]\n\nFox News hasn\u2019t lost its position in Trumpworld. There have been no high-profile defections to OANN; Sean Hannity still advises the president; the heavily watched evening opinion lineup is still all-in for the White House. In many ways, OANN \u2014 which is carried on cable and satellite systems that reach about 35 million households, far fewer than the 96 million that Fox reaches \u2014 is less a threat than a cudgel, a way for Trump to show his displeasure and keep Fox in line.\n\nBut OANN is the clearest challenge to Fox yet, because it puts pressure on the network to change its coverage and offers a viable alternative if Fox News does stop supporting him. If it\u2019s not exactly breathing down Fox\u2019s neck, it could still be the MSNBC to Fox\u2019s CNN: In March, it boasted that it was the \u201cfourth rated cable news network,\u201d a bid for mainstream status (though those figures come from ComScore, not Nielsen ratings, because OANN is not counted by Nielsen). Should Fox continue to disappoint the president, OANN has an opening \u2014 and soon Trump\u2019s new favorite network could become Trump voters\u2019 favorite, too.\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nTrump wants to make the media \u2018fair.\u2019 He\u2019s not the first GOP president to try it.\n\nHow the right became addicted to conspiracies\n\nSean Hannity isn\u2019t a leader.
