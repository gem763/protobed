Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured.\u201d\n\nEven as Trump declared success in Syria, U.S. policy appeared to be in disarray. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper was in the Iraqi capital to discuss the redeployment of hundreds of U.S. troops, after Iraq\u2019s military announced its opposition to allowing American forces to stay in the country.\n\nAnd at a Senate hearing Tuesday, James Jeffrey, the administration\u2019s special envoy for Syria, was upbraided by lawmakers, who dismissed his insistence that U.S. goals in Syria \u2014 to prevent an Islamic State resurgence, to remove Assad\u2019s Iranian allies from the country, and to establish a working democracy in the country \u2014 remained intact.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome, such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), noted reports of Islamic State prisoners escaping from \u00adKurdish-run prisons in Syria and the potential for militants to seize Syrian oil fields.\n\nOthers, such as Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), said the Trump administration\u2019s claim of victory was off the mark.\n\n\u201cI have the greatest respect for you,\u201d Menendez told Jeffrey, \u201cbut one can try to put lipstick on a pig but it\u2019s still a pig. One can try to call capitulation a victory, and it\u2019s still capitulation.\u201d\n\nKareem Fahim, Karen DeYoung and Erin Cunningham contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "In a tweet earlier Wednesday, he described the events along the Turkey-Syria border as a \u201cbig success.\u201d", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cBTQIXGqKW1CqXIl_FYQgAcmLOc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NYXJOYXVUYI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
