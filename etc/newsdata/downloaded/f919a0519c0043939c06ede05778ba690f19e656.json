On Bakkt, trading volume for its Bitcoin monthly futures almost hit 350 BTC today. The indicator might exceed the 1,000 threshold by the end of the day.\n\nInstitutional Investors Use Bakkt to Buy Cheap\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to understand the precise reasons behind the BTC flash crash, institutional investors are in a hurry to buy the cryptocurrency at the discount price.\n\nWe just reported that the largest cryptocurrency by market cap had tumbled over $500 or nearly 9% over the day after a surprising flash crash.\n\nAbout two hours before the crash, Twitter user Bakkt Volume Bot said that the trading volume was 8 BTC at the time. It anticipated a total of 58 BTC till the end of the day.\n\n\u2219 Today's volume so far: 8 BTC\n\n\u2219 Last traded price: $7,982.50\n\n\u2219 Trading day progress: 14%\n\n\u2219 Today's forecast: 58 BTC \u2014 Bakkt Volume Bot (@BakktBot) October 23, 2019\n\nHowever, the flash crash raised investors\u2019 appetite so much that the volume on Bakkt exceeded the daily forecast by about five times in less than two hours. Thus, shortly after the drop in Bitcoin price, Bakkt Volume Bot announced that the daily volume reached 296 BTC at the time, forecasting a crazy figure of 1139 BTC.\n\n\u2219 Today's volume so far: 296 BTC\n\n\u2219 Last traded price: $7,772.50\n\n\u2219 Trading day progress: 26%\n\n\u2219 Today's forecast: 1139 BTC \u2014 Bakkt Volume Bot (@BakktBot) October 23, 2019\n\nAt the time of writing, the official site of Bakkt is displaying a total volume of 348 BTC.\n\nThis is already a record since the daily all-time high was 224 BTC, reached on October 9. For example, yesterday, the trading volume on Bakkt was 85 BTC, up 77% from Monday.\n\nVolume Surges Everywhere\n\nNaturally, the trading volume has jumped on other crypto exchanges as well. However, while Bakkt volume increases thanks to buyers, other exchanges might have been in a different situation, as they have to liquidate long positions. On BitMex, long positions worth about $200 million have been liquidated during the last 6 hours. Elsewhere, liquidated shorts were worth an invisible $43,000 for the same period.\n\nThe reason behind these huge liquidations of long positions is that traders were taken by surprise by the Bitcoin flash crash.\n\nDo you think the recent bitcoin drop has something to do with whales?
