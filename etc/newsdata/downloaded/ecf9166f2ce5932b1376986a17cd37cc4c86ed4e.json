Dr Dombard's team believe a nuclear-powered tunnelling probe is the best option for this mission to explore it\n\nThe bot would sample ice throughout the shell, water towards the core as well as water at the ice-water interface, and would look at the underside of the ice to search for microbial biofilms.\n\nThe bot would also have the capability of searching liquid water 'lakes' within the ice shell.\n\nThe researchers considered two designs for their bot: one powered by a small nuclear reactor, and the other powered by General Purpose Heat Source bricks\u2014radioactive heat source modules designed for space missions.\n\nHeat from both these sources could be used to melt the ice shell and communication with Earth would be made possible by a string of 'repeaters' connected to the bot by fibre optic cables.", "description": "Dr Dombard and his colleagues presented a possible solution to this problem at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington, DC, this week.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/17/19/7537658-0-image-a-2_1545075566024.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-17"}
