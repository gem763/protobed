Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her plans to impose a wealth tax if she\u2019s elected president.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not victims; you\u2019re the richest people in the world,\u201d Novogratz said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cHow in God\u2019s name do you feel like a victim?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insanity,\u201d he said. \u201d\u2018They\u2019re going to come and get us.\u2019 No! You\u2019re going to get taxed a little more. Lighten up!\u201d\n\nNovogratz, who is now invested in cryptocurrency, said it makes sense to tax the wealthy to help those who are struggling in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe way the country is functioning today, the bottom 60% aren\u2019t doing well,\u201d Novogratz noted. Warren is \u201cspeaking to that group. She wants to redistribute.\u201d\n\nHe said that 97% of the \u201cpeople in my world are really, really fearful of her.\u201d\n\nThey \u201cdon\u2019t like her, they\u2019re worried about her, they think she\u2019s anti-rich,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a little carried away.\u201d\n\nNovogratz said he\u2019d prefer a more \u201ccentrist\u201d Democratic candidate but isn\u2019t yet convinced anyone else can win. He called Warren a \u201cgood politician\u201d as well as \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cwitty.\u201d", "description": "\"You're the richest people in the world.
