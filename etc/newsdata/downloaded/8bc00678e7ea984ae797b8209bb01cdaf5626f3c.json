Why?", "language": "en", "text": "If you purchased a new car in the last couple years, it\u2019s most likely the safest car you\u2019ve ever owned. Features like backup cameras, collision alerts and lane-departure warnings are helping keep drivers safe, and the data proves this; in a new report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 36,560 people were killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes in the U.S. in 2018. While that sounds like a lot, it\u2019s the continuation of a \u201cgeneral downward trend\u201d over the past 40 years.\n\nHowever, there is one alarming outlier in the report: it was the deadliest year for pedestrians and cyclists since 1990, as The New York Times notes. Seatbelt use is up. Drunken driving is down. Groundbreaking safety tech is here. But despite all that, 6,283 pedestrians and 857 bicyclists were killed, a 3.4% and 6.3% increase compared to 2017, respectively. \u201cOn average, about 17 pedestrians and two cyclists were killed each day in crashes,\u201d writes the Times. But why is this happening?\n\nFour words: Distracted driving and SUVs.\n\n\u201cSome experts said that as Americans continue to purchase larger S.U.V.s and trucks, they may be making themselves safer at the expense of pedestrians and cyclists, who may not be as visible to them as they are to car drivers and would suffer more from a heavier impact,\u201d writes the Times. In other words, not only are SUVs and trucks a secondary threat to humanity because of their disproportionate greenhouse gas emissions, they\u2019re also a direct threat to pedestrians.\n\nAs for distracted driving, the Times says that \u201c10 percent of fatal crashes involve a distracted driver,\u201d and while there is a popular narrative that distracted pedestrians are to blame too, that\u2019s not been backed up by research yet. But while there isn\u2019t a simple way to deal with the SUV and truck problem, distracted driving laws have been implemented or at least considered across the country.\n\nThere are other factors in play as well, including a disproportionate increase in pedestrian and cyclist fatalities in urban areas when compared to population growth (same goes for rural areas, but not nearly as much), as well as pedestrians in low-income communities facing a greater threat.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no clear path forward, and the solution won\u2019t come with just one new program or law. But we\u2019ve spent years increasing safety within cars \u2014 now we need to pay the same attention to people outside them.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The New York Times", "description": "Pedestrians and cyclists were killed in motor vehicle crashes at an alarming rate in 2018, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration", "authors": ["Alex Lauer"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pedestrian_hero.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
