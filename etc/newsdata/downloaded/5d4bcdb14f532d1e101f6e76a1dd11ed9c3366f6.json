He will face a disciplinary panel and it is probable that Francis will be banned for a number weeks which would rule him out of England's last two pool matches against Argentina and France.\n\nArgentina\n\nThe Pumas made a four changes from the loss against France for their second match against Tonga. Fly-half Benjamin Urdapilleta, winger Santiago Carreras, hooker Julian Montoya and number eight Tomas Lezana all were named as starters by coach Mario Ledesma.\n\nEstablished starter Nicolas Sanchez and former captain Augustin Creevy will both be trying to force their way back into the starting side to face England.\n\nThe Argentina squad is currently healthy with no major injury concerns.\n\nWhat is the head to head record between the two teams?\n\nStory continues\n\nEngland and Argentina have met on 23 occasions, with England coming out on the winning side 18 times. Argentina have won on four meetings with the first fixture between the sides in 1981 ending with a draw.\n\nEngland last played the Pumas in November 2017, winning 21-8 at Twickenham.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nEngland attack coach Scott Wisemantal:\n\n\u201c[Argentina will pose] a huge challenge. They carry a lot of threats and that reflects what they have done with their systems with the Jaguares in Super Rugby and also their Argentina B team which plays regularly as well.\n\n\u201cThey have a good system and play a lot of rugby. You have your spiritual leaders like Agustin Creevy, but you also have guys who can really open a game up like Emiliano Boffelli at full back \u2013 a very good player.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of experience and [Nicolas] Sanchez knows who to move his team around the field. You also have Tomas Cubelli at half back. They are a really good team.\u201d\n\nArgentina head coach Mario Ledesma following their loss to France:\n\n\"The message hasn't changed, not just from this staff, but from any the Pumas have ever had. The key thing in wearing the Pumas' shirt is to do your best. Nobody can take it for granted. Everyone who's worn this shirt knows it. That's the name of the game.\"\n\n\"Our mindset (is) very ambitious, perhaps, but we must do what we set out to do.\n\n\"Against France, we didn't in the first 40 minutes, so we must remain focused and overcome our mistakes. The most dangerous teams are the ones who aren't afraid to make mistakes.\"\n\nWhat are the betting odds?\n\nEngland to win: 1/5\n\nArgentina to win: 4/1\n\nDraw: 22/1\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nEngland look the stronger of the two sides and know that a victory against Argentina will put them through into the quarter-finals. The Pumas were impressive in the second half against France but struggled in the early stages. If England's pack can assert dominance with its power game then victory should follow.\n\nPredicted score: England 24 Argentina 15", "description": "England vs Argentina in both sides third match of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
