We all want that second income from you (sic) mobile.\u2019\n\nShe also turned the comments off so people couldn\u2019t call out her ad like they did when she recently plugged a (fan-labelled \u2018dangerous\u2019) cosmetic surgery package.\n\nKerry Katona posts naked photo of herself on Instagram\u2026 twice (Picture: @kerrykatona7 / Instagram)\n\nKerry Katona recently made headlines when she sided with Piers Morgan and mocked Sam Smith\u2019s non-binary identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September Sam confirmed that they would now be using \u2018they\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 pronouns to describe their gender non-binary identity.\n\nThe 27-year-old singer posted a photo with the words \u2018my pronouns are they/them\u2019 but in response, Kerry has now shared her own views, writing: \u2018In a debate about gender identity, Piers cheekily said he how identities as a penguin. I get what he\u2019s saying.\u2019\n\nShe went on: \u2018Look at Sam Smith who has come out as non-binary. Piers blames Sam for the Brits axing its male/female categories.\u2019\n\n\u2018Listen, I love Sam but biologically the singer\u2019s a male. There\u2019s still a penis there! It\u2019s science!\u2019 she added.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
