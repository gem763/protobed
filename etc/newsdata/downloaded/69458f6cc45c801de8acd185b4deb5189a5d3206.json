But keep banks open, as is the case in Rotherham, and towns and local businesses can thrive.\n\nA few days ago, the new boss of the Payment Systems Regulator, Chris Hemsley, stressed the need for all communities to continue to have ready access to cash. Refreshing words. He would be wise to adopt our manifesto that calls for every town to have a bank (stand alone or shared), post office and free to use cash machine.\n\nFewer ghost towns, more buzzing communities, are the order of the day.\n\nFewer ghost towns, more buzzing communities, are the order of the day, says Jeff Prestridge\n\nWoodford saga\n\nTomorrow, investment trust Woodford Patient Capital will announce its results for the first half of the year. For investors in this beleaguered fund that invests in embryonic companies, there will not be a scintilla of good news to give them cause for optimism. Sorry.\n\nAs we have consistently reported in recent months, the stock market listed trust \u2013 a shadow of its former self \u2013 is currently going nowhere under the management of Neil Woodford, a busted star.\n\nIts shares closed on Friday at a tad over 43p \u2013 compared to 100p at the trust\u2019s launch in April 2015 \u2013 valuing it at a shade over \u00a3400million, and bad news remains in the ascendency.\n\nThree days ago, the trust confirmed that the value of yet more holdings \u2013 three unnamed businesses \u2013 had been written down by the fund\u2019s administrators. More write-downs are likely in the weeks ahead.\n\nWith the trust recently demoted from the FTSE 250 Index \u2013 and the whiff of controversy still hanging in the air from Neil Woodford\u2019s controversial decision to sell 1.75million personal shares in Patient Capital without first informing members of the board \u2013 it is surely time for decisive action.\n\nOn Monday, investment trust Woodford Patient Capital will announce its results\n\nThat can only come from the boardroom whose members are paid to protect the interests of shareholders (little sign of \u2018protection\u2019 so far).\n\nIn late July, the board confirmed that it was looking to replace Woodford, but there has been not a trace of white smoke confirming the appointment of new managers.\n\nMaybe tomorrow\u2019s results will shine a little light on how the board is progressing with this key work \u2013 they remained stum on Friday when pressed by The Mail on Sunday. I do hope so because the current situation at Patient Capital is untenable.\n\nAny more dragging of feet by the trust\u2019s board and they will quite rightly be in the dock for failing in their duties to investors. Time, not patience, is of the essence.\n\nJust to complete the sorrowful Woodford jigsaw, dealings in fund Equity Income remain suspended while sister vehicle Income Focus continues to shrink in size as investors sell up.\n\nOver the last year, Woodford investors have suffered paper losses of 24 per cent (Income Focus), 31 per cent (Equity Income) and 48 per cent (Patient Capital).\n\nEnough to make you weep into your Sunday bowl of shredded wheat, but strangely not sufficiently cataclysmic to arouse the interest of the Financial Conduct Authority.
