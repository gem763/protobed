Now she\u2019s 21 and has decided that the alterations she had made to her body through chemicals haven\u2019t made her any better.\n\n\u201cRuby\u201d is now de-transitioning to fully embrace her female body and instead work on her mental issues. Sadly, she confessed that there has been virtually zero support for this decision within her community.\n\nBut according to Sky News, the community is out there. In fact, a former transgendered person, Charlie Evans, came across a community of 5,000 people who wished to de-transition back into their normal selves.\n\nIn fact, Evans noticed a pattern.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in communication with 19 and 20-year-olds who have had full gender reassignment surgery who wish they hadn\u2019t, and their dysphoria hasn\u2019t been relieved, they don\u2019t feel better for it,\u201d said Evans, \u201dI think some of the common characteristics are that they tend to be around their mid-20s, they\u2019re mostly female and mostly same-sex attracted, and often autistic as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what their options are now,\u201d she added.\n\nEvans has now started the \u201cThe Detransition Advocacy Network\u201d to support people like herself and Ruby.\n\nWhile this is considered to be new news by the mainstream media, the truth is that it\u2019s something that has been happening for some time.\n\nA year ago, I reported that scientific research had been attempted at trying to see what the repercussions were of transition surgeries after one surgeon who specialized in these things had become overwhelmed with requests from post-op transgendered individuals to put them back to the way they were before the surgeries.\n\nA researcher named James Caspian approached a University to get funding for these studies, and after being approved, he found his approval quickly revoked as the ethics board of the University faced backlash by the transgender activist community.\n\n(READ: Scientists Can\u2019t Research Surge In Regrets Over Transgender Surgeries Due To Fears Of Backlash From LGBT Community)\n\nSince this report was released last year, one can only fathom how many people have come to the same conclusion as Ruby, yet no one is allowed to talk about it in an official capacity over fears of social and political backlash. This is tragic when you think about all the people who are being hurt by the lie that cutting your body up will make you feel so much better.\n\nAs has been seen repeatedly by researchers, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nHaving gender dysphoria already carries with it an abnormally high suicide rate that increases 19 times after transition surgeries.\n\nResearch needs to be done and these people need to find help, not more lies.", "description": "Thousands Who Underwent Transition Surgery for Their Gender Dysphoria Now Want Reversals", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Nick Arama", "Mike Ford", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/obama-transgender-girls-locker-room.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
