That would help Mr Erdo\u011fan fulfill domestic political pledges to reduce the number of Syrians in Turkey.\n\nIt also has the strategic benefit of creating a buffer zone of Syrian Arabs in between the Kurds of northeast Syria and the Kurds of southeast Turkey.\n\nTurkey says it will provide public services in areas it occupies but many fear that Kurdish populations in Syria will be displaced and the area will be unable to support so many refugees.", "description": "What will the Turkish offensive look like?", "authors": ["Raf Sanchez", "Middle East Correspondent", "William Hague", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/17/TELEMMGLPICT000208831007-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
