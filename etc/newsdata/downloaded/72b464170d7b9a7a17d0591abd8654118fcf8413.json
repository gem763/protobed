Everyone is getting angry now.\u201d\n\nStockton beach in New South Wales is being washed away by dramatic coastal erosion which has already claimed a childcare centre, and the community is now demanding emergency action from the state government.\n\nThe childcare centre, supporting 72 children, was forced to permanently close on 3 September and the Stockton Surf Life Saving Club \u2013 once a 150-metre run for Noel Burns across the sand from the waves \u2013 now has water regularly crashing at its rock wall.\n\nHolding back the tides: Sydney's battle against coastal erosion | Wendy Harmer Read more\n\nIn June last year, erosion exposed a dump site containing asbestos that made its way onto the sands. There have also been temporary closures of cabins at a caravan park, although they have been reopened.\n\nSurf competitions that used to be held at the front of the surf club are now relocating several kilometres away.\n\nA GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $16,000 since it was launched a week ago. Last Sunday, more than 500 residents attended a rally at a safe end of the beach, which now has only one safe access point. Locals say the erosion has been getting worse over the past 20 years.\n\nThe NSW local government minister, Shelley Hancock, has vowed to visit the community \u201cin the coming days\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stockton beach is being washed away by dramatic coastal erosion, forcing people out of buildings close to the shoreline. Photograph: Supplied\n\nCallan Nickerson, the president of the 112-year-old Stockton Surf Life Saving Club, said the beach was the heart and soul of the community.\n\n\u201cPeople used to come home from work and kick off their shoes and get straight down there to put their feet in the water. Now they\u2019re just going down to see how much sand we\u2019ve lost that day. It\u2019s sad and it\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\nNickerson said the NSW government and Newcastle city council had known about the extensive erosion issues \u201csince the 1980s\u201d but there had been a lack of meaningful action.\n\nHe said erosion had been happening in Stockton \u201cfor at least 100 years\u201d as a result of two manmade break walls constructed as part of the port of Newcastle works.\n\n\u201cWhen essential services are being affected it should send a clear message to the state government that it is now time to act,\u201d he said.\n\nStockton Community Action Group has sought legal advice from the New South Wales Environmental Defenders\u2019 Office.\n\nSimon Jones, a group member and surfer, said the group wanted to know if they could move sand from a nearby bank about 1,000 metres offshore to replace the 10 million cubic metres he said had been lost.\n\nIt\u2019s like bashing your head against a sea wall Tim Crakanthorp\n\n\u201cWe feel [the government] should be taking a much more proactive approach. It\u2019s just heartbreaking. As a kid I took the beach for granted, but I\u2019ve watched it deteriorate before my eyes.\u201d\n\nThe state MP for Newcastle, Tim Crakanthorp, accused the government of inaction, saying he had raised the issue \u201cmore than 50 times\u201d in parliament.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s like bashing your head against a sea wall. This community is being washed away while the government buries its head in the sand.\u201d\n\nLucas Gresham, a Stockton real estate agent who is organising the crowdfunding campaign, said the money would be used to fund any legal case.\n\n\u201cWe need immediate sand nourishment \u2013 that\u2019s going to help the community while we come up with an end result,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city of Newcastle has carried out emergency works in recent weeks using large one-tonne sandbags while repairing a sea wall. The council has said the surf club, a local cafe and a car park \u201care safe for the long term\u201d.\n\nAssociate professor David Kennedy, a coastal geomorphologist at the University of Melbourne, says what\u2019s happening in Stockton is a \u201cclassic case\u201d where human development has interfered with the natural movement of sand along coastlines.\n\nHe said it was fair for the residents to blame the construction of walls, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve interrupted the along-shore transport and, essentially, just blocked the flow of sand.\u201d\n\nAround Australia, he said, \u201cwe are seeing more and more cases like Stockton.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe developments we\u2019ve been doing have reduced beaches\u2019 natural resilience,\u201d he said.\n\nHonorary professor Andrew Short, of the University of Sydney, has visited every beach in Australia to study coastal systems. He says for hundreds of years Stockton has been losing sand to dunes to the north and this, together with the building of walls perpendicular to the coast, meant Stockton\u2019s beach was being starved of sand.\n\nHe said many of Australia\u2019s known hotspots for hazardous erosion had been created because as towns grew, buildings and infrastructure were built too close to the shore at a time when \u201cthey really didn\u2019t know much better\u201d.\n\nA UN climate report on Thursday predicted that by 2015, the world would be experiencing a sharp increase in the number of extreme events caused by sea level rise.\n\nExtreme sea level events \u2018will hit once a year by 2050\u2019 Read more\n\nClimate change, said Short, was \u201ccertainly going to exacerbate any problems that we\u2019ve already got\u201d.\n\nHancock, the local government minister who has responsibility for coastal management issues, told Guardian Australia she would visit Stockton beach to meet residents and council officials \u201cin the coming days\u201d.\n\nShe said the state government was working with the city of Newcastle to \u201cdevelop solutions to manage the region\u2019s coastline\u201d.\n\nThe NSW government has given Newcastle city council more than $1.2m for tackling \u201cissues across the region\u2019s coastline\u201d, she said, as well as support through numerous studies and reports aimed at finding solutions.\n\nHancock added she had asked the department of planning, industry and environment to speak to the council to help it apply for assistance through an $83m government fund, and she had also asked for deadlines for applications to be extended by two weeks.", "description": "After a century of damage from manmade sea walls, climate change is threatening the future of Stockton beach", "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7424d665bc26fe1a690c765dcfea635ae0b8a486/84_0_1697_1018/master/1697.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc83bdecd5a8f17b107ec9e2e1a3ccad", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
