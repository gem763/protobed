It\u2019s not the case that you can subcontract out the devastation of 5% of the world\u2019s global energy supply and think that you can absolve yourself from responsibility. Were it the case that the Houthis\u2019 fraudulent claim was accurate, were that true \u2014 it\u2019s not, but were that true, it doesn\u2019t change the fingerprints of the Ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply.\"\n\nPompeo said the intelligence community has high confidence that the Houthis did not possess weapons systems like the ones used in the attacks. He said that they believe the attacks originated in Iran, not in Iraq.\n\n\"As for how we know, the equipment used is unknown to be in the Houthi arsenal,\u201d he said. \u201cThese line attack cruise missiles we have never seen there and we think we\u2019ve seen most everything. So the intelligence community has high confidence that these were not weapons that would have been in the possession of the Houthis. That\u2019s probably the most important piece of information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also know that these are systems that the Iranians have not deployed anyplace else, that they have not deployed outside of their country to the best of our knowledge. We\u2019ve not seen them deploy these types of UAV systems with the kinds of ranges and capabilities nor have we seen them place these missiles where they could have done it. We\u2019ve seen no evidence that it came from Iraq. It could have well have traveled over Kuwait \u2014 we\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve not seen that,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nHe also called the Houthis liars and suggested they do not operate independently from Tehran.\n\n\u201cWhenever you report about them, and you say, \u2018The Houthis said,\u2019 you should say \u2018The well known frequently lying Houthis have said the following.\u2019 This is important because you ought not report them as if these truth-tellers, as if these are people who aren\u2019t completely under the boot of the Iranians and who would not, at the direction of the Iranians, lay claim to attacks that they did not engage in. Which clearly was the case here,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cSo there you go, whenever you say Houthis, you should begin with, \u2018the well-known, frequently known to lie Houthis,\u2019 and then you can write whatever it is they say. And that\u2019d be good reporting (laughter) and I know you care deeply about that good reporting.\u201d", "description": "President Trump said he's ordered new sanctions on Iran after this weekend's attacks on Saudi oil facilities.
