Caspering is all about being a nice human being with common decency. A novel idea.\n\nCatfish: Someone who uses a fake identity to lure dates online.\n\nClearing: Clearing season happens in January. It\u2019s when we\u2019re so miserable thanks to Christmas being over, the cold weather, and general seasonal dreariness, that we will hook up with anyone just so we don\u2019t feel completely unattractive. You might bang an ex, or give that creepy guy who you don\u2019t really fancy a chance, or put up with truly awful sex just so you can feel human touch. It\u2019s a tough time. Stay strong.\n\nCloutlighting: Cloutlighting is the combo of gaslighting and chasing social media clout. Someone will bait the person they\u2019re dating on camera with the intention of getting them upset or angry, or making them look stupid, then share the video for everyone to laugh at.\n\nCuffing season: The chilly autumn and winter months when you are struck by a desire to be coupled up, or cuffed.\n\nFiredooring: Being firedoored is when the access is entirely on one side, so you're always waiting for them to call or text and your efforts are shot down.\n\nFishing: When someone will send out messages to a bunch of people to see who\u2019d be interested in hooking up, wait to see who responds, then take their pick of who they want to get with. It\u2019s called fishing because the fisher loads up on bait, waits for one fish to bite, then ignores all the others.\n\nFlashpanner: Someone who\u2019s addicted to that warm, fuzzy, and exciting start bit of a relationship, but can\u2019t handle the hard bits that might come after \u2013 such as having to make a firm commitment, or meeting their parents, or posting an Instagram photo with them captioned as \u2018this one\u2019.\n\nFreckling: Freckling is when someone pops into your dating life when the weather\u2019s nice\u2026 and then vanishes once it\u2019s a little chillier.\n\nGatsbying: To post a video, picture or selfie to public social media purely for a love interest to see it.\n\nGhosting: Cutting off all communication without explanation.\n\nGrande-ing: Being grateful, rather than resentful, for your exes, just like Ariana Grande.\n\nHatfishing: When someone who looks better when wearing a hat has pics on their dating profile that exclusively show them wearing hats.\n\nKittenfishing: Using images that are of you, but are flattering to a point that it might be deceptive. So using really old or heavily edited photos, for example. Kittenfishes can also wildly exaggerate their height, age, interests, or accomplishments.\n\nLovebombing: Showering someone with attention, gifts, gestures of affection, and promises for your future relationship, only to distract them from your not-so-great bits. In extreme cases this can form the basis for an abusive relationship.\n\nMicrocheating: Cheating without physically crossing the line. So stuff like emotional cheating, sexting, confiding in someone other than your partner, that sort of thing.\n\nMountaineering: Reaching for people who might be out of your league, or reaching for the absolute top of the mountain.\n\nObligaswiping: The act of endlessly swiping on dating apps and flirt-chatting away with no legitimate intention of meeting up, so you can tell yourself you're doing *something* to put yourself out there.\n\nOrbiting: The act of watching someone's Instagram stories or liking their tweets or generally staying in their 'orbit' after a breakup.\n\nPaperclipping: When someone sporadically pops up to remind you of their existence, to prevent you from ever fully moving on.\n\nPreating: Pre-cheating - laying the groundwork and putting out feelers for cheating, by sending flirty messages or getting closer to a work crush.\n\nProwling: Going hot and cold when it comes to expressing romantic interest.\n\nR-bombing: Not responding to your messages but reading them all, so you see the 'delivered' and 'read' signs and feel like throwing your phone across the room.\n\nScroogeing: Dumping someone right before Christmas so you don't have to buy them a present.\n\nShadowing: Posing with a hot friend in all your dating app photos, knowing people will assume you're the attractive one and will be too polite to ask.\n\nShaveducking: Feeling deeply confused over whether you're really attracted to a person or if they just have great facial hair.\n\nSneating:When you go on dates just for a free meal.\n\nStashing: The act of hiding someone you're dating from your friends, family, and social media.\n\nSubmarineing: When someone ghosts, then suddenly returns and acts like nothing happened.\n\nV-lationshipping:When someone you used to date reappears just around Valentine's Day, usually out of loneliness and desperation.\n\nYou-turning: Falling head over heels for someone, only to suddenly change your mind and dip.\n\nZombieing: Ghosting then returning from the dead. Different from submarineing because at least a zombie will acknowledge their distance.", "description": "You're more likely to be successful on eharmony if you're a woman who posts bikini pictures or a man showing a photo of him with a dog or a baby.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dumped-for-an-insta-model-cd16_1571262128.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
