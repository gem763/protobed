Carell was on the show to promote his upcoming Apple TV+ series The Morning Show, but thankfully for comedy fans, the bulk of their conversation was good old-fashioned reminiscing about their days spent performing together at Second City, then The Dana Carvey Show, and then Jon Stewart\u2019s The Daily Show (\u201cEven Stevphen\u201d forever!). Special attention is paid to the Dana Carvey Show sketch called \u201cWaiters Who Are Nauseated by Food,\u201d in which their fake-puking talents were so impressive that it led to them getting hired for their next gigs at Comedy Central. If you haven\u2019t seen it, you really should \u2014 and if you\u2019re familiar, you know it\u2019s always worth a revisit:\n\nThey also revisited a 2001 Daily Show segment they did together called \u201cDrink Responsibly,\u201d in which Colbert guided Carell through a long night of getting absolutely wasted (or as Colbert called it at the time, \u201cstunned as a bag of hammers\u201d). This example also involves puking \u2014 only this time it was 100 percent real and inside Colbert\u2019s car:\n\nRemember, kids: Don\u2019t try fake puking or extreme drinking like this at home. Leave it to the professionals.", "description": "On CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d old friends Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell looked back on their days performing together at Second City, \u201cThe Dana Carvey Show,\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Vomit is a recurring theme.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/25/25-steve-carrell.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
