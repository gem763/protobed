Businesses suffered. This demonstrates that government did not learn a thing back in 2008.\n\nBy now, South Africa should have developed or tightened the immigration laws such that there is a decisive mechanism to deal with the problem of foreign nationals.\n\nThe undocumented number of foreign nationals in the country and the illegal methods they use to enter South Africa is depressing.\n\nUnless government develops tight and strict security laws our leaders will continue to explain themselves to their counterparts whenever the country is burning.\n\nFortunately, the leaders have done enough public relations to quell the tempers among South Africans.\n\nThe next bold step to take would be to fast-track policies to deal with the undocumented migrants and how they get to South African.\n\nMost of these people do not come through the borders.\n\nI am reminded of an incident in 2001 while employed as a journalist at this newspaper.\n\nI interviewed Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, then minister of home affairs and director general, Billy Masetlha.\n\nThey had gone to the Musina border post in Limpopo to see for themselves the security measures there and, importantly, to deal with the illegal entries.\n\nThen labour minister Membathisi Mdladlana had also gone to inspect farmworkers and their conditions in the northern part of the country when he was confronted with the problem.\n\nBoth Buthelezi and Mdladlana, in front of television cameras and newspaper journalists, expressed disgust and promised to activate their Cabinet colleagues to do something stringent about the situation.\n\nToday, 18 years later, the same problem still persists. It does not look like there is an urgent resolution to the impasse.\n\nThere are different schools of thought among South Africans.\n\nSome believe the foreign nationals are responsible for the trafficking of drugs which young children then get hooked on.\n\nThey also blame them for human trafficking. High schools in the country are overrun by drug dealers.\n\nLast week, Police Minister Bheki Cele released the worrying crime statistics which shows an increase in crime.\n\nAlthough Cele did not provide any nexus with the current developments, the situation, however, cannot be read in isolation.\n\nSouth Africans did not wake up one day and found that the foreign nationals were the problem.\n\nThat is based on a culmination of daily living experiences and conditions. But again, there is a problem of crime, generally.\n\nSome people take full advantage of the situation and hide behind the foreign nationals to perpetuate their criminal activities.\n\nPeople take advantage to loot shops, rob others of their hard earned money and commit other crimes in the name of fighting xenophobia.\n\nIt is for this reason that the law must deal with these people.\n\nThese developments place a heavy burden on the government in so far as providing essential services.\n\nThe public hospitals, low-cost houses and social grants are currently under the microscope, as they are seemingly being exploited by foreign nationals.\n\nWhile acknowledging the role played by other African countries and, of course, the international communities during the dark days of apartheid, the situation is now different.\n\nSouth Africa has immigration laws, social stability, public order, better housing and healthcare facilities that need to be respected.\n\nNo foreign national must disrespect this country by causing disorder which, unfortunately, they cannot cause in their countries of origin given the strict and tight crime fighting measures back home.\n\n.
