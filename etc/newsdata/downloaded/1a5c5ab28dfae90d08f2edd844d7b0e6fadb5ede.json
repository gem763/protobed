He was second in the conference in scoring averaging 23.1 points. Seton Hall received one more vote than the Wildcats on Thursday.\n\nVillanova has won five of the past six regular-season titles and topped Seton Hall by two points in the conference tournament title game in March.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just tight in the predictions for just the top two teams. Only seven points separated third through seventh place.\n\nXavier was third, with Marquette and Providence tied for fourth. Georgetown, Creighton, Butler, St. John\u2019s and DePaul round out the poll.\n\nVillanova forward Jeremiah Robinson-Earl has been tabbed as the conference\u2019s freshman of the year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Seton Hall edged Villanova atop the Big East preseason conference poll, ending the Wildcats' five-year run as favorites.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
