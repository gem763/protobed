Halloween baking fails will make you howl with laughter rather than scream in terror", "language": "en", "text": "With Halloween just over a week away, baking enthusiasts have been trying their hand at making spooky-themed cakes - with disastrous results.\n\nAmateur bakers from across the world took to social media to show off some of their worst cake fails - and they'll instantly make you feel better about your last recipe disaster.\n\nShared on the Facebook shaming group Well, That's Certainly A Cake Wreck, the treats range from a ghastly misshapen ghost to a very suspicious-looking pumpkin.\n\nHere, FEMAIL picks out a selection of the best ghoulish delights that are more likely to leave you howling with laughter than screaming in terror...\n\nGhoulish delight: This ghastly misshapen ghost cake was among the bakes posted to Facebook shaming group Well, That's Certainly A Cake Wreck. It is not known where the image was taken\n\nOne anonymous woman's attempt at a Marshmallow Web Ghost Cake turned into a 'horrifying mess' that left several social media users in stitches. The location of this photograph is unclear\n\nWhile this pumpkin-themed cake supposedly tasted just fine, the piping left a lot to be desired. The location of this photograph is unclear\n\nIs it a wall of spiders? Is it a ghost? Who knows. But the cake, at an undisclosed location, definitely wouldn't impress Paul Hollywood or Prue Leith\n\nThis cake is definitely frightening but probably not for the reasons intended. Social media users accused the unidentified brain cake of looking decidedly ugly and unappetising\n\nThis cake, from an unidentified area, is certainly scary but for internet users it's only because it's been so badly decorated\n\nFull marks for effort, but this Pennywise cake, based on the character from Stephen King's 1986 horror novel It, provokes shock for all the wrong reasons\n\nWanting to depict Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street horror film series, this cake fell slightly flat with Facebook users from all over the world feeling it just wasn't scary enough\n\nFor cake-lovers, this sweet treat failed to offer the perfect ghostly shape and the message was somewhat indecipherable. The location of this image is unknown\n\nIt isn't just cake that's being shamed in the run-up to Halloween, as these poorly decorated spooky biscuits were also shared on the Facebook group by an anonymous member", "description": "Amateur bakers from across the world took to social media to show off some of their worst Halloween-themed cake fails and they'll instantly make you feel better about your last recipe disaster.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/18/20047248-0-image-a-322_1571764840908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
