Graham: Trump admits everything\n\nBut it is also because the cover-up suggests a recognition of guilt. Aides who listened to or heard about the call quickly realized that it represented a gravely inappropriate abuse of his office and very possibly a crime. By all accounts, they moved quickly to try to shield him from his own errors of judgment. This was not an especially honorable, principled, or patriotic move, but it was a gesture of loyalty.\n\nNo one has accused one key person of being part of the cover-up: Trump himself. While his aides tried to hide his behavior, the president himself has been fairly forthcoming. As I wrote on Monday, even before the transcript or whistle-blower report was public, Trump had admitted to pressuring Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. (Since then, he has made the semantic argument that he was not pressuring Zelensky, without changing his story materially.) He has said he wanted Ukraine to investigate corruption, and he has insisted that what he was doing was a proper exercise of his prerogatives in setting American foreign policy. Trump ordered the release of the transcript of his call, over the apparent objections of several of his aides, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThese aides were more clear-eyed about how serious Trump\u2019s misconduct was than the president, but their cover-up has proved disastrous. It\u2019s like a twisted version of O. Henry\u2019s \u201cThe Gift of the Magi.\u201d The aides saw the misconduct, but not the political risk, while Trump didn\u2019t see what he\u2019d done wrong, but had a more acute political sense that a cover-up demonstrates awareness of guilt, even to reporters who are loath to draw conclusions about the substance of Trump\u2019s behavior on its own.\n\nIf his aides were right on the law, Trump might have had the better argument politically. This is hardly the first time Trump has misbehaved egregiously, and while it\u2019s simpler to understand than, say, the various strands of the Mueller report, it\u2019s no simpler than the Access Hollywood tape or hush-money payoffs to porn actresses. The president recognizes that when he brazens out a scandal, acknowledging the basic facts but insisting he did nothing wrong and attacking his opponents, he has been able to survive.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to imagine a counterfactual history of this incident in which Trump talks with Zelensky and records of the call are disseminated as usual. In this scenario, someone leaks the call to the press, which asks Trump about it. He answers\u2014as he did Monday\u2014that of course he did it. After all, he\u2019d made no bones about his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, going around trying to dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. Why would he deny it now? Perhaps Trump\u2019s blunt admission of the facts combined with a denial he did nothing wrong would have defused this case, just as it had others.", "description": "The president\u2019s aides were trying to protect him, but in the process made clear they thought his behavior was problematic.", "authors": ["David A.
