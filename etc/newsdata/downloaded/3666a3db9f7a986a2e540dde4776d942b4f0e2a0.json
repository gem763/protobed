And in the first week there was already 50 different nationalities, so it went pretty quick. So now we must be around 80 different nationalities, there's really people from all over the world.\n\n\"We're getting great feedback because it's a different cuisine and people think of waffles as something sweet. They're very astonished when they try it.\"\n\nWhile over at Frites Atelier, three Michelin-starred Dutch chef Sergio Herman is busily dusting frites with olive powder and basil. While the chip in Belgium could never be described as humble, here it is getting a luxury upgrade.\n\nThe restaurant chain was established in the Netherlands in 2016 by Herman, to elevate frites to the next level. he began with a search for the perfect potato. After a year and a half of research and testing, Herman found his match in the Agria, a variety common in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nThe next task was to fine-tuning the frying. All Frites Atelier potatoes are steamed, pre-fried and then fried in vegetable oil.\n\nThe toppings on offer include carbonnade flammande (a beef stew marinated in beer), parmigiano with olive powder and basil, and Catalan cream with spicy ketchup, aioli, and lemon zest. Customers can also top up their fries with freshly made sauces including truffle, b\u00e9arnaise or harissa.", "description": "Two-starred chef Yves Mattagne is swapping waffle toppings from strawberries and cream to lobster and foie gras, while three-starred Sergio Herman is dusting frites with olive powder and basil.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/07/02/1000x563_cmsv2_c9d51c1b-449b-5a34-9014-f145e36512d6-4230702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
