I certainly feel for Bundee, he's pretty devastated that any further participation in the tournament is now at risk.'\n\nDespite the sending off, Ireland ran out comfortable 47-5 victors over Samoa in Fukuoka\n\nWith Aki having Samoan heritage, the night was supposed to be special for the New Zealand-born centre as he mixed with friends on the Samoa team.\n\nSamoa were almost as distraught as the Irish over Aki's red card and coach Steve Jackson said they would willingly make representations to help the 29-year-old escape further sanction.\n\n'As (Samoa captain) Jack (Lam) said, I hope no further sanction goes on,' said Jackson, who lost two players to red cards through the course of the tournament.\n\n'I've known Bundee for a long, long time, he's a great man with great character.\n\n'Hopefully the powers that be see some sense and he gets to continue on in the tournament because he's a great kid.'\n\nIreland dominated the line-out and scored at ease against a defensively-vulnerable Samoa\n\nAlthough down to 14 men early in the match, Ireland responded well and ended up running in seven tries as Samoa crumbled with indiscipline and shoddy defence.\n\nSchmidt said he was pleased with how Ireland managed to starve the Samoans of possession and controlled the game by playing to their strengths in the scrum and the maul.\n\nThey will face champions New Zealand or South Africa in the quarter-finals, depending on the outcome of the Scotland-Japan game on Sunday which may yet be cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.\n\n'The second half probably wasn't great to watch but it was comforting to know we were in the right side of the pitch,' said Schmidt.\n\n'I felt that tactically we were relatively solid once we lost Bundee.'", "description": "Bundee Aki was sent off in the 29th minute after a high tackle at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium and faces a multiple-game suspension, souring the win that put Ireland through to the quarters.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/17/19629794-0-image-a-118_1570896017341.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
