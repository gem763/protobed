The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity as the information isn\u2019t public.\n\nDealflow involving oil and gas exploration and production companies has slumped this year to its lowest level in a decade, excluding the large acquisition by Occidental Petroleum Corp of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.\n\nThe slowdown comes as shareholders, unhappy with years of substandard returns from their investments in oil and gas, have pushed companies to eschew growth and focus on developing existing positions, and cost cutting - all aimed at boosting the amount of cash given back to investors.\n\nThis has left investment bankers tasked with advising on such transactions without sufficient work.\n\nJefferies has one of the largest energy investment banking teams in the United States, meaning the layoffs reflected a small percentage of its overall energy investment banking team, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe bank ranks second and third in league tables for oil and gas M&A transactions by volume and value, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nEarlier this month, Wells Fargo & Co laid off 13 people, or 7% of its energy investment bank in Houston - a story first reported by Bloomberg News.", "description": "Jefferies Financial Group has laid off 15 people in its energy investment banking team, as the bank reacts to a slowdown of mergers and acquisitions activity among oil and gas companies, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.", "authors": ["Gary Mcwilliams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
