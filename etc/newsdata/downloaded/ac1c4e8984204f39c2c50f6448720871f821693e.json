I know a lot of guys just want to leave.\u201d\n\nEDUARDO JACOBO, AN AGENT IN CALIFORNIA\u2019S EL CENTRO SECTOR:\n\nThe difference between doing the job now and when I started is like night and day. Before, it was a rush of adrenaline when you caught people with drugs. You were doing more police stuff. Now it\u2019s humanitarian work. If you ask anybody about being in Border Patrol, they\u2019re playing a movie scene in their head, jumping into a burning building and saving people. Now, it means taking care of kids and giving them baby formula.\n\nBy and large, the agency has been a willing enforcer of the Trump administration\u2019s harshest immigration policies. In videos released last year, Border Patrol agents could be seen destroying water jugs left in a section of the Arizona desert where large numbers of migrants have been found dead.\n\nSome of those who worked at the agency in earlier years said that it had changed over the past decade, and that an attitude of contempt toward migrants \u2014 the view that they are opportunists who brought on their own troubles and are undeserving of a warm welcome \u2014 is now the rule, not the exception.\n\n\u201cThe intense criticism that is being directed at the Border Patrol is necessary and important because I do think that there\u2019s a culture of cruelty or callousness,\u201d said Francisco Cant\u00fa, a former agent who is the author of \u201cThe Line Becomes a River,\u201d a memoir about his time in the agency from 2008 to 2012. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of oversight. There is a lot of impunity.\u201d\n\nThe Border Patrol was established in 1924. Early agents were recruited from the Texas Rangers and local sheriff\u2019s offices. They focused largely on Prohibition-era whiskey bootleggers, often supplying their own horses and saddles. Though horseback units still exist, the culture of the agency bears little resemblance to its past.\n\nIt has become a sprawling arm of Customs and Border Protection, the country\u2019s largest federal law enforcement agency, which is responsible for 7,000 miles of America\u2019s northern and southern borders, 95,000 miles of shoreline and 328 ports of entry. On a practical level, the Border Patrol\u2019s hubs along the Mexican border, known as sectors, operate in some ways as fiefs.\n\nIn border cities, sector chiefs become household names, delivering annual State of the Border speeches. In the 1990s, an El Paso sector chief, Silvestre Reyes, used his popularity to win a seat in Congress.", "description": "Overwhelmed by desperate migrants and criticized for mistreating the people in their care, many agents have grown defensive, insular and bitter.", "authors": ["Manny Fernandez", "Caitlin Dickerson", "Miriam Jordan", "Zolan Kanno-Youngs", "Kendrick Brinson", "Photographs By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/12/us/00borderpatrol-01/merlin_157824042_40c4e4d7-2091-410c-a450-4b67844c0487-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
