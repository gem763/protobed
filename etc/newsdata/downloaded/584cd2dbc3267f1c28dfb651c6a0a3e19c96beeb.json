And bringing National Grid back under state control would be part of plans to create a National Energy Agency to help usher in Labour's proposed Green Industrial Revolution.\n\nInvestor confidence 'severely hit'\n\nThe CBI's report estimated there could be a 10.7% increase in debt from bringing industries back into public ownership.\n\nThis would raise debt levels to 94% of GDP, the highest point since the 1960s, and would cost about \u00a32bn a year, according to the study.\n\nIt also said that under Labour's plans, savers and pensioners could suffer an estimated \u00a39bn loss to their holdings, which translates into \u00a3327 for every household in the country.\n\nThe CBI bases its analysis on the nationalisation of:\n\nNine water and sewerage companies and seven water-only companies in England\n\nNational Grid, and the electricity transmission and distribution networks\n\nRail rolling stock\n\nRoyal Mail\n\nThe report said the confidence of international investors in the UK would be \"severely hit\" if Labour refused to pay full market value for the industries.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Labour has said nationalisation of energy infrastructure would help create a green revolution\n\nAlthough the analysis said that the state-owned assets would increase in value and there would be potential revenues generated, the study's focus was on costs rather than estimates of potential benefits.\n\nRain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, called the price tag \"eye-watering\". And she said that \u00a3196bn was only the starting point.\n\n\"It doesn't take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle-down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country's public finances.\n\nFair economy\n\n\"There are so many other genuine priorities for public spending right now, from investing in our young people to the transition to low carbon economy and connecting our cities and communities.\n\n\"These issues are what keep businesses up at night and what they want to see the government get on with addressing. Nationalisation would waste time, energy and public money.\"\n\nA Labour spokesman said the CBI was more interested in protecting shareholders than in creating a fair economy. He accused the organisation of \"incoherent scaremongering\".\n\nThe spokesman said: \"It is disappointing that the CBI seems incapable of having a grown-up conversation about public ownership - which is hugely popular, and common across Europe. It sadly reveals that they are more interested in protecting shareholders than in creating a fair economy.\"\n\nLast week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, suggested that focusing on the upfront cost of Labour's plans was the wrong approach. \"Economically what matters is whether these assets would be better managed by the public or the private sector,\" it said.", "description": "The CBI employers' group claims Labour's plans would cost the combined health and education budgets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E1A3/production/_103536775_685fce8b-fe56-49a9-848d-db44ead5de3d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
