It has never had its equivalent of the Prague spring, or Ukraine\u2019s Euromaidan. But the four years since the Law and Justice party (PiS) came to power have been marked by public demonstrations \u2013 from nationalist commemorations of independence day and Catholic-run \u201cmarches for life and family\u201d to LGBT rights parades, pro-choice protests and the Campaign to Defend Democracy\u2019s [KOD] fight against the government\u2019s perceived weakening of the constitution.\n\nSunday\u2019s parliamentary election can be viewed as a test of the relative success of these different campaigns. Despite polling that suggests Law and Justice will secure the best results of any single party in the post-1989 period, there is much to suggest the country is increasingly divided.\n\nFamily, faith, flag: the religious right and the battle for Poland\u2019s soul Read more\n\nLaw and Justice\u2019s platform is to provide a strong Catholic moral foundation to a programme of social benefits, and it has clearly paid off over the past four years. As the messages from the party and its allies in the media and clergy become ever stronger in tone, it runs a greater risk of alienating more moderate voters.\n\nWith figures such as the party president, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, reminding us that his party exclusively recognises families as \u201cone man, one woman and children\u201d, it is clearly not aiming to soften its rhetoric yet. But then, it has never pretended to be a party that works for everyone: instead it has identified a specific base of supporters and cornered their vote through smart, if occasionally cynical, campaigning and largely delivering on electoral pledges. Schemes such as the 500 Plus child benefit package, offering 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a3103) each month for every child after the family\u2019s first, have genuinely improved the lives of people in parts of the country that previous Polish governments had stopped even paying lip service to, and have begun to more evenly distribute the country\u2019s growing wealth for the first time since EU accession in 2004.\n\nFor the last four years, Civic Platform (PO) \u2013 the mainstream opposition party, which governed between 2007 and 2015 \u2013 has had a clear strategy for re-election. It has poured its energy into attacking Law and Justice\u2019s judicial and constitutional reforms, leading the Campaign to Defend Democracy in order to underline the supposed dangers of these changes. Yet that approach has had little success beyond PO\u2019s natural base. Cabinet ministers and pro-government outlets have pointed out, quite accurately, that actions such as appointing sympathetic judges are perfectly in keeping with the behaviour of every previous government. The opposition\u2019s subsequent campaigning has similarly failed to win much support: it has preferred to point out the government\u2019s faults, rather than underlining what it would do to improve the country if given the chance.\n\nLaw and Justice, for its part, seems happy to campaign on LGBT issues. Just as the 2015 election was marked by strong rhetoric against the EU\u2019s refugee quotas for individual countries \u2013 and indeed, Law and Justice later limited Poland\u2019s resettlement obligation to just 150, mostly Christian, Syrians \u2013 the government\u2019s determination to promote the family values of the Christian right has encouraged deeper divisions between liberal and conservative-minded people. Some local councils have declared \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d, which have no real legal implications but have received explicit support from various government figures, and it is hard to escape the sense that many on Poland\u2019s right feel that some citizens just don\u2019t fit into the society they are building.\n\nBy contrast, a great deal of energy and positivity has been generated by the resurgent left, following campaigns by both the women\u2019s rights movement against a tightening of abortion laws and, more recently, the LGBT equality marches. A new party, Spring (Wiosna), has made its name through its tireless campaigning for LGBT rights. It serves as a front for the likable (if slightly bland) Robert Biedro\u0144, Poland\u2019s first openly gay politician, who rose to prominence as the popular mayor of the small northern city of S\u0142upsk. The party\u2019s work deserves respect in a country where far-right Christian terrorists were recently arrested for planning bomb attacks on Lublin\u2019s equality march, and where Biedro\u0144 himself has experienced various acts of homophobic violence.\n\nThe most effective electoral campaign on the left, however, has been run by Together (Razem), which was founded four years ago in frustration at the conservatism and complacency of the once-governing Left Democratic Alliance [SLD]. A mixture of seasoned campaigners and younger activists energised by this new wave of protest, Together failed to secure the 5% of votes necessary to have representation in the Sejm (the lower house) in 2015. But it still passed the 3% threshold to receive funding from the state, under Poland\u2019s electoral rules, which it has used to build its platform as the country\u2019s first truly modern centre-left party. Now it has formed an electoral alliance with Spring, as well as the somewhat stagnant SLD. Between Together\u2019s campaigning strength and Biedro\u0144\u2019s charisma, the group is increasingly confident that the left will return to the Sejm after a four-year absence.\n\nNot that Law and Justice will be worried: it seems almost certain it will be returned to government on Sunday. But therein may lie its ultimate downfall. The party\u2019s enormous success risks instilling the same kind of complacency that brought down its opposition four years ago. Nowhere can a party rule democratically for several terms while making enemies of significant blocs of the population. And the number of Poles declaring themselves atheist is steadily rising; anyone who has joined one of those pro-LGBT marches that took place around the country this summer will have noticed just how young its participants were. Large numbers of these marchers won\u2019t be eligible to vote until the elections in 2024, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from campaigning and signalling that the country they will inherit will be more open and welcoming.\n\nPoland is conservative and Catholic, but also queer, atheist, Jewish, progressive, and many things besides. While there are many reasons for the left in this country to be pessimistic, looking beyond the depressing headlines suggests that it is nevertheless taking the very first steps to building a tolerant nation of multitudes.\n\n\u2022 Stefan Bielik is a writer and teacher from Krak\u00f3w", "description": "The Law and Justice party\u2019s conservative anti-LGBT agenda is making enemies of moderate Poles, says writer and teacher Stefan Bielik", "authors": ["Stefan Bielik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d083a2eeb7e34f51861b97e5349a95744745c7d8/0_245_5595_3357/master/5595.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a32ca73ff10925ad016c9ae48ba6f6a6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
