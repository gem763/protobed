The resulting chaos forced a broader pullout of U.S. troops and led the Kurds to turn to President Bashar Assad, their last remaining hope for protection against Turkish-led forces.\n\nTrump has defended his decision, saying it extricates the U.S. from \u201cstupid endless wars\u201d \u2014 a self-fulfilling prophecy as the security vacuum sucks in surrounding powers. The fighting leaves much of northeastern Syria, home to the country\u2019s biggest oil fields, up for grabs.\n\nA look at who is most likely to benefit.\n\nASSAD AND HIS ALLIES\n\nUnder a deal struck between the Kurdish fighters and Assad, he has started deploying his forces in villages and towns near the border with Turkey \u2014 areas his military had abandoned in 2012 at the height of the civil war.\n\nWith the help of Russian airpower and Iran-backed militias, Assad has managed to bring most of Syria back under his control after years of heavy fighting in which his forces besieged and bombarded the opposition into submission. The last remaining rebel stronghold in Idlib province, in the northwest, and the Kurdish-controlled areas were the exception.\n\nAssad has vowed to bring all of Syria back under his control, and he now has powerful leverage over the Syrian Kurds. He and his allies could potentially halt or contain the Turkish offensive but will demand territory in return.\n\nThat could potentially give Assad, and by extension Iran and Russia, control of vast, oil-rich lands bordering Iraq. It would further expand the so-called \u201cShiite crescent\u201d of Iranian influence stretching from Tehran to Lebanon, alarming U.S. allies like Israel , which has strongly condemned the attack on the Kurds.\n\nThe Syrian Kurds themselves, with their project for self-rule in tatters, would return to a reconstituted Syrian state as a marginalized minority, bringing eight years of war and displacement almost full circle.\n\n___\n\nTURKEY AND ITS SYRIAN FIGHTERS\n\nTurkey had initially vowed to carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d extending 30 kilometers (20 miles) into Syria. But after a series of rapid advances left Kurdish forces in disarray and sparked a complete U.S. pullout, it might be tempted to push even deeper into Syria.\n\nTurkey is relying to a large extent on allied Syrian fighters, mainly Arabs and minority Turkmen who despise the Kurds and have been accused of violence and looting. Turkey also says it hopes to resettle up to 2 million of the 3.5 million Syrian refugees it is hosting in the war-won territories. That could upend the demographic balance, laying the foundation for future ethnic conflict.\n\nDespite being a NATO ally, Turkey\u2019s relations with the U.S. have plummeted in recent years and look set to fray further. U.S. officials have sharply condemned the offensive, and Trump has vowed to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it does anything \u201coff limits,\u201d raising the prospect of American sanctions.\n\nThat would force Turkey to strengthen its ties with Iran and Russia, potentially leading to another agreement among the three powers to divide Syria into spheres of influence. Turkey, Iran and Russia \u2014 and not the U.S. \u2014 would have the final word in any future peace agreement.\n\n___\n\nAN ISLAMIC STATE COMEBACK\n\nIS lost its last bit of territory in March, but still stages attacks in Syria and Iraq, and the extremists have a long history of recovering after suffering big military defeats.\n\nThe Syrian Kurds were the most effective ground forces battling IS. Even days before the offensive, they were still partnering with U.S. forces on operations to track down remnants of the group.\n\nNow those operations have ceased, and the Syrian Kurds say they may not be able to maintain control of detention centers across northeastern Syria where they are holding an estimated 10,000 IS militants, including 2,000 foreign fighters, as well as tens of thousands of female IS supporters and their children.\n\nClashes near a holding camp on Sunday allowed hundreds of IS supporters to escape in a prison riot. The hasty U.S. withdrawal, meanwhile, made it unlikely that American forces would complete plans to transfer dozens of the most feared IS fighters to detention facilities in neighboring Iraq.\n\nIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, himself a former detainee held by U.S. forces in Iraq, is still at large, urging his supporters to step up attacks and stage prison breaks.\n\nSyria, Turkey, Iran and Russia all have an interest in preventing an IS resurgence and have battled the extremists before. But over the course of the civil war, they often appeared to view IS as a secondary threat, with Syria and its allies focusing on the opposition and Turkey prioritizing the fight against the Kurds. As the various powers converge on northeastern Syria, IS could slip between the cracks.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joseph Krauss on Twitter at www.twitter.com/josephkrauss .", "description": "The U.S. decision to withdraw from northeastern Syria after paving the way for a Turkish invasion has placed the oil-rich region back in play, heralding a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/facdea_turkey-us-syria-57883-turkish-youth-celebrates-national-flag-news-syrian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
