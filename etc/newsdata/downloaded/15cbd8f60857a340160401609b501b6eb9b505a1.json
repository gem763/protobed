I thought he was going to get a stoppage. It looked like it was three inches wide and two inches deep.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst cut besides the (Vitali) Klitschko and Lennox fight. That was the worst cut I\u2019ve seen in my life.\u201d\n\nWilder then vowed to open up Fury\u2019s cut once again when they rematch next year.\n\n\u201dI can\u2019t wait. I hope they heal well, and I can\u2019t wait to see Mr Fury.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem if he\u2019s ready or not. He signed the contract. That\u2019s his problem. He better get ready. No matter what he does, when he fights me, it [the cut] is going to open right back up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pop it right back open. He can get plastic surgery, duck tape or staples, Super Glu or Hot Glu, Cement Glu. S***, he can go get some of that Flex Glu. It ain\u2019t even going to matter.\u201d", "description": "Deontay Wilder intends to open up Tyson Fury\u2019s\u00a0severe cut\u00a0in order to win their rematch.\u00a0 The Brit suffered a minor crisis in his recent bout with Otto Wallin when a cut developed above his right eye.\u00a0 The Gypsy King weathered the storm though and prevailed on points, despite a doctor looking closely at the damage, which could have handed him a shock defeat.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/06/fury-vs-wallin-38329828.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
