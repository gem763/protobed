After a series of minor procedures, Monique went in for a final surgery with Beale last month.\n\nMoorcroft said: \"I don't know what went wrong because she was fine the whole morning after the surgery, even out of sleep, and just after 16:00 she had difficulty breathing and then she passed away.\"\n\nShe added that no one could tell her what had happened.\n\nThe family is still waiting for a cause of death.\n\nMoorcroft said it was difficult to understand Beale as he apparently does not communicate well.\n\n\"He doesn't talk much, it's like you have to drag things out of him. He doesn't communicate well \u2026 he doesn't speak out and say what's happened so you know and then you're puzzled about what's going on,\" she added.\n\nGross negligence case\n\nIqbal Allie, another parent who lost his child, said his daughter was supposed to go to Beale for a biopsy on her thyroid to examine the tissue.\n\nIt was only a few months down the line when he noticed his daughter becoming \"cretin\" when another doctor pointed out that there was no activity in her thyroid, which Beale had removed, Allie said.\n\nShe is now permanently on growth hormones.\n\nAfter the incident, he and his family sued the state for gross negligence and won.\n\nHe too allegedly had problems dealing with Beale.\n\n\"Initially, he was okay, he was a bit arrogant but he wasn't rude,\" Allie said.\n\n\"He had an arrogancy about himself, he said he was the best endocrinologist or paediatrician in the world. So now I want to ask him which planet was he talking about?\"\n\nAlso read: Three years later but still no answers from the HPCSA on toddler's death\n\nIn reply to News24's questions, Beale's lawyer, Jeanne Albertse, said: \"Prof Beale would like to assure patients that he has always consistently striven to maintain the reasonable standards expected of him as a paediatric surgeon in his medical management of patients and shall continue to do so going forward.\"\n\nMohammedh Sayan, Zayyaan's father, who is freshly grieving the loss of his son, said patients should not be made to feel like doctors were doing them a favour.\n\n\"When you think of a doctor, you couple them with saving lives, you couple them with being compassionate, with having love for children and patients in general.\n\n\"You don't expect them to be rude, arrogant. You don't expect them to think that they are doing you a favour because they're actually not.\n\n\"They're supposed to be doing a service to humanity, especially when they took the oath,\" he said.", "description": "The death of 10-year-old Zayyaan Sayed has stirred a controversy that is centred around paediatric surgeon Dr Peter Beale and anaesthetist Dr Abdulhay Munshi.
