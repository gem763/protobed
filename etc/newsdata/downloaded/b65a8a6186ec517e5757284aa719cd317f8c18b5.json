Plastic comes in all sorts of varieties. It can\u2019t all go together in the same hopper to be recycled.\n\nAD\n\nMany consumers, said Susan Collins of the National Recycling Coalition, don\u2019t understand \u201chow delicate the balance of material in the manufacturing process is and how perfect the material input needs to be in order to make a product that\u2019s of some value.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPlastic carrier bags of the sort you get from a grocery store are made from a different type of resin than a plastic bottle or a yogurt cup.\n\n\u201cThose distinct differences are important because [the items are] used in different ways,\u201d Collins said. \u201cA plastic cup is both brittle and it can hold a form. Meanwhile, you want your carrier bag to be very, very flexible.\u201d\n\nBecause they are born differently and live different lives, bottles and bags are handled differently at the end of their lives. Plastic bags are recyclable (we\u2019ll see how shortly) but the processors who purchase them require them to be perfectly clean, said Adam Ortiz, director of Montgomery County\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen they get mixed into the commingled recycling stream, they get dirty,\u201d Ortiz said. A plastic container, on the other hand, gets shredded, then washed, then processed into pellets and reused.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s why you should never bundle your plastic, glass and metal recycling in a plastic bag and throw it all in a recycling bin.\n\nBut there\u2019s a second, just as important, reason local jurisdictions don\u2019t want plastic bags in with your recycling: They gum up the works.\n\nA transfer station \u2014 the place where the recycling goes to be sorted \u2014 may seem like a big, stinky factory, but it\u2019s actually a complex and delicate machine, crisscrossed with conveyor belts, screens and sorting tables.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPlastic bags and other film-like plastics get caught in the machinery and jam it or are a fire hazard,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cBut people should not lose hope. They can just take clean bags back to the grocery store. All the major grocery retailers have drop-offs, usually right in the front.\u201d\n\nMost chain grocery stores will accept clean carrier bags and newspaper bags for recycling. Collins said you should not include \u201ccrinkly\u201d plastic of the sort that holds prewashed salad.\n\nAD\n\nIt makes sense for the stores to serve as collection points for bags since they distribute so many and also because they handle so much plastic themselves, in the form of the sheeting that enshrouds bulk deliveries.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGrocery stores are already handling that type of film plastic back-of-store,\u201d Collins said.\n\nA spokesperson for Giant said all of the plastic bags that are collected at its stores in the Washington area are put on a trailer and sent to the chain\u2019s own recycling facility, along with cardboard, metal and other recyclable plastics that enter the store with its inventory.\n\nThe plastic bags are placed in a large baler and compressed into bales. The bales are shipped to Winchester, Va., where a miraculous transformation takes place.\n\nThe plastic bags are used by Trex, the company that pioneered \u201cwood-alternative\u201d building materials. The bags are cleaned, ground into granules and added to sawdust from reclaimed wood. That mixture is heated until it\u2019s gooey and then pressed into decking, railings and outdoor furniture. The company says the average 500-square-foot composite Trex deck contains 140,000 recycled plastic bags.\n\nThat means you can be reading the newspaper on a Trex deck, knowing the bag it came in might end up in another deck someday.\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "The wispy bags gum up the works.
