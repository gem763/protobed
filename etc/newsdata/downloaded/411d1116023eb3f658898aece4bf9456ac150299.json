Fellow celebs quickly took notice of Ashley's fit physique with Women's Health cover star Camila Mendes commenting, \"hubba hubba \ud83d\ude0d.\" Georgie May Jagger (Mick Jagger's daughter) also said, \"This body!!!\"\n\nAshley ab's look super sculpted and strong\u2014but they didn't just, ya know, happen. Here's how she stays in such flame-emoji-worthy shape:\n\nAshley's into cardio.\n\nShe shared with Health that she likes to work up a sweat with a solid cardio sesh. \"I usually do Pilates three days a week for an hour, and I try to box or do SoulCycle two or three times a week,\" she said. \"There are times I just want to do nothing! But then I don't feel good about myself.\"\n\nAnd she loves her squats.\n\nThe move she loves to tone her legs? Squats. \"Probably squats\u2014and not for my butt but for my legs. We usually do circuit training, so I'll do 25 squats, then I'll run back and forth, and then I'll do lunges to the other side of the gym both ways, run, then squats. I can't move for days!\" she told Health.\n\nAshley's dogs keep her active.\n\nWith two pups, she's out on walks (because duh). Plus, she told Health that she starts every morning by playing with them. Awwwww.\n\nShe makes sleep a priority.\n\n\"I try to take an hour nap. If I don't get sleep, I found that I get really bad anxiety. I started getting panic attacks for two years straight,\" she told Health.\n\nOh, and Ashley eats pretty healthy, too...\n\nAshley everyday diet? It's totally balanced, as she shared with Delish.\n\nBreakfast: A hard-boiled egg with iced coffee and a splash of half and half\n\nLunch: Salad (or a cheeseburger)\n\nDinner: Fish (\"If I'm trying to be healthy,\" she says. \"Otherwise, probably a cheeseburger.\")\n\n...but she also loves donuts.\n\nIn 2016, she shared with Delish that she is a huge donut fan\u2014specifically, the chocolate cake variety with chocolate frosting. She also wouldn't say no to a chocolate bar donut. \"I have a serious sweet tooth,\" Ashley said.\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram / Ashley Benson More\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Pretty Little Liars alum credits her fit bod to Pilates and boxing.", "authors": ["Emily Shiffer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VUIlT1MKyvPcVp22kF_hUw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/8204797a24c3b1ac539b5e56baa0a816", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
