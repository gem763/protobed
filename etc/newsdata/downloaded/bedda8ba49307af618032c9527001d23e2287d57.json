As we know from 2016, however, disappointing polls don\u2019t necessarily mean sure defeat, but that doesn\u2019t stop the media and others from using them to push their anti-Trump narrative. One recent example is a Wednesday-released Fox News poll, taken October 6 - 8 during the heated national discussed about President Donald Trump\u2019s infamous July 25 phone call to the president of Ukraine. Supposedly, according to this poll, 51 percent \u2013 a slim one, but nevertheless a majority of Americans \u2013 want Trump not only impeached in the House, but convicted in the Senate and removed from office.\n\n\u201cJust over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office,\u201d read the Fox News lede from Wednesday. The 51 percent signified a shocking 9 percent jump from when the \u2018I\u2019 question was last posed in July.\n\nLet that sink in. If this poll is correct, a majority of this country wants to see Trump removed from office for the \u2018high crime and misdemeanor\u2019 (apparently) of asking Ukraine to investigate (not fabricate, but investigate) possible crimes. Though, as stated above, I\u2019m used to and even expect negative polling. My \u2018spidey sense\u2019 started tingling as soon as this one hit and the media narrative started to build. Sure, plenty of Americans don\u2019t like Trump, but if a true majority have been duped by this Ukraine nonsense into thinking NOW is the time to tear this country apart by actually removing a sitting president, we\u2019re farther down the rabbit hole than I ever imagined.\n\nSomething had to be amiss. And indeed, something WAS amiss, as the Trump campaign was quick to point out. Turns out, Fox News made the same seeming mistake the vast majority of pollsters regularly make - they included significantly more Democrats than Republicans in their sample.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to get 51 percent in favor of impeachment when nearly half of those polled were Democrats,\u201d a Trump campaign official told the Daily Caller in a Thursday statement. \u201cThe media should put this poll where it belongs \u2013 in the garbage.\u201d\n\nI concur, and here\u2019s why:\n\nIn fact, 48 percent, or nearly half, of the Fox News poll\u2019s 1,003 respondents self identified as Democrats. Republicans came in at 40 percent, an eight percent decrease, with the other 12 percent being Independents.\n\nFirst of all, are there really 8 percentage points separating Republicans from Democrats in this country? The answer is, not even close. According to Gallop\u2019s last analysis, 31 percent of Americans identify as Democrats, 29 percent as Republicans, and the rest - a whopping 38 percent - actually identify as Independents. So the question to Fox News on their latest polling data isn\u2019t merely why fewer Republicans were polled than Democrats, but also why were Independents almost criminally underrepresented?\n\nConsider, of the around 120 Independents who WERE included in the poll, only 39 percent support actually removing Trump from office, versus 47 percent who do not and 14 percent who don\u2019t know. If the sampling of Independents were closer to the true national representation, would we have a number that even approaches a national majority supporting the president\u2019s removal?\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if this poll and others like it are meant to create, not measure, public opinion. Oddly, it\u2019s not like the pollsters, at least at Fox News, aren\u2019t capable of being more even-handed. The January poll comprised 41 percent Democrats, 39 percent Republicans, and 20 percent Independent. The network\u2019s July polling sample, the last one with a question about impeachment, included 46 percent Democrats and 15 percent Independents, a 5 percent shift that, while still leaning heavily Democratic and under representing Independents, might have failed to, you know, shift the freaking national narrative to that of a MAJORITY of Americans supposedly supporting removing the president from office.\n\nFinally, the question itself is troubling, at least in my opinion. The actual question on impeachment reads this way: \"Do you think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, or not?\"\n\nWhat if you support an official impeachment inquiry, as many Republicans do, which would allow them subpoena power to mount a defense of the president as well as dig into the various Democratic scandals? What if you want to teach Trump a \u2018lesson\u2019 of sorts by having the House impeach, but don\u2019t want him convicted in the Senate and removed because, maybe, you respect the will of the electorate in 2016? There is no room for any of those variances in the poll, only whether you want him \u201cimpeached and removed from office.\u201d Those are two separate issues!\n\nIf a poll is going to cover the impeachment topic, it should include the following questions:\n\n\u201cDo you support an official impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you believe the House should vote to impeach President Trump?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the House votes to impeach, do you think two-thirds of the Senate should vote to convict and remove President Trump from office for high crimes and misdemeanors?\u201d\n\nThose questions, and an even-handed representation of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, would have almost certainly resulted in a whole other narrative than what we received last week.", "description": "Trump supporters should brace themselves for a LOT of disappointing .10/14/2019 1:15:37AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/94ef4db4-8ee4-40a4-981c-ff548bdaceb4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
