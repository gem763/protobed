Faintly visible in the background of the image were the words \u201cGuys we are going to kill her in the vote later but do not say.\u201d The tweet has since been deleted.\n\nHowever, other MEPs said substantive issues played a big part in the decision.\n\n\"This is not just a political game, there have been some serious questions about her integrity, some serious questions about her portfolio,\" said Christel Schaldemose, coordinator for the internal market committee for the center-left Socialists & Democrats group.\n\n\"I don't know what will happen now, Macron will have to find a new person but at the same time, it would be wise if Ursula von der Leyen considers the broad portfolio, because it has been \u2014 and it's fair \u2014 part of the discussion,\" Schaldemose said.\n\nIn a brief reaction, Goulard tweeted that she \"took note of the decision of the European Parliament, with respect for democracy.\" She thanked Macron and von der Leyen, and the MEPs who voted for her.\n\nOne MEP from the same liberal-centrist group as Goulard described the defeat as a \u201chumiliation\u201d for Macron.\n\nMarcel Kolaja, a Czech MEP from the Greens group, said the second confirmation hearing on Thursday had been \"a fair chance to clarify on a lot of stuff, on policy, and also the ethical aspects\u201d of Goulard\u2019s candidacy.\n\nBut, he said, \"MEPs were not satisfied with the answers, in particular on the ethical parts.\" Goulard \"was not able for instance to clarify what the added value of \u20ac10,000 per month was,\" Kolaja added, referring to the amount Goulard was reportedly paid by the Berggruen Institute, a U.S.-based think tank.\n\nThe rejection of Goulard, who was supported by the liberal-centrist Renew Europe group, means one nominee backed by each of the three biggest political blocs in the Parliament has failed to win confirmation. Romania's Rovana Plumb, supported by the Socialists & Democrats, and Hungary's L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, who had the backing of the EPP, were rejected by the Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee.\n\n\"I regret that Sylvie Goulard was not confirmed. This shows that merit does not always triumph over politics,\" said Dita Charanzov\u00e1, a Parliament vice president and coordinator for Renew Europe in the internal market committee.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "MEPs vote down Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s nominee for beefed-up internal market job.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174947253-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
