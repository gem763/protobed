Instead of a dark, gritty origin story of yet another comic-book figure, Phillips has now decided to set his sights on a character who has long lived and struggled on a particularly famous, rough street: Oscar the Grouch. Harbour \u2014 who, according to writer Mikey Day, came up with the concept for the sketch \u2014 stars as Grouch\u2019s titular character, and the trailer teases out appearances from other Sesame Street regulars like Big Bird (Heidi Gardner), the Count (Beck Bennett), Elmo (Melissa Villase\u00f1or), Bert and Ernie (Mikey Day and Alex Moffat), and Snuffleupagus (Kenan Thompson), who is now Prairie Dawn\u2019s (Chloe Fineman) pimp. It\u2019s absolutely twisted \u2014 and you\u2019ll never hear the Sesame Street theme song the same way again after watching it.\n\nRelated", "description": "On NBC\u2019s \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 host David Harbour stars as \u2018Sesame Street\u2019s Oscar the Grouch in a \u2018Joker\u2019 parody trailer of a gritty origin film for the children\u2019s show star.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/snl-david-harbour-grouch.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
