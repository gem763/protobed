This movement proved to be highly bullish for the aggregated crypto markets, as multiple major altcoins posted notable gains.\n\nAnalysts are now noting that BTC currently has a bullish market structure but are also noting that it may first need to dip back towards $8,300 before it is able to gain enough upwards momentum to propel it towards $9,000.\n\nBitcoin Rally Stalls; Will It Extend Further?\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up over 3% at its current price of $8,485, which marks a notable climb from its daily lows of $8,200.\n\nIt is important to note that the upper-$8,300 level was previously Bitcoin\u2019s near-term resistance, and its break above this level opened the gates for significantly further gains. Despite this, BTC\u2019s bulls have not yet been able to step up and push the crypto\u2019s price higher, which is leading some investors to question the long-term significance of this rally.\n\nPopular cryptocurrency analyst HornHairs, however, explained in a recent tweet that Bitcoin\u2019s 2-day candle chart shows a bullish market structure break that could mean it will test its near-term resistance level in the upper-$8,000 region, which will be a price that is critical for bears who want to prolong BTC\u2019s recent downtrend to defend.\n\n\u201c$BTC #Bitcoin: 2D chart just landed a bullish market structure break.
