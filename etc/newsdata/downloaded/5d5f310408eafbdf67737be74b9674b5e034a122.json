But in 2014 began a battle, one for supremacy to be acknowledged as the best batsman in Test cricket. It started when India toured Australia in 2014-15. Steve Smith started piling up the runs and a rejuvinated Virat Kohli scored 4 hundreds in 8 innings. Yes, the war was on. And since then till now, it has always been up for debate on who is better.\n\nSmith's numbers are clearly better and his tendency to rack up the big scores has given him a disadvantage. But the real battle has been about the top spot in the ICC Rankings. Since Smith took it for the first time and Kohli dethroned him, it's been a game of cat and mouse with one trying to overtake the other.\n\nCricinfo\n\nNow Smith had a clear lead till 2018, when the cruel hand of fate intervened. Due to his role in the ball-tapering scandal, Smith was banned for one year. Kohli used this period to his advantage as he scored with a lot of consistency. By the time Smith was back, Kohli had taken the No. 1 spot with ease. But if you thought it was all over, well, you were wrong.\n\nSmith was a run-machine in the recently concluded Ashes series. As the series drew to a close, the No. 1 rank was back with the Aussie with Kohli not too far behind at No. 2. Kohli bridged the gap considerably after an epic 254 not out vs South Africa in India's latest Test. The difference is marginal and truth be told, there is not much to choose from between the two.\n\nDon't Miss 254 SHARES 489 SHARES 949 SHARES 274 SHARES\n\nKohli will turn 31 next month and Smith just turned 30 in June. Both of them have a good 5-6 years minimum left in the game so expect this battle to continue for some time to come. Yes, the likes of Joe Root and Kane Williamson might also get thrown into the mix, but these two pretty much rule the roost. Barring some real batting talent surfacing in the next couple of years or so, it will be the Kohli and Smith show until one or both of them retire. When that does happen, cricket will be poorer for it.\n\nBut that will happen when it happens, we shall cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, let us enjoy them fight for the top spot. Kohli can take it back, and if he does he knows he cannot relax because Smith will we right behind him.", "description": "Steve Smith made his debut in 2010, Virat Kohli made his in 2011.
