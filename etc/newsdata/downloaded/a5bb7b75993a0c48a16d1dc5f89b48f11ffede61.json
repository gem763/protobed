Barring anything unusual happening, the president\u2019s Electoral College victory could easily surpass his 2016 win over Democrat Hillary Clinton, which came by a 304-227 count,\u201d writes CNBC finance editor Jeff Cox in his analysis of the Moody prediction.\n\nThat prediction also reveals a U.S. map graphic which has a lot of strategic bright red on it. The prediction also finds Mr. Trump winning in 35 states, including such key locales as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIf the economy a year from now is the same as it is today, or roughly so, then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump\u2019s election odds are very good, particularly if Democrats aren\u2019t enthusiastic and don\u2019t get out to vote. It\u2019s about turnout,\u201d observes Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nIt\u2019s all about pocketbooks too. When the organization measured how people feel about their personal finances and applied their findings, things were very rosy indeed. In that particular scenario, Mr. Trump would win 351 electoral votes to the generic Democratic candidate\u2019s 187 votes.\n\n\u201cMoody\u2019s based its projections on how consumers feel about their own financial situation, the gains the stock market has achieved during Trump\u2019s tenure and the prospects for unemployment, which has fallen to a 50-year low. Should those variables hold up, the president looks set to get another four-year term. The modeling has been highly accurate going back to the 1980 election, missing only once,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Mr. Cox explains.\n\nPOWERFUL GRASSROOTS\n\nA word to the many critics of who complain about \u201cbig money\u201d in elections: President Trump\u2019s campaign raised $125.7 million in the third quarter of the year, with a total of $158 million cash on hand.\n\nThe campaign also reports that there were 1,056,126 individual donations received this quarter \u2014 of which 98% were $200 or less. The average donation, they say, was $44.50.\n\nBETO\u2019S FUTURE\n\nOne talk show host has an apt forecast for the future of Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke following his performance in the fourth Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Beto\u2019s doing other than running for MSNBC host. Coming up, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get a good hour,\u201d predicts Meghan McCain, a host on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nThere could be something to that. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has a huge cache of personal videos on his own YouTube channel, and also made his mark earlier this year by livestreaming his visit to a dentist, an encounter that went on for over three minutes and included a discussion about immigration policy and life on the southern U.S. border with his hygienist.\n\nTHE WILE E. COYOTE STRATEGY\n\nThere are some who believe that the impeachment \u201cinquiry\u201d is a circus. And there are other who say it\u2019s a cartoon.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have become the party of Wile E. Coyote \u2014 super genius. If you are a member of Generation X or older, you undoubtedly remember the Warner Brothers cartoons featuring a hapless coyote, chasing a road runner who always outpaces him. Today, we\u2019re seeing this scenario play out in real life, in the endless and absurd pursuit of President Trump by the Democrats and their dedicated supporters in the media,\u201d writes Townhall columnist Mike LaChance.\n\n\u201cThis comparison goes far beyond casual observation. In these cartoons, the methods the coyote uses in his attempts to catch the road runner become more and more ridiculous, to the point where it is no longer clear how the scheme will even advance the ultimate goal of catching the road runner,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cIn the same way, Democrats and their allies in media continually raise the bar, never pausing to consider the appearance of their approach. Every time they think they can finally \u2018get\u2019 Trump, they end up at the bottom of a canyon with a massive boulder directly overhead,\u201d the columnist notes.\n\n\u201cLike Wile E. Coyote, Democrats and the media will continue to create more elaborate schemes which will serve only to showcase their fall off a cliff. The coyote is a cartoon character. His ludicrous stupidity is meant to make us laugh. What is their excuse?\u201d he asks.\n\nDEMOCRATIC DEBATES, \u2018TOXIC CULTURE\u2019\n\nA feminist advocacy group in now demanding that the Democratic National Committee cancel the next presidential debate, to be hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post on Nov. 20.\n\nUltraViolet Action, an outspoken women\u2019s advocacy group with 1.2 million members, is troubled by the \u201ctoxic culture\u201d at NBC following new revelations of sexual misconduct at the network revealed in a new book by investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.\n\n\u201cThe DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,\u201d says Shaunna Thomas, founder of the organization.\n\n\u201cClean house and do an independent investigation,\u201d she advised the broadcasters in a follow-up tweet.\n\n\u201cThese initial reports demonstrate that NBC\u2019s current leadership is either unable or unwilling to take appropriate steps to combat the culture of sexual abuse at the networks. These are problems that can only be solved by significant structural and cultural changes at MSNBC, NBC News, and its parent company, Comcast,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.\n\n\u201cThe DNC must stand with survivors and pull the upcoming Democratic presidential primary debate from MSNBC until Comcast takes clear steps to clean house at NBC News,\u201d she added.\n\nSo far, there has been no reaction from either the DNC, the TV network or the Post.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 87% of Americans have some form of health insurance; 94% of Republicans, 82% of independents and 91% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 76% overall say they like their health coverage; 78% of Republicans, 75% of independents and 77% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 53% get their coverage from their employer or union; 54% of Republicans, 55% of independents and 48% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 25% overall rely on Medicare; 28% of Republicans, 20% of independents and 28% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 6% self-insure with an insurance company; 5% of Republicans, 7% of independents and 5% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 4% are on Obamacare; 1% of Republicans, 5% of independents and 5% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A CBS News poll of 1,292 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 26-Oct. 2 and released Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
