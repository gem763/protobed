All by themselves.\n\nRELATED:\n\nEp 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nDo The Block contestants get bargain tradies?\n\nOf course, Keith still doesn\u2019t know that real estate agent Jesse is actually a qualified tiler. It\u2019s a fact that the notorious big noter has managed to keep close to his chest throughout the gruelling TV renovation.\n\nThe outspoken duo\u2019s efforts wowed judges Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer who described Jesse and Mel\u2019s courtyard as \u201cexpensive-looking\u201d.\n\nAnd we all know how much Jesse loves the word \u201cexpensive\u201d.\n\nTheir victory came as no surprise to Jesse who proudly declared he comes to every judging expecting to win.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a magazine,\u201d he said of his own courtyard, without the slightest hint of false modesty.\n\n\u201cForm and function, it is hands down the best courtyard on The Block.\u201d\n\nJesse and Mel\u2019s win takes them another step closer to winning The Block altogether. It also takes the top prize further and further away from the grasp of Mat and El\u2019ise, Tess and Luke and Andy and Deb.\n\nCurrently, only Jesse and Mel and Mitch and Mark have enough funds to see the entire property renovation through.\n\nAnd that is causing tensions within the group.\n\nWhile Matt and El\u2019ise, Tess and Luke and Andy and Deb are facing the very real possibility that they won\u2019t have enough money to finish the full renovation, Mitch and Mark are gleefully plotting to put a potentially game-winning spa bath on their top deck.\n\nBut to get their spa across the line they need the support of at least three teams. Jesse and Mel have already made it clear that they will oppose the idea because they don\u2019t want to give Mitch and Mark any kind of advantage in what is shaping to become a two-horse race.\n\nThe spa plan opened old wounds for El\u2019ise who has never quite gotten over the fact she won\u2019t able to afford to put a pool in at her place. Mitch and Mark were gobsmacked by her OTT reaction to their plans. Let\u2019s just say, if the boys get their spa approved, they will be able to fill it with El\u2019ise tears over the injustice of it all.\n\nHowever, gripped with fear she will be yet again the bad guy, El\u2019ise quickly set about trying to convince the nicest person on the show, Deb, to do her dirty work instead.\n\nPoor ever-smiling Deb. She hates to ruffle feathers. If you recall, she ended up comforting El\u2019ise when she extorted $5000 from Deb and Andy to secure her support for them having an upstairs terrace.\n\nBack then, Mitch and Mark needed no such cash incentive to back Andy and Deb and Tess\u2019s desire for upstairs terraces. They were also quick to put El\u2019ise in her place for demanding the pay-off. And so, they foolishly thought what goes around comes around, and that the two couples would help them take the plunge with the spa.\n\nOf course, that was back when everyone still believed they had a fighting chance at winning. Now, while Jesse is the only one willing to voice it openly, nobody is eager to give the boys any more of a winning edge than they already have.\n\nSo, the three cash-strapped couples have asked for some time to discuss the matter with their real estate agents.\n\nAnd that has really got Mitch and Mark in a tizz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just surprising because when we were in a very similar position, we basically said we will back you. We have your back. It now shows that their loyalty is flawed,\u201d Mitch spit, with a look of thunder on his face.\n\nThe equally clearly peeved Mark makes their position clear, warning the others that if they don\u2019t get their votes then it will be no more Mr Nice Guys for the final five weeks.\n\nThat ultimatum hit Tess and Luke hard.\n\nThey are already fearful that The Block may have been a complete waste of their time to the extent that a tearful and frustrated Tess has told her husband, after the courtyard judging, that it may be time to down tools and head home to Cairns.\n\nNow that would be a Block first!\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEp 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEp 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEp 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEp 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEp 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEp 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEp 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEp 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEp 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEp 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEp 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEp 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEp 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEp 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEp 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEp 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEp 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEp 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEp 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEp 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEp 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEp 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
