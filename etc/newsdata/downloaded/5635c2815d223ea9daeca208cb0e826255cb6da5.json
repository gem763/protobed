Can wearable tech pull you out of a slump?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n(Illustration by The Washington Post/iStock)\n\nLike a lot of people, I spend much of my workday staring at various screens \u2014 and, like a lot of people, I have the back and neck issues to prove it. Hunching and its associated symptoms are a hallmark of the digital age. Though I have a makeshift ergonomic setup in my home office, I often catch myself with my chin jutting forward as I lean toward my laptop \u2014 despite the fact that I\u2019m a regular Pilates student and former yoga teacher.\n\nClearly, my athletic training hasn\u2019t done enough to reinforce good habits. So, searching for a path to better posture, I spoke with two doctors about the problem and tried a few gadgets that promised to help me straighten things out.\n\n\u201cWe get into this stooped posture to get our faces close to the screen, which puts a lot of unnatural stress on the cervical spine,\u201d says Kaliq Chang, a double board-certified physician in interventional pain management and anesthesiology with Atlantic Spine Center in West Orange, N.J. Ideally, when you\u2019re sitting at your desk in front of a computer monitor, \u201cYou\u2019re meant to have the weight of your head situated over your neck in a manner that forces your chest out and your shoulders back, which requires having a monitor close to eye level,\u201d Chang says.\n\nWhen you hunch forward, whether at your desk or looking at your phone on the couch, the muscles in your neck and back extend while the ones in the front contract; over time, this can create an imbalance where they pull on one another unevenly. The effect would be minimal if we were only putting our necks and backs in awkward positions for minutes at a time, but people often spend hours out of whack.\n\n[Mermaiding is trendy. I hit the water in monofin and tail to see if it\u2019s also a workout.]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the problem lies,\u201d says Charla Fischer, an orthopedic surgeon at New York University\u2019s Langone Spine Center. When muscles are stretched in uncomfortable ways for prolonged periods of time, that can lead to injury involving microtears and swelling. \u201cAll muscles do is contract and relax. When they\u2019re injured, all they do is contract \u2014 and that\u2019s where we get spasms and pain.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, Fischer says she has seen a rise in young people \u2014 particularly recent college graduates new to the workforce \u2014 experiencing this exact scenario. For those working long hours in open offices at laptops instead of at monitors with ergonomic setups, the transition to so much screen time creates wear and tear. Poor posture also can evolve into a permanent stoop, Chang says, as the muscles and ligaments grow accustomed to the position and ultimately make it more difficult for the spine to straighten appropriately; other changes, such as bone spurs and even the reshaping of vertebrae, are also possible.\n\nLike Fischer, Chang says his patients get younger every year. \u201cMore recently, I\u2019ve had teenagers coming in, with a lot of what we call soft tissue injuries and problems, [such as] chronic pain in their neck, shoulders and mid-back.\u201d He attributes some of these issues to a combination of phone and laptop usage \u2014 a recipe for poor ergonomics and compromised posture. A 2013 National Institutes of Health study showed a high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain among undergraduate laptop users.\n\nThe result of all this time spent peering at screens, and the subsequent aches and pains, has led to a rise in products designed to improve posture, from sleek tech devices to body braces. Though some research has been done on the usage of tech wearables to monitor posture, the long-term results remain murky, and another NIH study that looked at the efficacy of posture-correcting braces suggests that their greatest benefit could be the increased self-awareness that comes from wearing one. \u201cThe latest theories of the utility of a back brace is that it is effective in reminding the patient that they should maintain proper posture and lifting technique, especially in those times they are most active,\u201d Chang says.\n\nOver the course of a month, I tested out three devices, two of which were harnesses. The slightly bulky Marakym posture corrector ($19.95 on Amazon) fits like a backpack without the pack: Adjustable padded straps loop over your shoulders and pull your body into better alignment. Designed to \u201cgently retrain your musculature so that you can effortlessly maintain an upright position over time,\u201d the Marakym is meant to be worn for up to 30 minutes per day.\n\nThe Berlin & Daughter posture corrector ($29.95 on Amazon), which I found more straightforward, is also a harness, but the two padded straps are fixed in length while a waist strap with Velcro connects at the front, allowing wearers to easily adjust the pull on their shoulders easily. It\u2019s recommended for use for 20 minutes per day, \u201cpreferably when standing,\u201d reads the packaging. Mild discomfort is \u201cyour body adjusting.\u201d\n\nBoth harness-style devices felt supportive, and I didn\u2019t personally experience any pain-related side effects. Though I don\u2019t think they did much to correct my posture, knowing that I was wearing one was a material reminder to sit up straight in the first place for the prescribed period of wear. This didn\u2019t surprise the doctors I spoke with.\n\n\u201cAny sort of brace can be a good reminder. But I don\u2019t typically recommend it for more than a few hours per day,\u201d Chang says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to weaken the muscles by relying too much on a brace.\u201d\n\nFischer agrees. \u201cIn general, I don\u2019t like anything that does the work for you,\u201d she says. \u201cI want your muscles actively working all day long. [The aim] is to train yourself to sit, stand and walk in a good position.\u201d\n\nI got more of that with the third device I tried. The Upright Go 2 ($99.95) \u2014 a \u201cpersonal posture trainer\u201d \u2014 is a wearable in the high-tech sense: You download the Upright app and then sync it to a small plastic gadget that connects to a smartphone through Bluetooth. It\u2019s easy to put on: You stick in the center of your back, between your shoulders \u2014 I wore mine just below the top knob of my spine \u2014 and it monitors your posture. Lean too far forward, and Upright begins to intermittently buzz. It\u2019s mildly annoying, and that\u2019s the point. Over time, the goal is to train yourself to maintain proper posture without the help of an external aid. It\u2019s all about building strength, stamina and good form.\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t necessarily need gadgets to do that. Fischer recommends performing \u201creverse\u201d stretches in the morning and evening \u2014 backward bending, for example \u2014 to counterbalance leaning forward throughout the day. \u201cWe talk about [body] symmetry, but we don\u2019t think about it with our neck and lower back.\u201d Regular neck stretching, mobility exercises and getting up from your desk once an hour to walk around and loosen up are also recommended \u2014 as are core workouts, such as Pilates, yoga or barre classes that help strengthen the muscles that help to maintain good posture.\n\nYou might even consider a few sessions with a physical therapist. If any discomfort is coupled with shooting pain in the arms or legs, however, Fischer and Chang recommend making an appointment with a doctor. \u201cIf someone is Googling [posture] devices because they are in a lot of pain, it\u2019s best to just go see the doc.\u201d\n\nBefore you do all that, you might want to look at your habits and make some behavioral changes. Research shows adjusting your computer screen height to eye level, keeping your keyboard and mouse in line with your elbows, and sitting with your feet on the floor make a difference, as can a pillow or pad supporting your lumbar spine. If you\u2019re someone who routinely works from the couch, it might be time to consider moving to the kitchen table or an at-home desk setup: According to Chang, over time, this position can potentially lead the lower half of the spine to sink down under the pelvis, resulting in weakening and disk degeneration. The long-term repercussions include chronic muscle strain and chronic neck and back pain.\n\nWherever you work, taking regular breaks from sitting to walk around and stretch is crucial. If you can\u2019t remember, Fischer recommends setting a timer on your phone reminding you to change positions every hour, ideally. \u201cThere is no scientific evidence on how frequently one should change positions. We know that sitting all day or standing all day is not good for you,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea is to create a habit you can live with.\u201d\n\nThough I could have worked on my posture gadget-free, the Upright\u2019s annoying buzz was the tap on the shoulder I needed. Because the app tracks your slumping statistics over time, I can tell that I\u2019ve made some progress; seeing that success quantified has the overall effect of making me stand a little taller \u2014 and sit up a little straighter.\n\nElizabeth Kiefer is a New York freelance writer who covers wellness issues.", "description": "As ever younger patients develop posture-related injuries, stretches, exercise and ergonomic desks can help.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Kiefer", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/omY6TRt5gkSBQUKLp2bIbjCOQW4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NOQP3IXDWYI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
