His delivery may be wooden but Arnie has a certain wit that appeals along with his memorable catchphrases (hasta la vista baby, I\u2019ll be back).\n\nWhile good old Arnie is back as the Terminator for the nth time \u2013 the same is unlikely to be said for fund manager Neil Woodford, who incidentally also has a rather wooden delivery, a little less wit and whose fate certainly looks dark. Just like the destiny of thousands of investors who look set to lose huge chunks of their investment in the disgraced fund manager\u2019s Equity Income fund that is in the process of being wound up.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger in the the new Terminator movie, Dark Fate\n\nFund managers across the industry have watched in alarm as events at Woodford Investment Management unfolded.\n\nIn the latest twist, last week the management of the fund\u2019s sister investment trust Woodford Patient Capital was transferred to Schroders (see our report on the demands by investors caught up in the Neil Woodford scandal).\n\nWoodford\u2019s troubles are largely of his own making \u2013 switching his successful and safe as houses investment style from his days at Invesco Perpetual to seriously risky \u2013 picking the shares of illiquid companies that were difficult to sell in a hurry. His fellow managers are hoping not to be tarred with the same brush.\n\nBut as a group they are already coming under increasing pressure to prove their worth. A fresh squeeze is being applied by Vanguard, one of the biggest players in the passive investment world.\n\nLast week it cut fees on 36 funds to an average ongoing annual charge of 0.2 per cent. Compare that to a not untypical 1.5 per cent ongoing on a fund run by a walking, talking, pinstripe type in the City.\n\nSean Hegarty, head of Vanguard for Europe, says investors are starting to question whether high fund managers\u2019 fees provide value for money. He tells the MoS \u2018there has long been a misconception that the more you pay for an investment, the better it performs\u2019.\n\nIn fact he argues that the more you pay, the less of your return you get to keep. Whilst there are some admirable managers out there who earn their generous wages there are plenty more that don\u2019t. Hegarty asserts: \u2018There are many things about investing you can\u2019t control, but cost is not one of them.\u2019\n\nTax return\n\nIf you got up this morning having forgotten that the clocks went back \u2013 then do not despair. You have just gained an extra hour of valuable me time. Do not go back to bed but instead use the spare 60 minutes to do all those painful yet fruitful activities you have been putting off \u2013 and still have a full Sunday ahead of you.\n\nThe filing deadline for the tax year ending April 2019 is this coming Thursday October 31 (if you do it online you have until January 31)\n\nThis extra time is particularly useful for people who prefer to file a tax return in old fashioned paper form. The filing deadline for the tax year ending April 2019 is this coming Thursday October 31 (if you do it online you have until January 31).\n\nMiss the cut-off date and you\u2019ll be fined \u00a3100, even if it turns out you don\u2019t owe any tax. You\u2019d be forgiven for overlooking this date \u2013 what with Halloween and a possible Brexit vying for attention in the diary.\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t started yet, spend half an hour gathering the paperwork \u2013 and sending any emails requesting any missing items urgently. If you are employed, this will include your P60, which states the tax paid on your income, and your P11D, which details expenses and benefits such as free health insurance.\n\nCheck what pension contributions you have made \u2013 so that you can claim tax relief. Any dividends from shares and interest from savings will also need to be declared \u2013 unless held in a tax-free Isa.\n\nIf you rent out a second property you will have to provide details of the income and expenses on a special extra page. This can be downloaded and printed from the internet \u2013 as can the whole tax return.\n\nIf you manage to gather the relevant information in that time pour a coffee and spend the remaining 30 minutes completing the forms.
