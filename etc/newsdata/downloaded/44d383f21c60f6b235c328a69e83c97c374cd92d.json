In remarks Thursday, the vice president ticked off a laundry list of U.S. concerns about Chinese behavior, from its suppression of the Uighur minority in its western Xinjiang Province, to attacks on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, to violation of international trade rules and more. He insisted that the two countries must work together toward a common future.\n\n\"People sometimes ask whether the Trump administration seeks to 'de-couple' from China,\" Pence said. \"The answer is a resounding 'no.' The United States seeks engagement with China and China's engagement with the wider world, but engagement in a manner consistent with fairness, mutual respect, and the international rules of commerce.\"\n\nThe speech, delivered at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, was a much-anticipated sequel to remarks the vice president delivered just over one year ago, which were widely interpreted as placing Washington on a new \"Cold War\" footing with Beijing. China\u2019s foreign ministry issued a blistering response on Friday, saying the U.S. should look to its own domestic problems, like gun violence, rather that critiquing China, Reuters reported.\n\nBut with both countries' economies showing the strains of a trade fight that is slowing growth worldwide, some saw signs of change in Pence's remarks.", "description": "Pence Hits China on Rights, Signals Flexibility on Trade", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/26/2019102600366_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
