The union will pay for the cost of COBRA insurance during the lapse.\n\nThe UAW expected to pick up that tab at some point, but the timing may have been something of a surprise. The Detroit ABC affiliate, WXYZ-TV, obtained a letter from the UAW\u2019s lead negotiator dated Monday seeking to confirm with GM that striking workers would have company coverage \u201cthrough the end of the month.\u201d\n\nUAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in his letter that he wanted to \u201callay any concerns\u201d of members.\n\nGM confirmed the insurance drop in a statement to HuffPost, saying, \u201cWe understand strikes are difficult and disruptive to families.\u201d The company noted that \u201csome benefits shift\u201d to the union during a strike.\n\nSome labor leaders pounced on the move as a cruel bit of hardball by GM. Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d to \u201cyank health care coverage away from their dedicated employees, in the dead of night, with no warning.\u201d\n\nThe move by GM ratchets up a battle that showed no imminent signs of ending Tuesday. The automaker and the union have been far apart on key issues, including starting wages and the use of temporary employees in GM plants. What\u2019s already the longest auto strike in a decade is set to surpass the two-day GM strike of 2007 by Wednesday.\n\nBill Pugliano via Getty Images United Auto Workers strike signs are shown at a gate at the General Motors Flint Assembly Plant in Michigan after the UAW declared a national strike after midnight Monday.\n\nWorkers have been girding for a long fight, arguing that they shouldn\u2019t have to give anything up when GM has been enjoying strong profits. This year\u2019s negotiations were expected to be the most difficult in a long time, as workers try to erase the concessions they made 12 years ago when GM was headed toward bankruptcy.\n\nThe union has built up a large war chest, with more than $700 million in its strike fund. It temporarily hiked dues in order to prepare for the possibility of a major walkout. In addition to the health coverage, workers will receive $250 a week in strike pay, raising the question of how long they can last before they feel squeezed financially.\n\nJessie Kelly, an apprentice mold maker at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, told HuffPost on Monday that she had saved up for the possibility of a long and painful strike.\n\n\u201cI could live out three months,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI 100% feel this strike is necessary.\u201d", "description": "The union will be covering the cost of COBRA during the lapse.", "authors": ["Labor Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bcf212400002e2a798640.jpeg?cache=glwo7f97uk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
