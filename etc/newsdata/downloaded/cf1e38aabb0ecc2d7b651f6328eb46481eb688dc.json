Specifically, I saw the Huawei app store as if I was a user from the UK.\n\nThe choice of apps isn\u2019t looking too good.\n\nI saw a few recognizable apps, but those with mass appeal only tallied a total of three, including Amazon, TikTok, and Fortnite. Recognizable apps included Booking.com and Aliexpress.\n\nsource Business Insider\n\nOf those apps I saw in Huawei\u2019s app store, I only have Amazon installed on my Android phone right now. So if I were to buy the Huawei Mate 30 smartphone in the UK, the only app I\u2019d want from Huawei\u2019s app store is Amazon.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Huawei hasn\u2019t set a release date for the Mate 30. Perhaps Huawei will manage to add a few more big and popular apps by the time it announces a release date.\n\nHuawei did not reply to Business Insider\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe company did, however, list the price tags for the Mate 30 phones:\n\nHuawei Mate 30: 700 Euros\n\n700 Euros Huawei Mate 30 Pro: 1,100 Euros\n\nHuawei also called for developers to make apps for its app store during its Mate 30 launch event with a $1 billion incentive program.\n\nThe Mate 30 smartphones have all the makings of great Android smartphones. They have powerful specs, multiple camera lenses, and a variety of great features. But without apps, none of that matters very much.", "description": "Business Insider - The only app available on Huawei's app store that I'd download is Amazon.
