According to her sister, she had been saving for her trip, which began in Vietnam, for two years and was having \u201cthe best time ever\u201d. CCTV footage shows her arriving at the party around 2am and friends report seeing her there at 3am. She has not been seen again since.\n\nTwo hundred soldiers and police officers have been involved in the subsequent search for Amelia, who is from Sussex. Her family have arrived on the island and six local men are being questioned. On the beach where she was last seen, her bag, phone and credit cards have been found.\n\nOn Monday, her father says he hopes for a miracle , but doesn\u2019t expect to see his daughter alive again. Now Cambodian police fear she has drowned after claiming searches on land and sea had failed to provide any information about her disappearance. However, the police have vowed that the hunt will continue until she is found.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn recent years we\u2019ve seen a recurrent trend of young, female, British backpackers going missing while travelling abroad, or being sexually assaulted and even murdered. In 2018, 22-year-old Essex backpacker Grace Millane was murdered in New Zealand and in 2016, Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 21, from Derbyshire, was stabbed to death at her Australian hostel in front of dozens of witnesses. In 2014, Hannah Witheridge, 21, from Norfolk, was murdered while backpacking in Thailand along with her male friend, David Miller. Before her death, Hannah was also raped.\n\nThe day after I turned 21, I went to Costa Rica for a week by myself. My mum\u2019s friend was living a few miles away from my accommodation, but I spent a lot of time without her. I grew up with a strict, cautious dad and his safety rules had stuck. I insisted on seatbelts in cars, helmets on bikes, I didn\u2019t carry lots of money on me and I listened to my instinct when it came to things I did and didn\u2019t do. Amelia\u2019s father also says he \u201cspoke to her about safety, safety, safety, safety,\u201d .\n\nBut even after taking those actions, I was never truly safe. My bikini top and shorts could have been deemed provocative, \u201casking for it\u201d. A two minute walk from a restaurant to my room after dark may also have been an empty dirt path with waiting, watching eyes. The camera I wore around my neck was a beacon blaring out my backpacker status.\n\nI was young, not stupid, and had anything happened to me, I wouldn\u2019t have deserved it. It wouldn\u2019t have been my fault. Wearing the clothes I wanted and walking the route I wanted should have been a right, not a risk. But I was always at the mercy of a terrible decision by an awful stranger or a violent group of men.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

She left for the party with six friends and Mia was surrounded by around 30 people as she was stabbed. It goes to show that the danger I was in at the same age as both girls was not simply because I was travelling solo. It was because I was travelling as a woman.\n\nThe same applies for travelling here in the UK. I\u2019d never get on an empty tube, tram or train carriage. A friend of mine was once set upon by a group of men who boarded her previously empty train carriage and blocked CCTV cameras.\n\nI'd never jump into a taxi on the street, but instead rely on apps that allow me to book and then share my journey, ETA and driver details with my husband. A friend of a friend was recently in a taxi when the driver locked the doors and drove her to the top floor of an empty multi-storey car park.\n\nIf I need to walk in quiet areas of my hometown Leeds after dark, I\u2019ll send my whereabouts to my husband via the location tracker function on Facebook Messenger. I do what I can to reduce risk wherever possible, even if it costs me money or time. It\u2019s about doing the best I can in situations where I have inherently less power, simply because of my gender.\n\nAnd it is because of my gender. My husband admits he\u2019s never felt in danger in a taxi or on other public transport in this country. Abroad, he is worried about language barriers causing unintentional offence, but not attack. Several other male friends echo his sentiments. One told me how he walks home from work and town after dark all the time. While a female friend messaged me saying how much she fancies going for a run, but can\u2019t because it will be dark when she finishes work. The contrast is startling, the injustice indisputable.\n\nNow at the opposite end of my 20s, I\u2019m preparing for a solo trip to Rio next month. I plan to only get taxis arranged by my hotel. I won\u2019t rely on free wifi spots, instead paying for data at all times. I\u2019ll memorise the basic phrases so as not to draw attention to myself as a tourist unnecessarily when passing shops or groups of locals. I won\u2019t drink, I\u2019ll dress neutrally, but even still just being there will be a risk. Then again, so too will coming home. There isn\u2019t a place where being a woman isn\u2019t inherently dangerous.", "description": "Last Wednesday, 21-year-old Amelia Bambridge was at a beach party on the Cambodian island of Koh Rong.
