In June, his campaign signalled that he supported that amendment, which put him at odds with much of the Democratic Party.\n\nHe said days later at a gala that he does not support that amendment.\n\nThe Catholic church contends that human life must be respected and protected from the moment of conception.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Joe Biden has been denied Holy Communion at a South Carolina church, as a result of his pro-choice stance on the Democratic campaign trail.
