He also played down the extent of the breach.\n\n\u201cIt was picked up very early while it was at the user level, before it reached the applications level where critical information sits,\" he told a TV news reporter. \u201cSo for us it was important that we safeguard the information first, before we start with the remedial work.\u201d\n\nAll your servers have been hacked\n\nAccounts on Twitter told a different story. This purported image of the ransom note, which was addressed to \u201cJoberg city\u201d claimed to have full control over the city's network. Rather than encrypting the data and demanding a ransom in return for the encryption key, the attackers appeared to threaten to publish the data unless the money was handed over.\n\n\u201cAll of your servers have been hacked,\u201d the note stated. \u201cWe have dozens of backdoors inside your city.\u201d The note went on to demand the Bitcoin ransom by Monday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay on time, we will upload the whole data to anyone on the Internet,\u201d the note continued. \u201cIf you pay on time, we will destroy all the data we have, and we will send you IT a full report about how we hacked your system and your security\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s Twitter messages also said the site outages weren\u2019t the result of Johannesburg officials taking their systems offline as the officials claimed, but rather the hacking group turning off the city\u2019s domain name system, which is used to help translate domain names into IP addresses. Another Twitter message posted what purported to be screenshots showing DNS controls and an Active Directory set up for Johannesburg City network.\n\nThis is the second breach in the past three months to hit the city. In July, Johannesburg\u2019s municipal power provider suffered a ransomware attack that left residents without electricity.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, at least 621 government entities, healthcare service providers and school districts, colleges and universities have been hit by ransomware, according to security firm Emsisoft recently reported. At least 68 of those attacks were on state, county and municipal entities. An attack in June on Baltimore cost the city at least $18 million. Three Florida cities were also infected this year.\n\nEmsisoft spokesman Brett Callow told Ars that the Johannesburg attackers appeared to be new to the ransomware scene.\n\n\u201cThe personalized login screen message is quite unusual and not one we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cNor is the email address provided in the ransom note one that we\u2019ve seen used in other attacks (it\u2019s also never been used in any previous submission to ID Ransomware).\u201d\n\nThe Johannesburg spokesman, meanwhile, said the city\u2019s IT staff is working around the clock to get systems back online.", "description": "Attackers claim to have full control of network and demand $32,000 to give it back.", "authors": ["Dan Goodin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/johannesburg-city-hall-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
