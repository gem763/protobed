THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY.\n\nThe technology, called electric fracking and powered by natural gas from EOG\u2019s own wells instead of costly diesel fuel, shows how shale producers keep finding new ways to cut costs in the face of pressures to improve their returns.\n\nE-frac, as the new technology is called, is being adopted by EOG, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp and others because of its potential to lower costs, reduce air pollution and operate much quieter than conventional diesel-powered frac fleets. Investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co analyst George O\u2019Leary estimates e-fracs could lop off up to $350,000 from the cost of shale wells that run $6 million to $8 million apiece.\n\nBut these systems can cost oilfield service companies up to twice as much to build compared to conventional frac fleets. A rapid uptake could worsen the economics for a sector already cutting staff and idling equipment as oil producers pare their spending. That leaves this potentially breakthrough technology to small providers without the means to fully exploit it.\n\nONE-SIDED SAVINGS Jeff Miller, chief executive of Halliburton Co, the top U.S. provider of fracking services, said his firm has tested the technology but has no desire to promote it.\n\n\u201cHalliburton will be really slow around frac,\u201d Miller said, referring to the costs of updating diesel systems to electric. Converting the industry\u2019s 500 frac fleets would cost $30 billion, he estimated, too steep a price for oilfield firms, he said.\n\nHe recently advised an oil producer interested in the technology that the benefits of deploying e-fracs \u201cwork for you, they don\u2019t work for us,\u201d he said at Barclays energy conference this month.\n\nHalliburton, Schlumberger NV and others have idled scores of diesel-powered fleets this year as producers cut spending due to flat to lower oil and gas prices. Consultancy Primary Vision estimates the number of active fleets in the U.S. fell 19% since April to around 390.\n\nHalliburton cut 8% of its North American workforce and reported second-quarter profit fell 85% over the year-ago period in part because of equipment writedowns and severance costs due to weak demand for its frac service.\n\n\u201cEvery week that goes by I get more and more negative about e-frac due to the harsh imbalance between the benefits achieved by the oil company and the costs incurred by the service company,\u201d said Richard Spears, a consultant to top oilfield services suppliers.\n\nSchlumberger paid $430 million in late 2017 to acquire a diesel-powered frac fleet from rival Weatherford International, hoping to expand shale services. A spokesperson declined to comment on e-frac.\n\nThis month newly-named CEO Olivier Le Peuch disclosed plans to write down investments that were \u201cbased on a much higher activity outlook with the ambition of achieving economies of scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cHARD TO JUSTIFY\u201d\n\nE-frac supplier Evolution Well Services, which supplied the equipment and crew for EOG\u2019s Eagle Ford shale operation, is one of a handful of smaller oilfield firms pioneering the systems.\n\nEvolution operates six e-frac fleets - mobile collections of high-pressure pumps powered by gas turbine generators - and plans to roll out a seventh next year. U.S. Well Services, another e-frac provider, has agreements with Apache Corp and Shell. Conventional pressure pumper ProPetro Holding Corp also announced plans to bring a handful of e-frac fleets to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d kind of would like to\u201d build more systems without firm customer contracts, said Ben Bodishbaugh, CEO of Evolution, the only purely e-frac provider in North America. \u201cBut in this market it\u2019s hard to justify,\u201d he said.\n\nThe reason: e-frac fleets can cost up to $60 million apiece because they rely on pricey gas turbines similar to those that run utilities to generate electricity, compared with as little as $30 million for a diesel-motor powered fleet. Evolution would not say how much its fleets cost, but noted it is below $60 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad time for service companies to be ramping up very capital intensive service offerings,\u201d said Josh Young, chief investment officer with energy investor Bison Interests. \u201cPeople always feel pressure to invest in the next new things, but sometimes you shouldn\u2019t be investing in any of the things.\u201d\n\nCompanies like Evolution and U.S. Well Services that already have e-frac fleets would be winners if the technology takes off, analysts from investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt & Co predict. E-frac accounts for about 3% of active fleets, and could reach between 25% and 33% in the next five years, Tudor estimated.\n\nEOG began testing Evolution\u2019s gear in late 2016, and signed a multi-year agreement about six months later. The shale company, well known for its use of cutting edge technology, runs four of Evolution\u2019s fleets and plans to add a fifth next year.\n\nThe agreement with Evolution \u201cis an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions to both reduce our environmental footprint and improve the profitability of our business,\u201d said Billy Helms, EOG\u2019s chief operating officer. EOG is among the handful of top shale producers that generate more cash than they consume in drilling and shareholder dividends.\n\nNO SOOT, LESS NOISE\n\nAt its Smiley, Texas, oil and gas well site, EOG\u2019s crew carried on casual conversations despite the whir of e-frac pumps. No one wears ear protection, which is common at conventional diesel fleets, and the towering white silos holding frac sand were gleaming during a visit in August. At a conventional frac site just up the road, the towers were black from diesel exhaust.\n\nEvolution\u2019s Bodishbaugh said some oil and gas firms see less polluting e-frac as improving their standing with investors who rate environmental, social and governance (ESG) attributes in their investments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say this year we\u2019ve probably had more inbounds calls on the emissions profile than the economic savings,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul Mecray III, a managing director for investment firm Tower Bridge Advisors who follows major service companies, said e-frac will only catch on if overall demand for oilfield services recovers.\n\n\u201cWhile it may be a good thing longer term, I think it will take a lot longer to catch on than people think,\u201d he said.", "description": "At a dusty drilling site east of San Antonio, shale producer EOG Resources Inc recently completed its latest well using a new technology developed by a small services firm that promises to slash the cost of each by $200,000.", "authors": ["Liz Hampton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429030369&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0PB-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
