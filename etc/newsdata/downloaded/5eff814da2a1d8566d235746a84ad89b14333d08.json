Christopher Hasson earlier this month asked the judge to drop two charges for unlawful possession of firearm silencers.\n\nThe lawyers argued that possession of a silencer is protected under the Second Amendment because it is \u201cindispensable\u201d to the use of a gun.\n\nU.S. District Judge George Hazel rejected their claim, saying silencers are not \u201ccritical\u201d to the use of a firearm and cannot be viewed as a weapon under the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cAlthough silencers may improve the usage of a firearm, they are not necessary and they are not therefore protected by the Second Amendment,\u201d he wrote in an opinion released Monday.\n\nLt. Hasson will now stand trial next month for all four federal counts against him. In addition to the two silencer charges, he also faces one count of possession of a firearm by an unlawful drug user and possession of a controlled substance.\n\nIf convicted on all four charges, he could face up to 31 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors have not filed any terrorism charges against Lt. Hasson, who was arrested in February. But court documents describe him as a white supremacist who plotted a \u201cmassive\u201d terror attack to ignite a race war.\n\nLt. Hasson was stockpiling weapons and authored a manifesto in which he openly wrote about ways \u201cto kill every last person on earth,\u201d prosecutors say.\n\nHis trial is scheduled to start Oct. 21.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
