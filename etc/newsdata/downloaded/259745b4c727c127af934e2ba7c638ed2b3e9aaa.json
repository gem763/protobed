Plans from the top 20 car manufacturers suggest a tenfold increase in annual electric car sales, to 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, from 2 million in 2018. Starting from a low base, less than 0.5% of the total car stock, this growth in electric vehicles means that nearly 7% of the car fleet will be electric by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, the conventional car market has been showing signs of fatigue, with sales declining in 2018 and 2019, due to slowing economies. Global sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars fell by around 2% to under 87 million in 2018, the first drop since the 2008 recession. Data for 2019 points to a continuation of this trend, led by China, where sales in the first half of the year fell nearly 14%, and India where they declined by 10%.\n\nThese trends have created a narrative of an imminent peak in passenger car oil demand, and related CO 2 emissions, and the beginning of the end for the \u201cICE age.\u201d As passenger cars consume nearly one-quarter of global oil demand today, does this signal the approaching erosion of a pillar of global oil consumption?\n\nA more silent structural change may put this conclusion into question: consumers are buying ever larger and less fuel-efficient cars, known as Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs).\n\nThis dramatic shift towards bigger and heavier cars has led to a doubling of the share of SUVs over the last decade. As a result, there are now over 200 million SUVs around the world, up from about 35 million in 2010, accounting for 60% of the increase in the global car fleet since 2010. Around 40% of annual car sales today are SUVs, compared with less than 20% a decade ago.\n\nUnited States Europe China India South Africa World 2010 27 10 14 11 20 17 2011 30 12 16 12 19 20 2012 29 14 19 14 19 21 2013 31 16 22 18 20 23 2014 34 19 25 19 22 25 2015 38 21 31 18 23 29 2016 42 24 37 22 23 33 2017 45 28 42 27 25 36 2018 48 33 42 30 27 39\n\n{\"chart\":{\"type\":\"line\"},\"plotOptions\":{\"line\":{\"marker\":{\"enabled\":false}}},\"yAxis\":{\"labels\":{\"format\":\"{value}%\"},\"title\":{\"text\":\"\"},\"tickInterval\":10},\"title\":{\"text\":\"Share of SUVs in total car sales in key markets\"},\"tooltip\":{\"valueSuffix\":\"%\"},\"series\":[{\"colorIndex\":2},{\"colorIndex\":3},{\"colorIndex\":7},{\"colorIndex\":8},{\"colorIndex\":0},{\"colorIndex\":4,\"dashStyle\":\"dot\"}]}\n\nThis trend is universal. Today, almost half of all cars sold in the United States and one-third of the cars sold in Europe are SUVs. In China, SUVs are considered symbols of wealth and status. In India, sales are currently lower, but consumer preferences are changing as more and more people can afford SUVs. Similarly, in Africa, the rapid pace of urbanisation and economic development means that demand for premium and luxury vehicles is relatively strong.\n\nThe impact of its rise on global emissions is nothing short of surprising. The global fleet of SUVs has seen its emissions growing by nearly 0.55 Gt CO 2 during the last decade to roughly 0.7 Gt CO 2 . As a consequence, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO 2 emissions since 2010 after the power sector, but ahead of heavy industry (including iron & steel, cement, aluminium), as well as trucks and aviation.\n\nChange in emissions Change in emissions Power 1405 0 SUVs 0 544 Heavy Industry 365 0 Trucks 311 0 Aviation 233 0 Shipping 80 0 Other ICEs -75 0\n\n{\"chart\":{\"type\":\"column\"},\"plotOptions\":{\"column\":{\"stacking\":\"normal\"}},\"title\":{\"text\":\"Change in CO2 emissions by energy sector, 2010-18\"},\"yAxis\":{\"title\":{\"text\":\"Mt CO2\"},\"tickInterval\":400},\"tooltip\":{\"valueSuffix\":\"Mt CO2\"},\"legend\":{\"enabled\":false},\"series\":[{\"colorIndex\":2},{\"colorIndex\":8}]}\n\nOn average, SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than medium-size cars. As a result, global fuel economy worsened caused in part by the rising SUV demand since the beginning of the decade, even though efficiency improvements in smaller cars saved over 2 million barrels a day, and electric cars displaced less than 100,000 barrels a day.\n\nIn fact, SUVs were responsible for all of the 3.3 million barrels a day growth in oil demand from passenger cars between 2010 and 2018, while oil use from other type of cars (excluding SUVs) declined slightly. If consumers\u2019 appetite for SUVs continues to grow at a similar pace seen in the last decade, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars.\n\nThe upcoming World Energy Outlook will focus on this under-appreciated area in the energy debate today, and examines the possible evolution of the global car market, electrification trends, and consumer preferences and provides insights for policy makers.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.iea.org/media/news/2019/191015SUVCommentary.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
