Failure to get it right could cause lasting damage to the Norther Irish peace process laid down in the Good Friday agreement.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote in the Guardian that although Mr Johnson\u2019s latest gambit represented \u2018a significant concession\u2019 it created an \u2018incoherent muddle leading to a bizarre outcome\u2019\n\nMr Blair said: \u2018Crucial to maintenance of the peace was the idea of an open border between north and south in recognition of the fact that around the border families intermingled, did business and trade and moved, often several times a day, across it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They were separate countries but treated for the practical purposes of daily life as if they were the same.\u2019\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair says a hard border in Ireland threatens to destabilise peace (Picture: Bloomberg Finance LP)\n\nHe said Europe\u2019s role in the 1998 agreement was key as trade had become a vital part of the island of Ireland\u2019s economy, diminishing the border\u2019s significance.\n\nMr Blair concluded: \u2018The open border between north and south was key. Had that been in doubt, there would never have been a peace agreement. Simple as that.\u2019\n\nBut Mr Johnson argued his position represented compromise \u2013 or the UK \u2018jumping to the island in the middle of the river\u2019 \u2013 and that the EU should follow suit.\n\nWriting in the Sun on Sunday, he added: \u2018If we\u2019re to leave with a deal, we now need the EU to jump over from its side and join us there, showing its own willingness to do a deal that the UK Parliament can support.\u2019\n\nUndeterred, the PM called on MPs to back his deal saying the EU would be more likely to accept Britain\u2019s \u2018outstretched hand\u2019 and make that \u2018leap on to the island\u2019 if he was armed with a set of proposals parliament supported.\n\nOther ministers including Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay have also written in support of Johnson\u2019s proposal (Picture: PA)\n\nHe added: \u2018So I say to our European friends: grasp the opportunity that our new proposal provides. Join us at the negotiating table in a spirit of compromise and co-operation. And let\u2019s make Brexit work for both sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are leaving in 25 days. We can do it with a deal if the EU is willing.\n\nPrince Harry tour inspires UK to give Zimbabwe \u00a32,000,000 to clear landmines\n\n\u2018But they should be under no illusions or misapprehensions. There will be no more dither. No more delay. On October 31 we are going to get Brexit done.\u2019\n\nThe united front was maintained in other titles with Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay writing in the Sunday Telegraph that the country was \u2018approaching the moment of truth\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018We hope the EU will come to the table in the spirit of compromise and match our creativity and flexibility.\n\n\u2018If they do, we will leave with a new deal. If they shut the door on us, then we are prepared to leave without a deal.\n\n\u2018But the latter would be in neither side\u2019s interest. It would bring disruption for us, and disruption for the EU.\u2019\n\nAnd Nicky Morgan, who voted remain and is now culture secretary, wrote in the Observer that Johnson\u2019s plan was \u2018the best chance we have to break the deadlock and leave.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
