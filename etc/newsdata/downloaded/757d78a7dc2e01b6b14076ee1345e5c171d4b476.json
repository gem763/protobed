He's put enough out there on tape to say he deserves a shot, without a doubt.\"\n\nCase Keenum ultimately won the job, but he has struggled to protect the ball with six turnovers in four games. Following a 31-15 loss to the Chicago Bears in Week 3 when Keenum had five turnovers, Gruden didn't sound like he was close to playing Haskins.\n\n\"Not really,\" Gruden told reporters. \"I can't be changing people every five minutes.\"\n\nHaskins did see game action in Week 4 against the Giants. He replaced Keenum, who had been dealing with a foot injury, in the second quarter. The 22-year-old went 9-of-17 for 107 yards and had three interceptions.\n\nWashington hasn't named its starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots.", "description": "Washington Redskins  head coach  Jay Gruden 's apparent reluctance to play Dwayne Haskins may have something to do with a report that he didn't want to draft the former Ohio State star...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/831/405/hi-res-a49043f9b7bf886a5797ad5095bc8da6_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
