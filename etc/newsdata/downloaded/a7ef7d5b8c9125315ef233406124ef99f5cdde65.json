In the blog post announcing Blitzchung's ban, Blizzard said he had violated the rules of the competition by making statements that were harmful to the company.\n\nThe decision led to widespread backlash from Blizzard fans, professional gamers, and even US lawmakers. After the announcement was posted, someone covered up two of the company's key values \u2014 \"Think Globally\" and \"Every Voice Matters\" \u2014 enshrined on a statue at the company's headquarters.\n\nRead more: Some Blizzard employees reportedly walked out to protest the punishment of a 'Hearthstone' competitor who spoke up in support of the Hong Kong protests\n\nMany Blizzard fans accused the company of protecting its business interests in China rather than upholding free speech; Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon suggested Blizzard's punishment was an act of censorship on behalf of China's government.\n\nMei from \"Overwatch\" becomes a mascot for the Hong Kong protests\n\nUpset fans have pledged to boycott Blizzard's games as a result of Blitzchung's ban, and dozens of people have shared screenshots of themselves deleting their Blizzard accounts or canceling subscriptions to Blizzard's \"World of Warcraft.\"\n\nA few people latched onto the idea of using Mei, a Chinese character from \"Overwatch\" in pro-protest messages in an attempt to sour China's relationship with Blizzard. China's government has strict regulations on what games are released in the country, and games that promote deeply political messages or rebellion against the government are specifically prohibited.\n\nWhile Mei isn't normally much of a rebel in her game, fans have taken liberties with her design to make her an emblem of the protests in Hong Kong. This includes draping her in the design of Hong Kong's flag and drawing pictures of her wearing symbols of the protests, like umbrellas and gas masks.\n\n\u2014\ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 Marshy wants 5 demands like, yesterday \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 (@marshedblob) October 9, 2019\n\nSome fans think that if the Mei protest memes get popular enough, China will consider banning \"Overwatch\" from the country entirely.\n\nChina spends more than any other country in the world on video games, so maintaining a healthy relationship with the country is important for Activision Blizzard's future growth. Five of the 20 teams in the professional Overwatch League are Chinese franchises, with an approximate value of $20 million each.\n\nBlizzard has yet to issue a public statement on the situation since the initial announcement of Blitzchung's ban.", "description": "A movement to boycott Blizzard Entertainment has turned one of the company's characters into a symbol for the protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da099f7cc4a0a354a795194?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
