We had discussions and debates on many issues.\u201d\n\nBanerjee was recognised for his work on fighting poverty and some said the award was a repudiation of policies pursued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBanerjee, who won the prize along with Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, has been critical of the Modi government, saying some of its economic decisions, such as banning high-value currency notes, were \u201cweird\u201d.\n\nIn March, he joined 107 economists and social scientists in seeking an end to political interference in India\u2019s statistics institutions, saying the integrity of economic data must be protected after allegations that growth had been inflated and figures showing unemployment at a 45-year high suppressed.\n\nNonetheless, Modi offered praise. \u201cCongratulations to Abhijit Banerjee ... He has made notable contributions in the field of poverty alleviation,\u201d he said in a Tweet.\n\nOthers were more ebullient.\n\n\u201cBig day for every Indian. Heartiest congratulations to eminent economist Abhijit Banerjee ... Work on poverty alleviation gets highest endorsement,\u201d Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.\n\nThe leader of India\u2019s main opposition Congress party said Banerjee, who is based in the United States, had helped the party draft the minimum income scheme to fight poverty on which it fought elections earlier this year.\n\nBut the Congress suffered a resounding defeat at the hands of Modi\u2019s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party which ran a campaign focused on national security.\n\nBanerjee had helped conceptualise a programme that had the power to destroy poverty and boost the economy, Gandhi said.\n\n\u201cInstead we now have Modinomics, that\u2019s destroying the economy and boosting poverty.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBanerjee told India\u2019s online news outlet The Wire in 2017 that the Modi government didn\u2019t seem to have any new economic plan, despite its promise to transform India and free it from the yoke of government.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, there are a couple of weird things that the government did, one of those things was demonetization. I don\u2019t think there was any serious economics in it, and there was no particular reason it would do much good,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shock ban on currency notes in 2016, which Modi hailed as part of a broader fight against corruption, is widely seen to have contributed to the economic slowdown along with a hastily implemented national goods and service tax.", "description": "Indian politicians and academics cheered the Nobel economics prize awarded on Monday to Indian-born American Abhijit Banerjee, whose proud mother told visitors crowding into her apartment that he came from \"a family of economists\".", "authors": ["Sanjeev Miglani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440831360&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1AT", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
