Err, I\u2019ll ask Una whether she\u2019ll come or not, and then we\u2019ll see. Obviously my wife will come as well and she\u2019ll support me.\u2019\n\nWhen grilled further about whether his near-decade long romance with Una had helped him when preparing for the reality show, he said: \u2018Una was always really supportive of me doing singing and stuff.\n\n'I did shows. I did singing on All Together Now and League Of Their Own, and Una was always very supportive of me doing that.\n\n\u2018She\u2019d always, like, coach me a little bit. But she doesn\u2019t have very much patience with me because I\u2019m not the best singer.\n\nWhirlwind: Ben hit the headlines in August when he tied the knot with Jackie just two weeks after they first began dating\n\n'And, she\u2019d be like: \u201cdo this\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d and she\u2019d be like: \u201ceveryone knows what that is in the singing industry\u201d.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, it\u2019s been great for us to go and actually work with real vocal coaches and learn how to harmonize and learn all the serious sides about being in a band together.\n\n\u2018So I did get the tiniest fraction of a little bit of head start. But we all have individual starts: Levi comes from a musical school, Tom was in a boyband back in 1964.\u2019\n\nBen also laughed off the idea of receiving negative criticism on the band's performance, saying: 'I\u2019m used to it.\u2019\n\nThe hunk also discussed the revealing outfit he wore for his performance, explaining his nerve caused him expose more of his torso.\n\nBand: Speaking at the press launch of the show on Wednesday, the rugby player, 34, competing in band Try Star with fellow sportsman Thom Evans and Levi Davis, said he hopes Saturdays singer Una, 37, will support his musical endeavours\n\nFamily: He said: 'Obviously my kids [will come], I\u2019d love to get them down to the show. Err, I\u2019ll ask Una whether she\u2019ll come or not, and then we\u2019ll see' (pictured 2017)\n\nHe said: \u2018The longer the night went on and the more nervous I got, the more buttons I undid. And when I heard people sing I was like \u201cOh my god they\u2019re so good, we\u2019re gonna need something else here.\u201d\n\nI tried to encourage these two but they wouldn\u2019t join in. That\u2019s why I got down to one (button). I had one left.\u2019\n\nThe candid comments about his ex comes days after Ben asked for Una's forgiveness after making 'the biggest mistake' by cheating on her.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun on Saturday, the rugby player admitted that he hoped the singer would forgive him for his infidelity during their marriage.\n\nHe said candidly: 'I hope Una will forgive me. I made the biggest mistake and the most \u00adstupid mistake you can make in a relationship.\n\nSupport: When grilled further about whether his near-decade long romance with Una had helped him when preparing for the reality show, he said: \u2018Una was always really supportive of me doing singing and stuff (pictured 2017)\n\n'We seemed like a perfect match but people never know what happens behind closed doors. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Una and I were struggling for a number of years.'\n\nBen added that cheating on her was 'the final nail in the coffin' of their marriage.\n\nUna and Ben married in Ireland in 2012 after four years of dating. They welcomed daughter Aoife shortly before they got married, and son Tadhg in 2015.\n\nIn February, he admitted cheating on Una, telling The Guardian: 'At the moment anything that\u2019s published about me is never very good and pretty rightly so because I was the one who committed adultery.\n\n'At the same time, it wasn\u2019t the only reason for our divorce to go through. It\u2019s not ideal, but we\u2019re very amicable, we\u2019re getting through it, we\u2019re not the first people in the world to get divorced. We\u2019ve got two little kids we adore.'\n\nAwkward: He added: 'Obviously my wife will come as well and she\u2019ll support me'\n\nBen's tattered reputation suffered a further blow in 2018 after he used dating app Bumble to publicly announce his separation from the former The Saturdays star.\n\nThe couple confirmed their separation after six years of marriage in July last year, following his alleged affair with PR girl Becky Milne.\n\nBen hit the headlines again in August when he tied the knot with Jackie just two weeks after they first began dating.\n\nThe star made the announcement on his Instagram account and revealed that he had received Una's blessing for the marriage.\n\nA week after the nuptials, Ben reunited with his son and daughter as he gushed that 'the only thing that matters is family.'\n\nAmid an array of claims arising about Ben's dating activities prior to marrying Jackie, the rugby player's pal insisted he wasn't faithful during the start of their still-fledgling romance.\n\nThe insider told MailOnline: 'He was 100% seeing Jackie at the same time as [former Big Brother contestant] Rebecca Jane and the other women. He's probably done this [married her] for a green card to stay in the US.'\n\nHappier times: The candid comments about his ex comes days after Ben asked for Una's forgiveness after making 'the biggest mistake' by cheating on her (pictured May 2018)\n\nThe insider added: 'Before he married Jackie, he and Rebecca Jane talked about having children and it was completely ruled out.\n\n'They discussed it at length and he definitely wasn't interested in having anymore kids.\n\n'But, I wouldn't be surprised if he does with this latest turn of events. His posts with his kids on Saturday are just a blatant attempt to repair his image and for attention.'\n\nThe celebrity line up is Megan McKenna, 27, The Islanders - made up of Love Island 2018 contestants Wes Nelson, 21, Zara McDermott, 22, Samira Mighty and Eyal Booker, 24, Ricki Lake, 51, Hayley Hasselhoff, 27, The Chase star Jenny Ryan, 37, Cole & Edwards - made up of Strictly star - Brendan Cole, 43 and actor Jeremy Edwards, 48, Glee star Kevin McHale, 31.\n\nOnly recently, in an interview ahead of the launch, Simon revealed the reason why he decided to revamp the normal show into a celebrity version.\n\n'It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version', he explained. 'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it. I said to the team, \"You\u2019ve got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don\u2019t do that it won\u2019t work.\"\n\n'So that was the deal and we stuck to it. I swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were. I did walk away thinking, \u201cIf we\u2019re smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this\u201d. So I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.'\n\nThe music boss also shared how he felt about holding the auditions in his own back garden.\n\nHe said: 'When we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work. I loved every second of it. I said to the producers, \u201cIf this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\n'So the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great. I found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars. I\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant. I\u2019ve loved every minute.'\n\nThis series, like the civilian version, will see the acts split into three groups; the overs, the unders and the groups.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity starts Saturday 12th October 8:35pm on ITV.", "description": "Ben Foden has revealed that he plans to invite ex wife Una Healy to attend the live shows of The X Factor: Celebrity, alongside new spouse Jackie Belanoff-Smith.", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips", "Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534764-0-image-a-33_1570704721815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
