REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files\n\nWith worries over turbulence in Hong Kong and global growth feeding losses for stock markets globally, the FTSE 250 index of midcap firms .FTMC dipped 0.4% by 0745 GMT.\n\nHelped by a dip for the pound GBP= in response to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's failure to get MPs to back his accelerated Brexit timetable overnight, the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 .FTSE edged 0.2% higher.\n\nPrecious metals miner Fresnillo (FRES.L) dropped nearly 2% after it forecast annual silver and gold production at the lower end of an already reduced target range, and reported a fall in quarterly output.\n\nWhile lawmakers voted for a second hearing on the departure agreement, rejection of Johnson\u2019s timetable raises the likelihood of another delay in Britain\u2019s withdrawal as well as the prospect of a snap election before Christmas.\n\n\u201cThe latest twist in the Brexit saga also means that investors may have to contend with more political risk by way of a UK election,\u201d said Han Tan, Market Analyst at FXTM.\n\nRaymond James analyst Chris Bailey called the Brexit situation \u201ca mess\u201d overall and said the core scenario of an extension or an election was becoming more likely.\n\nThe uncertainty around Brexit and its consequences continues to show up in the performance of UK firms. Housebuilders .FTNMX3720, considered among the most vulnerable, lost nearly 1%, with Barratt (BDEV.L), Persimmon (PSN.L) and Berkeley (BKGH.L) the biggest losers on the blue chip index.\n\nThat was offset by gains for companies who earn largely in foreign currencies including British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L).\n\nMiner Centamin (CEY.L) also shone on the FTSE 250 with a 3% gain after third-quarter production report.", "description": "Shares in domestically-focussed UK companies slid on Wednesday while those on the blue-chip FTSE 100 inched higher as votes in parliament kept investors guessing on the final timing and shape of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.", "authors": ["Muvija M", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444028680&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0J6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
