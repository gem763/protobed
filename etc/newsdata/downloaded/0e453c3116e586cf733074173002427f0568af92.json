And to get one of those in the semifinals is big. To be able to gut it out is huge for us.\u201d\n\nMeesseman also bested her regular-season high of 25 for the Mystics, who were playing their first postseason game since being swept by the Seattle Storm in last year\u2019s WNBA Finals. Meesseman wasn\u2019t a part of that team, after taking a leave of absence following the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been preached at all year by her teammates and coaches that she\u2019s the missing piece from a year ago,\u201d Mystics coach Mike Thibault said.\n\nIn her first game in more than a month, Kristi Toliver added eight points, including a falling away, contested 3-pointer that stretched Washington\u2019s lead to 13 in the fourth quarter, an advantage that just barely held.\n\n\u201cKristi had some Kristi moments,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cThank God.\u201d\n\nA\u2019ja Wilson scored 23 points for Las Vegas, which twice got the deficit as close as two points in the final moments. Liz Cambage had 19 points and 12 rebounds, while Kayla McBride added 19 points.\n\nKelsey Plum had 16 points and nine assists, and missed a runner to force overtime two days after Dearica Hamby\u2019s 35-foot runner decided the Aces\u2019 93-92, second-round win over Chicago.\n\nAfter Toliver\u2019s 3 made it 92-79, the Aces scored nine straight points to close the deficit to four, while twice forcing the Mystics into a shot-clock violation with the ball in Delle Donne\u2019s hands.\n\nWilson\u2019s drive and layup closed it to 95-93 with 1:33 left, convincing Mystics coach Mike Thibault to call timeout. Following missesd on each end, Delle Donne\u2019s turnaround stretched the lead to four with 32 seconds to play.\n\n\u201cThey made some big shots tonight, I give them a lot of credit for that,\u201d Aces coach Bill Laimbeer said. \u201cThey made some shots down the stretch. The lulls that we had hurt us. And hopefully that was a learning experience.\u201d\n\nPlum answered with a layup. Then Delle Donne missed a jumper with the shot clock expiring as the Aces opted not to foul.\n\nPlum received an outlet pass and raced inside the arc, but her 20-footer wouldn\u2019t fall.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nAces: Shot 73.3 % (11 of 15) during the opening quarter but still trailed at the end, 30-27. \u2026 The series opener marked the Aces\u2019 first game in a WNBA semifinal series since making a run to the 2008 finals, when the team was located in San Antonio.\n\nMystics: Did not commit a turnover in the first quarter and committed only two by halftime \u2026 Toliver entered with 4:17 left in the first quarter to a standing ovation. It was her first action since Aug. 8 (knee bruise).\n\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nLaimbeer could not tell whether Plum was fouled on her final shotcont, but he was frustrated he wasn\u2019t granted a timeout to set up a play for a better look.\n\n\u201cI was standing next to the referee by design,\u201d Laimbeer said. \u201cAs soon as they missed the shot, I would be yelling \u2018Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!\u2019 \u2026 I yelled it five times. And she even looked at me as I was yelling and made a conscious decision not to call timeout. I do not understand why. I think the league should make a little bit of an investigation.\u201d\n\nREST OR RUST?\n\nWith their playoff double-bye, the Mystics were playing their first game in nine days. They were just 1-2 on five or more days\u2019 rest in the regular season. The fourth-seeded Aces also had a week to wait before their win Sunday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGame 2 of the best-of-five series is Thursday in Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Washington Mystics were thrilled to pull out a close win in the playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Quillen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/aces_mystics_basketball_16806_c0-163-3896-2434_s1770x1032.jpg?03b4f192261fba1cc58d08894a1f30750fac43dc", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
