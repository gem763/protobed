Yes, the Beyhive is out for blood after Homecoming: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9 lost out in all six categories it was nominated this year.\n\nHomecoming, which was released on Netflix in April, is a concert documentary capturing the lead-up to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s breathtaking 2018 Coachella performance. The film offers viewers a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the singer\u2019s creative process, combined with spectacular footage from the concert. At the Emmys ceremony on Saturday, Beyonc\u00e9 lost the directing honor to Springsteen on Broadway, production design for a variety special to Rent, outstanding writing to Hannah Gadsby\u2019s Nanette, music direction to Fosse/Verdon, and costume design to RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Fans were particularly incensed, however, that the concert film lost to James Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke in the Outstanding Variety Special category.\n\nTwitter users were quick to point out how much effort and planning went into Homecoming. One tweet, which has more than 100,000 likes, shows a video of cameramen navigating bleacher-like stairs and weaving between magenta-leotard-clad backup dancers to capture Queen Bey\u2019s complicated choreography. The accompanying comment read, \u201cjames cordens carpool karaoke just won best technical direction\u2026.a camera taped to a windshield just won an emmy over this.\u201d (While the name of the category was listed incorrectly in the tweet, many others also focused on the seeming disparities in technical production between the two programs.)\n\nThough Beyonc\u00e9 herself has not commented on the losses, her team is not afraid to let the world (and the Academy) know how they really feel. The megastar\u2019s publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, bid Emmys weekend farewell with a cheeky Instagram video of herself and several other team members flipping off the camera. On Sunday, Homecoming videographer Ben Hagarty weighed in on the backlash. He took to Twitter to share a three-second video from the film of a reunited Destiny\u2019s Child stomping in sync in matching glittery camouflage outfits.\n\nHagarty noted the intense technical difficulty of the production process. \u201cI held a heavy ass camera and walked backwards keeping these 3 legends in frame while dave held a carabiner on my pants to guide me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOh and I did it going down a set of stairs. RT if you would give us an Emmy at least.\u201d In a thread, he explained that he and another crew member had to establish a system to signal when the stage would turn so he wouldn\u2019t fall off the runway while walking backwards.\n\nWhen Homecoming premiered early this year to glowing reviews, it was celebrated as an astonishing tribute to the legacy of black music and the culture of HBCUs. Beyonc\u00e9 was joined onstage by an ensemble of steppers, dancers, and a marching band. Quotes from black artists and leaders punctuated concert footage. Crucially, the April 2018 Coachella performance marked the first time a black woman headlined the famous festival. The long-overdue set was so incredible that fans, at the urging of DJ Khaled, rebranded the Indio influencer-fest as \u201cBeychella\u201d in the weeks that followed.\n\nAs such, some saw the lack of recognition for the documentary in all of the categories as an example of media industry sexism and racism. \u201cThis is deeper than Beyonc\u00e9 losing the award,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s really telling how misogynistic and racist these people are.\u201d Another user wrote, \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 losing all 6 Emmy\u2019s for Homecoming and all 4 Emmy\u2019s for Lemonade makes me realize that as a black person, as a black woman even if you work 10 times harder, or delivered 10 times better you still won\u2019t get the recognition you deserve.\u201d Back in 2016, the music icon\u2019s visual album Lemonade lost the Outstanding Variety Special category to\u2014you guessed it\u2014James Corden\u2019s The Late Late Show Carpool Karaoke Primetime Special.\n\nNobody is denying that Carpool Karaoke is an original, delightful guilty pleasure that has provided us with pop culture gems like Cardi B serenading a Los Angeles senior center, Adele belting along to the Spice Girls, and Michelle Obama duetting with Missy Elliott. The Emmy-winning Paul McCartney episode was entertaining and often moving\u2014particularly, I imagine, for devoted Beatles fans. \u201cThe segment is probably one of the most extraordinary interviews with Paul McCartney ever done,\u201d wrote The Daily Beast\u2019s Tom Sykes, \u201ccombining poignant reflections on his life growing up in Liverpool with Corden and McCartney belting out classic tunes.\u201d\n\nBut, considering the technical achievement of Homecoming, which brought one of the most epic live performances of the century into peoples\u2019 living rooms, the cultural significance of the Beychella set, and the sheer star power of Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter, the loss certainly qualifies as an upset. As Taylor Hosking wrote for Vice, \u201cIt's unbelievable that she lost to James Corden doing anything, even if a Beatle was involved. The Beatles may have been more popular than Jesus, but now, Beyonc\u00e9 is more popular than the Beatles.\u201d", "description": "That she lost to James Corden\u2019s \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d only rubbed salt in the wound.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568671042/189585_lmbklb", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
