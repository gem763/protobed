And they said, 'You're not going to believe this but it's almost like they built this facility to host this type of event.'\"\n\nThe chief of staff said the event would be made available \"at cost\" and that using the Doral would save millions of dollars.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIs the president improperly profiting?\n\nEarlier this year the US president floated the idea of his Doral property hosting the G7. But the White House denied on Thursday he was availing himself of a branding opportunity.\n\n\"It's [Trump] the most recognisable name in the English language and probably around the world right now, so no, that has nothing to do with that,\" Mr Mulvaney said.\n\nMr Mulvaney added: \"Basically, he'd be criticised regardless of what he'd chose to do, but no there's no issue here on him profiting from this any way, shape or form.\"\n\nBut Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog, told AP news agency: \"The president is now officially using the power of his office to help prop up his struggling golf business.\"\n\nWhat will happen at the G7 summit?\n\nThe Group of Seven meeting, between Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and the US plus the EU, takes place between 10 and 12 June next year.\n\nMr Mulvaney said there were ongoing discussions about whether Mr Trump would invite Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussia was excluded from G7 for annexing Crimea in 2014, but Mr Trump has suggested it would be better to have Russia at the table.\n\nClimate change will not be on the agenda at the summit, the chief of staff added.\n\nHe said it would focus on \"challenges to the global economy\".\n\nPar for the course\n\nNever mind that Donald Trump has been repeatedly accused of steering government dollars to benefit his business interests. Never mind that the acting White House chief of staff said the president personally suggested Doral as a possible site.\n\nNever mind that the president has accused Democrat Joe Biden's family of personally profiting from US government actions. Never mind that hosting anything in hot, muggy south Florida in June is a questionable idea.\n\nMr Mulvaney said the summit will be provided \"at cost\", so Mr Trump will not personally profit from Doral's selection. Even a break-even event on a Trump property is a boon for the business, however, in terms of publicity and the fact that full hotel rooms and resort facilities making break-even revenue is better than empty ones bringing in no money.\n\nMr Trump will push ahead with this plan, regardless of the howls of outrage from his critics - as he has time and time again during his presidency.\n\nWhat is the Trump National Doral?\n\nThe 800-acre resort boasts five golf courses, 700 hotel rooms, a spa, conference rooms and shops.\n\nLocated about eight miles (13 km) from Miami's airport, the property was acquired by Mr Trump out of bankruptcy in 2012.\n\nAccording to its website, the Doral has several ballrooms, one named after the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported in May that the Doral had been \"severely under-performing\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIs this a conflict of interest?\n\nMr Mulvaney denied hosting the summit would breach the Emoluments Clause of the US constitution, which prohibits any \"profit, gain, or advantage\" from political office.\n\nWhen he became president, Mr Trump stepped down from running his company, handing over the reins of the real estate empire to his sons, but he still retains ownership of the business.\n\nPresident Trump has been criticised for visiting his golf clubs across the US and abroad - he stayed at his luxury resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, after a state visit to the UK this year.\n\nThe president's critics say his ownership of these properties is a conflict of interest and argue it is unethical that Mr Trump could derive any profits during his presidency.\n\nIn July, a federal appeals court rejected a case that argued Mr Trump was unconstitutionally profiting through his hotel in the nation's capital, near the White House.", "description": "The Doral Miami resort will host the summit but the president will not profit, the White House says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rb8hq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
