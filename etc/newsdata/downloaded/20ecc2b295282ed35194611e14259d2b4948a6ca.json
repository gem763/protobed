The outage could last for up to five days.\n\n\u201cThis is a last resort,\u201d Sumeet Singh, head of PG&E\u2019s Community Wildfire Safety Program, said at a Tuesday night press conference.\n\nBut even to state leaders, the drastic solution is a response to a problem of PG&E\u2019s own making.\n\nA widespread power shutoff like this \u201cis not how things should work in the industry,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told reporters Tuesday.\n\n\u201cNone of us are happy about this,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have an antiquated system at PG&E that needs to be upgraded.\u201d\n\nMillions of California residents are being affected this week as other utility companies follow suit, but none have come under quite the same scrutiny as PG&E.\n\nSome of the state\u2019s worst wildfires in recent years were sparked by PG&E\u2019s power lines, often when they come into contact with nearby tree branches. Last year\u2019s deadly Camp fire, the worst in California\u2019s modern history, is among those instances.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Newsom, who assumed office this year, has gone off on PG&E.\n\nNone of us are happy about this. Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\n\u201cThey have simply been caught red-handed over and over again, lying, manipulating or misleading the public,\u201d he told The New York Times in March. \u201cThey cannot be trusted.\u201d\n\nPG&E has been under nearly nonstop investigation for the past decade for wildfires linked to the company violating safety rules, such as poor record-keeping on malfunctioning equipment. Time and again, state regulators have found that PG&E violated state laws when it comes to keeping its equipment safe, especially given the tinder dry conditions California has endured in recent years.\n\nJust last week, the company agreed to pay a $5 million penalty to the state and spend $60 million on improving its \u201clocate and mark\u201d safety program intended to prevent explosions when digging near underground utility facilities.\n\nAnd last month, PG&E agreed to pay out $11 billion to a group of insurance companies representing people affected by the swarm of deadly fires in 2017 and 2018.\n\nEnvironmental groups, meanwhile, say the forced power outage is a grim reminder that California, a state suffering from so many climate-change-related disasters, needs to invest in cleaner, safer energy infrastructure.\n\n\u201cTurning out the lights for weeks at a time will become the new normal for California residents unless the state takes action to build a more sustainable energy system,\u201d Alexandra Nagy, the California director of Food & Water Action, said.\n\n\u201cDistributed generation from clean, renewable energy and storage can help reduce reliance on large scale distribution lines and increase reliability,\u201d she added, \u201cnot to mention the added benefits of cleaner air, a more stable climate, and lower energy costs associated with clean, renewable energy.\u201d", "description": "This \u201cis not how things should work,\" Gov.
