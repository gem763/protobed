Christopher Hasson to move ahead over accusations of plotting terror attack", "language": "en", "text": "U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel denied the request to dismiss the charges Friday, almost two weeks after hearing arguments on the defense request.\n\nHasson, 50, of the Silver Spring area, was arrested in February after federal authorities suspected him of stockpiling weapons and studying terrorist manifestos, including on his work computer, to launch an attack on U.S. politicians and journalists. Federal prosecutors accuse him of developing a list of enemies to target and studying their locations as part of a \u201cmass casualty event\u201d driven by his white-supremacist views.\n\nArrests in domestic terror probes outpace those inspired by Islamic extremists\n\nHasson, who faces no terrorism-related offenses, has pleaded not guilty to two counts related to unlawful possession of firearms silencers, a count of possession of firearms by an unlawful drug user and possession of a controlled substance. He is scheduled for a six-day trial starting Oct. 21.\n\nThe federal public defenders representing Hasson had argued that the silencer charges should be dropped because silencers are considered arms for Second Amendment purposes.\n\nThough silencers do not fire ammunition on their own, owning them protects gun users\u2019 hearing and health, making them indispensible to exercising the right to use a gun, the defense team argued. As an example, they cited another court\u2019s finding that although firing ranges are not exactly arms, they are protected under the Second Amendment because they allow people to safely and effectively use firearms.\n\n\u201cSilencers receive the explicit protection of the Second Amendment because they constitute \u201carms\u201d (or accessories to arms),\u201d assistant federal public defenders Liz Oyer and Cullen Macbeth wrote in court filings. \u201cAnd even if they did not, silencers would still fall within the scope of the Second Amendment\u2019s implicit guarantee because their use is indispensable to exercise of the core second Amendment right, i.e., the use of a gun for self-defense in the home.\u201d\n\nThe government argued that silencers do not explicitly receive Second Amendment protection because they are not \u201cbearable arms\u201d or \u201cintegral to the operation of any gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn parenting parlance, silencers might be a \u2018nice to have,\u2019 but they are not a \u2018need to have,\u2019\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Windom wrote in filings. \u201cA gun \u2014 every gun \u2014 works perfectly well without a silencer. For that simple reason, silencers are not firearms within the meaning of the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nIn his written opinion, Hazel said a silencer is not an \u201carm\u201d or \u201cweapon\u201d because it would not be useful on its own in a confrontation and therefore is not protected by the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cA silencer is not itself used \u2018to cast at or strike another,\u2019 it does not contain, feed, or project ammunition, and it does not serve any intrinsic self-defense purpose,\u201d Hazel wrote in agreement with other courts that have opined on the matter.\n\nInnocent man spent months in jail for bringing honey back to United States\n\nA child touched an electrified railing at MGM National Harbor resort, and lives changed\n\nProsecutors in Prince George\u2019s will no longer recommend cash bail for defendants\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Public defenders for Lt.
