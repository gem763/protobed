But he had no intention of leaving out a player who is quickly establishing himself as a key man.\n\nVunipola powered over the line for the second try of the game and carried and tackled with typical authority. And he was withdrawn after a dominant first-half performance, saved for the tougher tests to come.\n\nThe signs are good for England\u2019s number eight, who looks set for a successful World Cup.\n\n3) England still lacking a little fluidity\n\nThis, like the opening game against Tonga, was an efficient, industrious victory. Jones highlighted the importance of starting fast in the build-up, and that is what England did: George Ford surged into a gap and scored the first try inside six minutes.\n\nFor all of England\u2019s dominance, though, there was perhaps a lack of subtlety in attack, a lack of the fluidity that may be required to break through against better opposition. Things improved after the break, though, as the US tired and more spaces appeared.\n\nThis was a comfortable, accomplished win, and there are plenty of positives to take from it. But there remains a feeling that there is more to come from this England side.\n\n4) Battling USA won't be easy opposition\n\nThey were well beaten here, as many expected, but the US might yet prove a thorn in the side of Pool C\u2019s other fancied teams, France and Argentina.\n\nGold\u2019s side kept things relatively tight in the first half against England, restricting the favourites well and preventing them from settling into any sort of rhythm.\n\nUnderstandably, they struggled to contain England as the game progressed. But the US showed enough to suggest they could at least give France and Argentina a game.\n\n5) Solid defence gives England foundation for success\n\nEngland , before Bryce Campbell's late effort, had gone 280 minutes of rugby without conceding a try. And the US, for all their hard work, did almost nothing to trouble a supremely disciplined, organised defence. It was a typically structured display from Jones\u2019 side, one that will give them confidence heading into the latter stages of the competition.\n\nEven the best teams, you feel, will find it difficult to score freely against England. There are sterner tests to come, of course \u2013 France and Argentina will provide a clearer indication as to where England are at \u2013 but their work at the back and without the ball in this tournament thus far has been impressive.", "description": "1)\u00a0England have too much power for unfancied opponents As against Tonga, England simply had too much brute force for the USA.
