But it wasn\u2019t until the International Swimming League ISL started really falling into place, that she thought: \u201cWow, this is really happening.\u201d And then she instantly decided: \u201cI have to be a part of this.\u201d\n\nThe five-time Olympic champion knows about the special feeling of competing for a team, having swum Stanford University to its first NCAA Championship team title since 1989 in her freshman year. A successful Stanford Cardinal repeated in Ledecky\u2019s sophomore year before the 22-year-old turned pro in 2018.\n\n\u201cI really enjoyed competing with my Stanford teammates and I kind of missed being a part of a team.\u201d All the more reason, she said, to join the ISL. \u201cThis is just an awesome opportunity; you have team members from all over the world. You get to know so many new people, different backgrounds, this really brings kind of a deeper connection to the sport.\u201d Ledecky, already decorated with five Olympic gold medals and 15 world titles is certain: \u201cCompeting for a team does bring out the very best in you.\u201d\n\nStill \u2013 for Ledecky, who also serves as an ISL ambassador, it is not only about the team: \u201cThe ISL emphasizes gender equality \u2013 on every level. Equal number of men and women within each team, equal pay, and competing for the same prize money. That is something that sets us apart from other sports.\u201d And Ledecky\u2019s team even took another historical step: DC Trident is led by an all-female coaching staff.\n\nWith all that in mind, Ledecky is \u201creally excited to get this started,\u201d she said 24 hours before the long-awaited kick-off.\n\nAfter Indianapolis Katie Ledecky will not be competing with DC Trident in Naples and Maryland, she said. \u201cI had already set my training blocks for this season before I joined the ISL, so unfortunately, I will not be able to compete for my team on the next two stops.\u201d She would be back for the final, though, if her DC Trident team qualifies and is prepared to give it everything she got to get the team in a good position after Indianapolis.\n\nGiven that this is an Olympic season, the highly decorated Olympic Gold Medalist could have said: Great idea, ISL, but let\u2019s just start next year. But that was never an option for the world-record-holder. \u201cI really wanted to be there for the start\u201d, Ledecky said. \u201cI am really excited to be a part of history\u201d.\n\nAbout the ISL: The International Swimming League is a global professional swimming competition launching in 2019 with teams in both Europe (Italy-based Aqua Centurions, France-based Energy Standard, Hungary-based Iron, and London Roar) and the United States (Cali Condors, DC Trident, LA Current, NY Breakers). The inaugural season will include matches in Indianapolis IN, Naples ITA, Lewisville TX, Budapest HUN, College Park MD, London GBR, and the championship finale at the 12,000-seat Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, NV. The ISL aims to create groundbreaking projects, in both form and content, exploring the full potential of competitive swimming while securing sustainable commercial growth in the sport.\n\nISL SOCIAL: Keep up with all the latest ISL news by following @iswimleague on Instagram and Twitter and @internationalswimmingleague on Facebook.
