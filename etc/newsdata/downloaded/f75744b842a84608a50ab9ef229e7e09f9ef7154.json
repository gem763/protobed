That is disgusting! I'd definitely complain.'\n\nSpeaking today, Ms Quirk added: 'I couldn't get it out, I literally had to turn the bin upside down, all the bin juice was all over it.\n\n'I put my dog poop in that bin, I wouldn't want my food in there. It makes me feel like I wouldn't want them to deliver anything ever again.'\n\nCarl Moore, chief operations officer at Yodel, said: 'The safe delivery of parcels is our priority and we have been in touch with Mr Quirk to apologise for the service he received on this occasion.\n\n'Due to the perishable nature of this delivery, the parcel needed to be delivered on the day and when no one answered at the recipient's address or neighbouring houses, the driver tried to find a safe place to leave the parcel. Clearly a wheelie bin is not appropriate and we are taking measures to ensure this doesn't happen again.\n\n'We work closely with our retail clients and encourage them to give customers the opportunity to advise us where they would like their deliveries left if they are not in to receive them.'", "description": "Carla Quirk, 35, returned home to find her Musclefood order had been delivered by a Yodel driver and thrown in the bin outside her property in Workington, Cumbria.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/19833354-0-image-a-18_1571311130754.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
