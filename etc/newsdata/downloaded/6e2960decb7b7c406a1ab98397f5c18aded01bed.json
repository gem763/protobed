What began as a pun-filled send-up of celebrity culture and the media circus, set in a world full of anthropomorphic animals, soon presented a nuanced take on mental illness and the cycles of trauma. Before long, series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg was turning this critical eye to his own perceived failings.\n\nFrom the start, BoJack Horseman was always introspective and prone to putting its characters\u2019 behavior under the microscope. But as the series progressed, the scrutiny became far more intense. Bob-Waksberg eventually turned the show toward examining its own cultural impact, even questioning his desire to self-evaluate. The sixth season, which launched on Netflix on October 25th, continues this pattern of criticism, as the series\u2019s protagonist, depressed former sitcom star BoJack Horseman (Will Arnett) begins his own journey to recovery, interrogating his behavioral patterns and revisiting trauma sites. More so than any fan or commentator, the show holds the top spot as its own harshest critic.\n\nBoJack longs for a life as simple as the one in his former hit sitcom Horsin\u2019 Around, where every conflict was resolved in one episode, so everything could reset again. From the beginning, the series made it clear that this fantasy was incompatible with reality, and that BoJack\u2019s refusal to deal with his problems was only going to make things worse. Although Bob-Waksberg set out to subvert viewer expectations, this subversion soon became routine. One woman BoJack dates even highlights this trend by asking him to \u201cdo that BoJack thing where you make a big deal over nothing and everyone laughs at you but at the same time relates, because you\u2019re saying all the things polite society won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFor the first few seasons, the show has its cake and eats it, too. Bob-Waksberg mines BoJack Horseman\u2019s sitcom status for all its absurd comedy, such as BoJack\u2019s best friend Todd (Aaron Paul) landing himself in a \u201ctwo-dates-to-the-prom\u201d situation with rival prison gangs. At other times, the show emphasizes that life rarely fits this structure, such as when BoJack\u2019s former friend and Horsin\u2019 Around creator Herb (Stanley Tucci) rejects BoJack\u2019s heartfelt apology, even on his deathbed. The series brings in sitcom tropes and structure to mock them, but also to seriously reflect BoJack\u2019s damaged psyche.\n\nBut from the second season onward, the writers became increasingly aware of their complicity in the sitcom-reset fantasy, and they worked harder to keep their stories from growing stagnant. The show started taking BoJack\u2019s bad behavior to darker corners with plots where he\u2019s caught with a friend\u2019s 17-year-old daughter and a reckless drug-fueled bender with Sarah Lynn (Kristen Schaal), a former Horsin\u2019 Around child actress who had gotten clean and sober. In the season 4 episode \u201cThe Old Sugarman Place,\u201d he demolishes his family home in an attempt to \u201cmove forward\u201d and return to Los Angeles. This forceful return to the status quo also reflected BoJack\u2019s cycle of delusion and entitlement, as well as his inability to pull himself free from the quagmire of depression.\n\nDealing with thorny topics like trauma, privilege, mental illness, harassment, and substance abuse isn\u2019t easy, especially when they have to be balanced with animal puns and goofy antics. (\u201cViva Toddfoolery!\u201d) The writers frequently use comedy to provide catharsis amid tension or tragedy, with Todd getting into a Prince and the Pauper caper in the same episode where feminist writer Diane (Alison Brie) faces the fallout of speaking out on sexual misconduct. But the creative team eventually cornered themselves by calling out the incompatibility between real life and sitcom structure, given that they\u2019d set up a scenario where they needed sitcom structure to tell their stories.\n\nBy the third season, the episodic cycles of BoJack\u2019s toxic, damaging behavior ran the risk of becoming repetitive and predictable. But the writers acknowledged the problem, with Todd calling out BoJack in the season 3 episode \u201cIt\u2019s You\u201d: \u201cYou can\u2019t keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself as if that makes it okay \u2014 you need to be better!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t just Todd pushing back against a friend who is all too ready to be forgiven. It\u2019s the writers examining the impact of their show. It\u2019s one thing to derive comedy from BoJack\u2019s misanthropy, but allowing it to go unchallenged sets a dangerous precedent. Rather than shying away from the question, the creative team wrestled with their purpose as the series progressed. When BoJack plays gritty anti-hero detective Philbert in season 5, Diane questions whether such ultra-dark characters have a negative influence on the viewer. By extension, she\u2019s implicating BoJack\u2019s role within BoJack Horseman, and his effect on the Netflix viewership.\n\nIn season 1\u2019s penultimate episode, BoJack asks Diane whether he\u2019s a good person, and she answers with crushing silence. While she later tries to explain that no one is truly good or bad, and that \u201call you are is just the things that you do,\u201d he still seeks to purge himself of the guilt he feels. Following his toxic mantra, \u201cThere\u2019s always more show,\u201d and taking some damaging advice that he should \u201ckeep running forward, no matter what,\u201d BoJack avoids confronting his problems and insists he isn\u2019t going to change. He sees Philbert \u2014 who he and Diane both helped bring to the screen \u2014 as a role model, playing into Diane\u2019s fear that Philbert allows \u201cdumb assholes to rationalize their own awful behavior.\u201d\n\nBoJack explains in the season 5 episode \u201cHead in the Clouds\u201d that Philbert teaches \u201cWe\u2019re all terrible, so we\u2019re all okay.\u201d Diane, who is already struggling with her part in creating the show, is horrified by this interpretation, and points out that normalizing and rationalizing harmful behavior is dangerous. During this conversation, the show reaches one of its darkest and most self-critical points by bringing up BoJack\u2019s relationship with Sarah Lynn. She saw him as a father figure even into her adult life as a pop star, but that became complicated when their relationship later turned sexual.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who has suffered the most because of the actions of BoJack Horseman,\u201d he argues. Diane raises his unquestionable negative effect on Sarah Lynn as proof he\u2019s wrong. \u201cThat\u2019s been really hard for you, the main character in this story,\u201d she says sarcastically. In one of its most merciless scenes, the writers reflect on their choice to empathize with a character like BoJack. They also seem to lament how they initially played BoJack\u2019s sexual encounter with Sarah Lynn as a gag, and questions the cultural norms they were reinforcing.\n\nDiane isn\u2019t free from criticism, either. She\u2019s often the show\u2019s moral arbiter and its voice of reason, but she subjects herself to severe scrutiny, representing the show\u2019s impulse to endlessly dissect its characters. Diane suggests we should be \u201casking more of ourselves and the people in our lives,\u201d but she\u2019s told she should also find ways to forgive herself and other people. BoJack Horseman is constantly striving for that balance.\n\nPart of Diane\u2019s self-examination may be inspired by the controversy surrounding her casting. Diane is Vietnamese-American, but she\u2019s played by Caucasian actress Alison Brie. After a fan brought up the issue on Twitter, Bob-Waksberg confessed he\u2019d \u201csoured on the idea of \u2018color-blind\u2019 casting as an excuse to not pay attention.\u201d He later gave a candid interview with Slate where he expressed \u201ctremendous guilt\u201d over the casting, and said his \u201cunderstanding of [his] own responsibility\u201d had changed. The same humble and honest outlook on guilt and responsibility underlies much of the show, especially in its later seasons. It\u2019s notable that season 6 takes the time to answer fan speculation over the ethnic identity of Todd, a Caucasian character with a Latinx surname, as if leaving no stone unturned.\n\nThe newly released first half of season 6 takes BoJack to rehab, in a recovery process that isn\u2019t just about dealing with addiction, but about questioning the realities of forgiveness and personal change. Even the new opening credits see him passing through past regrets that still linger and threaten his future. A frequent refrain of the show brings together BoJack, seeing himself as a \u201cstupid piece of shit,\u201d and Diane, seeing herself as a \u201crudderless garbage barge.\u201d They\u2019re both trying their best to forgive each other because they can\u2019t extend that same courtesy to themselves.\n\nBoJack Horseman often explores questions of forgiveness, both between people and between stars and their fans. We may find it easier to forgive BoJack\u2019s mistakes than the unrepentant misogyny Hank Hippopopalous (Philip Baker Hall) exhibits in \u201cHank After Dark,\u201d but the series has long since outgrown any simple ideas of heroes and villains. Secondary characters like Mr. Peanut Butter and Princess Carolyn \u2014 who initially served as counterpoints to BoJack\u2019s pessimism and immaturity, respectively \u2014 become deeply flawed characters in their own right. Meanwhile, loathsome antagonists like Vanessa Gekko and Rutabaga Rabitowitz were revealed as the protagonists of their own stories.\n\nAs the show heads toward its finale, it\u2019s still exploring that question BoJack asks Diane in season 1: is he a good person at heart, or is it too late for him? The sixth season shows that change is possible for BoJack, as he begins to make amends for the things he\u2019s done, face addiction, and try to forgive himself. The self-examination that has taken place both within the story and in the writing room has demonstrated a maturity capable of tackling such broad and complicated issues. Rather than providing simple platitudes, the series brings its characters together through empathy rather than sympathy, and honesty over blind faith. Being its own harshest critic has let BoJack Horseman evolve, and be the best version of itself.", "description": "The sixth and final season season continues a series-long trend toward ruthless self-examination, which has pushed BoJack Horseman in consistently darker, smarter, and more self-aware directions.", "authors": ["Jack Godwin", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d8gddPyUvlC-Ta8wWlfUz8WZSRE=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19325970/BoJack_Horseman_S06E01_12m1s17305f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
