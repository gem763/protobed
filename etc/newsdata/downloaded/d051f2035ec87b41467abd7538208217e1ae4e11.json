He supported SEAL and Special Warfare teams throughout his career and many friends died in combat.\n\nOn the eve of his retirement, Sherman decided he wanted more people to be able to honor the incredible heroes of this nation who gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nFORMER NAVY SEAL, 52, WHO WAS WOUNDED IN BERGDAHL MISSION, HEADS TO YALE AS A FRESHMAN\n\nSherman\u2019s singular yet powerful mission: telling the stories of fallen service members through the voices of Gold Star families, those who have lost loved ones through military service. For them, \u201cthe grief never ends,\u201d Sherman said.\n\n\u201cI was going to retire in San Diego and drive back to Massachusetts and stop by the hometowns of fallen service members that I had served with and share some memories with their Gold Star families that maybe they had not heard before,\u201d Sherman told Fox News.\n\nFor the past year, Sherman has traveled across the nation documenting stories of Gold Star families from each of the 50 states, tenderly gathering tributes and stories of the families' loved ones. While his project started humbly, Gold Star Dirt became a nonprofit last August, and Sherman has traveled to nearly every state, logging over 43,000 miles.\n\nHe had seven states left as of Wednesday night \u2013 Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts, Oregon, Utah and Washington, with plans to drive to Utah on Thursday. Sherman said he will fly from Hawaii to Massachusetts for his symbolic last visit, as that\u2019s where he entered the military.\n\nHe was preparing for a three-month inpatient treatment program for post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, before he retired, when he decided to start collecting stories.\n\nSherman lost friends to suicide related to PTSD, including one who confided in him but asked him not to share for fear of losing his security clearance. His friend later killed himself, Sherman said.\n\nAfter struggling with guilt and regret, and after another friend shared his own battles with the same issues and how he could get help, Sherman was diagnosed with PTSD and an MRI revealed he had 12 traumatic brain injury-related lesions.\n\nAs he prepared for retirement, his purpose became clear, and he wanted to document Gold Star families' stories on behalf of the nation, Sherman said.\n\nJust about every story could bring tears to people's eyes.\n\n\u201cI feel the weight deeply during and after each interview. I can't count the number of times that I have shed tears right along with the family. They are pouring their hearts out right in front of me, someone that they don't even know,\u201d Sherman said.\n\n\u201cI feel the weight deeply during and after each interview. I can't count the number of times that I have shed tears right along with the family. They are pouring their hearts out right in front of me, someone that they don't even know.\u201d \u2014 Keith Sherman\n\nHe recalled a young woman in Montana, Rheanna Tanner, who said it was \u201clove at first sight\u201d with her Marine husband Cpl. John Cory Tanner. The two married and she got pregnant at 18. John Tanner deployed to Iraq when his wife was four months pregnant. An IED killed him when she was nine months pregnant.\n\n\"Rheanna buried her husband and three days later gave birth to their son, [whom] he never got to meet,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cRheanna said that in all of that pain, anguish and turmoil, and being 19 and a widow, giving birth to their child was the best part of her young life.\u201d\n\nWhen he started the project, Sherman started a Gold Star Dirt Facebook page, the \u201cdirt\u201d referring to his love of dirt bikes and the intended mode of transportation for his road trip. While he decided to drive a car, he has continued to travel with his dirt bike, along with a pop-up tent.\n\nOnce he established an online presence, Sherman connected with a Gold Star sibling whose brother died in Iraq. Kristine Flores, a TV producer in San Jose, Calif., has been producing the project, contacting the Gold Star families and lining up interviews.\n\nThe Library of Congress also spotted the Gold Star Dirt and reached out to see if Sherman knew about the Gold Star Family Voice Act, which expanded the Veterans History Project mandate to audio and video first-person interviews.\n\nIt turned out the Library of Congress was in search of the stories Sherman wanted to tell.\n\n\u201cThere it was \u2013 now the mission had purpose and scope,\u201d he said.\n\nSherman said he started to prepare for his mission and plan his travel route.\n\n\u201cMy thought process for the route came out of trying to skip the northern winter in the United States. I drew a line across the nation and figured that by the time I visited the southern states, met and documented the family stories and hit the East Coast, the northern winter would be mostly over,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cI was worried about the winter, as I would be camping my way across the nation using my rooftop tent. I figured that this way I could keep expenses low as I don't have any funding, only my retirement, and disability from my military retirement,\u201d Sherman said.\n\nCHICK-FIL-A MAKES 500 SANDWICHES FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AFTER TEXAS SHOOTING SPREE\n\nNow, a year later, with his project nearing completion, Sherman has submitted 20 states\u2019 worth of stories so far.\n\nThe Library of Congress has confirmed a donation ceremony date for Nov. 1 at 10 a.m., and every Gold Star family that has participated in the project will be invited to see their loved one\u2019s story be donated into the National Archives, Sherman said.\n\nHe said he would reach out to members of Congress in the families\u2019 districts to invite them to the ceremony as well, and also wanted to invite philanthropic groups to donate so the families wouldn\u2019t have to pay for travel expenses to attend the ceremony.\n\nDown the road, the Library of Congress is expected to make the interviews available to view online, but Sherman noted that the process would take time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI have been putting together small-form pieces while on the road and releasing them on our social media when I can. The response has really been amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many want to hear these stories of love, honor and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cRight now, I just need to focus on finishing this project to the best of my ability and in a manner that is in line with the kindness, love and honor that all these families have shown me.\u201d", "description": "Keith Sherman served in the U.S. Navy for 26\u00a0years and retired in October as a senior chief petty officer.
