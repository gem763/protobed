REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe disclosure raises questions over whether crew members, who told investigators they tried desperately to rescue the passengers in their below-decks sleeping quarters, were already too late to save them by the time they were alerted to the blaze.\n\nDivers have so far recovered the burned remains of 33 victims, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told a news conference. Crews hoped to find the final body when the 75-foot (23-metre) Conception was raised from the floor of the Pacific Ocean as early as Friday.\n\n\u201cWe will continue working tenaciously to recover all the victims, to determine how they died and investigate the cause of this terrible fire and loss of life with the hope that future such tragedies can be prevented,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe Conception erupted in flames at about 3:15 a.m. (1015 GMT) on Monday off Santa Cruz Island, killing 33 passengers and a crew member in one of California\u2019s worst maritime disasters.\n\nThe five surviving crew members, who were above deck when the fire broke out, have told investigators the flames kept them from climbing down a narrow ladder into the bunk room or gaining access through a window.\n\nA coroner\u2019s pathologist was \u201cconvinced\u201d the victims died due to smoke inhalation, Brown said, but his analysis was considered preliminary pending toxicology tests.\n\nThe sheriff stopped short of saying the findings meant the crew\u2019s efforts would have been too late to save the victims, cautioning that more investigation was required.\n\nFAMILIES IN SINGAPORE, JAPAN\n\nOfficials have decided against conducting autopsies on the victims, a move aimed at more quickly releasing the remains to family members, some of whom had travelled to California from as far away as India.\n\nThe coroner\u2019s office has identified 18 of the recovered bodies and officials released the names of nine victims, saying the rest awaited notifications of next of kin, who have been asked to provide DNA samples.\n\nThe FBI had been assisting in contacting loved ones of the dead. One victim\u2019s mother was notified in Japan and another family was found in Singapore, Brown said.\n\nThe passengers had signed up for a three-day scuba diving trip aboard the Conception, and were sleeping below deck along with one crew member when the fire erupted. That crew member, who perished in the accident, was identified on Friday as 26-year-old Alexandra Kurtz.\n\nThe eight deceased passengers whose names were released on Friday were: Raymond \u201cScott\u201d Chan, 59; Justin Carroll Dignam, 58; Daniel Garcia, 46; Marybeth Guiney, 51; Yulia Krashennaya, 40; Caroline McLaughlin, 35; Ted Strom, 62; and Wei Tan, 26.\n\nThe owner of the dive ship, Truth Aquatics, filed a petition in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday seeking to avoid liability in the incident by invoking a 19th-century law that has been used in such disasters as the 1915 sinking of the Titanic.[nL2N25X0ED]\n\nThat action appears to be pre-emptive as no lawsuits have yet been filed against Truth Aquatics over the accident.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe Los Angeles Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that investigators had already found safety issues on the Conception, including the lack of a night watchman who was assigned to be on duty while the rest of the crew and passengers were sleeping.\n\nOfficials declined to comment on that report at the news briefing, but U.S. Coast Guard Captain Monica Rochester confirmed that a night watchman or \u201crover\u201d was stipulated by the boat\u2019s inspection certificate.\n\nThe Conception, which rests upside down on the ocean floor some 65 feet (20 meters) below the surface, could be raised as early as Friday depending on weather conditions, Rochester said.", "description": "The 34 people killed when a dive boat caught fire and sank off the California coast likely died from smoke inhalation and may have been dead before flames consumed their bunk area, the local sheriff said on Friday.", "authors": ["Dan Whitcomb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427012401&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851Q8", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
