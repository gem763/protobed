He was two years into his first real job out college. He was enjoying trips with his girlfriend, nights out with his friends and a swanky 2004 Cadillac CTSV GM, +0.77% for weekend excursions.\n\n\u2018Am I doing the things I need to do to live the life I say I want to live? \u2026 I realized I was looking good losing.\u2019 Duron Chandler\n\nHe was also approximately $70,000 in debt, struggling with his weight and buying a car he probably couldn\u2019t afford. So he went for a drive in his comfy 1996 Toyota Tercel TM, +1.20% ride to clear his mind when he listened to Little Brother\u2019s song, \u201cDreams.\u201d And then he heard it: \u201cYou got to ask yourself do you really want to win, or just look good losin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat line jumped out of the radio into my head when he said it,\u201d Chandler, 37, told MarketWatch. \u201cAm I doing the things I need to do to live the life I say I want to live? \u2026 I realized I was looking good losing.\u201d\n\nChandler\u2019s been on a new financial road ever since. He\u2019s gone from debt to at least $120,000 in savings and investments.\n\n\u201cPart of my goal is to leave a legacy of money, wealth and knowledge for my friends, family and community,\u201d Chandler, a project manager at Cisco CSCO, +0.97%, said. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get to my end of days and not help anybody out.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Duron Chandler Duron Chandler, who took a new financial path after hearing one song.\n\nEnjoying life?\n\nChandler\u2019s father was an elementary-school teacher who drove a newspaper truck at night. \u201cThe angst that was there in the household was about money,\u201d said Chandler. \u201cIn my head, I automatically thought if I fix the money problems I won\u2019t have too many problems in my life.\u201d\n\nChandler wanted a side job growing up, but his father said he had to focus on school and sports instead.\n\n\u2018I started to wonder what could I do with that money.\u2019\n\nHe graduated from North Carolina A&T State University in 2005, majoring in industrial engineering. Chandler emerged with almost $60,000 of student debt. He secured a job with Northrop Grumman NOC, -0.22% as a project scheduler in 2009; by then, some of his school friends already had well-paying jobs and were living it up with trips and nights out.\n\nHe moved out of his parents\u2019 place and bought his Cadillac for $23,000, though he held onto the Toyota Tercel. He spent money going out on weekends, taking trips to the beach with his girlfriend, Anjelica, and basketball tickets to see the Washington D.C. Wizards.\n\nSee also: How one family went from being $55,000 in debt to saving $350,000 \u2014 \u2018the fun money really allows us spend on junk\u2019\n\n\u201cAt that point, I\u2019m enjoying life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe feeling didn\u2019t last.\n\nChandler was earning about $2,500 to $2,800 a month in take-home pay, but student loans and car payments sucked up around $800 of the paycheck.\n\n\u201cI started to wonder what could I do with that money,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that was when Chandler took his fateful drive and put on \u201cDreams.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Duron Chandler Duron Chandler\u2019s trusty 1996 Toyota Tercel.\n\nRewriting the budget\n\nTwo weeks after his fateful drive, Chandler contacted a college buddy with whom he traded business magazines. They talked about his situation and Chandler passed along his budget.\n\n\u201cYou got a lot of extra money in your budget, you just don\u2019t recognize it,\u201d the friend told Chandler.\n\nChandler cut off the cable, decided he\u2019d only go on one yearly trip and scaled down his night-life spending \u2014 just Friday nights out, not Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Once 40 pounds overweight, Chandler started exercising and cutting his meal portions.\n\nAround that time, he took a new job in Gaithersburg, Md. \u201cThat\u2019s where we really tied down the budget,\u201d he said.\n\nChandler and Anjelica, who he would later marry, furnished the living room with a computer chair and a papasan chair from Target TGT, +1.70%. That\u2019s it. He used a night stand for his 27-inch flat screen television, and brought along his mattress from college. \u201cWe made a conscious decision not to buy anything,\u201d he said.\n\nChandler spent $100 on groceries a week and earmarked $100 for weekend food. He doubled his car payments to $800, focusing on the Cadillac. He did this to build momentum against his debts and own the vehicle and sell it before too much depreciation.\n\nChandler sold the Cadillac in 2014 for $17,000.\n\nHe then set his sights on the student loans.\n\nChandler used his Cadillac sale proceeds to pay off his Sallie Mae SLM, +1.11% loans, which had the highest interest rate of over 14%. He took second job selling Bose speakers, home theater systems and headphones at a nearby mall. The second salary went straight to the student loans.\n\nChandler paid off his loans in 2015 and still has the letter informing him he was free and clear of debt. He\u2019s been thinking about framing the paper, he noted.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: A billionaire\u2019s pledge to pay off these Morehouse students\u2019 debt will affect more than their finances\n\nBuilding a legacy\n\nChandler kept the Bose job for several years, building up savings and investments. He stopped in the fall of 2018 to spend more time at home as he became a new father.\n\nChandler now earns around $4,500 in monthly take home pay and 43% is wrapped up in contributions to various retirement accounts, life-insurance policies and real-estate investments. Chandler now has $120,000 in savings and investments, but that doesn\u2019t include real-estate projections, he said.\n\nHe also started tracking his charitable contributions this year. So far in 2019, Chandler said he has donated $1,000, with most going to the Richmond Minorities in Engineering Partnership. Program services include summer camps exposing minority students to the engineering field. Chandler participated in it as a high-school student and is now a board member.\n\nChandler now practices \u2018selective extravagance\u2019 to buy what makes him \u2018happy on the inside.\u2019\n\nChandler practices what he calls \u201cselective extravagance.\u201d That\u2019s why he spent $3,000 on a road bike and recently traveled to Europe. He said he only splurges on \u201cthe thing I know are going to make me happy on the inside.\u201d\n\nHe still drives the Tercel, which is approaching 340,000 miles. The color used to be a blue-silver. \u201cIt\u2019s like stone washed jeans now,\u201d he said. Once Chandler and Anjelica pay off the remaining $18,000 on her loans, they\u2019ll buy another car, he added.\n\nThe couple and their two-month old daughter are now living with Anjelica\u2019s mother, saving money on rent and child care. The couple still runs \u201ca pretty tight ship\u201d when it comes the budget, though expenses have increased with the addition of their daughter. He\u2019s now budgeted $250 for groceries and $250 for weekend and date nights on a biweekly basis. They usually don\u2019t spend all that money though.\n\n\u201cIt would be easy now to dial it back,\u201d Chandler said. But with his big time philanthropic goals, he won\u2019t do it.\n\nChandler still listens to \u201cDreams\u201d once and a while and remembers where he was in 2011: \u201cIt also makes me look at my life at this moment to make sure I\u2019m still pushing my life forward.\u201d", "description": "He now only splurges on things that \u2018make me happy on the inside.\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP868_HappyM_ZG_20190821121248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
