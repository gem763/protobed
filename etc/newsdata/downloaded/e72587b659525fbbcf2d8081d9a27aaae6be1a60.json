She says the death toll could be \"unimaginable.\"\n\nWriting On It Won't Make It Real\n\nThe disaster is all the more reason for the president to take things just as seriously.\n\nBut he seems to have been busy with \"Sharpiegate,\" which arose after a weather map appeared from the White House that seemed to show Alabama in the path of Dorian, though it's been quite a while since the hurricane was forecast to head that way.\n\nAnd we know now that Dorian scraped the eastern coast of Florida, eventually making landfall on Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.\n\nThe map from the White House looked like someone had drawn a semicircle around Alabama in black marker, in an effort to include it in the storm path.\n\nWhat's Really More Dangerous?", "description": "What a mess.", "authors": ["Emily Reily"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_PzWJn4a2prV7nt4afIQgw--~B/aD0xNzg1O3c9MjY3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/8425c660af4533e1a32836c4686862d8", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
