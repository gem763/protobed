Here\u2019s a secret: it probably does.\n\nIf your gym has a studio where they hold group classes, chances are they don\u2019t mind if you wander in there when classes aren\u2019t in session. In fact, there is probably someone in there doing cool-down yoga right now.\n\nTo be sure that it\u2019s ok, ask at the gym\u2019s front desk. But every gym I\u2019ve ever been to allows people to use the studios when they\u2019re empty. Verify, but in general these are the unwritten rules:\n\nCheck the class schedule to make sure there isn\u2019t a class about to start.\n\nIf you use any gear in the room (like an exercise ball or a yoga mat), make sure to put it back, wiping it down if necessary.\n\nIf somebody else is already in the room, respect that they were there first. Don\u2019t get in their way, and if you want to turn the lights on or anything like that, be a decent human being and ask if they mind.\n\nTo that last point, yep, you should definitely ask before you turn on the lights. Or if you truly need to turn them on to see for safety reasons \u2014 you should at least say something, like \u201cHey, I need to turn the lights on, so sorry to bother you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible you didn\u2019t see anyone in the room at first (especially if they're working out in a dark corner) so this interaction may go smoother if you can make sure to be in a place they\u2019ll see when you walk in. And they have every right to say \u201cHey, mind if we keep the lights off?\u201d But in the end, it\u2019s a space that\u2019s open to both of you and you were lucky to find it empty, so enjoy the solitude while you have it.", "description": "Ever wish your gym had a nice, quiet space where you could do some stretching or bodyweight exercises without having to wedge yourself in between the machines and the dumbbell bros?
