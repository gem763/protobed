Executives spent time explaining their strategy for the ailing Victoria\u2019s Secret label, which has seen sales stall and backlash ensue as tastes veer away from the over-the-top sexy, male-gaze perspective that has been central to the brand for much of its existence.\n\n\u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret, particularly its Pink division, is repositioning its brand to be more about \u2018femininity as empowerment\u2019 and individuality,\u201d wrote UBS analysts led by Jay Sole in a post-event note. \u201cWe were surprised almost none of the imagery in the presentations featured well-known supermodels and much of it included non-airbrushed photos of \u2018regular-sized\u2019 women.\u201d\n\nRead: L Brands CEO Les Wexner \u2018embarrassed\u2019 by former ties with Jeffrey Epstein\n\nThe decision about whether or not to continue with the televised fashion show is still up in the air.\n\nJohn Mehas, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s chief executive of lingerie, detailed a strategy that will focus on \u201cemotional connections\u201d and \u201cproduct that she wants\u201d with a \u201crefreshed in-store experience\u201d and an \u201cupdated brand strategy,\u201d according to a FactSet transcript of the event.\n\n(Victoria\u2019s Secret also has a chief executive of the Pink brand, Amy Hauk, and the beauty division, Greg Unis.)\n\n\u201cThere was a lack of innovation on core franchise [items] and she refused to pay full price for it,\u201d Mehas said, referring to the brand\u2019s customers. \u201cOur position skewed heavily promotional and significantly broad-based brand eroding activities, which impacted other categories on top of bras.\u201d\n\nExecutives said the brand has been promotional for more than three years, and they discussed the headwinds that come with that.\n\n\u201cYou will start to see us lead with emotion, not promotion,\u201d Mehas said.\n\nThat could be difficult, which is why UBS maintained its neutral stock rating and cut its price target to $19 from $24.\n\n\u201c[W]e think Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s performance could get worse before it gets better and weigh on the stock price,\u201d UBS said, noting that executives said they would take time to shift the marketing message to keep from causing customer confusion.\n\nSee: Famous Footwear parent Caleres is \u2018well positioned\u2019 for tariffs through many goods are made in China\n\n\u201cOther retail turnarounds have shown this process can have a disproportionately negative effect on same-store sales growth and we think the same could be true for Victoria\u2019s Secret,\u201d UBS said.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets also maintained its sector weight rating after the event.\n\n\u201cA focus on innovation, reduction in promos, and importantly, acknowledgment that societal changes are redefining sexy are all key in a turnaround,\u201d wrote analysts led by Edward Yruma. \u201cTurning Victoria\u2019s Secret will take time, but we see reasons to be optimistic. More importantly, we are starting to see concrete signs that marketing and brand imagery are embracing inclusivity.\u201d\n\nDow Jones Market Data Group\n\nMKM Partners\u2019 Roxanne Meyer has less clarity about what will happen at Victoria\u2019s Secret. Meyer notes that L Brands\u2019 investor event usually coincides with the company\u2019s launch for the holiday season, which was not a focus of this event.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s early days for the Victoria\u2019s Secret turnaround. While some of the early signs are that the brand is moving in a more \u201cglamorous, emotional, and highly differentiated\u201d direction, there are questions about whether shoppers will respond positively.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Double jeopardy for retailers: the online menace and the recession\n\n\u201cWe note the more fashion-forward and sexy pieces from prior leadership didn\u2019t work well, and the company walked away from sexy pieces from prior leadership didn\u2019t work well, and the company walked away from sexy sleep a few years ago given a lack of customer interest,\u201d Meyer wrote. \u201cEven if the product/vision does take hold, it could take several quarters to wean customers off of the intense promotional activity they expect.\u201d\n\nMKM rates L Brands shares neutral and lowered its price target to $21 from $26.\n\nL Brands stock has tumbled 33.6% over the past year while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.72% is up 3.9% for the period.", "description": "L Brands hosted its investor day, with a focus on the effort to revitalize the Victoria\u2019s Secret brand.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GY374_victor_ZG_20181112112547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
