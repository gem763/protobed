Mnuchin and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, along with regulator Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, testified before the Senate Banking Committee on the plan for returning Fannie and Freddie to private ownership. The companies have become profitable again and have fully repaid their bailouts.\n\nUnder the plan, their profits would no longer go to the Treasury but would be used to build up their capital bases as a cushion against possible future losses.\n\nFannie and Freddie together guarantee roughly half of the $10 trillion U.S. home loan market. They don\u2019t make home loans. They buy them from banks and other lenders, and bundle them into securities, guarantee them against default and sell them to Wall Street investors.\n\nCalabria said Fannie and Freddie\u2019s capital must be bulked up \u201cto match their risk profiles\u201d and avoid another bailout. \u201cIn their current financial condition, the (companies) are not equipped to withstand a downturn in the housing market,\u201d he testified, adding, \u201cIt keeps me up at night.\u201d\n\nThe administration promises in the plan to preserve homebuyers\u2019 access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which are the pillar of housing finance.\n\nThe plan \u201cwould preserve the longstanding government support of the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage loan,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThat support, however, should be explicitly defined, tailored and paid for.\u201d\n\nMnuchin acknowledged that for prices of 30-year mortgages to remain close to current market levels, some level of government support would be needed. He said Congress should authorize an explicit, paid-for guarantee \u201cbacked by the full faith and credit of the federal government\u201d for qualified mortgages. The guarantee also should be available to competitors of Fannie and Freddie as mortgage financers, he said.\n\nThe administration initially looked to Congress for legislation to overhaul the housing finance system and return the companies to private shareholders. But Congress hasn\u2019t acted, and now officials say they will take administrative action for the core change, ending the Fannie and Freddie conservatorships. They haven\u2019t given a timeline for the administrative action.\n\n\u201cThe Trump plan will make mortgages more expensive and harder to get,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee\u2019s senior Democrat.\n\nA flashpoint came over the issue of affordable housing. Fannie and Freddie currently have mandated targets for helping low-income and minority borrowers to buy homes.\n\nA change outlined in the plan, which would have to be approved by Congress, would replace Fannie and Freddie\u2019s affordable housing goals with more \u201ctailored support\u201d for first-time homebuyers and low- and moderate-income borrowers. \u201cWe want to do it in the most effective way,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nThose proposals are \u201cabout leveling the playing field for Wall Street,\u201d Brown said.\n\nUnder Carson, HUD proposed last month to make it harder for people to prove unintentional discrimination, known as \u201cdisparate impact,\u201d against mortgage lenders and landlords. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told Carson that the proposal \u201cgoes way beyond\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 ruling affirming that disparate impact can be considered discriminatory even without explicit intent \u2014 but also putting limits on its application in practice.\n\nVan Hollen asked Carson about his newspaper commentary in 2015 that \u201cgovernment-engineered attempts to legislate racial equality create consequences that often make matters worse.\u201d\n\nCarson responded that \u201cWe uphold the principles of disparate impact.\u201d\n\nSen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the panel\u2019s chairman, has previously proposed legislation to overhaul the housing finance system. He said at the hearing that the administration\u2019s plan is close to his proposal, but \u201cmy strong preference remains to fix it through comprehensive legislation.\u201d\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., implored the officials to put a proposal before Congress. \u201cThis whole thing is a car wreck; it\u2019s a dumpster fire,\u201d Kennedy said. Put it before the committee, \u201cand let senators be senators.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Trump administration officials on Tuesday defended their plan to Congress for ending government control of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, clashing with Democratic senators on whether the change would raise home borrowing costs and neglect lower-income homeowners.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Marcy Gordon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/mortgage_giants_trump_plan_75710_c0-0-5472-3190_s1770x1032.jpg?84283544d3cc688d49296344fdb2455c1a0f271f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
