A dupe is a product that in some ways works as well as \u2014 or better than \u2014 a fancier, more famous thing, and we're sharing our favorites. Welcome to Dupes Week. Photo: Robin Reetz\n\nThere\u2019s something about fashionably ugly clothing that\u2019s always appealed to me, whether it\u2019s dad shoes, cargo pants, or bike shorts. Maybe that\u2019s in part a pretentious instinct, the appeal of knowing that not everyone will get it. All the better if the item in question has not yet become a full-blown trend.\n\nAs is the case with this $760 \u201ctechnical canvas tool vest\u201d I saw on Need Supply Co. The luxury brand Ganni seemed to be doing something similar, albeit in shearling, and the look had also trickled down to Stussy. And so I began I began to investigate \u201ctool vests,\u201d or what you also might call \u201cdad fishing vests.\u201d Straddling the worlds of masculine and feminine and featuring an oversize fit and undeniable practicality, something about these vests just felt right in the way about-to-be-trends always do. Plus, considering the underrepresentation of pockets in women\u2019s clothing, how could I say no to a garment so well suited for on-the-go storage of my MetroCard, debit card, stray mints, phone, and all those other pieces of garbage I carry around?\n\nI found the perfect match in the Kedera Fishing Vest \u2014 on Amazon, as it happened. It seemed to have a slightly oversize fit, mesh panels, a Yeezy-esque neutral tone, and more pockets than I\u2019d know what to do with. At $20, I felt like I could afford to give it a shot.\n\nAnd I was right. Aside from looking cool, it is super lightweight, and very easy to wear. Vest\u2019s first trip out was to a seafood restaurant in Montauk, where I wore it over a silk slip dress, with wedge heels. In the city, I can wear it with pretty much anything \u2014 with jeans and a tee for work, or linen shorts and Converse on the weekend.\n\nUnlike the Ganni or Heron Preston versions, it doesn\u2019t have the same level of design detail \u2014 no contrast stitching or fancy labels, and the weight of the fabric isn\u2019t as substantial (it doesn\u2019t have that luxury feel). But my Amazon iteration still makes a statement. Posting about it on Instagram Stories has garnered me multiple DMs \u2014 some of approval, others of confusion.
