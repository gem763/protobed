MGM owns the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor at attendees of a music festival before turning the gun on himself.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRobert Eglet, one of the attorneys for the victims, said Thursday that the agreement would settle \u201csubstantially all\u201d lawsuits and complaints against the company alleging negligence for allowing Paddock to stockpile numerous weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his room.\n\nThe company had initially argued that the shooting constituted an \u201cact of terrorism\u201d and that, under a federal law passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, it was shielded from liability. It also cited its hiring of a security firm for the concert that had a special designation from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAs part of an attempt to move the cases to federal court and argue the law exempted them, the company countersued or sued more than 1,000 litigants without seeking financial damages, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cWhile nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,\u201d Eglet said in a statement, according to the Times, commending MGM\u2019s \u201cgood corporate citizenship.\u201d\n\nThe Hill has reached out to MGM Resorts for comment.", "description": "MGM resorts will pay up to $800 million to family members of victims of the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting by an individual in modern U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lasvegas_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
