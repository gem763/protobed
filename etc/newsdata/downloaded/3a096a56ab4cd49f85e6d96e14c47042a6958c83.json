So let\u2019s work together to make France better.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that in a co-working space, we each have our skills. And we meet the needs of the customer by associating different companies. And that allows us to build an offer that we could not do if we were alone.\n\n\u201cSo yes, maybe politics could be inspired by co-working spaces.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Christian Bach, a journalist with the Derni\u00e8res Nouvelles d\u2019Alsace daily newspaper, St\u00e9phane said he is following the elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cOf course I am interested in the campaign, if only for one thing: when you are an entrepreneur, the environment of your company is very important.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have people appointed to power, who will enact new laws and this will have an impact on the company. So you are very much interested in following what happens.\u201d\n\nSt\u00e9phane described his frustration at the current tax system following the last presidential election, saying: \u201cYou know, I am among the disillusioned from 2012.\n\n\u201cAt the time, there was the economist, Thomas Piketty, who had a lot of wind behind him. And I said to myself, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll finally have a real tax reform that we need.\u2019\n\n\u201cIndeed, if you look at France, there is an absolutely incredible thing when you are an entrepreneur, you realize that taxation is further reduced when there is no risk on investment.\n\n\u201cIf you want to invest where there are no risks, taxation is low.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, starting a business, investing in a business, is something risky, and well, taxation is higher.\n\n\u201cThis is even higher than if you were making a risk-free investment such as life insurance. So after a while, you say to yourself you\u2019re going against the current. You should be paid for the risk.\n\n\u201cBusiness creation should be supported because it means creating jobs.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nProducer: Olivier P\u00e9guy, euronews\n\nin association with Christian Bach, Derni\u00e8res Nouvelles d\u2019Alsace\n\nEditor: Emma Belay\n\nEuronews powered by Google News Lab.", "description": "Tech entrepreneur St\u00e9phane Becker says French politicians could learn from his sector's working environment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/362256/1000x563_362256.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-04"}
