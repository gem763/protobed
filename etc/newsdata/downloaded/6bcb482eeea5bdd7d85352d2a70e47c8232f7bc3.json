We have made great progress.'\n\nDr Koch replied: 'It has been a wonderful day ... we look forward to the rest of the series.'\n\nKoch and Morgan will venture back out Friday for more battery work 250 miles (400 km) up.\n\nNASA astronaut Christina Koch (right) conducts a spacewalk at the Port-6 (P6) truss structure work site to upgrade International Space Station power Replacing the Space Station's Solar Array Batteries\n\nNASA astronaut Andrew Morgan waves from inside the crew lock portion of the Quest airlock where spacewalks in U.S. spacesuits are staged\n\nThe 428lb (180kg) batteries - half the size of a refrigerator - are part of the space station's solar power network.\n\nAstronauts have been upgrading them since 2017 and are now more than halfway done.\n\nThe old ones are 10 years old; the new ones are expected to last until the end of the space station's life, providing vital power on the night side of the Earth.\n\nEight large solar 'wings' power the space station, with four on either side of the structure.\n\nThe photovoltaic cells provide electricity to the station during the hours of sunlight and send energy to a bank to be stored for use when the station is in the shadow of Earth.\n\nExpedition 61 Commander Luca Parmitano of ESA (European Space Agency) assists NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan (left) and Christina Koch (right) in their U.S. spacesuits\n\nThe Kounotori H-II Transfer Vehicle 8 (HTV-8) from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, used to deliver the batteries on September 28, is pictured attached to the International Space Station's Harmony module (out of frame)\n\nThese latest battery swaps are especially difficult given the extreme location on the station's sprawling frame. It's too far for the 58-foot (17m) robot arm to reach, forcing astronauts to move the batteries back and forth themselves.\n\nThat's why so many spacewalks are needed this time to replace 12 old nickel-hydrogen batteries with six new lithium-ion versions.\n\nJapan's H-II Transfer Vehicle-8 (HTV-8) was used to deliver the batteries on September 28, attaching to the International Space Station's Harmony module.\n\nKoch and Morgan took turns holding each battery as they made their way, inchworm style, along the structure. The batteries were so bulky that it blocked the spacewalkers' views of one another, prompting constant updates.\n\nThe astronauts took to Twitter from space to post photos of their first space walk. Christina Koch wrote: 'A joy and privilege working with Andrew Morgan outside.'\n\nAndrew Morgan also shared a picture of Dr Koch writing: 'I took this photo of my awesome crew mate.'\n\nDr Koch said at one point: 'I am right next to you.'\n\nDr Morgan replied: 'I have the battery'.\n\nThey ended up plugging in two new batteries, one more than anticipated, and removing an extra old one.\n\nThe seven-hour spacewalk ended on another high note, at least for Koch. As she headed back inside, Mission Control gave her a National Football League update: 'Good news, Eagles are ahead 14-0 in the second quarter.' She replied, 'Go birds!' The Philadelphia Eagles routed the New York Jets, 31-6.\n\nNASA astronaut Christina Koch (top center) works to upgrade International Space Station power systems\n\nNASA plans to wrap up the five battery spacewalks this month, followed by a Russian spacewalk. Then five more U.S.-Italian spacewalks will be conducted in November and December to fix a key science instrument. NASA is calling it a 'spacewalk bonanza.'\n\nThis unusual crush of spacewalks will feature the first all-female spacewalk - by Koch and Jessica Meir - later this month.\n\nKoch is two-thirds of the way through a more than 300-day mission. It will be the longest single spaceflight by a woman.\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Andrew Morgan work outside the International Space Station, Sunday, on the first of five spacewalks to replace old batteries", "description": "Christina Koch, 40, and Andrew Morgan, 43, (pictured) removed three batteries and installed two new ones, lugging the 180kg batteries along the ship themselves before pausing to enjoy the view.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483534-0-image-a-45_1570613536314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
