Our mutual enemy is outside the Middle East.\"\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly clashed at meetings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over oil output policies. Tensions between the two countries flared after Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for an attack on Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14., a charge Tehran denies.\n\n\"We have no dispute with Saudi Arabia ... I have no problem to meet with Saudi Arabia's oil minister,\" Zanganeh said.\n\nSeparately, Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation (AEOI) reiterated on Sunday that the country would reduce its commitments under the deal further if the European parties to the pact did not meet promises to shield Iran's economy from U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"We will go ahead with our plans to decrease our commitments to the nuclear deal if other parties fail to keep their promises,\" the Students News Agency ISNA quoted AEOI's spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying.
