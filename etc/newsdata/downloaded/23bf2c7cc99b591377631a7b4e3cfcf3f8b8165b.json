International results can be seen on the left, with Colombia dominated by cocaine\n\nHighest levels of Cocaine's biomarker Benzoylecgonine, were found in London , Bristol, Amsterdam, Zurich, Geneva, St Gallen, and Antwerp\n\nCocaine was most popular in Europe, with some of the highest levels found in sewage in London\n\nAmphetamines, such as the street drug speed, were found to be getting increasingly popular in Barcelona, Geneva, Berne, Zurich, Dortmund and Berlin.\n\nHowever methamphetamine was not found to be popular in Europe in comparison to the U.S. and Australia.\n\nMDMA was found to be most popular in the Dutch cities of Eindhoven, Utrecht and Amsterdam but also topped lists in Helsinki, Oslo, Brussels, Dortmund, Zagreb, Zurich, Geneva and Barcelona.\n\nTel Aviv, Israel, was the only non-European city to show similar levels of MDMA usage as cities in Europe.\n\nThe team begun sampling wastewater of European cities in 2011 before taking the study worldwide in 2014.\n\nProfessor Iria Gonz\u00e1lez-Mari\u00f1o who co-led the study at the University of Salamanca in Spain told Vice: 'This is the largest wastewater\u2010based epidemiology study ever performed in terms of cities (120) and countries (37) involved and of the monitoring duration (2011\u201317).\n\n'The extensive data set obtained for cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA showed a comprehensive picture of spatial and temporal trends of use.'\n\nHundred of billions are estimated to be spent globally in the illegal drugs trade however the scale of the use has been difficult for authorities to determine until now.\n\nHistorically, the global spread of drug usage has been established through a combination of seizures by authorities, public surveys, drug\u2010related hospital admissions and treatments and arrest data.\n\nA more accurate assessment can be made with the quantitative data collected.\n\nMDMA was found to be most popular in the Dutch cities of Eindhoven, Utrecht and Amsterdam but also topped lists in Helsinki, Oslo, Brussels, Dortmund, Zagreb, Zurich, Geneva and Barcelona\n\nMethamphetamine was most prevalent in North America and Australasia\n\nAmphetamines such as the street drug speed were found to be getting increasingly popular in Barcelona, Geneva, Berne, Zurich, Dortmund and Berlin\n\nData surrounding public holidays was removed from analysis to avoid a spike in results from above average usage skewing data.\n\nCannabis use was not included in the study due to difficulty detecting the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) molecule which bonds with water particles.\n\nThey also took into account prescription drugs which presented the same chemical footprint as illicit drugs when combined.\n\nThe study was published on Wednesday in the journal Addiction.", "description": "Testing the wastage of 60 million people for cocaine, amphetamines and MDMA researchers at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, were able to determine which cities and nations used drugs most.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20182194-0-image-a-15_1572012303559.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
