The Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO), which has seen multiple delays since it was first suggested in 2016, would be the world's largest.\n\n\"We are ready whenever the shareholders decide it is the time to list,\" Nasser told CNBC's Steve Sedgewick during the event.\n\nAramco is expected to file its IPO prospectus by the end of this month, according to reports.\n\nThe kingdom reportedly plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange, the Tadawul, before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020 as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated the firm's value at $2 trillion, while analysts put the figure closer to $1.5 trillion.\n\nThe success of the IPO depends in part on the oil price, which is down some 30% in the last year, despite heightened geopolitical tensions in the Gulf region.\n\nBrent crude futures were trading at $58.78 a barrel on Wednesday morning at 11:15 a.m. London time, up nearly 1% from the previous day. Still, the international oil benchmark's price is now lower than it was the day before the Aramco attacks, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.\n\nThere are \"many factors\" impacting the oil price today, Nasser told CNBC's Sedgwick, noting that the global economic situation as a whole was affecting crude prices. \"I think market was very satisfied with Saudi Aramco's response (to the attacks), but also... there is a tariffs dispute ongoing between two super global economies. All of these things are impacting price of crude.\" The CEO added that there is ample oil supply on the market, and that he expects demand to average at 1 million bpd.\n\nIn earlier comments Wednesday, Nasser said that there was \"no doubt\" Iran was behind attacks on Saudi Arabia, which struck multiple points at two of Aramco's largest facilities: Abqaiq, the largest crude oil processing and stabilization plant in the world, and Khurais, the kingdom's second-largest oil field.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels, who have been at war with the Saudis since 2015 and are backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the strike, but numerous Western governments and security experts say the rebels could not have carried out such a sophisticated attack.\n\nIn late September, ratings agency Fitch downgraded Saudi Arabia's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating from A+ to A, citing the \"vulnerability of its economic infrastructure\" and \"deterioration in Saudi Arabia's fiscal and external balance sheets.\" Riyadh was quick to reject the downgrade, calling it \"somewhat speculative.\"\n\nThe Aramco IPO is part of the kingdom's Vision 2030, an initiative spearheaded by the 34-year-old crown prince to diversify the country's economy and reduce its reliance on hydrocarbon revenues.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's full oil production capacity will be recovered by the end of November, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said at the Oil and Money Conference in London on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106132119-1568651228106gettyimages-1167201891.jpeg?v=1568651263", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
