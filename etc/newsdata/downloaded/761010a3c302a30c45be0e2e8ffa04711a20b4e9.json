You cannot function effectively,\u201d says Yousef al-Horr, founder of the Gulf Organization for Research and Development.\n\nYet outdoor air conditioning is part of a vicious cycle. Carbon emissions create global warming, which creates the desire for air conditioning, which creates the need for burning fuels that emit more carbon dioxide. In Qatar, total cooling capacity is expected to nearly double from 2016 to 2030, according to the International District Cooling & Heating Conference.\n\nAnd it\u2019s going to get hotter.\n\nBy the time average global warming hits 2 degrees Celsius, Qatar\u2019s temperatures would soar, said Mohammed Ayoub, senior research director at the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute. In rapidly growing urban areas throughout the Middle East, some predict cities could become uninhabitable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about 4 to 6 degrees Celsius increase in an area that already experiences high temperatures,\u201d Ayoub said. \u201cSo, what we\u2019re looking at more is a question of how does this impact the health and productivity of the population.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Graphics World Climate-Environment Climate-Change-Qatar-Air-Conditioning-Outdoors"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
