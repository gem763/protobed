The ways the interior is utilised \u2013 things such as the division of rooms and the amount of dedicated open space \u00ad\u2013 set up opportunities for and limitations on how we\u2019ll interact with those around us (for better and worse).\n\nIt may not just be the literal footprint of a space that creates our relationships, though. A small 2019 research report from Brigham Young University, in the US state of Utah, shows that the more positive we feel about our homes, the healthier our interactions in the home can be.\n\nCarly Thornock, an interior designer, led a research team following 164 families with young children in the western US who came from a wide spectrum of home types and income levels \u2013 some with fewer than 100 sq ft of space per person.\n\nOver two years, they observed how their physical environments related to four basic elements of family functioning: affective responsiveness, emotional expression, acceptance and decision making. The children and parents also took surveys about their family functioning at home, and were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements like \u201cI feel crowded in my house\u201d or \u201cfamily members feel accepted for what they are\u201d. Researchers then contextualised these answers with variables including the families\u2019 house sizes, income, number of rooms and family members in the home.\n\nThe researchers found overall that increases in physical space per person did correspond to happier families. But what truly surprised them was how families perceived that physical space \u2013 the amount of space per person, and whether it felt too crowded or distant \u2013 had a much greater impact on their relationships.", "description": "Perhaps you think that more space in your family home is always better \u2013 but how you feel about the space may make more difference than anything else.", "authors": ["Peter Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7l/r5/p07lr5dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
