According to excerpts of the book obtained by Variety, the ex-NBC staffer Brooke Nevils claimed Lauer had raped her in a Sochi hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n\u201cI feel like we owe it to our viewers to pause for a moment,\u201d said Guthrie. \u201cThis is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it. I want to say that I know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then. It\u2019s not easy now. And we support her and any women who come forward with claims. It\u2019s just very painful for all of us at NBC and at the Today show, and it\u2019s very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nKotb said she was having a flashback to two years ago when the women sat together on air to tell viewers about Lauer\u2019s firing.\n\nThe women had prayed upstairs before today\u2019s show, Kotb said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you feel like you\u2019ve known someone for 12 years ... and all of a sudden a door opens up and it\u2019s a part of them you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe allegations were not of an affair, emphasized Kotb, but \u201cof a crime. That\u2019s shocking to all of us who have sat with Matt for many, many years.\u201d\n\nKotb said that they would \u201ccontinue to process this part of this horrific story ... Our thoughts are with Brooke. It\u2019s not easy, what she did, to come forward, it\u2019s not easy at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I speak for all of us: we are disturbed to our core,\u201d added Guthrie.\n\nGuthrie ended the segment by saying that they would \u201ccontinue to keep viewers informed\u201d as the story developed.\n\nLauer is yet to respond to the fresh allegations, though in 2018 told the Washington Post that \u201cany allegations of coercive, aggressive, or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false.\u201d", "description": "Horrific allegations detailed in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book emerged overnight after a former NBC staffer came forward to accuse Matt Lauer of anal rape.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_791,w_1407,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570623848/Screen_Shot_2019-10-09_at_8.09.28_AM_bbn9il", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
