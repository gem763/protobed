Quants Cut Stock Exposures to Lowest Since 2014 as S&P Crawled to Record\n\n(Bloomberg) -- As the S&P 500 crawled its way to a new record, some of the smartest investors were creeping to the exit.\n\nComing into this week, market-neutral quants had cut their gross stock allocations to the lowest in nearly five years, according to data compiled by Credit Suisse (SIX: ) Group AG\u2019s prime brokerage.\n\nConflicting signals on risk appetite and economic growth are whiplashing funds that dissect equities based on traits like value and momentum. All that is stoking factor volatility and increasing the temptation to delever as the anxiety-ridden rally of 2019 rolls on.\n\nThe market-neutral cohort, which take no directional bets on the benchmark, eked out a return of 1% in the nine months through September, compared with 6% for hedge funds overall. They recorded some $3.9 billion of outflows in the period, taking total assets to $66 billion, Eurekahedge data show.\n\n\u201cIt looks nice -- the market\u2019s up 20%, but it\u2019s been a wild ride underneath the covers,\u201d said Mark Connors, global head of risk advisory at Credit Suisse (SIX: ) in New York. \u201cThe factor path has been unpredictable.\u201d\n\nCase in point: Last week saw the value strategy revive once more as hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal buoyed economic prospects, just weeks after a rotation in the opposite direction driven in part by recession fears.\n\nTo some, it\u2019s a sign of late-cycle fragility as investors turn on every economic and political headline on a dime. But there\u2019s also a whiff of suspicion that choppy rotations have been exacerbated by deleveraging among systematic funds.\n\n\u201cQuants sometimes can be a canary in the coal mine,\u201d said Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo GmbH, which provides tools for portfolio construction and risk analytics. \u201cMaybe we are going to see going forward more volatility in style factors as funds need to deleverage or people pull their money.\u201d\n\nSome factors are becoming more sensitive to shifts in positioning. The strength of the recent rally in cheap cyclical shares, for instance, caught many by surprise given the lack of a fundamental catalyst, Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ). strategists led by Derek Harris wrote in a note.\n\nAt Los Angeles Capital Management, while cheap relative valuations are starting to push portfolios toward value shares, its models still favor more expensive growth stocks because the fund expects global economic growth to remain weak.\n\n\u201cWe are in a choppier environment,\u201d said chief investment officer Hal Reynolds at the firm overseeing $25 billion including absolute-return strategies. \u201cCompression in returns and pick-up in risk have both occurred this year, leading to the reduction in risk budgets.\u201d\n\nRelative to their market-neutral quant peers, other hedge funds appear to have turned more bullish. Macro funds and commodity trading advisors, which mostly trade index futures rather than individual stocks, have expanded their long bets this month, Credit Suisse (SIX: ) data show.\n\nMeanwhile, long-short stock pickers have boosted net exposure to the highest since March as they covered short positions amid the surprise resurgence this month of trades betting on higher inflation and growth. Financial stocks have outperformed, while defensive sectors from consumer staples to utilities have lost money -- a reversal of market trends seen earlier this year.\n\nStill, the very fact that these funds haven\u2019t added longs aggressively underscores the persistent caution stalking the 2019 rally.\n\n\u201cThe short didn\u2019t work, so you reduce it -- but don\u2019t commit your capital to going long something that may be just a short-lived rotation,\u201d said Credit Suisse\u2019s Connors. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a reflation trade there.\u201d", "description": "Quants Cut Stock Exposures to Lowest Since 2014 as S&P Crawled to Record", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7G0MD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
