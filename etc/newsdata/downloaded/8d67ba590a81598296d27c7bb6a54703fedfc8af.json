I've always wanted to win a Cup race here. I've been close a number of times, so to get a golden monster (trophy) is going to be really sweet.\n\n\"I\u2019ve kept saying that I felt really close to winning here or anywhere right now. Our pit crew has been doing a better job, our team has been doing a better job. I\u2019ve been doing a better job.\u201d\n\nThe farthest @KyleLarsonRacin has made it in the #NASCARPlayoffs!\n\n\n\nHe's through to the Round of 8 with a win at the @MonsterMile! @CGRTeamspic.twitter.com/yJ7scdcxph \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) October 6, 2019\n\nLarson has six career Cup victories and his first one in the playoffs. He led 154 laps, nearly all coming in the final stage, after Denny Hamlin went from dominant to dud midway through the race. Hamlin led 219 laps before fading.\n\nMartin Truex Jr. won the spring race at Dover and didn\u2019t have enough down the stretch to catch Larson and complete the season sweep.\n\n\u201cWe just ran out of time,\u201d Truex said.\n\nLarson did win the non-points NASCAR All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway this year and felt like he was inching closer toward a checkered flag on the strength of a sensational late-summer run of top-10 finishes.\n\nKyle Larson celebrates in victory lane after winning the Drydene 400 at Dover International Speedway.

He\u2019s the first driver in the field of eight.\n\n\u201cEverybody in this playoff field is going to be stressing next week at Talladega except for me, so that\u2019s good,\u201d Larson said. \u201cLast time I was at Talladega I was on my lid. I could still end up on my lid next week, but it\u2019s not going to matter after this win.\n\nPlayoff drivers took the top six spots: Truex was second, followed by Alex Bowman, Kevin Harvick, Hamlin and Kyle Busch. Matt DiBenedetto, Jimmie Johnson, Kurt Busch and Clint Bowyer rounded out the top 10.\n\nPLAYOFF PERIL: Joey Logano and Chase Elliott both had their races ruined before the race even finished 10 laps. Logano failed to start the race because of a broken axle on the No. 22 Ford. He eventually hit the track more than 20 laps down and finished 34th.\n\n\u201cWe just used our mulligan up,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a must-win but we must do really well in the next two races.\u201d\n\nElliott, who won last week at Charlotte, had the engine in his No. 9 Chevrolet blow up just laps into the race and he finished last.\n\nElliott won Dover last season and will likely have to win at Talladega or Kansas to advance into the next round.\n\n\"I just had an engine failure of some sort,\" Elliott said in the garage. \"It just quit running. It didn\u2019t really seem like anything was off. We were just kind of making laps and then obviously had a failure.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s an unfortunate way to start this round for sure.\u201d\n\n\"I just blew up.\"\n\n\n\nChase Elliott becomes the second #NASCARPlayoffs drivers with issues in the first 10 laps at the @MonsterMile!

Kyle Larson also passed Hamlin at the end of the stage to finish second, while Hamlin dropped to third. Kevin Harvick, Jimmie Johnson, Alex Bowman, Erik Jones, Blaney, Brad Keselowski and Clint Bowyer.\n\nSTAGE 1: Pole sitter Hamlin won the opening stage, dominating from the drop of the green flag and only losing the lead while the field made green flag pit stops. His Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Truex finished second, Larson third, Wiliam Byron fourth and Harvick fifth. Bowman, Johnson, Kyle Busch, Jones and Blaney rounded out the top 10.\n\nDrydene 400 results\n\nSunday at the 1-mile Dover International Speedway (starting position in parentheses):\n\n1.
