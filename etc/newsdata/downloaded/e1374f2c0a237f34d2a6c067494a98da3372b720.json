And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement. \u201c\u2026 As we learned the hard way during the Obama administration, American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s surprise announcement late Sunday evening came as a shock to the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have partnered with Washington for years in the battle against the Islamic State.\n\nKurdish fighters have accused Mr. Trump of a \u201cstab in the back\u201d for the decision that opens the door to a Turkish-led military operation against the group that Ankara views as a threat to its own security.\n\nThe Kurds have many friends in Congress, in part for their role in rolling back Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and many spoke out against Mr. Trump\u2019s move. They also warned the Islamic State could rebuild its forces if the Kurds cease to aid the U.S. coalition inside Syria.\n\n\u201cAs the Syrian people seek stability post-conflict, we ought not to give ISIS any room to regain territory,\u201d said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican. \u201cSyria\u2019s location leaves it vulnerable to adversaries, and an American presence preserves the possibility for peace,\u201d she continued.\n\nDemocrats took an even harder stance against the decision that many said could cause a resurgence of the Islamic State \u2014 whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly insisted had been defeated.\n\nSen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, said the withdrawal \u201cwill invite a fresh wave of terrorism, insurgency and chaos in the Middle East, providing conditions for ISIS to regenerate and allowing Iran and Russia to further entrench themselves in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee claimed Mr. Trump is \u201cconducting U.S. foreign policy through the singular domestic focus of reelection politics,\u201d and is \u201cagain doing Russia\u2019s bidding.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
