They\u2019ve come to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nPresident Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are among those in attendance, and they come with an agenda of their own. Item 1 for the Americans is to remind world leaders \u2014 in subtle and not-so-subtle ways \u2014 that Beijing is up to no good.\n\nChina is bad on many levels. And Trump will call attention to one facet of their badness that gets too little attention: the fact that the world\u2019s leading persecutors of the Islamic religion reside in Beijing.\n\nDANIEL TURNER: THE UN'S TRAVELING CLIMATE CHANGE SALVATION SHOW \u2014 NOTHING SAVES THE WORLD LIKE A MEETING\n\nWhile many of the world\u2019s dignitaries sat in the General Assembly to pontificate sanctimoniously about the climate, Trump chaired a roll-up-your-sleeves side session to explore ways to combat the global assault on religious liberty.\n\nIt was an opportunity to turn the spotlight on China\u2019s abuses of Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim, Turkic group found in about a dozen countries.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAbout 11 million Uyghurs live in the Xinjiang region of the People's Republic of China. Beijing has rounded up at least one million in \u201ccamps\u201d that exist completely outside the Chinese legal system. Meanwhile, the government systematically suppresses their religion and culture and, according to reports, has been steadily demolishing mosques.\n\nUnlike many other countries, when China places its nationals in the U.N. system, it expects them to further Beijing\u2019s interests, not the mission of the organizations they work for. Those who don\u2019t face serious consequences.\n\nThroughout this barbarous campaign, Beijing has lied to the world about what it\u2019s doing.\n\nRemarkably, most of the world has said little about the oppression. Even the Arab world has made hardly a peep.\n\nThankfully, the State Department refuses to be silent, drumming a steady beat on the Uyghur crisis. Just this past Sunday, Pompeo urged other countries not to repatriate Uyghurs to China out of concern they might be incarcerated upon arrival.\n\nTrump\u2019s meeting on religious freedom won\u2019t be the only side event in which the U.S. will have a chance to remind the world that China is part of the problem. The foreign ministers of Australia, Japan, India and the U.S. plan to meet as well. These nations have gotten together to form the \u201cquad\u201d \u2014 four countries who jointly advocate for a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d\n\nWhile the quad isn\u2019t aimed specifically at countering or containing China, there is no secret as to which country poses the greatest destabilizing threat in the region. Until now, the Quad had never met at the ministerial level. The meeting of ministers at the General Assembly is another signal, to China and the world, that the world is fed up with Beijing\u2019s shenanigans.\n\nThe U.S. will quietly distribute yet another message at the U.N. meeting: \u201cKeep an eye on what China is doing at \u2014 and to \u2014 the U.N.\u201d\n\nFor years, China has systematically tried to insert its citizens as employees and leaders at the U.N. and its associated organizations. And it\u2019s succeeding. Chinese nationals now lead four of the 15 U.N. specialized agencies. The last time a permanent Security Council member had its citizens leading four U.N. specialized agencies was 1956.\n\nNor has the placement of Chinese within the agencies been haphazard. Beijing is specifically targeting norm and \u201crule setting\u201d agencies such as the International Telecommunication Union.\n\nUnlike many other countries, when China places its nationals in the U.N. system, it expects them to further Beijing\u2019s interests, not the mission of the organizations for whom they work. Those who don\u2019t face serious consequences.\n\nBeijing does not shrink from putting a heavy thumb on its citizens. Exhibit A: Meng Hongwei, the former head of Interpol. He suddenly found himself thrown in jail, expelled from the Communist Party and facing prosecution in China for allegedly taking bribes. While the backstory behind Meng\u2019s fall from Beijing\u2019s grace remains unclear, the cloak-and-dagger way in which it happened serves as a clear reminder to Chinese citizens that they and their families are never out of the government\u2019s reach.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf China is allowed to run wild at the U.N., only Beijing will benefit. As Heritage scholar Brett Schaefer recently wrote, China is \"seeking to shift the values, programs and policies of the U.N. in ways that benefit Chinese priorities and ideology and that undermine the values and practices that have underpinned the international system for decades.\"\n\nThe U.S. is reminding its friends and allies they must keep on guard against China\u2019s nationalistic predations, even in a transnational setting like the U.N.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JAMES CARAFANO", "description": "If China is allowed to run wild at the U.N., only Beijing will benefit.", "authors": ["James Jay Carafano"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/17/694940094001_6087156671001_6087159209001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
