But for every bummer, there's a reclamation of sanity, identity or voice via cathartic scream.\n\nBelow you'll find an alphabetized list of NPR Music's top 20 songs of September 2019. Be sure to check out our top 10 albums from the month as well.\n\nStream The List On Spotify\n\nAngel Olsen, \"Lark\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nFueled by an orchestra and one of her strongest vocal performances to date, Angel Olsen pulls her emotions close to the chest then shoots them straight into the stratosphere. \u2014 Marissa Lorusso\n\nCarolina Eyck, \"Commemoration\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nA master of the instrument you can't touch, thereminist Carolina Eyck adds a chorus of vocal loops to her slithery tones, creating a surprisingly upbeat elegy. \u2014 Tom Huizenga\n\nCautious Clay, \"Erase\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nCautious Clay's snarky apathy towards social media rides out over clandestine bass. It almost makes the weariness sound sweet. \u2014 Sidney Madden\n\nCharli XCX, \"2099 (feat. Troye Sivan)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThis, the weirdest song on Charli XCX's new and partially eponymous album, is a disorienting, tongue-in-cheek lament of the life of an artist. And it's still really fun. \u2014 Andrew Flanagan\n\nChelsea Wolfe, \"Deranged for Rock & Roll\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThe rock singer and guitarist turns pensive and introspective with this creeping, sludgy requiem for sanity. \u2014 Robin Hilton\n\nDarrin Bradbury, \"This Too Shall Pass\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThe jokes in this shaggy-dog ode to optimism and its discontents are a wry painkiller for an era of accelerated aggravation. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\nDry Cleaning, \"Sit Down Meal\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThe moody, post-punk song takes a moment to wake up. But the singer \u2014 equally droll and disaffected in her delivery \u2014 works a slight-of-hand as the groove grows tentacles. \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nGirl Band, \"Salmon of Knowledge\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThe experimentalist inspirations driving Girl Band \u2014 towards the many lovely walls it crashes into \u2014 are made plain in this low-end-driven surrealist dialogue that, somehow, still manages to cohere. \u2014 Andrew Flanagan\n\nStream The List On Apple Music\n\nGreat Grandpa, \"Digger\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nFor Great Grandpa's Pat Goodwin, a Wildwood Tarot deck served as inspiration for \"Digger.\" Stirring and striking, it's an introspective exploration of circumstance and contrast, not a crystal ball of future visions. \u2014 Lyndsey McKenna\n\nHiss Golden Messenger, \"My Wing\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nPlay this beautiful slice of guitar-driven agnostic gospel on the hard days. It will help. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\nJon Pardi, \"Old Hat\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThe classic element that distinguishes this ode to the old ways is a twin-guitar part that evokes the glory days of the Eagles and the Allmans. Country's favorite new classicist makes it sound so fresh. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\nKalie Shorr, \"Alice in Wonderland\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nA word to a gaslit girl from one who's wisened up, this rocker is as gleefully mean as Avril Lavigne's finest and as sisterly as something by the Dixie Chicks. Hot stuff from one of Nashville's most promising. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\nLa Neve, \"A Pretty Red\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nIt's the end of the world as we know it, but La Neve's ESG-funkin', Deee-Lite-groovin' track wants some dang action. \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nLankum, \"The Wild Rover\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nLankum's transformation of this old Irish drinking song reveals a not-so-sober desperation, which the Dublin band grinds into a heavy drone of fiddle and harmonium. \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nLaurie Anderson & Tenzin Choegyal, \"Heart Sutra Song\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nInspired by the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and with vocals that soar like a proud eagle, this song invites you to step out of your body. \u2014 Tom Huizenga\n\nMicrowave, \"Leather Daddy\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nSometimes the bottle you stuff your feelings into reaches maximum capacity. The Atlanta band shifts from shrugging acoustic guitars to screaming brutality as frontman Nathan Hardy lets everything blow. \u2014 Robin Hilton\n\nMolly Sarl\u00e9, \"Almost Free\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nBased on a conversation Molly Sarl\u00e9 had with her father when he was contemplating suicide, \"Almost Free\" bares the fragility and wonder of life. Gut-wrenching and gorgeous. \u2014 Robin Hilton\n\nOvercoats, \"The Fool\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nBased on the tarot card, \"The Fool\" is about taking a leap of faith. Overcoats does just that, ratcheting up the duo's electronic-pop sound. \u2014 Bob Boilen\n\nSault, \"No Bulls***\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nFrom the mysterious British trio's second album of 2019, Sault follows up kiss-off track \"Don't Waste My Time\" with a hard-as-nails breakbeat, funky strings and a sweet voice kindly (and for the last time) telling you to piss off. \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nWaqWaq Kingdom, \"Doggy Bag\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThe Germany-based duo Shigeru Ishihara and Kiki Hitomi beam in this complex, and deceptively subtle, patchwork of bloops and samples compiled into a concise and utterly danceable mixed-media installation. \u2014 Andrew Flanagan", "description": "Angel Olsen shot her emotions into the stratosphere, Hiss Golden Messenger offered an agnostic gospel and Cautious Clay snarked on social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/26/ao-am-4_wide-10838f560bae946afe3f1c8b785ee8ff9b63d724.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
