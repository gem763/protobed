Few are likely ruling out the possibility that there could be more twists and turns in this matter of U.S.-China trade conflict,\" Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.\n\nThe U.S. did not, however, cancel plans for more tariffs in December and the sticking points of intellectual property and trade secrets still hang over the dispute. And the overall picture hasn't changed for companies, which are still holding off on forecasts and investments because of the uncertain trade situation.\n\nIn other trading, benchmark crude oil fell 59 cents to $53.00 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
