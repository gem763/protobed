Even that agreement is only in principle and not set out in writing.\n\nChina characterized what had been agreed to as progress rather than a deal.\n\n\"While the partial deal points to possible progress in more challenging elements of U.S.--China trade and commercial relations, we think the risks of a breakdown will rise once talks move on to highly contentious issues,\" said analysts at BNP Paribas.\n\nU.K. banks also cooled off after Friday's rally after European Union negotiators said they would \"intensify\" discussions on a mutually agreed pact for Britain to exit from the bloc. After surges of roughly 12% each on Friday, Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.LN) fell 3.5% and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.LN) fell 3.6%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 14, 2019 07:24 ET (11:24 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
