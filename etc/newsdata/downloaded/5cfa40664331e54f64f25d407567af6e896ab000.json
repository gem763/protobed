They each began running on Sept. 11, and they each refer to an official FBI website that contains details about the counterintelligence program in both English and Russian.\n\nOne of the ads shows a young woman in a graduation gown alongside Russian text that roughly translates to \u201cFor your future, for the future of your family.\u201d Another shows a chessboard in black-and-white beneath the Russian words for, \u201cIsn\u2019t it time for you to make your move?\u201d The third contains an image of a man walking with an umbrella alongside the Russian text for \u201cTime [to] build bridges.\n\nThe ads direct to an FBI page that says in English and Russian that the bureau\u2019s counterintelligence program is dedicated to protecting Americans \u201cthrough the detection, identification, and neutralization of hostile foreign intelligence activities,\u201d and it includes information about how to contact the D.C. field office from where it is run. They recently began being displayed to Facebook users logged on from around D.C., according to CNN.\n\n\u201cWe cannot comment except to note that Russia has a large number of intelligence officers based in Russian diplomatic facilities around the world. They are very active and pose a security risk to the US and our allies,\u201d Alan E. Kohler Jr., FBI special agent in charge of the D.C. field office\u2019s counterintelligence division, told CNN.\n\n\u201cThe FBI uses a variety of means to gather information, including the use of sources,\u201d he told CNN, the network reported. \u201cThe FBI will use all legal means available to locate individuals with information that can help protect the United States from threats to our national security.\u201d\n\nRussia notoriously used Facebook ads during the course of interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, federal officials previously concluded. The Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg-based \u201ctroll farm\u201d financed by an oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, bought ads on Facebook and other platforms to amplify disinformation and other content created as part of what the Department of Justice has called a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d attempt by Moscow to meddle in the race.\n\nMultiple social networks subsequently revised their advertising policies in response to Russian election meddling, including Facebook\u2019s decision in March to make all ads accessible through its public Ads Archive.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
