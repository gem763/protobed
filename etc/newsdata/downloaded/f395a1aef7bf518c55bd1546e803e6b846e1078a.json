The Turkish leader sees them as a terror threat and has sworn to defeat them.\n\nSDF troops were among the reported 50 to 100 soldiers engaging in joint patrols in northern Syria in compliance with a U.S.-Turkish agreement to maintain a safe zone within the country.\n\nTrump tweeted his about-face on U.S.-Syrian foreign policy after a Sunday phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured)\n\nErdogan convinced Trump to let his country deal with Kurdish forces in northern Syria\n\nTrump's decision has effectively nullified that agreement, so those troops will likely be redeployed somewhere else in the Mideast nation, current and former senior U.S. defense officials told NBC News.\n\nRobertson said he was 'absolutely appalled the U.S. would break ranks and abandon the Kurds to Turkey after those forces helped America defeat ISIS calling Erdogan a 'thug' while criticizing Trump for failing to retaliate against Saudi Arabia for the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe preacher also suggested leaving matters to Erdogan could endanger fellow Christians, an often endangered Mideast minority group, in the mostly Muslim region.\n\n'He has taken control of his country as a dictator,' Robertson said of the Turkish president. 'You say, he's an ally of America. It's nonsense. He is in it for himself. And the president who allowed Khashoggi to be cut in pieces without any repercussions whatsoever is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks.'\n\nRobertson joined a chorus of conservative and evangelical critics slamming Trump for his decision to withdraw U.S. military support to Kurdish rebels who have been fighting to overthrow Syria's president - Russian ally Bashar Al-Assad - since 2011.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the evangelical advocacy group Focus on the Family tweeted that 'an invasion by Turkey into [northeast] Syria would pose a grave threat to the region's Kurds and Christians.' Former Colorado Gov. Mike Huckabee said abandoning the Kurds would be a 'HUGE mistake' on Trump's part\n\nTony Perkins, president of the evangelical advocacy group Focus on the Family tweeted that 'an invasion by Turkey into [northeast] Syria would pose a grave threat to the region's Kurds and Christians.'\n\n'[It would endanger] the prospects of true religious freedom in the Middle East,' Perkins Tweeted Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom expressed 'deep concern' over Trump's announcement, tweeting that the move presents 'potentially grave implications for safety of religious and ethnic communities.'\n\nFormer Colorado Gov. Mike Huckabee said abandoning the Kurds would be a 'HUGE mistake' on Trump's part.\n\nEvangelicals like Robertson view supporting Israel as a Christian moral imperative consistent with End of Days prophecies in the book of Revelations\n\n'They've never asked us to do THEIR fighting-just give them tools to defend themselves,' Huckabee tweeted Monday morning. 'They have been faithful allies. We CANNOT abandon them.'\n\nHawkish neo conservatives view maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria as a necessary labor to limit Iranian power in the region and protect the state of Israel, the only Democratic nation in the Middle East.\n\nEvangelicals like Robertson view supporting Israel as a Christian moral imperative consistent with End of Days prophecies in the book of Revelations.\n\n'The continuation of Jewish sovereignty over the Holy Land is a further bulwark to us that the God of the Bible exists and that His Word is true,' Robertson told his followers in a 2004 speech. 'The God who spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai is our God. ... The Holy City of Jerusalem is our spiritual capital.'\n\nEnding American involvement in foreign wars was one of Trump's campaign promises, one he shared with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) at the time.\n\nBut Sanders and fellow Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren criticized Trump's pullout decision on Twitter Sunday.\n\n'I have long believed teh U.S. must responsibly end our military intervention in the Middle East. But Trump's abrupt announcement to withdraw from northern Syria and endorse Turkey's incursion is extremely irresponsible,' Sanders tweeted. 'It is likely to result in more suffering and instability.'", "description": "Robertson told his followers on Monday that Trump 'is in danger of losing the mandate of Heaven' if he follows through with his announced withdrawal of military support in Syria.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/05/19421784-0-image-a-22_1570508986893.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
