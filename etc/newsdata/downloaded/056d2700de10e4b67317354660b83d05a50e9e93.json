I don\u2019t know. He is so important as a run-scorer and the responsibility of captaincy take their toll on the mental capabilities as well. I would almost rather have him place 100% of his mental capacity on making runs.\n\n\u201cHe is always going to be there on the field for a captain to lean on and he is the sort of individual who will be reading the game the whole time. Even if you don\u2019t talk to him. You only have to watch him for five minutes and you know what he is thinking about.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Australian coach Justin Langer told the ABC \u201chonest conversations\u201d will be needed, but that Paine could continue to build into the role.\n\n\u201cTim Paine is doing a brilliant job at the moment as well. He\u2019s been outstanding in his time as captain, so however long he wants to keep playing for is another thing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe beautiful thing about Tim Paine is that he knows he can get better. He can keep getting better, he will keep learning, and with his youthful enthusiasm, even as a senior player, he\u2019s got lots of areas he can improve \u2014 that\u2019s heartening for him and that\u2019s heartening for us.\n\n\u201cBut for the moment, he\u2019s definitely doing a great job.\u201d", "description": "Australian Test captain Tim Paine has let his bat do the talking after claims his time in the national set up were numbered.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/80c0e150ed52a95b79d6f28a39439a37?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
