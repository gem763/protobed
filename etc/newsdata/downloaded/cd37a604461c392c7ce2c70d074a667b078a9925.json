Teigen called Trump a \u201cpussy ass bitch\u201d for not tagging her in his comment.\n\nSo The Donald is out of the running (and was never in it) in the Teigen-Legend household.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair posted Monday, the couple was asked who they do favor for 2020.\n\nLegend was reluctant at first, then spit it out.\n\n\u201cMy favorite \u2014 I\u2019m going to say it, we\u2019ll break news today \u2014 is Elizabeth Warren,\u201d he said of the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who has done her own verbal sparring with the president. \u201cShe\u2019s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\u201d\n\nTeigen?\n\n\u201cI love Elizabeth Warren,\u201d she said. \u201cI also love Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nAs for that Twitter fight with Trump, Legend told VF:\n\nWe know this president has a particular aversion to strong women coming after him, particularly women of color. So he had to call her out. Every time he does something like this, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don\u2019t know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a shitty human being every day.\n\nCheck out the full Vanity Fair cover story.", "description": "The celebrity couple talked about the 2020 election in an interview with Vanity Fair.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db6d84c210000df2c34b3d7.jpeg?cache=oerrflqrei&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
