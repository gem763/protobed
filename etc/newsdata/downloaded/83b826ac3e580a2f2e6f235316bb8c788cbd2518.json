That Trump sees the two groups as similar is crucial to understanding his hot-and-cold treatment of Fox.\n\nOn occasions when he\u2019s unhappy with the network\u2019s coverage, Trump will pick up the phone and call Scott to complain, a Trump-administration aide and a second Fox News employee told us. But the conversations, the Fox staffer said, don\u2019t tend to go well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure she tells him what he wants to hear,\u201d this person said. \u201cIf you think about Suzanne, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m running the network. The president is not running the network. And if you\u2019re Donald Trump, it\u2019s like, Damn if you are\u2014I\u2019m running the network. And, to be candid, there have been times when the network probably gave Trump too much of the idea that he was running the network.\u201d\n\nFox continues to showcase a pro-Trump lineup in its primetime hours: Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham, who often expand on the president\u2019s talking points during their shows. But under Scott, the network has ushered in a slightly more diverse set of voices. Donna Brazile, the former DNC chairwoman, is now a Fox News contributor. In 2017, the year before Scott took over as CEO, she and another senior executive, Jay Wallace, recruited Marie Harf, a former State Department spokeswoman during Barack Obama\u2019s administration, for a job as a political commentator. In giving Harf an on-air role, the Fox executives told her that they wanted different views reflected in their broadcasts, a person familiar with the matter told us. (Harf left the network to join Representative Seth Moulton\u2019s now-defunct presidential campaign.)\n\nThe person who\u2019s spoken with Scott recently told us that if the CEO is sensitive about anything, it\u2019s the criticisms of the network as propaganda\u2014not Trump\u2019s complaints. Scott started at Fox at the network\u2019s inception in 1996, working as an executive assistant to the head of programming; led the launch of Greta Van Susteren\u2019s primetime show On the Record in 2002; and went on to become network executive producer and executive vice president of programming.* Before becoming the network\u2019s first female CEO, she oversaw some of Fox\u2019s most popular opinion shows, including Fox & Friends, The Five, and Hannity. But what limited public profile she had was largely negative: After Ailes was publicly accused of sexual harassment and abuse at the company in 2016, she was alleged to have helped cover up the misbehavior. She and Fox have since moved to dismiss the suit, and she has claimed that she had \u201cno clue on what was going on\u201d in Ailes\u2019s office.", "description": "The president\u2019s recent attacks on the network barely registered inside its headquarters.", "authors": ["Elaina Plott", "Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1021263708/facebook.jpg?1567805530", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
