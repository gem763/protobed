Motherless Brooklyn is an adaptation of Jonathan Lethem\u2019s bestselling novel about a New York private detective with Tourette syndrome \u2013 Norton has been developing this for the screen pretty much ever since its publication in 1999, and it is good to see him get it over the finish line.\n\nThe Two Popes: Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce divine in papal faceoff Read more\n\nWhatever its flaws, it is a substantial and distinctive drama, unlike anything around in the cinema right now, although obviously like a lot of the gumshoe movies of yesteryear, such as The Big Sleep or The Maltese Falcon or Chinatown, with an element of a municipal graft picture like All The King\u2019s Men \u2013 and this film\u2019s producer, Warner Brothers, has been renowned for precisely this kind of gritty, violent picture since Hollywood\u2019s golden age.\n\n\n\nAnd all this is partly because Norton has taken the decision to change the late 1990s setting of the original novel and backdate it to the 1950s. There are plenty of beautiful, classic automobiles, cleaned and polished to a showroom gleam as such cars tend to be in the movies, and not dirty and scuffed-up the way they would be in real life. I regretted, in way, that Norton had not kept the original setting \u2013 watching this, I found myself remembering Rian Johnson\u2019s Brick, a pastiche hard-boiled detective story set among modern-day high school students. But perhaps this is the kind of spoof effect that Norton wanted to minimise.\n\nNorton plays Lionel Essrog, the detective with a tic that means he will convulsively yelp disjointed phrases, and jerk his head and grimace as if suddenly suppressing a huge yawn; Norton fabricates these mannerisms with care. But Lionel is also blessed with a superb memory and is good at his job. When his boss, friend and mentor Frank Minna (Bruce Willis) is killed shadowing some scary individuals, his fellow private dicks Tony (Bobby Cannavale), Gilbert (Ethan Suplee) and Danny (Dallas Roberts) are shocked but resigned; Lionel is, however, convinced Frank was on the verge of blowing open a corrupt city hall conspiracy, involving the ethnic cleansing of black people from areas ripe for lucrative redevelopment. Obsessive-compulsive Lionel believes he can piece together the clues to this mystery, involving a ruthless politician (Alec Baldwin), a local malcontent (Willem Dafoe) and a smart community activist (Gugu Mbatha-Raw).\n\n\n\nAnd so the long odyssey through the big gaunt city begins, a city depicted in sombre dark greys and browns; an odyssey punctuated by Lionel and his colleagues getting nasty beatings from goons and being carried back to the office covered in bruises and blood. Lionel periodically visits a hip Harlem jazz club (to whose existence he is alerted by the time-honoured plot device of the discovered matchbook) where his preternatural Tourette gift for scatting along with the band is noticed by the musician Michael K Williams \u2013 whose instrument suffers a very specific fate, which may tip you off as to who this is supposed to be. It\u2019s a film which piles up detail upon detail, incident upon incident, punch-up upon punch-up, all swirling in a smoky, sooty world. It all feels a bit opaque, although Alec Baldwin has a good, embittered speech right at the end. It\u2019s a heavy meal to digest, but this is a strong, vehement film with a real sense of time and place.", "description": "The actor returns to the director\u2019s chair for a respectable if heavy-going adaptation of Jonathan Lethem\u2019s best-selling crime thriller", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c9c102c4376eb573f3d2f031dd4c44ded4ff6f/100_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b33e1c47522ddb2d52cdd029ae86f851", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
