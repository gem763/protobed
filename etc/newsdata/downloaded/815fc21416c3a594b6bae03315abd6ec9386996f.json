Or things that I'm not just asked to do or really that interested in living in a green screen.'\n\nWhen broached with the subject of how much the movie business has changed, she responded by saying how much she yearned 'to have the era of Meg Ryan come back.'\n\nBack to TV: Aniston says the current the state of movies, and the quality of streaming services, inspired her return to TV to star in the Apple TV+ series The Morning Show\n\nBack in the day: The 50-year-old actress added that she's also 'kind of sad' that time-specific TV, like her hit sitcom Friends, is all but extinct; she is pictured with her Friends co-stars\n\nEven though she's now on-board with what streaming services can provide, in terms of quality and availability, Aniston added that she's also 'kind of sad' that time-specific TV is all but extinct.\n\n'I'm shocked this is where we are, but excited that this is where we are. I didn't see it coming. I remember not understanding. What the hell does streaming mean? They're like, it's there all the time.'\n\nAniston's comments came just days after Scorsese gave his hard-hitting comments about the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n'I don't see them. I tried, you know? But that's not cinema,' the Taxi Driver director told Empire magazine.\n\n'Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.'\n\nHis take: Aniston's comments came just days after legendary director Martin Scorsese said Marvel movies are not cinema, and compared the billion-dollar juggernaut to a theme park\n\nA number of actors and filmmakers have since spoken out on the topic, many of whom defended the superhero genre.\n\n'I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ (1988, starring Willem Defoe) without having seen the film,' Guardians Of The Galaxy director James Gunn shared on Twitter.\n\n'I'm saddened that he's now judging my films in the same way. That said, I will always love Scorsese, be grateful for his contributions to cinema.'\n\nToy Story co-writer Joss Whedon added: 'It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being. I first think of @JamesGunn, how his heart & guts are packed into GOTG. I revere Marty, & I do see his point, but... Well there's a reason why I'm always angry.'", "description": "Her comments come days after Martin Scorsese compared the MCU to a 'theme park.'", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/02/19642158-0-image-a-20_1570929070242.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
