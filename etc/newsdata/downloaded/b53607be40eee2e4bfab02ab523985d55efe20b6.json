It was a good price. The price probably reflected the changing market \u2013 it was a lot more positive than we\u2019ve seen.\n\nWhat did you think it would go for? I thought it might be around $1.8 million.\n\nWhat was surprising about it? The vendors were hoping to get someone with a commercial angle - generally they pay more. But in this changing market the family who\u2019s frustrated at the lack of stock is willing to pay more than most people.\n\nThere were three clear-cut options. Bidder #1 was a couple looking to do a renovation and flip it. Bidder #2 was a couple looking to do a side-by-side [townhouse development] which was approved. Bidder #3, the winner, was a family looking to put a family home on there.\n\nThe winning bidder, a family owner-occupier, beat two rivals who wanted to develop the site commercially.\n\nHow did the auction play out?\n\nIt had a mediocre start. People were finding their way. Then it really caught some wind once the third bidder got involved. It moved quite quickly and really took off with very strong bidding, back and forth. There was not a huge amount of think time.\n\nWhen did it drop from three bidders to two?\n\nAround the $1.87 million-mark. The final increments were in the $5000s and $1000s. It was a bit of mixed bag. They were [both final bidders] trying to lay out couple of knock-out punches, they tried and slowed down, determined not to stop on an even number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood bidding doesn\u2019t stop on an even number. \u2014 Agent Matt Cleverdon\n\nSome people will say \u201cI\u2019ve got $1.9 million to spend\u201d. So if you bid $1,901,000, you might get it with that last $1000. Good bidding doesn\u2019t stop on an even number.\n\nThe side-by-side [developer buyers] tried to go with a knock-out punch. They put up about $7000 at the end. They stopped at $1,910,000. The family bidder said \u201cI won\u2019t stop on an even number. I\u2019ll give it one last shot\u201d. And that was enough to get it. They won by $1000.\n\nThey said they had been looking for \u201cquite a few months\u201d and had been unsuccessful at a couple of other auctions. They potentially thought stock levels would be increasing, but they just hadn\u2019t seen that. That\u2019s forcing some of the prices up we\u2019ve seen recently.\n\nDo you reckon we\u2019ll see another result like this: a) next week b) next year c) next cycle d) never?\n\na) Next week. We\u2019ve seen a few of these recently. It\u2019s a market shifting for these family dwellings.", "description": "In a time of low stock, frustrated owner-occupiers are even giving developers a hard run.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1908%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/984ee73a520a12ac6d2fad99589e2c1cd602f88e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
