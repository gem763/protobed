The\n\n10-year U.S. Treasuries yield was flat at 1.506% .\n\nGlobal shares face headwinds from tariffs Washington and\n\nBeijing slapped on each other.\n\nThe United States began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of\n\nChinese goods on Sunday and China began imposing new duties on\n\nU.S. crude oil, the latest escalation in their trade war.\n\nAlthough U.S. President Donald Trump has said both sides\n\nwould still meet for talks later this month, tensions have shown\n\nlittle sign of abating.\n\nChina said on Monday has lodged a complaint against the\n\nUnited States at the World Trade Organization over U.S. import\n\nduties, trashing the latest tariff actions as violating the\n\nconsensus reached by leaders of China and the United States in a\n\nmeeting in Osaka.\n\n\"We have so many problems around the world, starting from\n\nthe U.S.-China trade war and Brexit. But investors appear to be\n\ngetting used to be exposed to them,\" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior\n\nstrategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management\n\n\"No one really thinks Washington and Beijing will solve the\n\nissues. But as long as the U.S. economy keeps going, stock\n\nprices will have limited downside,\" he said.\n\nU.S. manufacturing survey by the Institute for Supply\n\nManagement (ISM) due at 1400 GMT Tuesday is a major focus for\n\ninvestors.\n\nAlthough U.S. manufacturing activity has been slowing in\n\nrecent months, the ISM's index has so far stayed above 50, which\n\nseparates contraction and growth.\n\nIn the currency market, sterling traded at $1.2063 GBP=D4 ,\n\nlittle changed so far on Tuesday after having dropped 0.85% on\n\nMonday. The currency stood just a half cent above its 2 1/2-year\n\nlow of $1.2015 hit on Aug. 12.\n\nPrime Minister Johnson implicitly warned lawmakers on Monday\n\nthat he would seek an election if they tied his hands on Brexit,\n\nruling out ever countenancing a further delay to Britain's\n\ndeparture from the European Union. Uncertainties over Brexit have already hit the UK economy,\n\nwith survey by the IHS Markit/CIPS showing British manufacturing\n\ncontracted last month at the fastest rate in seven years.\n\nThe picture is not much better in Europe and the European\n\nCentral Bank is widely expected to cut interest rates next week\n\nto cushion the blow, pressuring the euro.\n\nThe common currency fell to a two-year low of $1.09555\n\nin early Tuesday trade.\n\nThe offshore Chinese yuan also dropped to a record low of\n\n7.1975 per dollar CNH= while the Australian dollar fetched\n\n$0.67145 AUD=D4 , not far from a decade-low of $0.66775 hit\n\nlast month.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep its policy\n\non hold on Tuesday, though many market players expect an\n\ninterest rate cut next month.\n\nArgentine bond prices fell to record lows on Monday and the\n\nofficial and black market pesos diverged after the country\n\nimposed capital controls in a bid to stem a currency rout that\n\nis sharpening the risk of default. The peso ARS=RASL closed 0.88% stronger in official\n\nmarkets, but closed 0.79% weaker in the black market at 63.5 per\n\ndollar.\n\nOil prices were also dented by concerns over the trade war.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.76% to\n\n$54.68 per barrel.\n\n\n\n(Editing by Richard Borsuk)\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks hurt by trade war, pound hit by no-deal Brexit fears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg"}
