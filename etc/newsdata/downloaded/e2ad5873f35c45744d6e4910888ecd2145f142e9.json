They put it into their work,\u201d said Williams.\n\n\u201cSo, the next time a woman \u2015 and especially a woman of color, because she stands to make fifty-two cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart \u2015 tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her. Believe her, because one day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\u201d\n\nThe actor dedicated the award to her daughter, Matilda, and received a standing ovation from the crowd. Throughout her speech, the screen cut to Philipps, Williams\u2019 longtime friend, who was tearing up at Williams\u2019 words.\n\nThe former host of \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d was not the only one moved by Williams\u2019 speech. Twitter was abuzz with praise:\n\nTerrific group of nominees, but Michelle Williams was really outstanding in 'Fosse/Verdon.'
