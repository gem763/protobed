British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists his country will leave at the end of the month with or without an agreement, although U.K. lawmakers are determined to push for another delay rather than risk a chaotic no-deal Brexit.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said at a meeting of the bloc\u2019s ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday that the main challenge now is to turn the new British proposals on the complex Irish border issue into something legally binding. EU member Ireland has a land border with the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland, and both want to keep goods and people flowing freely across the island.\n\n____\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 European Union and British negotiators failed to reach a breakthrough in Brexit talks during a frantic all-night session and will continue", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/08bf95_luxembourg-europe-brexit-60684-european-union-chief-brexit-negotiator-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
