It\u2019s offensive and can perpetuate damaging preconceptions about marginalised groups.\n\nAnd, for the record, dressing in blackface for Halloween is straight-up racist. So just don\u2019t do it.\n\nIn recent years \u2013 probably since that iconic parade scene in Spectre in 2015 \u2013 Halloween costumes inspired by the Mexican celebration Dia de los Muertos have become really popular.\n\nThe cultural holiday, also known as Day of the Dead, is a traditional celebration in Mexico where people honour the lives of loved ones who have died.\n\nIt has meaning and cultural significance, so to dress up in sugar skull makeup without understanding any of the history is disrespectful and pretty insulting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is a way to get involved with this celebration and appreciate the culture \u2013 without appropriating. It just involves making some more thoughtful decisions.\n\nFirst of all \u2013 find a celebration that\u2019s actually run by Mexican people. Mexican Londoner Paola Feregrino is involved in organising a night at The Book Club in Shoreditch and she has some tips to avoid offending anyone.\n\n\u2018Dia de los Muertos is different from Halloween \u2013 it celebrates the dead rather than being afraid of the dead,\u2019 says Paola.\n\n\u2018Most people think of death as something grim, depressing and simply, something we don\u2019t really talk about.\n\n\u2018For us Mexicans it\u2019s different: of course, we get sad when a loved one passes away but we love remembering them at their best, after all, that\u2019s what they would\u2019ve wanted.\n\n\u2018Take this as an opportunity to learn and engage with Latin culture\u2019 (Picture: Paola Feregrino)\n\n\u2018So on Day of the Dead, we honour those loved ones that passed away, could be your granny, your mother or even your favourite singer who is no longer with us.\u2019\n\nPaola says that on Dia de los Muertos, it is traditional to call to the souls of deceased loved ones with a \u2018shrine\u2019.\n\n\u2018We celebrate them with their favourite music, food, drink, flowers and objects. We dance, we paint our faces to connect to them and be with them for the day. As long as they are remembered, they are still with us.\u2019\n\nPaola says that in order to celebrate and enjoy the day without appropriating the culture, it is important to have a real understanding of the history behind the holiday and engage on a more than superficial level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Join the festivities by visiting museums, watching documentaries, or attending local parades and events,\u2019 suggests Paola.\n\n\u2018Take this as an opportunity to learn and engage with Latin culture.\n\n\u2018If you want to go to a party, firstly find out if the event is curated by a Mexican, they will be on hand proudly inviting you to remember, to see, to listen, and to connect with those in your heart that have passed.\n\n\u2018When a loved one passes away but we love remembering them at their best\u2019 (Picture: Paola Feregrino)\n\n\u2018Remember, do be happy, as at Dia de los Muertos we remember the best moments we spent with those on the other side, that is why they are welcome to party too.\n\n\u2018Write some poetry! In Mexico, traditionally, people write small funny poems of those loved who are no longer with us. You can put out that poem with a photo and candles at home for your own little shrine.\u2019\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget, there are plenty of costume options that don\u2019t reference anybody else\u2019s culture \u2013 so maybe stick to the classic toilet roll mummy if you really want to avoid any potential cultural faux pas.\n\nThe Book Club\u2019s Day of the Dead Party is on Saturday 26 October.\n\nOrganised by Mexican-London group Axolotl, the night will feature DJ sets with Mexican and Latinx vibes to get you dancing the night away plus an immersive storytelling experience.\n\nMORE: Woman who\u2019s had bum lifts and lip fillers wants to look like Barbie without plastic surgery\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me to pick a side \u2013 I am mixed-race, so I am both\u2019\n\nMORE: Losing a baby is hard for dads too\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Tips on how to celebrate Mexican Day of the Dead without culturally appropriating this Halloween - hint, you have to actually engage.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/day-of-the-dead-comp_1570619925.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
