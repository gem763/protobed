To them, \u201cdeplorables\u201d are what\u2019s wrong with America. Yes, they\u2019re the advantaged, homophobic, capitalistic, gun-loving, God-fearing patriots who need to get out of the way for America to be transformed into the democratic socialist republic it must become! But doing interventions may prove to be more of a challenge than they think!\n\nDeprogrammer: We\u2019ve brought you here for your own good. We want to free you from your irrational, cult-like support for Trump. It will involve a certain amount of retraining and\u2026\n\nPatriot: I don\u2019t need retraining. God, family, and country give me all the solid foundation I need.\n\nDeprogrammer: Yes, of course, there is God! As a Christian, how can you support Trump? Aren\u2019t you to love your neighbor, not cut them off from government support?\n\nPatriot: Of course, and, like Trump, I care enough to encourage every citizen to become less dependent on government and more self-sufficient and successful. I want them to find their own God-given skills and use them to pursue their own American dream. And like Trump, I want them to keep most of the reward for their efforts.\n\nDeprogrammer: Spare me the tired talking points. You know far too many Americans will never experience financial success.\n\nPatriot: You will find that I have my own opinions. We don\u2019t need talking points. We know that you don\u2019t have to be rich to be successful or satisfied. That\u2019s the trouble with the left. The left actually believes people can\u2019t be successful on their own without government help. Trump believes in America and ALL its people\u2014no matter what their race, gender, age, politics, or sexual orientation. He knows that small business is the engine that keeps America growing and prosperous. All you need is to find a need and fill it. When you do something better, faster, or in a new way, the American Dream will still work for anyone willing to work hard to make it happen. Even you!\n\nDeprogrammer: We\u2019re not here to talk about me, but you. You know very well that the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is an illusion most never achieve.\n\nPatriot: You spend too much time in Washington. Most Americans earn their success the old-fashioned way\u2014hard work. They make their own luck and take advantage of setbacks to turn them into opportunities. They aren\u2019t victims; they\u2019re survivors that find a way to make enough to take care of their families and their future. They even know how to have some fun along the way! They finally have a president who is looking out for them. Their hope for the future isn\u2019t based on the special interest hustlers who populate Washington. Their optimism is earned from overcoming obstacles themselves and their belief that they can do that over and over again.\n\nDeprogrammer: Easily said by a white man born to a life of advantage. You\u2019ve never experienced the hardships of slavery or the hardship of immigration. Your successful because you won the lottery\u2014rewards whites never truly deserved.\n\nPatriot: Yes, I was born white, and my ancestors weren\u2019t slaves, but they didn\u2019t have it easy either. My ancestors came here with next to nothing but worked their dreams. As for me, I started my own company from nothing and work long hours to make it successful. Too many on the left look for excuses to justify living as victims. They play the blame game while others get busy working to achieve their own success.\n\nDeprogrammer: Most blacks\u2026\n\nPatriot: Don\u2019t start. Most black Americans living today know nothing of slavery or the racism of the past. As a child, I lived in the racist south. Today, is nothing like that! When black immigrants come to America today, they don\u2019t seem to experience racism to the same degree or let it stop them. They\u2019ve come for the opportunity and want to keep more of the rewards for their hard work. They don\u2019t demonstrate; they get busy making their dreams a reality. More citizens should follow their example.\n\nDeprogrammer: So you have no guilt! You think reparations for slavery is but a talking point used by black victims. How heartless can you be?\n\nPatriot: I have sympathy for those who actually were slaves, but not for generations of many black Americans who have allowed themselves to become dependent on government entitlements. They\u2019re trapping themselves on a modern-day plantation that has limited their potential!\n\nDeprogrammer: I suppose you have no sympathy for the LGBTdemands for equality.\n\nPatriot: They don\u2019t want or need sympathy. They deserve the same rights as any American, no matter what the race, gender, sexual preference. But they deserve no more special treatment from government than any other group. Calling Trump and Republicans racists or homophobes doesn\u2019t allow us to come together to confront those who truly are. Trump and his supporters no more condone white nationalists than Obama supporters affirm Antifa\u2019s actions. We should all shame extremists and stand together in support of freedom and opportunity for all citizens.\n\nDeprogrammer: Government programs support the needy, and yet you see no justification for them!\n\nPatriot: I believe the needy are best handled by family, friends, charities, and local governments. Let them be connected to services that fit their unique situation. That face-to-face contact helps create caring communities. It also helps weed out those conning the system. Americans are there to help, but that\u2019s best handled locally.\n\nDeprogrammer: You get Social Security. Isn\u2019t that an entitlement?\n\nPatriot: Social Security is not welfare; Americans pay into it. Unfortunately, politicians just used those funds instead of setting that money aside to pay for what they owe us seniors. Now they want Medicare for all; it will destroy an already underfunded benefit. Besides, you miss the point. The goal of government should be to get people off entitlements and into self-sufficiency, not trap them into dependence. But then again, the left requires dependence to get votes.\n\nDeprogrammer: Enough for today. You obviously are resistant to accepting the truth and still have much to learn.\n\nPatriot: The left never learns!", "description": "The following is an imagined scenario:Since President Trump and his .09/02/2019 3:14:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Terry Paulson", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/233/0d74ddee-c97d-4fda-9e0b-ba8a7b7df3ab.png"}
