Next week, Jews around the world will observe Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, with a roughly 25-hour period of fasting and intensive prayer. Most non-Jews (and maybe even some Jews), however, are unaware the history of Yom Kippur, its purpose, or, most surprising of all, its influence on Christianity.\n\nThe biblical basis for the Day of Atonement can be found in Leviticus 16, which describes a series of religious rituals and animal sacrifices that had to be performed in the Jerusalem Temple in order to keep the Temple clean. Ritual sacrifices were offered year round so it\u2019s strange that a special day was required, but Yom Kippur was something like a religious deep clean.\n\nProfessor Liane Feldman, who teaches in the department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at NYU, explained that \u201canything that slipped through the cracks or hasn\u2019t been cleaned up yet or can\u2019t be cleaned up by regular [sacrificial] offerings is taken care of by a series of five sacrifices offered on this day.\u201d The reason behind the obsession with ritual cleanliness is that the Temple was the home of God. As Feldman puts it. \u201cthe Israelite God cannot live in an impure place.\u201d If the Temple gets too dirty then there\u2019s the risk that God might leave (which is a thing that God actually does in Ezekiel).", "description": "It is largely glossed over that early Christians used Yom Kippur to explain both why it was that people needed saving, and how the death of Jesus could save other people.", "authors": ["Candida Moss"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570480553/191007-moss-christianity-yom-kippur-tease_gbplof", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
