Juul is also under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, and several state attorneys general. Walmart said last week it will end sales of the e-cig products.\n\nThe FTC is looking into whether Juul used social-media influencers and forms of marketing to pitch its product to minors, while the FDA is considering several issues including the high nicotine content of Juul's refill pods.\n\nThe Trump administration also announced this month that it plans to ban most flavored e-cigarettes. \"We can't allow people to get sick,\" Trump told reporters. \"And we can't have our kids be so affected.\"\n\nEarlier this month Business Insider reported that the US FDA criticized Juul for portraying its e-cigs as \"totally safe\" as it marketed them to children.\n\nAs \"Chief Growth Officer\" at Altria Group, Crosthwaite \"oversaw the company's expansion into alternatives to combustible cigarettes and played a key role in the commercial and regulatory efforts related to the US launch of IQOS,\" Juul said. He was also an \"observer\" on Juul Labs' board of directors.\n\n\"In his new role, Crosthwaite and the entire Juul Labs leadership team will continue a broad review of the company's practices and policies to ensure alignment with its aim of responsible leadership within the industry,\" the company said in the statement on its website.\n\nThe FDA warned Juul in September 9 letter: \"Referring to your ENDS products as '99% safer' than cigarettes, 'much safer' than cigarettes, 'totally safe,' and 'a safer alternative than smoking cigarettes' is particularly concerning because these statements were made directly to children in school.\"\n\nBurns, in an interview with CBS in August, warned against the use of using Juul's products. Burns at the time said that anyone who was not already using nicotine should not use Juul products due to the addictive nature of the drug.\n\n\"Don't vape. Don't use Juul,\" Burns told Tony Dokoupil, adding \"Don't start using nicotine if you don't have a preexisting relationship with nicotine.\"", "description": "Juul just announced in a statement on its website that the Kevin Burns, CEO of the e-cigarette company has stepped down from the role.
