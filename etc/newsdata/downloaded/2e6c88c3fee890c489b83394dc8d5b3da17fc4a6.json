Mutko is apparently on the verge of passing that test even though he has already been cited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for his alleged role in Russian doping.\n\nThe result of the vetting process, by FIFA's review committee, will be announced by European football body UEFA because Mutko is one of their candidates for the FIFA role.\n\nHis case has been examined by the panel's chairman Miguel Poiares Maduro, a former Portuguese government minister, his deputy Mukul Mudgal of India and Peru's Felipe Cantuarias.\n\nOn Saturday night, a senior governance expert with inside knowledge of the FIFA administration was scathing at the prospect of Mutko being cleared.\n\n'Other people have failed integrity tests for far less than what Mutko is accused of,' he said. 'It seems pretty clear he was part of the [doping] system and if you are under serious suspicion, that needs to be seriously vetted. The fact is FIFA's governance system has imploded. It's one big sham.'\n\nThe notion that Mutko is innocent of doping will be challenged by these new allegations he effectively silenced Pishchalnikova.\n\nMultiple sources allege Mutko ordered Darya Pishchalnikova to retract secret evidence\n\nHow the Mail on Sunday has led the way\n\nRussia has always vehemently denied running a state-sponsored doping programme, first exposed by this newspaper in July 2013 when we named lab boss Grigory Rodchenkov as central to the plot. The MoS revealed at the time that senior coaches were involved in doping and cover-ups across multiple sports.\n\nPishchalnikova, a discus thrower, won a silver medal at London 2012 but was later told she had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs for the second time in her career. She responded by writing to WADA and the governing body of athletics, the IAAF, in late 2012. Her letter, seen by The MoS, named Russia's athletics federation president Valentin Balakhnichev, coaches Valentin Maslakov and Alexei Melnikov and Rodchenkov among those involved in a doping scam.\n\nThree separate sources with knowledge of events have told The MoS that Pishchalnikova was ordered to meet Mutko in early 2013. WADA had sent her letters to Russia's authorities believing they would sort out the problem.\n\nA letter written by Pishchalnikova in 2012 named Valentin Balakhnichev among those involved\n\nTwo sources are whistleblowers involved in this newspaper's original expos\u00e9 \u2014 one a coach, the other a lawyer. Another is close to the athlete. Separately, former Russian anti-doping official and whistleblower Vitaly Stepanov has told The MoS his own sources recounted the same version of events.\n\n'That's the story I heard,' Stepanov said, adding that Pishchalnikova now avoids any mention inside Russia about related issues. 'It sounds like she is enjoying her life,' Stepanov says. 'She doesn't talk about doping.'\n\nIt is alleged Mutko told Pishchalnikova that 'the president' [Putin] needed the Moscow anti-doping lab 'for the Olympics' and her testimony to WADA should be withdrawn. Sources allege Pishchalnikova initially declined to do as requested, but agreed after being told she faced a life ban if she failed to help Mutko, and a 10-year ban if she helped. Pishchalnikova ended up with a 10-year ban.\n\nIt is alleged she declined to do as requested, and was eventually handed a 10-year ban\n\nShe did not respond to a request for comment about Mutko's role. It is believed she feels she has been a victim of the system once already and sees no benefit in commenting.\n\nHer family's view is perhaps reflected by the fact that Pishchalnikova's mother, Tatiana, last year signed an online petition calling for Mutko to be sacked when he was sports minister.\n\nIt read: 'Mutko's work as a minister compromises Russian sport, puts children and teenagers off sports and causes huge damage to the image of our country in the world.'\n\nMutko (right) is currently standing for re-election to the all-powerful FIFA council\n\nThe petition makes reference to the fact that independent reports have named Mutko as knowledgeable about and complicit in doping.\n\nThe MoS sent detailed questions to both Russia's Ministry of Sport \u2014 where Mutko was in charge in 2013 \u2014 and to his current office of Mutko as deputy PM.\n\nSports Ministry spokeswoman Lyudmila Derevyanko said in a statement: 'All your questions concern Vitaly Leontiyevich Mutko. We have nothing to say about this, so we have passed them to his office in the government.'\n\nAn official at Mutko's office said by telephone: 'No one can dictate to the deputy prime minister when he should answer something', and then hung up.\n\nMutko watches the downhill ski competition at the 2014 Winter Paralympics with Putin\n\nStepanov, who worked for years at Russia's anti-doping agency (RUSADA) before revealing the truth and fleeing the country for his own safety, is certain Mutko played a key role in the doping conspiracy.\n\n'He was minister [of sport] at the time and he couldn't stay in his position if [Russia's poor performance at the 2010 Winter Olympics in] Vancouver happened again.\n\n'During my time at RUSADA I could see people loyal to him put into important positions.\n\n'The guy was clearly setting us his own agenda. The guy must be banned from sports for life. There is no discussion. He destroys Olympic values.\n\n'This happens not only in Russia. That's how he justifies it. \"I'm not the only one\".'\n\nAdditional reporting: ANDREW WARSHAW", "description": "SPECIAL REPORT BY NICK HARRIS: The man who led Russia's 2018 World Cup bid and a key ally of Vladimir Putin is facing a new scandal over claims he silenced a drugs whistleblower.", "authors": ["Nick Harris For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/18/21/02752FD4000007D0-0-image-a-43_1487452923194.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-18"}
