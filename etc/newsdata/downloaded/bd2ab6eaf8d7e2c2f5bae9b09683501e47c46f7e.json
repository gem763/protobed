At Discovery Health, CEO Adrian Gore changed medical aid by incentivising good health choices rather than building a business on insuring against illness, the traditional model.\n\nIt has paid off handsomely and now Discovery Bank is going to try to make South Africans think about their money differently by rewarding good financial behaviour. It\u2019s going to be a tough ride.\n\nSouth Africans are highly indebted with the worst savings levels compared across a basket of similarly sized economies.\n\nIn addition, most of us are short-term about money \u2013 we want what we want right now.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, the Human Sciences Research Council found that many South Africans are present-biased, lacking financial self-control and prioritising instant gratification,\u201d says Discovery in its presentation on the Bank. Present bias means the need for instant gratification. The majority of respondents in the HSRC study signed up to statements like, \u201cI find it more satisfying to spend money than to save it for the long term\u201d; \u201cI tend to live for today and let tomorrow take care of itself\u201d and \u201cMoney is there to be spent\u201d.\n\nThis happy-go-lucky South African style also means that many of us think we are better off than we are. Discovery\u2019s research found that 64% of members with poor financial health thought theirs was good; 63% felt in control of their financial health although their personal finance did not prove this while the levels of unsecured (short-term) debt they carried was very high.\n\nDiscovery Bank is going to incentivise five key and controllable behaviours \u2013 to get customers to spend less than they earn; to save regularly; to insure for emergencies; to pay off property and to invest for the long-term. The bank\u2019s research has shown that South Africans who sit with unaffordable debt levels, who cannot fund an unexpected event and who have insufficient retirement income are responsible for \u201c80% of events where people are not able to meet financial obligations\u201d.\n\nDiscovery Bank has built products (transaction and/or credit card accounts) based on both income and Vitality financial health indicators which place you on a hierarchy of achievement. This level of status determines the percentage rewards back on travel, entertaining and certain categories of retail shopping as well as your interest rates.\n\nSavings and instant gratification\n\nHumans respond well to rewards, as Discovery has shown in its health and insurance products, and it is banking on the same psychology to drive behaviour change. Can it make a national impact on low savings and the culture of instant gratification?\n\nIf Discovery\u2019s history is anything to go by, then yes. There are numerous studies to show that Discovery\u2019s Gold and Diamond members (the top health level) have lower claims histories and better health outcomes than other medical aid members. They make up a growing complement of members and other medical aids have iterated similar schemes \u2013 behaviour change has become the norm, rather than the exception. This is Discovery\u2019s shared value model which it describes as a simple idea that \u201cbusiness models can and should address social issues at a profit, meaning they create shared value by linking the company\u2019s success with individual client benefit and large-scale social progress\u201d.\n\nDiscovery Bank is going to start small and slowly so ramping up to large-scale social progress is a way down the road. The Bank\u2019s got a ready market. All the consumers who own the Discovery Card can migrate to Discovery Bank over time; staff members who have been testing the system in beta have reported that the transition is seamless. And then there is the larger market of Discovery medical aid members who will have cross-functionality. In this, Discovery is building an Apple-like model which locks you in to a variety of products with convenience and incentives. You will, for example, as a Discovery Health and Bank customer have your medical aid co-payments automatically made so no queuing time.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting and innovative model but is it sufficiently tapped into South African realities like the Gini Coefficient, the high levels of wealth inequality which means that often working people don\u2019t save, not because they do not want to, but because they are supporting high numbers of dependents? In a country with as high an unemployment rate as South Africa\u2019s, these levels are extremely high and can mitigate against sensible decision-making as much as the culture of instant gratification does.", "description": "Capitec shook up South Africa\u2019s staid and conservative banking culture with the revolutionary premise that banks existed primarily to serve their customers, not their shareholders.", "authors": ["Ferial Haffajee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8136/f55e22003a6340fab6b01add762f4c4b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-26"}
