Add Democratic Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Democratic Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThat new frontrunner took the harshest attacks Tuesday night. Yet Sen. Elizabeth Warren was targeted mostly over old disagreements -- with fireworks that illuminated familiar ground, or that created what Sen. Cory Booker called \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, took no criticism from his rivals over the issues involving his son that have dominated the news in the month since the last debate, and virtually no attacks on matters of policy.\n\nThe Democratic candidates shredded President Donald Trump on foreign policy and whether he should be impeached. But they mainly fell back to sparring among themselves over narrow policy disagreements.\n\nAs she was at previous debates and in numerous interviews, Warren was pressed on whether taxes will go up on middle-class families under her Medicare-for-all plan. She ducked a direct answer by saying her plan would, on the whole, \u201clower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg saw an opening: \u201cWe heard it tonight: A yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar also got in on the action: \u201cYou are making Republican talking points, right here in this room,\u201d she told Warren.\n\nAnd Biden piled on: \u201cThe plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more, on a yearly basis, than the entire federal budget.\u201d\n\nThat issue was among those that reveal the ideological and attitudinal splits that continue to define the campaign. Some of the disagreements seemed a bit forced; Sen. Kamala Harris spent a few minutes picking a fight with Warren about whether Trump should have his Twitter account suspended.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWarren sought to turn the argument against her policies on its head, when pressed on whether an additional tax on the wealthy is a politically wise approach to addressing income inequality.\n\n\u201cMy question is not why do Bernie [Sanders] and I support a wealth tax,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's why is it - does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar shot back: \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d she said, in a reference to businessman Tom Steyer, who was appearing at his first debate. \u201cSimply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke criticized Warren for not putting out a more specific tax plan: \u201cI think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.\u201d\n\nBooker chimed in to say that those sorts of attacks will hurt the Democratic Party: \u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable. I have seen this script before. It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe debate also showcased a sharp disagreement between O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg \u2013 two candidates vying for a similar swath of voters - on guns. O\u2019Rourke accused Buttigieg of excessive caution in avoiding a mandatory buyback of assault-style guns.\n\n\u201cLet's decide what we are going to believe in, and what we\u2019re going to achieve,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nButtigieg shot back: \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\nWin Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nThe candidates treaded gingerly around issues involving Biden\u2019s son and his business arrangements, an issue that was only raised briefly by the debate\u2019s moderators.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s interview with ABC News dominated the pre-debate discussion, after his acknowledgment that taking a job with a Ukrainian energy company was probably a \u201cmistake\u201d because of the way it opened his father to political attacks.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats seemed wary to be seen as going where Trump wants to lead them. And Biden sought to turn the conversation to Trump himself.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in the Ukraine,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption \u2013 that\u2019s what we should be focused on.\u201d\n\nBooker jumped in the debate later to defend Biden \u2013 even though nobody was attacking him.\n\nDiscussing Hunter Biden\u2019s work at all amounts to \u201celevating a lie and attacking a statesman,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThat was so offensive. The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump took more than his share of attacks. Buttigieg tangled with his fellow veteran on stage, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, to argue that Trump was \u201cundermining the honor of our soldiers\u201d in withdrawing US troops from northern Syria.\n\nAnd the first debate since the House launched an impeachment inquiry brought strikingly similar sentiments from the candidates.\n\n\u201cTrump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cThis president is the most corrupt president in modern history, and I think all of history,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cHe is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had,\u201d said Harris. \u201cDude gotta go,\u201d she added later in the debate.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate here is more decent, more coherent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House,\u201d Steyer said.\n\nYet Tuesday\u2019s debate felt disconnected from the wild news cycles that have brought near-daily revelations contributing to an impeachment inquiry, and a developing foreign-policy crisis in the Middle East.\n\nA party more focused than ever on defeating Trump spent an evening where candidates primarily argued over how to defeat each other.\n\nThe record 12 candidates on stage agreed on the urgency of defeating Trump. Yet they seem to think \u2013 perhaps rightly \u2013 that the Democratic primary will turn on narrower issues, even as momentum shifts in the race.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
