She woke up in the office at 3am in the morning and she had passed out on a sofa. He was asleep on the sofa next to her.\n\n'Having woken up, she began to gather her things together and the defendant woke up. The defendant then began asking her if she was on the Pill.\n\n'She asked him what he was talking about and he told her they had had sex.\n\n'The defendant then joked with her about how she could lay claim to having had sex in Parliament.'\n\nThe court heard that the alleged victim still does not know whether they had sex.\n\nThe pair had met a few months previously when the student did a trial week's work in Westminster before she went to university.\n\nMiss Farrelly said: 'She had an interest in politics and in fact she was already involved in her local Conservative Party and was already involved as a case-worker for her local MP. Her plan at that time was to go to university in London and continue to work in Westminster as a parliamentary assistant.'\n\nBut the alleged victim became concerned about parliamentary gossip after Warren allegedly pursued her throughout 2017, trying to kiss her on multiple occasions.\n\nJurors heard that Warren shoved the teenager against a wall in an underpass and assaulted her.\n\nWarren was a researcher for Kingswood MP Chris Skidmore who was recently appointed Minister of State for universities, science, research and innovation\n\nA month later he is said to have followed her back to her boss's office and sexually assaulted her after another work event.\n\nMiss Farrelly said: 'The defendant closed the door, turned off the lights and then pushed the woman against the wall and started kissing her. She tried to push him off her but he insisted and kept trying to kiss and grab her.\n\n'She told police while all of this was going on, she was crying hysterically.\n\n'The defendant, however, did not stop there. The prosecution say that he then turned her around and pushed her down into a chair she was still crying. Having pushed her into the chair, he then opened her legs. She kept pushing him off and eventually she was able to push him hard enough to get him off her.\n\n'She was in such a panic to leave that she left behind her pass to get into Houses of Parliament and some of her belongings.' The court heard that Warren then taunted her at a Tube station.\n\nThe alleged victim's mother persuaded her to tell her boss, who cannot be named for legal reasons.\n\nIn a police interview recording played to the court, the young woman said: 'He came on to me and tried to take it further and I was like, 'no, absolutely not, we're going to work together'. And then he said, 'you're the first girl to ever turn me down, no girl's ever done this to me'.'\n\nWarren, who no longer works for Mr Skidmore, denies three counts of sexual assault and one of sexual assault by penetration. The trial continues.", "description": "Callum Warren, 27, is accused of assaulting the 17-year-old girl while she was working as a parliamentary assistant for a Tory MP.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20291720-0-image-a-2_1572286544423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
