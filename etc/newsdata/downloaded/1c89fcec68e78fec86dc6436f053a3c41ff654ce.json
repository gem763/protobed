And, he suggests, the modern medical definition is being shaken by new scientific developments.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat at the beginning of the 20th century was irreversible \u2014 cessation of breathing \u2014 became reversible by the end of the century. Is it too difficult to contemplate that the same may be true for brain death? A recent experiment suggests this idea is not just a wild imagining.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKoch is referring to a series of surprising experiments in which scientists managed to restore some function in the brains of pigs that had been dead for hours. The research, which was published this April in the journal Nature, sparked intense ethical and scientific debate. It seems to point to death as a process, not an event, and raises the possibility that one day scientists will be able to completely revive a dead brain.\n\nIf you think the research sounds Frankenstein-like, you\u2019re not alone. Even the scientists who conducted the experiments grappled with the ethical conundrum it presented, and had a plan B in which they\u2019d stop the experiment immediately if the brains presented evidence of consciousness. Luckily for them, they didn\u2019t \u2014 but that could change one day as research progresses.\n\nAD\n\nKoch grapples with that ethical conundrum, and the freaky realities of what our bodies can do even when our brains aren\u2019t online. The article isn\u2019t horror movie fodder or Halloween-themed . . . but it\u2019s well-timed if you\u2019re in the mood for some seriously chilling science.\n\nAD", "description": "The shifting concept of death is tracked, from the cessation of breathing to the end of brain activity, in an article for Scientific American.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e23pe52b-RXX3eOiKI0BpgxzlB0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYAB4QXLVAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
