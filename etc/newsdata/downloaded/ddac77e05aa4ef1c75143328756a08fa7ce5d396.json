If only Lindsey Graham & Co. were as eager to defend our democracy as they are the Kurds. But I digress.\n\nIf you think Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria will make the Middle East more explosive , you\u2019re correct. But there\u2019s far more going on. Those troops were also interrupting Iran\u2019s efforts to build a land bridge from Tehran to Beirut to tighten a noose around Israel \u2014 and their removal could help bring the Iran-Israel shadow war out into the open. This is the really big story in the Middle East today.\n\nHere\u2019s the background: In the early hours of Sept. 14 , the Iranian Air Force launched roughly 20 drones and cruise missiles at one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important oil fields and processing facilities. The drones and cruise missiles flew so low and with such stealth that neither their takeoff nor their impending attack was detected in time by Saudi or U.S. radar. The pro-Iranian Houthi militia in Yemen claimed responsibility for the raid. That was as believable as saying that Santa Claus did it.\n\nSome Israeli strategists argue that this surprise attack was the Middle East\u2019s \u201cPearl Harbor.\u201d An exaggeration?
