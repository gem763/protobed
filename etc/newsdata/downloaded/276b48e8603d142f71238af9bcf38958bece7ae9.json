But many in the former British colony say the Communist Party is chipping away at the autonomy promised when it was returned to Beijing rule.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping speaks in advance of the anniversary Credit: KYODO NEWS/Naohiko Hatta - Pool/Getty Images More\n\nAs the unrest has continued, unease has grown over whether Beijing will send in the military to restore order \u2013 a move that would be reminiscent of the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 when soldiers fired on peaceful student demonstrators.\n\nDespite Mr Xi\u2019s remarks that Beijing would remain hands off in dealing with the protests, it emerged Monday that foreign envoys believed China had assembled its largest-ever active force of military troops and other anti-riot personnel in Hong Kong \u2013 estimated at as many as 12,000.\n\nThe addition had been explained away by Beijing in late August as a \u201croutine\u201d rotation of troops.\n\nA build-up of military has also occurred in Shenzhen, a neighbouring Chinese city, with state media releasing videos of troops engaging in anti-riot drills, an ominous warning that soldiers were ready to deploy.\n\nMore of that posturing is coming as Mr Xi will preside over a massive military parade on Tuesday for China\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations, with plans to showcase 15,000 troops, 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of military equipment.\n\nThe parade is expected to include the DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile. Billed as the world\u2019s most powerful, the nuclear-capable missile is thought to be able to reach the US in 30 minutes.\n\nFlower baskets have been presented to deceased national heroes Credit: VCG/VCG via Getty Images More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping stated on Monday that Beijing would continue to allow Hong Kong to handle its own affairs as anti-government protests threaten to tarnish a massive celebration honouring 70 years of Communist rule.", "authors": ["Sophia Yan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QaFv43bhwlGkPmGGjvkeIA--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/56d404adc4e73fc4da7e34f3dc9ebfcb", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
