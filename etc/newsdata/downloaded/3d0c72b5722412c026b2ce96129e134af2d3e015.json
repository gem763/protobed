(The airline also offers a 10kg check-in bag option which you can find out more about on the Ryanair website ).", "description": "Ryanair's new October sale has cheap flights to Europe from \u00a39.99 and there is a generous window of travel dates", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13222388.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ryanair-baggage-rules.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
