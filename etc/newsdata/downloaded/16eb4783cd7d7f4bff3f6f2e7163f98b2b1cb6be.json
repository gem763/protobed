Owen Farrell seems to be finding plenty of it on the pitch, but then, he has never been shy of poking his head down dark alleyways. This time he ran smack into Argentina lock Tom\u00e1s Lavanini, 6ft 7in tall, 20st heavy, and coming up fast and shoulder-first. Lavanini dipped at the waist as he made the final two strides, as if he was offering a cursory bow, and Farrell reacted by dropping down to brace for the collision. Lavanini\u2019s shoulder hit him square on the jaw. By the time Lavanini had finished trying to wrap his arms around Farrell\u2019s back, the England man was already crumpled up on the floor.\n\nEngland dismiss feisty Argentina after Tom\u00e1s Lavanini sees red Read more\n\nEverything changed then. After talking it though with the television match official, Nigel Owens sent Lavanini off and the heat went out of the game as if someone had switched off the gas. The match, which was beginning to boil over, died right down again. It was a tepid next 60 minutes and Farrell was pretty lukewarm. He missed four kicks at goal in the first half. It was the first time he had done that since September 2012, when he missed four out of five playing for Saracens. Three of these misses came after his collision with Lavanini, which could not but make you wonder whether he was still suffering from the effects of the blow.\n\nFarrell was not given a head-injury assessment, but after the game he said he did not have any symptoms of concussion. \u201cI feel fine,\u201d he said. \u201cConcussion is always a worry but I didn\u2019t really get hit anywhere near the top of my head. My jaw\u2019s a bit sore, but there was no need for an HIA.\u201d\n\nHis logic was flawed. You are just as likely to suffer concussion from a blow to the chin as you are to the crown. But Owens, England\u2019s medics, and the independent match doctors all agreed with him that he was fine to play on without any tests.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luke Cowan-Dickie scores a try.

He was smacked by John Quill when England played the USA in Kobe. There have been four straight red cards in this tournament and two of them have been given to players who were trying to knock Farrell\u2019s head off his shoulders.\n\nEngland 39-10 Argentina talking points: a wild big hit and a Billy beef | Paul Rees Read more\n\nThrow in the fifth red card, given to the Samoa winger Ed Fidow for two technical offences against Scotland, and there have been as many sent off in the first two weeks of this World Cup as there were in the four tournaments of 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015.\n\nBut then, it used to be hard a lot harder to get a red card. The last Argentinian who was sent off in a Test against England, Enrique Pieretto, stamped on Joe Marler\u2019s head, and the one before that was F\u00e9derico Mendez, who famously laid out Paul Ackford with a punch to the face at Twickenham.\n\nTimes are changing, though, as everyone knows, and even Argentina\u2019s coach, Mario Ledesma, did not complain about Owens\u2019s decision. \u201cIt had a big impact because it was early in the game,\u201d Ledesma said, \u201cbut I thought it was fair.\u201d\n\nLedesma must know that Lavanini\u2019s something of a liability. He has been given seven cards in international rugby \u2013 five yellow, two red, in 56 Tests \u2013 which makes him one of the worst offenders in the game. He got away with a shoulder charge on the Tonga winger David Halaifonua last week. It was a very different tackle, since it was from side-on while Halaifonua was diving for the line, but it cost Tonga a try that could have turned the match and it went unpunished. Tonga\u2019s coach, Toutai Kefu, will probably not appreciate the poetic justice of Lavanini\u2019s being sent off against England a week later.\n\nFarrell has form himself, being on the other side of these collisions plenty of times. In the short video World Rugby made to teach the players and press about the new high-tackle directives, Farrell\u2019s shoulder charge on Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen during England\u2019s Test against South Africa last November is one of a handful of tackles they used to illustrate what you are not allowed to do.\n\nFarrell escaped without conceding so much as a penalty for that one, which is one reason why he is so unpopular with so many of everyone else\u2019s fans here. They say he always gets away with it.\n\nFarrell says he has worked hard at changing his tackle technique coming into the tournament. But he still seems to be in the thick of it. At the end of this match, after Luke Cowan\u2011Dickie had scored a final try, he was caught up in a fight with three Argentina players underneath their posts.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nHe stayed bickering with them even after the rest of his team had already walked away. It was the second big bust-up of the match, after another pile-on early in the first half when Pablo Matera clobbered Ben Youngs.\n\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t call them fights,\u201d Farrell said, \u201cbut there was a lot of that stuff. It\u2019s not something we want to get caught up in, we just want to look after our players, so that\u2019s what we tried to do.\u201d", "description": "The England captain was once more hit high but once again there was no head-injury assessment", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85eac263950999b47196d67e65bbd2825ad8e81c/178_322_2895_1737/master/2895.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79b160fbb40c2705bb4f8fdcb11051d5", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
