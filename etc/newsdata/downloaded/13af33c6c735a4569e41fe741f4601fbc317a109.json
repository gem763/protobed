The decades since the Loma Prieta quake have been remarkably quiet \u2013 yet it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when, the next large earthquake will rattle the Bay Area, and the consequences will undoubtedly be severe.\n\nThere are multiple faults to worry about in the Bay: the infamous San Andreas is a system, with branches that run up the San Francisco peninsula, along the East Bay foothills through Oakland and Berkeley and further inland through Dublin and Walnut Creek.\n\nJust this week, a 4.5-magnitude quake with an epicenter in the Pleasant Hill area shook the region.\n\nAn antenna to send data stands on a rise above an earthquake monitoring well, right, powered by a solar electric panel, lower left, as scientists from the US Geological Survey set up an earthquake monitoring station on the San Andreas fault.

The California Geological Survey\u2019s most recent map of earthquake hazards shows huge swaths of the inner Bay Area are in \u201cliquefaction zones\u201d, meaning that during a major earthquake, the ground could be shaken so violently that it would very temporarily soften into jelly.\n\n\u201cPeople love to ask the question: is X place prepared for X disaster? Is California prepared for the next earthquake? The answer to that question, 99.99% of the time, is no,\u201d said Dr Samantha Montano, assistant professor of emergency management and disaster science at the University of Nebraska Omaha. \u201cThe way we think about preparedness is really kind of weird. When we talk about it day to day: do you have an emergency kit, yes or no? Just because you have that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re prepared for an earthquake \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more going into that.\u201d\n\nFor any community facing a potential wide-scale disaster, the preparation is twofold: mitigating risk and preparing for the inevitable management of the emergency.\n\nWhile newer, stricter building codes put in place after Loma Prieta have required more quake-resilient construction, thousands of buildings in the Bay Area were built using old, shaky standards. Oakland passed an ordinance in 2019 requiring owners of vulnerable apartments to retrofit their structures. In San Francisco, where retrofits were due to be completed in 2018, about three-quarters of susceptible units have been quake-prepped.\n\nPoliticians in Berkeley cited earthquake risk as one motivator for moving to ban natural gas hook-ups in new buildings earlier this year.\n\nOfficials and others evacuate a man, Erick Carlson, from the Cypress section of Highway 17, now called Interstate 880, in Oakland, California, following the Loma Prieta earthquake.

We can see that this is a dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nThe East Bay had perhaps a little taste of that danger earlier this week: following the mid-sized East Bay quake, two of the area\u2019s five refineries shut down due to the \u201cupset\u201d and their built-up gasses flared.", "description": "The 6.9-magnitude Loma Prieta quake killed 63 in 1989.
