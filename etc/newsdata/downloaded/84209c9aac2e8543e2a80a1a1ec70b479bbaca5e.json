No artists were involved in our decision-making.\u2019\n\nCook, 42, who played a large part of launching Ed Sheeran\u2019s career, was said to have been banned from watching Stormzy perform his historic headline set at Glastonbury from the side of the stage this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn insider told The Sun: \u2018He stepped in and made it clear he would not be prepared to keep working with them if Ben stayed, and also that he might go public with the details of why.\n\n\u2018He clearly saw this as a major issue and felt he had a responsibility to use his influence to highlight it \u2014 and to ensure incidents like this are taken seriously.\n\nCook had worked with the likes of Ed Sheeran and Cardi B (Picture: Atlantic Records, Twitter)\n\nStormzy reportedly refused to allow Cook near the stage at Glastonbury (Picture: WireImage)\n\n\u2018He absolutely believes this was the right thing to do.\u2019\n\nIn a statement announcing he had quit, Cook said he simply wanted to honour one of his musical heroes by dressing up as an unspecified member of Run DMC.\n\n\u2018While my intention was to honour a musical hero, I recognise my appearance was offensive and I made a terrible mistake.\n\n\u2018I am devastated this mistake has caused upset and has called into question my commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion.\n\n\u2018I have learned a great deal from this event and will resolutely continue to champion these values moving forward.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Stormzy for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
