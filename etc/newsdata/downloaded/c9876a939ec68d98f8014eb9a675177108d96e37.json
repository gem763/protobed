It wasn\u2019t clear where his complaint stemmed from, but the tweet with which he apparently aimed to correct the record was itself riddled with errors:\n\nTo show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle\u2019, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff. Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nPolitical pundits, journalists and copy editors pounced on the multiple mistakes, including the president\u2019s appearing to confuse the meanings of hyphen and apostrophe, as well as his misspelling of the word \u201cdescribing\u201d:\n\nThe president is calling out someone else for misspelling a word that doesn\u2019t exist in a tweet in which he uses the word \u201cdiscribing\u201d and calls an apostrophe a hyphen. pic.twitter.com/BxKWXBOuoP \u2014 The Volatile Mermaid (@OhNoSheTwitnt) September 27, 2019\n\nBy hyphen he means apostrophe. And by discribing he means describing. But I\u2019m stuck on the difference between liddle and liddle\u2019. Is liddle\u2019 possessive? As in \u201cself-owned?\u201d https://t.co/jJB5k5Srbb \u2014 Matt Dornic (@mdornic) September 27, 2019\n\nCould someone simply ask @ewarren if she can discern between a hyphen and an apostrophe and let's wrap this up already. \u2014 Benjamin Dreyer (@BCDreyer) September 27, 2019\n\n\"Trump claims the media is dishonest because it claims he spelled the word 'little' wrong when he spelled it 'liddle' but he argues that adding an apostrophe to 'liddle' makes it a correct spelling, though he calls the apostrophe a hyphen\" has a strong bot-generating-tweets vibe. \u2014 Philip Bump (@pbump) September 27, 2019\n\nIt caused several hashtags to trend on Friday morning, including #Liddle, #hyphen and #discribing:\n\nWhen \u201cLiddle,\u201d \u201cDiscribing,\u201d \u201chyphen\u201d & \u201capostrophe\u201d are trending - and you know why without even looking pic.twitter.com/Lbr9Pv4qwS \u2014 TrivWorks (@TrivWorks) September 27, 2019\n\nEven the Merriam-Webster dictionary\u2019s official Twitter account weighed in, helpfully describing the difference between a hyphen and an apostrophe:\n\nFor those looking up punctuation early on a Friday morning:\n\n\n\nA hyphen is a mark - used to divide or to compound words.\n\nAn apostrophe is a mark ' used to indicate the omission of letters or figures. \u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) September 27, 2019\n\nSchiff had paraphrased the released version of Trump\u2019s contested phone call with the Ukrainian president during the whistleblower hearing on Thursday that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Trump and many Republican lawmakers have criticized Schiff for that description of the call, calling it a parody or fictional. The president posted a series of other tweets on Friday morning that claimed Schiff\u2019s version of the call had made \u201cit sound horrible, and me sound guilty.\u201d Trump demanded that Schiff \u201cimmediately resign from Congress\u201d:\n\nRep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for the White House, however. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has raked in millions of dollars in the days immediately following House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement.\n\nRead on: Pelosi expresses alarm at Trump suggestion of retaliation against whistleblower", "description": "Even the Merriam-Webster dictionary weighed in on the president\u2019s post about Adam Schiff.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS212_trump__ZG_20190927093907.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
