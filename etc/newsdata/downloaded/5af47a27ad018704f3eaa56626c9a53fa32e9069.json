Global warming so fully occupies the thinking of some that there\u2019s no room for information that will contradict their faith.\n\nIf they\u2019d only open their minds they\u2019d see:\n\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t warmed since 2005. America isn\u2019t the entire world. But the alarmists gleefully point out regional heatwaves and the \u201chottest day on record\u201d when cities endure summer scorchers. So let\u2019s look at the data. The U.S. Climate Reference Network, \u201ca sophisticated climate-observing network specifically designed and deployed for quantifying climate change on a national scale,\u201d has found there\u2019s been no warming in the U.S. going back to 2005.\n\nIn fact, says meteorologist Anthony Watts, the \u201clittle known data from the state-of-the-art\u201d operation, \u201c(which never seems to make it into NOAA\u2019s monthly \u2018state of the climate\u2019 reports) show that for the past nine months, six of them were below normal.\u201d\n\nThe data also tell us 2019\u2019s average has been cooler than 2005\u2019s, the first year of the data set.\n\nMan\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions are not burning down the Amazon. Empty-headed celebrities and activists have had quite a virtue-signaling feast tweeting photos from fires three decades ago, fires in Europe, and fires in the U.S. Yes, we\u2019ve seen the claims that there are 80% more fires this year than last in South America, but we\u2019ve also seen this from the New York Times:\n\n\u201cThe majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year\u2019s crops and pasture.\u201d\n\nOf course that\u2019s a disposable detail because it doesn\u2019t fit the narrative.\n\nCarbon dioxide increases historically lag temperature increases. \u201cIn 1985, ice cores extracted from Greenland revealed temperatures and CO2 levels going back 150,000 years,\u201d writes author Joanne Nova. \u201cTemperature and CO2 seemed locked together. It was a turning point \u2014 the \u2018greenhouse effect\u2019 captured attention. But, in 1999 it became clear that carbon dioxide rose and fell after temperatures did. By 2003, we had better data showing the lag was 800 \u00b1 200 years. CO2 was in the back seat.\u201d\n\nOf course the climate crusaders have written at great length to tell us it\u2019s all just a myth. This time, they say, the warming (which is in doubt) is caused by man. It just has to be. All those other warming periods, the alarmists tell us, can be explained by natural events, such as Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun, which, incidentally, we have mentioned as one of many factors that influence climate changes.\n\nLess than 5% of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by man. Web searches turn up what seems like an endless list of stories and blog posts reporting that CO2 levels in the atmosphere have reached or exceeded 415 parts per million. This has been almost universally treated as the tip of an imminent disaster, as man has pushed greenhouse gas emissions beyond a dangerous threshold. But has he?\n\nThe United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u201cagrees today\u2019s annual human carbon dioxide emissions are 4.5 ppm (parts per million) per year and nature\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions are 98 ppm per year,\u201d says climate scientist Ed Berry. \u201cYet, the IPCC claims human emissions have caused all the increase in carbon dioxide since 1750, which is 30% of today\u2019s total.\n\n\u201cHow can human carbon dioxide, which is less than 5% of natural carbon dioxide, cause 30% of today\u2019s atmospheric carbon dioxide? It can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t like Berry\u2019s numbers? Consider another set of figures from the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report, which says that of the 750 gigatons of CO2 which travel through the carbon cycle every year, only 29 gigatons, or less than 4%, are produced by man.\n\nIs it possible for such a small portion to have such a great influence? Despite what the hysterics tell us, it\u2019s an unanswered question.\n\nThere are many other unanswered questions about climate, as well. An honest person would admit that they might remain unanswered forever. An alarmist, however, has his mind made up \u2014 and closed down.\n\nIssues & Insights is a new site formed by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
