The S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3%. Global stocks, meanwhile, wavered as concerns lingered over Brexit talks and the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\nData from the Commerce Department Wednesday showed that U.S. retail sales slipped 0.3% in September, missing the expectations of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal who had predicted a 0.2% increase.\n\nThat further fueled anxiety about growth in the U.S. and overseas. The International Monetary Fund this week cut its global GDP forecast for 2019 to just 3%, its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, citing trade tensions and geopolitics. It projected 3.4% growth in 2020.\n\n\"Right now, you're not getting any relief from this trade war,\" said Edward Moya, an analyst at forex brokerage Oanda. \"Until there is something that is signed and something the market believes is achievable, you're not going to see any forecasts have any upgrades.\"\n\nInvestors continue to scrutinize the details of the \"phase one\" trade deal reached between the U.S. and China last week. Despite a Chinese promise to buy more U.S. farm products, questions remain over how much, the time frame for purchases, and what the U.S. might have to give in return. The U.S. still plans to impose new 15% tariffs on $156 billion in consumer goods starting Dec. 15.\n\nThe uncertainty over the trade war, and even central bank policies makes it harder for companies to plan ahead.\n\n\"That could be the transmission channel in which the slowdown intensifies,\" said Ben May, the director of global macro research at Oxford Economics.\n\nDespite those worries, major U.S. stock indexes remain near all-time highs. Investors will look to corporate earnings for new drivers.\n\nBank of America shares rose 2.2% as the bank reported gains in its consumer, wealth and commercial businesses. PNC Financial Services Group, Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bancorp also rose after reporting results.\n\nIBM and Netflix will also report their third-quarter earnings after markets close in the U.S.\n\nIn other corporate news, shares of McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health rallied after The Wall Street Journal reported they were in talks to settle opioid crisis litigation. Shares in McKesson rose 5.4%, AmerisourceBergen rose 4.8%, and Cardinal Health rose 3.4%.\n\nDespite the downbeat report on consumer spending, consumer-related stocks ticked higher. General Motors rose 2% on reports of a tentative deal with its striking union workers. Advance Auto Parts gained 2.4%, and BorgWarner rose 1.7%.\n\nU.S. crude oil added 1.3%, gold gained 0.6%, and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.75% from 1.77% on Tuesday.\n\nOverseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index edged 0.1% lower as talks toward a draft plan for Britain to leave the European Union continued. Investors had been anticipating positive news to emerge overnight but were disappointed by a lack of progress Wednesday, said Peter Dixon, a senior economist at Commerzbank.\n\n\"We were told there would be a deadline of midnight last night; both sides sounded very positive. Then we woke up and it was still a work in progress and I think that has changed investors' perceptions of where we are,\" he said.\n\nEven if a deal is reached, questions remained about whether the British Parliament will back it, others cautioned.\n\n\"It does look like there is progress but there are hurdles to get something agreed with the EU and then it will be difficult to get it through Parliament,\" said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Investments.\n\nThe British pound, which had hit a four-month high against the U.S. dollar a day earlier, rose 0.5%, while the FTSE 100 gauge for U.K. equities slipped 0.6%.\n\nChinese stocks edged lower on concerns that tensions with the U.S. over the Hong Kong protests would make striking a trade deal more complicated.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4% after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a series of bills backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, drawing a strong rebuke from China. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman warned the U.S. against meddling in Chinese affairs and said the bill would damage relations between the two nations.\n\nThe development may complicate efforts to reach a trade agreement, analysts said.\n\n\"We got sideswiped by those headlines from China,\" said Stephen Innes, a market strategist for currency broker AxiTrader in Bangkok. \"I'm not sure much is going to actually come from it, but it's just another thing to deal with.\"\n\nWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 16, 2019 12:36 ET (16:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
