You\u2019ve survived the application process, endured the interview component, bribed your references into saying nice things about your questionable punctuality and somehow managed to receive an offer that includes paid sick leave (great news for your hangovers).\n\nBut before you burn all your bridges at your current job by throwing down a passive aggressive resignation letter, there\u2019s one more occupational hurdle left to jump \u2013 signing the new contract.\n\nChucking your John Hancock on an employment contract is a pretty serious business. This one innocuous piece of paper legally determines everything from your working hours to your termination package (god forbid), so you\u2019d be a silly billy if you didn\u2019t give it a good once over.\n\nThat said, we don\u2019t all speak lawyer. In fact, I dropped out of Year 11 Legal Studies and took up Religion instead. Which was, admittedly, an even more questionable choice of VCE subject, but that\u2019s a story for another day. So what\u2019s a gal (or guy) to look for in a written contract?\n\n\n\nCheck your notice period\n\nThis is a big one, and it can differ depending on the employer and the contract. If it\u2019s too long, you might feel stuck and unable to eventually move onto a new role but if it\u2019s too short then you could end up at a loss in between jobs. Check your notice period before you do a runner.\n\nAlways talk salary\n\nYes, money is awkward. But you know what\u2019s more awkward? Selling yourself short, getting underpaid and borrowing moolah off your parents. Now is the best time to talk money, so just suck it up and name your price.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to triple check that the remuneration value on your contract is the same as what was in your offer letter (if you got one) and definitely always ask about other benefits like private health cover, share options, what superannuation you will be paid (some employers pay above the minimum rate), whether the superannuation is already included in your remuneration or will be added on top, bonuses and commission payments. ESPECIALLY if yours is a role based on performance, like sales.\n\nDiscuss your superannuation\n\nSuperannuation is important. Like, heaps important. No one wants to be on a Mi Goreng retirement budget, after all. Your new job is going to ask you for your superannuation details and now is the perfect time to rethink your super strategy. If you have multiple super accounts and your super is a hot mess, for the love of money \u2013 consider whether consolidation is right for you! There are a bunch of options out there that might work for you.\n\nBefore you do that? Take a sec to consider where future employer contributions will be paid, the other fees you may incur with the rollover, and losing your current insurance benefits from your existing provider(s) when the insurance is cancelled. It could make your life a lot easier in the long run.\n\nRead the fine print\n\nDepending on what industry you\u2019re entering there may be such a thing as \u2018restrictive covenants\u2019 included in your contract, AKA big important rules that prevent you from, say, poaching all the good clients or working for a competitor. You\u2019ll definitely want to familiarise yourself with this section of the contract so that you don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot when/if you leave the office.\n\nTalk holidays\n\nImagine this \u2013 you\u2019ve been amassing your annual leave. You\u2019ve worked every public holiday. You\u2019ve not taken time off in 365 days. You submit your leave request, anticipating a white Christmas a la Love Actually, only for it to be rejected by HR because \u201cemployees are not able to take leave over the Christmas period\u201d. To avoid disappointment, double check any limitations annual leave times (and the availability of Hugh Grant).\n\nAgree on the job title and duties\n\nThis might seem obvious but there is nothing worse than starting a new role only to find out that you\u2019ve accidentally agreed to manage a team of 25 colleagues. Or worse, you\u2019re being managed. Be super vigilant that the contract details your responsibilities and make sure you\u2019re 100 per cent comfortable with everything the position entails. If not, speak up. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nREAD MORE You Can Buy This Haunted Doll On EBay For $5,600 If You Really Want To Fuck Your Life Up\n\nThis article was sponsored by ING (ING Bank (Australia) Limited ABN 24 000 893 292, Australian Financial Service Licence 229823) and written by PEDESTRIAN.TV.
