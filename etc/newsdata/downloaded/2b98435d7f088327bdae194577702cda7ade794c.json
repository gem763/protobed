(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nTOLEDO, Ohio (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump once promised that coal and steel would be the beating heart of a revived U.S. economy \u2014 a nostalgic vision that helped carry him to victory three years ago in the industrial Midwest.\n\nBut a year away from Election Day, that promised renaissance is not materializing and both sectors are faltering in ways that are painfully familiar and politically significant.\n\nRecent data show manufacturing jobs are disappearing across Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, all states critical to Trump's reelection chances. On Tuesday, Murray Energy, a major mining firm with close ties to the president, became the latest of many coal companies to file for bankruptcy this year, rattling communities across Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky. The news followed recent layoffs at a prominent steel manufacturer in northeastern Ohio and General Motors' final decision this fall to shutter its massive plant at Lordstown, Ohio.\n\nThe turmoil in the manufacturing and mining sectors threatens to undermine Trump's claim to a booming economy \u2014 the bedrock of his and his Republican allies' campaign strategy \u2014 in places where it matters most. While Trump's economy is benefiting high-tech manufacturing and energy sectors in other regions, the manufacturing slump across the Rust Belt may test whether Trump can retain his appeal to blue-collar workers without having fully delivered on his promise to fatten their bank accounts.\n\n\"I don't think that Ohio is just a lock in the Republican's column, nor do I think that blue-collar voters are settled on who they're likely to select,\" said Robert Alexander, a political scientist at Ohio Northern University. \"There is a lot of economic angst still in the state.\"\n\nRecent elections haven't shown that angst to be aimed at Republicans. After Trump won Ohio by 12 percentage points \u2014 the largest margin of any presidential candidate since 1988 \u2014 Republicans fared better in Ohio than in many other states in last year's midterms, nabbing every statewide office but one. Their winning formula was based overwhelming support from working-class, white voters in small communities where a single company can anchor the local economy.\n\nMurray Energy is based in St. Clairsville, Ohio, a small city near the West Virginia and Pennsylvania borders in a county that voted for Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton by a margin of 40 percentage points. But the company's footprint is far larger, including 17 mines across Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Utah and West Virginia, as well as Colombia, South America.\n\nThe company's former CEO Bob Murray is a Trump donor and advocate for his company's interests. Murray openly pressured Trump to issue an emergency order that would have exempted his struggling company from environmental regulations he said were burdensome. Trump flirted with that idea but never approved it.\n\nMurray said Tuesday the company was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a restructuring that puts at risk the incomes, pensions and health care benefits of roughly 7,000 workers.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy expert, seized on the news as evidence of Trump failing his voters.\n\n\"He made promises to working people all across this country that he would be there on their behalf. Instead he's been there for the lobbyists, he's been there for the giant corporations, he's been there to help make the rich richer and leave everyone else behind,\" she said.\n\nTrump bounded into office promising to bring back \"beautiful clean coal\" and deliver a victory for every factory worker. The message helped him pull out victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio, where scars from the Great Recession that technically ended in 2009 were still fresh.\n\nFor the first two years of his presidency, Trump oversaw an economic recovery that extended across sectors and regions \u2014 adding manufacturing and factory jobs in the Rust Belt and beyond.\n\nBut recent signs show that trajectory shifting downward quickly, fueled by a slumping global economy and the trade wars escalated by the Trump administration.\n\nSo far this year, Ohio has shed 2,400 factory jobs. Michigan has lost 6,200. Pennsylvania has 9,100 fewer manufacturing workers. West Virginia employers have cut 400 mining jobs. And Kentucky has let go of 600 mine workers.", "description": "", "authors": ["Josh Boak", "John Seewer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EwSLKRvgPaIPWmo.HUFH5A--~B/aD0yODA4O3c9NDIxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/dd3452ea38edf45bee85f6aed8e09389", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
