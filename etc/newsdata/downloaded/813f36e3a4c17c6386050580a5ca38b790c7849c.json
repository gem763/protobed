She was the first doctor in over half a century to head the organization. Wen\u2019s departure highlights mounting disagreements within the pro-abortion movement about how to frame the abortion debate that has raged for decades in America.\n\nIn a tweet, Wen stated that the board ended her employment due to \"philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood.\" She elaborated further in a message to her former colleagues. She had joined Planned Parenthood \u201cto run a national health care organization and to advocate for the broad range of public health policies that affect our patients\u2019 health,\u201d including abortion. However, she wrote, for the board, \"the priority of Planned Parenthood moving forward is to double down on abortion rights advocacy.\"\n\nOther media reports indicate that Wen\u2019s management style and \"refusal to use \u2018trans-inclusive\u2019 language\" also contributed to growing tension surrounding her leadership.\n\nTo be clear, Dr. Wen is no \u201cmoderate\u201d when it comes to abortion. There is precisely nothing moderate about her support for abortion for any reason at any time during pregnancy (a view shared by only a small minority of Americans).\n\nBut Wen maintains that \"the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one.\" Many pro-abortion activists (and, evidently, the Planned Parenthood board) disagree. They believe that the focus should be political.\n\nOn Twitter, Princeton University\u2019s McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence, Robert P. George (a board member of my employer, The Heritage Foundation), explained the diverging schools of thought, writing, \"Should abortion be sold as 'health care' \u2014 making it fundamentally a \"medical issue\"? (That seems to have been Wen's strategy.) Or should it be sold as personal autonomy/lifestyle choice, etc.? (Wen apparently thought that made it a 'political issue.')\"\n\nHe added, \"Wen apparently wanted to revive the approach of Justice Harry Blackmun (the hapless author of Roe v. Wade) ... Blackmun had framed abortion as a matter \"between a woman and her doctor.\"\n\nSo what does this all mean for the face of America\u2019s abortion industry going forward?\n\nPlanned Parenthood has appointed an acting president, \u201crenowned social justice leader\u201d and \u201clifelong political organizer\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, and will begin its search for a new president in early 2020.\n\nJohnson has previously served as a board member of Planned Parenthood, and her history of political organizing compared to Wen\u2019s experience as a practicing doctor affirms that the organization will prioritize advocacy and political activity (such as Planned Parenthood\u2019s support for taxpayer funded abortions, a deeply unpopular proposal among the American people regardless of political affiliation).\n\nThe fact that Planned Parenthood receives over half a billion taxpayer dollars annually has long been a point of contention in the United States. The group doggedly insists that abortion is merely a small portion of the many services it provides (a falsehood widely parroted by the mainstream media despite clear evidence to the contrary).\n\nThis week\u2019s upheaval should serve as an unequivocal clarifying moment for policymakers. Planned Parenthood has demonstrated, in no uncertain terms, that abortion procedures and advocacy \u2014 not a wide range of health services \u2014 is the organization\u2019s core mission.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is well within its rights to pursue a certain mission and be guided by a leader who shares that vision. But American taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be forced to underwrite an organization that is singularly focused on, in Wen\u2019s words, \u201cabortion rights advocacy.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s drop the pretense that Planned Parenthood is strapped for cash. The organization\u2019s most recent annual report reveals that it enjoys:\n\nAlmost $1.9 billion in net assets, up from $1.6 billion the previous year.\n\n$563.8 million in taxpayer funding, up from $543.7 million the previous year.\n\n$1.67 billion in total revenue, up from $1.46 billion the previous year.\n\nAlmost $245 million in excess of revenue over expenses, more than double the $98.5 million reported the previous year.\n\n$630.8 million in private contributions (including grants, individual contributors, bequests, and corporate contributors), up from $532.7 million the previous year.\n\nHow committed is Planned Parenthood to abortion? So committed that it is forgoing millions of public funds from the federal Title X family planning program, which serves low-income Americans, because the Trump administration is requiring funding recipients to physically and financially separate Title X and abortion activities. But, then again, with a $245 million annual profit, apparently the group can afford to turn down millions.\n\nGiven Planned Parenthood\u2019s unambiguous priorities, it\u2019s time to pull the plug on all of the organization\u2019s taxpayer funding. Congress should not be financing an organization that prioritizes abortion advocacy over health care services. Taxpayer dollars should instead be distributed to health centers that offer comprehensive health care without entanglement with abortion on demand.", "description": "After less than a year at the helm of\u00a0Planned Parenthood Federation for America, President Leana Wen has been abruptly ousted by the organization\u2019s board of directors.
