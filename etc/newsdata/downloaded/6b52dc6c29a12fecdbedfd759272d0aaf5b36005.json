It seemed to only help the Russian as he overcame his litany of injuries once again to defeat Stan Wawrinka 7-6 (6), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 to reach the semi-finals of the US Open.\n\nThe crowd\u2019s theatrical jeering and Medvedev\u2019s snarky retorts have made a popular duo in New York, but often ignored is the reason that he has craved their energy in the first place: he has ground through 20 wins in 22 matches across five weeks, including winning his first Masters 1000 title in Cincinnati.\n\nIt\u2019s 2019. Tennis doesn\u2019t need a bad boy Read more\n\nThe effort has shown. Throughout this week, the fifth seed has taken to the court with lines of tape strewn across his body. Both adductors are sore, his right shoulder is painful. He admitted that he had taken as many painkillers as possible.\n\nAlthough Medvedev broke in the opening game, it quickly became clear that his body was broken. Moving uncomfortably around the court, he took a medical time out at 4-3 to heavily wrap his left quadriceps and he also took a painkiller. He was hobbling as he lost his serve while serving for the set at 5-4.\n\nThe 23-year-old has become known for his ability to wear down his opponents\u2019 spirit and bodies in long, drawn-out rallies but injury brought on the absurd.\n\nUnable to grind, he began to shorten points, taking the ball early and chasing the net at the first opportunity. Nobody was more confused than Wawrinka, whose pre-match plans were laid to waste.\n\nMedvedev took the first set but not before Wawrinka badly sprayed a forehand wide on his own set point at 6-5 in the tie-break. Early in the second set, another loose forehand error from the Swiss led to the break for 3-1 as Medvedev held throughout.\n\nJohanna Konta teases Elina Svitolina but errors end US Open dream Read more\n\nWawrinka \u2013 who won this championship three years ago by defeating Novak Djokovic in the final \u2013 finally settled and won the third set, but it was too late. By the fourth set, the painkiller was working and Medvedev could revert to his trusted style, digging a trench far behind the baseline and grinding through two breaks to victory.\n\nA year ago, Medvedev arrived in the north American hardcourt summer ranked 68, a non-entity. By reaching his first grand slam semi-final, he will be ranked fourth in the world behind Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.\n\nIn the end, the boos and jeers have been the soundtrack to the rise of a winner.", "description": "Daniil Medvedev reached his first grand slam semi-final by beating Stan Wawrinka 7-6 (6), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 to a chorus of boos from the vociferous crowd", "authors": ["Tumaini Carayol"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78f054362e15f04dbe1fb786b2f4087e04d93e58/0_135_4987_2993/master/4987.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=329ed278fa0bad484a22072e31f2776f"}
