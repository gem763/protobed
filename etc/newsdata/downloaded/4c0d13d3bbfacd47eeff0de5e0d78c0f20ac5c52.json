Scores of ISIS fighters remain under uncertain conditions in Syrian prisons, and countless others in the region and around the world remain intent on spreading their influence and committing acts of terror,\u201d said Mrs. Pelosi.\n\nSimilar to comments by Democratic presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, she said Mr. Trump\u2019s military policy in Syria had made ISIS potentially stronger.\n\nMr. Trump was harshly criticized from both sides of the aisle this month when he pulled out U.S. troops from the Turkey-Syria border, which allowed a Turkish military advance on U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the region.\n\n\u201cThis month, the House passed a joint resolution on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 354-60 basis which rejects President Trump\u2019s green-lighting of Turkish aggression into Syria against our Kurdish partners, and calls on him to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS,\u201d said Mrs. Pelosi.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
