She was 75.\n\nABC broke into network programming to announce her death and pay tribute.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRoberts was the daughter of Hale Boggs, a former House majority leader from Louisiana, and Lindy Boggs, who succeeded her husband in Congress. Roberts worked in local news and CBS News before joining NPR to cover Congress in 1978. She joined ABC a decade later, not leaving NPR.\n\nShe co-anchored the Sunday political show \u201cThis Week\u201d with Sam Donaldson from 1996 to 2002.\n\n\u201cCokie Roberts was a trailblazer who forever transformed the role of women in the newsroom and in our history books,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. \u201cOver five decades of celebrated journalism, Cokie shone a powerful light on the unsung women who built our nation, but whose stories had long gone untold.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Roberts was a role model for women at a time the journalism profession was still dominated by men, and was a constant over 40 years of a shifting media landscape and changing world.\n\n\u201cShe will be missed, and we send our condolences to her family,\u201d Obama said.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, called Roberts a talented, tough and fair reporter.\n\n\u201cWe respected her drive and appreciated her humor,\u201d the former president said. \u201cShe became a friend.\u201d\n\nRoberts, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, kept working nearly to the end. She appeared on \u201cThis Week\u201d in August, drawing enough concern about her evident weight loss that she released a statement saying \u201cI am doing fine\u201d and was looking forward to covering next year\u2019s election.\n\nShe co-wrote a political column for many years with her husband of 53 years, Steven, who survives. They had two children.\n\nRoberts wrote books, focusing on the role of women in history. She wrote two with her husband, one about interfaith families and \u201cFrom This Day Forward,\u201d an account of their marriage.\n\nCurrent ABC News political reporter Jonathan Karl recalled being in awe of Roberts when he first started working at the network.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of politics, I think of Cokie Roberts,\u201d he said.\n\nHer colleagues said she never became cynical or lost her love for politics. She did force NPR to clarify her role as a commentator when she wrote a column in 2016 calling on \u201cthe rational wing\u201d of the Republican party to reject Donald Trump as their presidential candidate.", "description": "Roberts worked in local news and CBS News before joining NPR to cover Congress in 1978.
