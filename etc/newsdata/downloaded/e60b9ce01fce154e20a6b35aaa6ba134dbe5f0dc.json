(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nDiscussion of American cultural conflicts has to take place alongside pivotal conversations about race, not instead of them.\n\nYesterday I spent some time listening to a Vox podcast with Ezra Klein, Jane Coaston, and Dylan Matthews. The subject was the \u201cGreat Twitter Wars of 2018,\u201d and I was particularly interested because they spent some time discussing a piece I wrote last week on Sarah Jeong\u2019s anti-white tweets and the existence of anti-white racism more broadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation was an interesting, thoughtful window into progressive ideas about race, culture, and politics. I highly recommend giving it a listen. There was one segment, however, that stood out to me more than the others: the discussion of what \u201cwhiteness\u201d truly is. Yes, there was the longstanding presumption that \u201cwhite\u201d is the \u201cnorm\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d American race, but there was also a deeper question of the nature of white culture. What is it, exactly?\n\nAt that point, Klein brought up the old blog Stuff White People Like. I remember it well. As a son of the rural South who spent some time living in prosperous quarters of progressive America \u2014 Manhattan, Cambridge, Ma., Philadelphia\u2019s Center City \u2014 I thought it was funny. It satirized a highly specific kind of white American life, one largely alien to my existence. The \u201cwhite people\u201d in that blog were nothing like the white people I grew up with.\n\nAnd that brings me to the subject that I think has to be discussed right alongside race when discussing American life and American politics: the great white culture war.\n\nConservative white Americans eagerly move to majority-minority Texas. Those same people would be far more reluctant to live in majority-minority California, because of its profoundly different treatment of religious freedoms, gun rights, and of course tax rates.\n\nWith each passing year, I grow more convinced that Charles Murray\u2019s Coming Apart and J.D. Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy represent two of the best vehicles for understanding our times. Though they\u2019re not specifically political, they help us understand the profound differences between different white American communities \u2014 differences that are often exacerbated in our polarized age.\n\nConsider, for example, the extraordinary faith gap between white Republicans and white Democrats. According to recent Pew data, fully 72 percent of white Republicans believe in the God of the Bible. Only 32 percent of white Democrats share that same faith. To take another important cultural issue, gun-ownership rates vary wildly between white Americans, with whites in blue America far less likely to have a firearm at home.\n\nNow, what does this have to do with race and condemnations of \u201cwhiteness\u201d? Earlier this week, my colleague Reihan Salam wrote a fascinating piece in The Atlantic making the point that white-bashing is actually a way in which the progressive white elite distinguishes itself from \u201clower\u201d white rivals, a form of \u201cintra-white status jockeying.\u201d Here\u2019s Reihan:\n\nIt is almost as though we\u2019re living through a strange sort of ethnogenesis, in which those who see themselves as (for lack of a better term) upper-whites are doing everything they can to disaffiliate themselves from those they\u2019ve deemed lower-whites. Note that to be \u201cupper\u201d or \u201clower\u201d isn\u2019t just about class status, though of course that\u2019s always hovering in the background. Rather, it is about the supposed nobility that flows from racial self-flagellation.\n\nGiven the awesome power these \u201cupper-whites\u201d exercise in elite American institutions, there are incentives for other people to bash whites as well:\n\nIn some instances, white-bashing can actually serve as a means of ascent, especially for Asian Americans. Embracing the culture of upper-white self-flagellation can spur avowedly enlightened whites to eagerly cheer on their Asian American comrades who show (abstract, faceless, numberless) lower-white people what for. And, simultaneously, it allows Asian Americans who use the discourse to position themselves as ethnic outsiders, including those who are comfortably enmeshed in elite circles.\n\nReihan is onto something very important. And it helps explain why the GOP\u2019s revulsion at the message that white people\u2019s day is done isn\u2019t grounded exclusively (or even mostly) in racial resentment and fear. Because we know full-well that the white people who so gleefully make that claim fully expect to emerge victorious, their status and power intact, in a post-white-majority America.\n\nTo understand different outcomes of the white culture war, consider California and Texas. Both states are firmly majority-minority. Yet the leaders of both states are still disproportionately white and male; they\u2019re just culturally very different kinds of white males. Conservative white Americans eagerly move to majority-minority Texas. Those same people would be far more reluctant to live in majority-minority California, because of its profoundly different treatment of religious freedoms, gun rights, and of course tax rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not mean to imply that white progressives who cheer the rise of minority Americans and lament the prevalence of white supremacy are anything but sincere in their abhorrence of racism or their desire for black and brown Americans to achieve and succeed in the United States. I count too many progressives as close friends to think that they don\u2019t truly wish for racial reconciliation and justice. Many, many conservatives share the same longing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at the same time, the liberal desire for racial justice is embedded within a larger world view that is antithetical on other grounds to white conservatives, and embedded within manners, mores, and habits of life that are substantially different from the manners, mores, and habits of life of more rural and exurban America. Urban America and heartland #Murica are two very, very different places.\n\nThus, conservative white Americans look at urban multicultural liberalism and notice an important fact: Its white elite remains, and continues to enjoy staggering amounts of power and privilege. So when that same white elite applauds the decline of \u201cwhite America,\u201d what conservatives often hear isn\u2019t a cheer for racial justice but another salvo in our ongoing cultural grudge match, with the victors seeking to elevate black and brown voices while remaining on top themselves.\n\nEven worse, each side of the white cultural divide all too often conditions its embrace of minorities on their embrace of (or at least acquiescence in) other key positions in the great white culture war. Are current battles over religious liberty central to racial justice? Are abortion rights pivotal to racial equality? Those questions are hard to answer, at best, but both are becoming litmus tests for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll say it again: Discussion of American cultural conflicts has to take place alongside, not instead of, pivotal conversations and debates about race. Indeed, the legacy of American racism (including the sad prevalence of outright racists in the GOP) is one reason why white conservatives struggle to form alliances with black voters who are actually more culturally and religiously similar to their rural and exurban white neighbors than to their white progressive allies.\n\nThis is but one short piece. Other pieces can be written about the role race undeniably plays in our politics and culture. But it\u2019s important to understand that when conservatives confront a political coalition that seems to be cheering the decline of \u201cwhiteness,\u201d they often experience it as an attack on \u201cwhite people the Left doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nAs for the rest? They roll on, enjoying the same power and the same privilege. They\u2019ve sacrificed little and stand to gain a lot: nothing short of victory in the great white culture war.", "description": "Discussion of American cultural conflicts has to take place alongside pivotal conversations about race, not instead of them.", "authors": ["David French", "Andrew C.
