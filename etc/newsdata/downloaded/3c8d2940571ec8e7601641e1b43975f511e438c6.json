(June 18) AP\n\nTime in front of screens \u2013 TV, video games, smartphones \u2013 hurts kids' performance at school, right?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nSome screen time is worse than others when it comes to kids and academic performance, according to a new analysis published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nTelevision viewing, followed by video games, were the two activities most tied to poor school performance, researchers showed in a review of 58 studies published over the decades.\n\nThat kind of screen time affected both children and teens \u2013 though overall, teens' performance seemed to suffer the most as screen time increased.\n\nOther screen time, like playing on phones or surfing the internet, didn't yield any clear indication that they were wrecking kids' achievement.\n\nWhen screen time goes wrong: How to handle your children's smartphone, tablet and video game addictions\n\nThat means parents should set limits for individual activities, especially TV and video games.\n\n\"It's increasingly clear that it may be time to move past 'screen time' as a useful term,\" said Michael Robb, senior director of research for Common Sense, a nonprofit that makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families and schools.\n\nStill no screen time for babies: Stop putting your littles in front of screens, WHO advises\n\nScreen time \"doesn't capture the many different ways that different kids use media and affect them in different ways,\" Robb said. \"We should be doing more to look at what screen time is comprised of \u2013 what shows kids are watching, what games they're playing, what they're doing online \u2013 and how media and tech are being used.\"\n\nResearchers across the country are trying to figure out whether a digitally addicted culture, particularly among kids, spells trouble for the future.\n\nThere's no doubt about screen addiction. Pew Research Center found last year that 95% of teenagers have a smartphone or access to one, and 45% say they are near-constantly online. In fact, many are digitally tethered nearly around the clock.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 children keep their mobile phones within reach of their bed, according to a survey published in May by Common Sense. They are twice as likely as their parents to have their phone actually in bed with them. Girls outpaced boys 33%- 26%.\n\nThis new analysis is important because it separates out the screens most closely associated with leisure time \u2013 TV and video games \u2013 as opposed to those that can be used in conjunction with schoolwork, said Victor Fornari, vice chairman of the Child & Adolescent Psychiatry department at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, New York.\n\nStill want to keep your existing limit? That's still good for your kids, another study showed\n\n\"We are raising a population of overweight and obese youth,\" Fornani told USA TODAY. He said the bottom-line result of the study is about keeping an eye on your kids.\n\n\"Parents always have to monitor kids and how much game playing they have,\" Fornari said. \"Parents have to do more. They have to be very involved with what kids are doing on their screen time.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/10/06/screen-time-kids-limit-how-much-tv-video-games-phone/3781282002/", "description": "Time in front of screens hurts kids' performance at school, right?
