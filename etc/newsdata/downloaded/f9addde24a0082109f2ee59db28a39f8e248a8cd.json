MMNFF, +4.24% announced Tuesday the termination of the deal to buy PharmaCann LLC, with the cannabis company saying it has determined that focusing on leveraging its retail brand and on its California business can create more shareholder value than completing the acquisition. MedMen had announced a year ago a letter of intent to buy PharmaCann in a stock deal valued at $682 million. \"The cannabis sector has evolved tremendously since we first announced the PharmaCann transaction and based on the current macro-environment and future opportunities that exist for our business, we believe it is now in the best interest of our shareholders to deepen, rather than widen, our company's reach,\" said MedMen Chief Executive Adam Bierman. As part of the termination agreement, PharmaCann has agreed to pay a termination fee to MedMen through a transfer of membership interests in three entities holding assets in Illinois and Virginia. Separately, MedMen said Chief Financial Officer Michael Kramer was terminated on Oct. 7, and will be succeeded by Zeeshan Hyder, who was the company's chief corporate development officer. MedMen's stock has tumbled 39% year to date through Monday, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, -2.35% has shed 18% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.45% has gained 17%.", "description": "MedMen Enterprises Inc. announced Tuesday the termination of the deal to buy PharmaCann LLC, with the cannabis company saying it has determined that focusing...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
