But last week, daily complaints on social media included more than \u00a3200 ordered from East London takeaways from one account and another fraudulent order for \u00a3100 worth of cigarettes from the local Co-op.\n\nFraudsters often order small amounts, even single meals, at a time. One customer said her account had been used to order \u2018posh chocolate\u2019.\n\nJason Hill, lead cyber security researcher at CyberInt, said email addresses, passwords and bank details are stolen through data breaches at other companies and traded on the Dark Web, part of the internet not visible to search engines.\n\nFast food deliveries fuel obesity Half a million families with school-age children indulge in calorie-laden, home delivered fast food at least once a week. Those with children in primary school are the most likely to do so \u2013 with almost one in ten families getting takeaways via such apps such as Just Eat, Deliveroo and UberEats at least weekly. Parents of secondary school children are not far behind, at seven per cent. Both groups are above the average for the adult population of six per cent. Overall, the numbers using delivery services at least once a week has jumped from 2.3 million in 2015 to 3 million in 2019. Professor Naveed Sattar, of Glasgow University, said the growth of fast-food delivery was \u2018highly likely to be fuelling obesity\u2019. The figures come days after England\u2019s outgoing Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, called for a ban on eating on public transport to reduce childhood obesity.

Unfortunately, cyber criminals rely on people reusing the same passwords on multiple online services and use data breaches elsewhere to try to gain access to other accounts online.\u2019", "description": "Daily complaints on social media included more than \u00a3200 ordered from East London takeaways from one account and another fraudulent order for \u00a3100 worth of cigarettes from the local Co-op.", "authors": ["Neil Craven Deputy City Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/20/19633148-0-image-a-12_1570910156476.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
