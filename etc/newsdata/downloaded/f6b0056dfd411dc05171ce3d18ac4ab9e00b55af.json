Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman.\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the presentation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it in advance, Bustos presented the results from multiple focus groups held across the country since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) officially launched the impeachment inquiry in September.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe main takeaway of those focus groups, the people said, is that Democrats need to be mindful that they are not seen as rushing to convict Trump and must undertake a robust fact-finding process to lay the groundwork.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that when the time comes, the House has to make a clear, convincing case\u201d to the American people for Trump\u2019s removal, one person said.\n\nBustos also presented new polling numbers on health care indicating that Americans continue to trust Democrats over Republicans in handling the issue, but they are eager for action on controlling prescription drug costs \u2014 findings that could give Democrats an incentive as they prepare their sweeping drug costs bill, known as H.R. 3, for the House floor.\n\nAD\n\nPelosi also attended and briefed Democrats on the resolution authorizing new impeachment procedures expected to come up for a House vote on Thursday. The text of the resolution is scheduled to be released Tuesday afternoon, multiple aides said.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n9:15 a.m.: Vindman arrives at the Capitol for deposition\n\nVindman has arrived at the Capitol for his scheduled deposition with House investigators. He came wearing his military uniform with a Capitol Police escort and entered through the South Door, declining to answer questions shouted by reporters.\n\nMinutes before Vindman\u2019s arrival, Trump was back on Twitter, asking, \u201cWas he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nAD\n\n9 a.m.: George Conway to Trump's defenders: 'Just stop'\n\nConservative lawyer George Conway, a leading \"Never Trumper,\" whose Twitter feed has become a platform to condemn Trump, wrote Tuesday morning that Trump's public defenders should stop lying for the president or risk going down in disgrace with him.\n\nAD\n\n\"To the members of Congress, public officials and talking heads still defending @realDonaldTrump: Just stop. Especially the lying. He has no defense. Don't go down with him in history in disgrace. The sooner we get this over with and he's gone, the better off everyone will be,\" Conway wrote on Twitter.\n\nConway, of course, is famously married to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who is among the most high-profile of Trump's advocates.\n\nAD\n\n8:50 a.m.: Trump says Democrats are trying to distract from his accomplishments\n\nTrump returned to Twitter again Tuesday morning to argue that Democrats are trying to distract from his accomplishments in office.\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever, the monumental weekend raid, Tax Cuts, the Rebuilding of our Military, etc.,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump also renewed complaints that the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry has not testified before Congress and argued that the transcript of his July call with the leader of Ukraine shows he did nothing inappropriate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript, everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nIn another tweet, Trump suggested that Vindman is a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n8:20 a.m.: Clark says Vindman will offer \u2018very important testimony\u2019\n\nRep. Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.), vice chair of the Democratic caucus, said that she expects Vindman to provide \u201cfirsthand evidence of the betrayal of this president of his oath of office, of the integrity of the 2020 elections and of our national security.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is part of the patriots who are coming forward at great risk to them and their careers to share the truth with the American people,\u201d Clark said Tuesday during a CNN interview in which she called Vindman\u2019s deposition \u201cvery important testimony.\u201d\n\nClark also spoke out against Fox News hosts and guests and some Republicans who have tried to make an issue of Vindman\u2019s family fleeing Ukraine as a child, suggesting he has an affinity for the country.\n\nClark said they are \u201ctrying to assassinate the character of a Purple Heart winner.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe said such talk was coming from \u201cRepublicans who have no excuse for the conduct of the president and who see mounting evidence of truly a betrayal of our democracy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n7:45 a.m.: Trump complains of witnesses he doesn\u2019t know\n\nAhead of Vindman\u2019s planned testimony on Tuesday, Trump went on Twitter to complain about testimony from \u201cpeople that I never even heard of.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call,\u201d he said in a tweet in which he argued the transcript of his call with Zelensky proved there was no wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cJust READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\n7:40 a.m.: Jordan says lawmakers need to know \u2018how this whole thing started\u2019\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking GOP member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and a staunch Trump ally, said Tuesday that lawmakers should focus on the origins of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe one thing is clear is this is all based on one anonymous whistleblower, and there are 435 members of Congress, and only one member, only one member knows who that whistleblower is \u2026 and that individual is Adam Schiff,\u201d Jordan said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cHow is that fair that only Adam Schiff knows how this whole thing started?\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThis is something that we need to get to the bottom of and know how this whole thing started.\u201d\n\nJordan also argued that there could not be a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d because the Ukrainians took no public actions to free up the military aid that was being withheld at the time Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainians did nothing to get the aid turned back on,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cPresident Zelensky didn\u2019t do a statement saying he was going to do certain things. They didn\u2019t start investigations to get the aid turned back on. The aid was turned back on, I think, because United States senators were telling the president, let\u2019s turn this aid back on and let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\n7 a.m. Rep. Collins suggests unfair process will lead to tainted results\n\nRep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the ranking GOP member of the House Judiciary Committee, suggested Tuesday that facts unearthed during the impeachment inquiry will be tainted because the process is unfair to Trump.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t trust Adam Schiff to find the facts when he can\u2019t even deliver basic fairness,\u201d Collins said in a tweet.\n\nIn his tweet, Collins attached a piece by Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn in which he accused Democrats of \u201ctrampling on impeachment norms.\u201d McGurn noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had introduced a resolution last week condemning the House process that now has 50 co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cEven Republicans who don\u2019t like the president can unite on this,\u201d McGurn wrote. \u201cDemocrats counter that Republicans are complaining about process because they can\u2019t address the substance. But process is how you get to substance.\u201d\n\nIn a separate tweet Monday, Collins weighed in on the decision by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to hold a vote this week on the rules of the inquiry going forward.\n\n\u201cThank you, @SpeakerPelosi, for finally acknowledging the fact that you attempted to deceive the American people into thinking you were conducting a fair impeachment inquiry,\u201d Collins wrote. \u201cJust one problem: It\u2019s impossible to undo 35 days of @RepAdamSchiff\u2018s secrecy, leaks, and innuendo.\u201d\n\n6:45 a.m.: White House official to tell impeachment investigators he feared Trump\u2019s demands of Ukraine would undermine national security\n\nAn Army officer assigned to the White House plans to tell House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that he was disturbed by Trump\u2019s demand that Ukraine investigate one of his political rivals and feared it would undermine U.S. national security.\n\nVindman was part of a small group of White House officials assigned to listen in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump\u2019s manipulation of Ukraine policy to discredit Biden is unethical and damaging to U.S. national security.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman intends to tell lawmakers, according to a draft of his opening statement.\n\nVindman is the first White House official to testify who listened to Trump\u2019s controversial call, which was exposed by a government whistleblower and triggered a historic impeachment inquiry. His prepared statement bolsters previous testimony by Fiona Hill, his former boss at the National Security Council, and William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Greg Jaffe\n\n6:30 a.m.: Trump airs grievances in late-night tweets\n\nTrump went on Twitter late Monday night to air now-familiar grievances about the impeachment probe, taking aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and questioning why the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the inquiry hasn\u2019t appeared before Congress.\n\n\u201cThe only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff, when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress, together with numerous others on Shifty\u2019s side,\u201d Trump said in one tweet. \u201cSchiff should be Impeached, and worse!\u201d\n\nDuring an Intelligence Committee hearing last month, Schiff presented an embellished version of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. At the time, Schiff said he was conveying \u201cthe essence\u201d of what Trump had relayed to Zelensky. Schiff later said it was meant as a parody, something that he said should have been apparent to Trump.\n\nHouse members can be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the chamber but are not subject to impeachment.\n\nIn a separate tweet, Trump quoted Fox News host Laura Ingraham saying she saw \u201cno underlying crime\u201d in the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201c100% correct, and the Whistleblower disappeared after I released the transcript of the call,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhere is the Whistleblower? That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!\u201d\n\nDemocrats have said recently that they no longer think it is imperative to hear from the whistleblower, an anonymous U.S. intelligence official, because several witnesses have corroborated claims in his complaint.\n\n6:15 a.m.: Graham says he found nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) sought Monday night to minimize the damage of reports that Vindman would testify that he did not think it was proper for Trump to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and feared it undermined national security.\n\n\u201cAs to Colonel, he\u2019s entitled to his opinion about the phone call,\u201d Graham tweeted. \u201cI read the transcript and found nothing wrong with it.\u201d\n\nIn tweets, Graham also took issue with Vindman\u2019s opening statement being previewed in the New York Times and other media, including The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThis selective leaking without due process puts the presidency at risk,\u201d Graham tweeted.\n\nHe also accused Democrats of using \u201ca sham process for the purpose of driving down Trump\u2019s approval rating.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should come to an immediate end,\u201d Graham said.\n\n6 a.m.: \u2018Lock him up\u2019 chant ignites a debate among Democrats: Give Trump his own medicine, or stick to the high road?\n\nIt was one of the most memorable moments of Game 5 of the World Series, an eerily familiar chant that arose from the chorus of boos that erupted when Trump was shown on a giant screen at Nationals Park.\n\n\u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d\n\nThe phrase was no doubt delivered with some irony, as a largely elite crowd in the heart of a heavily liberal city offered its own spin on the anti-Hillary Clinton slogan that has become a staple of Trump\u2019s raucous rallies.\n\nBut while Trump and his allies have embraced \u201cLock her up!\u201d as a mantra for their movement, the seemingly spontaneous outburst in Washington on Sunday night highlighted an intensifying debate within the Democratic Party and among the broader Trump resistance: Whether to try to beat a norm-busting president on his terms, no matter how distasteful, or to insist on a more traditional, civil standard for American political discourse.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "The president tweeted Tuesday that he had never heard of Lt.
