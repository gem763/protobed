It is accessible to all police forces across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the Home Office are able to request data from it, according to documents sent to the human rights group Liberty and seen by the Guardian.\n\nThe stated aim of Prevent, a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend and crucially deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold.\n\n'My son was terrified': how Prevent alienates UK Muslims Read more\n\nEach Prevent referral received is added to the PCM database by individual police forces, including personal details and reasons for the referral, but the person is not notified, responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted by Liberty showed. Other agencies are able to request information held on the database.\n\nThe revelations about the existence of the database come at a time when Prevent is facing renewed scrutiny as an independent review begins, sparked by years of accusations that the programme had become a toxic brand that disproportionately targeted Muslims.\n\nPolice chiefs said recording referrals ensured accountability and allowed forces to understand when vulnerabilities are increasing.\n\nGracie Bradley, Liberty policy and campaigns manager, said: \u201cThis secret database isn\u2019t about keeping us safe. It\u2019s about keeping tabs on and controlling people \u2013 particularly minority communities and political activists.\n\n\u201cIt is utterly chilling that potentially thousands of people, including children, are on a secret government database because of what they\u2019re perceived to think or believe.\u201d\n\nAny rank of police officer or staff can access the database but users must be Prevent practitioners, who are vetted and given training prior to access.\n\nChief constables are the designated data controllers within their respective forces.\n\nThe exact number of individuals on the database is currently unknown but forces that responded to Liberty\u2019s request for information said all referrals were added at the time of receipt and official statistics show that 21,042 individuals have been referred in the three years to March 2018 alone.\n\nIn the most recent year available, 2017/18, a total of 7,318 individuals were subject to a referral but 3,096 or 42% left the process requiring no further action and 3,466 left the process and were signposted to alternative services.\n\nThe majority \u2013 4,144 or 57% \u2013 were aged 20 years or under. Within this figure, 2,009 were under 15 and 2,135 were aged 15 to 20.\n\nUltimately, only 394 were escalated to the Channel process, which provides specialist support to people who were deemed at risk of being drawn into terrorism following a number of assessments.\n\nPolice Prevent practitioners also have access to the Channel Management Information System which is a database of Prevent Channel cases, the responses said. CMIS is owned and managed by the Home Office.\n\nInformation on the database is derived from referrals made by public servants like teachers and doctors as well as police, who are compelled to monitor and report signs of what they believe could indicate extremism under a controversial statutory duty.\n\nIn its response, the Met police said an individual can challenge the decision and have their details removed but the challenge may not always be successful depending on the circumstances.\n\nHowever, the force did not elaborate on how that would be possible given that individuals are not aware their details are entered on the database.\n\nHarun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThat a database is being compiled by police forces detailing every Prevent referral is deeply worrying. That it is secret is even more concerning.\n\n\u201cThis database \u2013 over and above being a hugely authoritarian tool \u2013 will mean that the vast majority of those referred, who are found to have no terrorism link, will still be perceived as potential risks by the state, and this will disproportionately affect Muslims.\n\n\u201cOur questions on transparency, accountability and oversight around Prevent now become even more important.\u201d\n\nThe independent review of Prevent, announced in January, attracted controversy itself when it emerged the man appointed to lead the exercise, Lord Carlile, had admitted to parliament that he \u201cmay be somewhat biased towards\u201d the programme and had pledged his \u201cconsidered and strong support\u201d to it, prompting calls for him to step down.\n\nFurther criticism was triggered by the terms of reference for the review, published last month, which suggested the exercise would not \u201cconsider past decisions\u201d made under the programme.\n\nLord Carlile sought to reassure critics by claiming that \u201ceverything is up for discussion, including scrapping\u201d the programme.\n\nOne of four strands of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy known as Contest, Prevent was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. The statutory duty on schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism or terrorism was introduced in 2015.\n\nA National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council spokesman said: \u201cThe public would expect the police to maintain professional records of those individuals referred for support as potential victims of radicalisation. This is no different to the way we record other forms of supportive safeguarding activity such as child sexual exploitation, domestic abuse or human trafficking.\n\n\u201cGood records ensure we are accountable, allow us to understand when vulnerabilities are increasing, and ensure we act consistently and proportionately, only taking action in those cases where our support is necessary.\n\n\u201cIf we did not maintain proper, legally compliant records, the public would rightly have far less confidence in the police.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: Details of thousands referred to programme can be viewed without their knowledge", "authors": ["Jamie Grierson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d79ce3f5d563c8202fe8ea25ccbf379c7ac2384/0_98_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4ccd441db80124a7195fabeaa5b5258", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
