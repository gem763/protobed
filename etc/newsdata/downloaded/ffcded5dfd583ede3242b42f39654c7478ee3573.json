Its quarterly profit fell 23% to $7.07, hurt by investments in research, development, and marketing.\n\nExecutives noted that the company\u2019s advertising revenue \u2013 the bulk of its profit - hit $33.92bn in quarter three, compared with $28.95bn in the third quarter of last year. Alphabet\u2019s total revenue of $40.5bn beat analyst expectations.\n\nBig tech, big profits? Amazon sales poised to leap 24% Read more\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis,\u201d the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said on Monday. \u201cWe remain very focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe company also noted its revenues from \u201cother bets\u201d \u2013 including subsidiaries like the self-driving car company Waymo \u2013 came in at $155m, an increase from $146m in the third quarter of 2018.\n\nIt lost $941m during the quarter, up from a loss of $727m a year ago. Still, it maintains strong growth in advertising revenues, noted Nicole Perrin, a principal analyst at eMarketer, which is a \u201cgood sign for the bottom line of the ads business\u201d.\n\nThe world\u2019s dominant provider of internet search, advertising, and video services, Alphabet has increased spending in recent years on areas including cloud computing and consumer electronics that it views as essential to maintaining its industry leadership.\n\nThe disappointing earnings come as Google faces major challenges internally and from outside regulators. In September, 48 state attorneys general announced inquiries into Facebook and Google as calls to break up big tech companies increase. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and other Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential election have made antitrust issues central to their campaigns.\n\nMeanwhile employees have pushed back against company policies internally, including posting a public petition in August calling on Alphabet not to pursue a contract with US Customs and Border Protection or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Thousands of employees walked out of the company in 2018 to protest harassment policies.\n\nReuters contributed to this report", "description": "Disappointing earnings come as the company faces antitrust challenges and employees condemn policies", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7bff213178830b69b409f8357bc99385fda9bb8/0_0_4428_2657/master/4428.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eddb1b9347bb01d99addfd2385c37ff7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
