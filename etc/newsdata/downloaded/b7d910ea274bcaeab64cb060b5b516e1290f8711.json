That is used to ensure that the tips on the end of each AirPod Pro fit properly, and that they are sitting snug in your ear.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt does so by using \"advanced algorithms\" that take the sound from the microphones in each of the AirPods and measure the sound level, Apple said. It will then compare that with the sound that is coming out of the speaker driver, and from that work out whether the AirPod is seated properly in the ear and whether the ear tip is the right size.\n\nAfter that is working, the AirPods can also make use of Adaptive EQ, which uses similar features to improve the sound. Apple claims the earphones can \"automatically tune low- and mid-frequencies of the music to the shape of an individual\u2019s ear \u2014 resulting in a rich, immersive listening experience\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
