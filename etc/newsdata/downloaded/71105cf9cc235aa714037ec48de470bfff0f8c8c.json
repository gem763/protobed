Bolton, the national security adviser, in a battle for the competing instincts of a president who relishes tough talk but promised to wind down America\u2019s endless wars.\n\nAs they discussed terms of the agreement, Mr. Pompeo and his negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, made the case that it would enable Mr. Trump to begin withdrawing troops while securing a commitment from the Taliban not to shelter terrorists. Mr. Bolton, beaming in by video from Warsaw, where he was visiting, argued that Mr. Trump could keep his campaign pledge to draw down forces without getting in bed with killers swathed in American blood.\n\nMr. Trump made no decision on the spot, but at some point during the meeting the idea was floated to finalize the negotiations in Washington, a prospect that appealed to the president\u2019s penchant for dramatic spectacle. Mr. Trump suggested that he would even invite President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, whose government has not been party to the talks, and get him to sign on.", "description": "What would have been one of the biggest headline-grabbing moments of President Trump\u2019s tenure was put together on the spur of the moment and then canceled on the spur of the moment.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Mujib Mashal", "Michael Crowley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/world/09dc-prexy-promo/09dc-prexy-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
