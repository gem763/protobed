Let\u2019s just say shock was in short supply when Politico on Monday, citing dozens of sources, published a deep dive into the antics of Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not a school; we\u2019re a real estate hedge fund. We\u2019re not educating; we\u2019re buying real estate every year and taking students\u2019 money to do it.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s what one university official credited with inside knowledge of Liberty\u2019s finances told Politico, which cited several deals in which Falwell, an influential Donald Trump supporter, reportedly used school funds to enrich his own inner circle.\n\nOne of those sweetheart deals apparently involved Ben Crosswhite, Falwell\u2019s personal trainer. Liberty University in 2013 upgraded a fitness center so that Falwell and his wife could train there privately. Crosswhite bought the facility at a discount and was paid seven years in advance for Liberty\u2019s use. Crosswhite was reportedly the only prospective buyer allowed to bid.\n\n\u201cHell of a deal,\u201d a former high-ranking Liberty official was quoted in the story as saying. \u201cWe gave Ben everything he asked for.\u201d\n\nAs troubling as those, and many other questionable real-estate deals that were cited in the story, may be, the spiciest part of the piece focused on compromising photos and bawdy banter.\n\nSchool officials said Falwell had a text misfire when he meant to send a \u201cracy\u201d photo of his wife to Crosswhite but instead sent it to several others. This after online buzz had already focused on a \u201ccompromising\u201d photo of the Falwells that Reuters reported was covered up by Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, another official, supported by several further sources, said Falwell is \u201cvery, very vocal\u201d about his sex life, and \u201call he wanted to talk about was how he would nail his wife,\u201d along with several other R-rated details. He also reportedly shared a photo of her dressed in a French maid outfit.\n\nThat\u2019s just a taste of what Politico covered in the story, and, of course, Twitter TWTR, -2.55% couldn\u2019t get enough of all the salacious details:\n\nAny good Baptist would tell you that Jerry Falwell\u2019s descent into criminality probably started with the dancing. https://t.co/aAvJV5tWQP pic.twitter.com/ZBytHp0QkW \u2014 ana marie cox (@anamariecox) September 9, 2019\n\nAnother Trump suck up bites the dust.
