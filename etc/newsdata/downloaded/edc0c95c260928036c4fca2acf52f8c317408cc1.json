With the announcement, founding members of the BC Craft Farmers Co-Op will formally initiate the incorporation process this month, as required under the BC Cooperatives Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to take this important step today on behalf of the hundreds of micro-producers, processors and retailers we have met across the province over the past year,\" said Grow Tech Labs CEO Barinder Rasode. \"In addition to maintaining B.C.\u2019s position as an international cannabis leader and innovator, transitioning our extensive network of craft farmers into the legal marketplace will create thousands of jobs in rural communities and provide cannabis consumers around the world with the highest quality B.C. cannabis possible.\"\n\nA copy of the updated rules is available on a refreshed co-op web-site here at bccraftfarmerscoop.com/ . Proposed co-op members are invited to help chose a proposed BC Craft Farmers Co-Op logo here .\n\nGrow Tech Labs initiated the final phase of community consultation started in June, with the release of the draft co-op rules that reflected a preliminary round of engagement with small producers, processors and retailers across the province in the spring. Community roundtables, one-on-one meetings and digital surveys throughout July and August invited feedback on key elements of the proposed rules and a series of suggested names.\n\nSuggestions received throughout this consultation process have shaped the co-op\u2019s proposed mission, activities and governance structure. In addition to the name, a significant change was made to the proposed rules to provide for the establishment of four Co-Op Board Working Groups focused on quality, medical access, membership and investment. These were common themes identified during the most-recent summer engagement process. A summary of other improvements to the rules is available here .\n\nIf the BC government accepts the proposed rules from the founding members, the co-op will be established, members will be invited to join and the first Annual General meeting will be called to elect an independent Board of Directors and formally adopt the approved rules.\n\nFor more information, contact: natasha@growtechlabs.com", "description": "", "authors": ["Grow Tech Labs"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/581542?filename=581542.png&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
