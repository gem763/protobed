Food, energy, and water are a good application because the population is going to reach 10 billion by 2050. Right now, we are utilising 70% of fresh water for agriculture,\" he said.\n\n\"The challenge is by 2050, we're going to need almost twice the food production we have today. What that means is that we need 60% more food, 50% more energy, and there will also be a 10% increase in water usage.\n\n\"Of course, we can grow more crops, but we can't grow land. The question is how can we use technology efficiently to increase crop productivity.\"\n\nSee also: Top 5 things to know about farm tech (TechRepublic)\n\nLenovo workstations, such as the ThinkStation P920 equipped with high end GPUs together with Lenovo's LiCo AI framework, along with the ThinkStation P330 Tiny are being used by CGA to support deep learning algorithms that process large amounts of geospatial data collected from sensors in the field.\n\nVatsavai said the data sets are allowing CGA to provide real-time updates to farmers about how they can improve water and energy conservation.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is predict ... when [farmers] can schedule their irrigation, so it only happens when they need it. This is compared to standard irrigation system that you usually program ahead of time, and it will spray water whether it's needed or not,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly, the same methods have been applied to the way fertiliser is used, which when unused, can flow into nearby water sources and contaminate it, Vatsavai said.\n\n\"Right now with fertilisers, you program your tractor and it moves across the field with it. It does not change, it does not recognise whether there's soil or whether the crop is there, or whether the location needs it or not,\" he said.\n\n\"Last year alone more than $1 billion of fertiliser was wasted in the mid-west region in the United States \u2026 and this is where our research is focused on, to understand these challenges by using appropriate sensors, data, and machine learning.\"\n\nVatsavai added the same application can be applied to help farmers identify whether diseases are spreading across their crop or if weed is growing, which ultimately will allow them to address the problem earlier, rather than wait for the problem to escalate.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nOptimizing IoT for blueberry farms: A learning experience for Intel\n\nZDNet's Stephanie Condon tells Karen Roby how Intel improved its Connected Logistics Platform after conducting a pilot project with blueberry farmers.\n\nSwarmFarm scales up with AU$250,000 QLD government grant\n\nThe Queensland agtech startup plans to open a new on-farm office facility and hire 15 additional staff.\n\nFarmbot delivering remote watering solutions to Aussie farmers\n\nIt uses algorithms to detect abnormal behaviour in water levels to deliver near real-time reports to farmers.\n\nFarmbot delivering remote watering solutions to Aussie farmers\n\nGrants of up to AU$30,000 to cover two-thirds of the cost of IoT equipment for suitable farmers.", "description": "Researchers are processing large amounts of geospatial data using deep learning algorithms to help farmers make real-time decisions about water and energy usage.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/11/ab9d2ce5-1e6c-4bc7-900f-486392d74270/thumbnail/770x578/25346f089427f11ecc7ab7b759352cfc/istockphoto-abadonian-835879592.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
