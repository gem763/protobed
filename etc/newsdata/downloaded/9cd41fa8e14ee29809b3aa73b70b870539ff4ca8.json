Why? After all, points out Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at Barclays, the aggressive call has worked, even with a bond market rally. U.S. SPX, -0.24% and European SXXP, +0.76% stock markets have climbed between 17% and 23% this year while the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate index, which tracks a basket of government, corporate and asset-backed bonds, rose 6%\n\nBut the news flow on trade and data has clearly worsened. There are more tariffs now than three months ago. Every major economy is seeing an industrial and manufacturing slowdown, with Germany and Italy on the verge of recessions. Global trade volumes are falling and China\u2019s economy has downshifted.\n\nRajadhyaksha said 2020 isn\u2019t likely to be better. \u201cWith U.S. stimulus effects fading, Europe\u2019s policy cupboard mostly bare, the drag from tariffs yet to fully hit trade, and China unlikely to ride to the rescue, where will upside growth surprises come from,\u201d he asks. That said, Barclays is not forecasting a recession. \u201cServices the world over are still expanding. Global labor markets are in decent shape, even if job growth has slowed, and consumption should continue to support the world economy,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the call of the day, Barclays now prefers global fixed income over global equities. U.S. equities are fairly valued but face \u201casymmetric\u201d risks (when the downside risk is unequal, or greater, than the reward). Within stocks, the bank is overweight healthcare, software and the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google which is owned by Alphabet), and underweight utilities and real estate, energy and materials and financials. Rates on short-term bonds should move lower, and among other suggestions in the bond space it recommends 5-year U.S. Treasurys TMUBMUSD05Y, -2.14% . It expects a sharp depreciation in the British pound GBPUSD, -0.1781% to accompany the initial stages of a no-deal Brexit before a partial rebound by the end of 2020.\n\nThe markets\n\nA day after a 163-point gain on the Dow fueled by President Trump\u2019s remark that a deal with China could come sooner than you think, U.S. stock futures ES00, -0.29% YM00, -0.20% leaned higher.\n\nBond yields TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.15% edged lower, while gold GC00, +0.19% was steady.\n\nThe optimism over trade lifted stocks in Asia ADOW, +0.04% and Europe.\n\nThe buzz\n\nThe impeachment inquiry will get the lion\u2019s share of the headlines, with the Washington Post reporting a whistleblower alleges that White House officials moved the records of some of Trump\u2019s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network. White House officials said the call memo does not show the president seeking any quid pro quo, the report said.\n\nOn the trade front, China\u2019s government says importers have agreed to buy American soybeans and pork.\n\nFed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 11:45 a.m. Eastern, while across the Atlantic, a European Central Bank official quit without explanation. Peloton Interactive PTON, +0.00% the technology company that sells exercise machine, starts trading Thursday after pricing its initial public offering at $29 per share, at the top end of the targeted range. See 5 things to know about the Peloton IPO.\n\nBeyond Meat BYND, +10.31% rallied as McDonald\u2019s MCD, +0.63% says it will trial a plant-based burger. U.S.-listed shares of Pearson PSO, -14.25% may lose ground after a profit warning from the education publisher.\n\nThe chart\n\nTypically, the ratio between high-yield and investment-grade bond spreads tracks the ratio between large-cap and small-cap stocks. That\u2019s not the case now, as the chart shows, with investors showing a strong preference for large-cap stocks at the moment while not making a similar shift to highly rated bonds. UBS said it takes \u201csome confidence\u201d in the resilience of corporate credit and feels \u201cemboldened\u201d that there isn\u2019t a recession coming.\n\nRandom reads\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke for the first time about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside a Saudi consulate.\n\nChinese technology companies are investing in pig farms.\n\nJacques Chirac, who famously opposed the Iraq war as French president, has died.\n\nA chief executive of an Idaho company surprised employees by giving them an immediate $10,000 pay rise.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
