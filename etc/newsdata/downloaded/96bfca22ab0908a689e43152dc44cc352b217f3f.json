But when supporters of Barack Obama accused him of somehow being responsible for a woman who died from cancer, I jumped to his defense by pointing out the link between unnecessary deaths and bad economic policy.\n\nSimply stated, market-friendly policies produce more prosperity and wealthier societies enjoy longer lifespans. Indeed, even one of Obama\u2019s top appointees openly acknowledged that wealthier is healthier.\n\nWhich is why folks on the left are failing to do proper cost-benefit analysis when they assert that we need redistribution and intervention to help people live longer.\n\nThis issue was hot in 2017 when Republicans briefly toyed with the idea of fulfilling a campaign promise and repealing Obamacare.\n\nDefenders of the law said repeal would cause needless deaths.\n\nIn a column for National Review, Oren Cass debunked those assertions.\n\nIf you are going to claim that someone\u2019s policy will cause upward of 200,000 deaths, I feel that you should have relevant supporting evidence. Maybe I\u2019m just old-fashioned that way. Certainly, no such standards seem to hamper the editors at Vox. Instead, they\u2019ve just published \u201c208,500 additional deaths could occur by 2026 under the Senate health plan,\u201d in which Ann Crawford-Roberts et al. assure readers that they are using \u201csolid estimates firmly rooted in scientific evidence \u2014 unlike the dubious claim that the ACA has saved \u2018zero\u2019 lives.\u201d Except here\u2019s the thing: That claim about zero lives saved is supported by multiple independent lines of analysis. \u2026There are the numerous studies showing that patients on Medicaid achieve worse health outcomes than those without any insurance. There is the \u201cgold-standard\u201d randomized controlled trial in Oregon that found no significant improvement in physical health from Medicaid coverage. \u2026There is a paper from Yale researchers that found states achieve better health outcomes when they allocate less of their social spending toward health care. And now we even have data from the ACA itself. \u2026the nation\u2019s mortality rate stopped decreasing and actually increased when the ACA was implemented, and matters were worst in the states that accepted the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \u2026None of that makes Medicaid worthless. It does not mean that Medicaid, or the ACA generally, is killing people (though the evidence for that proposition looks as good as the evidence for the idea that it is saving many lives).\n\nMax Bloom also wrote that year about the controversy for National Review.\n\nRepealing Obamacare will kill 24,000 people a year! No, 36,000! No, 43,000! The tax cuts are blood money! There is more than a little hyperbole about the overhaul of Obamacare proposed by the House and the Senate, and the rhetoric about tens of thousands of deaths is not a bad example. \u2026The only thing better than a natural experiment is a random experiment, in which people are randomly distributed into groups that, in this case, either receive health insurance or don\u2019t. Exactly this happened in Oregon in 2008, when the state randomly selected 30,000 from a waiting list of 90,000 low-income adults to participate in a limited expansion of Medicaid. In theory, this should have produced a perfect test of the effects of insurance on health-care outcomes \u2014 indeed, as Peter Suderman notes, a bevy of liberal writers touted an early analysis of the experiment as a conclusive vindication of the effects of health insurance. Until they saw the final data, that is. The Oregon study found that \u201cMedicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first two years.\u201d \u2026In short, the only problem with the estimate that Obamacare repeal will kill tens of thousands is that it cherry-picks one study out of several, ignores the limitations of that study, assumes that private insurance and Medicaid are equivalent, assumes that losing health insurance and gaining health insurance are precisely symmetric, uses implausible estimates of coverage loss, and relies on an idiosyncratic definition of the word \u201ckill.\u201d Otherwise, it\u2019s fine.\n\nBy the way, these two articles didn\u2019t even consider the \u201ccost\u201d side of cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThe columns simply noted that there\u2019s no evidence for the notion that Obamacare-type subsidies help people live longer. In other words, the \u201cbenefit\u201d side of cost-benefit equation is empty.\n\nSo imagine what we would discover about health outcomes if various Obamacare costs (job losses, tax increases, lower income, etc) were added to the analysis.\n\nA similar debate is happening on the other side of the ocean.\n\nIn a column for CapX, Guy Dampier addresses the silly claim that spending restraint kills people.\n\n\u2026a November 2017 paper in the British Medical Journal\u2026found a link between restrictions on health and social care spending \u2013 austerity \u2013 and 120,000 additional deaths between 2010 and 2017. The paper\u2019s authors..reached this by extrapolating from an estimated 45,000 \u201chigher than expected\u201d number of deaths between 2011 and 2014 and then projecting that to cover 2010 to 2017. \u2026although even they had to admit they had only captured association and not discovered causation. \u2026The medical community responded to the BMJ paper with scepticism. \u2026Others pointed out the many issues in the methodology. \u2026the IPPR, a think tank with close links to Labour, published a report in June this year with a similar claim: that if trends in mortality between 1990 and 2012 had continued there \u201ccould have been 130,000 deaths averted between 2012 and 2017\u201d. \u2026When pressed the IPPR admitted that the apparent spike in mortality had started two years before austerity began\u2026 The years of austerity have been tough for many people, without doubt. But these issues show that neither claim \u2013 of 120,000 or 130,000 deaths \u2013 stands up to scrutiny.\n\nOnce again, the left\u2019s numbers only look at one side of the equation.\n\nThere\u2019s no attempt to measure the health benefits of a faster-growing, less-encumbered economy.\n\nYet even using incomplete analysis, they don\u2019t have any persuasive evidence for bigger government.\n\nLet\u2019s now close by looking at a global example.\n\nLast year, the Washington Post published a fascinating article on pollution and life expectancy, and it included analysis on which parts of the world are getting cleaner and dirtier.\n\nUniversity of Chicago researchers wanted to make air quality measurements less abstract and more relatable \u2014 and what is more relatable than years of life? The pollution most responsible for shortening lives consists of the tiniest airborne particles, called PM2.5. They are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing breathing and cardiovascular problems, cancer and possibly even dementia. They\u2019re bad for healthy people and terrible for young children, the elderly and anyone who already has heart or respiratory problems. \u2026The Chicago team started with satellite data that mapped the annual PM2.5 concentration in air all over the world, from 1998 to 2016. \u2026Then they calculated how much longer people would live if the air they breathe had fewer \u2014 or none \u2014 of these particles. The result of the project is the Air Quality Life Index.\n\nHere\u2019s the accompanying map, which shows good news for most parts of the world other than China, India, and Indonesia.\n\nThe obvious takeaway from this article is that nations should strive mightily to reduce this type of air pollution. Especially in Asia.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s actually true.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider both sides of the equation. These Asian nations are in the process of industrialization, which means they are getting much richer and therefore have the ability to enjoy much better levels of food, housing, and health care.\n\nWe also know that life expectancy has significantly improved in China. So the bad impact of pollution obviously is being offset by something.\n\nAnd the article notes that China is now working to curtail pollution, which makes sense since nations become more environmentally conscious as incomes increase.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m not trying to identify the right tradeoff between pollution and growth. Or the ideal tradeoff between redistribution and growth.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m simply pointing out that tradeoffs exist, even if some of my friends on the left like to pretend otherwise.", "description": "For a\u00a0multitude of reasons, I wasn\u2019t a fan of Mitt .10/15/2019 10:57:12AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
