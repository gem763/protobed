Residents say the peace that a 2016 deal was supposed to bring has not arrived\n\nWhen she launched her campaign to be the town\u2019s first female mayor, Karina Garc\u00eda was already household name in Su\u00e1rez, a conflict-ridden municipality in western Colombia.\n\nColombian activists face 'extermination' by criminal gangs Read more\n\nAt 32, she had already served as a councilwoman there, and later as the government\u2019s local human rights representative \u2013 earning a reputation for working long hours and uniting disparate indigenous farming communities with the largely Afro-Colombian urban centre.\n\n\u201cKarina tried to help everyone in her community,\u201d Orlando Garc\u00eda, her father, told the Guardian.\n\nIt was that sense of duty that led to her death.\n\nAt nightfall on 1 September, Garc\u00eda was traveling along a winding dirt road, on her way back from meeting rural leaders. Just a few miles from town, the armoured SUV she was traveling in was ambushed by assailants who opened fire with automatic weapons and threw at least one grenade.\n\nGarc\u00eda, her mother and two others were killed. Her bodyguard was severely injured.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t beat her with arguments, so they did it with grenades,\u201d Garc\u00eda\u2019s father said in the living room of his house in the nearby city of Santander de Quilichao. \u201cThis is the price you pay for trying to do honest politics in Colombia.\u201d\n\nGarc\u00eda was a candidate for the Liberal party, a broad church that \u2013 along with its rival Conservatives \u2013 dominated Colombian politics for most of the past century, until both gave way to insurgent new parties.\n\nHer death made her the seventh candidate to be murdered in advance of local elections this Sunday for governors, mayors, and city councillors across Colombia.\n\nThe string of political killings has shaken the country, reminding many of the wanton political violence of past decades, when thousands of candidates \u2013 including three presidential contenders \u2013 were killed on the campaign trail.\n\nA 2016 peace deal with the leftwing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) was supposed to usher in a new chapter of tranquility, formally ending half a century of civil war that killed 260,000 and forced over 7 million from their homes.\n\nBut while the Farc demobilization removed one faction from Colombia\u2019s labyrinthine war \u2013 and an overarching narrative for the violence \u2013 peace never truly arrived: local conflicts over the drug trade, land rights and mineral resources continue to fuel violence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In her father\u2019s home, photos of Karina Garc\u00eda growing up show her love of horses and the countryside. Photograph: Joe Parkin Daniels\n\nAccording to Colombia\u2019s human rights ombudsman, 486 activists and human rights defenders have been murdered since January 2016, most of them in rural areas like Su\u00e1rez, where dissident rebel groups, local mafias and drug traffickers with paramilitary origins still jostle for strategic territory and economic and political power.\n\n\u201cSu\u00e1rez has always had its problems. Our Karina\u2019s death is just the latest example,\u201d said Mar\u00eda del Pilar, a local social worker who knew the candidate. \u201cNothing changes around here,\u201d she added, masking her pain.\n\nSu\u00e1rez, with a population of 20,000, sits in the Andean mountains beside the fast-flowing River Cauca, from which the surrounding province takes its name.\n\nIt is a modest place, but the highlands which loom over the village contain great riches: fields of coca \u2013 the key ingredient in cocaine \u2013 and rich seams of gold.\n\nEfrain Ceron, the priest of the town\u2019s Catholic parish, said the armed groups fighting for local control would not be swayed by any talk of peace. \u201cThere is simply too much money to be made in the hills,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Su\u00e1rez, the peace process may have actually poured fuel on the fire: the conflict had for decades deterred multinational mining companies from exploring the region\u2019s gold deposits, leaving the mountain\u2019s riches for local artisanal miners.\n\nBut since 2016, fears grew that outsiders would come for the gold. Garc\u00eda\u2019s political opponents seized on such concerns, and rumours began to spread that she planned to invite multinational corporations \u2013 and with them, paramilitary enforcers \u2013 to Su\u00e1rez.\n\nHer murder was a tragedy of a death foretold. Just a week before she died, Garc\u00eda posted a video on her Facebook page denying the rumours \u2013 and begging for an end to the whispering campaign against her.\n\nShe was incredibly brave and incredibly driven. Her death hit everyone in this town - not just her supporters Efrain Ceron\n\n\u201cPlease, for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t act so irresponsibly,\u201d she pleaded in the video. \u201cThis could be fatal.\u201d\n\nToday, Garc\u00eda still haunts the town. Her campaign posters still hang from walls and lampposts, but many are defaced, her image blacked out with spray paint.\n\nFor weeks after her death, the upbeat jingles of her ads still chimed on local radio; her campaign team had booked commercial space by the month.\n\nIn the days following her assassination, locals held a candle-lit procession and erected a shrine at her humble campaign headquarters on the town\u2019s main square.\n\nUnlike many politicians across the country, Garc\u00eda was widely liked in the community.\n\n\u201cShe was incredibly brave and incredibly driven,\u201d said Ceron, the priest. \u201cHer death hit everyone in this town - not just her supporters.\u201d\n\nBelatedly, the military presence has been stepped up, with heavily armed soldiers in fatigues zipping up and down the steep streets on motorcycles.\n\nPresident Iv\u00e1n Duque convened his security council in the regional capital, Popay\u00e1n, and swiftly put the blame on dissident Farc rebels \u2013 a minority of the group who have refused to disarm.\n\nDuque also blamed drug traffickers, working with \u201cinternational cartels\u201d, for the breakdown in public security in the region. Locals in Su\u00e1rez agree that Mexico\u2019s feared Sinaloa cartel is present in the region, where it influences local gangs.\n\n'Based in hatred': violence against women standing in Colombia's elections Read more\n\n\u201cAs to the bandit who vilely murdered the candidate \u2026 we are going to hunt him and bring him to justice,\u201d Duque told local media.\n\nBut the president\u2019s words ring hollow for Garc\u00eda\u2019s grieving father, who argues that the Colombian state shares responsibility for her death. \u201cShe asked for extra bodyguards and a more heavily armoured vehicle, and they did nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe family is still waiting for Garc\u00eda\u2019s remains to be handed over, though her father identified the body where it lay next to her burned-out car.\n\n\u201cI got to the scene hours before the authorities,\u201d he said, a tear in his eye.\n\nHer cousin Enver Velasco said that her murder was a warning to other grassroots progressives. \u201cLook at what this says to other parents across the country, when their children tell them they want to go into politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they would let them, because they know what happened to Karina.\u201d\n\nGarc\u00eda\u2019s father drew the opposite conclusion: \u201cKarina would never throw in the towel. She just wasn\u2019t made that way.\u201d", "description": "Karina Garc\u00eda is the latest candidate to be killed ahead of local elections.
