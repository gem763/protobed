It\u2019s the day that Larry Culp, the celebrated former CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR), was named the new CEO of General Electric. Investors loved the move: the GE stock price closed 7% higher on the news. The hope was that Culp, who had presided over significant operating improvements at one industrial conglomerate, could work his magic at another.\n\nThat hope seemed to fade quickly. Amid a plunging broad market, General Electric stock kept falling. In December, it briefly dipped below its financial crisis low of $6.66, touching a 25-year low in the process. A better broad market sparked an early 2019 rally, but accusations of accounting fraud last month sent shares tumbling.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor all the volatility and news, the irony is that not all that much seems to have changed in the last 11 months \u2014 other than the GE stock price. Even the most bullish GE investor knew that Culp\u2019s turnaround efforts were going to take years to pay off. I\u2019ve long been a GE bear, but even I have to admit: investors buying the turnaround last year should be absolutely loving General Electric stock below $9.\n\nA Busy Year for General Electric Stock\n\nFrom one standpoint, GE stock looks very different now than it did last October. The company has aggressively sold assets to reduce its debt. Last month, GE Capital agreed to sell its aircraft leasing business for an estimated $4 billion to Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) and Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH). That follows a roughly $1 billion sale of energy investments to Apollo last year.\n\nIn February, GE merged its transportation unit with Wabtec (NYSE:WAB), picking up cash in the process. It amended its agreements with Baker Hughes, a GE Company (NYSE:BHGE), and raised a few billion more in an offering of BHGE shares. Most notably, it agreed to sell its GE BioPharma business to Danaher for $21 billion.\n\nThere have been concerns about the exposure of GE Aviation to the 737 MAX debacle at Boeing (NYSE:BA). As noted above, the company was accused of accounting fraud in GE Capital\u2019s long-term healthcare business. GE Power showed signs of life in the second quarter.\n\nSimply put, there has been a ton of news when it comes to General Electric stock. And yet, from another perspective, not all that much has changed.\n\nHas the Story Changed?\n\nAs far as the asset sales and spin-offs go, it\u2019s not entirely clear that they created \u2014 or destroyed \u2014 all that much value for GE stock. General Electric obviously is giving up profit streams in exchange for near-term cash. That improves the balance sheet \u2014 a key reason why General Electric bonds have outperformed General Electric stock \u2013 but doesn\u2019t necessarily change the total value of General Electric\u2019s business.\n\nEven the big sale to Danaher, which seemed like a logical step, wound up ending hopes for a spinoff of GE Healthcare. GE sold its Baker Hughes shares at $23; BHGE closed Friday at $23.53. The Alstom acquisition remains a weight around the neck of GE Power. The 737 MAX issues at Boeing could be good news \u2013 more spare parts sales for existing aircraft \u2013 while engine issues with that manufacturer\u2019s 777X add to the sense that Aviation truly is the hinge when it comes to GE stock.\n\nEven at GE Capital, it\u2019s not as if investors didn\u2019t know there were problems in the long-term healthcare business. The company took a $6 billion charge in January 2018 related to the unit. An analyst argued last October that reserves still weren\u2019t high enough.\n\nFrom a broad standpoint, this is a company still in year one of a multi-year turnaround. Power still needs to get fixed. Healthcare is a good business. Aviation likely is as well. And GE Capital seems like a black hole.", "description": "On Oct. 1, 2018, the General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock price closed at $11.62.
