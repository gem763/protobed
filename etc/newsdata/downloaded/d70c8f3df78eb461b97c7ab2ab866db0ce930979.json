Being able to observe the content of transactions may raise privacy concerns. ING director Mariana Gomez de la Villa explained:\n\n\u201cIn the case of the validating one, the notary sees the contents of a transaction before it determines if the information is correct, which means participants lose privacy. [...] A non-validating notary doesn\u2019t see a transaction\u2019s content, which creates a security risk where the notary could sign off the wrong transaction if a malicious participant builds an invalid transaction. However it protects participants against double-spends, an attack where someone could spend the same asset twice, as does the validating notary.\u201d\n\nING\u2019s solution introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) notary service to validate transactions, that can purportedly evaluate the validity of a transaction without compromising on safety and without revealing any private contents.\n\nIn the cryptography world, ZKP is known as a method that allows one party to prove to another party that a statement is true without giving up any additional information. Zero-knowledge proofs were defined for the first time in a 1988 paper published by researchers from MIT and the University of Toronto as \u201cthose proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in questions.\u201d\n\nZKPs allow for greater privacy on public blockchains and could fuel growth in blockchain adoption by reducing the expensive and time-consuming process of setting up private networks.\n\nING CEO says the bank might cut ties with Facebook\n\nCointelegraph reported previously that ING CEO Ralph Hamers stated that banks may be inclined to stop working with social media giant Facebook if the firm goes ahead with the planned launch of its Libra stablecoin. Hamers explained that banks such as his have a rather low-risk approach:", "description": "The Dutch bank ING found a solution to improve the security and privacy trade-off on R3\u2019s Corda, an open-source blockchain platform", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy83Njc4YTYyMGIyYWEwOTA0MTc1YjQwMGIwMDQyODE2Yi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
