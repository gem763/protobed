She sits alongside a pool in the buff, wearing only an oversized pink hat.\n\nThe interview for the cover story was conducted by Lena Dunham and centers on Moore\u2019s book, Inside Out. The Girls star describes it as \u201chonest and arresting\u201d as Moore writes about the \u201cemotional poverty\u201d she suffered after finding fame, \u201cthe sort that only decades of tabloid harassment and unchecked trauma can alchemize.\u201d The book covers Moore\u2019s \u201cdivorces, addiction and eventual isolation\u201d with a \u201cno-f**ks woman of wisdom.\u201d\n\nBuzzy moments from the book include Moore recounting being a child and pulling pills out of her mother\u2019s mouth as she overdosed, finding out the man who she thought was her father wasn\u2019t and getting sober twice \u2014 in her 20s and again in her 50s.\n\nBut really it\u2019s the cover, the cover, the cover that people are talking about. As Moore creeps toward 60, the Ghost, G.I. Jane and Indecent Proposal star receives praise for doing the shoot and looking so beautiful. On her page, the comments include, \u201cLooking as gorgeous as you always have\u201d and \u201cHow are you real?\u201d with a little \u201caye Chihuahua\u201d sprinkled as well as a Benjamin Button reference.\n\nPeople react to Demi Moore's nude Harper's Bazaar cover.

She was headline news back in 1991 when she graced the cover of Vanity Fair (\u201cDemi\u2019s Big Moment\u201d) while naked and pregnant with her second child, Scout Willis.\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop there. A year later, Moore did it again (\u201cDemi\u2019s Birthday Suit\u201d) \u2014 that time with body paint. It was a whole decade of going bare, also covering Rolling Stone sans clothes in 1995.\n\nInside Out: A Memoir will be released on Sept. 24.
