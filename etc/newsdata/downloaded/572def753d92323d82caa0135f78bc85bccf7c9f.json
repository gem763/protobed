Bush\u2019s secretary of state, he found an information-technology system predating the internet. Some departments were still using computers from Wang Laboratories, which went bankrupt in 1992.\n\nHe told them, \u201cI am now chief information officer, the secretary of state, and we are going to fix this,\u201d Mr. Powell said onstage Tuesday, addressing attendees at the Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo.\n\nMr. Powell ordered 44,000 computers\u2014\u201dDon\u2019t ask me how I got the money, because I won\u2019t tell you\u201d\u2014and worked with the Central Intelligence Agency, which handled the State Department\u2019s infrastructure, to double computing capacity.\n\n\u201cThis is not just hardware; I gave them software and now I had to change the brainware,\u201d said Mr. Powell, a retired four-star general and veteran of the Persian Gulf War, Vietnam and the invasion of Panama.\n\nOver his 35 years in the U.S. Army, and during stints as national security adviser to President Reagan and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush, Mr. Powell has had access to plenty of hardware, much of it deadly. But it\u2019s brainware that proved to be the most potent tool in what he sees as a lifetime of leadership-building alliances, both on the world stage and within his own areas of command.\n\nMr. Powell told the audience of information-technology professionals about lessons he learned on leadership and service, as well as IT.\n\nA command of information technology helped him serve the mission. But face-to-face alliance-building and the occasional glass of vodka with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014\u201ca good way to do deals\u201d\u2014was fundamental to his success as a leader.\n\nMr. Powell made sure to establish his technology bona fides to the audience.\n\nIn 1969, after his second tour of Vietnam, Mr. Powell went to graduate school for two years to study computers, despite his C average as an undergraduate. His thesis was about International Business Machines Corp. \u2019s \u201cunbundling\u201d of software and services from hardware sales. \u201cIf there is anybody in the room who needs help with Fortran or Cobol, I am your man,\u201d he said.\n\nHe watched over the years as the Army evolved into what he described as the \u201cmost sophisticated organization on the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nBut technology alone doesn\u2019t define information systems. Culture and leadership play equally important roles. Mr. Powell described a career dedicated to keeping information lines open, encouraging subordinates to own their expertise and speak out as necessary, even when they disagreed with their superior officers.\n\nAt the end of the Cold War, with the Soviet Union dissolving, Mr. Powell, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, faced the task of reconfiguring the military. The reorganization required cost cuts, and he had to lead branches of the military that didn\u2019t always see eye to eye.\n\n\u201cHow do you bring diverse teams together?\u201d asked Mr. Powell, who was raised in the South Bronx by Jamaican immigrant parents and learned some Yiddish from Jewish neighbors. His solution: Have the chiefs of staff representing the four military services come in and talk with no assistants and no agenda.\n\nAfter the collision in April 2001 of a Chinese jet fighter and U.S. Navy intelligence aircraft off the coast of China, Mr. Powell gave his personal phone number to China\u2019s foreign minister, with instructions to call him anytime. Mr. Powell said the Chinese couldn\u2019t believe that he had provided his personal number.\n\nAnother lesson: During a visit to the Oval Office, Mr. Powell, then serving as national security adviser, was telling President Reagan about a problem. The president responded by commenting on the squirrels outside the window.\n\nIt took Mr. Powell a trip back to his own office to realize the meaning of the conversation. \u201cWhat he was saying was \u2018Colin, I trust you, I have confidence in you\u2026and I trust you in this range of decision-making.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI never forgot that,\u201d said Mr. Powell, who has taken the same approach with his own teams. \u201cIf the purpose is obvious and they believe in it and if you take care of them\u2026you will have a high-functioning organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had junior officers nine grades below me\u2026.I said you argue back with me. If you don\u2019t agree with me, I expect you in that area, to argue with me\u2026.March right back in here, tell me I was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what you are paid to do\u2026.That what\u2019s leadership is all about.\u201d", "description": "Finding out-of-date computers when he arrived at the State Department in 2001, Colin Powell upgraded hardware and software, but found \u201cbrainware\u201d the toughest to change.", "authors": ["Tom Loftus", "Thomas.Loftus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FG973_ColinP_SOC_20191022171410.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
