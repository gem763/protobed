But each marathon you go into is always different and last year in Chicago was the best I have felt in all my marathons.\u201d\n\nFarah\u2019s rivals include his former Nike Oregon Project teammate Galen Rupp, who, on Friday, was repeatedly asked about his relationship with Salazar, who is now banned from coaching the American runner.\n\nPlay Video 1:32 Bullish Mo Farah hits out at media 'agenda' \u2013 video\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had any contact, professional contact, sport-related contact with him since the announcement came out,\u201d Rupp said.\n\nThat led some to question whether the American might be violating IAAF rules, which state that an athlete is not allowed to work with a banned coach otherwise they will be charged with prohibited association and face a two-year ban.\n\nAn IAAF spokesperson confirmed that personal contact was allowed provided it did not stray into coaching. Whether such a rule is enforceable, however, is another matter.", "description": "A defiant Alberto Salazar has insisted that he never misled Mo Farah while coaching the Briton during his seven years at the Nike Oregon Project", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c23091751967186d5d8bb0310d3774a3108e51e/201_497_4589_2753/master/4589.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=823ef346534350f9341e36f898cf58c6", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
