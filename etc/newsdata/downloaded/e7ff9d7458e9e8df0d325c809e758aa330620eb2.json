I\u2019ve loved being part of the show, and am so grateful for the phenomenal support we have received.\n\n\"I want to say a special thank you to Janette for believing in me, and giving me the confidence to believe in myself.\n\n\"The things we achieved, from our couple\u2019s choice dance, through to the lifts in our salsa, will stay with me forever. I\u2019ve had the time of my life.\u201d\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\nHis scans have shown that his injury, which was obtained during rehearsals for the jive, may take up to six months for his injury to heal.\n\nThe first celebrity forced to pull out of the competition was Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing, who injured himself before the competition even began.\n\nJamie landed awkwardly during the red carpet launch, consequently hurting his leg.\n\nHe was replaced by Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher, who was paired with Oti Mabuse and looks set to make it through to the latest stages of the contest.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing \u2019s executive producer Sarah James said: \u201cWe are so sad that Will is unable to continue on the show. He is an incredible and talented person who has brought us some unforgettable moments this series - in particular his powerful and moving couples choice routine.\n\n\"He will be greatly missed and we wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing returns next Saturday at 7pm on BBC One", "description": "Paralympian Will Bayley has quit Strictly Come Dancing after his 'freak injury' has failed to recover", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734030.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-EROTEME_191026UT11_SCD_094JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
