That's what I did,\" he told reporters via telephone after the award announcement.\n\nPhysics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week; William Kaelin, Gregg Semenza and Peter Ratcliffe shared the medicine prize on Monday for discoveries about how cells respond to oxygen levels.\n\nAmong the Nobels, physics has often taken centre stage with winners featuring some of the greatest names in science like Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, as well as ground-breaking inventors such as radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi.\n\nUsing theoretical tools and calculations, Peebles was able to interpret trace radiation from the infancy of the universe and so discover new physical processes, the academy said.\n\nIt said that Mayor and Queloz announced the first discovery of a planet outside our own solar system, a so-called \"exoplanet\", starting a revolution in astronomy. Over 4,000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way.\n\n\"With numerous projects planned to start searching for exoplanets, we may eventually find an answer to the eternal question of whether other life is out there,\" it said.
