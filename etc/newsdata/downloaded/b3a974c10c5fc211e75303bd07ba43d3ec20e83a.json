(AP) - Jared Goff made NFL history when he completed 45 passes against Tampa Bay. No quarterback in the league\u2019s 100 years ever had more completions in a single game.\n\nThis noteworthy achievement did not prompt a celebration at the Los Angeles Rams\u2018 training complex Monday.\n\nThat\u2019s because it underlined two problems for a 3-1 team: The Rams couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t run the ball with Todd Gurley again, and they had to spend all Sunday playing from behind in their 55-40 loss to the Buccaneers.\n\nThe defending NFC champions know they\u2019ve got offensive flaws to fix, and Goff\u2019s career-best 517-yard day was a symptom of them. Goff\u2019s 45 completions tied Drew Bledsoe\u2019s single-game NFL record from 1994, while his 68 pass attempts were the third-most behind Bledsoe\u2019s 70, six of which came in an overtime win by New England.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s not a world we want to live in,\u201d Goff said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not built for success that way. Unfortunately, we were down early and had to use that as our game plan, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something we want to live by.\u201d\n\nThe Rams have only three days to prepare for their trip to Seattle (3-1) for their first division game of the season Thursday. A loss would put them into third place in the NFC West after the Rams never spent a day out of first place in coach Sean McVay\u2019s first two seasons.\n\nMcVay blamed the Rams\u2018 28 yards rushing - including 16 on five carries for Gurley, the most productive running back in the NFL over the past four seasons - on several early penalties leading to a 21-0 deficit. After falling so far behind, McVay felt he had to throw incessantly.\n\n\u201cWe never really got back into our normal down-and-distance operation, where we could be underneath the center and have some run-pass balance,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI think that puts a lot of stress on the quarterback, on the offensive line.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t explain the Rams\u2018 season-long ineffectiveness with the zone running attack that was so good during McVay\u2019s first two seasons, and which the Rams count on to set up their play-action proficiency. McVay insists he is determined to get Los Angeles back in the rushing business, but it won\u2019t be any easier in Seattle.\n\nThe Rams have dropped from the ranks of the NFL\u2019s unbeaten five games earlier than they did last season, which ended with a trip to the Super Bowl. The Rams still believe they have superior talent, so they feel their biggest obstacles are themselves.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 veteran leaders sound confident they\u2019ll emerge from this setback with motivation and focus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so used to winning,\u201d defensive lineman Michael Brockers said. \u201cEverybody expects to win, so coming from a game like that, you always take a piece of that little humble pie, you know? You\u2019ve got to sit down, kind of gather yourself and say, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nAlthough Jameis Winston passed for 385 yards and four touchdowns while facing very little pass rush, the Rams\u2018 secondary wasn\u2019t embarrassed as much as the numbers suggest. Marcus Peters added a pick-six in the fourth quarter to a solid coverage game, while safeties Eric Weddle and John Johnson combined for a whopping 26 tackles.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe Rams have committed seven turnovers in the last two games, including four against the Buccaneers. Goff has fumbled in 11 of his last 12 games - all except the Super Bowl - and though he recovered some of those fumbles, he knows ball security is an issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really happened when I\u2019ve been throwing,\u201d said Goff, whose late fumble against Tampa Bay was returned by Suh for the clinching TD. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m conscious of, but I have to throw.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nCooper Kupp leads the NFC with 388 yards receiving after his third straight 100-yard performance. Kupp has returned from injury with a phenomenal first quarter of the new year. He\u2019s not alone, either: Robert Woods has 307 yards receiving, and Brandin Cooks has 296.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nAaron Donald has a modest 10 tackles and one sack through four games, but it\u2019s not entirely the two-time AP Defensive Player of the Year\u2019s fault: He is being double-teamed more than any player in the NFL. The Rams didn\u2019t sign a proportional replacement for Ndamukong Suh on the defensive line, and Donald has yet to find his way through the morass of blockers applied to him constantly in Suh\u2019s absence.\n\nINJURED\n\nPeters initially wasn\u2019t on the Rams\u2018 injury report despite the brutal hit put on him by Tampa Bay lineman Donovan Smith during his TD interception return . Peters was added to the report later Monday with a facial injury, but McVay said he passed the concussion tests and appears to be on track to play at Seattle.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n26th: Where Goff\u2019s 82.9 passer rating ranks among NFL quarterbacks.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nPete Carroll has lost three straight to McVay, and the Rams have won in three of their last four trips to Seattle. The Seahawks are amply motivated for a statement-making win in the NFC West race. Los Angeles has almost always responded to such challenges under McVay, but it\u2019s tough to predict how this year\u2019s team will handle it.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jared Goff made NFL history when he completed 45 passes against Tampa Bay.
