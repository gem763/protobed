The mission, on its surface, aims to keep these oil fields in the hands of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Washington\u2019s former allies in the fight against IS.\n\nThe American troops, he said, will \u201crespond with overwhelming military force against any group who threatens the safety of our forces there.\u201d When asked whether the US would potentially respond with force against Russian or Syrian forces, Esper simply responded \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nEsper: US troops will \u201cremain positioned\u201d to deny ISS oil fields and will \u201crespond with overwhelming military force against any group who threatens the safety of our forces there.\u201d Says fields give SDF vital cash flow. \u2014 Aaron Mehta (@AaronMehta) October 28, 2019\n\nExtraordinary. Per press conference with Defense Secretary Esper and Gen. Milley, US troops are deployed to Syrian oil fields not only to deny access to ISIS, but also so SDF can monetize them and afford to maintain prisons and continue anti-ISIS fight. \u2014 Samuel Oakford (@samueloakford) October 28, 2019\n\nMilley says US forces have secured the oil fields against ISIS -- Esper says Kurdish forces need the oil revenue to keep guarding ISIS camps, implicitly confirming (I think) that they're also secured against Syria/Russia. \u2014 Oblivier Knox (@OKnox) October 28, 2019\n\nEsper\u2019s apparent threat comes hot on heels of Moscow accusing the US of facilitating the oil smuggling in Syria. Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov called the US oilfield operation \u201cstate-sponsored banditry,\u201d and accused Washington of leaving its forces there to help oil smugglers pillage Syria\u2019s national resources. The ministry published aerial images on Saturday, that it claims show crude oil being smuggled out of the country \u201cunder the strong protection of the US.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian MoD says US protects oil smugglers in Syria, offers aerial images as proof\n\nThough much noise has been made about protecting the oil fields from the remnants of IS, the shattered jihadist group has not made any moves towards seizing them. Asked whether the fields and the American forces there were under any threat, Esper replied \u201cnot at this time.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump had previously promised to bring all of the 1,000 or so US troops in Syria home, after the withdrawal from the country\u2019s north. However, some will be moved to Iraq, while more will now remain behind at the oil fields. It is still unclear how many troops will stay in Syria.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
