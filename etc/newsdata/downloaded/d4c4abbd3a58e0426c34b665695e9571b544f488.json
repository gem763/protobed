It\u2019s the one everyone rallies around at any time of day, and on any day of the year.\n\nChaat masala potatoes with coriander chutney and tamarind (pictured above)\n\nThis is inspired by aloo chaat, an Indian street food with many regional variations. Don\u2019t be put off by the long ingredient list \u2013 the whole thing comes together fairly easily, and you\u2019ll use the time the potatoes spend in the oven to make the chutney and the tamarind sauce.\n\nPrep 20 min\n\nCook 55 min\n\nServes 4 as a side\n\n750g baby new potatoes, cut lengthways into 1cm-thick slices\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n\n1 tsp chaat masala\n\n\u00bd tsp ground turmeric\n\n250g Greek-style yoghurt\n\n\u00bd small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced into rounds on a mandoline\n\n1 green chilli, thinly sliced, seeds and all\n\n1\u00bd tsp coriander seeds, toasted\n\n1\u00bd tsp nigella seeds, toasted\n\nMeera Sodha\u2019s recipe for vegan saag aloo | The New Vegan Read more\n\nFor the coriander chutney\n\n30g coriander leaves, roughly chopped\n\n1 green chilli, deseeded and roughly chopped\n\n1 tbsp lime juice\n\n60ml olive oil\n\nFor the sweet tamarind dressing\n\n1\u00bd tbsp shop-bought tamarind paste (I use Waitrose\u2019s Cook\u2019s Ingredient own-brand)\n\n1\u00bd tsp caster sugar\n\n\u00bc tsp chaat masala\n\nSalt\n\nHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/465F/gas 9. Put the potatoes and two teaspoons of salt in a medium saucepan, top with enough cold water to cover by about 4cm and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for six minutes, or until the potatoes are almost cooked through but still retain a bite, then drain and pat dry. Transfer to a large oven tray lined with baking paper and toss with the oil, chaat masala, turmeric, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then roast, stirring once or twice, for 35 minutes, or until deeply golden.\n\nMeanwhile, make the chutney by blitzing all the ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a small food processor. Make the dressing by whisking all the ingredients in a small bowl with a teaspoon and a half of water.\n\nSpread out the yoghurt on a large, round platter, top it with the chutney and swirl it through to create a ripple effect. Drizzle with half the tamarind dressing, then top with the potatoes, onion and chilli. Drizzle over the remaining dressing, sprinkle on the seeds and serve.\n\nPotato, leek and sauerkraut gratin\n\nSauerkraut brings a welcome acidity to a rich potato gratin. This is a relatively easy side dish, and it reheats well, too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Upper crust: Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s potato, leek and sauerkraut gratin.\n\nPrep 20 min\n\nCook 1 hr 50 min\n\nServes 6\n\n15g unsalted butter\n\n1 tbsp olive oil\n\n600g leeks (ie, about 3 large ones), trimmed, cut in half lengthways, then cut into 4cm lengths\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n1 tbsp thyme leaves, roughly chopped, plus 4 extra sprigs\n\n4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n\n200ml double cream\n\n200ml whole milk\n\n300g sauerkraut, store-bought or homemade\n\n20g chives, cut into 1\u00bdcm lengths\n\n1kg maris piper potatoes, peeled and cut into 1cm-thick rounds\n\n150g gruy\u00e8re, roughly grated\n\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put a large, ovenproof saute pan for which you have a lid on a medium-high heat, and add the butter and oil. Once hot, add the leeks, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks have softened and are just beginning to colour \u2013 about eight minutes. Add the chopped thyme and garlic, cook for two minutes more, until fragrant, then turn off the heat and leave to cool slightly, for 10-15 minutes. When the leeks have sat for 10 minutes, put the cream, milk and 200ml water in a small saucepan on a medium heat, bring to a gentle simmer, and keep warm on a low heat.\n\nStir the sauerkraut, chives, potatoes, half the cheese, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper into the cooled leeks, and smooth out the top so the potatoes are lying flat. Pour over the warm cream mixture, then sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and top with the thyme sprigs. Cover the pan, bake for 50 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for 30 minutes more, or until golden and bubbling. Leave to rest for about 15 minutes before serving directly from the pan.\n\nOven chips with cardamom mayonnaise\n\nTo my mind, nothing beats mayonnaise as a chip sauce. Here, I\u2019ve combined it with (optional) curry leaves and cardamom, and tossed the chips themselves in lime salt, so you end up with a potato experience that\u2019s rich, warm, sharp and creamy all at the same time. The mayonnaise will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks, so double the quantities and transform your next sandwich.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Grate idea: Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s oven chips topped with lime salt and served with a cardamom mayonnaise dip.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nInfuse 30 min\n\nCook 45 min\n\nServes 4 as a side\n\n14 cardamom pods, crushed, pods discarded and seeds blitzed in a spice grinder (or finely crushed in a mortar)\n\n165ml sunflower oil\n\n30 fresh curry leaves, 10 left whole, the rest blitzed in a spice grinder (or finely chopped) \u2013 optional\n\n1 egg yolk\n\n\u00bd small garlic clove, peeled and crushed\n\n4 limes \u2013 zest of 2-3 finely grated, to get 1\u00bd tbsp; juiced, to get 1 tbsp juice, and the rest cut into wedges, to serve\n\nFlaked sea salt\n\n1kg maris piper potatoes, skin on and cut into 1cm-thick chips\n\nPut the crushed cardamom seeds and blitzed curry leaves, if using, in a small saucepan and dry fry on a high heat for a minute, until fragrant. Add 120ml oil, heat for 30 seconds more, then add the whole curry leaves, if using, and gently fry until crisp \u2013 about a minute. Take the pan off the heat, lift out the whole curry leaves with a slotted spoon and set aside \u2013 you\u2019ll be using these as a garnish later. Leave the oil and remaining solids to infuse for 30 minutes, until completely cool, then set aside a tablespoon of the oil (along with some of the aromatics) and strain the rest into a jug; discard the solids left in the sieve.\n\nPut the egg yolk, garlic, half the lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked sea salt in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to combine. With the motor still running, start adding the cooled oil very slowly and in a very thin stream, until the mixture emulsifies and thickens into a mayonnaise.\n\nTransfer the mayonnaise to a small bowl then stir in the remaining teaspoon of lime juice, to thin it out a little. If the mayo splits (or gets too thick), whisk in a teaspoon of water until it emulsifies again (or loosens).\n\nHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. While the infused oil is cooling down, spread out the chips on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and toss with the remaining three tablespoons of oil and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Bake the chips for 20 minutes, then turn them over and bake for 15 minutes more, until they\u2019re cooked through and nicely golden brown.\n\nMix the lime zest with half a tablespoon of flaked sea salt, gently crushing it all together. Scatter the lime salt over the hot chips, toss to coat, then transfer to a platter. Drizzle over the mayonnaise and the reserved tablespoon of infused oil, top with the crisp curry leaves, if using, and serve hot with the lime wedges on the side.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
