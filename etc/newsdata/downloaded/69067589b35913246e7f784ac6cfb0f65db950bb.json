Jones\u2019s final message to his squad will be to urge them to emulate the triumphant class of 2003, with a reminder of the life-changing benefits that success can bring.\n\nJones\u2019s squad head to Tokyo on the back of a 37-0 victory over Italy on Friday and hopeful that knocks picked up by Joe Launchbury and Luke Cowan-Dickie are minor. While it was a clunky performance England\u2019s class eventually told and Jones quickly turned his attentions to finalising preparations in Japan before the opening match, against Tonga on Sunday 22 September.\n\nNeither Mako Vunipola nor Jack Nowell will be available for the game in Sapporo, with Jones revealing both will miss the first two fixtures with hamstring and ankle injuries respectively, but England still board the plane with optimism in abundance.\n\nThis is Jones\u2019s fourth World Cup campaign and he has tasted success before, having been a coaching consultant for the Springboks in 2007. Four years before that he was in charge of the Wallabies, who lost out to Sir Clive Woodward\u2019s England side in the final, but Jones is planning to rake up those painful memories to inspire his squad.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already spoken about [2003] and we may touch on it again,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThey can become someone who changes the whole course of history. The number of kids playing \u2026 the impact on their lives, they obviously get status benefits, they get financial benefits and they get their own personal happiness so it\u2019s pretty special. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity. They can make history.\u201d\n\nWeather permitting with a typhoon hitting Japan this weekend, England will arrive in Tokyo on Monday before heading south to a training base in Miyazaki for \u201cthree or four days of reconditioning\u201d. As disruptive as the extreme weather could be throughout the tournament, Jones revealed England have contingency plans in place if the typhoon affects their training plans, having organised indoor facilities with artificial turf.\n\n\u201cIt will affect the World Cup, there is no doubt about it,\u201d he added. \u201cYou just have to be able to ride with it, be adaptable and work out how you can escape with the situations that avail. You just can\u2019t go outside. Once the typhoon comes it\u2019s basically a lockdown. We have done a fair bit [of contingency planning]. We would have an idea of what we would do if there was a typhoon that stopped us training outside.\u201d\n\nJones, you sense, would not mind too much if England were affected by the elements. Throughout their summer preparation he has thrown a number of curveballs at his side, ranging from deliberately making the team bus late en route to Twickenham before facing Ireland, to arranging a double training session in the Treviso heat this week to place them under fatigue against Italy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got some way to go but I\u2019m really pleased with the way that they\u2019re tackling problems now,\u201d added Jones. \u201cGetting together and working it out. I think we\u2019re in a good position [to win the World Cup] but we\u2019ve got to keep improving. Preparation is still ongoing, it hasn\u2019t finished yet.\u201d\n\nJones has also been desperate to develop what he calls the \u201csocial cohesion\u201d of his squad, to improve players\u2019 relationships with each other. It explains why he wasted no time in discarding Ben Te\u2019o after his altercation with Mike Brown in Treviso and why, despite that, he is still encouraging his players to embrace social events. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a night in Tokyo,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThen we will fly out to Miyazaki and have three or four days or reconditioning and then start training next Saturday. We just want them to get them out and about.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s last overseas World Cup campaign \u2013 in New Zealand eight years ago \u2013 was plagued by off-field problems including the dwarf-throwing incident in Queenstown and Manu Tuilagi\u2019s ferry jump in Auckland. Ben Youngs is one four surviving members of the 2011 squad and recent headlines about his Leicester teammates being involved in a bar brawl on a pre-season trip in Portugal again highlighted the potential for off-field pitfalls. The scrum-half insisted however, that England will not be adopting monastic lifestyles. \u201cWe\u2019ve addressed the elephant in the room and spoken about how off-field stuff can bring unneeded attention that affects momentum,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes guys will get it wrong but in this group I think guys will look out for each other. We want to see Japan and have downtime. If guys want to have a drink, that\u2019s not a problem. The guys will police each other and make sure everyone makes the right decision.\u201d\n\nEngland in 2019\n\nW 2 Feb Ireland a 32-20 Six Nations\n\nW 10 Feb France h 44-8 Six Nations\n\nL 23 Feb Wales a 13-21 Six Nations\n\nW 9 Mar Italy h 57-14 Six Nations\n\nD 16 Mar Scotland h 38-38 Six Nations\n\nW 2 May Barbarians h 51-43 International\n\nW 11 Aug Wales h 33-19 WC warm up\n\nL 17 Aug Wales a 6-13 WC warm up\n\nW 24 Aug Ireland h 57-15 WC warm up\n\nW 6 Sept Italy h 37-0 WC warm up\n\nFirst RWC Pool C match\n\n22 Sept TongaSapporo 11.15am", "description": "Eddie Jones told England players that tournament victory will not only make history but earn them \u2018personal happiness\u2019 plus \u2018financial benefits\u2019", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6da49218509707b0c489cbc1819924e67816c601/0_95_1128_677/master/1128.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33f704798f946c84f4fccc379007ebb0", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
