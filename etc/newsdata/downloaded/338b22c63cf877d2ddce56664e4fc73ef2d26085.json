Despite the decline, researchers at Wealth-X predict the ranks of the global financial elite will grow to 353,550 by 2023, with a combined fortune of $43tn.\n\n\u201cAfter hitting the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 for global wealth creation in 2017, wealth preservation became the primary focus for many UHNW individuals in 2018,\u201d said the Wealth-X 2019 report published on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe late-year slump in equity markets meant that investors entered 2019 with some trepidation against a backdrop of slowing global growth and rising tensions in world trade.\n\n\u201cDevelopments over the first half of the year largely justified this sense of caution, with volatile asset markets, a deepening US-China trade war, rising Brexit-related threats and weaker global demand bringing about another challenging environment for wealth generation.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report said that over the long term, population growth, the rise of emerging-market economies, transformative digital technologies and the growing trend of consumers buying premium products will \u201ccontinue to provide opportunities for wealth creation\u201d.\n\nOnly 14.6% of UHNW people are women, but this is up from 13.7% a year earlier. \u201cWomen accounted for almost one in five of the global ultra wealthy class below the age of 50,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThis is an indication of shifting trends in global wealth distribution, changing cultural attitudes and the rising frequency of intergenerational wealth transfers, and reveals how technology is creating new opportunities for female entrepreneurs to create wealth.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nNew York regained its status as the city with the highest number of super-rich individuals, at 8,980, up 1.3%. In Hong Kong, which had held the top spot a year earlier, the number of ultra-rich residents fell 10.6% to 8,950.\n\nThe number of UHNW individuals in Hong Kong is expected to have fallen more sharply since then as the Wealth-X report covers 2018 \u2013 before widespread pro-democracy protests plunged the city\u2019s economy into crisis.\n\nThere were 22.8 million people worldwide with fortunes of more than $1m last year, an increase of 1.1% on 2017.", "description": "Economic woes fail to stop further 2,124 people becoming ultra-high net worth people", "authors": ["Rupert Neate"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad218897116881fe40522b8e2353f035e08885e5/0_229_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac2567529564f12825439f98e60c9c76", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
