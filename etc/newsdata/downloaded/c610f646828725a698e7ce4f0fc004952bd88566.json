(AP Photo/Hassan Ammar)\n\nBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Nationwide protests paralyzed Lebanon on Friday as demonstrators blocked major roads in a second day of rallies against the government's management of a severe economic crisis and proposed new taxes.\n\nThe protests were the largest since 2015, and could further destabilize a country with one of the highest debt loads in the world.\n\nThe protests could plunge Lebanon into a political crisis with unpredictable repercussions for the economy, which has been in steady decline. Some of the protesters said they would stay in the streets until the government resigns.\n\nSchools, banks and businesses shut down as the protests escalated and widened in scope to reach almost every city and province. Hundreds of people burned tires on highways and intersections in suburbs of the capital, Beirut, and in northern and southern cities, sending up clouds of black smoke in scattered protests. The road to Beirut's international airport was blocked.\n\n\"We are here today to ask for our rights. The country is corrupt, the garbage is all over the streets and we are fed up with all this,\" said Loris Obeid, a protester.\n\n\"We are here for the future of our kids. There's no future for us, no jobs at all and this is not acceptable any more. We have shut up for a long time and now it is time to talk,\" she added.\n\nThe demonstrations began Thursday evening and were sparked when the government announced plans for new taxes, including on such items as voice calls made through messaging applications, including Whatsapp.\n\nIn some cases the demonstrations evolved into riots, as protesters set fire to buildings and smashed window fronts, taking their anger out on politicians they accuse of corruption and decades of mismanagement.\n\nTwo Syrian workers died Thursday when they were trapped in a shop that was set on fire by rioters. Dozens of people were injured.\n\nSome protesters threw stones, shoes and water bottles at security forces and scuffled with police. Security forces said at least 60 of its members were injured in the clashes. Protesters were also injured.\n\nThe government is discussing the 2020 budget, and new taxes have been proposed, including on tobacco, gasoline and some social media communication software such as WhatsApp.\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri Hariri canceled a cabinet meeting scheduled for Friday to resume discussions. He was expected to address the nation later in the day.\n\nInterior Minister Raya al-Hassan insisted he would not resign, saying that could spark a national crisis more dangerous than the current economic crisis.\n\nYears of regional turmoil \u2014 worsened by an influx of 1.5 million Syrian refugees since 2011 \u2014 are catching up with the small Arab country. Lebanon has the third-highest debt level in the world, currently standing at about $86 billion, or 150% of its gross domestic product.\n\nInternational donors have been demanding that Lebanon implement economic changes in order to get loans and grants pledged at the CEDRE economic conference in Paris in April 2018. International donors pledged $11 billion for Lebanon but they sought to ensure the money is well spent in the corruption-plagued country.\n\nDespite tens of billions of dollars spent since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990, Lebanon still has crumbling infrastructure including daily electricity cuts, trash piles in the streets and often sporadic, limited water supplies from the state-owned water company.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fadi Tawil contributed reporting.", "description": "Nationwide protests paralyzed Lebanon on Friday as demonstrators blocked major roads in a second day of rallies against the government's management of a severe economic crisis and proposed new taxes.
