He explained:\n\nThere\u2019s a few things working in her favor. She took responsibility almost immediately. She was contrite, did not try to minimize her conduct. I think she handled it in a classy way. And so, at the end of the day, we thought the one-month was proportional.\n\nHuffman was ultimately given a 14-day sentence, which she is expected to start serving later this month.\n\n\u201cIf people take responsibility for their conduct and they take responsibility for their conduct early on, then it will probably go better for them,\u201d Lelling said.\n\nLoughlin and Giannulli have taken the opposite route, fighting allegations that they spent about $500,000 to get their two daughters into USC as members of the crew team despite neither actually participating in the sport.\n\nLelling indicated the larger dollar amount in the case would be a factor against Loughlin and Giannulli, but said cooperating now could still help them.\n\n\u201cThe longer a case goes \u2015 let\u2019s say if she goes through to trial \u2015 if it\u2019s after trial, I think certainly we\u2019d be asking for something substantially higher,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cIf she resolved her case short of trial, something a little lower than that.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Lelling has called the case the \u201clargest college admission scam ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\u201d So far, 15 parents \u2015 including Huffman \u2015 have pleaded guilty, while 19 others are fighting the charges.\n\n(H/T Law & Crime)\n\nLove HuffPost?
