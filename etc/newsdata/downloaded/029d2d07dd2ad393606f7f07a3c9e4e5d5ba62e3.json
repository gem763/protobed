Furthermore, to complete the first watch, they had to produce more than 800 components to yield the necessary 308 parts that met the brand\u2019s uncompromising standards.\n\nBecause the 43.5mm white gold piece is unique, Greubel Forsey has yet to set a price, but acknowledges that it will likely be well over $500,000. The brand plans to produce two or three pieces per year.\n\nThe roots of the Hand Made 1 stretch all the way back to Forsey\u2019s early days in London when he made his own parts to restore antique watches. Meanwhile, Robert Greubel started out making prototypes. Both had experience in taking raw pieces of metal and fashioning them into watch components using age-old methods.\n\nWhen they started working together, they recognized the potential of utilizing cutting-edge CNC technology that was sweeping the industry to focus on the exquisite hand-finishing skills for which they are revered.\n\n\u201cBy using CNC machines, or numerical control machines, to make raw components, we could do more on the hand finishing,\u201d Forsey says. \u201cAnd we could also develop the innovative side of Greubel Forsey, because we had a lot of mechanisms we wanted to develop.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing years, the partners lamented the loss of traditional watchmaking skills as automated machines increasingly took over from human hands. Their response was to found the Time Aeon Foundation in 2005 in partnership with independent watchmakers Philippe Dufour, Vianney Halter, and Kari Voutilainen.\n\nGreubel Forsey's Hand Made 1. Greubel Forsey\n\nWith a mission to preserve the ancient techniques that were becoming extinct, Time Aeon established the Naissance d\u2019une Montre (Birth of a Watch) project. They tapped Michel Boulanger, a watchmaking teacher in Paris, to build a tourbillon watch under the masters\u2019 tutelage entirely by hand with the help of historical manual machinery. He would then pass on his acquired knowledge and skills to future generations to keep them alive.\n\nThe project kicked off in 2009, and the prototype was unveiled in 2015 with 10 additional pieces planned and quickly reserved by collectors. In May 2016, the prototype watch sold at Christie\u2019s Hong Kong for US$1.46 million, raising funds for future Naissance d\u2019une Montre endeavors.\n\n\u201cWith Time Aeon Foundation, we hoped people would support at least training a minimum number of watchmakers and skill people each year with these traditional techniques,\u201d Forsey says, acknowledging the challenges involved that required Greubel Forsey to support the entire venture for six years.\n\n\u201cHowever, the project was a fantastic success because we saw the collectors were concerned about who was going to repair, restore, and overhaul their collections in the future, so there was a concern from the end customer about the skills.\u201d\n\nFor the Naissance d\u2019une Montre 2 project, Greubel and Forsey joined with Urwerk\u2019s Felix Baumgartner and Martin Frei to support the work of two promising young watchmakers: Dominique Buser and Cyrano Devanthey. The functioning prototype movement was unveiled at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in January. And for Naissance d\u2019une Montre 3, announced this year, Time Aeon partnered with Ferdinand Berthoud, a subsidiary brand of Chopard.\n\nAnother factor that paved the way for Hand Made 1 was the brand\u2019s efforts over the years to build a balance spring in house. \u201cThat\u2019s given us the experience in an excellent, central part of a handmade watch to be able to master those techniques ourselves,\u201d Forsey says.\n\nSuddenly, the Hand Made 1 seemed feasible.\n\n\u201cOf course, when you start to do that, you realize you are really attacking a mountain,\u201d he adds, as the process required his team to work differently. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take an existing movement and recreate that as handmade\u2026 We had to relook at how the watch, how each component could be made by hand with traditional-crafted techniques, and then redesign and reimagine each individual part to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile some parts were re-envisioned for simplification, the tourbillon was a mechanism that dictated an increased number of components to be accomplished by hand. As a result, it took 35 times longer to finish the tourbillon cage compared to a standard high-end tourbillon.\n\nNaturally, painstaking hand finishing was not overlooked. The unusual \u201cGratt\u00e9\u201d (scratched) finish on the main-plate, visible through the sapphire crystal case back, was particularly challenging with its random, etched checkerboard-like patterns lending modern flair.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to have a piece which is a contemporary context, because otherwise you are just trying to redo something that was done in the past,\u201d Forsey says. \u201cAnd yet, it\u2019s got a lot of codes and elements from very traditional watchmaking.\u201d", "description": "The timepiece required 6,000 hours and 308 original parts to complete", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120747/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
