I love a classic, bread-based crouton, but I see no need to limit the genre to one type of carbohydrate.\n\nPotato gems\u2014just like any good crouton\u2014are crunchy and crispy, but they\u2019re also pillowy on the inside, and those insides are made of potato. They\u2019re even easier to make than \u201cregular\u201d croutons, which were not exactly challenging to begin with. Just cook them according to the bag instructions, making sure that there is plenty of space between each tot so no one gets steamed. Line your baking pan with aluminium foil easy cleanup (and extra crisp bottoms).\n\nOnce the gems are piping hot and well browned, get them in a bowl and toss them with dried herbs, garlic powder, or\u2014if you are me or anything like me\u2014sour cream and onion popcorn seasoning. Anything you would flavour a crouton with works. Get them in a salad, and consume. Any salad benefits from the tot-ton, but a breakfast salad practically begs for it.", "description": "If you ware familiar with my oeuvre, you know that I have no qualms when it comes to replacing bread with potatoes.
