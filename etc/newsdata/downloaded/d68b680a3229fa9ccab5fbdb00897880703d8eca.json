Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY). \u201cHe\u2019s up to his neck in criminals and dirty money. Was he playing the President to get himself paid? Seems there\u2019s no honor among thieves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Giuliani\u2019s finances have been a component of House Democratic investigations into the pressure campaign that the former New York City mayor and President Trump applied to Ukrainian leadership in order to persuade them to investigate the work Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was doing in that country. But CNN reported that his financial dealings are under renewed scrutiny by investigators following the arrests of two clients, Soviet-born businessmen Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, on Thursday for campaign finance violations. And Maloney\u2019s comments suggest that there is an appetite for congressional investigators to better understand the money-trail as well.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast this week, Giuliani steadfastly denied that he was paid for any work he did in Ukraine, saying that he helped Trump on a \u201cpro bono\u201d basis. He said that the costs of his travel were covered by private clients for separate work that happened to correspond with his Ukraine portfolio. Speaking specifically about an August trip he made to Madrid to urge Andriy Yermak, a top Ukrainian official, to reinvestigate the Bidens, Giuliani said that he happened to be going to the Spanish capital already for \u201cbusiness and vacation.\u201d\n\nRudy\u2019s Ukraine Henchmen Made Big Donation to Pro-Trump PAC\n\n\u201cI have law clients and I have security clients in London and Madrid,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that particular trip has not been reimbursed but about three-fourths of it would be business and one-fourth would be personal. The Trump part would be considered personal because I don't get paid for representing the president.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also said that he never charged the State Department for the work he did to meet with and talk to Ukrainian officials, including Yermak.\n\n\u201cI've done work for the State Department before and I never charged them for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey call upon citizens all the time. I did it at least three times with [former Secretary of State] Colin Powell... I did this as a service to my government.\u201d\n\nThe extent of the work Giuliani did with and for the State Department has become a central component of the ongoing impeachment drama that has roiled the Trump administration. Text messages revealed during the course of congressional investigations showed that top officials at Foggy Bottom leaned on the former mayor to get a better sense of how newly-elected Ukrainian leadership was operating. But Giuliani also played a role in feeding State highly conspiratorial, and largely discredited information aboutUkraine supposedly playing a role in the launch of the special counsel probe into 2016 election meddling and Hunter Biden\u2019s post atop a natural gas company in that country.\n\nGiuliani Says Some of the Documents State Dept IG Handed to Congress Came From Him\n\nGiuliani\u2019s private clients also appear to have gotten preferential treatment from the president. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Trump pressed his then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to encourage the Department of Justice \u201cto drop a criminal case against an Iranian-Tukrish gold trader who was a client of Rudy Giuliani.\u201d And last week, the Associated Press reported that at the same time Giuliani was trying to persuade Ukrainian leaders to launch investigations, individuals with ties to the former mayor were \u201ctrying to install new management at the top of Ukraine\u2019s massive state gas company\u201d\u2014all while touting their connections to Trump and Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani called the AP article \u201ctotally false\u201d and a \u201cBiden-inspired hit job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven't done anything in Ukraine in two years. I have never done a deal in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven't even thought about a deal in Ukraine over the last two years.\u201d\n\nBut government ethicists and watchdogs have said that the opaqueness around Giuliani\u2019s finances does raise alarms about whether the president\u2019s lawyer is acting in a formal diplomatic capacity or as a conduit for private interests.", "description": "Drew Angerer/GettyA member of the House Intelligence Committee is calling on Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to disclose information on who financed his attempts to dig up dirt on Joe Biden amid a wave of reports that the work has dovetailed into official government business.\u00a0\u201cRudy needs", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/siXdJm4Fw1Yoblc3Xl5vjg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/17c504a0fb5272362e2e06b3c3bb138e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
