REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nThe plan, announced on Wednesday by Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, would remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves. Only tobacco-flavored products would be available.\n\nThe aim is to discourage vaping, especially by minors, after a handful of deaths and hundreds of lung illnesses have been linked to the practice. A majority of young vapers use only the flavored variety.\n\n\u201cHe would be doing me a favor,\u201d said Antoinette Quiles, a 31-year-old carpenter, as she inhaled from her Juul outside a New York subway stop. \u201cHopefully, if it\u2019s not available, I won\u2019t buy it. I\u2019ve tried to stop and put it away, but it\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with a dozen New Yorkers who said they regularly vaped, no one expressed dismay that the government might crack down on the widely preferred flavored pods.\n\nLawmakers, public-health advocates and parents have urged the federal government to step in to restrict e-cigarettes, introduced more than a decade ago as an alternative for cigarette-addicted adults. But vaping has exploded in popularity among young people.\n\nThe proposal followed recent flavor bans by state and local governments. Earlier this week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed to ban flavors of e-cigarettes throughout the state, following Michigan, which imposed a ban last week. San Francisco took the ban one step further, banning the sale of all e-cigarettes.\n\nPreliminary data show more than a quarter of U.S. high school students used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days, an increase of 20.8% from last year, the Health and Human Services Department said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine if they think that\u2019s going to be a deterrent for young kids that aren\u2019t of age to buy them,\u201d said Nick Agosti, a 31-year-old assistant community school director, adding he would miss the flavors. \u201cIt\u2019s something that needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S E-CIGARETTES THEMSELVES\u2019\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March formally proposed guidelines that would prohibit the sale of flavored e-cigarette products, except mint and menthol, in traditional retail outlets. Under that proposal, which had not been finalized, e-cigarette makers could still sell flavored products online and in age-restricted stores, such as vape shops.\n\nWednesday\u2019s proposal went further, banning the sale of all flavored e-cigarette products across all retail channels, aside from tobacco-flavored products. It would include mint and menthol flavoring as well as bubblegum, candy, fruit, alcohol and other flavors.\n\nSome self-described vape addicts said the flavor ban would still be insufficient to crack down on the epidemic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the flavors that are the reason why people are dying, it\u2019s the e-cigarettes themselves,\u201d said Bush George, a 44-year-old stylist who said he vapes in addition to smoking cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re still online, then I\u2019ll find a way to purchase it. There\u2019s ways to do a lot of things, get your hands on anything if you know how to do it correctly,\u201d said Stephen Figueroa, 25, as he took a hit from his vape against his better judgment.", "description": "New Yorkers who vape do not seem to mind if President Donald Trump pushes through a proposed ban on flavored e-cigarettes, admitting that widespread youth addiction needed to be controlled and expressing hope that it might help them quit.", "authors": ["Gabriella Borter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428850256&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1X1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
