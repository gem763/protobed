Plus at times it\u2019s very funny.\n\nAfter several years making less than stellar movies, there's a sense of De Niro and Pacino rousing themselves for one last majestic effort to consolidate immortality as the greatest screen actors of their generation.\n\nBeing a student as well as a scholar of filmmaking, Scorsese continues to experiment with technology, and the deep pockets of Netflix has allowed him to extensively use state-of-the-art CGI to make his stars look decades younger in certain scenes.\n\nThis pays off by maintaing the integrity and strength of the performances, which include a career best turn by Joe Pesci, and a small role for Scorsese regular Harvey Keitel.\n\nUnusually for Scorsese movies the women exist in the margins, with Anna Paquin acting as a silent witness to events and as a proxy conscience of the audience.\n\n(Image: NETFLIX)\n\nPlus we see Brit actor Stephen Graham alongside Ray Romano in supporting roles, and Jack Huston playing assassinated US politician, Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nBased on the 2004 memoir, 'I Heard You Paint Houses', by former investigator Charles Brandt, this is in tone, length and quality a companion piece to and no less of a masterpiece than Sergio Leone's 1984 mob epic, Once Upon a Time in America, but with greater colour and energy.\n\nThat film also starred De Niro in a role in which he needed to be aged, though at a time when he needed traditional techniques to age him upwards.\n\n(Image: Netflix)\n\nThere are few actor/director partnerships whose careers and reputations have influenced each other to such an extent as De Niro and Scorsese, and if this is to be capstone for their remarkably long-lived professional relationship, then it's a more than fitting monument to their work.\n\nThree times Oscar-winner editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, has worked with Scorsese for over 50 years, has edited all of his films since 1980's Raging Bull and is unequalled in mastery of her craft.\n\nCrucial to holding our attention during the daunting running time she controls the tempo, generates tension and heightens the drama, especially in the key later stretch of this marathon watch.\n\n(Image: Netflix)\n\nAnother returning collaborator is scriptwriter Steve Zaillian, who earned an Oscar nomination for Scorsese's 2002 Gangs of New York, and provides plenty of meaty dialogue for the actor's to chew on, as well as being fluent in the coded criminal language of threats and favours.\n\nPlus there\u2019s cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, who shot Scorsese's last two films, the brilliantly unhinged The Wolf of Wall Street, and the masterful religious period drama Silence, and here he turns Scorsese\u2019s love of classic cars and clothes into a fetish.\n\nScorsese has made fewer gangster films than his reputation suggests, and this could easily have been a safe and nostalgic return to his old stomping ground - but he retains a remarkable fire for storytelling and the talent and vision to craft an exemplary piece of work.\n\n(Image: NETFLIX)\n\nNot only does he reference his previous work such as Goodfellas, but also daringly offer a commentary on Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Godfather.\n\nThe Irishman confirms the blistering creative hot streak the 76 year old director has been on since finally winning the best director Oscar for 2006's The Departed.\n\nThe big question surrounding not how many Oscar nominations The Irishman will garner, but how many wins.", "description": "If there's one question remaining about the quality of Martin Scorsese's mafia drama, it's how many Oscars it'll win", "authors": ["Chris Hunneysett", "Image", "Netflix", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572079.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Film-review-please-do-in-opinion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
