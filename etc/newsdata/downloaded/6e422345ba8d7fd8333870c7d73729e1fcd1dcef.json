Joseph F. Dunford Jr. said Monday as the Pentagon formally relaunched the United States Space Command.\n\nPresident Trump has made an enhanced U.S. military mission in space a central part of his defense strategy. In a televised ceremony from Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, Gen. Dunford said the Chinese and Russian governments \u201chave seen how we leverage space\u201d and have in turn developed anti-satellite missiles, jamming cyberspace capabilities, and directed energy weapons to counter U.S. assets.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say that we\u2019re at another Sputnik moment,\u201d the general said. \u201cYou could argue that the stakes are much higher than they were in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\u201d\n\nTop Pentagon officials have repeatedly stated that Washington\u2019s defense doctrine to maintain overwhelming military superiority in space is now null and void, in the face of the growing challenge posed by Moscow and Beijing.\n\nGen. Dunford \u2014 who has served as chairman since 2015 and is set to retire later this month \u2014 added that both Iran and North Korea are aspiring powers in space.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer take our access to space for granted,\u201d Gen. Dunford said. \u201cSpace is a contested domain.\u201d\n\nThe White House last month formally reinstituted the command, 16 years after it was folded into the Strategic Command as part of a military reorganization following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe new U.S. Space Command \u2014 housed in Colorado Springs \u2014 will serve as a unified hub that will coordinate all aspects of Pentagon space policy, now spread across various agencies and departments of the military.\n\nThe command is now on par with organizations like U.S. Central Command and U.S. Cyber Command, and marks a key step in the process of standing up Mr. Trump\u2019s planned Space Force, which in time could become the sixth branch of the armed forces on a par with the Army, Navy and Air Force.\n\nGen. John Raymond, the recently confirmed commander of U.S. SPACECOM, said at Monday\u2019s unveiling that his new assignment \u201cis a different command built for a different time \u2014 built to compete, deter and win in an extremely complex and quickly evolving strategic environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough space is clearly our war-fighting domain, we do not want to fight a fight that extends into space,\u201d Gen. Raymond added.\n\nWhile several lawmakers have argued that revamping U.S. Space Command is an important first step in defending and protecting space assets, others have expressed concerns over how the command will work with existing space operations handled by the Air Force and the intelligence community.\n\nLawmakers returned to Washington on Monday after a five-week summer recess and will continue negotiations for the fiscal year 2020 defense policy bill that is expected to include amendments that lay the groundwork for a future Space Force or Corps.\n\nThe House and Senate have separately passed legislation that would establish a larger military department dedicated to space and are negotiating language to fund and regulate a potential sixth branch in the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act. But disputes remain between the Democrat-held House and the Republican-controlled Senate about the force\u2019s title and jurisdiction.\n\nA new military branch requires congressional approval, and the idea remains caught in legislative limbo on Capitol Hill. Still, Pentagon officials say U.S. Space Command can and will be organized relatively quickly and easily.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
