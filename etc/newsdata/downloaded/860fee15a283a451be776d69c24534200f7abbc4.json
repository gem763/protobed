Far from their usual perfection. At times a little rough around the edges, crinkled even. But at its core was the same clinical brilliance, the same unshakeable self-belief, the same moments of magic that have come to set them apart from their rivals. Because when the pressure is on, the All Blacks will always find a way to win. That\u2019s exactly what they did here in Yokohama, securing a 23-13 victory over their fiercest of rivals.\n\nThat there were even question marks over who would emerge victorious from this clash alluded to the recent swings in momentum of these two sides. Whereas South Africa have picked themselves up from the lows of 2016, which saw them humiliated at the hands of the Italians, the All Blacks headed into this tournament with their usual aura of invincibility looking somewhat faded. With Steve Hansen placing his faith in the Richie Mo\u2019unga-Beauden Barrett tandem, which had underwhelmed against the Springboks in the summer\u2019s 16-16 draw, New Zealand were under the spotlight.\n\nFor the opening 25 minutes at least, it proved almost blinding. South Africa were by far the better of the two teams as they kept the All Blacks at bay with their rush defence and asked probing question in attack. They were slicker with the ball in hand, more assured in their running. Their hits were harder and more impactful as New Zealand struggled to find their feet at International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The flow of this match swung rapidly in the All Blacks\u2019 direction as they landed a quick-fire two-try punch, courtesy of George bridge and Scott Barrett, to seize control. This is what New Zealand do. This is what they\u2019re capable of: a thumping great smack across the cheeks, with 14 points to boot.\n\nFor both scores, South Africa will rue their careless mistakes. On the first, a spilled ball from Duane Vermuelen was followed by a Mo\u2019unga cross-field kick to Sevu Reece, the wing burning off Makazole Mapimpi on the break before feeding Ardie Savea.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

An accompanying Beauden was on hand to finish under the posts.\n\nIn the space of three minutes, it was New Zealand who were now in the ascent.\n\nSouth Africa nonetheless showed their mettle in refusing to roll over, fighting back through a Pieter-Steph du Toit try seven minutes after the break. A lapse in concentration from the champions allowed the unchallenged forward to pick up possession from a ruck on the five-metre line. It was a costly mistake that threatened to undo all their hard work.\n\nWith the score briefly poised at 17-13, New Zealand channelled their trademark composure to stem the flow of green shirts bearing down in the minutes that followed. Hansen\u2019s men bedded in, slowed the match down and took the sting out of their opponents\u2019 attack.\n\nTwo second-half penalties from the boot of Mo\u2019unga made sure of the win, though the electric Cheslin Kolbe kept the reigning champions on their toes with two piercing runs down the right flank \u2013 both of which looked sure to end in a try, only to fall short.\n\nThis result means the All Blacks have still never lost a pool stage game, winning all 29 such fixtures. More importantly, it underlined why they are the favourites to lift the Webb Ellis Cup come November.", "description": "It was, in so many ways, the sort of performance we\u2019ve come to expect from this New Zealand\u00a0side of late.
