Elizabeth Warren has turned a corner in the presidential race, emerging as not just a maven of policy plans but also someone with whom Democratic voters would like to crack open a beer.\n\nHer rising likability among Democrats has cemented her status as a top challenger to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the early front-runner for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nA new poll confirmed the friendly factor buoying Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign, with Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters saying they view the Massachusetts senator more favorably than any of her rivals.\n\nShe enjoyed a favorability rating of 75%, besting Mr. Biden at 71% and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont at 66%, according to the NPR/PBS/Marist poll.\n\nThe spike in favorability is a startling change for Ms. Warren, who was mocked as inauthentic when she opened a beer on Instagram this year and was described in a January profile in Vanity Fair magazine as coming across on Capitol Hill as \u201cholier than thou,\u201d \u201caloof\u201d and having a \u201cmoralizing\u201d tone.\n\nThe warm and fuzzy feelings about Ms. Warren do not extend to Republican voters, however. Many of them revel in President Trump calling her \u201cPocahontas\u201d to mock her falsely claiming Native American heritage early in her career as a lawyer and college professor.\n\nStill, her newfound likability with Democrats helped her broaden her appeal beyond far-left ideologues to millennials, suburban women and former Hillary Clinton supporters.\n\nIt seems the more voters get to know Ms. Warren and her message the more they like her, said Vikki Brown, chairwoman of the Democratic Party in Black Hawk County, Iowa.\n\n\u201cI have had conversations with Elizabeth Warren, and it is like talking to your neighbor,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cShe is very accessible.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren appears to have solidified herself as the \u201cselfie\u201d queen on the campaign trail, where she has earned a reputation for closing out her events by snapping photos with the hordes of voters who turn out to see her.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s allies appear to be taking note.\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, in a Washington Post op-ed, called Ms. Warren a \u201chypocrite\u201d for eschewing big-ticket fundraisers, while relying on more than $10 million from her U.S. Senate reelection campaign that came from larger donors.\n\nIn the poll, Ms. Warren also was among the least unfavorable. She tied Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, who is known for his \u201cnice guy\u201d image, for the lowest unfavorable rating of 11%.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s unfavorable rating was 22% and Mr. Sanders\u2019 unfavorable rating was 27%.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s net favorability \u2014 calculated by subtracting unfavorable from favorable scores \u2014 was the highest at 64%.\n\nBy comparison, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who relishes her reputation for being \u201cMinnesota nice,\u201d scored a net favorability rating of 18%, with an 18% unfavorable score.\n\nThe bad news for Ms. Warren and the rest of the Democratic hopefuls is their likability does not bridge the country\u2019s political divide.\n\nAmericans overall split on both Ms. Warren (40% favorable to 40% unfavorable) and Mr. Biden (44% favorable to 45% unfavorable). Mr. Sanders and Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, who round out the top four candidates, had favorable scores that are upside down nationally, according to the pollsters.\n\n\u201cThe best-known Democrats may be viewed well among their party faithful, but have a long way to go to connect with the national electorate,\u201d said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. \u201cWhen Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are added to the mix, they each end up with high negatives.\u201d\n\nEven as she charms the Democratic base, the potential downside of the Warren bid was evident here in Texas.\n\nLook no further than the Greenpeace activists who dangled on ropes beneath a bridge to block oil freighter traffic in the Houston Shipping Channel the day of the debate.\n\nThe stunt exposed the tension between the Democratic candidates, including Ms. Warren, who back a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d environmentalist makeover of the U.S. economy and Houston, the energy industry hub hosting their debate.\n\nMark P. Jones, a political science professor at nearby Rice University, said Ms. Warren and other far-left candidates could struggle to win over voters by attacking the fossil fuel industry and vowing to move the nation to 100 percent clean energy over 10 years.\n\n\u201cIf there is one state that would be really hurt by the Green New Deal, it would be the Lone Star State,\u201d Mr. Jones said.\n\nMr. Jones said down-ticket candidates, including Houston-area Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, may have to distance themselves from the party\u2019s next presidential nominee on energy issues because so many people directly or indirectly benefit from the energy industry.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand we have a Democratic Party that is going all-in on the Green New Deal, and yet they are holding a debate in the fossil fuel capital of the world, but the audience is a national audience and they will be focused on talking points on ending the fossil fuel industry and the only debate is whether it is five, 10 or 15 years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican Party seized on the awkward setting the Democrats chose.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to Democrats explaining how they intend to compete in Texas while running on their socialist Green New Deal agenda of banning hamburgers and oil,\u201d said Bob Salera, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm for House Republicans. \u201cThese folks are truly delusional.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign deployed an airplane pulling a 4,800-square-foot banner that warned Houstonians that the Democrats\u2019 \u201csocialism\u201d-fueled policies plans would hurt the nation.\n\nThe banner said: \u201cSOCIALISM WILL KILL HOUSTON\u2018S ECONOMY! VOTE TRUMP 2020\u201d and \u201cTEXT \u2018USA\u2019 TO 8802.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign also ran full-page ads in the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News highlighting how some of the Democratic contenders have called for the elimination of private insurance, higher taxes and the \u201cabolishment of the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single Democrat candidate has job-killing, economy-crushing policies that won\u2019t work for America,\u201d said Erin Perrine, Trump campaign deputy communications director. \u201cTeam Trump is here to remind them and let everyone in Houston know what a complete disaster Democrats are for America.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Seth McLaughlin reported from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
