Tuesday\u2019s power cuts marked the third wave of mass blackouts implemented this month by PG&E.\n\nUtilities serving Southern California\u2019s more highly urbanized areas have imposed smaller-scale outages.\n\nAnnouncing preliminary findings of its Getty fire investigation, the Los Angeles Fire Department said the blaze probably started when a tree branch snapped off in high winds landed on adjacent power lines, producing sparks and \u201carcing\u201d that ignited nearby brush.\n\nThe lines, which are operated by the city\u2019s Department of Water and Power (DWP), remained intact, the statement said.\n\nThe DWP said the broken branch apparently came from a Eucalyptus tree growing about 30 feet away, beyond the vegetation-clearance zone required by state regulations.\n\nPG&E has likewise been implicated in the latest Sonoma County blaze, dubbed the Kincade fire. The utility acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire broke out near a damaged PG&E transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.\n\nThe company, whose mass power shutdowns have drawn harsh criticism from the governor, filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.\n\nCiting progress made against the Kincade fire, Newsom said the number of evacuees in northern California had diminished from 190,000 at the peak of that blaze to 130,000 on Tuesday.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nProperty losses from the Kincade, listed at 15% contained, were put at 189 homes and other structures, double Monday\u2019s tally.\n\nThe size of the Getty fire\u2019s evacuation zone was reduced by roughly 3,000 homes on Tuesday, but residents of about 7,000 dwellings remained displaced, fire officials said. At least a dozen homes have been destroyed so far.", "description": "Firefighters braced late on Tuesday for a resurgence of strong Santa Ana desert winds across Southern California after a day of light breezes helped them gain ground against a blaze displacing thousands of Los Angeles residents near the famed Getty Center museum.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446407424&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T07F", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
