To fully repent, I must make clear what I now know to be the truth: Phone calls are good, actually.\n\nOne of the best arguments in favor of phone calls will be obvious to anyone who\u2019s ever gone back and forth for three days via email trying to pick a spot for Tuesday\u2019s happy hour. Guhan Subramanian, the director of the Harvard Program on Negotiation, which teaches business- and law-school students the finer points of conflict resolution, argues that spoken conversation accomplishes far more in a shorter amount of time. In any discussion, \u201cpeople are asking questions, probing, asking follow-up questions,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a lot easier to do when you\u2019re over the phone or in person, compared to by email or text.\u201d\n\nThis difference is what first pushed me back to phone calls. I wanted to hear my editor\u2019s reactions to my story ideas and work them out in real time, not watch a \u201cPaul is typing \u2026\u201d graphic linger ominously for 30 seconds before I knew the verdict. (Hi, Paul.) With friends, too, I wanted to rekindle the energy of live conversation. I wanted to crack a joke and hear someone laugh. I wanted my thumbs to have the occasional night off.\n\nWith so many digital avenues now available for reaching someone, the problem with phone calls is not that they\u2019re inconvenient. It\u2019s that they\u2019re gauche. Especially for young people who tend to use their phones constantly, text messaging has become a roiling conversation that never really begins or ends. There\u2019s often just as strong an expectation of an immediate answer to a text as there has traditionally been to a phone call\u2014a phenomenon probably familiar to you if your significant other has ever fussed at you for tweeting or posting to Instagram Stories while you\u2019ve left him or her on read. A phone call might still carry a more explicit demand for attention, but it\u2019s actually far easier to explain being unable to answer a call than a text.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating a wholesale rejection of texting in favor of speaking. There are plenty of situations in which a text or email is plainly preferable, and for people with hearing impairments or other disabilities that make phone calls difficult, the development of real-time, text-based communication is a boon that shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. For other people, a sense of anxiety can come from the on-the-spot nature of phone calls. Text communication allows anywhere from a moment to several days of self-editing.\n\nBut that itself can come with some drawbacks, according to Subramanian. \u201cOver email, the message that\u2019s received may not be the same as the message that\u2019s sent,\u201d he says. It\u2019s missing the back-and-forth contextualization and clearer tone that spoken conversation provides.", "description": "It\u2019s time to start calling your friends again.", "authors": ["Amanda Mull"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_142165131/facebook.jpg?1568656186", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
