Perhaps the opportunity will arise, but it hasn't arisen yet, where I'll be asked to do something and I'll do it.\n\nI almost did it for the Parkinson's Society in the Albert Hall. I said yes, and then I changed my mind.'\n\nThe popular funnyman said part of the issue was his reluctance to be defined by his condition.\n\nBilly Connolly performing 'The South Bank Show' in May 1979. The comedian is currently retired from performing\n\nHe told the newspaper: 'I refuse to let it represent me, that I have Parkinson's. I'm a lot of things as well as that.\n\n'I went to a Parkinson's Society lunch in Florida [where he moved last year for the climate, at the insistence of Stephenson, turning his back on New York, his long-time home, and its winters] and it was all people shaking and f******* about.\n\n'I thought, God, I'm going to be like that. This isn't healthy. I don't find it healthy to swim in Parkinson's.'\n\nHe added that Parkinson's - which is a progressive neurological condition - is the 'first thing I think about when I wake up.\n\n'And then you can't get out of bed. You have to get your wife to pull you out. But some mornings, I think about it the second - they're good days.\n\n'And you always manage to get out of bed yourself. And you draw better [since 2012 he has published four collections of his drawings]. And get about your life better.'\n\nAnother concern Sir Billy has about returning to live performance is recognition that his mind 'works differently.'\n\nHe told the BBC: 'I may do another gig, I don't know, I haven't cancelled that idea. But not right now, I'm not ready.\n\n'I feel different, my mind works differently. I don't know if I can do it with my mind in the state that it's in.\n\n'And I drool. This is a recent one. It's another gorgeous side of Parkinson's disease. There's a little surprise every month.'", "description": "Billy Connolly, 76, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2013 and announced his retirement from live performing five years later.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/14/19656202-0-image-a-49_1570974612164.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
