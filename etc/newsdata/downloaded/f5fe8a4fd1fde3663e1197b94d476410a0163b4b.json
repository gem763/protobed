Sam says: \u2018We all know that it\u2019s vital to chill your bottle of bubbly before serving, but if you don\u2018t have the luxury of a completely empty fridge, getting your Methuselah cool can be a little trickier than your average bottle.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d recommend chilling your Methuselah in a large bucket filled with ice, or leaving it outside if it\u2019s nice and cold, to get that lovely cool fizz.\u2019\n\nThis is one big bottle (Picture: Aldi)\n\nNext, pop the cork to open the bottle.\n\nSam adds: \u2018Whether it\u2019s a normal size bottle or a Methuselah \u2013 it\u2019s important that you open the bottle safely to avoid any flying corks.\n\n\u2018For this larger bottle, I\u2019d say this is definitely a two-man job, so grab a pal.\n\n\u2018First remove the muzzle \u2013 but make sure you keep hold of the cork at all times (this is the key to avoiding any accidents)\n\n\u2018Now its time for a little help from your friends \u2013 one of you needs to hold the base of the bottle while the other looks after the neck\n\n\u2018Pointing away from the party of people, twist the bottle (and not the cork) until the cork gently loosens.\u2019\n\nSam says that pouring the bottle needs more than one pair of hands too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018You need one holding the base and one holding the neck.\n\n\u2018The main thing is to take it slow to avoid any spills and wastage. Some people like to pour their Methuselah into decanters \u2013 but personally I think that takes a bit of the fun (and froth) out of it!\u2019\n\nAnd then all you need to do is sit back and enjoy.\n\nMORE: Wetherspoons is first pub chain to install \u2018not every disability is visible\u2019 signs after student\u2019s complaint\n\nMORE: There\u2019s a bank that gives out ice cream with an ATM that dispenses free toppings\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Aldi is selling a giant six-litre bottle of prosecco - the equivalent of eight bottles.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91914199_1571934182.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
