Amen. 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\n\nBecause of this, \"her post made R\u00e4s\u00e4nen the subject of a pretrial investigation by the Finnish Police for a suspected incitement against sexual and gender minorities.\"\n\nR\u00e4s\u00e4nen stated in August, \"I am not concerned on my part, as I trust this will not move on to the prosecutor. However, I am concerned if quoting the Bible is considered even \u2018slightly\u2019 illegal. I hope this won't lead to self-censorship among Christians. Rom. 1:24\u201327.\"\n\nFinnish police confirmed to local media that \"The pre-trial investigations have not yet been completed. Police will provide more details once the investigations have been completed or presented to a prosecutor for consideration of charges.\"\n\nIncreasingly, it seems as if the rights to freedom of religion and freedom of speech around the world are being trampled upon in the name of tolerance. As Mike Gonzalez of the Heritage Foundation pondered, \"Is this the future we want?\"", "description": "\"I am concerned if quoting the Bible is considered even slightly illegal.
