It was good to test myself. Things are looking good and I\u2019m happy with the win.\n\n\u201cTokyo is definitely on the cards - as an athlete you always want to represent your country. You just have to take it one year at a time. Hopefully, come Tokyo time, we will be in the mix.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s course record was beaten by Kenyan Brigid Kosgei, who finished with a time of 1:04:28, five months after winning the London Marathon.", "description": "Britain's Mo Farah won a record sixth successive Great North Run after setting his personal best time on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427669794&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870W1-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
