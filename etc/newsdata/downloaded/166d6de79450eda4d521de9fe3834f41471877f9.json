This recipe was carried by my great grandfather in the 1940s when he set sail for Uganda with his big ambitions and his sev sancha (a little machine that\u2019s used to make chickpea flour noodles).\n\nThe recipe travelled again decades later, in 1972, with my grandparents when they left Uganda for Britain. It was passed on to me by my mother last year, and now it\u2019s yours for safekeeping.\n\nThe recipe has stayed the same; it\u2019s only the cook and the times that have changed.\n\nGujarati tomato and sev curry\n\nYou might think that tomatoes are out of season, but the Isle of Wight\u2019s Tomato Stall still supplies much of the UK for another few weeks yet.\n\nThe sev \u2013 super-thin, fried chickpea noodles often called \u201cnylon\u201d sev \u2013 can easily be bought here in the UK: try the world food or ethnic aisles at bigger supermarkets, your local Indian grocer or online.\n\nEat this with another vegetable curry (such as my potato and spinach curry), rice and/or chapatis.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 15 min\n\nServes 4 as part of a main meal\n\n3 tbsp rapeseed oil\n\n\u00be tsp mustard seeds\n\n1 big pinch fenugreek seeds\n\n5 fat garlic cloves, peeled and minced\n\n1kg mixed tomatoes, quartered\n\nSalt\n\n1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder\n\n1 tsp ground coriander\n\n\u00be tsp ground cumin\n\n\u00bd tsp ground turmeric\n\n1 tbsp tomato puree\n\n30-50g nylon sev\n\nFresh coriander, shredded, to serve\n\nIn a large frying pan for which you have a lid, heat the oil over a medium heat until it\u2019s shimmering hot. Add the mustard and fenugreek seeds, leave them to pop for a minute, then add the minced garlic. Stir until the garlic is golden and getting sticky in the pan \u2013 this will take a minute, possibly two \u2013 then add the tomatoes and a big pinch of salt. Stir to combine, then cover the pan and leave everything to cook on a high heat for five minutes \u2013 it should be bubbling fiercely. Add the chilli, ground coriander, cumin, turmeric, tomato puree and a couple of tablespoons of water, if need be to loosen the mixture, cover again and cook for a further two minutes.\n\nTaste and adjust the salt or chilli, if you wish, then distribute the curry across four bowls and add a small handful of sev and a sprinkle of coriander to each. Serve as part of a meal with freshly steamed basmati rice and/or chapatis.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
