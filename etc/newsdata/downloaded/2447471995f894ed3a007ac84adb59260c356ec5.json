I\u2019m confident we will not start one, but I\u2019m confident that whoever starts one will not be the one who finishes it.\u201d\n\nAsked by host Margaret Brennan what that meant, Zarif replied: \u201cThat means there won\u2019t be a limited war.\u201d\n\nThe US and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly accused Iran of being behind the 14 September attacks on Saudi oilfields, which were claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and currently fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen\u2019s civil war.\n\nZarif, who is in New York for the United Nations general assembly, said he was confident Iran played no role in the attack, and described the US decision to send troops to bolster Saudi air defences as unhelpful posturing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A satellite image of the aftermath of the 14 September attack on Saudi Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq oil processing facility.

But it didn\u2019t take place from Iran.\u201d\n\nThe interview came after the head of the Republican Guards, Maj Gen Hossein Salami, said on Iranian TV on Saturday: \u201cBe careful, a limited aggression will not remain limited. We will pursue any aggressor. We are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defences. Trump\u2019s move drew fire in Washington on Saturday from House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it his \u201clatest outrageous attempt\u201d to circumvent Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s week of dithering over Iran makes America look weak and foolish Read more\n\n\u201cThese unacceptable actions are cause for alarm,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement accusing Trump of turning \u201ca blind eye\u201d to Saudi violence against innocent Yemenis, human rights abuses and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cThe United States cannot enable more brutality and bloodshed,\u201d she added. \u201cCongress will do our job to uphold the constitution, defend our national security and protect the American people.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami speaks at Tehran\u2019s Islamic Revolution and Holy Defence museum.

When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 has failed,\u201d Zarif told state television.\n\n\u201cBut this is dangerous and unacceptable as an attempt at blocking ... the Iranian people\u2019s access to food and medicine.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi rejected what he called \u201cunreal and repetitious accusations by certain Saudi officials\u201d about the attacks, state media said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif.
