Ten survivors have been found along with an unidentified body.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult situation; there are parts (of the building) that can still collapse,\u201d said Bezerra, who led the rescue operation.\n\nAuthorities in the city of 2.6 million inhabitants in Brazil\u2019s northeast said two trapped people were communicating with relatives and rescuers by phone. Rescuers urged people at the site to be silent to allow them to hear noises in the rubble.\n\n\u201cFor now we are trying to hear sounds that indicate where people are. There are several layers of debris,\u201d said fire department spokesman Romario Fernandes. He said the rescue operation is expected to last days.\n\nWitnesses said they saw people in the building shortly before it collapsed.\n\nDaiane Moreira was working next to the building when it collapsed.\n\n\u201cI just heard a boom and the building came down at once. A man came out drenched in blood and with a broken arm; he was the only one we could help,\u201d Moreira told journalists at the scene, as relatives and friends of building residents wept and waited for information.\n\nFrancineudo Rodrigues criticized the maintenance of the building where his father Francisco has worked as a doorman for eight years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen cracks in columns; I\u2019ve seen many problems that were not solved since I started coming here,\u201d Rodrigues told journalists.\n\nRodrigues, who also does jobs at the building, said his father is alive at a local hospital.\n\n\u201cNothing ever changed in this building. It is the same as what I saw when my father started working here,\u201d he said.\n\nFortaleza Mayor Roberto Claudio said it was not immediately clear what caused the building to collapse. He promised a \u201crigorous investigation.\u201d\n\nAndre Montenegro, the head of construction industry chamber in the state of Ceara, believes Tuesday\u2019s collapse happened \u201cin a 30-year-old building that was clearly having problems with its maintenance, with its foundations.\u201d\n\nMontenegro also said the crisis in Brazil\u2019s economy is preventing many owners of old buildings from investing in their renovation.\n\n\u201cA lot of investments in maintenance are being postponed for a later date, and sometimes that later date comes too late,\u201d he said.\n\nThe building is located in central Fortaleza about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the Iracema beach, one of the city\u2019s top tourist spots.\n\nTuesday\u2019s incident adds to a recent list of buildings collapsing in Brazil.\n\nAnother building partially gave way in Fortaleza in June. No one was injured, but the incident forced 16 families to move out.\n\nIn April, two four-story buildings collapsed in Rio de Janeiro, killing 24 people. The accident took place in a hillside area that was hard hit by rains and flash floods.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A seven-story building collapsed Tuesday in an upscale part of the Brazilian city of Fortaleza, killing one person and leaving others trapped with some communicating with family members by cellphone from under debris, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mauricio Savarese"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/brazil_building_collapse_80129_c0-84-4000-2417_s1200x700.jpg?fbe7ef442a2f9a5ed4866a4e9a7e44be6246bc40", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
