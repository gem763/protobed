Pick a long-sleeved top and full-length trousers \u2013 both should hug your body and offer good stretch, with no restriction anywhere, but still feel snug enough around the waistband, neck and sleeves to trap warmth in.\n\nLook for some stretch to the material, and a wide, comfortable waistband on bottoms.\n\nThermal tops usually have a crew neck or a high, zipped neck \u2013 the latter can double up as a handy neck warmer.\n\nYou may see base layers listed with a number, such as 140 or 220 \u2013 this refers to their weight in grams, and the higher the number, the warmer, but heavier, the base layer.\n\nBase layers are made either with synthetic materials such as polyester or natural materials such as merino wool.\n\nNatural materials feel best against the skin, and we really rate merino wool, which is warm, soft and naturally moisture-wicking \u2013 merino base layers are pricier but worth investing in if you\u2019re going to use them regularly.\n\nLook for a blend of merino or 100 per cent merino. A good new option on the market are bamboo base layers, which are antibacterial and soft to wear.\n\nAs well as simple designs in plain colours, base layers increasingly come in bright colours, stripes and patterns \u2013 these work well as standalone tops for casual wear or for a spot of apres on the slopes as well as for the more serious business of keeping you warm all winter long.\n\nWe tested out the latest base layers on multi-day cold weather hikes and compared them for warmth, breathability and comfort.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Icebreaker offers a great range of merino base layers in different weights (the higher the number, the warmer the base layer) but our pick are the excellent 200 Oasis leggings top and leggings. Versatile, beautifully cut, comfortable to wear all day \u2013 there\u2019s nothing not to like here. A high neck version of the top is also available.\n\nBuy top now\n\nBuy bottoms now\n\nKJUS trace half zip thermal top: \u00a395, KJUS\n\nThis smart microfleece top is wonderfully soft to wear and to touch. Pull it on and you\u2019ll immediately feel it warming you up and trapping your body heat. It\u2019s not too warm, though \u2013 we found it breathable enough to deal with fast-paced skiing and hiking without overheating, and the zipped neck comes in handy for regulating your temperature. It\u2019s nicely cut to move as you do and looks flattering, too. We reckon this is a top worth splashing out on.\n\nBuy now\n\nBAM bamboo snuggly thermal bottoms: \u00a342, BAM\n\nSnuggly by name and nature, these soft-as-anything leggings were the cosiest bottoms we tested. You\u2019ll never want to take them off \u2013 and they double up as pyjama bottoms on really cold nights as well as working for skiing, winter hiking \u2013 even yoga. The wide, supportive waistband stays put whatever shapes you throw. BAM\u2019S soft athleisure pieces are all made from bamboo, which is a bit of a wonder material \u2013 antibacterial, breathable and an ecologically sustainable resource. A versatile pick, especially if you value great comfort.\n\nBuy now\n\nMountain Warehouse talus top and bottoms: Both from \u00a39.99, Mountain Warehouse\n\nCan you own a great set of base layers for under \u00a330? It seems so with this simple but effective set from Mountain Warehouse. Both feel soft to touch and warm to wear, but aren\u2019t breathable enough to deal with hard-charging skiing or warmer spring days \u2013 save this set for colder weather, as its Isotherm technology traps in heat well. A great choice for a first ski holiday, as a spare set of base layers or just if you\u2019re on a budget. You may need to go for a size down for a slim, heat-retaining fit.\n\nBuy top now\n\nBuy bottoms now\n\nPatagonia capilene midweight crew top: \u00a360, Patagonia\n\nThis top comes in a variety of colours and patterns, and we reckon it\u2019s smart enough to wear with jeans as a normal top when you aren\u2019t out in the mountains. It still packs a technical punch, though \u2013 the honeycomb-like material traps in warmth but is still breathable when you\u2019re working up a sweat. The top is treated for odour control, which does prove effective on test \u2013 this is a good choice if you\u2019re going ski-touring away from showers for a few days. The cut is boxy, so go a size down if you prefer a slim fit.\n\nBuy now\n\nHowies Deryn merino thermal top: \u00a355, Howies\n\nSailor top or technical base layer? We\u2019re big fans of the lovely looks of British brand Howie\u2019s stripy Deryn top, which comes in four colour versions. This may look like your favourite Breton top, but it\u2019s also a high-performing base layer, and is made with 100 per cent merino wool to keep sweat, odour and bacteria at bay. The longer-length cut is also great for keeping your torso warm. A brilliant choice for regular use both on the mountains and off.\n\nBuy now\n\nBerghaus thermal tech top: \u00a345, Berghaus\n\nWe love the reassuringly thick fabric of Berghaus\u2019 thermal tech top, which has a silky, comfortable feel against the skin. It has a boxier fit than other slim-cut base layers we tested, but still does a good job of retaining heat. We found this top to be one of the more breathable tops on test, and it wicks away sweat and odours well. It\u2019s also quick-drying \u2013 a good choice if you tend to overheat when wearing base layers.\n\nBuy now\n\nOOSC Every day is a Saturday base layer set: \u00a380, OOSC\n\nIn a sea of plain, sensible base layers, new ski brand OOSC\u2019s weird and wonderful prints really stand out. Its thermals come in a variety of bright and cheerful patterns, but we love Every Day is a Saturday\u2019s eye-catching geometric pink and blue design. These base layers have a flattering, slim fit, a silky outer material and a delightfully cosy fleecy inside, and the trousers incorporate a comfortable waistband. OOSC\u2019s offerings weren\u2019t the warmest base layers on test \u2013 wear these for spring skiing and then show them off at apes ski. After all, they look so nice it\u2019s a shame to cover them up with outerwear.\n\nPre-order now\n\nDare 2b confirm thermal top: \u00a334.95, Dare 2b\n\nYou\u2019ll probably either love or hate the eye-wateringly busy geometrical print here. If you\u2019re in the former camp, then you\u2019ll get a comfortable and warm base layer for well under \u00a350. This was one of the warmest, but least breathable, base layers on test \u2013 good for really chilly mornings. We really rated the neck, which is cosy without feeling restrictive, with a handy half zip for ventilation. The top also has stretchy side panels that make it flattering and form-fitting.\n\nBuy now\n\nAlpine trek smartwool merino 250 zip top: \u00a391.95, Alpine trek\n\nThere\u2019s lots of lovely stuff packed into this top, and for a top-end price you get a high-performing 100 per cent merino top, with a zippable, comfortable neck, a flattering, heat-holding slim fit and reliable warmth and breathability. We like the nicely-cut shoulder panels, which don\u2019t rub if you\u2019re wearing a backpack. This is our top pick if you\u2019re shopping for 100 per cent merino base layers, and it comes in a range of handsome muted shades that work well for daily use.\n\nBuy now\n\n30Seven ski mesh base layer heated top: \u00a3146 (heating element sold separately \u00a342), 30Seven\n\nAnd now for something completely different. 30Seven\u2019s clever, breathable mesh fabric is heated with rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and can keep you toasty warm for up to seven hours. This gilet-style top can be worn with or without the battery, but although it\u2019s called a base layer, we would wear a thin long-sleeved top underneath for comfort. That heating tech makes the 30Seven pricy, but if you feel the cold or have to work outdoors for extended periods of time, adding this to your winter layering system could really help to keep the chill at bay.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Base layers\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with Icebreaker\u2019s excellent merino base layers in various weights. For comfort, we love BAM\u2019s snuggly leggings, and for something a little different, go for OOSC\u2019s eye-catching prints.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
