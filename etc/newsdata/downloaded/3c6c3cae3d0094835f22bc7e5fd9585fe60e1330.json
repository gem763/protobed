As 27 September dawned, Kanye West fans \u2013 those that remain \u2013 were braced for the release of the rapper\u2019s much-heralded new gospel album, Jesus is King. But midnight came and went, and the wee hours trickled by. The Twitter pledge made by West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian \u2013 \u00adthat the LP would see the light of day \u2013 rang increasingly hollow. Jesus had left the building. Assuming there ever was a building in the first place.\n\nSo it has gone whenever West has raised his head above the pulpit lately. He has \u2013 and perhaps not in a positive sense \u2013 claimed the mantle left by Prince, as pop\u2019s foremost eccentric. This resolve to fit nobody\u2019s parameters but his own was underscored at the 2019 Coachella festival in California, at which he introduced his new gospel troupe, the Sunday Service.\n\nAs if determined to take his God complex to the inevitable next level, Kanye sported Messiah-style robes. Flanking him were ranks of backing singers kumbaya-ing all the way to tea-time. They were arranged on a round green hill that resembled something from kid\u2019s television. It was like listening to your favourite hip-hop record after you\u2019ve passed out watching too much Teletubbies.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe world needs outr\u00e9 chart stars. How dull pop has become since the genre was claimed as the plaything of the cautious and the careerist. But the most notable feature of Kanye\u2019s latest non-album release is what a trifling story it makes for. The public\u2019s indifference is louder than the high-fashion sneakers that Kanye has designed for Adidas.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A Kanye data breach would once have tilted the pop on its axis. Now it was a tree crashing to earth in the world\u2019s emptiest forest. One rumour is that Kanye is holding out to achieve leverage over his record label. In January he filed a lawsuit again Universal Music. This was apparently in an attempt to gain the rights to his catalogue (a second case against EMI Music Publishing was settled this week).\n\nWhether supporting Donald Trump or feuding with Taylor Swift, West has of course been busily sabotaging his career for years. It isn\u2019t entirely beyond the bounds that it\u2019s all some vast existential jape on his part (Prince would have got the joke). That isn\u2019t to downplay the genuine issue of his mental wellbeing. West has stated that he has bipolar disorder. In 2016 he was hospitalised for \u201ctemporary psychosis\u201d caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation.\n\nHe addressed these issues \u2013 or at least winked at them \u2013 on 2018\u2019s Ye album. \u201cI hate being bi-polar/ it\u2019s awesome\u201d was the message scrawled on the cover of the record \u2013 one of several projects Kanye produced at his ranch compound in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. A sequel LP, Yandhi, was promised for later that year, again assembled in the mountainous American West. But then Kanye decamped to his hometown of Chicago and later to Uganda for further sessions.\n\nBack in Wyoming, meanwhile, he has instituted his weekly \u201cSunday Service\u201d rehearsal with a choir performing retooled highlights of his catalogue. A glimpse at his new direction could be gleaned from that performance at Coachella, which can be watched in YouTube in all its zany glory. And then it emerged that Yandhi had been sidelined by a renamed / entirely new (nobody is sure) record, Jesus is King.\n\nSuch convolutions would be a lot to keep pace with, even if Kanye West was still the Kanye West of the mid-2000s. At that time, he embodied a thrilling new chapter in hip-hop. Rap had gone stadium-sized. Yet West was willing to showcase the previously verboten emotions of doubt and vulnerability. And on those occasions, he did venture out on a limb \u2013 mourning his mother on the Auto-tune drenched \u201c808s and Heartbreak\u201d, for instance \u2013 the onus was on us to keep up with a maverick rather than on Kanye to explain himself.\n\nBut the line between genius and freewheeling egotist can be thin, in pop especially. West\u2019s feud with Taylor Swift \u2013 difficult to regard as anything other than misogynist on his part \u2013 and his support for Donald Trump \u2013 who is difficult to regard as anything other than a tangerine racist \u2013 understandably alienated much of his fanbase. A gospel-tinged, come-to-the-light record might have gone towards salvaging a reputation more faded than the Shroud of Turin. Or it may have at least have made us care again. Instead, the LP\u2019s non-appearance will cause the one-time Kanye nation to suspect, and not for the first time, that their fallen idol is trolling us all from on high.", "description": "As of now, there is no mount and there is no sermon.
