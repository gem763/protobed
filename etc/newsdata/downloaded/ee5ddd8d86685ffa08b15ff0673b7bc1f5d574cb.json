Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Friday that Kiribati had officially notified his government of the decision.\n\nLast week was a difficult one for Taiwan, as the Solomon Islands also said Monday that it was ditching Taipei for Beijing.\n\nHome to 660,000 people, the Solomon Islands were easily Taiwan's largest remaining ally in the Pacific; the country's foreign minister signed a deal on diplomatic ties with Beijing in China on Saturday.\n\nBoth the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are small developing nations but lie in strategic waters that have been dominated by the US and its allies since World War II. The Solomons are directly between Australia and the US and has access to airfields and deepwater ports dating to World War II.\n\nWu said China used investments in fisheries and other industries to build up a presence in Kiribati, penetrating political circles and extending its influence. The president of Kiribati had requested \"massive financial assistance\" from Taiwan to buy commercial aircraft, which Wu said was inconsistent with Taiwan's international aid law.\n\n'Everybody should remain patient'\n\nLagoons can be seen from a plane as it flies above Kiritimati Island, part of the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati, April 5, 2016 Reuters\n\nChina and Kiribati had ties until 2003, when Tarawa established relations with Taipei, causing China to break off diplomatic relations.\n\nUntil then, China had operated the space tracking station in Kiribati, which played a role in tracking China's first manned space flight in 2003, just before the suspension of ties.\n\nSpeaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang did not answer a question about what would happen with the former space tracking station.\n\nOn the timing of when China and Kiribati will formally resume diplomatic relations, Geng said: \"What should happen will come sooner or later. Everybody should remain patient.\"\n\n\"We look forward to resuming diplomatic relations with Kiribati and opening a new page in the two countries' relations,\" Geng said.\n\nHe said China also believed this would serve both countries' people and would be beneficial for peace, stability and prosperity for Pacific island countries.\n\nChina has welcome Kiribati's decision though the two have not yet officially signed an agreement to resume ties.\n\nA former Taiwanese ambassador to Kiribati, Abraham Chu, told Taiwan's Central News Agency over the weekend that China had never fully removed the tracking station in Kiribati and said China's then-ambassador in Kiribati was a space expert.\n\nThe equipment was locked away and guarded by four fishermen, Chu said. \"It seems it can come back at any time,\" he added, referring to the tracking station. The Kiribati government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina's space program is overseen by the military. China's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n'Then what happens?'\n\nA boat sits on a reef-mud flat close to a lagoon at South Tarawa in the central Pacific island nation of Kiribati, May 23, 2013. Thomson Reuters\n\nTaiwan has 15 allies left, compared to about 180 countries that recognize China.\n\nMost of Taiwan's remaining allies are small and poor nations in Latin America and the Pacific. Of those, five are small Pacific Island countries. The Marshall Islands and Palau have close ties with the US and are unlikely to switch any time soon, but experts say Nauru and Tuvalu could soon switch.\n\nChina has signaled it is coming for the rest of its allies, and Beijing crowed about the sudden changes by the Solomons and Kiribati.\n\n\"This fully testifies to the fact that the one-China principle meets the shared aspiration of the people and constitutes an irresistible trend of the times,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.\n\nLosing all its allies would mean Taiwan's government no longer has formal outside recognition and make it harder to contest Beijing's claim over the island, which it sees as a breakaway province.\n\n\"Other countries will call you a non-state and then what happens?\" Chao Chien-min, dean of social sciences at the Chinese Cultural University in Taipei, told Reuters. \"Let's say the People's Liberation Army uses non-peaceful means for an activity in the Taiwan Strait. The United Nations can't do anything. If other countries get involved, what legitimacy do they have to help Taiwan?\"\n\n(Reporting by Michael Martina and Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Lidia Kelly in Melbourne, Editing by Timothy Heritage)", "description": "China will formally resume ties soon with Kiribati, Beijing said Monday, following the Pacific island state's decision to ditch relations with Taiwan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88f3be2e22af1db972fc19-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
