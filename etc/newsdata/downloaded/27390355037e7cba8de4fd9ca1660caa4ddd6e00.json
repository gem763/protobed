If humiliation, detention and prison wasn't enough for #FIFA to take action now one us burnt herself to show Iranian women want to watch football too. #\u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631_\u0622\u0628\u06cc\n\nKhodayari appeared in a Tehran court last week. When the case was adjourned, she poured gasoline over herself and set herself on fire. She died on Monday September 9.\n\nIran's Judiciary has been asked to investigate the circumstances surrounding Khodayari's death, the country's semi-official Fars News agency reported Thursday.\n\nAccording to Fars, Khodayari was \"transferred to Tehran's Motahhari Hospital with third-degree burns on 90% of her body and severe damage to her lungs.\"\n\nThe news agency also said that her father had claimed that Khodayari suffered from mental illness and had \"stopped treatment against her doctor's repeated warnings.\"\n\nKhodayari's father has also asked the public to stop \"misusing his daughter's death\" and to show \"respect\" for the family, Fars reported.\n\nEsteghlal supporters attend the AFC Champions League group C football match between Iran's Esteghlal and Qatar's Al Duhail at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran on May 6, 2019.\n\nHer death has sparked anger both in Iran and across the world.\n\nActivist Maryam Shojaei told CNN that she has written eight letters to FIFA President Gianni Infantino to inform him of the current challenges faced by female soccer fans in Iran.\n\nShe also says she delivered a letter to FIFA's secretary general Fatma Samoura and urged her to take action.\n\n\"I think FIFA is the one to blame and if they enforced their own human rights and gender discrimination rules, Sahar would have been alive today,\" she said.\n\n\"They said they would ask Iran to end this ban and to provide safety for women but releasing a statement is one thing and enforcing it ... this issue is time sensitive. You know we cannot wait. We have been waiting for 40 years and I think that's more than enough.\n\n\"Now FIFA has to take action immediately by enforcing its own human rights rules.\"\n\nFIFA responded, saying it \"refutes any suggestion it has been inactive in the fight for these women's rights in Iran. We are working with the Iranian Football Association in the hope and expectation that women will be in attendance at future games beginning with the FIFA World Cup qualifiers in October.\"\n\nIran's ban on women attending sports stadiums was put in place shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Amnesty and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have both called on football's world governing body FIFA to end the ban.\n\nIn June, FIFA sent a letter to the Iranian Football Federation (FFIRI), requesting a timeline that would allow women to be able to buy tickets for World Cup qualifiers, Reuters reported.\n\nIran's men's national team faces Cambodia in a World Cup qualifier in Tehran on October 10 -- a game Shojaei hopes women will be allowed to attend.\n\n\"I'm very positive that by October 10 it will let women inside and what happened to Sahar and the whole international attention this issue received, I think the problem is going to be solved.\"\n\nIran's top football team holds a minute of silence before training, in honor of their fan #BlueGirl who set herself on fire and died, after she was arrested for trying to enter the stadium dressed as a boy.pic.twitter.com/GROlKfcQRx \u2014 Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) September 12, 2019\n\nKhodayari's death has sparked a global outcry.\n\nHer favorite club, Esteghlal, published a statement on its website mourning her death and players held a moment of silence in her honor on Wednesday.\n\n\"The tragic death of our beloved child, Ms. Sahar Khodayari, has caused much sadness and regret for Esteghlal FC,\" the club said.\n\n\"We offer condolences to you and your relatives, ask God for mercy and forgiveness and also patience and health for your family and all soccer fans.\"\n\nSeveral women's soccer players are calling on FIFA to act.\n\nI have a platform and I have never been afraid of raising my voice when in need.This is a tragedy and it can't continue anymore. @FIFAcom it's time to act and not be silent.WE need to help the women of Iran fight against gender apartheid.This is about human rights!#SaharKhodayari https://t.co/UE4r071Niv \u2014 Kosovare Asllani (@KosovareAsllani) September 10, 2019\n\nSweden star Kosovare Asllani tweeted: \"I have a platform and I have never been afraid of raising my voice when in need.
