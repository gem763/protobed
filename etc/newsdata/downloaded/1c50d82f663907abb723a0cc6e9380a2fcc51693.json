Unwanted at Juventus, Mandzukic had been in talks with the Qatari side Al Rayyan, but it has now become apparent he will not be joining them. Should United be unsuccessful in their efforts to land the 33-year-old this time around, they may turn their attention to the Lyon striker Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 instead. The Old Trafford outfit continue to be linked with Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho, although the Rumour Mill can think of no earthly reason why such a talented youngster would entertain the notion of leaving his current employers to take up with a club that is fast approaching basket case status.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r accepts Manchester United need more strikers Read more\n\nUnited winger Tahith Chong is on the fringes of the first team, but has only had bit-parts in three senior games across three different competitions so far this season. PSV are hopeful of giving him more game time if they can get him on loan in January. Having taken Romelu Lukaku off United\u2019s hands during the summer, Inter may now move for Nemanja Matic.\n\nArsenal are prepared to send Mesut \u00d6zil out on loan if they can find any takers for a misfit who has made just one Premier League appearance so far this season. Currently paying their non-playing playmaker \u00a3350,000 per week, the club are prepared to supplement the lion\u2019s share of his wages, much like United do for Alexis S\u00e1nchez as he gads about in Italy for Inter.\n\nWest Ham midfielder Declan Rice is a man in demand, but his employers are prepared to slap a price-tag of \u00a3100m on him in the hope of scaring off potential suitors. In dire need of a man of the 20-year-old\u2019s talents, Manchester United were repeatedly linked with him over the summer and may try to turn his head in the next transfer window.\n\nHaving just masterminded his third consecutive \u2013 and fourth in total \u2013 defeat of the season, Milan coach Marco Giampaolo has been given the dreaded voted of confidence from club director of football Paolo Maldini. \u201cWe chose the coach, we will defend him, it is right to give him some time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew there were some problems that we\u2019d run into, although obviously we didn\u2019t expect to lose four of the first six games, but also the quality of the football is unsatisfactory.\u201d\n\nWith Giampaolo\u2019s dismissal looking inevitable, Milan may try to replace him with thr former Juventus manager Max Allegri. Currently on sabbatical, the 52-year-old had been tipped to take over at Tottenham Hotspur when Mauricio Pochettino inevitably decides he\u2019s done all he can at White Hart Lane and accepts a more tempting offer from somewhere else. Or takes over at Manchester United.", "description": "Tahith Chong to PSV Eindhoven? | Arsenal to send Mesut \u00d6zil out on loan?
