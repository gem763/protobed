The driver of the Avalanche was uninjured.\n\nA rep for Harris did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nPolice said Pedro Cruz, a Taos County firefighter/EMT, responded to the scene and found his daughter dead upon arrival.\n\nTEXAS COUNTRY SINGER KYLIE RAE HARRIS, 30, KILLED IN CAR CRASH\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office also suspects speed and intoxication were factors in the accident, though authorities are awaiting a toxicology report from the Office of the Medical Investigator before making any official determination.\n\nCourt records indicate that Harris had a history of drinking and driving.
