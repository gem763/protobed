In our view, the BoC will need to see more cracks in the Canadian economy relative to the new Monetary Policy Report projections to consider easing monetary conditions.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Report base case scenario still pegs real GDP growth forecasts close to potential in 2020 (1.7% instead of 1.9%) and 2021 (1.8% instead of 2.0%) even though the outlook was revised down.
