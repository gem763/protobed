The scrum is a massive weapon for the Boks. They have two excellent front rows and the best locks in the competition,\" Plumtree wrote.\n\n\"The Boks will put Japan under immense pressure - far more than they\u2019ve experienced so far in the tournament. The positive for the Japanese is they\u2019ve already experienced that pressure in a warm-up game against the Boks a month ago. They will know what\u2019s coming, it\u2019s just a question of whether their forwards can step up for 80 minutes.\"\n\nThe Springboks beat Japan 41-7 in a World Cup warm-up match in Kumagaya last month, while the Japanese won the previous encounter 34-32 in Brighton during the 2015 World Cup in England.\n\n- Compiled by Herman Mostert", "description": "Hurricanes coach John Plumtree says Japan will face a massive test up front in their Rugby World Cup quarter-final against the Springboks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5525/ebd4007cc0944817abb334beb0632409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
