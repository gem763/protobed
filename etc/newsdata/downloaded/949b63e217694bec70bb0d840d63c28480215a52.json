Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement of an official impeachment inquiry into his conduct, complaining on Twitter that none of his White House predecessors have \u201cbeen treated so badly\u201d during their time in office.\n\n\u201cThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done,\u201d Trump wrote online. \u201cThis should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nThe morning message followed a string of posts Tuesday night sharing clips of segments by his conservative cable news allies \u2014 including Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity of Fox News, as well as Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network \u2014 blasting Pelosi\u2019s historic maneuver and defending Trump amid heightened scrutiny over his summer phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nDuring that conversation on July 25 between the two leaders, which is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 renewed push to oust the president from office, Trump reportedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky roughly eight times to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\n\"There has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have\" \u2014 Donald Trump via Twitter\n\nPOLITICO reported in August that the president was slow-walking hundreds of millions of dollars in military funds to Ukraine, and the the Washington Post reported Monday that Trump directed his acting White House chief of staff to hold back the financial aid at least a week before his call with Zelenskiy.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements during the call are also believed to be a component of the complaint an anonymous whistleblower filed in early August to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, who deemed the allegations credible and \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nTrump on Tuesday afternoon announced he had authorized the release sometime Wednesday of \u201cthe complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of his call with Zelenskiy.
