These acts, and the expression of solidarity with them, run counter to the values of the club.\"\n\nSahin's existing contract will remain valid, but St. Pauli has given him permission to train and play for other clubs. Sahin, who joined the German team from Istanbul Basaksehir in 2016, is reportedly back in Turkey. A switch can only be completed in the winter transfer window.\n\nNow in its seventh day, Turkey's offensive against the Kurds has upended alliances and is re-drawing the map of northern Syria for yet another time in Syria's 8-year-old war.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Several players of the Turkish national soccer team defied an investigation by the European soccer body after celebrating a goal with a military-style salute during a match against France.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19287747721763.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
