(Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nHere we go again \u2014 our nation\u2019s leaders are sticking it to kids.\n\nAnd in this case, it\u2019s the kids of all those military men and women everyone likes to salute and praise and honor. When it\u2019s convenient.\n\nWhile they go to work defending our country, thousands of parents in the military trust the welfare of their kids to child-care centers on base. It\u2019s one of the things that the military usually does really well.\n\nBut here in the Washington area, on the very base that President Trump uses nearly every time he flies out to one of his golf courses (229 golf games so far during his presidency), the Joint Base Andrews Children\u2019s Development Center is in danger.\n\nParents complained when the playground was inaccessible for months and kids had no space to frolic and that the bathrooms look sketchy with huge holes in the tiles. The center\u2019s Facebook feed chronicles power outages, air conditioning troubles, phones and computers being dead and damage done by a car that hit the building.\n\nSo finally, Congress approved $13 million in the 2019 budget to give this important base the kind of child-care facility it deserves.\n\n\n\nDeMarco and her husband, Senior Master Sgt.

The Trump administration just killed the funding for this project, as well as a handful of others at schools and family support facilities on military bases.\n\nWait until you hear why.\n\n[Pentagon approves diversion of military funding for border wall]\n\nIn a frantic cash grab, the folks in power released a list of Defense Department projects they are raiding to fund the border wall that the majority of Americans said they don\u2019t want. All in time for the 2020 election.\n\nThe projects they are defunding include a toxic waste warehouse and a fire and crash rescue station \u2014 some crucial-sounding operations. So are the projects for military kids \u2014 the Andrews day care as well as a middle school in Fort Campbell, Ky., and an elementary school in Fort Bragg, N.C.\n\n\n\nMaster Sgt.

(Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s move represents a betrayal of military families, many of whom supported him in the 2016 election. The day cares are especially crucial for parents.\n\nI\u2019ll always remember how Air Force Master Sgt. Tracy DeMarco told me, nearly a decade ago, how she watched her daughter take some of her first steps via Skype while she was deployed. \u201cI jumped up and nearly hugged the screen,\u201d DeMarco said.\n\nI caught up with her when she was back on American soil, picking up that child from the day care at Andrews, which was convenient to her job at the base. But all facilities need investment. And this one was finally about to get some help.\n\n[Deployed and a mom. How military moms make it work.]\n\nThe families at Andrews had been waiting for years for a major renovation and expansion. An environmental impact report on the project in 2013 lists the problems with the primary child- care building, which was built in 1943. Multiple rooms couldn\u2019t be used because of mold, and the facility had old heating and air conditioning systems. At the time, there were 130 children on the waiting list who couldn\u2019t be accommodated, forcing them to use much more expensive day care off base.\n\n\u201cMost bases have a long list of requirements that need repair,\u201d said Brian McKeon, a former Pentagon official who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.\n\nSo if a project even made the list to go before Congress and get approval, it \u201cmeans very likely they\u2019re in bad shape,\u201d McKeon said.\n\nAnd delaying a project already in dire need will be even more difficult to repair later on, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not only dangerous but also does very little to make good on all those yellow ribbons folks like to wear supporting troops, said Maryland\u2019s Rep. Anthony G. Brown (D), a veteran.\n\n\u201cEarlier today I was notified that important construction projects in Maryland \u2014 including at Joint Base Andrews \u2014 will be canceled in order to build President Trump\u2019s wall,\u201d he wrote on Facebook on Wednesday. \u201cThis will hurt morale, degrade readiness and make America less safe. President Trump should not build his ineffective, xenophobic vanity project on the backs of our service members and military families.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s also consider the millions of dollars in contracts that were once headed to local construction companies and engineering firms.\n\nOh wait, some of the contractors in Maryland will still have work.\n\nThe two new presidential airplanes \u2014 billion-dollar projects \u2014 are on their way to Andrews. And the new planes are soooo big that a whole new hangar has to be built for them.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re not touching that $315 million project to build the wall or to give military families better child-care facilities. The kids will have to just wait.\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "The president just diverted millions of dollars that were supposed to fix a decaying day care at Joint Base Andrews and schools at Fort Bragg and Fort Campbell.", "authors": ["Petula Dvorak", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ArXlPpTSydDqNTrQt1s6hPX2sGQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CDNADFTYKUI6BIEB43HSNY2XAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
