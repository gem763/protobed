What if they weren\u2019t about pursuing dominance over men? And what if their structures inspired all societies to achieve true gender equality?\n\nGerman philosopher and researcher Heide Goettner-Abendroth has dedicated her life to answering these questions, and talked to HuffPost France last month about what she has learned.\n\nHer seminal book, \u201cMatriarchal Societies: Studies on Indigenous Cultures Across the Globe\u201d \u2014 which made its debut in Germany in 2010, in the English-speaking world in 2012 and this year in France \u2014 offers an unprecedented, comprehensive account of matriarchal societies. It draws on decades of research to blend theory with fieldwork and shed light on a topic widely ignored by ethnologists.\n\nMatriarchal societies predate patriarchy, says Groettner-Abendroth, who founded the International Academy HAGIA for Modern Matriarchal Studies, an association that focuses on matriarchal societies, mythology, medicine and spirituality. She created the academy after she became fed up with the male-dominated power structures at conventional institutions, and she has no problem saying her approach centers women.\n\nGoettner-Abendroth discusses the local communities she has studied \u2014 from China to Africa, from Indonesia to North America \u2014 that are all either complete or nearly complete forms of matriarchy. This means that they are either matrilineal, whereby lineage is traced through the mother, or matrilocal, in the sense that new couples go to live with the young woman\u2019s community. Some of them have abandoned these fundamental pillars but still practice rituals and impart values that draw direct inspiration from their matriarchal origins.\n\nHuffPost France talked to Goettner-Abendroth about her research, the philosophical roots that underpin these societies, and what it means to live somewhere where respecting women is not optional.\n\nIn your view, what is the founding principle of each of these matriarchal societies?\n\nIt is the power to give life. If women do not give life, the society dies out. In our societies, this power is not considered very valuable. Women are left to their own devices and have to tackle maternity alone. They are not respected. Matriarchal societies are anchored in maternity. An abandoned child or woman is unheard of within them.\n\nIn the Minangkabau culture in Indonesia, everyone is a mother. Men distinguish themselves when they behave properly toward children; they are praised for being \u201cgood mothers.\u201d\n\nWhat values do these societies represent?\n\nThey are egalitarian, considerate and nurturing, in the sense that taking care of others and their well-being is self-evident. In the Khasi culture in India, the clan mother \u2015 the chief of the village \u2015 is chosen according to her ability to help her people.\n\nEveryone is respected, regardless of their age or sex. They take care of the elderly until their death. There are no hierarchies among people. Decisions are made by consensus, unanimously. They conduct a sharing economy and condemn the concept of accumulation.\n\nBut isn\u2019t it easier to create this kind of harmony in clans of so few members? In a nation of several million inhabitants, unanimity is difficult to achieve.\n\nCertainly, some of the clans are small and consist of roughly 100 people, but others, like the Minangkabau in Indonesia, count 6 million members \u2014 almost as much as the population of Switzerland. They are not strictly matriarchal, because the current political authority has imposed patriarchy, but the matriarchy is still manifested through cultural practices.\n\nThe Mosuo of China have 250,000 members. When plans emerged to build an airport in their region, which threatened the community, they managed to push back against the project by consulting with each member of the various clans. And they only gave their response once they had achieved unanimity. It took them three months.\n\nThe Minangkabau in Indonesia had a similar struggle, but the government forced its will through and Sumatra now has an airport.\n\nIn these societies, do women abuse their power at men\u2019s expense?\n\nNo. They do not consider it power as such, but responsibilities they are obligated to assume. They do often have control of the purse strings, not to keep the money for themselves, but to distribute it fairly and to ensure that the clan will never lack the things it needs.\n\nTheir societies are organized in such a way that the idea of domination simply doesn\u2019t exist. These societies are largely peaceful, but they do know how to use weapons to defend themselves \u2014 for example, in the indigenous communities in the Amazon and North America. It\u2019s not that they are better than us, but the way their societies are structured facilitates a state of peace.\n\nDoes prostitution exist in matriarchal societies?\n\nNo! Not in the least. The same is true for rape. Women, their sexuality and their power to give birth are respected. No man would dare touch a woman against her will. The clan system protects each woman.\n\nIs homosexuality permitted?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to respond to that question because I personally have not been able to broach the subject over the course of my encounters. It\u2019s a very difficult aspect to study. One of my colleagues reported that children of the Juchitan clan in Mexico can choose their gender. All they have to do is tell their mother, who will reply to her son, for example, \u201cOh, how wonderful, I\u2019m going to have another daughter.\u201d She will proceed to give him girls clothing. The same goes for girls who want to become boys.\n\nIn your description of the Kashi in India, you recount that the love interests of young women can be beaten by her brothers, kidnapped and held prisoner at the home of the woman who wants to enter into a sexual relationship. Isn\u2019t this a case of a power relationship that negatively impacts men?\n\n(Laughs) What I described there is nothing more than a game among young people. It may seem brutal, but in reality, they\u2019re having fun. Sexuality in these societies is experienced as a game. No one tries to make others feel guilty for having the desire to make love. Once a woman becomes infatuated with someone other than her husband, she separates from him, without creating a stir. Monogamy is considered a form of repression against women. They are not polygamous, but they do regularly change partners.\n\nWhich in turn influences parenthood.\n\nAbsolutely. Women have several partners over the course of their lives, so when they do have children, it is not their biological fathers who take care of them, but rather the brothers of the women. Men become the fathers of their nephews and nieces. Of course, if a man requests to play a more significant role in the life of his biological child, the clan will implement a system that grants him that role. But it\u2019s the mother\u2019s bloodline that counts.\n\nYou classify the Tuaregs as a matriarchal society, but women are the keepers of the familial tent, while men spend their days outside. Isn\u2019t this just yet another variant of the patriarchy?\n\nNot at all. The Tuareg women maintain control of the family finances. Everything men earn outside is brought back to the tent. The oldest woman divides and shares the money in equal parts. She is the holder of the clan\u2019s fortune. She is the one who safeguards it, because she represents security, a guarantee. She does not own the house. Tuareg men attest that they give the money to the women because they are the givers of life and doing so secures their future.\n\nWhat issues do matriarchal societies address?\n\nFirst of all, these societies have the advantage of reconciling every type of feminism. We are dealing with too many diverging perspectives, which are obscuring the movement\u2019s initial objective. Today, matriarchal societies can help us adjust our point of view, especially regarding women\u2019s pleasure. We can use them to create a new narrative, one that frees us of the burden of guilt.\n\nWestern feminism does not view male-female relations in their entirety. It only takes into account the women\u2019s viewpoint, but this is a paradigm that leads us nowhere. We have to go further and propose solutions that are more in line with the foundations of matriarchal societies.\n\nThen, we need to push ourselves out of the current era, which I call the \u201csuper patriarchy.\u201d It is a mix of neoliberalism, militarism and commercial exploitation of nature. It\u2019s a path bound for self-destruction. Since the \u201csuper patriarchy\u201d is incapable of putting a stop to itself, it\u2019s up to us to turn toward alternatives, led by radical feminists, indigenous peoples and supporters of the sharing economy. There are so many of us who no longer want this world we\u2019ve created, so if we band together to form a community, we can try to create a different experience.\n\nMaybe one day we\u2019ll even manage to install our own matriarchal system.", "description": "German philosopher and researcher Heide Goettner-Abendroth talked to HuffPost France about indigenous cultures that put respect for women at the forefront.", "authors": ["Annabel Benhaiem", "Huffpost France"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f4ffb210000e706343880.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
