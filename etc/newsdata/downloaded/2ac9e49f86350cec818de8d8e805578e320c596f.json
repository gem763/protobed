But after a failed round of IVF and countless tests, she was informed that her chances of ever conceiving were slim to none.\n\nBut things took a complete 180\u00b0 when she and her then-husband decided to go their own separate ways, and Natalie met her current beau, Chris Harries. Just after five dates, the beautician knew she wanted to make things official with him.\n\n\u201cI was 33 years old and single so I gave up all hope of becoming a mom,\u201d she admitted\n\n\u201cWe had only been seeing each other for two weeks and only slept together once when I got pregnant.\u201d\n\nNatalie, who was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 12, had always known she\u2019d have trouble conceiving but when the unexpected happened, she couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just come back from a holiday with my friends, I was feeling knackered, I felt swollen and my breasts were hurting but I thought it was due to PCSO,\u201d she said.\n\nBut when a friend suggested she take a pregnancy test there was nothing that could\u2019ve prepared her for the results.\n\n\u201cI was stunned when it said I was nine weeks pregnant,\u201d she revealed.\n\nEven though Natalie was scared to tell Chris about the news because of the short time they\u2019d been seeing each other, he was thrilled with the news.\n\n\u201cAt first I couldn\u2019t believe it, I was in shock. She told me over the phone and I was with my mates at the time and didn\u2019t know how to react. We agreed to meet the next day,\u201d Chris said.\n\nThey\u2019re now proud parents to Grayson.", "description": "After four years of marriage and being told she could never have children, a woman fell pregnant just two weeks into a new relationship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9519/f240382ee3384e7dac667903f174999c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
