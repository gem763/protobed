Now it\u2019s Elizabeth Warren\u2019s daughter who is raising eyebrows", "language": "en", "text": "It appears that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, is reportedly chairwoman Demos, a liberal think tank, which gave the Working Families Party $45,000 in 2017-2018. This is significant because the Working Families Party just issued a surprise endorsement of Elizabeth Warren for president:\n\nNEWS: Think tank @Demos_Org gave @WorkingFamilies Party $45,000 in 2017-2018. @ewarren's daughter Amelia is chairwoman of Demos. Despite this, she is currently not listed on Demos website (but it still shows up on Google).

Warren\u2019s 60.9% win combined two totals: A vote by WFP leaders, and an online member vote. Each of those counted for 50% of total but WFP won\u2019t release the separate tallies. \u2014 Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 16, 2019\n\nFWIW, in 2015, WFP released the results of the online membership survey: 87% for Sanders. https://t.co/e4xA3llVfL \u2014 Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 16, 2019\n\nI talked to WFP\u2019s national director Maurice Mitchell earlier, and he made clear that the group won\u2019t release separate vote totals. \"For there to be one true vote, and to maintain the nature of secret ballot, all of that went into the back end.\" \u2014 Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 16, 2019\n\nThis does look bad:\n\nIf the son of @BernieSanders was the head of a lemonade stand and that lemonade stand donated to @WorkingFamiliesParty and then WFP endorsed Bernie\u2026. 1) MSNBC would switch from #RussiaGate to #BernieGate\n\n2) Washington Post would write 125 negative Bernie stories in 16 hours \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign treasurer is also on the board of Demos:\n\nLastly, and maybe the MOST troubling\u2026Warren's campaign treasurer is STILL on the board of @Demos_Org\u2014who donated $45K to @WorkingFamilies. This also was not disclosed by WFP. THIS STINKS TO THE HIGH HEAVENS. https://t.co/L5vjN4nJaK \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\nMore on the potential scandal here:\n\nA source of mine familiar with Working Families Party's inner dynamics told me at the time of the @ewarren endorsement that they were \"broke\" and expect more money to come into it as a result of Warren endorsement. In light of this news, it goes without saying\u2026. \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\n1) @WorkingFamilies should've disclosed this at time of its endorsement for Warren 2) WFP should immediately release their MEMBERSHIP tallies for how their membership voted bw @ewarren and @BernieSanders (which they did in 2016) \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\nThe last time the Wayback Machine shows a snapshot of Warren\u2019s daughter Amelia listed on the Demos Board of Trustees page was May of this year. pic.twitter.com/itUywpzJYQ \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\nI'd say $45K to @WorkingFamilies from Demos isn't exactly game-changing\u2026six figure checks are. But source familiar with WFP tells me the Demos $$ to WFP was a \"signal\" that there's more where that came from if WFP were to endorse Warren. \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\nIt should also be noted\u2014WFP itself was pushing the @BernieSanders supporters are sending harassing tweets and are \"racist\" after the @ewarren endorsement\u2026.without providing much evidence of such. This of course doesn't mean there wasn't isolated examples of volatile tweets \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\nBut WFP was itself pushing this with media outlets\u2014an odd thing to do publicly if you genuinely respect and appreciate @BernieSanders (as they said they do) and consider him to be your second choice. This was right out of @HillaryClinton and David Brock's playbook \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\n.@Demos_Org made $229,523 in grants for 2017-2018. The $45,000 in grants to @WorkingFamilies makes up 20% of their overall grants. That\u2019s a fairly significant amount for a donation-based organization. pic.twitter.com/uK2WEKJd6E \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 24, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"@WorkingFamilies should've disclosed this at time of its endorsement for Warren\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/warren-48fe65d7-9e1e-4cb3-a7da-dcdc6855db52.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
