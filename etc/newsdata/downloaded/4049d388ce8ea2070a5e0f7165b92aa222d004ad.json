Those are the same categories that an abortion clinic or pro-choice organization might use.\n\nAbortion clinics have exclusive rights to the \"abortion clinic\" category in Google Maps listings, and Google Maps verifies businesses that categorize themselves as \"abortion clinic.\" But Vice said that Google Maps has occasionally slipped in the verification process.\n\nA Google spokesperson provided Business Insider the following statement:\n\n\"We work hard to surface business results that are relevant, accurate, and help users find what they're looking for. We have policies in place against businesses that misrepresent themselves on Maps and when we become aware we respond to as quickly as possible. We also empower our users to report listings for correction or removal if they believe a business is misrepresenting itself or its services.\"\n\nGoogle told Vice that it deploys analysts to ensure that the categories used by businesses in their listings are accurate.\n\nGoogle was first found to deliver these inaccurate results in a February 2018 Gizmodo report, and Vice notes that Google has \"gotten better at differentiating abortion clinics\" since then.", "description": "The \"abortion clinic\" category in Google Maps is intended for clinics that offer the procedure, but other organizations are still showing up.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72cac02e22af3a9f561e03-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
