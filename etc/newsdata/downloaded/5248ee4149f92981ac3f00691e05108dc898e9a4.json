Holding the hearings behind closed doors in a SCIF\u2014a secure room designed for discussing classified information\u2014makes sense when questioning diplomats about national-security matters. (It also makes it harder for witnesses to coordinate their testimony.) House Republicans aren\u2019t being denied access to the sessions. So long as they sit on the relevant committees, they can and have participated in the inquiry. Nor is any of this novel. Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News legal analyst, noted on Thursday that Democrats were operating under rules established by former Speaker John Boehner in 2015. Under those same rules, House Republicans held multiple closed-door hearings to depose witnesses during the congressional Benghazi investigations.\n\nMore broadly, the resolution and the memo adopt some of the White House\u2019s talking points about the inquiry\u2019s legitimacy, albeit tepidly. They note that the House didn\u2019t vote to formally open an impeachment inquiry after Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement last month, as it had in the Nixon and Clinton impeachment sagas. That would give House Republicans the ability to subpoena witnesses of their own. The resolution also criticizes House investigators for denying Trump certain privileges enjoyed by Bill Clinton\u2019s legal team in 1998, including the ability to sit in on all depositions and question the witnesses themselves. House Democrats are reportedly planning public hearings next month that would ameliorate most of these concerns. Trump will have ample opportunities to defend himself during the Senate trial as well.\n\nThe resolution\u2019s concerns about the integrity of the impeachment process can\u2019t be separated from Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert that process. The Senate effectively becomes a court when it conducts an impeachment trial. A group of House lawmakers will serve as prosecutors; Trump\u2019s lawyers will act as defense attorneys. Chief Justice John Roberts will preside over it. And the senators themselves are the jurors. They will hear the evidence and testimony, deliberate amongst themselves, and then vote on whether the president is guilty or not guilty. Every senator knows the gravity of the situation. It will likely be the most important vote that many of them ever cast.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies aren\u2019t taking any chances. Just as they tried to box in Zelenskiy, so too are they now trying to box in Republican senators. Earlier this week, The Daily Beast reported that Trump recently fumed to his allies that the GOP\u2019s Senate majority hasn\u2019t defended him as enthusiastically as he wants. Most of that frustration, the report said, was directed at Graham and McConnell, who introduced Thursday\u2019s resolution. Trump wants his future jurors to pass judgment on the inquiry\u2014and his own actions, by extension\u2014before the House can finish or formally present their evidence.\n\nIn practical terms, this is an oblique form of jury tampering.\n\nIn practical terms, this is an oblique form of jury tampering. Those who vote in favor of the resolution will find it much harder to justify a vote to convict Trump later in the process. Those who vote against it, on the other hand, can expect the same treatment that Trump gave Utah Senator Mitt Romney earlier this month. After Romney criticized Trump for openly asking China to investigate Biden, Trump angrily denounced him on Twitter as a \u201cpompous ass.\u201d The Club for Growth also launched a $40,000 ad campaign in Utah that labeled Romney as a \u201cDemocrat secret asset.\u201d Forty grand and a handful of Trump tweets aren\u2019t likely to do any real damage to Romney\u2019s electoral hopes\u2014he isn\u2019t up for re-election for another five years. But it\u2019s an unmistakable warning shot, directed against any other Senate Republicans who might openly air their concerns about the president\u2019s misconduct.", "description": "Lacking any defense on the merits, the president wants his allies to delegitimize the impeachment inquiry\u2014and be seen doing it.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/172b7dfe81f85bcdd88b4ef3fb96b672208c9333.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
