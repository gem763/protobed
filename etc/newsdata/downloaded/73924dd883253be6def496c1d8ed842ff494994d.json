(TSX: PMN) (OTCQB: ARFXF), a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of antibody therapeutics targeting toxic oligomers implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, has identified several novel antibody candidates for Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), a severe, Parkinson\u2019s-like disease caused by toxic, misfolded forms of the protein alpha-synuclein. The new antibody candidates join ProMIS\u2019 strong pipeline of antibodies that demonstrate high selectivity for toxic misfolded proteins, implicated as a root cause of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\n\n\nOur preclinical in vitro studies indicate that antibody candidates targeting toxic forms of alpha-synuclein bind strongly to toxic alpha-synuclein aggregates derived from MSA-affected brain. The same antibodies protect cultured neurons from alpha-synuclein toxicity and spreading (propagation).\n\nMSA is a rare, progressive disorder caused by loss of nerve cells in the brain; it affects approximately15,000 people in the United States. Scientific studies indicate that toxic oligomers and small soluble fibrils, derived from naturally occurring alpha-synuclein, are a root cause of disease development and progression in MSA. No disease-modifying treatments exist in part because traditional drug development methods are unable to generate antibodies that can target with precision the neurotoxic forms of alpha-synuclein. The ProMIS platform is a novel, proprietary method for discovering and developing antibodies that can uniquely and precisely target highly toxic misfolded proteins, also called toxic oligomers or prions, while preserving normal forms of the protein and normal protein function. The platform not only generates high-quality antibody candidates but also delivers powerful, validated candidates in months versus years.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the ProMIS platform has demonstrated its unique ability to generate antibody candidates with the desired selectivity for toxic misfolded proteins and do so rapidly and cost-effectively,\u201d said Johanne Kaplan, Chief Development Officer at ProMIS Neurosciences. \u201cAs new biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases continue to emerge, the opportunity to advance\u2014with confidence\u2014potential therapies for these diseases is unprecedented. We\u2019ll continue to strengthen our existing programs, while continuing to discover and develop root cause therapies for the many protein misfolding diseases that have stymied the drug development community for decades.\u201d\n\nProMIS\u2019 new antibody candidates for MSA join a robust pipeline of antibody candidates that demonstrate selectivity for the toxic species arising from naturally occurring proteins in the brain. The pipeline includes:\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease:\n\nPMN310, an antibody clinical candidate that demonstrates best-in-class selectivity for the toxic oligomeric form of amyloid beta compared with other antibodies in development.\n\nPotential antibody candidates that selectively target the toxic form of tau\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease\n\n\n\nAntibody candidates showing best-in-class selectivity for toxic forms of alpha- synuclein compared to other therapeutic antibodies in development\n\nALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)\n\nAntibody candidates selectively targeting toxic forms of TDP43\n\nAntibody candidates selectively targeting toxic forms of SOD1\n\nTo learn more about MSA, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, new research supporting therapy development and the promise of new biomarkers, listen to the podcast, Saving Minds, at iTunes or Spotify .\n\nAbout ProMIS Neurosciences\n\nProMIS Neurosciences, Inc. is a development stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing antibody therapeutics selectively targeting toxic oligomers implicated in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The Company\u2019s proprietary target discovery platform is based on the use of two complementary thermodynamic, computational discovery engines -ProMIS and Collective Coordinates \u2013 to predict novel targets known as Disease Specific Epitopes on the molecular surface of misfolded proteins. Using this unique precision approach, the Company is developing novel antibody therapeutics for AD, ALS and PD. ProMIS is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, with offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
