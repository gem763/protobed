Underlying profits, which exclude this and other negative factors weighing on results, would rise, it said.\n\nNet1 bought into Cell C in 2017, when it paid 2 billion rand for a 15% stake in the carrier.\n\n($1 = 14.6648 rand)", "description": "Payments company Net1 UEPS Technologies said on Thursday it had written down to zero the value of its stake in South Africa's third-largest mobile network, Cell C, alongside the carrier's largest shareholder, Blue Label Telecoms.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
