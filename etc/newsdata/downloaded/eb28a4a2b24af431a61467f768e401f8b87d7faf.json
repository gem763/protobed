The speaker, John Bercow, took a sip from his water glass, and flicked a splash of its contents into his eyes.\n\nAbove his head, reporters rushed in to take their seats. Through the doors behind and in front of him, MPs swept in and on to the green benches.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe had let it be known he was making \u201ca statement\u201d. In the last tremorous year, interventions of this kind from the speakers chair have been rare but seismic.\n\nWe were hours away from Boris Johnson proroguing parliament, a move that has been quite rightly understood as an attempt to force through no-deal Brexit against the wishes of the House of Commons. Speaker Bercow had broken briefly from his holidays to call the matter a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d.\n\nIt had been speculated that he might be about to announce that he wouldn\u2019t go. That he\u2019d stay in the chair, all night and beyond, keeping parliament open, taking it rogue.\n\nIn the end, it was much more important than that, much more. The speaker\u2019s announcement was about by far the most important matter in the speaker\u2019s life \u2013 the speaker himself.\n\n\u201cColleagues...\u201d Pause. Bercow could not have tried harder to bear down upon the occasion with as much weight as his own personal gravity could muster. In the gaps between his words, Commons staff went on their lunch break and came back.\n\n\u201cI would like to make a personal statement to the house.\u201d Pause again. We can only speculate that it had been brought to the speaker\u2019s attention that somewhere in a far galaxy, a distant star was coming towards the last few hundred million years of its natural life cycle, and it was important that the subsequent supernova not be allowed to interrupt his moment.\n\n\u201cAt the 2017 election, I promised my wife and children that it would be my last. This is a pledge that I intend to keep.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

It was expelled again even sharper. Was that it? Yes it was. It was not to be entirely without drama, which may be the one human thing Bercow values above himself.\n\n\u201cIf the house votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends,\u201d he said.\n\nAh yes. The house was due to be having a vote on whether to have an election. That vote, which might have happened at about 11pm, was now going to be well in tomorrow, once the speaker\u2019s Very Urgent Business had been dealt with.\n\n\u201cIf the house does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me stand down at the close of business on Thursday 31 October.\u201d\n\nThis last-minute bit of chicanery served one purpose, which he then made clear. That there is almost certainly going to be a general election in November or December, and so it would be this parliament, not the next one that would elect a new speaker. Good luck getting a Brexiteer in this chair, in other words.\n\nIt was at this point, at this rarefied day at this rarefied hour in the life of the nation that Bercow found time, in a parliamentary schedule that was already full to beyond bursting point, for 90 minutes worth of tributes to himself.\n\nJeremy Corbyn went first. Then Michael Gove had a go. Various people applauded. There will, in the fullness of time, be a specific time in the parliamentary schedule allocated for tributes to the speaker. But on this occasion, all of them were taken as points of order, which means the speaker is required to respond to them all individually.\n\nBercow\u2019s eyes swelled. He glanced up at the rafters. Here was the House of Commons, talking in gushing terms about Bercow, spiked with the sound of Bercow\u2019s own voice. If he\u2019d dropped dead in this instant, it would not have taken the pathologists long to discover the deadly cocktail of substances involved. A Bercow speedball.\n\nJo Swinson... Dominic Grieve... Ian Paisley Junior... David Lammy. By the 90th minute of tributes it was hard to tell merely with the naked eye whether the speaker's chair itself had not risen from its dais and Bercow was now floating above the commons as if on a cherry picker above a festival crowd.\n\nAt some point, evidently, it had all got so much for him that he had briefly forgotten all of the many bullying and harassment allegations against him, the reports into his conduct that remain outstanding.\n\nSo much so, that when he had modestly brought the tributes to himself to an end after a mere hour and 40 minutes, he allowed himself the little indulgence of a 90-second bellowed peroration at the Tory backbenches, as it tried to object to a debate he had granted.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me young man, from a sedentary position, what I can and can\u2019t say!\u201d he shouted, at the very top of his voice, eyes a mile wide. The young man in question was either James Duddrige, 48, or Graham Stuart, 57, no one could tell which.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not interested, leave the chamber! Leave the chamber! I\u2019m not remotely interested in your pettifogging objection! The position is as I\u2019ve described it, and quite plainly young man, you can like it, or lump it!\u201d\n\nBercow\u2019s overdue but nevertheless premature exit means it is unclear whether various investigations in to his conduct will ever be completed.
