There's nothing wrong with saying it should be done through the Department of Justice, working with Ukrainians,\" he said.\n\nAnchor Bill Hemmer asked Schweizer about a FoxNews.com report that the fired prosecutor at the center of the Ukraine controversy said he was told to back off an investigation involving a natural gas firm that was linked to Hunter Biden.\n\nFORMER UKRAINE PRIME MINISTER SAYS COUNTRY MUST INVESTIGATE HUNTER BIDEN\n\nSchweizer said the prosecutor has said under oath in an Austrian court trial that he was \"pressured and later fired\" because of the Biden investigation, though other Ukrainians have contradicted that claim.\n\n\"The bottom line is this needs to be investigated. What we know for a fact is in Ukraine and in China, the only two countries where Joe Biden was point-person on U.S. foreign policy, his son cashed in big time in both countries,\" he pointed out.\n\nFox News obtained a copy of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s notes from his January 2019 interview with fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in which he claimed that his \u201cinvestigations stopped out of fear of the United States.\u201d\n\nRENEWED INTEREST IN JOE BIDEN\u2019S OFFICIAL TRIP TO CHINA IN 2013 WITH SON HUNTER\n\n\u201cMr. Shokin attempted to continue the investigations, but on or around June or July of 2015, the U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey R. Pyatt told him that the investigation has to be handled with white gloves which, according to Mr. Shokin, that implied 'do nothing,'\u201d the notes from the interview stated.\n\nThe notes also claimed Shokin was told Biden had held up U.S. aid to Ukraine over the investigation. Shokin was fired in April 2016, and his case was \u201cclosed by the current Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko,\u201d according to the notes.\n\nDespite his claims, Shokin, on both sides of the Atlantic, had been widely accused of corruption.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchweizer said it was \"ridiculous\" for Biden to claim recently to Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy that he had never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. A photo obtained by \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" showed Biden and his son Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter.\n\n\"It's a patently ridiculous position, and I think it's one of the reasons the Senate needs to look at this and we need to look at financial records and see the communications that Joe Biden had with Ukrainian and Chinese officials,\" he said.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "Author Peter Schweizer said Thursday on \"America's Newsroom\" that\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0son\u00a0and his role on the board of a Ukrainian\u00a0gas company must be investigated, calling Biden's denials of knowledge about his son's business dealings \"patently ridiculous.\"", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/schweizer-bidens-FOX.jpg"}
