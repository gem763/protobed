The Canadian dollar dropped on the statement, falling 0.4 per cent to $C1.3137 per US dollar at 10.05am on Wednesday in Toronto trading.\n\n\"Bank of Canada held its target overnight rate unchanged, as expected, but with a slightly more dovish tilt,\" Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank, said by email. \"While not entirely setting up a cut at its next meeting, this leaves open the door a bit further for a December cut.\"\n\nThe next rate decision is December 4.\n\nIn contrast, the central bank on Wednesday highlighted the impact of trade conflicts and uncertainty on global growth which officials said is hurting business investment, exports and commodity prices, even with global monetary easing.\n\nThe bank lowered its growth forecast for Canada to 1.7 per cent next year, from a July estimate of 1.9 per cent, and 1.8 per cent in 2021 from a previous projection of 2 per cent. It also forecast an outright decline in exports and business investment in the second half of this year, when growth is expected to average a sluggish 1.3 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, the level of economic output will be \"slightly lower\" at the end of 2021 than predicted in July.\n\nOfficials also noted -- in a rare reference to the Canadian dollar in a rate statement -- that \"despite\" lower commodity prices, the currency hasn't weakened against the US dollar and is actually stronger against other currencies.\n\nAt the same time, the central bank is projecting inflation will remain at the 2 per cent target over the projection horizon, in part because of a small downward revision to its estimates for potential growth and expectations the \"modest\" output gap -- primarily in oil-producing regions -- will narrow.\n\nGlobal financial conditions meanwhile have eased, helping offset the impact of growing trade uncertainty, officials said.\n\nThe Bank of Canada was more bullish on consumption and housing -- which is being fueled by a robust labor market -- with forecasts little changed or even higher for those sectors in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAnother source of future growth could be additional stimulus from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's re-elected Liberal government, which has promised to implement new spending and tax cuts next year.\n\nThe Bank of Canada \"will pay close attention to the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy -- notably consumer spending and housing activity -- as well as to fiscal policy developments\", policy makers said in the statement.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The key policy rate was held at 1.75pc for the eighth straight meeting, even as policymakers cut their growth forecasts for the next two years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4551%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_389%2C$y_126/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cbc4387cc8321f1feed6ebe95b25fd5a2e1122c7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
