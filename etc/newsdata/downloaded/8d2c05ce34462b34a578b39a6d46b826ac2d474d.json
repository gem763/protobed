Apologies are not enough when the true intent was solely to damage and cause harm. As a company, we will be taking legal action. This unethical behavior has to stop,\u201d he wrote, going on to tag Mr. O\u2019Donnell and MSNBC.\n\nThis was a reckless attempt to slander our family and smear a great company.

I shouldn\u2019t have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air.\u201d\n\nHe noted even Tuesday night that he hadn\u2019t seen the supposedly Kremlin-cosigned documents and an MSNBC producer later elaborated that Mr. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s source himself hadn\u2019t seen the purported papers either.\n\nAttorney Charles Harder, in a letter to NBC News executives posted online by the Daily Mail, called Mr. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s report demonstrably \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d and demanded that Mr. O\u2019Donnell and the network \u201cimmediately and prominently retract, correct and apologize for the aforementioned false and defamatory statements.\u201d\n\nMr. Harder said Mr. Trump\u2019s Deutsche Bank loans, supposedly co-signed by Kremlin oligarchs, had no such parties.\n\n\u201cThe only borrowers under these loans are Trump entities, and Mr. Trump is the only guarantor,\u201d Mr. Harder wrote. \u201cNumerous documents for each of these loans are also recorded, publicly available and searchable online.\u201d\n\nThis proves the \u201cactual malice\u201d required for public figures to win libel cases in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThus, actual malice can easily be proven based on your reckless disregard of the truth and unreasonable reliance on an alleged \u2018source\u2019 who you will not even identify in your story and likely is seeking to mislead you and the public for political reasons or other ulterior motives,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
