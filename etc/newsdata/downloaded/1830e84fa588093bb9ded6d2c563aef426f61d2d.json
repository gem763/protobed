We look forward to working with many of them.\n\n'The agreement will see Hays Travel acquire a total of 555 stores around the UK, providing re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former employees of Thomas Cook's retail operations who were made redundant.'\n\n'This is an extremely positive outcome, and we are delighted to have secured this agreement,' said Jim Tucker, a KPMG partner who was appointed joint special manager of Thomas Cook's retail division after the failure.\n\nPeople who booked with with Thomas Cook arrive back at Gatwick Airport on September 23\n\n'It provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street.'\n\nMr Tucker said the administrators would work with Hays to 'ensure a smooth transition of the store estate'.\n\nHe added: 'We are pleased to have achieved this in a short timeframe and in the context of a complex liquidation process, which is testament to a lot of hard work from a number of parties.'\n\nThomas Cook collapsed last month, stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in UK history.\n\nIn total, around 600,000 customers were left stranded following the collapse of the 178 year-old company less than three weeks ago.\n\nPeople stand outside the Peterborough headquarters of Thomas Cook on September 23\n\nThis included around 140,000 who had been due to return to Germany. The company's demise sparked 22,000 job losses worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile it has emerged that cyber-criminals have repeatedly attacked a Civil Aviation Authority website set up to refund Thomas Cook customers.\n\nCrooks are also trying to trick victims into giving personal details. The CAA must now refund 360,000 bookings for trips that were to be taken by 800,000 people.\n\nAround 100,000 applications have so far been made on the website. Sources close to the regulator estimate that up to 15 per cent of these are suspicious.", "description": "Sunderland-based Hays has already recruited 421 ex-Thomas Cook staff and has offered employment to more of the airline's personnel.
