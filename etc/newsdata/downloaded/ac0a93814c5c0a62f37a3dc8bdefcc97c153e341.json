Officers there initially gave him only ibuprofen to treat the immense pain caused by the gunshot wound.\n\n\"I feared I was going to die,\" Rolando told the Guardian, which withheld his full name due to threats against his life. \"I thought in this country, there is really good medical care... but I wasn't getting any treatment.\"\n\nRolando has routinely been a target for violence for his entire life, according to the Guardian. When he was a baby, his father was killed after resigning from the armed forces and becoming a supporter of the pro-indigenous movement. He said his mother died shortly after \"from the trauma.\"\n\nRolando was shot in the head by the same people who may have targeted his father\n\nWhen he was just a year old, Rolando was given to his neighbors to take care of him. He later became homeless and was frequently targeted by the people who he believes murdered his father, according to The Guardian.\n\nHe said that when he went to the police, they tortured him, placing nails in his hand and foot and burning his arms with hot knives.\n\nA detainee \u2014 not Ronaldo \u2014 stands in a cell at Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San Diego, California, U.S. May 18, 2018.

He said he fled to the US because police assaulted him instead of helping in the aftermath of the attack,\n\n\"Giving me an opportunity to be here is giving me an opportunity to stay alive,\" Rolando told the Guardian.\n\nAn ER doctor believed Rolando might have a brain hemorrhage. ICE gave him ibuprofen.\n\nWhile Rolando survived the shooting, he suffered crippling headaches and, at times, blood out of his eyes, ears, and nose. While in the detention center, he would also sometimes lose consciousness. One ER doctor noted in records obtained by the Guardian that Rolando might have a brain hemorrhage.\n\nDespite that, while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, he was offered limited access to medical care. His main form of treatment was ibuprofen, which also sometimes ran out.\n\nIn this June 9, 2017, file photo, a vehicle drives into the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego.

A spokesperson said in a statement that \"ICE is committed to ensuring that everyone in our custody receives timely access to medical services and treatment.\"\n\n\"Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment detainees arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay. All ICE detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to daily sick call and 24-hour emergency care.\"\n\nPeople walk into Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San Diego, California, U.S. May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nAdvocates have long raised concerns about access to adequate medical care in immigration detention facilities. Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, previously told Insider that screenings at facilities are often bare bone and that staff doesn't take complaints seriously, creating dangerous delays in providing care. She added that ibuprofen and water are often the standard prescriptions for illnesses across the board.\n\nRead more: Immigrant detention centers are dealing with mumps and chicken pox outbreaks, and thousands have been put into quarantine\n\nA 2018 Human Rights Watch report revealed woefully inadequate medical care in immigration detention facilities, citing evidence that \"subpar and dangerous practices including unreasonable delays, poor practitioner and nursing care, and botched emergency response,\" contributed to detainee deaths.\n\nOtay Mesa, in particular, has faced controversy. Detainees have alleged medical neglect and, just last week, a 37-year-old man from Cameroon died at the facility after suffering a brain hemorrhage.\n\nRolando may be deported back to Guatemala\n\nFollowing three requests from his attorneys, Rolando was finally released from ICE detention last month after paying a $5,000 bond, according to the Guardian.\n\nAl Otro Lado, the nonprofit legal services group where Rios is an attorney, reportedly footed the cost of the bond.\n\nDetainees are seen at Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San Diego, California, U.S. May 18, 2018.
