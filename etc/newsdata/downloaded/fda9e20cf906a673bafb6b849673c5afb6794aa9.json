Now imagine his supporting cast including Steph Curry and Draymond Green instead of Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris.\n\nRussell is also listed behind players like Kevin Love, Steven Adams, and De'Aaron Fox, all of whom weren't even in the same conversation to be an All-Star in 2018-19. Fox could make a major jump in his third NBA season, but the other two are not exactly in their prime. Russell's placement here is questionable at best.\n\n[RELATED: Shaun Livingston's perseverance constant throughout Warriors' dynastic run]\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other two Warriors listed are no surprise, as Draymond Green finds himself at No. 17, while Steph Curry is ranked the No. 4 overall player for 2019-20, sandwiched between James Harden and LeBron James.\n\nAll the predictions and opinions can finally be pushed to the side when the NBA regular season gets underway on Oct. 22.\n\nFour Warriors listed among Sports Illustrated Top 100 NBA players for 2020 originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "D'Angelo Russell is probably not where you'd expect him to be.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PbHXb2zXr3ADqGcWWz17Ow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.H3ZJBgGOs9ClNhlgS7QnA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/76dd73c1499ea4142bcd52f237a12381", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
