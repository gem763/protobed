Good cheese is made around the world, not just by the French,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\n\u201cI know lots of French people who work in cheese who know that fine cheeses are made in many different countries.\u201d\n\nSome of France\u2019s most popular cheeses such as Camembert and Roquefort did not even get a mention.\n\nOuest-France, one of the country\u2019s largest-circulation newspapers, expressed shock and shame at the results. \u201cSacrilege: only one of the 15 top-rated cheeses is French,\u201d it lamented.\n\nThe mighty names of the French cheese scene \u2013 Roquefort, Camembert, Brie, Comt\u00e9 \u2013 were nowhere to be seen among the best rated fermented delicacies.\n\nAccording to the judges, the best cheeses in the world for 2019 are;\n\n1. Organic Blue Cheese Rogue River Blue (USA)\n\n2. Nazionale del Parmigiano Reggiano Latteria Sociale Santo Stefano (Italy)\n\n3. Torta del Casar DOP Virgen del Prado (Spain)\n\n4. Pitchfork Cheddar (UK)\n\n5. Gruy\u00e8re AOP Premier Cru (Switzerland)\n\n6. Quintano (Italy)\n\n7. Gallus (Switzerland)\n\n8. Gruy\u00e8re AOP (Switzerland)\n\n8. Epoisses AOP (France)\n\n10. Mori No Cheese (Japan)\n\nFarrand said new cheeses were being produced in the most unlikely countries. \u201cThis year, a Japanese cheese was entered for the first time and came 10th. From a country where dairy products are not part of the traditional diet, this is quite an achievement and we were happy to see it.\u201d\n\nCheese has become more accepted in Japan, he said, because of the growing popularity of pizza topped with Mozzarella.", "description": "France's reputation for being the world's leading producer of superior cheeses has been surrendered to products from the U.S. and Britain.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/cheese-awards-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
