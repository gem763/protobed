REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nAfter finishing third in Sunday\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix, with his lead over team mate and now sole rival Valtteri Bottas reduced to 64 points, the Briton is finally in a position to wrap up the title.\n\nHamilton assured reporters he was in no hurry, however.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s never been a case of always wanting to rush things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Mexico is generally our worst race of the year because of the way our car is set up and it\u2019s going to be a tough one for us. The last few have been pretty shocking, even though we\u2019ve won the title there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate it (the decider) will be Mexico. I think we will be battling for a good few races.\u201d\n\nHamilton won his 2017 and 2018 titles at Mexico City\u2019s Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, which returned to the calendar in 2015 for the first time in 23 years.\n\nThere is no real doubt about who will be champion, just a case of when.\n\n\u201cLewis will win it. Doesn\u2019t matter which race. I don\u2019t think it matters for him, does it? It wouldn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d said Ferrari\u2019s four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, second on Sunday.\n\nWith four races remaining, there are 104 points to be won when the extra point available for fastest lap is taken into consideration.\n\nAfter Mexico on Oct. 27 it will be 78 and then, following Texas a weekend later, 52.\n\nHamilton needs to score 14 points more than Bottas in Mexico but he has done that only once this season \u2014 in Hungary when he won and the Finn was eighth.\n\nMercedes, who clinched the constructors\u2019 title for the sixth year in a row on Sunday, have had eight one-two finishes in 17 races.\n\nHamilton and Bottas finished fourth and fifth in Mexico last year. In 2017, the champion was ninth while his team mate was second but in 2016 the Briton won in Mexico City.\n\nThe team\u2019s worst race of 2019 so far was Germany, with Hamilton ninth and Bottas a non-finisher.\n\nWhile Bottas celebrated his third victory of the season on Sunday, he is up against a man who has scored for 29 races in a row and been on the podium in all but three this year.\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen has won in Mexico for the past two years and Ferrari are also expected to be strong, so the maths would favour Texas as a more likely title-decider from the North American double-header.\n\nHamilton clinched his 2015 title in Austin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping for a better weekend but I think it\u2019s going to be very hard to beat the Ferraris with those long straights,\u201d the Briton said of Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe have no hope of getting by on those straights, that\u2019s for sure but even if you look at the others, the McLarens are picking up some serious speeds on the straights, so are the Red Bulls so I think it will be a tricky one.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton expects he will have to wait beyond Mexico, the next race on the calendar and one that could be a struggle for his Mercedes team, to secure his sixth Formula One world championship.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440773830&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1BZ", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
