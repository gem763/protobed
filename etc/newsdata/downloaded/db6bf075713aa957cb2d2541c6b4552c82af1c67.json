They should investigate the Bidens because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed and all these companies, and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine. So I would say with President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend they start an investigation into the Bidens, because nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s calling on a foreign government to investigate a political opponent is currently why Democrats are investigating him for potential impeachment. When Trump was asked at a Wednesday press conference what he wanted Zelensky to do, the president melted down.\n\nTrump has been focused on the fact that Hunter Biden received a $50,000-a-month job on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and that his father, who was vice president at the time, helped to push out a prosecutor who was investigating the firm for corruption.\n\nTrump has also raised accusations of corruption over Hunter Biden\u2019s partnership with a Chinese private equity fund, exaggerating the scale of China\u2019s investment from $4.2 million to $1.5 billion.\n\nPresident Trump speaks to the media on Thursday before leaving for Florida.

The prosecutor had previously investigated a Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden sat. But the allegations against the company, Burisma Holdings, predated the younger Biden\u2019s appointment to the board, which was described as an effort to provide international oversight in the notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy industry, and a Ukrainian prosecutor cleared the Bidens of any wrongdoing.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s efforts, which were not secret, formed the basis of a complex conspiracy theory advanced by Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and echoed by Trump himself. One potential embarrassment arose Thursday when CNN reported on a February 2016 letter to the Ukrainian president urging the same reforms being pushed at the same time by Biden \u2014 signed by members of the \u201cSenate Ukraine Caucus,\u201d including Republicans Rob Portman of Ohio, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, as well as several Democrats.\n\nTrump has been talking up the allegations about Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings with China for some time. The Washington Post reported last week that the president had raised the matter with Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, who has been working as an intermediary in trade talks with China.\n\nAccording to a video obtained by the Post, Trump alleged that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from the Chinese and asked Schwarzman, \u201cSteve, is that possible?\u201d Trump said he asked Schwarzman how that could happen, to which Schwarzman said: \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t get involved; you know it\u2019s very political.\u201d", "description": "Under the threat of impeachment over his request for Ukraine to look for damaging information about Joe Biden and his son Hunter, President Trump on Thursday called on China to also investigate the former vice president.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KfySk2LwPgFKNjfoHA6jHA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/e6664b90-e5f6-11e9-b35f-78c886124e6c", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
