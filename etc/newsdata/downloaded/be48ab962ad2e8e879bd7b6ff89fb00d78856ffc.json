The company nodded to newer entrants like DoorDash and Uber Eats and wrote that competition \u201chad a 300+ [basis point] impact on our growth rate for the third quarter.\u201d\n\nIn the company\u2019s conference call, GrubHub\u2019s management subsequently said that \u201cgrowth had deviated noticeably from where we thought it was going to be\u201d in the quarter.\n\nAnalysts were extremely bearish on the results, with at least three firms lowering their ratings and others slashing their price targets. The average target currently stands at about $76, according to date compiled by Bloomberg, down from $87 over the weekend.\n\nWhile investors had been bracing for a weak outlook, Wedbush wrote, \u201cit certainly was not at this order of magnitude.\u201d BTIG added, \u201cwe struggle to find any silver lining in these developments.\u201d\n\nThere was also caution around GrubHub\u2019s plan to invest aggressively in order to protect its market share. While there is a business case to be made for this, Stephens wrote, it \u201csignificantly pushes out the earnings story and again sets up GRUB as a \u2018show me\u2019 stock for 2020.\u201d\n\nShares plunged 42% in their biggest one-day drop ever, with the stock trading at its lowest since April 2017. With the decline, the stock has dropped more than 70% from a peak in September 2018.\n\nHere\u2019s what analysts are saying about the results:\n\nOppenheimer, Jason Helfstein\n\nGrubHub usage is \u201ceroding,\u201d and this trend is \u201cexpected to worsen\u201d in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn order to compete, GrubHub \u201cwill now focus on lower margin features.\u201d There is \u201climited investor demand with slowing growth and declining Ebitda.\u201d\n\nDowngrades to underperform from outperform; price target cut to $34 from $91.\n\nBofA, Nat Schindler\n\nDowngrades by two notches, to underperform from buy. Price target slashed to a Street-low view of $30 from $98.\n\n\u201cThe food delivery market is increasingly irrational as competitors flood the market,\u201d making customers less loyal to any particular company. The company\u2019s \u201canswer to this irrationality, however, seems confusing: its management letter seems to suggest that it will double down on its competitors\u2019 poor economic decisions,\u201d including free delivery for quick service restaurants.\n\nThese strategies \u201cshould attract customers with lower order frequency and less lifetime value, reducing [long-term] profitability while providing little real growth.\u201d\n\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group, Alex Fuhrman\n\nThe outlook \u201ccreates a bleaker picture in the short-term.\u201d\n\nDecelerating revenue growth, along with Ebitda pressures, \u201ccreates a challenged environment for the stock, with investors now likely needing to see a stabilization in revenue growth coupled with improved profitability.\u201d\n\nDowngrades to hold from buy, price target cut to $40 from $100.\n\nJefferies, Brent Thill\n\nThe weaker-than-expected third-quarter results are \u201cthe least of the issues,\u201d given the \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d outlook and the \u201caggressive spending\u201d to reinvigorate growth. The spending plan \u201cmakes sense given the circumstance,\u201d but \u201cthere is no guarantee that it will change the overall narrative.\u201d\n\nThe company \u201chas turned into a revenue deceleration story with compressing margins all in the face of increased competition, not a great recipe for success.\u201d Expects increased consolidation in the food-delivery sector, but this is \u201ca challenging industry to truly differentiate (especially against two deep-pocketed competitors).\u201d\n\nHold rating, price target cut to $45 from $78.\n\nStephens, Will Slabaugh\n\nThere is a business case to be made for increasing investments in order to protect market share, but \u201cthis significantly pushes out the earnings story and again sets up GRUB as a \u2018show me\u2019 stock for 2020.\u201d\n\nCurrently has an overweight rating and $110 price target, but the view is under review.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- GrubHub Inc. shares plummeted to their lowest level in more than two years on Tuesday, after the food-delivery company gave a fourth-quarter outlook that was well below expectations, as intensifying competition and \u201cpromiscuous\u201d customers weighed on growth trends.\u201cNewer diners are increasingly", "authors": ["Ryan Vlastelica"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AFFcA39F5stuKQHYeGvJJg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/7f2b97ae23729b1ff8ce1900008d7340", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
