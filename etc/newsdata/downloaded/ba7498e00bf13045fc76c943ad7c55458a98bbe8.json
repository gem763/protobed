If there are an equal number of successful kicks, the competition moves to 'sudden death', following the same order of kickers used for the previous five kicks until one player succeeds with a kick and the other misses from the same position.\"\n\nOnly three knockout games in tournament history have finished drawn after 80 minutes - including, peculiarly, two finals, in 1995 and 2003.\n\nThere has never been a kicking competition at the tournament, but a similar method was used to decide a Heineken Cup semi-final in 2008.\n\nOn that occasion, Leicester Tigers emerged victorious over the Cardiff Blues, with number eight Jordan Crane slotting the winning kick after Martyn Williams had missed for the Welsh side.", "description": "England Rugby are looking to reach their first Rugby World Cup\u00a0final since 2007 as they face two-time defending champions New Zealand Rugby.
