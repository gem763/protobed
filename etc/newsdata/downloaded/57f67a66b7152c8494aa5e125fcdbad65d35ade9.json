Among those alleged problems is the \u201ccollege completion\u201d crisis. If too low a percentage of enrolled students obtain a credential attesting that they completed some degree or program, then something must be done!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe assumption here is that if a student doesn\u2019t \u201ccomplete\u201d then he has failed \u2014 or the system has failed him. But as Shannon Watkins shows in today\u2019s Martin Center article, that assumption is very shaky, at least with regard to community college students. That\u2019s because many of them are interested in just a few courses that fill their needs or interests. If they get the skills or knowledge they want from those courses, continuing on to get a completion credential is a waste of time and money.\n\nWatkins writes, \u201cIn their analyses of why students don\u2019t finish their studies, policymakers overlook an important subset of the community college population: students who want to take a few courses, but who don\u2019t intend to earn a credential or transfer. These students, sometimes referred to as \u2018skills builders\u2019 or \u2018upskillers,\u2019 only take the few specific courses they need to gain new skills for employment or to advance in their careers. Skills builders commonly take courses that train students in specific work-related fields such as information technology or business management.\u201d\n\nShe cites research by University of Michigan professor Peter Bahr to support that contention. His work shows that \u201cupskillers\u201d often succeed in raising their compensation levels by far more than the cost of the courses they took.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatkins concludes, \u201cPolicymakers should discard their narrow \u2014 and superficial \u2014 view of community colleges\u2019 mission. People attend community colleges for a wide number of reasons: to explore their interests, to figure out whether college is for them, to earn credits toward a four-year degree, to earn a workforce credential, or simply to gain new, specific skills. It\u2019s time that these leaders recognize that only some of those goals fit into the current \u2018must complete\u2019 narrative.\u201d\n\nYes, but that would be letting a crisis go to waste.", "description": "The assumption here is that if a student doesn't \"complete\" then he has failed -- or the system has failed him.", "authors": ["George Leef", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
