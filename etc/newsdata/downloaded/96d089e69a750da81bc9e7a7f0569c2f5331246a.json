Unknown to his second wife, he had begun spending a lot of time each week at our house near the bayou where my grandmother, mother and I lived. A gardener, he planted his remorse in the soil where it blossomed into a lemon tree and then a fig tree, and then a plum, orange, peach and apple, all lined up in a colored row behind our garage.\n\n\u201cThey always come back,\u201d my mother said as my grandfather gardened. \u201cThey always realize their wrongs.\u201d\n\nBut I was far more concerned about the origin of what appeared to me to be a disturbing and seemingly unavoidable pattern in choosing the wrong men.", "description": "A long line of absentee fathers taught me a lesson in love that was hard to undo.
