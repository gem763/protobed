However, there are other good reasons to stick to a plant-based diet.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n\nA vegan man in Australia has spoken out after a local Domino's restaurant seemed to have accidentally served ham on what he thought was a plant-based pizza, according to Daily Mail Australia.\n\nPatrick Hukins, who has been vegan for four years, said he felt sick to his stomach and betrayed after the supposed mix-up. He had finished his meal after double-checking with employees that it was indeed plant-based, and became ill shortly after.\n\nAfter Hukins complained via social media with photo evidence of what he said was real meat, Domino's apologized and offered the man a voucher, though it was only enough to pay for a traditional, non-vegan, pie, according to the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I felt shame and pain for the animal. And felt guilt for having unknowingly consumed a product that goes against my endeavors to reduce my environmental footprint as well as harm to other animals ... I was shocked,\" Hukins told the Daily Mail.\n\nRead more: A vegan said she was 'poisoned for life' after accidentally eating meat. Here's the reality of what happens when you stop being vegan.\n\nThere's a wealth of evidence that a mostly plant-based diet is best for your health, as well as the environment. But even if you've been vegan for many years, becoming an accidental carnivore for one meal is unlikely to do lasting damage or even make you sick, although it may be very upsetting.\n\nHere's what actually happens when you stop being vegan, involuntarily or otherwise, according to a registered dietitian.\n\nEating meat after abstaining for years is rarely dangerous but could cause mental and physical reactions\n\nMost of the time, when a vegan or vegetarian starts eating meat after a long period of abstaining, what happens is ... nothing, according to Robin Foroutan, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nSome people may feel as though they have a harder time digesting meat if they aren't used to it, Foroutan said, but there's no scientific evidence for this.\n\nThere could also be a psychological element at play if people become anxious or even have a panic attack when they realize what they're eating, Foroutan said. \"Distress could be one cause of that kind of response,\" she said.\n\nIt's also possible that some vegans have a food sensitivity to meat, causing symptoms like headaches, bloating or gassiness, heartburn, or irritability. While food sensitivities are vague and poorly understood, they're believed to be a result of the wide variation in people's bodies and digestive systems. Eating specific foods may trigger inflammation or antibodies in some people.\n\nAllergies to any type of meat are possible but uncommon, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Unlike a food sensitivity, a food allergy can be consistently diagnosed with a type of test to detect the presence of immunoglobulin, which is created by the immune system reacting to the allergen.\n\nA particularly dangerous type of meat allergy can develop from an insect bite. People bitten by the Lone Star tick can become allergic to red meat and animal products, which could cause a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. This tick is found in the US, mostly in southeastern states.", "description": "Accidentally eating meat can be upsetting, but in most cases it won't cause any physical harm, a nutritionist told Insider.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kthbe6bxSeP0bzoj_YDgEQ--~B/aD02Njc7dz04ODk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/a3ad28a345d66d7e65277d7cfd7d3b6b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
