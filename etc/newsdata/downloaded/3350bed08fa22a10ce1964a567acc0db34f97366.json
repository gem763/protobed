He\u2019s the only one to have that honour.\u201d\n\nKalwaria is one of the most significant sites of Catholic pilgrimage in Europe. Its huge 17th-century church and chapels, forming a route modelled on Christ\u2019s passion, were a favourite destination of the \u201cPolish pope\u201d, who grew up in nearby Wadowice.\n\nFrom the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, the baroque basilica of St Mary\u2019s looks down on a compact community of 5,000 people, which has a reputation for making fine household furniture.\n\nAlthough he belongs to a small, rural party, Ormanty, 65, is a loyal and passionate supporter of Poland\u2019s controversial Law and Justice government, which has a strong chance of winning a second term in office after next Sunday\u2019s general election. Another photograph on his wall shows the mayor with Andrzej Duda, the Law and Justice stalwart who was elected president in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented what is being done on social welfare,\u201d he says. \u201cThis has gone not just to families, the government is taking care of the disabled and the elderly too. Last month we opened a new centre for the disabled which is helping 30 residents.\u201d\n\nOrmanty believes that, beyond economics, Law and Justice are fighting the good fight in the battle to defeat the secular liberal values that have corrupted western European nations and which are threatening to do the same in Catholic Poland.\n\nOn the mayor\u2019s desk, a small collection of books includes a volume by his brother, a distinguished priest. There is also a work entitled: \u201cThe Destructive \u2018Equality\u2019 of the LBGTQ ideology; allegedly anti-discriminatory and progressive policies as instruments of discrimination and destruction.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Bernardine monastery of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska. Photograph: Pegaz/Alamy\n\nFor Ormanty and in much of Poland, this is the hot topic of the day. Four years ago, when Law and Justice swept to power, winning the first outright parliamentary majority in the post-communist era, they did so partly through exploiting Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. The party\u2019s chairman and most influential figure, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, pledged to shut Polish borders to an alleged 100,000 Muslim refugees who, he said, would seek to impose sharia law in the country.\n\nThis time around, LGBT rights seem to have been chosen as a useful anti-liberal battleground on which the party \u2013 and its clerical supporters \u2013 can show off their conservative credentials. At a \u201cpatriotic\u201d conference organised by the lay group Catholic Action last spring, Kaczy\u0144ski described LGBT rights and \u201cgender theory\u201d as a \u201cthreat to the nation\u201d. Across the country, Pride-style marches have been condemned, contested and banned. Where they have taken place, counter-demonstrations have turned violent. No one knows how many people have been the target of homophobic attacks because there is no hate-crime category in which they could be recorded. The atmosphere has turned toxic.\n\nLast month, Ormanty tried to persuade Kalwaria\u2019s council to adopt a resolution stating that \u201cgay ideology\u201d was \u201cannihilating Christian values\u201d and declaring the town an \u201cLGBT-free zone\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about individuals, it\u2019s about the ideology,\u201d he says. \u201cThose people who demonstrate their sexuality openly are in effect attacking the church \u2026 I am a believer and a practising person, like most Poles: we have been baptised and we are believers, and therefore our goal is salvation. You achieve salvation by living a holy life, in line with the 10 commandments, and the commandment of love. The wellbeing of our children and grandchildren is at stake, because the equality movements blaspheme things we hold sacred.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s anti-LGBT resolution was rejected by the council in favour of a milder one pledging to protect the \u201ctraditional family\u201d. But similar motions have gone through elsewhere, contributing to an alarming sense of polarisation ahead of next week\u2019s poll.\n\nPoland is bitterly divided between Catholic conservatives, who dominate small towns like Kalwaria and the rural areas, and secular liberals, who hold sway in the big cities such as Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. The old, the less-educated and the less-wealthy are more likely to vote for Law and Justice. Wealthier Poles and the young gravitate to the liberal Civic Platform coalition or the leftwing United Left.\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher. The bullying and marginalisation of LGBT activists is only the latest example of the enthusiasm with which Law and Justice, with a certain version of God on its side, has flouted liberal democratic norms. The charge sheet drawn up by liberal opponents is long: the independence of the Polish judiciary has been undermined and judges friendly to the rightwing agenda placed in key positions; the country\u2019s public media has been ruthlessly exploited to brazenly promote the government\u2019s agenda; women\u2019s reproductive rights have been relentlessly targeted; corruption scandals involving public money have been frequent; the director of one of Poland\u2019s most important museums was frozen out after being accused of staging an \u201canti-Polish\u201d exhibition on antisemitism. The government\u2019s refusal to form a lay commission to investigate revelations of paedophilia in the church has been judged a cynical cover-up on behalf of a crucial ally.\n\nThe allegations and condemnations have piled up at home and abroad, not least from the European Commission in Brussels. Yet the Law and Justice party continues to poll close to 20 points ahead of Civic Platform, the liberal coalition of parties that lost power in 2015. If the combined vote of the opposition parties beats Law and Justice next Sunday, there is a chance that an alternative government could be formed. But the smart money is on four more years of religious nationalism.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Law and Justice party chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski greets nuns in Warsaw. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nBy the standards of the Polish church, Father Jacek Prusak, a Jesuit priest and professor at the Ignatian Academy in Krak\u00f3w, could be considered a turbulent priest. He is one of a small minority of clerics willing to challenge the hand-in-glove cooperation of church and state under the present dispensation. But he warns against a simplistic reading of Law and Justice as a purely rightwing and reactionary phenomenon. \u201cThey do not conform to traditional left-right divisions,\u201d says Prusak. \u201cIt\u2019s culturally rightwing and economically leftwing. The welfare policies can be seen as within the spirit of Catholic social teaching.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, religion, he says \u201cis being used as a weapon in Law and Justice\u2019s culture wars. The party picks the aspects of church teaching that it prefers. Take refugees, for example. Look at what Pope Francis says about the need to welcome and help refugees and compare that to the Law and Justice approach. And as far as LGBT issues are concerned, when I preach, I preach about the gospel, and in the gospel there is no mention of homosexuality.\u201d\n\nWhat Law and Justice is trying to do, says Prusak, with the complicity of much of the established church, \u201cis equate being Polish with being a good Catholic. And a good Catholic Pole will be a loyal Law and Justice supporter. This is the politicisation of the church; it\u2019s reducing the church to a tribal vision.\u201d\n\nIt is also, say the government\u2019s many critics, an authoritarian vision. In campaign rallies, Kaczy\u0144ski likes to talk about \u201cdecent Poles\u201d; the right-thinking, Catholic types on whose behalf Law and Justice fearlessly governs. In this majoritarian world, civic pluralism and protecting the rights of minorities are not priorities.\n\nThe palpable fear among liberals and on the left is that a second term for Law and Justice will irrevocably entrench its power within the institutions of civil society. Last week, Gazeta Wyborcza, the newspaper which made its name in the Solidarity era, published a special supplement entitled The Black Book of PiS (Law and Justice). \u201cHow Poland became one political party\u2019s loot.\u201d According to the sociologist Rados\u0142aw Markowski, who has been a thorn in the side of the Law and Justice administration, \u201cpopulism is a lazy catch-all description of this. This is authoritarian clientelism.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pope John Paul II\u2019s visits Kalwaria Zebrzydowska in 1979. Photograph: Wojciech Kry\u0144ski/FORUM/Alamy\n\nBut opposition parties seeking to oust Law and Justice from office find themselves faced with an uncomfortable truth. The government may be authoritarian, but it is also popular. For four years it has undeniably shown a striking commitment to the less wealthy. Among huge numbers of Poles on modest incomes, it is seen as that rare thing: a political party that kept its promises.\n\nPiotr Janusiewicz is the Law and Justice-backed president of the town council in Kalwaria and the headmaster of the local secondary school. He says the impact of social spending has been \u201cdecisive\u201d.\n\nIn power, Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s party claims to have overseen the biggest redistribution of wealth in Poland since the end of communism in 1989. Its flagship 500 Plus programme gives parents a monthly subsidy of \u00a3103 (500 z\u0142oty) for their second child and the same for every subsequent addition to the family. Low-income parents receive the same, life-changing, amount for their first child.\n\n\u201cAt my school, I have seen the transformation of the 500 Plus at first-hand,\u201d says Janusiewicz. \u201cA family with three children has \u00a3310 more each month. Imagine the difference that makes. Families are going on holiday more. Parents can afford to send their children to scout camps and extra-curricular activities. The clothes that pupils from the poorer families wear are of better quality.\u201d Voluntary donations used to be collected at the school to provide financial assistance and meals to the poorest pupils. \u201cWe closed the fund,\u201d says Janusiewicz. \u201cIt\u2019s not needed any more. Self-esteem has been restored to those people in need.\u201d\n\nThe 500 Plus strategy was presented as a patriotic, nation-building solution to Poland\u2019s declining birth-rate. It also ticked the Catholic pro-family box and made a point about priorities in a country where same-sex marriage is illegal and gay adoption off the agenda. Critics described it as a transparent bribe to win votes. But the most concrete net effect has been to lift hundreds of thousands of Poles out of poverty.\n\nNo one gave anything to help families like us before. Ewelina Gastol, mother of two\n\nState pensions have also been boosted. The retirement age has been lowered and the minimum wage raised. In a second term in office, Law and Justice has promised to double the minimum wage by 2023, distribute annual cash bonuses to pensioners, boost farming subsidies and invest heavily in improving transport in the provinces and rural areas.\n\nThe huge level of state spending appears to have boosted rather than damaged Poland\u2019s finances. Levels of private consumption have gone up significantly, fuelling a stellar growth rate last year of 5.1%, which far outstrips the eurozone. This, according to the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, is what \u201cPolish capitalism\u201d looks like, in contrast to the austerity version on offer elsewhere in the EU. During the summer, Kaczy\u0144ski told a summer rally of supporters that the \u201csystem that existed before, where the fruits of growth were not equally divided \u2026 has in large part been corrected.\u201d\n\nEwelina Gastol, a 33-year-old nurse and mother of two small children, lives in the village of Kryspin\u00f3w, near Krak\u00f3w. She says that the new money available has changed things for her and her husband, a fireman. \u201cFinally I can afford to pay for a creche. And since we had a second baby, I\u2019ve been able to put some of the extra money into a fund for the children for when they grow up,\u201d she says. Other parents at the local primary school have enthusiastically signed their children up for hip-hop dance classes and other extracurricular activities that would previously have been the province of the better-off.\n\nHaving criticised Law and Justice\u2019s plans as unaffordable, opposition parties have now pledged to maintain the 500 Plus programme and made their own commitments to greater welfare spending. But Civic Platform in particular faces a credibility gap. Why, when it ran Poland between 2007 and 2014 \u2013 and the current president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, was prime minister \u2013 did it fail to deliver anything remotely similar?\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gastol is thinking of voting for Law and Justice next week: \u201cNo one gave anything to help families like us before. And when you look at the political alternatives, well, there don\u2019t seem to be any you could trust.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest LGBT campaigner Magda Dropek.\n\nNext week, Magda Dropek, an LGBT activist, will stand for election in Krak\u00f3w. Running on the United Left slate, which stands at about 14% in polls, Dropek, 37, has spent the past few weeks dividing her time between campaigning and organising small-town outreach for the Krak\u00f3w-based Equality Foundation. For obvious reasons, she is no fan of Law and Justice. But she believes the Polish left can learn from the party\u2019s economic policies. \u201cIt has to be acknowledged that they are the ones who have given money to ordinary people. They have given dignity back to a lot of people who have been forgotten in the decades of economic transformation.\u201d That said, Dropek has spent 10 years fighting tooth and nail against the Catholic conservativism that Law and Justice stands for. Last month, that mission took her to Kalwaria\u2019s community centre.\n\nWhen Mayor Ormanty took his \u201cLGBT-free\u201d resolution to the council in the summer, Dropek\u2019s foundation raised some money to place a colourful billboard poster in Kalwaria\u2019s town centre. Featuring a pair of clasped hands and a rainbow wristband, it read simply: \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Within hours, it had been torn down. Then when she found out that the mayor had organised a conference at the community centre on the LGBT \u201cthreat\u201d, Dropek decided to go along. The conference, predictably enough, was attended by priests and a few politicians and supporters of Law and Justice. \u201cBut what was really shocking,\u201d she says, \u201cwas the number of teachers present, including the schools superintendent for the Krak\u00f3w region.\u201d\n\nLaw and Justice believes Poland has a historic mission to re-evangelise the world \u2013 it\u2019s based on a myth. Jacek Prusak, priest\n\nDropek was determined to be polite and constructive, so during the meeting she held her tongue. But eventually she could take no more. \u201cI stood up to say, \u2018I am a person, not an ideology, and I\u2019m very hurt by this discussion\u2019. I asked the mayor if my group could organise an event in the centre and talk to people from the town.\n\n\u201cAt first he wouldn\u2019t respond. Then he said: \u2018You have to understand that this is a very special place. John Paul II is an honorary citizen here.\u2019 Then a priest told me the talk was not directed at people but at an \u2018ideology\u2019 which was contrary to Catholic values. Other members of the audience said they could help me change my sexuality if I was willing to try. One man asked me if I was aware what Lenin did with people like me.\u201d\n\nBoth Dropek\u2019s parents are devout Catholics but are appalled by the homophobic language of the government and its powerful allies in the church. \u201cThe government and the church give permission through their rhetoric to the far-right nationalists and the football ultras who are attacking LGBT people. My mother is frightened on my behalf.\u201d\n\nLast month the archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, Marek J\u0119draszewiski, issued a pastoral letter to be read out at all of Krakow\u2019s many churches. \u201cThe next great threat to our freedom has appeared,\u201d writes the archbishop. When a child succumbs to LGBT ideology, \u201cfor a parent there is no bigger tragedy\u201d.\n\nWhen Law and Justice was elected four years ago, she tried to be optimistic on her Facebook page: \u201cCome on!\u201d she wrote: \u201cCan they really destroy everything in four years?\u201d As bad as those years have been, she believes they have also acted as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, and places her faith in the young people, gay and straight, who she sees on the equality marches in Krak\u00f3w. \u201cThey\u2019re not old enough to vote now, but they will be in four years. They\u2019re raised on Netflix shows and they really don\u2019t know what the fuss is about. Equality is just normality for them. That\u2019s what the future looks like.\u201d\n\nFather Jacek Prusak also believes that this golden moment for Catholic nationalism in Poland has a demographic sell-by date. \u201cLaw and Justice believes Poland has a historic mission to re-evangelise the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s based on a myth. To equate Poland with Catholicism may have been valid in the postwar period, but it wasn\u2019t the case before the second world war, when Poland was a multicultural, multi-faith country. And it isn\u2019t valid now, when statistics show that the under-21 age group is secularising at the fastest rate in the world. The \u2018Catholic Poland\u2019 that Law and Justice try to exploit for their own ends will prove to have been a historical reality for a very limited period of time.\u201d\n\nFor those who fear that Poland\u2019s bitter divides have reached crisis point, that will be a consoling thought. But in the short-term, it seems probable that Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s brand of Catholic nationalism will be given four more years to make Poland a country fit for \u201cdecent Poles\u201d.\n\nLaw and Justice\u2019s rise to power\n\n2001\n\nThe party is founded by the Kaczy\u0144ski twins, Lech and Jaros\u0142aw, as an overtly Christian party of the centre-right. The move signals the break-up of the old Solidarity movement which won power from the communist regime in 1989. In the same year the liberal-conservative wing of Solidarity forms the Civic Platform party, as Polish politics begins to divide along lines familiar in western democracies. The left is represented by the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance.\n\n2005\n\nLaw and Justice wins parliamentary elections and Lech Kaczy\u0144ski is elected president. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski serves as prime minister, but calls early elections following a corruption scandal. The 2007 poll is won by Civic Platform, although Lech Kaczy\u0144ski remains president.\n\nThe current president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, is appointed prime minister. Tusk serves a second term after Civic Platform wins again in 2011. He pursues liberal economic policies and pledges to take Poland into the eurozone. Law and Justice begins to position itself on the nationalist right.\n\n2010\n\nLech Kaczy\u0144ski dies in a plane crash during a failed landing attempt by a Polish air force jet in Russia. His wife is also killed, along with the 94 other passengers. In Poland a week of mourning is declared.\n\n2015\n\nLaw and Justice becomes the first party to win a parliamentary majority since the fall of communism, after campaigning on a nationalist, socially conservative platform. Its backing comes mainly from smaller towns and rural areas. Beata Szyd\u0142o, a coalminer\u2019s daughter, is appointed prime minister and launches a lavish social spending programme. During its term of office the party is censured by the European Union for failing to abide by European democratic norms.", "description": "The rightwing Law and Justice party may be authoritarian and anti-LGBT, but its welfare programmes have transformed the lives of low-income Poles", "authors": ["Julian Coman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92596532fd72c0c333945a75c9bdd39d8ec57ea5/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84e1ea6cf549b53762b18e0c09711d07", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
