That\u2019s right\u2014invisible tributaries! The agencies even claim \u201ctributaries\u201d exist where remote sensing and other desktop tools indicate a prior existence of bed, banks, and [ordinary high-water marks], where these features are no longer present on the landscape today.\n\nThe rule would have made it possible to regulate \u201cwaters\u201d that were, in effect, dry land, such as a depression in land that holds water a few days a year after heavy precipitation.\n\nThen there\u2019s the \u201cwe will know a regulated water when we see it\u201d aspect of the rule. If waters didn\u2019t fall under specific categories as listed in the rule, then the Obama rule created a backup plan to help ensure the agencies could still have the ability to regulate additional waters.\n\nThe rule made it possible for the agencies to regulate some waters on a case-by-case basis if they decided that the water had a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d to certain regulated waters.\n\nA property owner couldn\u2019t have known what this would cover, because such determinations would have been at the subjective whim of agency officials.\n\nThat\u2019s particularly problematic because the Clean Water Act has both civil and criminal penalties.\n\nThe ongoing vagueness problem with the Clean Water Act is a concern that the Supreme Court has repeatedly brought up, including then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who stated in 2016 in the oral argument for Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., \u201c[T]he Clean Water Act is unique in both being quite vague in its reach, arguably unconstitutionally vague, and certainly harsh in the civil and criminal sanctions it puts into practice.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the Clean Water Act, Congress made it clear that it\u2019s \u201cthe policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution \u2026 .\u201d\n\nThe Obama rule ignored this state role. When the federal government tries to regulate every water imaginable, it doesn\u2019t leave much room for states and local governments to address water issues.\n\nCritics will argue that getting rid of this vast federal role in regulating waters will undermine water protection. Congress rejected that argument when it passed the Clean Water Act.\n\nLegislators recognized that states should play the lead role in addressing water pollution. That makes sense, because states are in the best position to address most water issues, and that\u2019s because they are closest to the issues and can develop policy that\u2019s tailored to address specific problems.\n\nThe Clean Water Act regulations are also just one piece in a massive web of laws and programs that helps to protect surface waters. (In addition to other federal programs and laws, there is, of course, state and local governments.)\n\nIt should also be noted that a separate federal law, the Safe Drinking Water Act, protects the water we drink.\n\nBy getting rid of the Obama rule, the Trump administration appears to recognize the rule\u2019s numerous problems. Now, it will be up to the Trump administration to develop a definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that does something unique; namely, one that follows the law.\n\nOn Feb. 14, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proposed their new definition, which is a major improvement from the Obama rule.\n\nThere are still improvements that are needed before any new definition is finalized. Justice Antonin Scalia in his plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States wrestled with many of the challenges that admittedly the agencies face when developing a workable definition of \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d\n\nIf the final rule is consistent with this thoughtful opinion, then the Trump administration will succeed where past administrations have failed in developing a workable, legally defensible definition of \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d\n\nUntil then, the Trump administration should be commended for getting rid of the Obama rule, which failed on all counts.", "description": "Thursday saw a major win for the rule of law, property rights, and the environment: The Trump administration announced that it had finalized its repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s infamous\u00a02015 Clean Water Rule.\n\nFor decades, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have struggled to define the Clean Water Act\u2019s term \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d in a manner that can pass judicial scrutiny.", "authors": ["Daren Bakst", "Senior Research Fellow In Agricultural Policy", "Bakst Studies", "Writes About Agricultural", "Environmental Policy", "Property Rights", "Among Other Issues."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-646354304.jpg?itok=Mgpd9Hah", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
