Shorter term, the damage to GM \u2014 losing an estimated $450 million a week \u2014 depends on how quickly the automaker can get its operations up and running once an agreement is reached. Workers say that on top of scaling back on spending, they're stressed about paying their bills.\n\nFrank Lee, a striking UAW auto worker from the General Motors assembly plant in Bowling Green, stands outside of his home in Auburn, Kentucky, U.S., October 1, 2019.

A typical GM worker earns about $30 an hour, or $1,200 per week, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nDolphin Green, a temporary worker at an engine and transmission plant in the Detroit suburb of Romulus, Michigan, took a job washing dishes at a restaurant to help make ends meet.\n\n\"I'm willing to sacrifice as long as possible,\" he said.\n\nHe's only been with GM for four months, making just under $16 per hour, but has hopes of going full-time so he can support a family.\n\nTemporary workers\n\nUse of temporary workers has been a major issue in the contract negotiations, along with outsourcing work to other countries, a point that surfaced on Tuesday.\n\nGreen has cut spending and has a girlfriend with a good job. But he's worried about a child support payment coming up at the end of the month and has talked to his case worker about temporarily reducing the payments.\n\nDennis Earl, president of UAW Local 14 in Toledo, said the union is doing what it can to help workers by advising them how to deal with bills that are piling up.\n\nThe union hall's kitchen is serving meals around the clock and donations of food and household items are pouring in from other labor groups in the area. \"Nobody's going to go hungry,\" he said.\n\n\"As this goes on and becomes more difficult, there's going to be some agitation, but for the most part these people are in it for the long haul,\" he said.\n\nLosing $82 million a day\n\nA Wall Street analyst estimates that GM has lost over $1.6 billion since the work stoppage began, and is now losing about $82 million per day. At some point, the losses will exceed what GM would save in holding out for more favorable terms from the union.\n\nGM dealers across the country report still-healthy inventory on their lots, but they're running short of parts to fix their customers' vehicles, and some have had to cancel service appointments.\n\nThe strike immediately shut down about 30 GM factories across the U.S., essentially ending the company's production. Factories in Canada and Mexico remained open for a while, but one assembly plant in Canada and another in Mexico have been forced to shut down due to parts shortages. Analysts expect the closures to spread to the few remaining plants that are open.\n\nEmergency cash\n\nMany workers stocked away emergency cash after being warned for months by union leaders about the possibility of a strike, but they said GM's temporary workers who make much less couldn't do that.\n\n\"We all knew this was coming for a long time, I'm set up. A lot of guys aren't in that same spot,\" said Tim Leiby, an eight-year employee in Toledo. \"I've got all my bills paid, but I know some people who don't.\"\n\nStill, he's cutting back on eating out, going to the movies and spending money on hobbies because \"we don't know how long this will last.\"\n\nHe also said he has a cousin who won't talk to him now because the strike has shut down the welding shop where she works.\n\n\"It's affecting everybody, it's affecting families. Even families that don't work here,\" he said.\n\nRipple effect\n\nThe Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in East Lansing, Michigan, estimates that 75,000 workers at auto parts supply companies have been laid off or had their wages reduced because of the strike.\n\nThat doesn't include waitresses, convenience store clerks and others who are seeing their hours cut because striking workers aren't out spending money.\n\nTruck driver Glen Hodge, who hauls scrap metal from a stamping plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, has been off the job the past three weeks.\n\nSince then, he's filed for unemployment, dropped his cable TV package, stopped going out to eat with his wife and even cut back on dog treats. It upsets him a bit when he sees gift cards and donations pouring in for the striking workers.\n\n\"What about the rest of us?\" he said on Wednesday. \"There's a bunch of us sitting around getting nothing.\"", "description": "Almost four weeks into the United Auto Workers' strike, employees are scaling back amid lost pay and overtime", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/c5650b9d-84dd-4147-b671-19c6ee5a6135/thumbnail/1200x630/7d51885461b3eb37817973fd0d0ad83f/rtx75ykq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
