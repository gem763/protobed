By speaking openly, Thomas said he hopes to educate and empower others in the same position.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, Stephen Fry, Kelly Holmes and Prince William were among those to tweet messages of support, with the latter writing: \u201cCourageous as ever \u2013 legend on the pitch and legend off it. You have our support Gareth. W.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:21 'I've got HIV and it's OK': Gareth Thomas aims to tackle stigma \u2013 video\n\nThomas, who on Sunday completed a 140.6-mile Ironman triathlon, has gone public after blackmailers threatened to reveal his secret and tabloid journalists went to the house of his parents.\n\nHe told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cI\u2019ve been living with this secret for years. I\u2019ve felt shame and keeping such a big secret has taken its toll.\n\n\u201cI was in a dark place, feeling suicidal. I thought about driving off a cliff. To me, wanting to die was just a natural thought and felt like the easier way out, but you have to confront things.\u201d\n\nThomas, 45, said he \u201cbroke down\u201d when he got the news of his diagnosis. \u201cWhen [the doctor] said those words ... I immediately thought I was going to die. I felt like an express train was hitting me at 300mph. Then I was thinking \u2018how long have I got left?\u201d\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gareth Thomas runs to score a try against the All Blacks during the second test in Wellington in 2005. Photograph: David Gray/Reuters\n\nIan Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said medical advances meant that someone effectively treated for HIV can have a normal life expectancy and cannot pass the virus on to their partner.\n\n\u201cThat has all changed but what hasn\u2019t changed is the stigma,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cFor Gareth to talk openly about living with HIV is going to have a massive impact in tackling the stigma that still exists, but also to normalise HIV as just a standard long-term medical condition that people can live a normal life with.\u201d\n\nGreen, who has lived with HIV himself for 23 years, said the stigma existed in many different ways and settings. \u201cThere are still people who face stigma in healthcare when they go and see their doctor or dentist.\n\n\u201cPeople face it in relationships. We did a survey which found 50% of people would not want to date somebody who is living with HIV even though there is no risk of transmission. Gareth\u2019s disclosure, his decision to tell his story, is huge.\u201d\n\nThomas made the revelation ahead of competing in one of the world\u2019s toughest Ironman challenges, one that involves swimming 2.4 miles in Carmarthen Bay, cycling 112 miles through Pembrokeshire national park and running a full marathon in and around the seaside town of Tenby. He finished the event in 12 hours, 18 minutes and 29 seconds, coming 413th out of 2,039 participants.\n\nGreen was there on Sunday to cheer Thomas on. \u201cHe started at 7am. He told me that he hopes to finish in daylight, which will be about 7pm this evening. Before he started this he couldn\u2019t swim \u2026 he is an extraordinary man.\u201d\n\nThomas, nicknamed Alfie, came out as gay in 2009 and remains one of the few professional team sportspeople to have done so.\n\nHe approached the Trust six months ago asking it to take part in a BBC Wales documentary which is due to be screened on Wednesday.\n\nRugby star Gareth Thomas: \u2018I want a black-and-white law so people can deal with homophobia\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cWe have become really good friends,\u201d said Green. \u201cI hope I\u2019ve been there to support him in what has been quite an emotional time for him, but one that he has coped with remarkably well.\n\n\u201cGareth really is passionate about making a difference \u2026 he sees it as a long-term commitment to eradicating HIV stigma, it is an absolute passion. We are very lucky to have someone like Gareth advocating for people living with HIV.\u201d\n\nThomas explains his motivation in a short, powerful clip from the documentary. Trying to hold back tears, his voice breaking, Thomas said: \u201cThe reason I\u2019m doing this is because firstly I want to remember what it\u2019s like to live again.\n\n\u201cI want to remember what it\u2019s like to feel free. And by doing that \u2026 I want to empower so many other people who are in exactly the same position as me, and probably ten times worse, to be able to feel free as well.\n\n\u201cAnd to do that I have to educate myself. I have to be strong. I have to be at the end of it a completely different person to the person I am now.\n\n\u201cI think what I want to learn more than anything \u2026 is that, I\u2019ve got HIV and it\u2019s OK, like. That\u2019s what I want to learn more than anything.\u201d\n\nThe documentary will tell how blackmailers forced him to go public. At one point he had to consult lawyers after a tabloid newspaper found out about his HIV status and journalists went to his parents\u2019 home.\n\nThomas posted a confessional video on Twitter in which he talks about it being his secret to reveal, \u201cnot the evils that made my life hell, threatening to tell you before I do.\n\n\u201cEven though I have been forced to tell you this, I choose to fight, to educate and break the stigma around this subject.\u201d\n\nThomas, who will be a pundit for ITV in the upcoming rugby world cup, also reveals that he married his husband Stephen three years ago.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
