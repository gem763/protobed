I arrive to find that my seat is taken by someone's (ahem, unconfirmed) guest. No big deal, though. I sit across the runway in the front row and watch the most stellar and wearable collection go by. I love these pieces!'\n\nMemories: At the time, Meghan also name checked meeting Rachel on both her Instagram account (since deleted) and in an article for Glamour.com\n\nShe continued, 'With my buddy Joe Zee, I meet Rachel Zoe and her lovely son. This woman is on another level of good. She's so real, refreshing, and talented. Check out this picture. There's no one I would rather be photo bombed by than Skylar [Rachel's son]!'\n\nEven on her now-deleted Instagram post with Rachel - the Los Angeles-native disabled her social media accounts shortly before marrying Prince Harry - she added the hashtag 'grateful'.\n\nIn a veritable time capsule, the Glamour.com 'diary' entry from Meghan, then 32-years-old and breaking into the industry thanks to her role in Suits, describes her excitement at attending illustrious events like the Vanity Fair's International Best-Dressed List party and the Novac Djokovic Foundation dinner.\n\nDuring her jam-packed Fashion Week schedule, she also took time out to take part in the Cantor Fitzgerald Charity Day for Many Hopes on 9/11.\n\n'I am on the trading room floor along with Billy Crystal, Julianne Moore, and other celebs,' she wrote. 'Here I am making calls and deals, where a percentage of the proceeds go to Many Hopes... an organization that educates and empowers young girls in Kenya who are impoverished, orphaned and affected by abuse.'\n\nRubbing shoulders: At her first NYFW, Meghan sat front row at Marchesa, joining designer Georgina Chapman (left), while she met Rozzi Crane at the Tracey Reese show (right)\n\nUp and comer: Meghan also went to the Herve Leger By Max Azria show in September 2013, where she was joined by Cara Santana, left, and Petra Nemcova, right\n\nWhen Rachel shared the throwback photo over the weekend, many users chimed in in the comments, calling her out for deciding to share the picture which was taken after her eponymous label's show.\n\nFashion force: Meghan wrote about meeting Rachel, pictured, back in 2013 and called her 'real, refreshing and talented'\n\nSome cruelly suggested that Rachel was trying to 'cash in' on Meghan's status now that she is a member of the British royal family.\n\n'You probably weren\u2019t interested in her at the time!! I\u2019m sure you are now though,' said a commentor\n\n'And you\u2019re posting this now because....? Was it posted then,' questioned another.\n\n'Orrrrrrrr she was a nobody actress and you couldn't give a rip! But now that she's royalty, you'll claim it,' accused another.\n\n'Yet you post it now. damn clout chasing,' one person slammed.\n\nOne skeptical user added, 'Bet If she wasn\u2019t married to Harry you would never post this...'\n\nSome even want as far as to speculate that 'Meghan's PR team' were purposefully trying to align her with celebrities such as Rachel by encouraging the throwback.\n\nHowever, there were some positive comments among the vitriol.\n\n'Such a great picture of both you you. Thank you for sharing,' commended one user.\n\n'Two great & beautiful ladies. Rachel [you're] the royal of fashion,' said another.", "description": "Rachel Zoe was trolled when she shared a throwback snap with then-actress Meghan Markle.
