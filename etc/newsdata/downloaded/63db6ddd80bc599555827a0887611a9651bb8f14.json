And no money has actually been moved at this point to begin with.\"\n\nLast week it was revealed that the Trump administration had notified Congress that it planned to reprogram funds from several Homeland Security agencies \u2014 including FEMA, the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Coast Guard \u2014 to expand space in detention centers for migrants and finance other immigration enforcement initiatives.\n\nThe administration is slated to use $155 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to establish facilities along the border for asylum seekers placed in the controversial Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program, known as \"Remain in Mexico.\"\n\nThe move elicited withering condemnation from congressional Democrats, who denounced it as a politically motivated decision that could hamper the government's ability to respond to disasters \u2014 especially during hurricane season.\n\nBut McAleenan on Sunday pushed back against the criticism, saying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the vocal critics of the decision, was \"misinformed.\"\n\nAsked about concerns that the Department of Homeland Security's focus on immigration enforcement during Mr. Trumps tenure could make the agency ill-equipped to handle its important national security and disaster response responsibilities, McAleenan said he and other department officials were not \"distracted.\"\n\n\"We have to manage two crises at the same time,\" he said.\n\nPressed again, the Homeland Security chief reiterated that the response to Dorian \u2014 which he said might not make landfall in the U.S. \u2014 would suffer no operational or preparedness impact due to the transfer of funds to the border.\n\n\"None whatsoever \u2014 I can say that unequivocally,\" McAleenan said.", "description": "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan defended the controversial decision to divert millions in disaster relief funds to the southern border as his agency prepares to respond to Hurricane Dorian", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/01/9b77f709-38ec-42de-b663-0436b22282c1/thumbnail/1200x630/d2f4b6fb0a2060db68aa1a998475826d/1567344564896.png"}
