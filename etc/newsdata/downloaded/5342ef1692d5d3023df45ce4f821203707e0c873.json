I don't know why people can't just scroll on.\n\n\"The hate messages started rolling in, I got a minimum of 200 angry and hateful messages.\"\n\n(Image: CARLEE THOMAS PHOTOGRAPHY / CATERS NEWS)\n\nThe zombie-themed shoot shows little Coraline sitting in a bucket full of \"blood\" made from red jelly and melted chocolate, while holding a fake plastic brain - and October also has some of the \"blood\" smeared on her face while striking a scary pose.\n\nAlthough some feedback online has been positive, Carlee was disgusted with the abuse.\n\nShe's hit back at the strangers, arguing her kids enjoyed the treat.\n\nCarlee, who herself is a photographer, continued: \"I knew that posting them online was a bit risky, as it's not everyone's cup of tea but I never thought people would be that angry about them.\n\n\"We do horror shoots throughout the year, but I don't normally post them.\n\n(Image: CARLEE THOMAS PHOTOGRAPHY / CATERS NEWS)\n\n(Image: CARLEE THOMAS PHOTOGRAPHY / CATERS NEWS)\n\n\"The actual blood part, is strawberry jello, water and chocolate syrup. It tastes like chocolate covered cherries, so both the girls love it.\n\n\"The blood on their faces is a mix of strawberry syrup, chocolate syrup and some thickening agents so that it looks more realistic. The brain is plastic, and I painted it to make it look more real.\n\n\"Most of the horror effect is from editing. If you saw the photos straight from the camera, Coraline just looks like a happy baby in a tub.\"\n\nThe mother, of Decatur, Alabama, US, also said her husband Benjamin, 28, is really proud of what she does and loves seeing his girls having fun and dressing up for Halloween.\n\nShe added: \"I got loads of positive feedback. For every mean message I've got, there are about 15 others from lovely people who tell me how much they love it and how creative it is.\n\n(Image: CARLEE THOMAS PHOTOGRAPHY / CATERS NEWS)\n\n\"I'm not going to take the photos down. I don't let their negativity bother me, and I wish those people all the best.\n\n\"They might need to find a hobby or something instead of taking time out of their day to send hateful messages on the internet.\n\n\"It was all a bit of fun and no one was harmed. I do it because it makes me happy and my girls enjoy it.\n\n\"I'm not going to stop. I'm never going to be able to please everyone. I'm sorry if some people don't like it, but we do. And that's the important thing really.\n\n\"October loves everything horror, and she wants to be a 'scream queen' scary movie actress. Her photos were all her idea and she really loved how they turned out.\"", "description": "Carlee Thomas, from Decatur, Alabama, US, shared the pictures of her \"Zombie Kids\" on Facebook in time for Halloween", "authors": ["Jasmine Kazlauskas", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Carlee Thomas Photography", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671244.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-HALLOWEEN-TOT-PHOTO-SHOOT-MUM-SLAMMED.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
