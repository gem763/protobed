In the past year, the fire service or mountain rescue team have been called out 144 times to save stranded tourists.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that people aren\u2019t used to the dirt roads in the area and so rely on Google Maps,\u201d Corrias told the Guardian. \u201cBut after a while they realise that they are not on a proper road, and so we have to go and rescue them. We have had so many instances, especially in recent years \u2013 unfortunately Google Maps does not take people to the places they want to go.\u201d\n\nRoad signs have now been put up by the local police with the message: \u201cDo not follow the directions suggested by Google Maps\u201d. Corrias will also intensify an information campaign on social media while providing people with paper maps.\n\n\u201cThis has become a real problem. It\u2019s not possible for us to ban its use so this is a warning: do not use Google Maps as you\u2019ll end up in an obscure place. It just requires a little common sense.\u201d\n\nThe local authority said it had informed Google that its directions were leading people to \u201cimprobable\u201d roads.\n\nCorrias advised visitors to check directions before setting off for a drive or hike in the area.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of an issue in Sardinia where Google Maps is routing some drivers down roads that can be difficult to navigate due to their terrain. We are currently investigating ways that we can better alert drivers about these types of roads.\u201d", "description": "Rescuers in Baunei called out 144 times in past year to save visitors from impassable roads", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b009ec331582636a9dbc18ea025d0b66f831a88/0_166_5130_3079/master/5130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=627046060070f56989dcca4939be2ac1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
