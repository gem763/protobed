Ashleigh Barty of Australia in action against Kiki Bertens of Netherlands. REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\n(Reuters) - World number one Ash Barty beat eighth seed Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands 6-3 3-6 7-6(7) in Beijing to seal her spot in the final of the China Open on Saturday.\n\nBoth players saved a match point in a thrilling third set tiebreak before Barty, the Australian top seed, wrapped up the encounter in two hours 20 minutes.\n\nIt was Barty\u2019s 19th win in a three-setter this year and her third in a row after beating Zheng Saisai in the last 16 and seventh seed Petra Kvitova in the quarter-finals, with both matches lasting more than two hours.\n\n\u201cI enjoy those moments. I enjoy when it\u2019s tight, when your back\u2019s against the wall,\u201d Barty said after her fifth career win over Bertens. \u201cThat really brings out the fun for me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been really nice to be able to play (these) two matches the last two days, incredible level. Regardless if I was on a plane home today, I probably wouldn\u2019t have stressed any more or less about it.\u201d\n\nIn a see-saw match, both players dropped serve three times with little to separate the two until the tiebreak in the decider.\n\nBertens first saved a match point with a long rally to tie the score at 6-6 in the tiebreak before Barty fought back to 7-7. She then forced the Dutchwoman into an error and won the match on her next match point to advance.\n\n\u201cI think it was a great match, great fight from both sides,\u201d Bertens said. \u201cIt could go either way. It was not me today. I played the right way, I was coming forward, I played aggressive where I could.\u201d\n\nBarty will now play either Naomi Osaka or defending champion Caroline Wozniacki, who were meeting in the second semi-final later on Saturday.", "description": "World number one Ash Barty beat eighth seed Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands 6-3 3-6 7-6(7) in Beijing to seal her spot in the final of the China Open on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437360847&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9409Y-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
