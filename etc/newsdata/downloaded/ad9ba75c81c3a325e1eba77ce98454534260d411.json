It was inappropriate and we apologise for this mistake.\"\n\nWhat is Area 51?\n\nIt was created during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union as a testing and development facility for aircraft.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding the site has helped fuel many conspiracy theories.\n\nMost infamous is the claim that the site hosts an alien spacecraft and the bodies of its pilots after they crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government says there were no aliens and the crashed craft was a weather balloon.\n\nThe US government did not officially confirm the base existed until 2013.", "description": "The tweet threatened to deploy a B-2 bomber against \"millennials\" planning to raid the base.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A2E4/production/_108900714_mediaitem108900713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
