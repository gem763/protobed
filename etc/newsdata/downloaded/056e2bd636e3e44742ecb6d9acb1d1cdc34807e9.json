Beyond that I\u2019m waiting to be told. They went too hard in heavy ground (in the Arc) and, let\u2019s face it, the whole lot of them walked home.\n\n\u2018They all went too soon in the straight and overdid it. Every horse in that race had a very tiring experience. I wouldn\u2019t dream of bringing her back 13 days after that.\u2019\n\nGosden\u2019s Stradivarius was set to chase a second win in Saturday\u2019s Long Distance Cup but heavy ground could throw that into doubt.\n\nGosden added: \u2018If it went bottomless or heavy, there would have to be a concern whether he\u2019d run.\u2019", "description": "Conquered heroine Enable will not run on Qipco British Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday but beyond that her future has still to be decided, according to trainer John Gosden.", "authors": ["Marcus Townend For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/20/19632960-0-image-a-5_1570907632606.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
