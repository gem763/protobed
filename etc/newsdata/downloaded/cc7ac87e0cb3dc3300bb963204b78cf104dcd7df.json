I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question I asked you,\" Mason replied as Niinist\u00f6 could be seen chuckling over the exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve answered everything. It\u2019s a whole hoax. And you know who\u2019s playing into it? People like you,\u201d Trump rejoined, calling the media \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cfake.\u201d\n\nEventually, Mason dropped the issue and asked a question to the Finnish leader, inquiring about his response to a new World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that allows the U.S. to impose tariffs on European goods.\n\n\"That was a big win for the United States, right?\" Trump said before the Finnish leader could reply. \"You never had wins with other presidents, did you? But we\u2019re having a lot of wins at the WTO.\"\n\n\"This was a case that started, I think, 10 or 15 years ago,\" Mason said.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, your wins are now,\u201d Trump interjected, saying the WTO wants to keep him happy.\n\nDetails of Trump's call with Zelensky emerged last week. On the call, he asks Zelensky to \"look into\" Biden and get in touch with his personal lawyer and the attorney general. The call has been a foundation for Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump capped the press conference by decrying the media as \"corrupt\" and accusing them of holding the country back.\n\n\"The United States is a great democracy,\" Trump said. \"And I\u2019m airing what I\u2019m airing because we are in fact a democracy. And if the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation.\"\n\n\"We are, Mr. President,\u201d CNN correspondent Jim Acosta James (Jim) AcostaFox rejects Biden request to not run Trump campaign ad CNN refuses to run Biden-Ukraine ad by Trump campaign Trump fumes amid impeachment furor MORE, a frequent antagonist of the president's, chimed in.\n\n\"We would be far greater when we don\u2019t have the CNNs of the world who are corrupt people,\" Trump concluded before walking off the stage.\n\nThe president routinely decries the coverage he dislikes as \"fake news\" and has labeled certain outlets the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nHowever, Trump has grown increasingly hostile in recent days as the impeachment inquiry that threatens his presidency ramps up, accusing a congressman of \"treason\" and sharing a quote that suggested a civil war could break out if he were removed from office.\n\nTrump earlier Wednesday lashed the media over reporting that he wanted a moat constructed near the U.S.-Mexico border. Throughout the exchange, he blasted The Washington Post over its reporting, even though the details came from a forthcoming book from two New York Times reporters.\n\nTrump did offer rare praise for the Times during Wednesday\u2019s news conference, particularly in response to a story saying that Schiff had early knowledge of the outlines of a whistleblower complaint about the Zelensky call.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, The New York Times, I can\u2019t believe they wrote it. Maybe they\u2019re getting better,\u201d he told Fox News reporter John Roberts. Trump claimed without evidence the report showed that Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint and called it a \u201cscandal.\u201d\n\nMark Zaid, one of the attorneys who represents the whistleblower, subsequently told The Hill that Schiff did not help the whistleblower write the complaint.", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday\u00a0grew testy with a reporter who\u00a0pressed\u00a0him about what he was seeking from Ukraine in relation to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, demanding that the reporter ask a question to Finnish Preside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_10022019wh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
