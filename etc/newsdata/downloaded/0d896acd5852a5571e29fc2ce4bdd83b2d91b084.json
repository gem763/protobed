I think the question is do you need congressional action or can the executive act,\u201d said Mr. Cuccinelli, a former attorney general in Virginia who\u2019s seen as a front-runner to be named the next acting secretary at Homeland Security.\n\nHe spoke to reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nBirthright citizenship is the policy of granting automatic U.S. citizenship to almost anyone born on American soil, including children of illegal immigrants. The only major exception is children born to foreign diplomats.\n\nMany legal scholars say the 14th Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship, though some scholars say the exception for those not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the U.S. \u2014 the reason why diplomats\u2019 children aren\u2019t covered \u2014 would also create an opening to refuse automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly raised the issue, including most recently in August when he said it\u2019s still very much a goal of his.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at that very seriously,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House.\n\nBut Mr. Cuccinelli signaled the matter has not been prominent in his work during his four months as acting chief at USCIS.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s interest in the issue rankles immigrant-rights activists, who say it\u2019s unconstitutional, impractical and sends a poor message to migrants about America\u2019s commitment to being a nation of immigrants.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
