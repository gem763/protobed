The story -- titled \u201cAnxious Democratic Establishment Asks, \u2018Is There Anybody Else?\u2019\u201d -- said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against President Trump, citing Biden\u2019s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.\n\nHOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS 'POLITICAL REVENGE,' 'SHOULD BE DISMISSED QUICKLY' IN SENATE, LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS\n\n\"What does she have to lose at this point? She's run twice, she's lost twice, in one she won the popular vote. Her image is what her image is. In the words of a famous woman, what difference at this point would it make?\" he asked, referring to the former secretary of state's famous remark at a 2015 House hearing on the Benghazi attack.\n\nBEN SHAPIRO: NOW IS THE TIME FOR HILLARY TO JUMP BACK IN\n\nShapiro pointed to Clinton becoming more vocal in recent weeks during a series of media appearances to promote a new book. He noted that Clinton went after 2020 candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, in the \"weirdest way,\" claiming the Iraq War veteran is a Russian asset.\n\nShapiro said the attack was \"exactly what [Gabbard] has been waiting for\" as she responded by calling Clinton \"the queen of warmongers\" and accusing her of being behind a campaign to sink her candidacy.\n\nOverall, Shapiro said the Democratic presidential field, currently led by Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, is weak and Clinton sees an opportunity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Elizabeth Warren is weak,\" he said, noting that Warren's newly released education plan would ban federal funding for charter schools, claiming they're not competitive.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" he asked, adding that \"if you're Hillary, you gotta be thinking 'maybe I ought to jump back in.'\"", "description": "Ben Shapiro asked Wednesday what Hillary Clinton has to lose by jumping into the race in the \"incredibly weak\" Democratic presidential field.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Shapiro-Clinton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
