We saw against the United States that if we are not at our best for 80 minutes we could pay a heavy price.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Best win of my career\u2019 \u2013\n\nOnly four players \u2014 centre Sofiane Guitoune, hooker Camille Chat, lock Paul Gabrillagues and wing Alivereti Raka \u2014 remain from the side struggled for most of their match against the USA.\n\nThey were only ahead 12-9 with 15 minutes to play before a late rally blew the score out to 33-9.\n\nAgainst Argentina they led 20-3 before falling behind and needed a late drop goal to win 23-21.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re unbeaten but we haven\u2019t exactly set the world alight,\u201d said coach Jacques Brunel.\n\n\u201cTonga play with a lot of force, they are very aggressive and enterprising. It\u2019s a big challenge.\u201d\n\nThree members of the current French squad and two Tongans played in the classic battle eight years ago.\n\nMaxime Medard, who starts at fullback on Sunday, as well as Guirado and Picamoles played for France, with Ntamack\u2019s father Emile the assistant coach. Flanker Sione Kalamafoni and centre Siale Piutau turned out for Tonga.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the best win of my career,\u201d said Piutau, now Tonga\u2019s captain, adding it also helped to have six members of his match-day 23 based in France.\n\n\u201cThey understand the mindset and psyche of French players. when we beat them in 2011 we had a lot of players who played alongside the French boys and it\u2019s definiteley a benefit for us.\u201d\n\nFrance and Tonga both lost two pool matches in 2011, but France progressed because of superior bonus points and they went all the way to the final, where they were beaten 8-7 by New Zealand.", "description": "Kumamoto (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 France go into Sunday\u2019s clash with Tonga looking to erase an eight-year nightmare and produce a dominant performance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/9bcf96_halani-aulika-was-one-celebrating-tongan-players-2011-win-france-spectre-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
