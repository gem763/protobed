Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) used to sound like on impeachment, back when he was explaining why President Bill Clinton\u2019s failure to cooperate with an impeachment inquiry was itself impeachable:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLindsey Graham: A president who doesn't comply with Congressional requests for information is subject to impeachment. pic.twitter.com/Dhw5VBxbf0 \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 8, 2019\n\nRRL certainly is in tune with the broader electorate, which has moved decisively in favor of impeachment. (I might suggest the group next target Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who cannot muster the courage to say enlisting a foreign government to interfere with our elections is wrong.)\n\nThe Morning Consult/Politico poll finds that \u201c50 percent of registered voters surveyed would support the Senate\u2019s removing Trump from office, while 43 percent oppose the president\u2019s removal.\u201d\n\nIn the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll reports that \"47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine\u2019s president to look into the Bidens are either \u2018quite serious\u2019 or \u2018extremely serious.\u2019 That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans.\u201d In the same survey, a clear majority, 53 percent, think he has not been honesty and trustworthy about Ukraine; only 38 percent believe he has been.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven more worrisome to Trump, his favorite news outlet, Fox News, released its poll on Wednesday, finding: \u201cA new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don\u2019t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.\u201d\n\nFrom all of this, one can draw a few conclusions. We should, of course, keep in mind that events are moving quickly, but uniformly in a direction unfavorable to the president.\n\nFirst, the name-calling and misinformation coming from the White House and dutifully parroted by sycophantic right-wing outlets and individual commentators is wholly ineffective. The only people they convince are those Republicans who can be convinced of anything. Remarkably, a small but perceptible share of Republicans have had enough of Trump\u2019s act and see real impeachable conduct at issue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSecond, Trump\u2019s defiance of Congress\u2019s power to investigate impeachable conduct seems to have convinced no one and has rattled his Republican allies in Congress. The Post reports, \u201cThe broad legal effort escalated on Tuesday when the White House counsel sent a letter to House Democratic leaders dismissing Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry as \u2018illegitimate\u2019 and stating that the entire executive branch would refuse to cooperate with it.\u201d Legal experts sneered at the letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone. (\u201cSeveral legal scholars panned Cipollone\u2019s letter as a political document with little legal relevance. . . . Ilya Somin, a professor at Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, joked in a Facebook post that the Trump administration\u2019s legal reasoning made him wonder \u2018whether the White House counsel was sick the day they taught law at law school.\u2019\u201d)\n\nAt the same time, Trump\u2019s outrageous claims in court of absolute immunity, including the claim that Watergate-era precedent was wrongly decided, threatens to elicit a strong rebuke from the courts.\n\nFinally, the president\u2019s move to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, triggering the expected onslaught from Turkish forces, as well as his ignorant and cavalier response (\u201cnoting that \u2018they didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us in Normandy\u2019 and were only interested in fighting for \u2018their land\u2019\u201d), has generated a rare moment of dissension in GOP ranks. The reaction underscores the question for Republicans: Why exactly are they defending such a manifestly unfit president whose policies enrage them? The answer is political cowardice. Voters will have a chance to render a verdict on their fitness for office as well.\n\nWatch:\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Graham should listen to Graham.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CCngb1EheX4XpAOzriQUwMVCHSs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XUTF73HKUQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
