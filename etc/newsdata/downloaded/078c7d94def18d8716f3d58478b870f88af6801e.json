Since returning to work I\u2019ve managed large projects and am delaying trying for baby number two as I don\u2019t want to leave during project delivery. I have high aspirations and I really like my job and enjoy these opportunities. My boss is offering me another big project next year and I feel in a predicament. If I have my \u201cfamily life\u201d hat on, I don\u2019t want to leave trying for another baby any longer, but if all goes well, I would be pregnant for a large portion of it and my boss wouldn\u2019t give ownership to me \u2013 he\u2019d find someone else on the team. My husband thinks we should just go for it. However, it doesn\u2019t have a massive effect on his working life and career. I\u2019d be grateful if there were any reality checks as I feel I\u2019m going around in circles.\n\nMariella replies Let\u2019s not leap too far ahead. First, can I just say how livid your letter makes me. There\u2019s too much lip service paid to advances in equality for women, generally from those with something to gain by association (ie politicians or business moguls). But whether it\u2019s sexual abuse or harassment, equal pay, investment in female-specific medical research or a fairer division of domestic labour, we still haven\u2019t caught up with the rhetoric. Instead, we dawdle in the doldrums and it\u2019s hard not to surmise that no matter how loud we shout and how many headlines we monopolise with salacious stories of starlets abused, enduring equality remains far from accomplished.\n\nI know that right now we don\u2019t have time to be worrying about trivialities like equal rights what with a recession looming and small islanders running amok in the corridors of power, but the simple fact is that if you empower your female population your GDP grows, if you don\u2019t it withers. The evidence is that no country can afford to make working life an unrewarding prospect for half of the population. Yet it\u2019s a culture that continues to flourish, seven decades after promises of pay parity became enshrined in UK law. Other nations, once examples of bad practice, from South America to South Africa and across Asia, are fast putting our stalled levels of emancipation to shame.\n\nYou have every right to this work and no duty to inform your boss\n\nThe outrage that followed revelations that the rot at the heart of the male establishment was still flourishing \u2013 from Harvey Weinstein to Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 failed to illuminate the less spotlighted realms of female experience \u2013 zero-hour contracts, enduring domestic abuse, women unable to afford to go back to work or in jail because they can\u2019t feed their children without shoplifting.\n\nNot for the first time in my life I note that the story has moved on and brave survivors and their flame-carrying contemporaries are back in the crepuscular corner that\u2019s been a regular detention location for my pioneering feminist generation. In maturity, you realise there really is nothing new on this earth, just the same old injustices, edging inexorably and hopefully forward to a brighter day. To find women in your situation in the 21st century, still trying to find ways around the inevitability that pregnancy equals demotion is, as I said earlier, entirely enraging.\n\nI can\u2019t give advice about your particular workplace. What I can offer is encouragement not to accept the fate you describe and to stand your ground. Bosses will adhere to employment law if they know they\u2019ll be held to account. I suggest you acquaint yourself intimately with your rights, then make the choices you feel best for your family. Rights are hard fought for. They are there to protect us and if we allow them to be ignored the world simply won\u2019t change.\n\nI don\u2019t know what sex your first child is, but once you have a daughter it\u2019s hard to take anything on the chin that spells unfairness for her future. You have every right to run this new project, no responsibility to inform your boss that you are thinking of having another baby and every reason to forge ahead with energy and enthusiasm on both fronts.\n\nI went back to work after three months following the birth of both my children, because I\u2019m a freelance and that was as long as I could afford to stay away. If you share your leave between maternity and paternity, then your husband, too, will discover the challenges of balancing parenthood and professional life. A BBC boss told my agent 15 years ago when my daughter was born that my \u201cbreastfeeding schedule was inconvenient\u201d and stopped using me. I was advised to accept that fate. In today\u2019s more adversarial climate I\u2019d be too ashamed not to call him out. Progress may be painfully slow, but when we refuse to settle for less than we are due, the future bodes better for our daughters.\n\nFinally, while most of us will regret elements of how we raise our children, I\u2019ve yet to meet anyone who regretted having one. I suggest you stop worrying so much \u2013 the wind is in your favour, you just need to spread your wings.\n\nIf you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.
