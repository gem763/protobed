Wyn has scrummaged well in training and it\u2019s one of his strengths.\n\n\u201cWith Aaron, he\u2019s just a player that\u2019s continued to improve. He\u2019s incredibly athletic and an intelligent rugby player. Since his first cap 12 months ago, he\u2019s just gone from strength to strength.\u201dThe halfback pairing sees Gareth Davies play alongside flyhalf Dan Biggar, while Hadleigh Parkes and Jonathan Davies make up the centre-pairing.\n\nLiam Williams is at fullback along with wings Josh Adams and George North.\n\nGatland also confirmed that loack Adam Beard had arrived in Japan on Saturday after an appendix surgery and started training, but is not expected to feature in the Sept. 29 meeting with Australia that follows the Georgia clash.\n\nCory Hill, another of the injured locks, is also back in training and should be fit for the team\u2019s second pool match.\n\nWales\u2019 only previous meeting with Georgia resulted in a narrow 13-6 victory in Cardiff in the November internationals in 2017, though Williams is the only member of Monday\u2019s run-on team who started that game.\n\nWales will be delighted for the matches to start after a turbulent build-up to the World Cup that saw backs coach Rob Howley return home following an alleged breach of betting rules.\n\nTeam:\n\n15-Liam Williams, 14-George North, 13-Jonathan Davies, 12-Hadleigh Parkes, 11-Josh Adams, 10-Dan Biggar, 9-Gareth Davies, 8-Josh Navidi, 7-Justin Tipuric, 6- Aaron Wainwright, 5-Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4-Jake Ball, 3-Tomas Francis, 2-Ken Owens, 1-Wyn Jones\n\nReplacements: 16-Elliot Dee, 17-Nicky Smith, 18-Dillon Lewis, 19-Aaron Shingler, 20-Josh Navidi, 21-Tomos Williams, 22-Rhys Patchell, 23-Leigh Halfpenny.", "description": "Wales coach Warren Gatland admits he is worried about the forward muscle of Georgia as he named a full-strength team for his side's Rugby World Cup Pool D opener at the City of Toyota Stadium on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432284491&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K07F-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
