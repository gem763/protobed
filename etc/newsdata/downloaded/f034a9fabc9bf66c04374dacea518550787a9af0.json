REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Tulsi Gabbard resigned from her post on Sunday to endorse Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, following months of rising tensions within the group.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s most important for us, as we look at our choices as to who our next commander in chief will be, is to recognize the necessity to have a commander in chief who has foresight, who exercises good judgment,\u201d Gabbard, a U.S. representative for Hawaii, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nGabbard, one of five vice chairs, and her committee colleagues have butted heads over a thin debate schedule in the months leading to Democratic voting contests for the party\u2019s nomination, with Gabbard calling for the group to add more debates to the calendar.\n\nSanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is competing with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination to run for president on Nov. 8. Critics have said the scheduling of the debates has favored Clinton, who is better known than Sanders and is favored to win the nominating contest.\n\nCommittee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement accepting Gabbard\u2019s resignation, calling her a friend and praising the active-duty veteran for her service in the armed forces.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Gabbard is a role model who embodies the American ideal that anyone can dream big and make a difference,\u201d Wasserman said in the statement.\n\n\u201cShe is also a colleague in Congress and a friend, and I look forward to continuing to work alongside her when our Party unites behind whoever emerges as our nominee.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Alana Wise; Editing by David Goodman and Jonathan Oatis)\n\nThis article was funded in part by SAP.
