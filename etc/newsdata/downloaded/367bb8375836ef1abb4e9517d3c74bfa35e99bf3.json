But while tracking apps and devices can be helpful motivators for many, they are not right for everyone. Taking a numbers-focused approach to health \u2014 defining it in terms of calories, steps and pounds \u2014 can detract from the inherent pleasures of eating well and being active. It can also be anxiety provoking and even dangerous for some: There is evidence, for example, that using a tracking device exacerbates symptoms of eating disorders. Instead of zeroing in on numbers, it may be better to self-monitor in a more intuitive way and with a wider-angle perspective, evaluating eating patterns and activities based on how they make you feel and whether they contribute to your long-term goals. Luckily, you can now enlist your smartphone to help you do that, too. These five e-tools are designed help you reach your wellness goals more mindfully.\n\nAte Food Diary is an app that, from my experience, lives up to the description on its website: \u201cIt\u2019s visual, mindful and nonjudgmental. Instead of calories, we focus on how meals make you feel.\u201d Type your wellness goal into the app (I wrote \u201ceat better\u201d and later, just to see what would happen, \u201close weight\u201d) and it prompts you to select specific steps you will take toward that goal from dozens of behavior-based options such as \u201ccook more often,\u201d \u201cno snacking after dinner\u201d or \u201ceat most of your food from plants.\u201d Refreshingly, even when I chose \u201close weight\u2019 as my goal, none of the actions referred to body weight or calories. To start a log, you take a photo of your food, choose whether what you ate was \u201con path\u201d or \u201coff path\u201d and answer multiple-choice questions such as why you ate, who you ate with, where you ate and how the food made you feel. At the day\u2019s end, you get a visual recap of your food images plus stats on the percentage of meals that were \u201con path,\u201d the frequency of your meals and the length of your overnight fast. There is an option to share your journal with friends for support and a system for making your feed available to your health professional or coach. The basic version of the app is free, but you can personalize the questions and get other benefits, the ability to log beverage intake and customize the way you track mood and feelings, by upgrading to premium, which costs $5.99 monthly.\n\nGood for: those who want the accountability and awareness that comes with keeping a food diary, without the calorie-counting or diet mentality.\n\nRecovery Record was designed as an eating disorder recovery app, but it can be an effective tool for anyone seeking a better relationship with food and body. Based on the principals of cognitive behavioral therapy, it enables you to monitor what you eat and the feelings associated with it, uncover unwanted behaviors, such as skipping meals or bingeing, and develop skills to cope with them \u2014 establishing regular meal patterns and tactics for overcoming unwanted urges, for example. You can use it on your own, but the app creators strongly encourage linking your account with your health-care provider, such as a dietitian or psychologist, for optimal care. As with Ate Food Diary, you set goals and snap pictures of your food to enter it into your log and then click to answer questions about how the meal made you feel, who you ate with, where you ate, etc.\n\nBut this app goes deeper, helping with issues around disordered eating, addressing ways to manage triggers and urges, improve body image and suggestions for self-care, such as breathing and visualization exercises. With each log entry, the app also asks whether you\u2019ve restricted yourself, binged or had the urge to do so. The app is free to individual users; the company charges clinicians and health organizations for using it with their patients.\n\nGood for: those recovering from an eating disorder or struggling with food and body image issues.\n\nAm I Hungry ? is an app developed by author and physician Michelle May and is designed to help you eat more mindfully and less emotionally. It takes you through a set of questions guiding you to respond to your internal hunger cues and examine other feelings, such as stress or boredom, that may be driving you to eat. The app is very rudimentary, with none of the sleek graphics and high-tech interactive elements of the others on this list, but the line of self-inquiry it establishes can be powerfully effective. In fact, it is similar to a system I used with my clients when I was in private practice, and that many dietitians continue to use.\n\nWhen you click the \u201cI want to eat\u201d button on the opening screen, you are guided through a decision tree of sorts to help you to determine why, when, what and how much you want to eat. Built-in tools, such as a 10- point hunger-fullness rating scale and lists of strategies to help if you are reaching for food without feeling physically hungry, help you along the way. With practice, this way of tapping into and heeding your internal cues becomes more second nature, and this app, which costs $2.99, can help get you there.\n\nGood for: those seeking to move away from emotional and impulsive eating toward more mindful, self-nurturing food choices.\n\nInsight Timer is another app that may help you on your quest to eat more mindfully and live better. It offers a library of thousands of guided meditations addressing an array of wellness concerns from sleeping better to dealing with anxiety. I entered \u201cmindful eating\u201d into the app\u2019s search function and was led to a vast array of free guided meditations, lasting from three to about 30 minutes, with that. I listened to several and liked some instructors very much, while others grated on me almost immediately. But there is such a wide variety of classes to choose from on this app, you are bound to find at some that suit you. You can upgrade to receive access to a wide selection of more in depth 10-session courses plus other features such as offline listening and advanced audio features. ($59.99 annually; there is a seven-day free trial for the premium upgrade). In the free app there are charts where you can track the meditations you have completed and the time you have spent meditating, and a social platform where you can connect with instructors and other users.\n\nGood for: those seeking to cultivate a more mindful approach to wellness overall.\n\nShapa is not just an app, it\u2019s a scale that is linked to one. But it is a scale with a different mind-set, which is apparent at first glance because it has no number display at all. When you step on this scale, the app reveals your Shapa color, a shade based on changes in your weight and body composition, taking into account normal weight fluctuations. (Shapa initially determines this after a 10-day calibration period.) A green color display means you are holding steady (within your normal range of fluctuations) compared to the last time you stepped on it, gray indicates you are gaining weight/fat and blue means you are losing weight/fat. Because Shapa\u2019s assessment is longer range and multi-factorial, it tracks more meaningful patterns than simply weighing yourself would, and as someone who finds regular scales incredibly anxiety provoking, it is a much kinder and gentler experience than facing down the harshness of an absolute and often randomly fluctuating number. The act of stepping on the Shapa felt to me like a positive daily reminder to stay focused on my wellness goals. Each time you step on it, the app displays your color and suggests a couple of wellness missions based on the goals and personality information you enter in the beginning. The missions that popped up on mine were well-crafted and relevant to me such as \u201cLook at your calendar for the next 7 days, Plan in and schedule out your exercise sessions for the week.\u201d The app is easy to use, and there are friendly video tutorials to click on or access through the website. Keep in mind, though, that Shapa is geared for people who want to lose or maintain weight/fat \u2014 it is not currently set up for those who want, or need, to gain. And it doesn\u2019t come cheap \u2014 the device costs $99 and the personalized app program is $7.99 per month. But, as of now, it is the only scale besides the one at my doctor\u2019s office that I am willing to step on.\n\nGood for: those who want to lose or maintain their weight and want the accountability and daily affirmation of weighing in without the angst that can come with it.", "description": "These approaches focus on how you feel and what your goals are.", "authors": ["Ellie Krieger", "Columnist", "Krieger Is A Registered Dietitian", "Nutritionist", "Author Who Hosts Public Television S", "Ellie S Real Good Food.", "She Blogs", "Offers A Weekly Newsletter At"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PFeMrx0PYIdK1im8RCFdY5Wa4dE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S3TTD6WWLQI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
