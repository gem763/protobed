China has been gradually opening up its stock markets in the past few years. Just this week it scrapped the quotas on two investment programs for foreign institutional investors. Shenzhen and Shanghai now boast a combined market capitalization of $7.5 trillion, nearly twice Hong Kong\u2019s.\n\nThird in a Series Even before protests shook Hong Kong this summer, there was widespread fatalism about its future as a financial and trade center. But Beijing\u2019s dependence on the \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d runs far deeper than it might appear. This series takes an in-depth look at the economic stakes for China and Hong Kong in the current upheaval. Hong Kong Is the Lung Through Which Chinese Banks Breathe\n\nHong Kong Is Unique\u2014China Needs It to Stay That Way\n\nChinese companies make up about 70% of the Hong Kong market, so losing their business to the mainland would be an existential threat. The almost $37 billion unsolicited bid made Wednesday by the city\u2019s stock-exchange operator, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing , 388 1.43% for its peer in London may have betrayed some unease.\n\nStill, Hong Kong\u2019s separate monetary and legal systems\u2014as long as they are maintained\u2014should secure its unique role as China\u2019s financial firewall. The city\u2019s unfettered capital flows and rule of law have allowed Chinese companies to tap foreign investors and pursue acquisitions abroad, while leaving China\u2019s own financial system relatively insulated.\n\nAnd while China\u2019s markets have been opening up, the pace of inflows has remained slow. Foreign investors only own about 3% of the stocks, which tend to be highly volatile, and more than half of that came through a trading link with Hong Kong itself. The so-called \u201cStock Connect\u201d has brought a cumulative 794 billion yuan ($112 billion) into mainland markets since its 2014 launch.\n\nChina has tried many times to create its own version of Nasdaq that might attract domestic, or even foreign, technology companies, but so far it hasn\u2019t been successful. Its latest attempt, Shanghai\u2019s STAR market, has just blown more bubbles.\n\nNew York in particular does compete with Hong Kong for initial public offerings. For Chinese companies wanting to tap foreign capital, though, Hong Kong remains the undisputed first choice. Over the past five years, nearly three-quarters of Chinese IPOs that haven\u2019t taken place on the Chinese mainland have been in Hong Kong, according to Dealogic.\n\nFlags flap outside the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Property developers and financial institutions are particularly big users of Hong Kong\u2019s capital markets: Between 2012 and 2018, about half of their equity financings, including secondary offerings and rights issues as well as IPOs, took place in Hong Kong, according to brokerage Natixis .\n\nWhile other global financial centers could probably serve Chinese companies\u2019 offshore needs\u2014Singapore has the most similar business model\u2014Hong Kong already has a cluster of Chinese investors and financial institutions that understand the country far better. Rising tensions between China and the U.S. may also give Chinese companies second thoughts about tapping American capital markets.\n\nAs long as Hong Kong stays open while mainland China remains relatively closed, the city will be China\u2019s only truly global financial center.\n\nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "description": "The city\u2019s stock market meets the needs of China\u2019s corporate sector in a way rivals cannot.", "authors": ["Jacky Wong", "Jacky.Wong Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106905/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
