As Boris Johnson tried in vain to defeat an opposition bill that would force him back to Brussels to ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline, he watched his majority slip away. Later, after calling for a general election, he punished Tory rebels by booting them out of the party and further reducing his numbers in the Commons.\n\nJoining Anushka Asthana behind the scenes in Westminster are the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, and chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot. She also hears from the furious former Tory MP Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, who had the party whip removed after his rebellion in Tuesday\u2019s vote; and from Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, as her party weighs up its desire for an election against its priority of stopping a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAlso today: Lily Kuo on the decision by Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, to formally withdraw an extradition bill that ignited months of protests and plunged the territory into its biggest political crisis in decades.", "description": "Anushka Asthana follows the Guardian\u2019s political correspondents in Westminster as they attempt to make sense of another seismic week in British politics.
