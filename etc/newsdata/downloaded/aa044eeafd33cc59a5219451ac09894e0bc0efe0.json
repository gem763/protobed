World Series goes to Game 7", "language": "en", "text": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Max Scherzer, this is your moment. And baseball fans, this is what you hoped for.\n\nBecause a World Series mostly devoid of drama suddenly involves the two most compelling words in sports: Game 7.\n\nMad Max, in so much pain over the weekend he could hardly move, starting for the Washington Nationals.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ready to go,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nZack Greinke, acquired by Houston in late July for exactly these situations, pitching for the Astros.\n\n\u201cA little excited about it at the moment, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d Greinke said.\n\nThe wild-card Nationals, trying to rewrite franchise history with their first championship. The Astros, aiming to build a legacy by taking their second crown in three years.\n\n\u201cMaybe not how we drew it up in terms of how we got there, but it doesn\u2019t take away the opportunity we have to win the World Series,\u201d Astros manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nA pair of teams that began spring training under sunny skies in February, working out side-by-side in the complex they share in Florida, now meeting in late October under the retractable roof at Minute Maid Park for the biggest prize of all.\n\nAnd this: What to expect from Scherzer on Wednesday night?\n\nUnable to pitch Game 5 on Sunday night because of nerve irritation near his neck that required a cortisone shot, the three-time Cy Young Award winner is set to start this all-or-nothing showdown.\n\nScherzer tossed in the outfield before Game 6 \u2014 a charged, 7-2 win by the Nationals \u2014 and even loosened up in the bullpen in the seventh inning Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said.\n\nBut whether the Game 1 winner, known for his incredible intensity, will be able to cut loose at full force, we\u2019ll soon find out.\n\n\u201cMax will pitch until his neck decides he can\u2019t pitch anymore,\u201d Martinez said before the game. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself telling Max, \u2018You\u2019re only going to go 75 pitches.\u2019 He\u2019s going to want to go out there and go as long as he can.\u201d\n\nIf Scherzer returns and wins, it might well go down in sports lore, along with Curt Schilling\u2019s bloody sock, Kirk Gibson hobbling around the bases and the night Willis Reed limped back on the court at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d probably make a movie about it. I bet, if he could, he could come back from the dead,\u201d teammate Adam Eaton said.\n\nIn the first World Series where the road team has taken the six first games, the Nationals meet an Astros team that led the majors with 107 victories.\n\nSo much for the home-field advantage.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like there is one right now, but I hope there\u2019s one tomorrow. We\u2019re waiting until the last game to have it on our side,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nEveryone available, probably.\n\nAstros ace Gerrit Cole, certainly. And maybe Justin Verlander after going five innings Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Game 7, all hands on deck. If AJ asks, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll figure out a way,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nHouston played in the previous Game 7 of the World Series, when George Springer and crew hammered Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium in 2017.\n\nRoad teams took the two prior Game 7s, too \u2014 Joe Maddon\u2019s Cubs at Cleveland in 2016 and Madison Bumgarner and the Giants at Kansas City in 2014.\n\nHealthy, Scherzer went 3-0 with a 2.16 ERA this postseason in four starts and one relief appearance.\n\nGreinke gave up one run over 4 2/3 innings in his first-ever World Series start when the Astros took Game 3. Acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline, the six-time All-Star is 0-2 with a 5.30 ERA in four starts this postseason.\n\nDid he ever imagine pitching a Game 7?\n\n\u201cProbably, but can\u2019t remember doing that at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nationals, meanwhile, tried everything to make the ailing Scherzer comfortable, especially on the flight from Washington back to Houston.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t do anything for 24 hours,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe put him in a neck brace. We sat him up in first class, so he had a lot of room.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Max Scherzer, this is your moment.
