That he explained has an impact on U.S. culture.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nCARLSON: Jason Whitlock is the host of \u201cSpeak for Yourself\u201d on Fox Sports One and he joins us tonight.\n\nSo Jason, this seems inexcusable behavior from the NBA. What\u2019s your view of it?\n\nJASON WHITLOCK, FOX SPORTS ONE HOST: Well, I think the cultural impact that China\u2019s influence over a great sport, a great American sport like basketball is just now being exposed at just how dependent the NBA is on the Chinese economy and Chinese money to put on the appearance of how great the league is doing. Without the Chinese money and without \u2014\n\nBecause you really have to understand the shoe companies \u2014 Nike, Adidas \u2014 they run American Basketball from the high school level all the way to the pros and the shoe companies are dependent on the China market and that\u2019s where all of this is coming from.\n\nYou see NBA players constantly over the summer, during their offseason, running to China, to do the bidding of their shoe companies and to sell their shoes in the China market. And so the NBA is really being exposed as not nearly as much of American business, as it is a global business, with China, perhaps having more influence over it than even America.\n\nCARLSON: Which is shocking, given that, of course \u2014 and shocking because I don\u2019t think most people know that.\n\nWHITLOCK: No.\n\nCARLSON: But also shocking given that the NBA was, of course, incubated in this country. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible in any other. Basketball was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts in a YMCA. It is the most American of all sports. And I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any basketball arena that wasn\u2019t subsidized by American taxpayers. So like, how could they possibly take this position?\n\nWHITLOCK: Tucker, the cultural impact of this, and what a great teachable moment it is for most Americans is when people start talking about being a global citizen, I don\u2019t think people really understand what that means for American culture.\n\nAnd I think for a lot of the everyday, typical American sports fan, this is an educational experience. This is what people have been talking about. We can\u2019t let our corporations, our country being totally driven by China because it\u2019s driving our culture.\n\nThese basketball players \u2014 LeBron James. James Harden, actually apologized on behalf of Daryl Morey to the Chinese government. We\u2019re apologizing to a communist government, and then we have athletes here and coaches like Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich that rail against our government. We\u2019re the bad guys in the minds of these NBA players and coaches and their little parade of being so woke, all of it to me is at the behest of the shoe companies.\n\nThey\u2019re doing the bidding of the shoe companies and protecting China and demonizing us and our culture and dramatically changing our culture. Because these athletes are young and I\u2019m not giving them an excuse, but they\u2019re young. Many of them didn\u2019t go to college or only spent a year or two in college. They don\u2019t understand how they are being used and played to promote a communist, a Marxist agenda.\n\nThey have no idea that their actions and a lot of the things they\u2019re promoting, this victim mentality and all the identity politics and oh, everything that America is racist \u2014 all of it. It\u2019s all a scam by the shoe companies.\n\nLook how socially aware we are, look how we fight against injustice. No, you\u2019re actually doing a marketing ploy to pretend you have a social conscience, and you\u2019re actually doing the bidding of the communist regime in China.\n\nCARLSON: Yes, maybe the single most racist government in the world. It\u2019s literally an ethno state. And here\u2019s the socially conscious NBA \u2014 very quick, it\u2019s a little shocking to me that Kerr of all people who never hesitates to give his opinion and is often lauded for it, can\u2019t manage to say that he takes Hong Kong\u2019s side?\n\nWHITLOCK: Tucker, these guys can rail against our government, our President and be applauded for it. They don\u2019t have the courage to speak out against a communist government, all kinds of human rights violations. It\u2019s the epitome of hypocrisy and cowardice.\n\nCARLSON: It really is. And thank you for putting it in context with the shoe companies. I think that\u2019s the most interesting thing I\u2019ve heard in a long time. Jason Whitlock. Great to see you tonight.\n\nWHITLOCK: Thank you.", "description": "Tuesday, during an appearance on Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" Fox Sports 1's \"Speak For Yourself\" co-host Jason Whitlock offered an in-depth analysis of the ongoing saga involving the National Basketball Association and the Chinese government. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Whitlock109-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
