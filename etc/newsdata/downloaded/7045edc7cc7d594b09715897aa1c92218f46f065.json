His nose was blocked with baked blood and he was barely breathing.\n\n\u2018We started changing his clothes and saw black bruises all over his body.\u2019\n\nDoctors are caring for the one-month-old in hospital (Picture: 1+1)\n\nThe neighbours called an ambulance and the police and the mother is now currently in police custody.\n\nHead of the intensive care unit of Rivne Regional Children\u2019s Hospital, Mykhailo Kulik, said: \u2018The boy is in a serious life-threatening condition.\n\n\u2018We suspect that his skull is fractured but we cannot examine it now.\n\n\u2018I have never seen a baby in such a terribly neglected state. I think his mother has never changed his clothes nor used diapers. His skin is in awful condition.\u2019\n\nThe mother, whose name has not been released, is being questioned by police (Picture: 1+1)\n\nThe mother was taken to the police station after she returned home from her date.\n\nShe has told police she did not touch Mykyta and his injuries were caused by a \u2018cold draft.\u2019\n\nPolice have launched a criminal case for battery and failure to fulfil parental duties against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe faces up to five years in jail if convicted.\n\nPolice spokesman Anton Kruk said: \u2018The mother said that she was stressed out because of the baby\u2019s constant crying.\n\n\u2018She left the baby home alone and went on a date.\u2019\n\nOnce the baby leaves hospital, he will be taken into the care of social services.", "description": "Warning: Graphic and upsetting content A newborn baby has been left in a serious condition after allegedly being beaten by his mother.
