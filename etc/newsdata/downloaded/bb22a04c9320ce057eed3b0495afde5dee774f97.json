(Photo by Drew Angerer, Getty Images)\n\nThe IMF has officially prescribed a carbon tax as the best way for governments around the world to meet their Paris Targets, five years after Australia scrapped its one.\n\nHowever, the IMF has said while a low tax might work for countries like China, due to its huge fossil fuel reserve Australia would need more than the maximum $US75 ($111) one it modelled.\n\nDespite the call, Australian politicians are unlikely to answer given the political toxicity of the issue domestically.\n\nIn Australia, there aren\u2019t two more loaded words in Australian politics than \u2018carbon tax\u2019.\n\nTony Abbott, who successfully snatched the keys to Kirribilli in 2013, ran very successful fear campaign against it. He would claim its abolition as one of his greatest achievements in office, slamming climate science as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), which works with governments to achieve economic growth, disagrees with Abbott\u2019s pointed assessment.\n\n\u201cThe longer that policy action is delayed, the more emissions will accumulate in the atmosphere and the greater the cost of stabilizing global temperatures \u2013 let alone of failing to\n\ndo so,\u201d the IMF said in a new report on how governments need to act on climate.\n\n\u201c[Carbon taxes] are the most powerful and efficient [strategy to mitigate emissions], because they allow firms and households to find the lowest-cost ways of reducing energy use and shifting toward cleaner alternatives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a groundbreaking statement. Even for the small window of time, Australia had a carbon tax, it did make a difference. National emissions fell 0.8% in its first year \u2013 the largest fall in 24 years of records \u2013 according to The Guardian.\n\nUnder its Paris target, Australia has committed to reduce greenhouse emissions by more than a quarter by 2030. While the IMF says carbon tax is the most effective way for governments to meet that target, Australia remains one of the hardest places to implement one due to its abundance of fossil fuels. Of three carbon tax prices, the IMF modelled, even the most expensive one \u2013 about $111 \u2013 wouldn\u2019t get Australia to where it needs to go.\n\n\u201cWhereas a $US25 a ton price would be more than enough for some countries \u2013 for example, China, India, and Russia \u2013 to meet their Paris Agreement pledges, in other cases \u2013 for example, Australia and Canada \u2013 even the $US75 a ton carbon tax falls short,\u201d it said.\n\nUnder that $US75 price, coal would become 263% more expensive. The price of natural gas would increase 44%, petrol by 15% and electricity by 75%. That\u2019s unlikely to win the tax many fans among the electorate, reducing the chances of an Australian government running with the $75 price, let alone a higher one.\n\nTo offset that pain, the IMF has recommended that the money raised from the tax be used to offset other taxes, lower electricity prices via greater investment in renewables, or pay it back to Australians as a dividend.\n\nBut despite the suggestion, it\u2019s unlikely that Australia will heed the call of the IMF. Since it helped sink \u2013 an admittedly already sinking \u2013 Labor government in 2012, it\u2019s gone on to prove as much of an issue on the other side of the aisle.\n\nConsider former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull who was forced to abandon his National Energy Guarantee (NEG) by his own party.\n\nPerhaps his experience from nearly a decade earlier was still ringing in his ears. In 2009, as leader of the federal opposition, he had stated his support for Labor\u2019s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS). One week later, he lost a party ballot and the prime ministership, to Abbott.\n\nGiven those cautionary tales, both major political parties look prepared to take their chances with the climate, thanks.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
