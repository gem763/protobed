Affirms Threat of White Supremacy After Years of Prodding", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is beginning to address white supremacist terrorism as a primary security threat, breaking with a decade of flagging attention after bigoted mass shooters from New Zealand to Texas took the lives of nearly 100 people in the last six months.\n\nIn a little-noticed strategy document published last month to guide law enforcement on emerging threats and in recent public appearances by Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, the department is trying to project a new vigilance about violent white nationalism, beating back criticism that the agency has spent a decade playing down the issue.\n\n\u201cI would like to take this opportunity to be direct and unambiguous in addressing a major issue of our time. In our modern age, the continuation of racially based violent extremism, particularly violent white supremacy, is an abhorrent affront to the nation,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said during an address last month, describing white nationalism as one of the most dangerous threats to the United States.\n\nThe department\u2019s new stance contrasts that of President Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed white supremacy as an insignificant fringe movement. But beyond words and documents, many officials trying to combat the threat throughout the country remain skeptical that the full weight of federal law enforcement is finally being used to give bigoted domestic terrorism the attention it deserves.", "description": "While President Trump has expressed skepticism about violent white nationalism in the past, his Department of Homeland Security is now highlighting the issue.", "authors": ["Zolan Kanno-Youngs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/us/politics/00dc-dhs2/00dc-dhs2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
