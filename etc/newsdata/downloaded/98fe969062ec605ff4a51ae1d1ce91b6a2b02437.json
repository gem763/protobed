Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarTlaib to join Sanders at campaign rally in Detroit AOC: Trump comparing impeachment inquiry to a lynching is 'atrocious' 2016 Sanders surrogate Lucy Flores endorses Warren MORE (D-Minn.) condemned Turkey\u2019s incursion into northeastern Syria following the U.S. withdrawal but warned sanctions against the nation would not solve the problem. The representative also noted sanctions could create new humanitarian issues in an op-ed for The Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims that he will levy harsh sanctions on Turkey if necessary and \u201cdestroy\u201d the nation\u2019s economy, Omar writes, are \u201can unmistakable echo of the failed U.S. strategy of \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on Iran and Venezuela. And just as with those two countries, it would be a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOmar continued to criticize sanctions as a method of foreign policy persuasion, because they have historically proven ineffective. She then cited research indicating that they rarely effect the desired change and often actively hurt the countries\u2019 civilians. \u201cAnd in the case of human-rights abusers, research suggests that more abuses typically occur with economic sanctions in place than without them,\u201d she adds.\n\nOmar also said sanctions are frequently used as a \u201clever without a plan for what comes after,\u201d citing recent sanctions on Iran that she writes have undone diplomatic process between the two nations and have largely affected the Iran\u2019s middle class, increasing anti-American sentiment.\n\nSimilarly, she wrote, \u201cthere\u2019s no question that the bulk of the economic crisis in Venezuela was caused by [President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro\u2019s government, which inherited fixable problems and failed to address them. But U.S. sanctions have worsened Venezuela\u2019s economic disaster \u2014 and handed Maduro a propaganda victory. He can now shift blame to the United States, while retaining his grip on power.\u201d\n\nOmar added that there have historically been cases where sanctions have been effective, including locally-organized boycott movements such as those against South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime, but that economic and sector sanctions are \u201ctoo often designed to inflict maximum pain on civilians, not empower them.\u201d\n\nInstead, Omar recommended strategies such as a ban on weapons sales to Turkey or the negotiation of a buffer zone in northern Syria, and that addressing the issues will require policies that do not \u201cprioritize warfare\u2014whether military or economic.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
