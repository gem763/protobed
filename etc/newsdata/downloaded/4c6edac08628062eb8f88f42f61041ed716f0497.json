Add Democratic Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Democratic Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also going to do third-party again. And I\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far...\" Clinton told David Plouffe on \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d, a podcast run by the 2008 Obama campaign manager.\n\nClinton does not mention Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard by name and there are five Democratic women running for president this cycle: Gabbard, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Kloubuchar, California Sen. Kamala Harria and author Marianne Williamson. However, the comment appeared to be aimed at Gabbard.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nGabbard fired back on Twitter on Friday afternoon.\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nThe Hawaiian lawmaker recently addressed criticism that her campaign is being aided by Russian propaganda efforts-- a narrative that has appeared recently in such places as the New York Times. The news outlet reported last week that some Democrats worry about Russian bot influence due to Gabbard's apparent popularity on and mentions in Russian news media and on such places as 4chan, an online message board popular with right-wing groups.\n\nClinton's spokesman Nick Merrill told CNN in response to a question about whether the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard: \"If the nesting doll fits.\"\n\n\"This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality,\" Merrill told CNN. \"If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.\"\n\nGabbard addressed speculation about being boosted by Russia on ABC's \"This Week\" in May, after being asked about an article published in The Daily Beast titled \"Tulsi Gabbard's Campaign Is Being Boosted by Putin Apologists.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast article said that Gabbard's campaign was being \"underwritten by some of the nation's leading Russophiles,\" and highlighted donations from supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The piece says that those donors' views are likely to align more closely with Gabbard's on subjects like Syria. As a member of Congress, she has met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and criticized a U.S. strike against the Syrian government, receiving backlash from other Democrats in Congress.\n\n\"You know, it's unfortunate that you're citing that article, George, because it's a whole lot of fake news,\" Gabbard said. \"What I am focused on is what is in the best interest of the American people. What is in the best interest of our national security. Keeping the American people safe.\"\n\nClinton's team has not responded to a request from ABC News for comment.\n\nABC News has also reached out to Gabbard's campaign for a response.\n\nGabbard has previously said on multiple occasions that she will not run as a third-party candidate should she fail to net the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nLast week, Gabbard threatened to boycott the fourth Democratic debate, hosted by CNN and the New York times, accusing them of \u201crigging\u201d the 2020 election.\n\n\"I am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media's effort to rig 2020 primary,\" she tweeted.\n\nI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary.

All your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the \u201cneutral\u201d questioners/ moderators of Tuesday\u2019s debate lol\u201d\n\nAs if to prove my point, NYT just published a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d smear piece.

They know they can't win without a third-party candidate, and so I don't know who it's going to be, but I will guarantee they'll have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.\"\n\nStein, in a response to ABC News on Friday evening, said: \"Instead of addressing the crises working people face, the DNC is painting progressives as the enemy. It's as if they're trying to lose to Trump again...In light of the latest slanderous allegations from Hillary Clinton, I challenge her to a debate. It's past time to give the American people the real debate they deserved in 2016, but were denied by the phony DNC/RNC-controlled Commission on Presidential Debates.\"\n\nSome of Gabbard's Democratic competitors weighed in on Twitter, too. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker tweeted a GIF in response to Gabbard.", "description": "Hillary Clinton, without naming names -- and just ahead of the debate -- said that a female 2020 candidate is a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/hillary-ap-aa-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
