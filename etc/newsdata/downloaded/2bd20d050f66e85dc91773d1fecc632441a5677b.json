Police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun declined to comment. Turkey's Embassy in Phnom Penh did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nErdogan blames Gulen for the coup attempt and has demanded the extradition of various people tied to Gulen's movement - including staff at schools it funded worldwide. Gulen denies any connection with the abortive putsch.\n\nAt its peak, the Gulen movement operated schools in 160 countries, from Afghanistan to the United States. Since the coup attempt, Turkey has pressured allies to shut down Gulen-run establishments.\n\nIn Turkey's three-year purge since the coup attempt, more than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial and about 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs.\n\nAnkara has defended the clampdown as a necessary response to the scale of the security threat which Turkey faces, vowing to eradicate Gulen's network.\n\nKaraca, who was born in Turkey and holds a Mexican passport, was director of Zaman school until it was sold last year and has since working as an educational consultant for the school, his wife said.\n\nNicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific, urged the Cambodian authorities to either bring Karaca promptly before a judge or release him immediately.
