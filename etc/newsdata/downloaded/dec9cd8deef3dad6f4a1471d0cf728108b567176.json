A representative for Ciena did not respond to a request for comment. The SEC and the Justice Department declined to comment. The investigations trace back to a voluntary disclosure that Ciena made to the agencies in 2017. In a prior securities filing, Ciena said that one of its third-party vendors had alleged that questionable payments had been made to at least one individual employed by a customer in Southeast Asia. The company conducted an internal investigation into the allegations, which corroborated that payments had been made to one such individual, Ciena said.
