Once I got into the flow of competing and feeling the round, it just got exciting. We were competitive, the banter was great, the back and forth.\u201d\n\nWoods took home five skins and $60,000, matching the money won by Rory McIlroy for four skins. Playing in his homeland, Hideki Matsuyama earned just one skin and $20,000 at Narashino Country Club.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDay sealed his win with a nice up-and-down under the lights at No. 18, his closing birdie netting him another $100,000.\n\nThe up and down that made Jason Day your #TheChallengeJapanSkins champion. \ud83c\udfc6 pic.twitter.com/g7r5N6ELCI \u2014 GOLFTV (@GOLFTV) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cFirst time I\u2019ve ever finished under lights, so that was exciting,\u201d Day said, who added a playful dig at Woods for never winning a televised skins competition over the course of his career.\n\nDay also had some fun with Woods at No. 4, which like the rest of the holes on the course features two greens (Japanese courses often feature two greens on every hole to keep one fresh at all times). Woods\u2019s approach landed between the two greens, prompting Day to ask him which green he was going for.\n\n\u201cI hit in between the greens, so it looked kind of like I kind of didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d Woods said.\n\nAD\n\nWoods said Monday that his knee bothered him throughout the 2019 season, which he started with memorable win at the Masters but ended with a string of noncompetitive finishes. After not qualifying for the season-ending Tour Championship, Woods elected to have surgery on his left knee to repair minor cartilage damage, his fifth such operation, on Aug. 20.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt progressively got worse and got to where it was affecting even reading putts,\u201d Woods said. \u201cYou could see toward the end of the year I wasn\u2019t getting down on my putts well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice to be able to squat down and read putts and start going at it full speed again,\u201d Woods continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just been wear-and-tear over the years. It\u2019s just been stressed out for a very long time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWoods will stay in Japan for this week\u2019s Zozo Championship, the first official PGA Tour event to be held in that country. After that tournament, his next chore will be captaining the U.S. Presidents Cup team against a group of international players in December. Woods will announce his four at-large selections on Nov. 7, though he hinted in a blog post last month that he will be choosing himself for one of those slots.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to be fit and ready for the end of the year,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBeen battling through this year. Nice to get over the hump and start feeling good again and go at it full speed.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Woods relished the chance to get back on the course, however.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bQhOx1dmteHqna2OK9mrUU1n67c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EPVPISXT5QI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
