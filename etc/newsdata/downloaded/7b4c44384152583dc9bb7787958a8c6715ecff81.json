The service, already in place in 19 other countries, will allow customers to opt to pay with cash upon checkout when shopping at the online retailer.\n\nCustomers who pay with PayCode are given a code upon checkout, which they will be able to take to any Western Union and settle with cash. Their online order will ship after Western Union transfers the money to Amazon.\n\nThe service builds on Amazon Cash, an existing service that allows users to load cash onto their Amazon account by visiting a participating bank.\n\nPayCode will allow Amazon to move in on the market of customers who are unwilling or unable to pay for online orders with credit or ATM cards, potentially widening their business.\n\nThe new service will begin to go into effect in the coming weeks, according to an Amazon announcement.", "description": "Amazon is rolling out a new program called PayCode that will give its customers in the US the option to pay with cash.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8154642e22af542b083307-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
