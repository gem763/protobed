AB InBev did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are the sponsors of the float.", "description": "Anheuser-Busch InBev is planning to raise about $5 billion from a revived float of its Asian operations after the world's largest beer maker shelved a Hong Kong IPO in July, people with knowledge of the matter said.", "authors": ["Julie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428850941&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1XJ", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
