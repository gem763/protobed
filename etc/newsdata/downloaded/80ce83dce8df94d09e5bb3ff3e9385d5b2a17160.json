There are two kinds of stroke: 1. ISCHEMIC STROKE An ischemic stroke - which accounts for 80 percent of strokes - occurs when there is a blockage in a blood vessel that prevents blood from reaching part of the brain. 2. HEMORRHAGIC STROKE The more rare, a hemorrhagic stroke, occurs when a blood vessel bursts, flooding part of the brain with too much blood while depriving other areas of adequate blood supply. It can be the result of an AVM, or arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal cluster of blood vessels), in the brain. Thirty percent of subarachnoid hemorrhage sufferers die before reaching the hospital. A further 25 percent die within 24 hours. And 40 percent of survivors die within a week. RISK FACTORS Age, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, family history, and history of a previous stroke or TIA are all risk factors for having a stroke. SYMPTOMS OF A STROKE Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body\n\nSudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding\n\nSudden trouble seeing or blurred vision in one or both eyes\n\nSudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination\n\nSudden severe headache with no known cause OUTCOMES Of the roughly three out of four people who survive a stroke, many will have life-long disabilities. This includes difficulty walking, communicating, eating, and completing everyday tasks or chores. TREATMENT Both are potentially fatal, and patients require surgery or a drug called tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) within three hours to save them.\n\nIn the US, about 795,000 people have strokes annually and some 140,000 of them die \u2013 about one out of every 20 deaths is caused by stroke.\n\nAs well as a link between stroke and traffic noise in the neighbourhood, the Barcelona researchers also found green space around the home played a part.\n\nPeople living with at least 984 feet (300m) of green space around their street had a 25 per cent lower chance of suffering a severe stroke than those who didn't.\n\nThe risks were relative, meaning someone in a noisy area didn't have a one-in-three chance of having a stroke, just a 30 per cent higher risk than someone in a quiet area (for example, a rise from one in 10,000 risk to 1.3 in 10,000).\n\nIn their paper the researchers, led by Dr Rosa Vivanco-Hidalgo, couldn't explain how noise pollution may raise the risk of a stroke.\n\nThey said: 'Road traffic noise has also been related with adverse [heart] outcomes, but few studies have assessed the influence on stroke, suggesting that traffic noise might play a [harmful] role increasing its risk.\n\n'There are no studies, though, testing specifically its effect in acute ischemic stroke severity.\n\n'A possible mechanism that could explain the association is that noise may also lead to endothelial dysfunction and arterial hypertension.'\n\nEndothelial dysfunction is the failure of cells inside the blood vessels to work properly, while arterial hypertension is high blood pressure.\n\nDamage to the insides of blood vessels \u2013 such as that caused by high blood pressure \u2013 can lead to stroke by making it more likely a blood clot will develop.\n\nThis clot can then break loose and travel through the bloodstream to the head or neck, where it may block the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain.\n\nAnother possibility raised in the study was that the traffic noise was simply a sign of someone living in an urban area without much green space.\n\nDr Vivanco-Hidalgo and her team suggested being closer to green space might help people be less stressed, more physically active and develop healthier immune systems and circulation.\n\nThey didn't find a link between the levels of certain types of pollution \u2013 PM2.5 \u2013 and how severe someone's stroke was.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Environmental Research.", "description": "Researchers in Barcelona analysed records of more than 2,700 stroke victims in Spain and also found that having a 984-foot (300m) 'buffer' of green space around the home reduced stroke risk.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/17/10/18570226-0-image-a-6_1568712004942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
