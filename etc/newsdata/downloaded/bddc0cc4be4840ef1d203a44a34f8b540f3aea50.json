We know how many people died in the incident.\n\n\"Perhaps what we don\u2019t look at is what would have happened if we changed the policy. People may still have died and been injured.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"The inquiry might then have said 'why did you change the policy from stay put?' It's been well tested for years and years.\n\n\"The London Fire Brigade have more high rises than anywhere in the country, The fire brigade is well versed in tackling high rise fires. In the run of the mill they don\u2019t cause any problems.\"\n\nHolly, who was also joined by survivor Miguel Alves interrupted and hit back by insisting Grenfell was not a \"run of the mill\" fire.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe said: \"But this wasn\u2019t run of the mill. And as Miguel just said his instinct, not with any expertise in fire at all, instinctively he looked at that and went 'I need to get out'. Instinctively people can\u2019t see why it wasn\u2019t changed.\"\n\nBob replied: \"I understand from his point of view and people looking on from the side. What would you have done? I remember seeing that on the TV and thinking what would I do if I turned up in a fire engine? What would my priorities be?\"\n\nBob continued to reiterate that the 50-year-old building was built on a \"principle of compartmentation\" and it was a \"unique situation\".\n\nHe said that the blame lied with the cladding and building regulations \"without a shadow of a doubt\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThey were joined by survivor Miguel Alves and his daughter, who took her chemistry GCSE on the morning of the fire.\n\nHe went up to the 13th floor to wake up his wife and kids and saved everyone else on that level.\n\nMiguel said: \"Justice is that a second Grenfell doesn\u2019t happen again. That's the most important thing.\n\n\"People won\u2019t die for a reason. We have to change in the future. We should not be living in that death trap.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Grenfell Tower survivor Miguel Alves told the This Morning hosts he instinctively knew the 'stay put' policy was wrong", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757837.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_301019TM_7139JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
