She appeared in her first film, the now classic \"Carmen Jones,\" starring Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge, that same year.\n\nCarroll performed in Las Vegas and released several albums early on, including \"Diahann Carroll Sings Harold Arlen\" (1957), \"Diahann Carroll and Andre Previn \"(1960) and \"The Fabulous Diahann Carroll (1962).\"\n\nIt was on Broadway, however, where Carroll hit her stride.\n\nShe became the first African-American woman to win a Tony for best actress when she snagged the coveted award for her portrayal as Barbara Woodruff in the 1962 musical \"No Strings.\"\n\nShe went on to receive an Oscar nomination for the 1974 movie \"Claudine,\" in which she starred opposite James Earl Jones.\n\nCarroll once again changed the television landscape in the 1980s when she became the first major African-American character on a primetime soap in \"Dynasty.\"\n\nCarroll in 'Dynasty' in 1987.

I like that very much because I think very often, particularly minorities, it's almost required of them that they are nice people.\"\n\nCarroll's personal life was no less glamorous.\n\nShe was married four times: to record producer Monte Kay from 1956 to 1963 during which time they had a daughter, Suzanne; briefly to Las Vegas boutique owner Fred Glusman in 1973; to Jet magazine managing editor Robert DeLeon from 1975 until his death two years later in a car crash; and to singer Vic Damone from 1987 to 1996.\n\nIn the 1990s, Carroll won a new legion of fans playing Whitney Gilbert's mother, Marion, on \"A Different World\" and the new millennium found Carroll appearing on multiple TV shows, including \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Diary of a Single Mom.\"\n\nHer last credited role was as Miss Edna in the 2016 film \"The Masked Saint.\"\n\nCarroll is survived by her daughter and her grandchildren, August and Sydney", "description": "Diahann Carroll, who pioneered television with her starring role in the 1968 series \"Julia,\" died Friday, her daughter Suzanne Kay confirmed to CNN.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191004121024-01-diahann-carroll-lead-image-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
