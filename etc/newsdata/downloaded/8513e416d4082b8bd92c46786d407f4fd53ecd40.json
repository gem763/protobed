Niantic\u2019s apps certainly encourage gamers to get outdoors and get active, but behind the scenes, Wizards Unite is quietly casting another spell: collecting a surprising amount of data about where you go.\n\nWizards Unite is an augmented reality mobile game developed by Niantic in partnership with Warner Brothers. Millions of people play the game \u2014 not nearly as many as Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s impressive 150 million active users in 2018, two years after launch, but on release, it rocketed to the top of the app store with hundreds of thousands of downloads.\n\nNiantic\u2019s apps regularly dominate app stores, just as the company itself dominates the world of augmented reality gaming. They\u2019re the latest products from a cell of technologists that\u2019s been in operation since 2001, being acquired by and then spun off from Google, while never losing sight of its ultimate goal: to map the entire world digitally and capitalise on that data.\n\nToday, when you use Wizards Unite or Pok\u00e9mon Go or any of Niantic\u2019s other apps, your every move is getting documented and stored \u2014 up to 13 times a minute, according to the results of a Kotaku investigation. Even players who know that the apps record their location data are usually astonished once they look at just how much they\u2019ve told Niantic about their lives through their footsteps.\n\nFor years, users of these technologists\u2019 products \u2014 from Google Street View to Pok\u00e9mon Go \u2014 have been questioning how far they\u2019re going with users\u2019 information and whether those users are adequately educated on what they\u2019re giving up and with whom it\u2019s shared. In the process, those technologists have made mistakes, both major and minor, with regards to user privacy.\n\nAs Niantic summits the world of augmented reality, it\u2019s engineering that future of that big-money field, too. Should what Niantic does with its treasure trove of valuable data remain shrouded in the darkness particular to up-and-coming Silicon Valley darlings, that opacity might become so normalized that users lose any expectation of knowing how they\u2019re being profited from.\n\n\u201cIn every neighbourhood, there\u2019s probably a story that\u2019s interesting. There\u2019s a mystery that can be built here. It\u2019s this idea of exploration,\u201d said Niantic\u2019s founder and CEO John Hanke during a talk at the 2019 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Dressed down in a red Niantic T-shirt, his trademark swoop of brown-grey hair across his temple, he described the tripartite mission of his company: Exploration. Exercise. Social.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a parent with kids,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you become a parent it\u2019s like you have a second chance, you can reset. I was thinking of all the places I wanted to go and explore with my kids. We started Niantic with those themes in mind.\u201d Pok\u00e9mon Go players have walked a collective 14.3 billion miles since its release in July 2016.\n\nIf the new, and similar, Wizards Unite has the same staying power, perhaps its players will cover similar ground in the years to come. (During the course of reporting this story over several months, Kotaku attempted multiple times to secure an interview with Hanke. Niantic never granted us an interview with its CEO in person or by phone, but Hanke did eventually provide us with emailed responses to some of our questions.)\n\nIn his GDC talk, Hanke continued on to describe another one of Niantic\u2019s goals, one that may read as innocuous to starry-eyed \u201890s kids who wanted nothing more than a Pok\u00e9-pal to travel with: \u201cto build stuff that brings the digital and physical world together.\u201d\n\nDepending on how you\u2019re looking at it, that can mean an immersive Pok\u00e9mon experience or, in Hanke\u2019s terms, \u201cubiquitous computing,\u201d which he said in 2016 meant adding \u201ccomputing interfaces to everything you encounter in the physical world.\u201d\n\nJohn Hanke. (Photo: Steve Jennings, Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThis is about being able to walk around with glasses and know more about the world,\u201d said Hanke at his 2019 GDC talk. \u201cYou might walk by a restaurant and understand what Yelp has to say about that restaurant,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is a possible future that we might live in.\u201d\n\nUbiquitous computing isn\u2019t sitting at your desktop playing World of Warcraft for 13 hours, or even using your phone to navigate from your friend\u2019s house to the nearest liquor store. It\u2019s the seamless integration of the digital world into the physical one, anywhere, at any time. Also referred to as \u201cmediated reality,\u201d ubiquitous computing, to some, is the science fiction fantasy of Star Trek, where tasks are mediated by an objective, neutral computation system. It was the vision of Google Glass, the $2,200 device that, through voice commands, could take photos, search on Google, view your calendar or receive travel alerts. Google Glass never caught on, although in his talk, Hanke was adamant that the future of AR is wearable technology.\n\nAt 2019\u2019s GDC, Hanke showed a video titled \u201cHyper-Reality,\u201d by the media artist Keiichi Matsuda. It\u2019s a dystopian look at a future in which the entire world is slathered with virtual overlays, an assault on the senses that everyone must view through an AR headset if they want to participate in modern society. In the video, the protagonist\u2019s entire field of vision is a spread of neon notifications, apps, and advertisements, all viewed from a seat at the back of a city bus.\n\nTheir hands swipe across a game they\u2019re playing in augmented reality, while in the background an ad for Starbucks Coffee indicates they won a coupon for a free cup. Push notifications in their periphery indicate three new messages and directions for where to exit the bus.\n\nWalking through the aisle, where digital \u201cget off now!\u201d signs indicate it\u2019s their stop, and onto the street, the physical world is annotated with virtual information. The more tasks they accomplish, the more points they receive. The whole world is now one big game. It showed a definitively dystopian vision of a world in which the barriers between IRL and URL have been fully collapsed.\n\nHanke said that the video made him feel \u201cstressed and nervous.\u201d Calling it a work of \u201ccritical design,\u201d he noted that it was meant to question this dystopian future for AR, \u201ca world where you\u2019re tracked everywhere you go, where giant companies know everything about you, your identity is constantly at stake, and the world itself is noisy, and busy and plastered with distractions.\u201d\n\nBut when a path appeared in front of the video\u2019s protagonist showing them where to walk, Hanke\u2019s response was: \u201cThat looks helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people would say AR is a bad thing because we\u2019ve seen this vision of how bad it can be,\u201d Hanke said. \u201cThe point I want to make to you all is, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d He showed an image of the Ferry Building, the 120-year-old piece of classical revival architecture in San Francisco where the company is currently headquartered.\n\nJust like in the video, it was overlaid with augmented reality windows showing the building\u2019s history, a public transit schedule, and tabs for nearby restaurants. Hanke described a world where people can better navigate public transit and understand their surroundings because of digital mapping initiatives like Niantic.\n\nHe talked about the possibility of hologram tour guides in San Francisco, and how they\u2019d rely on a digital map to navigate their surroundings, and about designing shared experiences of Pok\u00e9mon games in a Pok\u00e9mon-augmented world. Cute, nice things for nice people who love cute things.\n\nUbiquitous computing is still a fantasy, but not because the technology isn\u2019t ready. It is. The fantasy is that any system mediating someone\u2019s personal experience of the physical world that uses a modern corporation\u2019s digital infrastructure would be objective or neutral. Humans are data and data is money, and this is the business model of many of the technology firms up to the task of ubiquitous computing.\n\nDespite Hanke\u2019s apparent cognizance of how, in the wrong hands, location-based AR apps can intrude and prey on reality, it remains to be seen whether the globe-sized snowball he\u2019d started rolling at the dawn of his career in mapping and location tech is one that any one man could stop himself.\n\nPhoto: Amr Alfiky, AP\n\nNiantic\u2019s headquarters in the Ferry Building are located just a few blocks down from what remains of its namesake, a former whaling vessel from the mid-1800s. Known for ferrying entrepreneurs to California during the gold rush, the Niantic was eventually brought aground in San Francisco and turned into a hotel. The hotel is gone, but the hull of the Niantic remains buried under the streets of modern San Francisco, a plaque marking its location. The plaque is now a Pok\u00e9mon Go gym.\n\nJohn Hanke\u2019s takeaway from the story of the ship buried beneath the skyscrapers, as he explained it in a 2016 talk to the Berkeley School of Business, was that \u201cthere was this hidden information out in the world,\u201d and he wanted to develop \u201ctechnologies can help you learn about these things as you move about in the physical world.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1967 and raised in the tiny thousand-person town of Cross Plains, Texas, Hanke found a bag full of National Geographic magazines as a child and fell in love with the maps \u2014 the Nile Delta, the far East \u2014 which he saw as a way of exploring far-away places from the isolation of his small town. Later, Hanke would buy himself a computer with the money he\u2019d earned mowing lawns.\n\nIn lieu of taking over his father\u2019s small ranch operation, Hanke focused his attention on school, where he would win a statewide computer programming competition. (Hanke\u2019s biography is laid out in the 2018 behind-the-scenes book Never Lost Again, a history of Google Maps written by Keyhole/Google/Niantic executive Bill Kilday. When Kotaku asked whether that biographical information was accurate, Hanke said that he had not read the entire book.)\n\nAfter a brief post-college stint with the U.S. Foreign Service, Hanke joined the game developer Archetype Interactive and shipped Meridian 59, the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game with 3D graphics. Later, after getting his MBA from the University of California Berkeley, Hanke was tapped to lead a company developing state-of-the-art mapping technology using satellite imaging and aerial photography.\n\nKeyhole, named for the reconnaissance satellites that the United States used starting in 1959 to spy on other countries, did mapping better than anything before it. Keyhole reinvented mapping for the digital era of the early 2000s. Hanke\u2019s mission, he said at GDC 2019, was to \u201cbuild a map to put the whole world on your desktop\u201d \u2014 an audacious vision in 2001, when the cutting edge of computer mapping was printing out MapQuest directions and hoping for the best.\n\nThe CIA\u2019s venture capital investment firm, In-Q-Tel, took a particular interest in Keyhole. According to a 2003 press release, within two weeks of In-Q-Tel\u2019s investment, Keyhole\u2019s tech was implemented to support Pentagon initiatives in Iraq.\n\nIn-Q-Tel\u2019s leader at the time was Gilman Louie, a video game industry veteran who\u2019d designed or produced a handful of flight simulators, including the Falcon series. Louie, who currently sits on the board of Niantic and whose venture capital firm is a major investor in the company, has had a decades-long relationship with Hanke, apparently fuelled by their shared enthusiasm for mapping and augmented reality.\n\nKeyhole also proved seductive to Google, whose cofounder Sergey Brin led the initiative to acquire Keyhole for a reported $52 million in 2004.\n\nGoogle began to buy up other mapping tech companies, especially ones in the business of taking aerial or 3D images of cities around the world. According to Never Lost Again, it took a while for Keyhole employees to realise that its new parent company had grand plans to map the whole entire world in 3D, and make it searchable.\n\nA screenshot from Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. (Screenshot: Niantic)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall them articulating a pre-existing desire to digitally map the world in the way you describe,\u201d said Hanke via email when Kotaku asked whether the account was accurate. \u201cI remember Google executives (during our pre-acquisition meetings) being very excited about the vision we described to them of creating an \u2018earth browser\u2019 to explore information using the earth itself as the discovery mechanism.\u201d Hanke would help head up Google Geo, the name for Google\u2019s map, Street View, and Earth projects.\n\nThe February 2005 launch of Google Maps, soon followed by the launch of Google Earth, were met with falling-over-itself fanfare from the California techies. It was the first free, interactive, global visual map of Earth. In its first 24 hours, Google Earth was downloaded 450,000 times.\n\nUsers were overwhelmed by the opportunity to be at the helm of a digital starship that could land basically anywhere. Foreign governments trembled, citing concerns that private military facilities would be discovered. (\u201cThey ought to have asked us,\u201d said India\u2019s surveyor general to the New York Times.) For his part, in interviews, Hanke leaned into the good Google Earth was doing, like facilitating wildfire mitigation or hurricane relief efforts.\n\nGoogle Earth and its cousins were also immediately the darling of big brands. Target painted its logo on some of its stores\u2019 rooftops so they could be seen from the overhead view. Volkswagen worked with Hanke to convert Google\u2019s maps into in-car navigation modules.\n\nBy April of 2004, before Keyhole was even acquired by Google, Google was looking into marketing Google\u2019s Search by Location function to advertisers. Now, businesses could target ads geographically. This was over ten years ago, and the birthing process for this advanced form of surveillance capitalism is still in its experimentation stages.\n\nThose methods were apparently so important that their inception involved several of the most important people at the company. As the story goes in Never Lost Again, it was Google co-founder Larry Page who first took his car and a camcorder out one Saturday to California\u2019s Half Moon Bay, with Sergey Brin and the head of Google\u2019s search team Marissa Mayer in the back seat.\n\nThis C-suite road trip would eventually result in a fleet of Google vans that by 2009 would map 13 million miles of the physical world across 22 countries. Homes, mailboxes, front lawns, bikini-clad sunbathers \u2014 Google grabbed it all.\n\nIn 2010, Germany\u2019s data protection commission noticed something shady about Google\u2019s fleet of image-vacuuming vans. Their sensors were eating, or \u201csniffing,\u201d traffic from wireless networks that were unencrypted, and in the process, scooping up emails, medical information, financial records, audio and video files and passwords.\n\nHanke, still in charge of Google Geo, said he didn\u2019t know anything about it. Google later apologised, saying it had \u201cmistakenly included code in our software that collected samples of payload data from WiFi networks.\u201d\n\nAs the 2018 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism explains it, Google did know something about it: \u201cThe records showed that the engineer had emailed links to his software documentation to project leaders, who then shared them with the entire Street View team. [The FCC] also found evidence that on at least two occasions, the engineer told his colleagues that Street View was collecting personal data.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201cWi-Spy scandal\u201d made waves across watchdog blogs and tech media. \u201cAsking Google to educate consumers about privacy is like asking the fox to teach the chickens how to ensure the security of their coop,\u201d wrote Consumer Watchdog. Data was becoming the pillar of tech companies\u2019 business strategies, and legitimately or not, consumers began fearing that their information was, in fact, the actual commodity these companies dealt in. (Never Lost Again completely omits the event from its history of Google Maps.)\n\nPhoto: Charley Gallay, Getty Images\n\n\u201cAfter the mapping part was done, we kind of turned to the next obvious question,\u201d said Hanke in a 2019 speech. \u201cYou have this amazing service, this unprecedented amount of detail about the planet. What other kinds of things could you build with it?\u201d By 2010, the year of the \u201cWi-Spy\u201d scandal, Hanke was growing frustrated in his position as a vice president of Geo. He pivoted to launching Niantic Labs as an internal startup within the Google mothership.\n\n\u201cIf you have mobile computing and services people are using while moving around in the world,\u201d said Hanke in a 2016 talk to the Berkeley School of Business, \u201cthe question we asked ourselves was, \u2018Could these services influence how people behave in the physical world? Could the products they\u2019re using cause them to walk a different path, drive a different path, divert from the trajectory that they\u2019re normally going to go on? If you could do that through information services that you\u2019re offering to people, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity for businesses that might want to change the behaviour of people to get them to go places where they wouldn\u2019t otherwise go.\u201d He added: \u201cWe were also interested in being an advertising company.\u201d\n\nNiantic Labs\u2019 first app was called \u201cField Trip.\u201d Developed primarily for Google Glass, it would pop up interesting factoids about landmarks and locations around you as you wandered. Hanke called it an example of \u201cubiquitous computing.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re out walking with your family, you\u2019re not going to pause every 6.10m and do a Google search,\u201d he said in a 2012 interview with the Mercury News.\n\n\u201cSo the notion is that you can have this process that runs in the background that knows something about where you are, and about your interests. It can proactively offer up information that can help you have a richer experience but in a way that\u2019s seamless and doesn\u2019t interrupt the flow of your activity.\u201d You don\u2019t even have to unlock your phone.\n\n\u201cNiantic was created to explore applications for various kinds of wearable computing devices that we believed would some day replace the mobile phone,\u201d Hanke told Kotaku. But Niantic quickly shifted focus to phone games starting with 2012's Ingress. Niantic\u2019s games would all be location-based, augmented-reality experiences, games that sought to collapse the barrier between the digital and the physical. Niantic would crowdsource cultural and physical landmarks from players and spin them into gameplay mechanics.\n\nIn Ingress, \u201cagents\u201d (players) use their \u201cscanners\u201d (cell phones) to overtake \u201cportals\u201d (specific IRL landmarks), in a game of hacker capture-the-flag. The groundbreaking game still sustains a medium-sized, dedicated following. Niantic spun out from Google in 2015, with Google setting it up with some seed money. A generous investment from The Pokemon Company and Nintendo helped. A year later, the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Go would be three times bigger than those of Google Maps and Google Earth.\n\nSince its 2016 release, Pok\u00e9mon Go has netted over $3 billion. In it, players collect items from PokeStops \u2014 also real-life locations and landmarks \u2014 so they can catch and collect Pok\u00e9mon, which spawn around them. Almost immediately, Pok\u00e9mon Go sparked its own privacy controversy, also blamed on a bug, which involved users giving Niantic a huge number of permissions: contacts, location, storage, camera and, for iPhone users, full Google account access, which was not integral to gameplay.\n\nMinnesota senator Al Franken penned a strongly-worded letter to Niantic about it, expressing concern \u201cabout the extent to which Niantic may be unnecessarily collecting, using, and sharing a wide range of users\u2019 personal information without their appropriate consent.\u201d Niantic said that the \u201caccount creation process on iOS erroneously requests full access permission,\u201d adding that Pok\u00e9mon Go only got user ID and email address info.\n\nThree years later, Niantic would release Wizards Unite, an augmented reality game where players collect \u201cConfoundables\u201d around their neighbourhood, fight enemies with magic, and interact with location-locked resources like inns and greenhouses. What makes Wizards Unite an \u201caugmented reality\u201d game is the fact that, when a player encounters something magical they must deal with in-game, the phone\u2019s camera turns on.\n\nIn the foreground of the player\u2019s office desk, commuter train, or neighbourhood street, some Harry Potter-ish object or monster appears. Between these encounters, the game idly follows the player as they walk down the street, which is dotted with magical, interactable things.\n\nRunning all of these games is what Niantic calls its Real World Platform, an \u201coperating system\u201d that allows other developers to build their own apps and games that use all of the work that Niantic has already done in mapping and tagging the world. Niantic hopes that eventually other developers will make more games using its Real World Platform, leading to a proliferation of its tech.\n\n\u201cI think you can create over time more and more types of applications utilising our platform in the future,\u201d said Niantic\u2019s vice president of product management, Kei Kawai. \u201cRight now, our focus is more on the game.\u201d In the future, Niantic says on their website they\u2019re planning on releasing a \u201cplanet-scale real-world AR platform,\u201d which would more believably integrate game experiences into a live camera feed of the real world.\n\nA map created with points of location data collected by Niantic from a Harry Potter: Wizards Unite player. (Image: Kotaku)\n\nFrom the player\u2019s perspective, the Wizarding World is manifesting itself into their real one. But what\u2019s happening behind the scenes, and what does Niantic see? Players give Wizards Unite permission to track their movement using a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile cell tower triangulation.\n\nTo understand the extent of this location data, Kotaku asked for data from European players who had all filed personal information requests to Niantic under the GDPR, the European digital privacy legislation designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. Niantic sent these players all the data it had on them, which the players then shared with Kotaku.\n\nThe files we received contained detailed information about the lives of these players: the number of calories they likely burned during a given session, the distance they travelled, the promotions they engaged with. Crucially, each request also contained a large file of timestamped location data, as latitudes and longitudes.\n\nIn total, Kotaku analysed more than 25,000 location records voluntarily shared with us by 10 players of Niantic games. On average, we found that Niantic kept about three location records per minute of gameplay of Wizards Unite, nearly twice as many as it did with Pok\u00e9mon Go. For one player, Niantic had at least one location record taken during nearly every hour of the day, suggesting that the game was collecting data and sharing it with Niantic even when the player was not playing.\n\nWhen Kotaku first asked Niantic why Wizards Unite was collecting location data even while the game was not actively being played, its first response was that we must be mistaken, since the game, it said, did not collect data while backgrounded.\n\nAfter we provided Niantic with more information about that player, it got back to us a few days later to let us know that its engineering team \u201cdid identify a bug in the Android version of the client code that led it to continue to ping our servers intermittently when the app was still open but had been backgrounded.\u201d The bug, Niantic said, has now been fixed.\n\nBecause the location data collected by Wizards Unite and sent to Niantic is so granular, sometimes up to 13 location records a minute, it is possible to discern individual patterns of user behaviour as well as intimate details about a player\u2019s life. As an experiment, we approached players with insights we gleaned by combing through five days\u2019 worth of their data, to find out how accurate our inferences were.\n\nIn five days of gameplay, Niantic kept 2304 location records for one player. By looking at the timestamps and frequency with which this user would return to particular areas, we were able to correctly identify their employer and address of residence.\n\nFurthermore, by plotting these data points on a map we could correctly discern the routes the user took from work to home, their daily schedule, and even their eating habits. When we asked them about their propensity to eat Burger King for lunch, they were surprised that we knew that, saying afterwards that they were \u201caddicted to fast food.\u201d\n\nA graph showing the movements of a Harry Potter: Wizards Unite player, using location data collected by Niantic. (Gif: Kotaku)\n\nWhile identifying an individual player\u2019s routines might tell you a lot about their life, oftentimes looking at deviations from that routine can be more revealing. Another player, Laszlo, usually wakes up between 7 and 8am in his house in a tree-lined neighbourhood on the Buda side of Budapest. At around 9:30, he travels to work, always in a vehicle, always passing a Starbucks where he \u201ccould catch at least three creatures every time.\u201d (Niantic says that while Pok\u00e9mon will appear more frequently near Pokestops and Gyms, they do not appear more frequently near sponsored locations.)\n\nHowever, on one particular Monday, Laszlo deviated from his predicted path and visited a pharmacy near a shopping mall. While the rest of his day is unremarkable, in the evening, instead of taking his usual midnight stroll to the soccer fields, Laszlo\u2019s data went dark until the morning.\n\nKotaku asked Laszlo if he had been sick that day. He laughed. \u201cThe pattern is that I usually walk my dogs quite late to that sports complex\u2026 and I have two kids\u2026 so it happens quite often that I have to buy nasal drops from that pharmacy when they get a cold,\u201d he said. In itself, this deviation was not a juicy revelation. However, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Niantic, with all of its location intelligence, doesn\u2019t have records of players travelling to revealing locations that they might not want others to know about.\n\nAfter we reviewed the data, the Burger-King loving player was surprised to find that the game would \u201ccollect so much,\u201d calling the app\u2019s behaviour \u201cscary\u201d and \u201cunexpected.\u201d They were in the habit of leaving the game running in the background, they said, but now that they \u201csaw all the data,\u201d they \u201cclose the game fully more times\u201d during the day.\n\nThis is not the only player who changed their behaviour once they obtained their data from Niantic. One player who lives in Spain told Kotaku that she was surprised by the files Niantic returned to her, and has now become more intentional about where she plays the game.\n\n\u201cI try not to play in my house and other places where I go all the time, because I don\u2019t want them to know my routine and all that,\u201d she told Kotaku, saying she felt deceived by Niantic. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they have to keep all that information \u2026 It\u2019s like they are trying to control us.\u201d\n\n\u201cNiantic\u2019s privacy policy details the data we collect and process in order to provide location-based games to our users,\u201d the company told Kotaku. \u201cA user who is uncomfortable with their report may also request that Niantic delete their data.\u201d\n\nNiantic is far from the only company collecting this sort of data. Last year, the New York Times published an expose on how over 75 companies receive pinpoint-accurate, anonymous location data from phone apps on over 200 million devices. Sometimes, these companies tracked users\u2019 locations over 14,000 times a day. The result was always the same: Even though users had signed away their location data to these companies by agreeing to their user agreements, a lot of the time, they generally had no idea that companies were taking such exhaustive notes on what kind of person they are, where they\u2019d been, where they were likely to go next, and whether they\u2019d buy something there.\n\nThat Niantic is yet another company that can infer this type of mundane personal information may not be, in itself, surprising. Credit card companies, email providers, cellular services, and a variety of data brokers all have access to your personal information in increasingly opaque ways. Remember when Target figured out that a high school girl was pregnant before her family did?\n\nHarry Potter: Wizards Unite players at the game\u2019s inaugural Fan Festival in Indianapolis this past September. (Photo: Niantic)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the personal data that players requested from Niantic and voluntarily shared with Kotaku is, according to Niantic, not something that a third party could buy from them, or otherwise be allowed to see. \u201cNiantic does not share individual player data with third party sponsored location partners,\u201d a representative said, adding that it uses \u201cadditional mechanisms to process the data so that it cannot be connected to an individual.\u201d\n\nNiantic\u2019s Kawai told Kotaku that the anonymised data that Niantic shares with third parties is only in the form of \u201caggregated stats,\u201d such as \u201chow many people have had access or went to those in-game locations and how many actions people take in those in-game locations, how many PokeStop spins to get items happened on that day and\u2026 what unique number of people went to that location.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go any further than that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe idea that data can successfully be anonymised has long been a contentious one. In July, researchers at Imperial College London were able to accurately reidentify 99.98 per cent of Americans in an \u201canonymised\u201d dataset. And in 2018, a New York Times investigation found that, when provided raw anonymised location data, companies could identify individuals with or without their consent. In fact, according to experts, it can take just four timestamped location records to specifically identify an individual from a collection of latitudes and longitudes that they have visited.\n\n\u201c\u2018Anonymous data\u2019 is a contradiction in terms,\u201d said Justin Brookman, a privacy expert at Consumer Reports who formerly worked for the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cI think it\u2019s bad practice if information shared for one narrow purpose \u2014 especially sensitive data like geolocation \u2014 is shared opaquely with third parties,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be law about this to constrain third-party sharing of data beyond what\u2019s reasonably necessary for an app to work. There\u2019s no need for Burger King or Starbucks to know I was catching Charmander in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time an app collects location data, you have to hope the app developer has given some thought to the risks involved, but this is hard to tell from a privacy policy alone,\u201d said Joseph Jerome, a privacy consultant who formerly served as policy counsel for the Privacy & Data Project at the Centre for Democracy & Technology. \u201cA lot of companies will say that IP addresses and other technical information is not personal. Niantic is not making [these claims], which is a good thing.\u201d\n\nNiantic\u2019s current valuation is over $6 billion, technically qualifying it as a \u201cunicorn\u201d startup, higher on the valuation list than CreditKarma or 23andMe.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear in our statements about our desire to create broadly appealing entertainment products that follow our goals of encouraging exploration, exercise, and real-world social interaction as well as our desire to create the Niantic Real World Platform and supporting technologies such as the AR Cloud,\u201d said John Hanke in an email. \u201cI believe investors value us based on those goals.\u201d\n\nNiantic makes a staggering amount of money off in-game microtransactions, a reported $3 billion in Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s first two years. It also makes money from sponsorships.\n\nBy late 2017, there were over 35,000 sponsored PokeStops, which players visited over 500 million times. Hanke described foot traffic as the \u201choly grail of retail businesses\u201d in a 2017 talk to the Mobile World Congress. 13,000 of the sponsored stops were Starbucks locations. Starbucks offered a sickeningly sweet custom Frappuccino if you played Pok\u00e9mon Go while in one of its stores. Sprint put lures in front of their stores to attract more Pok\u00e9mon, and if people walked into a Sprint and inquired about their services, the company\u2019s Trainer Reward Program would offer incentives to retain them.\n\n\u201cWe have always been transparent about this product and feel it is a much better experience for our players than the kind of video and text ads frequently deployed in other mobile games,\u201d Hanke told Kotaku. He then shared a link to an Ad Age article announcing Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s sponsored locations and detailing its \u201ccost per visit\u201d business model.\n\nBig-money tech companies rarely make money in just one or two ways, and often inconspicuously employ money-making strategies that may be less palatable to privacy-minded consumers. Mobile app companies are notorious for this.\n\nOne 2017 Oxford study, for example, analysed 1 million smartphone apps and determined that the median Google Play Store app can share users\u2019 behavioural data with 10 third parties, while one in five can share it with over 20. \u201cFreemium\u201d mobile apps can earn big revenue from sharing data with advertisers \u2014 and it\u2019s all completely opaque to users, as a Buzzfeed News report explained in 2018.\n\nA graph illustrating the number of location records captured for one Harry Potter: Wizards Unite user per minute, over the span of a few hours. (Image: Kotaku)\n\nAdvertising market research company Emarketer projected that advertisers will spend $43 billion on location-targeted advertising, also referred to as \u201cgeoconquesting,\u201d this year. Marketers target and tailor ads for app users in a specific location in real-time, segment a potential audience for an ad by location, learn about consumers based on where they were before they bought something, and connect online ads to offline purchases using location data \u2014 another manifestation of \u201cubiquitous computing.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest location-targeted ad companies, GroundTruth, taps data from 120 million unique monthly users to drive people to businesses like Taco Bell, where it recently took credit for 170,000 visits after a location-targeted ad campaign.\n\nGeoconquesting is now fully integrated into digital mapping, and has been for years. Google Maps offers its location-targeted advertising service, which capitalises on Google\u2019s knowledge of where you typically go in the world and places you seem most interested in based on searches.\n\nFoursquare, once a social app for telling friends what restaurants or museums you\u2019ve been to, is now leveraging its 13 billion check-ins into its new business model: \u201ca location data and technology platform\u201d that pairs \u201clocation tech with other data points, like transaction history.\u201d 150,000 business partners, including Apple and Uber, receive audience profiles and granular location data, which they can tailor into, for example, a curated, personalised itinerary for a hotel guest that also drives foot traffic.\n\nNiantic said it is not in the business of selling user location data. But it will send its users to you. Wizards Unite recently partnered with Simon Malls, which owns over 200 shopping centres, to add \u201cmultiple sponsored Inns and Fortresses\u201d at each location, \u201cgiving players more XP and more spell energy than at any other non-sponsored location in the U.S.\u201d As online shopping overtakes the mall experience, new technology is necessary to attract the sort of foot traffic that could keep malls off life support.\n\nWhat might help is technology offering insights into how people behave at malls, too, so retailers can tweak their strategies for luring in foot traffic and pushing product. If the goal is to unite the physical with the digital, insights gleaned from how long users loiter outside a Coach store and how long they might look at a Coach Instagram ad could be massively useful to these waning mall brands. Uniting these worlds for a field trip around Tokyo is one thing; uniting them to consolidate digital and physical ad profiles is another.\n\n\u201cThis is a hot topic in mall operation \u2014 tracking the motion of people within a mall, what stores they\u2019re going to, how long they\u2019re going,\u201d said Ron Merriman, a theme park business strategist based in Shanghai (who, he noted after we contacted him for this story, happened to go to business school with Hanke). Merriman says that tracking users in malls, aquariums, and theme parks to optimise merchandising, user experiences, and ad targeting is becoming the norm where he lives in Asia. Retailers polled by Emarketer in late 2018 planned on investing more in proximity and location-based marketing than other emerging, hot-topic technologies like AI.\n\n\u201cUntil quite recently, less than the last 10 years, for our business, your connection to your consumer started when they showed up at the front base and ended when they clicked the turnstile on the way out after the fireworks show.\u201d he said. Today, his industry tracks users\u2019 phones, faces, even clothing for the purposes of promoting experiences and products.\n\nThis is not a business that Niantic says it is involved in, but a patent that the company filed in January suggests a possible future for the augmented-shopping experience. It describes something called the \u201ccommercial game feature module,\u201d a technology that lets advertising partners tweak a game\u2019s features in realtime to better incentivise nearby users to visit.\n\nAn app using the tech could get requests from advertisers to do things like \u201clocating virtual elements at specified locations in the virtual world,\u201d or \u201cproviding virtual items and/or enhanced powers to specific players.\u201d It also describes the technology\u2019s ability to \u201ccontinuously monitor the positions of players\u201d and based on this information \u201cidentify players with a predefined radius of commercial activity.\u201d\n\nDetail of a patent, held by Niantic, titled \u201cMethods and systems for generating detailed datasets of an environment via gameplay.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatentable ideas may arise as companies do various types of research and exploration, but they often reflect ideas or technical implementations that do not correspond to product plans, and it can be inaccurate to extrapolate meaning from them,\u201d a Niantic representative said via email in response to Kotaku\u2019s questions about its patents.\n\n\u201cThere is often a big gap between what\u2019s in a [patent] application and what the company is actually doing,\u201d said David Stein, an attorney specialising in technology patents. Stein was a source in a recent Slate piece about how technology companies will often patent ideas they have little intention of actually using.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, he said, that the patents are meaningless. \u201cIf you take a step back, you can figure out generally what they are researching, and generally what sorts of things they are interested in doing,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies generally don\u2019t throw away money on things they have no intention to use.\u201d\n\nWith those caveats in mind, let\u2019s consider some of Niantic\u2019s other recent research. A patent issued in August of this year describes a technology meant to incentivise the collection of data through gameplay.\n\nAn example: \u201c...a computing device is programmed to ask questions to users to cause or incentivise data to be collected for a map of an entire environment (e.g., home), and provide feedback in the form of points for gameplay on the interface of the computing device. Gamification provides a motivation to participate, through in-game rewards and other feedback, such as encouragement (e.g., indications of \u2018great job!\u2019).\u201d\n\nWhen asked about this patent, Kei Kawai said that Niantic\u2019s engineering team researches a lot of ways to use what he called \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to help \u201cusers\u2019 phones or devices understand their situations or where they are better, and reiterated that Niantic\u2019s plans are aimed at \u201cwhat\u2019s fun and makes sense and fits our goal of getting people outside.\u201d\n\nWhile Kawai stresses that Niantic\u2019s goal is always to get people outside, it\u2019s worth noting that these patents specifically refer to mapping floor plans, home offices, kitchens and even the items that you own.\n\nAnother patent held by Niantic, which it acquired when it bought a company called Tick Tock AI in 2018, describes software that can use computer vision to \u201cidentify shoes, determine specific model, determine that shoes belong to John Smith, and disambiguating between other shoes owned and worn by John Smith.\u201d\n\nAccording to this patent, a host of intimate contextual information can then be associated with the item by using \u201c...audio (e.g., noises of cooking), images of the food prior to cooking, activity recognition data of a person cooking, a time at which cooking was initiated and a time at which cooking was completed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not infer or attempt to infer the floor plan of a player\u2019s house or other interior space in any of Niantic\u2019s products,\u201d said a Niantic representative when asked about this patent.\n\nWhether Niantic does it or not, this is one likely future of mapping for augmented reality. In a series of Medium posts, Ryan Hickman, the co-founder of TickTock AI, argued that complex systems like self-driving cars or truly seamless augmented reality experiences require a level of situational awareness and spatial reasoning that AI is currently missing.\n\n\u201cThese virtual characters that are supposed to be the future of our digital lives still have zero understanding of the world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey rely on imperfect mobile sensors that struggle with \u2018optically uncooperative surfaces.\u2019\u201d To Hickman, this is a mapping problem, and one that tech companies are eager to solve with your camera data.\n\nHow does this work? If a company wants to create an AR product where you can yell commands at your virtual pet that are picked up by some ubiquitous computing hardware \u2014 \u201cMaggie, go lie down on my bed!\u201d \u2014 their software needs to know what a \u201cbed\u201d is. It needs to know where in your house the bed is located, and which bed is yours. The software needs to learn, based on images from hundreds of thousands of other people\u2019s unmade beds, how to associate the label \u201cbed\u201d with the collection of pixels that comprise your bed, as seen through your camera.\n\nPhoto: Kin Cheung, AP\n\nIn this computational future, all of this detail comes collectively from us, and relies on turning over a great deal of information to companies with business interests that are often at odds with our own.\n\nAs one former Niantic employee put it: \u201cIt is almost irrelevant to talk about the company\u2019s original intent, because I think that to create such an organisation is to invite rot over time. It\u2019s more of a question of, how can we structure companies that have fiscal responsibility to public welfare?\u201d\n\nIn a future that continues to blur the barriers separating the physical world and the digital one \u2014 one mediated heavily by companies with commercial incentives \u2014 advertisers may glean new and secret wormholes into users\u2019 lives and pocketbooks. Yes, it\u2019s possible that companies with unfathomable financial incentives to capitalise on their data goldmines will remain responsible with users\u2019 privacy, proving that, all along, the point of all this digital mapping momentum was pocket monsters and magic wands and getting gamers outside.\n\nBut what happens over the years as these companies\u2019 executives, shareholders, goals, and priorities change and grow, and the data set they hold on to just gets more and more detailed?\n\nToday, Niantic can believably cast itself as a company aimed at getting gamers outside. But John Hanke sometimes describes it as an advertising company or a digital mapping company, too. The open question of where this market-leading technology goes from here \u2014 whether it\u2019s smiling pocket pets more believably hopping around our bedrooms, or the Hyper-Reality of ubiquitous computing, saturated with data-probes and targeted advertising \u2014 is what may make space for the rot to set in.\n\nWhat is surprising about Niantic is not what it\u2019s doing, but what it\u2019s capable of, and the fact that most of its users won\u2019t ever understand just how much they\u2019re handing over whenever they use a location-based app.\n\n\u201cWe live in a technological surveillance capitalism state,\u201d said the former employee. \u201cHow could it be any other way?\u201d", "description": "Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, the latest game from the company behind Pok\u00e9mon Go, lets players harness the magic of their childhood to combat monsters and collect shimmering digital artefacts across their local neighbourhoods. Niantic\u2019s apps certainly encourage gamers to get outdoors and get active, but behind the...", "authors": ["Cecilia D'Anastasio", "Dhruv Mehrotra", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-17-at-7.44.13-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
