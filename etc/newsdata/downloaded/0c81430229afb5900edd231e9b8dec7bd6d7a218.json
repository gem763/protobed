Perhaps the Archbishop didn\u2019t know, and didn\u2019t want to affirm and later be called out for it.\n\nPentin said the Ford Foundation\u2019s grants database shows that CIMI received significant funding from 2010 to 2015. It\u2019s true. Here\u2019s a screenshot I took:\n\nAccording to the Ford site, those grants each year went to:\n\nFor capacity building, networking, mobilization and public education to protect and defend the rights of indigenous communities affected by large infrastructure projects in the Amazon\n\nSo, nothing to do with abortion or gender ideology. Still, the Ford Foundation is not the kind of philanthropy the Catholic Church should be doing business with. The Ford Foundation, as Pentin said in his question, supports abortion rights. Here\u2019s a screenshot from a Foundation post advocating abortion, and written by its \u201cgender, racial, and ethnic justice\u201d program officer:\n\nThis year, according to the Ford Foundation\u2019s own numbers, it has donated just over $5 million to projects supporting \u201creproductive justice\u201d. It has donated $1.6 million this year to programs in the US and overseas promoting LGBT causes.\n\nThe Ford Foundation\u2019s president is Darren Walker, who oversees what the Foundation describes as \u201can international social justice philanthropy with a $13 billion endowment and $600 million in annual grant making.\u201d That\u2019s huge. Walker is also a board member of the Arcus Foundation, which, according to Catholic News Agency:\n\nSince CNA\u2019s February 2015 report on a multi-million dollar campaign against religious freedom protections, the Arcus Foundation has given an additional $2.8 million in grants earmarked for projects aimed at restricting legal protections for religious freedom, especially religious and conscience exemptions in state and federal law. Among its recent donations is an ACLU grant designed to \u201cbeat back\u201d laws protecting freedom of religion and freedom of conscience. In fact, a CNA examination of grant listings and other documents has shown that the Arcus Foundation has funded a variety of coordinated projects, focused on limiting religious freedom, redefining religious liberty, and perhaps even shaping religious doctrine itself.\n\nThat 2015 report, by the way, revealed that the Ford Foundation has given at least $800,000 to fight against religious liberty protections. (Ford stopped giving LGBT-related grants in 2016, on the grounds that that LGBT rights activism was well funded, and its money could be better spent elsewhere.)\n\nIn 2016, Larissa MacFarquhar did a long piece in The New Yorker about the Ford Foundation and Darren Walker. It\u2019s a really interesting piece, talking about how philanthropy at the highest stage works. Walker, a gay black man born into south Louisiana poverty, is a truly fascinating figure. If you don\u2019t know much about the Ford Foundation, you really should read the piece. It has been a \u201csocial justice\u201d foundation from the word go. It was started by big stock donations from the Ford Motor Company family. The NYer piece quotes an early 1970s interview with Henry Ford II, talking about how one of his greatest regrets in life was losing control of the family foundation, which subsequently went far to the political and social left. The Rockefeller Foundation and the Gates Foundation are development foundations, but Ford puts all its money into so-called \u201csocial justice\u201d causes.\n\nIt should not be surprising that the interests of the Ford Foundation and the interests of the Catholic Church intersect at some points. In principle, I see no obvious conflict between the Catholic Church in Brazil\u2019s desire to protect indigenous Amazon peoples, and the Ford Foundation\u2019s desire to do the same thing. Does that make it okay for the Catholic Church to take the Ford Foundation\u2019s money?\n\nChurches \u2014 Catholic and otherwise \u2014 take money from donors who are not always saints. The Bolsheviks destroyed many Orthodox churches in Russia, which are being rebuilt in some cases with donations from Russian oligarchs. Many of the treasured religious buildings of Europe were constructed with money from Catholic and Protestant oligarchs of their own day.\n\nMy spidey sense pricks up too when I see the Ford Foundation\u2019s involvement in anything to do with the Christian church, given how much Ford opposes anything to do with orthodox Christianity. The Ford Foundation, from an orthodox Christian perspective, is bad news. They are Social Justice Warriors with $600 million to donate each year. Edward Pentin\u2019s question was justified.\n\nBut if we\u2019re going to talk about whether or not a church can take the devil\u2019s money to do God\u2019s work \u2014 and that is an important conversation to have! \u2014 well, that\u2019s a conversation that goes far beyond Ford and the Amazon.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-17-at-12.13.09-PM-e1571332416422.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
