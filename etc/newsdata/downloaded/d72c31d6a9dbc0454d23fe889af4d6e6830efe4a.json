Thirty-nine people, 31 men and eight women, one of whom was a teenager, were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nA 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the deaths, according to Essex police. The suspect has been named by British media, but this has not yet been confirmed yet by Essex Police who said they would not \"speculate\" about the identity of the suspect.\n\nPolice in Northern Ireland are supporting the investigation and have raided three houses in connection with the incident, Essex police said. The trailer has been removed from from the industrial park as the authorities prepare for a coroner's post-mortem examination. Each of the 39 individuals found dead must undergo a full post-mortem in order to establish cause of death before they can be identified, in a process police described as \"complex and lengthy.\"\n\nThe U.K. Home Office, the government department responsible for domestic security and immigration, will also be working with Essex police and the National Crime Agency (NCA) on the investigation, the largest the country has seen since the 7/7 bombings. The NCA said they are working to \u201cidentify and take action against any organized crime groups who have played a role in causing these deaths.\u201d\n\nThe trailer entered the U.K. from the Belgian coastal town of Zeebrugge into the port of Purfleet, arriving at around 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, police said. The tractor unit traveled from Dublin, Ireland to Purfleet, where it collected the trailer. The tractor and trailer unit then left the port at around 12:30 a.m. on October 23, before arriving at the industrial park in Grays, where the vehicle was discovered by emergency services shortly after.\n\nHannah Mckay/Reuters\n\nThe Belgian Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office has opened a case into the incident and are working in \u201cclose cooperation\u201d with British police.\n\n\u201cThe investigation will focus on the organizers of and all other parties involved in this transport,\u201d the Prosecutor\u2019s Office said in a statement. \u201cIt is not yet clear when the victims were placed in the container and whether this happened in Belgium.\u201d\n\nThe Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying the Scania brand truck was registered in Bulgaria on behalf of a company owned by an Irish citizen.\n\nRichard Burnett, the Chief Executive of the Road Haulage Association, the trade body responsible for the needs of U.K. road transport operators, said the \u201ctragedy \u2026 highlights the danger of migrant gangs people-smuggling on lorries.\u201d\n\nBurnett told the BBC that the trailer may have been refrigerated, meaning temperatures could have reached as low as -13 F. Traffickers were increasingly using smaller ports as points of entry to the U.K., he said, as the security operations at larger ports such as the French port of Calais is more \u201crobust.\u201d\n\nSteve Valdez-Symonds, the Refugee and Migrants Director of Amnesty International U.K., described the deaths as \u201cheartbreaking and horrifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who are forced to take dangerous and sometimes fatal passages to reach the U.K. often do so because current immigration policies and practices deny them safe and legal options,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs the police investigation continues our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those affected by this awful tragedy.\u201d\n\nIt is the largest incident of this kind in the U.K. since 58 bodies were found in a truck at the English port of Dover in the year 2000.", "description": "The 39 found dead in a semi truck in Essex, England, are believed to be Chinese nationals, as new details emerge around the shocking incident.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/BRITAIN-BODIES-HAWORTH-DAVIES_hpMain_20191024-070502_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
