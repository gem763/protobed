One cannot stand, nor even exist, without the other. Thus the boat is not a mere addition, but rather a fundamental element both intellectually and technically.\u201d\n\nThe developer estimates that construction will begin in 2021 and take less than three years to complete.\n\n(Image: Credit: Trigema via Pen News)\n\nA promotional video for the scheme links the design to global warming and envisions the tower in a post-apocalyptic landscape, surrounded only by water.\n\nThen, in the clip, the flood waters recede and reveal the surrounding city. It\u2019s a design that\u2019s elicited a mixed reaction.\n\nCzech architect Michal Postr\u00e1neck\u00fd told Prague\u2019s Lidov\u00e9 noviny newspaper that a \u201cmore realistic\u201d design should be picked.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom an urban perspective, I think a high-rise building could be there, but the chosen concept is not a happy one \u2013 it adds no value.\u201d\n\nUrban planner Ivan Kaplan of the Czech Technical University expressed reservations about the height of the building.\n\n(Image: Credit: Trigema via Pen News)\n\n\u201cConcerns about the climate catastrophe can be expressed differently, more subtly and more cheaply,\u201d he said.\n\nArchitect V\u00edt M\u00e1slo, however, wished the developers success.\n\n\u201cHopefully the building will succeed because there is a great deal of resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for David \u010cern\u00fd's design, the shipwreck is such a transfer of sculpture to architecture, it can be interesting, yet difficult to implement.\n\n\u201cSculpture and architecture are different concepts, but in an exceptional case \u2013 why not?\u201d\n\nThe building is planned for Prague\u2019s 13th district, close to the Nov\u00e9 Butovice metro station. Its developers say it will not be visible from the historic city centre and would not disturb the skyline there.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nMarcel Soural of Trigema said: \u201cWe have been preparing the Top Tower project for more than two years and the final version was preceded by eight other alternative solutions.\n\n\u201cDuring this time, we have collected and are still collecting suggestions from experts, state and local authorities, and of course the local public, whose representatives have already held and will continue to hold a number of participatory meetings.\u201d\n\nThe main structure will provide rental housing, while the lower floors will host offices and a multi-functional cultural center, connected with a publicly accessible roof garden. On the ground level will be space for shops.\n\nIt\u2019s envisioned as an energy-efficient building, accredited with a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold certificate.\n\nIf it goes ahead, it will be the tallest building in Czechia, overtaking Brno\u2019s AZ Tower.", "description": "Bizarre new plans from Czech development company Trigema would see the 450ft structure towering over the historic city", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Credit", "Trigema Via Pen News", "Trigema Cover Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550322.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-PNSKYSHIP02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
