Their politicians are corrupt. Their candidates are terrible,\u201d Mr. Trump said to huge applause. \u201cAnd they know they can\u2019t win on Election Day so they\u2019re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional bullshit impeachment.\u201d", "description": "The president denounced the impeachment inquiry and condemned what he called the \u201cunholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake news media.\u201d", "authors": ["Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/us/politics/11dc-trump2/merlin_162557967_42d088bf-fbd3-4e72-9de0-8e7d29c1d981-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
