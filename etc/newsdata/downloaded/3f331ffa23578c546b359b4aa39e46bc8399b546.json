Yields across the curve climbed, while the sell-off also spilled into Treasuries and European debt.\n\nBehind the sudden collapse lies the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to potentially slash bond purchases in October, and an announcement that the Government Pension Investment Fund is pivoting toward buying more foreign debt. All of a sudden, investors were left wondering what other changes were in store.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ\u2019s operation change had a huge psychological impact,\u201d said Eiji Dohke, chief bond strategist at SBI Securities in Tokyo. \u201cInvestors are reluctant to buy given the risk of the BOJ skipping a purchase.\u201d\n\nFutures of 10-year notes slid as much as 0.97 yen to 154.05. The auction of 10-year debt drew a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.42, the lowest since 2016, with the cut-off price of 102.33 falling short of the 102.64 estimated by traders.\n\nJapanese sovereign bonds were already reeling from September, when they lost 1.1%, the first monthly decline since April, according to a Bloomberg Barclays (LON: ) index.\n\nThe BOJ on Monday slashed purchase ranges for four major maturities, and indicated it may even stop buying debt of more than 25 years. It also suggested that it could skip buying operations as needed as it sought to steepen the yield curve.\n\nYields on Japan\u2019s 10-year cash bond rose 6 basis points to minus 0.15%. They also climbed 7 basis points for Treasuries with a comparable maturity, while U.K. gilt yields rose 6 basis points.\n\nWhile investors are waiting for the central bank\u2019s first bond purchase operation for this month on Friday, they also have to assess the long-term implications from GPIF\u2019s announcement Tuesday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest pension fund said it will consider currency-hedged overseas bond holdings as similar to domestic debt investments. That will allow GPIF to buy more foreign debt, as it\u2019s already close to the 19% limit in its current mandate.\n\nTakahiro Sekido, a strategist at MUFG Bank Ltd., estimated GPIF may allocate more than 30% of its existing JGB holdings to currency hedged-foreign bonds.\n\n\u201cThere could be many funds following GPIF\u2019s allocation change,\u201d said Sekido, a former BOJ official. \u201cJapanese bonds have reached the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to buy.\u201d", "description": "Japan\u2019s Worst Bond Auction in Years Spurs Global Sell-Off", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice207446f2d57b35c5bb0168a0d51d73c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
