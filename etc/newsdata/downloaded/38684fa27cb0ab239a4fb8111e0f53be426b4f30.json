(Joshua Lott/Reuters)\n\nPeople give in to the temptation to manufacture reasons to be pitied, and the buyers can\u2019t resist the pitch because it comes with the opportunity to hate included.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The following is Jonah Goldberg\u2019s weekly \u201cnews\u201dletter, the G-File. Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (Including those of you merely pretending to be readers as part of some elaborate ruse to get more attention),\n\nHere\u2019s something you might not know: In Nazi Germany, very few Jews staged bogus hate crimes against themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s some more trivia: Very few blacks in the Jim Crow South went to great lengths to pretend that they were harassed or attacked by racists.\n\nYou know why? Because that would be incredibly stupid. What, exactly, would the German Jew who staged an assault on himself gain from it? Where would he or she go to ask for sympathy or recompense? Conjure any horror story you like, the Nazi official you brought it to would say, \u201cYeah, and . . . ?\u201d The black sharecropper who took the time to make his own cross and burn it on his own property would benefit . . . how?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy am I bringing this up? Well, for a bunch of reasons. I have more points to make than can be found at an English Setter competition.\n\nFirst, people who live under real oppression have no need to fabulate oppression. To paraphrase Madge from the old Palmolive ads: They\u2019re already soaking in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, when you live in an oppressive country, there\u2019s no one you can take your grievances to because that is what it means to live in an oppressive country! For God\u2019s sake, people, you\u2019re making me use exclamation points and italics here. If you\u2019re an inmate in the Shawshank prison, you can\u2019t go to the guards to complain. When you live in North Korea, you can\u2019t go to the local police and gripe about your working conditions or the sawdust in your bread.\n\nI feel like one of the Duke Brothers explaining how you might find bacon in a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich. But in oppressive societies, the oppression isn\u2019t a bug \u2014 it\u2019s a feature. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called \u201coppressive.\u201d Complaining about oppression in such societies is like a fish complaining that there are a lot of fish in a barrel of fish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a Free Society Means\n\nWhich brings me to the third point: In non-oppressive countries, there are people to take your case to. Sohrab Ahmari put it nicely in an essay a couple of years ago:\n\nAnd as Pascal Bruckner wrote in his essay \u201cThe Tyranny of Guilt,\u201d if liberal democracy does trap or jail you (politically speaking), it also invariably slips the key under your cell door. The Swedish midwives driven out of the profession over their pro-life views can take their story to the media. The Down syndrome advocacy outfit whose anti-eugenic advertising was censored in France can sue in national and then international courts. The Little Sisters of the Poor can appeal to the Supreme Court for a conscience exemption to Obamacare\u2019s contraceptives mandate. And so on.\n\nThis is a hugely important point, and there\u2019s an urgent need for more people to understand it. A free society is a rich ecosystem of competing institutions. Some are powerful, some weak. Some have great influence in a specific sphere of life: the American Bar Association, the military, the Catholic Church, whatever. Some only have power in a certain place: the county zoning board, the local police, your parents, etc. But none have unchecked power over the whole of the society and, thanks to the Constitution, that goes for the government itself, too.\n\nA free society is a honeycomb of safe havens, competing authorities \u2014 legal, moral, cultural \u2014 that allow for people to find safe harbors from other institutions (\u201cAnd, apparently, a safe harbor from mixed metaphors\u201d \u2014 The Couch). The pursuit of happiness is an individual right that can only be achieved communally with the communities the individual chooses to be part of.\n\nBut, as I\u2019ve been writing a lot lately, when statists, planners, nationalists, socialists, et al. embrace the language of crisis or war \u2014 metaphorical or otherwise \u2014 they are trying to board up these safe havens, to close off avenues of dissent or simple apathy about a given cause. Culture warriors demand that you care. They demand that you be part of the solution, and if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re part of the problem. When this spirit takes over, there\u2019s no one to appeal to for your grievance, because everyone is in on the new crusade or too afraid to say they\u2019re not. Oppressive societies are societies where you don\u2019t have the right to exit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA host of liberals are bleating about conservative \u201cgloating\u201d over the Smollett debunking. What they seem to sincerely not understand is that their instant acceptance of the story and their instant condemnation of anyone who voiced skepticism over it was an act of oppression. \u201cYou must care!\u201d \u201cYou must believe!\u201d There is no safe harbor. No right to skepticism or even reflection. He is our Horst Wessel, and you must grasp your complicity in evil. That this response came from Hollywood types who make a living off giving free rein to their emotions is not shocking. That mainstream journalists did it wasn\u2019t shocking either, but it was appalling. It was appalling because they really can\u2019t see how invested they are in this kind of narrative peddling, how convinced they are that they see the world as it is, and the people who disagree are not just fools, but evil.\n\nAnd now that the truth is out, they are flummoxed, and this consternation is appalling, too.\n\nFrom Kyle Smith\u2019s piece about the widespread shock in the media that Smollett\u2019s story was a fraud:\n\nAna Cabrera, CNN anchor, was equally flummoxed Saturday night: \u201cThe big question, then, is why?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy he would make something like this up?\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s senior entertainment reporter Lisa France was comparably engulfed by confusion. \u201cIf he actually did this, why in the world would he do this?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy? That\u2019s what everyone wants to know.\u201d\n\nA bit later, Stelter chimed in again: \u201cThis is about why he might \u2014 and, so far, we don\u2019t know. But why he might have made this up. It just boggles the mind.\u201d\n\nIf you think it\u2019s mind-boggling, then you\u2019re part of the problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Smallness of Jussie Smollett\n\nThe Jussie Smollett story is not mind-boggling, it\u2019s not even mind-yahtzeeing. It\u2019s normal in these abnormal times.\n\nI\u2019ve been exhausted with the Smollett case since the story of his brave search for a Subway sandwich deep in the heart of MAGA country first made headlines. Like most conservatives I know, I greeted the story skeptically from the outset. The idea that the upscale streets of Streeterville are like a modern Mogadishu with roving bands of MAGA hat-wearing, Empire-watching, bleach-and-noose carrying hooligans just waiting to pounce on gay black dudes in the wee hours of the morning on literally one of the coldest Chicago nights in decades struck me as implausible.\n\nMAGA Thug: \u201cI know it\u2019s cold. But just wait. We know those gay black guys need to eat, and they can\u2019t resist the gray translucent turkey product at Subway . . . Wait! There he is! Grab the bleach!\u201d\n\nBut I just couldn\u2019t muster the energy to follow every detail, which is why I\u2019m grateful to our Kyle Smith for all his due diligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sound superior. I wish I\u2019d called bulls*** on the story the way Kyle did from the get-go (and the way I did on the UVA rape story). But I\u2019ve been trying not to join Twitter mobs, even when I suspect the mob is right. That\u2019s the danger of trying to follow a policy of not rushing to judgment; you sometimes end up forgoing the satisfaction of saying, \u201cI told you so!\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason I was reluctant: Smollett\u2019s hoax isn\u2019t that unusual. I\u2019m already running long, so I\u2019ll spare you the data, but hoaxes happen all the time \u2014 and so do actual hate crimes. They\u2019ve happened under Trump , and they were happening for decades before Trump. That\u2019s why it\u2019s particularly galling to see Al Sharpton opine on the Smollett case given that his entire career stemmed from the Tawana Brawley hoax and his role in a real hate crime that killed seven people .\n\nI\u2019ve been following this stuff ever since I witnessed such hoaxes as a college student. I think the first book I ever reviewed professionally was about student activism. The author, Paul Rogat Loeb, had a whole chapter about racism on college campuses. He focused on a hate crime at Emory. It was only after dozens of pages about all the wonderful consciousness-raising \u2014 and shakedowns of administrators \u2014 that resulted from the response to the atrocity that he acknowledged that the victim orchestrated the whole thing. But that was irrelevant, according to Loeb, because \u201cother racial harassment has unquestionably occurred again and again, at colleges nationwide.\u201d And besides, so much consciousness was raised! I wrote at the time, \u201cWhen students are taught that the coin of the realm is race and rage, invariably some will spend that currency on self-aggrandizement and controversy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that gets me to my next point.\n\nWe\u2019re Asking For It\n\nA truism of economics is that you get more of what you subsidize and less of what you tax. I have no quarrel with that. But it seems to me we don\u2019t think enough about how this principle applies to areas we see as outside of economics.\n\nFor instance, contrary to what one hears in the left-wing punditsphere, there\u2019s a high cultural penalty \u2014 a tax, if you will \u2014 on open racism, which is one reason there is so much less of it today. Already, I can hear throats clearing to say \u201cOh yeah, what price has Donald Trump paid!!!?!?!\u201d Well, leaving aside the merits of the cases for and against the claim that Donald Trump is a racist, it\u2019s transparently obvious that he\u2019s paid a political price for the perception that he is one. The reflexive opposition to Trump by many of the media outlets from which he craves approval is driven in no small part by the widespread liberal assumption that he\u2019s a bigot of one kind or another. Similarly, he\u2019s almost surely paid a price among many independent and moderate voters, including the millions who voted for both Trump and Obama, because of how he\u2019s perceived, fairly or not.\n\nBut my point here isn\u2019t to talk about Trump, but to check the box so I don\u2019t have to talk about him further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn our culture, as with any culture, we reward certain behaviors and penalize others. Think of the young women who made sex tapes as a stepping stone to celebrity. In a different culture, this would not be a wise career strategy. But in our current click-baity climate (which has been this way since long before we had the term clickbait), controversy, attention, etc. are their own reward. Positive attention may be better than negative attention, but negative attention is superior to no attention at all (an insight exploited to great extent by an increasing number of politicians).\n\nWell, slattern chic is just one shining facet of the disco ball of asininity that our culture has become.\n\nThe sort of racism Smollett manufactured has never been lower in the United States, but rather than celebrate or express gratitude for this incontestable fact, people look for proof it\u2019s worse than ever. Bereft of giants to slay, they construct windmills and pretend they are heroes for levelling their lances at them. Like the elders of Salem, they mistake their quiet hysteria for sober reality and believe every tale of witches beyond the tree line. On the principle that some things have to be believed to be seen, wearing a blanket at Oberlin is all the proof one needs for a moral panic over the invading armies of the Klan , just as the splash of a dolphin\u2019s tale was proof of mermaids for horny sailors centuries ago.\n\nThis, too, is just a facet of the larger tapestry, just one rhinestone glistening off a Liberace cape of self-indulgence.\n\nH. Auden\u2019s prophetic poem \u201cFor the Time Being,\u201d keeps coming to mind. Auden predicted that in the \u201cNew Age\u201d:\n\nKnowledge will degenerate into a riot of subjective visions & Justice will be replaced by Pity as the cardinal human virtue, and all fear of retribution will vanish & The New Aristocracy will consist exclusively of hermits, bums and permanent invalids. The Rough Diamond, the Consumptive Whore, the bandit who is good to his mother, the epileptic girl who has a way with animals will be the heroes and heroines of the New Age, when the general, the statesman, and the philosopher have become the butt of every farce and satire.\n\nNot all of his examples fit, but he was onto something. If there was a commodities market for pity when Auden was writing, he would have been wise to take a large position because the pity bubble has been expanding for decades now. The New Aristocracy also includes both women with biological penises and those who want to abort their babies in the delivery room \u2014 but not the babies themselves. Gay men who travel cross country to buy cakes from pious bakers are heroes and even old Jewish socialists are villains for the crime of Having a Penis While White (and not thinking that should disqualify them to be president).\n\nBut pity is a soft emotion that needs something hard to brace against. And that\u2019s why hate belongs in every bullish portfolio, too. We prove our virtue by pitying the right victims and hating the right victimizers. And in any booming market, the incentives for counterfeiting skyrocket. And so people give in to the temptation to manufacture reasons to be pitied, and the buyers can\u2019t resist the pitch because it comes with the opportunity to hate included.\n\nHoaxes and hysteria-fueled misinterpretations are common on the left because a certain kind of pity and hate has become institutionalized, monetized, and sacralized. But while pity and hate take a certain recognizable, custom-made form on the left \u2014 call it bespoke woke \u2014 the left doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on the larger phenomenon. Donald Trump demands pity almost daily, and he gets it. And the pitiers get their opportunities for hatred, too. Christopher Hasson is an exceptional case, but only because he took the rhetoric of pity and hate duopoly to an extreme conclusion.\n\nBut the rhetoric itself is all over the place \u2014 and it\u2019s getting worse . The amount of self-pity on the right is staggering, and it produces an enormous amount of hatred \u2014 not so much racist hate, as various liberal elites would have us believe, but hatred at the liberals because they believe it. We\u2019re victims because they hate us, so we must hate them. Pity and hate, hate and pity, for as far as the eye can see, like a snake eating itself.\n\nSo I\u2019ll leave with this depressing prediction. Obviously more Smollett-style hoaxes are coming. If the negative attention heaped on mass shooters is enough to inspire other losers to commit that kind of evil, it\u2019s easy to imagine that the attention Smollett has gotten will inspire losers to do likewise. But that\u2019s not my prediction. There will be a hoax involving MAGA hats, but the fake victims will be those wearing them. We already saw the hunger for this kind of thing in the Covington case \u2014 but those kids were in fact victims. President Trump invited that kid named Trump to the State of the Union precisely because he wanted to exploit this great reservoir of pity. And the coverage of this legitimate outrage will no doubt encourage others to get a piece of that on the cheap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo mark my words, some loser, desperate to be lionized by Candace Owens or applauded at CPAC, will manufacture some story of victimhood that will ignite a bonfire of outrage on the right and a riot of sympathy about MAGA persecution. The mainstream media will suddenly remember the professional integrity it forgot in the Smollett case and debunk it. But before then, the pitiables of the right will claim victimhood by proxy and denounce the insensitivity of an uncaring media that hates them. The roles will be reversed, but the script will be the same, and the actors will all yell just a little bit louder, as the snake ups the tempo of its own repast.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nCanine Update: So Pippa has been extra spanielly this last week or so. The cold weather , the mud , the snow , the ice, and in particular, the combination of all four have brought out the true essence of Pippa and provided the content people seem to crave. This video has over 123K views. And this one has been viewed 141 thousand times (though I suspect a lot of that is from repeat viewers). The problem is that when Pippa is truly joyous, the constraints of civilized society vanish, and because she is truly joyous when she gets in muddy water, that behavior also leads her to do very bad things, like roll in fetid foulness. Worse, all of these things lead to baths, which in turn make her all the more desperate to erase the bourgeois scents of modern society, making these cycles repeat themselves.\n\nBut that\u2019s my problem. Both girls are having a really good time these days. They were a little too needy when the Fair Jessica was out of town . Zo\u00eb is even willing to be captured in action on video . Here she is with her bestest friend Sammie. People keep asking me about the cameos from other dogs that Zo\u00eb and Pippa know. Sammie is Zo\u00eb\u2019s buddy from her midday pack. They have a very close and special relationship . They\u2019ve been playing like this since they were puppies. And it\u2019s always great when they get reunited . But fear not, Zo\u00eb still makes time for Pip.\n\nI hope that continues, but we\u2019ve decided that Zo\u00eb needs to go on even more of diet, which is hard because we only really feed her once a day as it is, and it\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t get a lot of exercise. If anybody has any good advice, please send it my way.\n\nIn other news, I can\u2019t begin to tell you how stunned and flattered I was when I heard the news that my appearance on EconTalk was selected as the audience favorite for 2018. I consider Econtalk the gold standard in egghead podcasts. I learned so much from it, I mentioned it in the acknowledgements of my book. So it was particularly awesome that my talk about the book beat out some really amazing competition.
