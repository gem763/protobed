There were 17 people on the phone, including the Secretary of State, so the president was so open, and shall I say transparent, about it that that goes to his intent. There was no corrupt bargain, or attempt to achieve a corrupt bargain.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the situation with Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner, Starr said that while the president may have been imprudent in bringing up Joe Biden, \u201ca potential opponent,\u201d Trump\u2019s concern was \u201cinformation about election past, not election future.\u201d\n\nStarr said that the much-discussed Ukrainian military aid, which was part of a \u201cquid-pro-quo\u201d with the Ukrainians for investigating Hunter Biden, was delivered by its legally-required end of the fiscal year, making the case even more speculative.\n\n\u201cEven assuming that is was \u2018being withheld in this kind of corrupt arraignment,\u2019 it was issued in good order, it was not, in fact, held up, and then you move to, I think, a genuine squabble over the timeline, interpretations over the timeline \u2014 this is so far from a cold, on the docks, Richard Nixon-engaged-in [case], and everyone accepted it, in a conspiracy to obstruct justice,\u201d he said.\u201d\n\nStarr pushed back on the use of impeachment as a political weapon, and instead argued that it would be \u201cwithin the bounds of reason\u201d for Democrats to attempt to censure Trump for mentioning Biden on the call, in the same way the House Republicans recently attempted to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.)\n\n\u201cWe need to ratchet down the conversation because of the evils of impeachment,\u201d Starr stated. \u201cImpeachment has become a terrible, terrible thorn in the side of the American democracy and the conduct of American government since Watergate. We need to get rid of this \u2018let\u2019s go to impeachment immediately,\u2019 let\u2019s at least have a reasoned and deliberate conversation about some lesser kind of response.\u201d\n\nStarr closed by suggesting the current impeachment tactics by House Democrats have not been pursued in good faith.\n\n\u201cRight now, the Democrats have embarked on quite an unusual and unorthodox process. Time will tell, but fundamental norms of fairness are not being observed at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce this sinks in to the public conscience, as it\u2019s bound to do, because the procedures are so unorthodox, so unusual, such a substantial departure from history that the American people will eventually understand that, and that they will either care about it, as I think they will, or they will brush it off and say \u2018well, they should not have done this, but they did.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Former U.S. Solicitor General Ken Starr, who headed the impeachment efforts against President Clinton, said on a podcast Monday that the impeachment frenzy surrounding President Trump stems from \u201ccreative\u201d efforts and holds Trump \u201cto a remarkable standard.\u201d\u201cHe did nothing that sounds in the nature of", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7UqfzDV4KJWEcKS0zpvuhA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/8a01332c0b94e8ae46988cedb6c2083c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
