Amazon\n\nBedding can be a pricey investment, and why shouldn't it be? If you're spending every night on the same set of sheets and under the same comforter, you should hope that these pieces are soft, comfortable, and long-lasting. You might be willing to pay a premium for them, but before you start taking out your checkbook, it's also worth giving some more affordable options a chance.\n\nI recently tried one such option, a best-selling alternative down comforter from Equinox. At first glance, the biggest draw is clearly its price: the queen size costs $29 and the king $43. And there's a twin size for $27.\n\nThe problem with a cheap price is that it often means the product itself is cheap. After one month of testing, I was glad to see the Equinox comforter did not fall into this category. It's one of those rare unicorn products that are a steal for their quality and, as many reviewers note, an item that rivals the $200-plus competitors they've tried.\n\nEquinox\n\nThe down alternative comforter is made with a siliconized-fiber filling, which prevents dust accumulation and is resistant to bacteria, making it the optimal choice for people who are sensitive to allergens.\n\nThis filling also helps retain heat without making the comforter stifling or overbearingly heavy. I appreciate a weighty feel, especially during the winter, but breathability is still important. I never woke up sweaty with this comforter, which strikes just the right balance of plush fluffiness and weighty warmth.\n\nThe style and softness of the comforter means you can sleep with it as is. The exterior is made with a soft and smooth brushed microfiber, and has a classic quilt-like stitching.\n\nBut it also has corner tabs if you prefer to put a duvet cover over it (for part of the testing period, I used Casper's, which I reviewed in full here). The tabs were quick to tie and did their job in keeping the comforter from shifting around.\n\nMore than 2,100 reviewers agree that the comforter is a five-star purchase for the comfort and warmth it delivers at a very affordable price. While it would probably be too warm for the summer, I think that it can certainly be your essential piece of bedding during the rest of the year. For under $35 for the queen size and under $50 for the king size, you'll get more than enough use out of it.", "description": "The Equinox down comforter is a steal for its quality and as multiple reviewers note, something that even rivals the $200+ competitors that they've tried.", "authors": ["Connie Chen"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ab280f70860e884048b4613-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
