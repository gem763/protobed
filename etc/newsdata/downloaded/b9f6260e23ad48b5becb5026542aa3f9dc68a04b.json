However, he is expected to lose his majority government and lead a minority in Parliament instead.\n\nLiberals have won 146 seats in the Canadian Parliament with 34.4 percent of the vote share to Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservative Party\u2019s 117 seats with 33.3 percent of the vote, based on a preliminary tally reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nGoing into the election, CBC\u2019s Poll Tracker gave the Liberals a slight edge of 32 percent of the vote over the Conservative Party\u2019s 31.6 percent.\n\nHowever, Trudeau\u2019s win falls below the 170 seats needed for a majority and is a drop of more than 30 seats from the 2015 election when he rode into power on charisma, good looks and promises of re-liberalizing Canada\u2019s image that had been pulled right under the Conservatives\u2019 decade rule.\n\nThe source of Trudeau\u2019s drop this election could be that his image as the face of a liberal Canada that embraces all was tarnished shortly after the election campaign began in September when the first of three instances of the son of the former late Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau in brownface surfaced.\n\n\u201cThis is something I shouldn\u2019t have done many years ago,\u201d he said following the revelation of the picture of him dressed in brownface and a turban published in a 2000-2001 yearbook for a school he worked for at the time. \u201cI take responsibility for my decision to do that. I didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time. I now realize it was.\u201d\n\nCandidates attacked Trudeau for it including Scheer who has repeatedly stated he won\u2019t walk in Toronto\u2019s LGBT Pride Parade.\n\nSheer, 40, has also faced scandal during this campaign, as the right-wing candidate came under scrutiny for being a dual citizen holding a U.S. passport.\n\nWhen questioned during the campaign why he never mentioned his U.S. citizenship, he replied: \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked me before about it.\u201d\n\nThough he has since said he will renounce the citizenship he received through his U.S.-born father. However, the Conservatives made substantial gains from 2015, earning some 20 seats more than last time around.\n\nMeanwhile, the left-wing New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, who was seeking to build off 2015\u2019s 44 seats, took a substantial hit, dropping by nearly half. And the Bloc Quebecois, a party from Quebec, jumped by more than 25 seats from the 10 they garnered in the last election.", "description": "(UPI) -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party is projected to win enough seats to secure him a second four-year term.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1060611294-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
