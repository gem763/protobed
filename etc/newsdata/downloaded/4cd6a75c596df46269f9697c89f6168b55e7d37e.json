They were firm and consistent, and ultimately the E.U. got its way in the way it had foreseen.\u201d That meant forcing Britain to choose whether to keep the entire country in the customs union, as former Prime Minister Theresa May chose, or just Northern Ireland, as Mr. Johnson did.\n\nOf course there are serious concerns that Mr. Johnson might fail to win approval for this withdrawal agreement on Saturday in the British Parliament, much as Mrs. May failed to win approval for her deal three times. \u201cBut despite their anxieties of \u2018Here we go again,\u2019 the E.U. was willing to try,\u201d said Rosa Balfour, an analyst in Brussels with the German Marshall Fund. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen to be pulling the plug.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Johnson fails in Parliament and must request an extension beyond Oct. 31, as his Parliament has legislated, the European Union will provide one, Ms. Balfour said, presumably for a new election in Britain.\n\nEven if Mr. Johnson succeeds, European leaders worry that he is not sincere about negotiating a future trade agreement that hinders him from cutting British corporate taxes and regulations. They fear he will turn Britain into what Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has called another competitor with the bloc, but one that is right next door.\n\nBut it is crucial now that the European Union move beyond Brexit to face a complicated world, said Enrico Letta, the dean of the Paris School of International Affairs and a former prime minister of Italy. Thursday\u2019s summit was supposed to be devoted to finding an agreement on the bloc\u2019s next budget and deciding whether to open negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania about joining the bloc, he said. The Syria crisis is important now, and \u201cthere needs to be a strong European position,\u201d he said, especially when Vice President Mike Pence is in Ankara, the Turkish capital.\n\nMigration issues are unresolved, and the new European Commission has been delayed in taking office by battles within the European Parliament, Mr. Letta said. \u201cThe risk is to focus everything on Brexit and lose focus on everything else.\u201d\n\nMr. Rahman agreed. \u201cEurope has a whole set of challenges to get on with,\u201d he said. The new commission led by Ursula von der Leyen, who will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker, is supposed to be \u201ca geopolitical commission, with the mandate about Europe\u2019s place in the world \u2014 on trade, China, borders, the U.S., Russia \u2014 and less about internal matters.\u201d", "description": "Showing unusual flexibility but keeping its red lines, Brussels agreed to a quick Brexit deal with Boris Johnson, and hopes he can pass it at home.", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/world/18eu-brexit/18eu-brexit-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
