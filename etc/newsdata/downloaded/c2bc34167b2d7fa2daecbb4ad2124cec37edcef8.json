Asian indexes also climbed, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng advancing 2.3% and the Shanghai Composite gaining 0.9%.\n\nMr. Trump offered an upbeat assessment of the talks and said he would meet with China Vice Premier Liu He on Friday. Markets are hoping that Beijing's emissaries are ready to offer compromises aimed at getting Mr. Trump to hold off on tariff increases set to take effect next week and in December.\n\nTraders are cheered that talks have continued into a second day, said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets U.K.\n\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" Mr. Madden said. \"At the end of the day, if the two sides were not interested in having some progress, they wouldn't even be meeting today.\"\n\nCrude oil prices gained after an Iranian tanker near the Saudi Arabian coast suffered damage Friday in what the ship's owner suggested may have been a missile attack. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, jumped 1.4% to $59.92 a barrel. The alleged missile strike couldn't be independently verified and Iran's oil ministry later said there was no fire.\n\nThe British pound added 0.5% against the dollar, having posted its largest one-day jump since March on Thursday following signs of progress in the Brexit talks between the U.K. and Ireland. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar unexpectedly said they saw a chance of a Brexit deal.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.K. gilt continued to climb, rising to 0.619% from 0.462% Wednesday. Shares of British lenders soared, with Royal Bank of Scotland Group up 9.7% in London trading and Lloyds Banking Group 9% higher.\n\nShares in Publicis Groupe plunged 14% in Paris on Friday after the advertising giant lowered its guidance for the second time in a year. Luxury apparel maker Hugo Boss tumbled 13% after the German company cut its revenue and earnings guidance for the year.\n\nLater Friday, the University of Michigan will release a U.S. consumer sentiment measure that is likely to signal dimming expectations about the economic outlook. Investors will be watching the data to see if consumers are nervous enough to potentially curtail spending in the crucial months ahead.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 11, 2019 06:54 ET (10:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
