The report quoted an anonymous NBC insider as saying the woman complained to the network\u2019s human-resources officials Monday.\n\n\u201cThis happened so quickly,\u201d the insider told the Post. \u201cShe didn\u2019t go to the media, she made a complaint to NBC\u2019s human resources, and her evidence was so compelling that Matt was fired on Tuesday night. The victim says she has evidence that this has also happened to other women, but so far we don\u2019t have evidence of that.\u201d\n\nCNN reported The New York Times had been working on a story for weeks about Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Variety published its long-planned report about Lauer, cataloguing a series of allegations of sexual harassment made against him, including an occasion where he is reported to have presented a colleague with a sex toy as a present. \"It included an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her, which left her mortified.\n\n\"On another day, he summoned a different female employee to his office, and then dropped his pants, showing her his penis. After the employee declined to do anything, visibly shaken, he reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act.\"\n\nLauer, Variety reported, also liked to play a quiz game of \u201cfuck, marry or kill,\u201d with male and female colleagues, in which he would identify the female co-hosts that he\u2019d most like to sleep with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to say, Norah\u2026 that we know how they [Lauer\u2019s NBC News colleagues] feel,\u201d CBS This Morning co-anchor Gayle King said on the air, after her colleague Norah O\u2019Donnell reported that Rose has been the subject of \u201cat least three\u201d new sexual-harassment complaints from female employees at CBS News. \u201cWe know that feeling of reeling and shock,\u201d King continued, \u201cand how you just get through it one day at a time. It\u2019s a very, very sad story.\u201d\n\nPredictably, President Donald Trump was far less empathetic in a series of gloating tweets attacking NBC Chairman Lack, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, and even MSNBC President Phil Griffin.\n\n\u201cWow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for \u2018inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBut when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack\u2019s past!\u201d\n\nNBC News and MSNBC declined to comment on Trump\u2019s attacks.\n\nBut Scarborough tweeted: \u201cLooks like I picked a good day to stop responding to Trump\u2019s bizarre tweets. He is not well.\u201d\n\nLack said the complaint was received Monday night. \u201cIt represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company\u2019s standards,\u201d Lack said. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019ve decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d\n\nLack\u2019s statement continued: \u201cOur highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender. We are deeply saddened by this turn of events, but we will face it together as a news organization\u2014and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.\u201d\n\nGuthrie, who joined Lauer as Today\u2019s permanent cohost in 2012, kept her obviously strained composure as she discussed the terrible news with Hoda Kotb, sitting in for the banished Lauer.\n\n\u201cWe just learned this moments ago, just this morning,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you can imagine, we are devastated. We are still processing all of this. And I will tell you, we do not know more than what I just shared with you. But we will be covering this story, as reporters, as journalists. I\u2019m sure we will be learning more details in hours and days to come. And we promise we will share that with you.\u201d\n\nTurning to Kotb, Guthrie, near tears, added: \u201cAnd Hoda, I mean, you know, all we can say for the moment is that we are heartbroken. I am heartbroken for Matt. He is my dear, dear friend and my partner, and he is beloved by many, many people here.\n\n\u201cAnd I am heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story, and any other women who have their own stories to tell. We are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks: How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know the answer to that. But I do know that this reckoning that so many organizations have been going through is important, it\u2019s long overdue and must result in workplaces where all women, all people, feel safe and respected.\u201d\n\nGuthrie continued: \u201cAs painful as it is this moment in our culture, and this change, had to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it did,\u201d Kotb responded, her face as mask of sadness. \u201cThis is a very tough morning for both of us. I\u2019ve known Matt for 15 years, and I\u2019ve loved him as a friend and as a colleague. And again, just like you were saying, Savannah, it\u2019s hard to reconcile what we are hearing with the man who we know.\u201d\n\nKotb continued: \u201c We both woke up with this news, pre-dawn. We are trying to process it and trying make sense of it and it will take some time for that.\u201d\n\nGuthrie added, addressing viewers directly: \u201cWe are processing it with all of you at home. We promise to be transparent and straightforward and continue this important conversation\u2026 There\u2019s no real way to do this.\u201d\n\nGuthrie concluded: \u2018This show has been on air for more than 65 years. \u2026 We\u2019re supposed to bring you the news\u2026and so we move along\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd she transitioned to the show\u2019s second lead, and arguably less upsetting story: the ballistic-missile launch in North Korea.\n\nNBC newbie Megyn Kelly added her voice to the controversy on her eponymous program on Today\u2019s 9 a.m. hour.\n\n\u201cThis one does hit close to home,\u201d said the former Fox News star, grim-faced and straight to camera after showing clips of Guthrie and Kotb commiserating over Lauer\u2019s professional demise. \u201cI, too, have known Matt for a long time, and he has been a friend and kind and supportive to me in my transition to NBC News.\n\n\u201cI see the anguish on my colleagues\u2019 faces. When this happens, what we don\u2019t see is the pain on the faces of those who found the courage to come forward. It is a terrifying thing to do.\u201d\n\nKelly, whose complaint about her harassment by the late Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes was a major factor in Ailes\u2019s firing in July 2016, continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t see the career opportunities women lose because of sexual harassment, or the intense stress it causes a woman dealing with it when she comes to work each day. I am thinking of those women this morning, hoping they are OK.\n\n\u201cThe days to come will not be easy. We are in the middle of a sea change in this country, an empowerment revolution, in which women who for years felt they had no choice but to simply deal with being harassed at work are now starting to picture another reality, to feel that change is within their grasp.\n\n\u201cAs painful as this moment is for so many here at NBC today, at CBS earlier this month, at Fox News over the last year, in Hollywood this fall, it is a sign of progress, of women finding their voices, their courage, and of the erosion of a shameful power imbalance that has been in place for far too long\u2026\n\n\u201cMy experience is that a news organization is bigger than any one person. They all face challenges. They all stumble. But the good ones stay standing and forge forward, fulfilling their core mission: journalism.\u201d", "description": "The face of \u2018Today\u2019 is accused by at least one staffer of sexual misconduct, and several bombshell stories are expected to reveal more.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Tim Teeman", "Editor At Large", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1511968905/171129-grove-matt-lauer-hero-1_ul2cf1", "published_at": "2017-11-29"}
