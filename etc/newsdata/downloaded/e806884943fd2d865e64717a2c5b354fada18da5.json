He feels a whole mix of emotions, he feels betrayed by Ollie and Cindy. As a father, I can relate to how heartbreaking it must feel to have lost out on all of the times with baby DJ, the big moments.\u2019\n\nOn top of all that, would Luke ever be able to cope with the guilt that would come if his climbing into the digger resulted in someone\u2019s tragic demise?\n\nHollyoaks continues tonight at 7pm on E4.\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: A horrifying disaster leaves several residents for dead\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: James Nightingale plots revenge as Harry Thompson is laid to rest\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "It's all kicking off once again on Hollyoaks as the soap's infamous stunt week continues.
