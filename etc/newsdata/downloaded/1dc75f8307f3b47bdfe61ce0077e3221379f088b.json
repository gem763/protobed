NAACP wants Dallas police investigated after death of Guyger witness Joshua Brown", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Amber Guyger trial judge Tammy Kemp explained why she let Guyger and Brandt Jean, the brother of the man killed by Guyger, hug in court. Guyger said when Jean said please a second time, 'I just could not refuse him.' (Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nStory Highlights Joshua Brown, a key witness in the murder trial of Botham Jean, was found shot to death in a parking lot Friday.\n\nBrown's testimony was crucial in the case against ex-Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who was sentenced to 10 years for killing Jean.\n\nNow, NAACP legal fund is calling for an investigation into Dallas police and Brown's death.\n\nThe NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund is calling for an independent investigation into Dallas police and the death of Joshua Brown, a key witness in the murder trial of former officer Amber Gugyer convicted of killing a neighbor in his own apartment.\n\nBrown was found shot to death in a parking lot Friday, two days after Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the September 2018 fatal shooting Botham Jean as the accountant ate ice cream in an apartment Guyger mistook for her own.\n\n\"The murder of Botham Jean has raised troubling concerns from the beginning of the investigation, and now, the deeply alarming and highly suspicious murder of Joshua Brown increases the urgency of an immediate, independent investigation of every aspect of these two tragic killings,\" the defense fund said in a statement.\n\nBrown's testimony was crucial because he lived on the same floor as Guyger and heard them talking \u2013 but said he did not hear Guyger shout verbal commands or warnings before shooting Jean.\n\nHow many years will Guyger stay in prison? That could depend on Jean's family\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, the defense fund's president, said it is critical to public confidence in the criminal justice system that witnesses who speak out against police violence are fully protected. Ifill said she supports the call by Jean's family for a comprehensive federal investigation of the Dallas Police Department.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding the murder of Mr. Brown cries out for answers,\u201d Ifill said. \"We urge state or federal authorities to follow the trail of misconduct left by this case and fully investigate the circumstances surrounding Mr. Brown\u2019s death.\"\n\nIn this Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019, photo, victim Botham Jean's neighbor Joshua Brown, left, answers questions from Assistant District Attorney LaQuita Long, right, while pointing to a map of the South Side Flats where he lives, while testifying during the murder trial of former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger, in Dallas.

Lee Merritt, who represents the Jean and Brown families, said Brown had expressed concern to prosecutors about testifying at Guyger's trial. Two months after Jean's death, Brown was wounded by a gunman who killed another man outside a Dallas nightclub. Brown was concerned that shooter would be looking for him, Merritt said in a social media post Tuesday.\n\nBrown moved to California, but went back to Dallas to testify when prosecutors threatened to issue a warrant for his arrest, Merritt said.\n\n\"Brown\u2019s testimony was powerful but it was also duplicative,\" Merritt said. \"Nothing he testified to couldn\u2019t have been brought in by other witnesses. It wasn\u2019t worth his life.\"\n\nDallas police issued a statement Sunday saying they had no suspects or motives but were \"committed to solving this case and will work diligently\" to arrest those responsible for Brown's death.\n\nMayor Eric Johnson said he trusted police to conduct a thorough investigation into Brown's death.\n\n\"Until we know more about this incident, I encourage everyone to refrain from speculation,\" he said.\n\nConsider this: Brandt Jean forgiving, hugging Amber Guyger is one thing \u2014 the judge's hug is another\n\nGuyger, 31, told authorities that on the night of the shooting she returned home from an extended shift for the police department when she parked on the wrong floor of her apartment building's garage, walked down the wrong hallway and into the wrong apartment. She said she believed Jean, 26, was an intruder and shot him in self defense.\n\nDays later, Guyger was charged with murder and was fired. Last week, a jury convicted Guyger of murder and sentenced her to 10 years; under Texas state law, she must serve at least half the sentence to qualify for early release.\n\nJean's brother, Brandt, and Judge Tammy Kemp both hugged Guyger after her sentencing. Kemp also gave Guyger a Bible.\n\nTwo days later, police were called to a parking lot where Brown was found lying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\n\"I just spoke with Joshua Brown's mother. She is devastated. We all are,\" Merritt posted on Twitter the next day. \"Joshua Brown was key witness in the murder of Botham Jean that helped put Amber Guyger away. We need answers.\"\n\nCLOSE It was a moving moment when Brandt Jean asked the judge if he could hug Amber Guyger, the former Dallas cop who shot and killed his brother.
