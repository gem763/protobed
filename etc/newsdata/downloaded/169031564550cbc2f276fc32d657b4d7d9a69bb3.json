Neymar is very affected by many things, and at times many of those are unjust. Neymar has the sensibility of a child. But Ney is not a child, no. He is a man. People have to start learning to respect Neymar. The Ney of the Brazilian team people don't respect. People only respect you when you position yourself.\n\n'Ney has already won in football so he can talk and say what he wants. There are a lot that keep talking, commentating and haven't won anything. That is why I value that he [would] position himself, because when they say something that is not right about you whether it's [Walter] Casagrande or someone else, you have to stand up for yourself.'\n\nNeymar was heavily criticised during the 2018 World Cup in Russia as he tried to con officials through diving and Alves has revealed he spoke to him about his on-field behaviour.\n\n'I always give Ney advice,' Alves added. 'One of the things that I did speak with him about is that he should have positioned himself after the [2018] World Cup.\n\n'I told him he should have taken a stance because Ney is the flagship of the Brazil team. He continues to be our flagship. Today he is the most important Brazilian football player and Neymar is among the top in world football.\n\n'He needs to take a stance because he is in a place where he has to position himself and people have to understand who Ney is, how he thinks, and they have to start to learn and respect Neymar.'", "description": "Dani Alves has sent a warning to international team-mate Neymar by suggesting he must stop acting like a child if he is to be respected around the world.", "authors": ["Anthony Hay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20327022-0-image-a-38_1572355927703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
