[My cohost Tanya Rad and I] think that it\u2019s worse, the two months lyric that you have in there,\u201d Seacrest told Gomez on Thursday. \u201cThat part of us, would be worse than going through a breakup. Having to see someone move on so fast.\u201d\n\nGomez, 27, agreed with the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d host, adding, I\u2019m really grateful, too, because I\u2019ve experienced that a million times before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the unfortunate part about what I do,\u201d said Gomez. \u201cIt\u2019s all very real to me, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just entertainment for other people, but I think I had become numb to it.\u201d\n\nHAILEY BALDWIN SNAPS AT TROLLS SAYING SHE'S 'SECOND BEST' TO SELENA GOMEZ\n\nThe \u201cWizards of Waverly Place\u201d alum continued, telling Seacrest that she felt it would \u201cstupid\u201d of her not to at least allude to how she felt on record since it falls in line with the way she aims to live her life \u2013 as freely and honest as possible.\n\n\u201cIt would be inauthentic and that\u2019s everything I claim to be and do. I know there are thousands of people, men and women, who had felt this feeling and it\u2019s extremely real,\u201d said Gomez.\n\n\u201cAnd on top of the social media and everything, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in my decision or if you\u2019re in someone else\u2019s because you\u2019re always going to, somehow, find this negative space. That\u2019s why I have to be careful and take steps back. And just focus on what I\u2019m doing and no one else.\u201d\n\nGomez took to Instagram to defend Hailey Baldwin from internet hate after the latter posted a screenshot of a song she was listening to during the release of Gomez\u2019s comeback track, \u201cLose You to Love Me,\u201d on Wednesday. Baldwin shared the Summer Walker and Jhene Aiko record \u201cI\u2019ll Kill You,\u201d which a number of fans believed to be aimed at Gomez.\n\nSELENA GOMEZ DEFENDS HAILEY BALDWIN, DEBUTS NEW SINGLE 'LOOK AT HER NOW'\n\nHowever, a source close to Baldwin told Fox News on Wednesday that simply wasn't the case and the model only wanted to share with her followers what she was listening to and in no way was attempting to upstage or issue a reaction to Gomez\u2019s new song.\n\n\u201cSo many people were hitting Hailey up about Selena\u2019s new song, asking her if she had heard it and Hailey was basically saying \u2018No, I haven\u2019t because I\u2019m listening to this at the moment, not that,\u2019\u201d said the insider. \u201cHailey has a lot of love for Justin and she knows how much of a role Selena played in Justin\u2019s life. She could never disrespect his past like that. This is nothing.\u201d\n\nThough the lyrics of the Gomez\u2019s song seem to throw shade at her ex Justin Bieber, the singer advised fans that attacking Baldwin, Bieber\u2019s now-wife, is not appropriate behavior.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful for the response this song is getting. However, I do not stand for women tearing women down. And I will never, ever be by that,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cPlease be kind to everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter what the situation is \u2014 if you\u2019re my fan don\u2019t be rude to anyone, please,\u201d she said, seemingly alluding to Baldwin.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go off and say things that you just feel in the moment. Just please, for me, know that that\u2019s not my heart and my heart is only to release things I feel that are me and that I\u2019m proud of. And that\u2019s all that I\u2019ll say,\u201d Gomez concluded.\n\nFox News\u2019 Andy Sahadeo contributed to this report.", "description": "Selena Gomez came off as calculated on Wednesday when she released a new single \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d and included a lyric many fans believed to be aimed at her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber before doubling back and releasing \u201cLook at Her Now\u201d just hours later on Thursday.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Baldwin-Bieber-Gomez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
