He was on the practice field today Thursday getting ready as if he is playing. If there is nothing from the league - and I have received no indication right now that there definitely will be - then it would make sense that he would go out there and play unless there is something football-wise that would keep him off the field.\n\n\"Maybe the Patriots don't feel he's ready to pick up the gameplan or cannot contribute.
