Note also that Rubin did not recuse herself from that strategic decision. What about that?\n\nAnd while Rubin\u2019s directorship of Mirvac enabled her to buy an apartment in its Eastbourne development on Melbourne\u2019s Fitzroy Gardens before the general public got a look-in, it turns out she wasn\u2019t the only member of ME Bank\u2019s board to do so.\n\nMirvac directors Elana Rubin and Christine Christian were able to buy apartments in its Eastbourne development before the general public got a look-in Supplied\n\nTwo months after Rubin slapped down her deposit on a $1.89 million flat in the prestigious Albert Street sanctuary in May 2016, her fellow ME director Christine Christian did the same, but on one going for $2.99 million. That joint must be rather liveable.\n\nChristian, a former CEO of debt collector Dun & Bradstreet and now deputy chair of FlexiGroup, purchased her property through Molly Bloom Investments Pty Ltd, of which she is sole shareholder.\n\nChristine Christian: a presumed fan of Ulysses. Arsineh Houspian\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting name for a personal holding company, but certainly in character (pun intended). Because Christian (AKA Repo Woman?) is also a director of the State Library of Victoria and Molly Bloom was of course a character in James Joyce\u2019s literary masterpiece, Ulysses. Indeed, the novel \u2013 unlike ME board meetings, we trust \u2013 ends with her stream-of-consciousness soliloquy.\n\nUnless, of course, Christian is a mad poker player? The real Molly Bloom (born more than 200 years after the fictional opera singer cheated on Leopold with Blazes Boylan) ran high-stakes card games for Hollywood celebrities in Los Angeles and New York, before being swept up in an FBI investigation in 2013. She was played by Jessica Chastain in the 2017 film written by Aaron Sorkin. But we\u2019re going with the Joyce angle. It\u2019s not as if Christian\u2019s on the Village Roadshow board\u2026", "description": "Mirvac directors Elana Rubin and Christine Christian were able to buy apartments in the company's Eastbourne development before the general public got a look-in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7d2a920e85d59b9789d8ef3f2fcb6110c16c4fea", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
