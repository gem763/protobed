Meanwhile, Noah wore a witch outfit, complete with a pink wig.\n\nThe festive family posed in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle, the iconic Ferris wheel and a giant Mickey Mouse Jack-o'-lantern during their outing.\n\nFox's last Instagram photo of her kids was actually shared last Halloween, with all three of her boys and herself dressed up to go trick-or-treating.\n\nIn September, Fox sat down with ET to reflect on her career and watch some clips of her work and previous interviews, which she readily admits make her cringe. However, she also mentioned that at times she's impressed with how she conducted herself back when.\n\n\"It's weird. Because I've grown so much as a person, I would think that I would listen to myself talk and be like, 'God, who's that?!'\" Fox told ET. \"But I sound so similar, and the sentiments that I'm expressing are similar. I'm always taken aback when I listen to myself talk. Two things: I am eccentric, [but] sometimes I'm surprised at how eccentric I am. I'm also surprised at how deep I always was even as a young, young kid. You can tell that there's more to [that girl] that meets the eye. Get it? Get it? Transformers joke.\"\n\nSee more on Fox in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMegan Fox and Diablo Cody: The 'Jennifer's Body' 10 Year Anniversary Interview (Exclusive)\n\nMegan Fox Says Her Son Noah Is Criticized for Wearing Dresses to School\n\nMegan Fox Has 'Come Full-Circle' Since 'Transformers': 'Nothing I Experienced Is a Bad Thing' (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Fox's sons were all dressed up to celebrate Halloween at the theme park on Saturday.", "authors": ["Scott Baumgartner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2V3hKNBxbskYqtQLZek6xw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/119653f40a3a4ad847c5f69582b9a2cd", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
