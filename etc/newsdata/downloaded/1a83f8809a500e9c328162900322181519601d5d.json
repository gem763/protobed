Having your own personal area and being able to lay flat made this the best flight I have ever been on.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAs United recently reminded me, I've been a member of its Mileage Plus program for 31 years.\n\nMileage Plus is United's loyalty program that allows you to accumulate miles, all while earning different status levels each year. There are three status levels: Silver, Gold, Platinum or 1K. Members of the program must fly at least 25,000 Premium Qualifying Miles (PQM) and spend $3,000 each year to be a Premier Silver level member \u2014 and that's the lowest recognized premier level.\n\nWhile these status levels only last for one year, United has a lesser-known million-miler program that will earn you a lifetime status once you earn 1 million miles.\n\nOver the summer, I traveled to London Heathrow. I spent $910 on my roundtrip flight from Newark, NJ. As a planner, I try to book flights far in advance to get the best deal, but I delayed on booking this flight as I was traveling with my boyfriend and schedules were up in the air until a few weeks before. I spent about $200 more than I typically would have \u2014 but it worked out to my advantage because I was upgraded to Polaris Business Class for the flight back to Newark.\n\nHere's what it was like to fly on United's Polaris Business Class \u2014 and why it was worth every extra dollar.", "description": "I've been flying United religiously for more than seven years, and I just got my first upgrade to Polaris.
