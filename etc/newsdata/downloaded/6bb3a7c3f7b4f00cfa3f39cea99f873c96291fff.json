His latest problem could be more challenging.\n\nIn public, Trumpworld is casting the Democratic impeachment inquiry as more white noise.\n\nIn private, White House aides and allies say the impeachment momentum now presents a serious threat to the rest of President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, to his negotiating strength with world leaders and to his concentration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe political furor over the president\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president will contrast the two pictures for at least the coming weeks, testing how well the seemingly Teflon-encased president can withstand the revelation that he tried to pressure a foreign leader to dig up dirt on the son of a Democratic rival, Joe Biden, heading into the 2020 campaign.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 decision to launch an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday afternoon raises the stakes of this massive White House gamble, even as the president called any impeachment proceedings \u201cjust a continuation of the witch hunt.\u201d\n\nFew in the White House or the wider Trump orbit have privately defended Trump\u2019s call with the Ukraine leader in which he reportedly asked eight times about investigating the Biden clan\u2019s business dealings in the country. The incident violates the principle that U.S. officials should never allow or encourage foreign governments to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nTrump advisers and senior administration aides pivoted any discussion of the president\u2019s call and ensuing whistleblower complaint to focus on the Bidens \u2014 in an effort to turn the attention to a rival much the way the Trump campaign undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy in 2016 by constantly bringing the discussion back to her campaign\u2019s stolen emails.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans\u2019 impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. \u201cFor the average American, this won\u2019t move anything. It just further pins the Democrats into a negative anti-Trump position.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The absolutely worst thing he has ever done! You can excuse the public for believing nothing is that way,\u201d the official added.\n\nWhite House and Department of Justice lawyers are tuning out the media coverage and focusing on the legal nuances of the whistleblower statute, while the president is leading the ensuing political battle.\n\nLike any public relations guru, he has sought to get out ahead of the Ukraine story, set the boundaries of the narrative so that Biden is in the bull's-eye, and overwhelm Americans with new and often conflicting information so the details change by the hour \u2014 and always at his bidding.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s doing the best it\u2019s ever done. They\u2019re going to lose the election,\u201d Trump told reporters before a bilateral meeting with the Iraqi president at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a positive for me,\u201d he added about the impeachment proceedings.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Trump announced on Twitter that he intended to release on Wednesday a transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president. And a senior administration official said the White House also plans to release to Congress by the end of this week the whistleblower complaint and inspector general documents at the center of the fight.\n\nBoth moves suggest the White House is confident it can withstand any fallout from the Ukraine call.\n\nBut current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego \u2014 and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.\n\n\u201cIt would mean USMCA [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement] probably doesn't get done. It would declare war on whatever legislative agenda they still have,\u201d one former administration official said.\n\nThat may not matter for Trump\u2019s political standing or his popularity with his base, which has remained fairly constant during his presidency even in some of its most controversial moments.\n\n\u201cPeople have made up their minds on Trump. It would take a momentous event to change enough minds to alter his job approval rating away from the average of 43 or 44 percent,\u201d said Whit Ayres, founder and president of North Star Opinion Research, a Republican polling firm. \u201cWe\u2019re so polarized and in our tribes that people will look through their current lens and determine either the president did something wrong, or Joe Biden did something wrong. The facts won\u2019t be particularly relevant.\u201d\n\nThe White House press office framed the impeachment inquiry as the Democrats\u2019 effort to \u201ccontinue to weaponize politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is working hard on behalf of our country here in New York City while they continue to scream the word 'impeachment.' Nothing new here,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nAnd the president\u2019s 2020 campaign rushed to motivate Trump supporters and raise money from the fight. \u201cDemocrats can\u2019t beat President Trump on his policies or his stellar record of accomplishment, so they\u2019re trying to turn a Joe Biden scandal into a Trump problem,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \u201cThe misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump\u2019s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President.\u201d\n\nStill, the impeachment proceedings could lead to other revelations that are even more distracting for Trump and the GOP agenda.\n\nWhile the Democrats pushed ahead with the impeachment inquiry, the reaction in the Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday was more muted and mixed.\n\n\u201cIt will be similar to the Mueller report. Remember how much time we spent on that? It\u2019s got all the same characteristics,\u201d Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s amazing how you keep pushing a dynamic like that, and I think clearly, in this case, it\u2019s backfired, and its focused attention on Biden and his son.\u201d\n\nBoth Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska expressed the need for additional information, with Romney calling the release of the transcript a helpful way to clarify the president\u2019s intentions. \u201cIt would be much more helpful if we can just get the full and honest story out there,\u201d Murkowski told POLITICO. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about what was really said. So, hard to say until we see what\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nBut for Senate Democrats, the House\u2019s new impeachment inquiry seems justified.\n\n\u201cThis is very serious. I\u2019m not sure [Trump] understands how serious this is,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who supports impeachment. \u201cI\u2019m not sure intellectually, he personally understands how serious this is when you\u2019re holding up military assistance passed by Congress in order to extort a political action of a leader in a foreign country.\u201d\n\nBurgess Everett and Ben White contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump survived the explosive \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201c tape, the Charlottesville uproar, Stormy Daniels, the Mueller report and dozens of other threats to his presidency.
