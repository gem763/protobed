She\u2019s an adult and she can bone as many gorgeous Australian men as her heart desires. But we\u2019re also not going to call them a \u201ccouple\u201d either, it\u2019s still early days, folks.\n\nCody and Miley were apparently spotted picking up some groceries at a local store in LA on Thursday afternoon, where they shared a \u201cquick kiss\u201d, according to E! News. I too become very horny when picking out my breakfast cereal.\n\n\u201c[Cody] noticed people seeing them so they tried to rush out of there,\u201d an unnamed source told E!\n\nThe pair were also photographed getting lunch on Thursday at LA\u2019s Backyard Bowls.\n\nThe pair have been friends since back in 2015, where Cyrus apparently helped Simpson adjust to adult life after being thrusted into the spotlight at a young age.\n\n\u201cMiley is one of my best friends and she helps with some of that transitional stuff \u2013 trying to escape your childhood,\u201d Cody said back in 2015. \u201cShe\u2019s super open-minded and I\u2019m working on becoming more like that.\u201d\n\nAlthough the 2015 romantic rumours were never confirmed, the pair were photographed getting awfully cosy at Cyrus\u2019 Nashville property and at what looks like one of Cody\u2019s shows.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s not that weird for Cyrus and Simpson to be hanging out. They\u2019ve been friends for years and last time I checked, hanging out with the opposite sex doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019re DTF. However, macking on in your local grocery store is some serious couple-level PDA, so who knows? Maybe Miley is ready for another Australian beau, but I highly doubt she\u2019d be looking to settle down anytime soon.\n\nI just want Miley Cyrus to be happy.\n\nREAD MORE Miley And Kaitlynn Are Reportedly Splitsville Just Weeks After Going Public", "description": "Miley Cyrus has been spotted kissing Aussie musician Cody Simpson at a grocery store in LA on Thursday after getting lunch together.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pjimage-42.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
