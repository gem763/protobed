So we\u2019ve been a close unit, hence the reason it is quite an emotional success,\u201d Whyte said. \u201cMy last ride, first Class Two winner.\u201d\n\nUncle Steve has been a difficult horse to handle since arriving in Hong Kong \u2013 he can be very nervous and not easy to control \u2013 but he has always had ability, it\u2019s just getting him to deliver on it that has been a challenge.\n\nWhyte was full of praise for his former trainer John Moore, who looked after the gelding initially, but was delighted his hard work had paid off.\n\n\u201cJohn did a fantastic job with him \u2013 he got him at the worst stage of his career \u2013 he was a handful, he was naughty, he was uneducated as far as manners go,\u201d Whyte said.\n\n\u201cFortunately I had a lot to do with him while he was with John and since he\u2019s come over to me I think he\u2019s enjoyed the environment of the Olympic side, it\u2019s a lot more laid-back there and I think he\u2019s been able to mentally settle and he hasn\u2019t put a foot wrong. He\u2019s really heading in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWhyte\u2019s had four winners from eight meetings with 43.3 per cent of his runners finishing in the top three \u2013 better than anyone else \u2013 which proves he is off to a flying start, but this sort of result reiterates that he is doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIt does. My horses are running well and I\u2019ve gone home and I\u2019ve been satisfied with just about everything,\u201d Whyte said.\n\n\u201cA horse like him, it is very rewarding and emotional because he has been a handful. He\u2019s indicating to me that he wants to race and he\u2019s enjoying it and he wants to be out there and competing as opposed to being a horse that does things wrong. That result today gave me a lot of pleasure.\n\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve given him one more gallop or you could\u2019ve given him a harder trial \u2013 you\u2019re always doubting. Have I gone there too fresh? But in the end, he is a fragile horse, we all know that, his nerves work on him, so backing off and giving him less was the winning formula today.\u201d", "description": "There is not a lot of time for sentimentality in the cutthroat world of Hong Kong racing, but for Douglas Whyte the victory of Uncle Steve certainly means more than most....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars", "Sam Agars Tom Biddington"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/06/bfbc3180-e835-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293e_image_hires_205239.JPG?itok=JtWq2RZ3&v=1570366366", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
