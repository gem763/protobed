Furthermore, trading across borders was made easier by improving the online processing of export customs declarations, as a result, time to export border compliance reduced from 63 to 56 hours.\n\n- Myanmar started publishing performance measurement reports to ease contract enforcement, in addition to introducing an online platform for company registration and reducing incorporation fees to make starting a business easier among other reforms.\n\nWith three reforms in the past year, the Philippines continued its reform momentum.

Resolving a commercial dispute through a local first-instance court costs on average 47.2 per cent of the claim value, more than twice the average of 21.5 per cent among OECD high-income economies.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES ASEAN Business - Singapore has retained its place as second best on a World Bank ranking for the world's easiest place to do business even as the overall pace of reforms in the East Asia and Pacific region slows.\u00a0 .
