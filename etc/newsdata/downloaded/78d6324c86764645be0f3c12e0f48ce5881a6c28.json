Osuna has been accused of domestic violence.\n\n\u201cTaubman turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, \u2018Thank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so f*cking glad we got Osuna!,\u201d the magazine reported.\n\nOsuna was accused of assaulting his girlfriend in 2018 when he was playing for the Blue Jays. The charges were eventually dropped when the accuser took off to Mexico and refused to help prosecutors on the case.\n\nStill, the Astros fully deny the accusation that Taubman was taunting women over domestic violence and called the magazine\u2019s article \u201ccompletely irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time,\u201d the team said according to TMZ.\n\nThe Astros added, \u201cHis comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2014 they were also not directed toward any specific reporters.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nStill, the Houston Chronicle claims that at least two reporters have confirmed Sports Illustrated\u2019s version of events.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Houston Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman is under fire for allegedly taunting female reporters.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Tim-Warner-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
