Promotion officials announced the booking Tuesday.\n\nWard and Penini had been scheduled to meet at Bellator 227 in Dublin about a month ago, but a Ward injury took the fight off the card. Bellator Europe 6 takes place Nov. 23 at The SSE Arena, Wembley, in London. The event will simulcast on tape delay in the U.S. on Paramount and DAZN. The Bellator Europe 6 portion of the card will stream live in the U.S. on MMA Junkie.\n\nWard has won four straight fights after he was cut loose from the UFC on a two-fight skid in 2017. After signing with Bellator, he has four knockout finishes, including three in the first round. In June, he stopped Justin Moore at Bellator 223 with a second-round TKO.\n\nPenini, a former Venator FC champion, will be making his promotional debut. The 26-year-old has back-to-back wins in his native Italy, but he\u2019ll be fighting for the first time in 2019 when he steps into the cage with Ward.\n\nWith the addition, the Bellator Europe 6 lineup includes:", "description": "A middleweight fight planned for Dublin earlier this fall has been rebooked for Bellator's return to London.", "authors": ["Mmajunkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/charlie-ward-bellator-200-2.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
