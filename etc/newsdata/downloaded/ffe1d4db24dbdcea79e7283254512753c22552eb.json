In one selfie, a train station sign was reflected in her eyes.\n\nHe located the station, from which she regularly commuted, by zooming in on the selfie and then used Google Street View to identify the station, police said.\n\nAn investigator told Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun: \u201cPeople should be fully aware that posting pictures and video on social media runs the risk of divulging personal data.\u201d\n\nLost chapter of world's first novel found in Japanese storeroom Read more\n\nThe 26-year-old man, whom police have named to local media as Hibiki Sato, is accused of waiting at the station on the night of 1 September before following the woman home and assaulting her, the BBC reported. He was arrested after security camera images were scrutinised.\n\nPolice said he told them he had looked at videos and pictures posted by the victim to her social media and had gleaned clues about her apartment, analysing the placement of curtains and angle of natural light to work out roughly which floor her apartment was on.\n\nIn 2016, a female Japanese pop singer was the victim of a stabbing attack that left her in a critical condition, from a fan who said he was angry that she had refused to accept a gift he sent her.\n\nTomohiro Iwazaki was arrested after allegedly stabbing Mayu Tomita more than 20 times in the neck, chest, arms and back while she was waiting to go onstage in Tokyo.
