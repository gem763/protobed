That allows Slack to work as a partner across all the software a business uses, from Microsoft and Google to Salesforce and Workday and startups.\n\nHenderson insists Slack is doing well \u2014 even at companies that are big Microsoft Office users.\n\n\"We've seen some of our fastest growth in Microsoft shops,\" Henderson said, noting that at least 70% of the company's top 50 customers use Office 365.\n\nWhat's next: Expect more tough words at Slack's Spec user conference, which kicks off today in San Francisco.", "description": "Slack maintains it is still dominant over Microsoft's Teams product when it comes to what workers are actually using.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/XXUYMxoMah5cD2x5FaYWAhhZuCY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/22/1571752586564.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
