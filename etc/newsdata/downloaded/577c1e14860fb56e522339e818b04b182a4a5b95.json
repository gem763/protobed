Came home, cried a little bit, ate quite a lot of ice cream \u2013 which I probably shouldn\u2019t do as it\u2019s not very good for the throat, dairy!\u2019\n\n\u2018Then I got a phone call after what felt like the longest time, it was quite a wait, and I got a phone call from Simon inviting me to come back,\u2019 she revealed.\n\nAs Eamonn probed about whether Simon would ever admit he was wrong about her, she laughed and coyly said: \u2018Not quite! But it was inferred. I inferred it from what he said.\u2019\n\nJenny beamed as she revealed Simon called her himself to ask her back (Picture: ITV)\n\nRuth then suggested that it was the fan reaction that caused the sudden change of heart and Jenny appeared to confirm that it was.\n\n\u2018I was not expecting that level of support from the public, after my first audition last week, the flood of comments I had was overwhelming,\u2019 The Vixen confirmed.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d spend half an hour looking at comments and had to stop because I was crying too much.\u2019\n\nJenny reveals Simon had a change of heart and brought her back after fan backlash (Picture: Rex)\n\n\u2018I have to say thank you to everybody who took the time, to write in and make their feelings known,\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018Because even if I didn\u2019t get to the live shows, or they didn\u2019t change their mind and put me through, that wave of affection and admiration I got was enough to lift anyone.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: The X Factor Why has Jenny Ryan returned to X Factor: Celebrity?
