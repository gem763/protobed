This is plenty of time to ratify our deal\".\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [LONDON] The British Prime Minister is expected to make a fresh attempt on Tuesday to force an early election, despite MPs rejecting his plan, after the European Union agreed to postpone Brexit for up to three months. .
