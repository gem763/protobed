By way of prep, the meat gets nothing more than salt on both sides a minute before it\u2019s cooked. Any fat that weeps out runs down channeled grating rather than dripping on the fire.\n\nHaving written four books on home grilling, I was puzzled by this. A virtue of the grill, I had been taught, is that the dripping fat infuses the meat with appealing smokiness.\n\n\u201cI want only the pure taste of beef, no smoke,\u201d said Pablo Rivero , the owner of Don Julio , who shepherded the restaurant from its early days as a mom-and-pop establishment to its current renown as the go-to parrilla (a word that connotes both a grill and a steakhouse) in beef-besotted Buenos Aires.\n\nMr. Rivero , 40, is a leading figure in the rebirth of the city\u2019s steakhouses, along with such chefs as Santiago Garat at Corte Comedor and Leo Lanussol at Proper. For years, classic Buenos Aires cuisine was largely defined by old-fashioned parrillas , and local joints \u2014 known as bodegones \u2014 that serve milanesas, empanadas and heavy red-sauce Italian fare. Now it\u2019s easy to find good bread, unapologetically pungent Patagonian cheeses and housemade pickled vegetables in addition to superb meat.", "description": "The owner, Pablo Rivero, shepherded the restaurant from its beginnings as a mom-and-pop restaurant to its current perch as the top steakhouse in Argentina.", "authors": ["Peter Kaminsky"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/dining/10Julio-slide-show-slide-LIMF/10Julio-slide-show-slide-LIMF-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
