She has long been a critic of the current president, and in January of this year released \u201cThe Case for Impeaching Trump,\u201d which detailed allegations of what she views as violations of the Emoluments Clause. The book also took issue with Trump over his policy of separating families who illegally cross the U.S. border with Mexico, what Holzman sees as his obstruction of investigations into his potential abuse of power and his refusal to harden the election system to avoid further interference.\n\nThose allegations, which predate by months and years the ones in the whistleblower\u2019s report that came to light this week, are why Holtzman is urging this generation's investigators to pursue multiple lines of inquiry.\n\nTo those pundits and politicians who are saying it might be simpler politically to focus only on Trump\u2019s urging the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son, she responds that, because impeachment is a dramatic remedy, it requires a dramatic rationale.\n\n\u201cThe constitutional framers argued about exactly this,\u201d she said, noting that some of the founding fathers suggested that an impeachment provision was not necessary because \u201cwe have elections and we will solve the problem of a bad president with elections.\u201d Others at the constitutional convention pushed back \u2014 and won \u2014 by arguing that \u201ca president can become such a danger to democracy that he has to be removed promptly.\u201d\n\nRep.

You show a number of grave, egregious abuses of power, you show that this is not an isolated act but a systemic use of power by the President of the United States against the constitution and the people of the United States.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cWe didn\u2019t just impeach Nixon for a coverup. We had a many-pronged charge with regard to the coverup, but then we also had abuses of power, illegal wire tapping, the enemies list, the break-in to Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist. This was not one thing, but a president that had gone amuck and that is what created the danger to democracy.\u201d\n\nThe same case can be made with Trump, Holtzman believes, but says that there is work to be done by Congress. \u201cI think the case is very strong at this point, it\u2019s just a question of can they put it together and acquire the additional evidence that needs to be acquired.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019.

Representatives need to \u201cget a lot tougher,\u201d Holtzman said, and use such tools as contempt charges, fines, \u201cwarnings that they will draw the most serious adverse inference from refusal to cooperate that they can.\u201d Should all that fail, she added, Democrats in Congress should \u201cget out some fresh sheets, clean out the [detention] room in the Capitol and arrest them.\u201d", "description": "Elizabeth Holtzman, a former member of the Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach President Richard Nixon, warned Democrats in charge of making the case against Donald Trump need to learn some lessons from the past.", "authors": ["Lisa Belkin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TOfPDxV_gWG3o5FoWcdH7g--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/1c15c4e0-e0b2-11e9-b73e-7d37519ec354", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
