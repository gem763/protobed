(Francois Lenoir/Reuters)\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is expected to break from President Trump in his testimony to Congress on Thursday and tell lawmakers that according to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the president wanted Ukraine to investigate both the 2016 election and the Ukrainian gas company tied to Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nGiuliani reportedly told diplomats, including Sondland, that a Ukrainian corruption investigation into the natural-gas company Burisma, on whose board the younger Biden once sat, was an issue \u201cof importance for the president.\u201d\n\nDuring a July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to help his administration investigate allegations that Joe Biden used his position as vice president to help Burisma Holdings avoid a corruption probe soon after Hunter Biden was appointed to its board of directors. The phone call led to an Intelligence Community whistleblower complaint that ultimately sparked a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nSondland, a millionaire hotel owner and major Trump donor, has become a closely watched figure in the impeachment probe because of his heavy involvement in diplomacy with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cMy understanding was that the president directed Mr. Giuliani\u2019s participation, that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the concerns of the president,\u201d Sondland will tell lawmakers, according to his prepared remarks, which were leaked just as he began testifying behind closed doors before the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe were also disappointed by the president\u2019s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Sondland will say. \u201cBased on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign,\u201d Sondland plans to say.\n\nZelensky has since said that \u201cnobody pushed me\u201d regarding the investigation, and Trump has claimed the same.\n\nBiden, for his part, has admitted that in the spring of 2016, during his tenure as vice president, he called on Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor investigating the energy company paying his son, though he has denied that there was anything improper in his actions. Biden suggested he would withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine if the country did not fire the prosecutor, who was accused by the State Department and U.S. allies in Europe of being soft on corruption.", "description": "U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is expected to break from President Trump in his testimony to Congress on Thursday.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
