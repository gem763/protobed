Tygart said in a statement to FOX Business.\n\nParker, who has served as Nike\u2019s CEO since 2006, drew renewed scrutiny this week after the American Arbitration Association issued four-year bans to Alberto Salazar, head of the prestigious Nike Oregon Project, and a Nike-backed doctor, Jeffrey Brown. A report prepared for anti-doping agency detailed evidence that Parker and other Nike executives had direct knowledge of their experiments with banned substances, including an effort to determine how much testosterone cream would cause a failed drug test.\n\nNike stock fell slightly in trading Wednesday alongside a broader market sell-off.\n\n\"The panel found there was no orchestrated doping, no finding that performance enhancing drugs have ever been used on Oregon Project athletes, and went out of its way to note Alberto\u2019s desire to follow all rules,\" Nike said in a statement. \"The decision had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete.\"\n\nIn one July 2009 email exchange, Parker told Brown that it would \u201cbe interesting to determine the minimal amount of topical male hormone required to create a positive test.\u201d\n\nA company spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that Parker\u2019s discussions with Salazar arose out of concern that Nike-sponsored athletes could be targeted for sabotage involving topical substances, rather than a doping effort.\n\n\u201cMark was shocked that this could be the case and given Mark\u2019s passion for running, Dr. Brown and Alberto made Mark aware of their findings,\u201d the spokesman told the Journal. \u201cMark Parker had no reason to believe that the test was outside any rules as a medical doctor was involved. Furthermore, Mark\u2019s understanding was that Alberto was attempting to prevent doping of his athletes.\u201d\n\nParker also addressed the report's findings in a memo to Nike employees this week, noting that recent reports had \"called into question whether I've lived up to our values in connection with information shared with me on the Oregon Project.\"\n\n\u201cAs this work was carried out with a medical doctor, I had no reason to believe the test was outside any rules,\" Parker said in the memo. \"Alberto was attempting to prevent doping of athletes \u2014 exactly the opposite of some of the commentary you may have heard. I wanted to understand what was going on. Nike did not participate in any effort to systematically dope any runners ever; the very idea makes me sick.\"\n\nCiting determinations by independent arbitration association panels, the anti-doping agency said Salazar and Brown received their sanctions for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct,\u201d including evidence tampering and trafficking of testosterone.\n\nSalazar has denied wrongdoing and vowed to appeal the anti-doping agency\u2019s decision. Brown has yet to publicly comment.\n\nEarlier this week, Nike expressed support for Salazar\u2019s decision to appeal the ruling and said it \u201cdoes not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.\u201d\n\nThe arbitrators' report noted that while Salazar had committed violations, they did not appear to have occurred out of an effort to cheat at competition.\n\n\"The Panel notes that the Respondent [Salazar] does not appear to have been motivated by any bad intention to commit the violations the Panel found. In fact, the Panel was struck by the amount of care generally taken by Respondent to ensure that whatever new technique or method or substance he was going to try was lawful under the World Anti-Doping Code, with USADA\u2019s witness characterizing him as the coach they heard from the most with respect to trying to ensure that he was complying with his obligations,\" the report said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "A Nike-backed running coach and doctor received four-year bans this week for their experiments with performance-enhancing drugs.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Mark-Parker.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
