Just what kind of royal future do Harry and Meghan want?\n\nThe documentary was presented by Harry\u2019s pal Tom Bradby, and as a result felt rather like a particularly long video clip on Harry and Meghan\u2019s Instagram feed.\n\nBradby, who brings to the art of cross-examination the ferocity of a pet sheep, will no doubt be delighted at his role in creating what was arguably the most nakedly emotionally manipulative piece of royal television served up to British viewers since Diana met Martin Bashir for the notorious edition of BBC's Panorama, in which she spoke of the \u201cthree people\u201d in her marriage to Prince Charles (the third being Camilla Parker Bowles).\n\nFor Harry, the trauma of Diana's death runs visibly deep. In the documentary he even appeared to be attempting to weaponize her memory. In a segment widely reported before Sunday, Harry said that every time a camera flashes it reminds him of her tragic fate.\n\nAsked by Bradby if he felt at peace about his mother\u2019s death in 1997 or if it is \u201cstill a sort of wound that festers,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI think probably a wound that festers. I think being part of this family, and this role, and this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back.\n\n\u201c Everything that I do reminds me of her. But, as I said, with the role, with the job and the ... sort of the pressures that come with that I get reminded of the bad stuff unfortunately \u201d\n\n\u201cIn that respect ... it\u2019s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best. The last time I was here was in 2013. But being here now, twenty-two years later trying to finish what she started, yeah will be, will be incredibly emotional.\n\n\u201cBut everything that I do reminds me of her. But, as I said, with the role, with the job and the ... sort of the pressures that come with that I get reminded of the bad stuff unfortunately.\u201d\n\nHis father Prince Charles, by contrast, was not mentioned once. Bizarrely, however Chazzer popped up during one of the commercial breaks, in a trailer for a forthcoming TV show about his country estate.\n\nCharles was pictured chuckling along with a jolly and toothless son of the soil who appeared absolutely honored to be being thus patronized, against a backdrop pf rolling English countryside and livestock, a strange reminder of what royalty used, not very long ago, to be.\n\nThen we were back to the new royals, new Angolan minefields and Harry talking, yes, once again, about his mother.\n\n\u201cI will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,\u201d Harry declared at one point, as a roaring camp fire blazed.\n\nWhile some of the documentary was indeed given over to Harry and Meghan's work in Africa, we swiftly cut back to the tear-jerking interviews with kids who had lost limbs to land lines, intercut with guess-who-yes-that\u2019s-right-Diana having the same conversations 22 years ago.\n\nWe even had a reunion between a young land mine victim who had met Diana for a famous photo in 1997 and now had five children herself one of whom, we were informed with astonishing predictability, was called Diana.\n\nThe centerpiece of the film was however Harry's fireside interview with Bradby. It really seems like Harry is going through a particularly bad patch right now. He did at one stage talk about the need for \u201cmanagement,\u201d of his mental health problems, saying, \u201cI thought I was out of the woods and suddenly it all came back.\u201d\n\nIt was extraordinary TV, and there were as an overwhelming sense that Harry had just decided to say all this stuff without consulting any communications professionals.\n\n\u201c We don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we are so busy\u2026 but you know as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days \u201d\n\nFor instance at one stage Bradby asked him if the rumors of a rift with his brother were true.\n\nHarry conspicuously failed to deny it and instead replied: \u201cPart of this role, and this job, being part of this family and the pressure this family is under, inevitably stuff happens, but we are brothers, we will always be brothers, we are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.\u201d\n\nCrikey. It seems things are even worse than we thought, an impression that was confirmed as Harry continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we are so busy\u2026 but you know as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d\n\nThere was time for a quick cut to a clip of 15-year-old Harry talking about how he hoped to make his mother proud which appeared to be there for no other reason than to make us cry, which it did.\n\nAnd then it was day nine and in a slight alteration to the official program, Harry launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday and denounced the press as liars and relentless propagandists.\n\nBradby gave the first truly impartial assessment of the situation saying, \u201cThe media thought they had gone mad,\u201d before quickly realizing the error of his ways and gravely informing us that actually this was part of a \u201cmoral mission to not be bullied.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nAfter all this it was time for Meghan to be brave and give a heartfelt, 5-minute interview in the grounds of the embassy to Bradders.\n\nThe stand out fact for me was that she calls Harry \u201cH.\u201d\n\nAsked about how the last year had been, Meghan said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard\u2026I had no idea which probably sounds difficult to understand here, but when I first met my now-husband my friends were really happy because I was so happy but my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great. But, you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life.\u2019 And I very naively\u2014I\u2019m American we don\u2019t have that there\u2014said, \u2018What are you talking about? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019 I didn\u2019t get it. So, it\u2019s been complicated.\u201d\n\nBradby, untroubled by the bizarre claim that the home of the National Enquirer boats a tabloid-free media landscape, asked about her mental health. \u201cAny woman, especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging. And then when you have a newborn, you know. And especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot. So, you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed.\n\n\u201c You\u2019ve got to thrive, you\u2019ve got to feel happy. I think I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried. I tried. But I think what that does internally is probably really damaging \u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for asking. Not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK, but it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Bradby asked Meghan if that meant she wasn\u2019t OK, she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBradby then asked he if she could \u201cput up with it\u201d and \u201ccontinue\u201d to which Meghan replied: \u201cI\u2019ve said for a long time to H\u2014that\u2019s what I call him\u2014it\u2019s not enough to just survive something. That\u2019s not the point of life. You\u2019ve got to thrive, you\u2019ve got to feel happy. I think I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried. I tried. But I think what that does internally is probably really damaging.\u201d\n\nBradby seemed rather aghast mumbling off camera that a stiff upper lip \u201chad its advantages,\u201d but Meghan was not to be swayed.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be fair,\u201d Meghan said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile.\u201d\n\nFair? What gave you that idea Meghan? The murder of the princes in the tower? The beheading of Anne Boleyn as a witch? The vast unfathomable wealth of you, your children and your children\u2019s children? Surely Meghan had seen, or had knowledge, the long and vexed relationship between the royals and the British media.\n\nMeghan finally lost her patience with Bradby when he raised the whole unimaginable wealth thing.\n\n\u201cI think the grass is always greener. You have no idea. It\u2019s really hard to understand what it\u2019s like. I know what it seems like it should be, but it\u2019s a very different thing,\u201d she snapped.\n\nBradby called an end to proceedings at this point, telling Meghan she must be exhausted.\n\nBradby then really showed his affinity to Harry and Meghan by claiming that the African tour had been \u201cby any conventional measure a success,\u201d which I suppose you would only disagree with if you think that alienating the entire media corps with whom you are going to have to work with for the rest of your life represented a great triumph.\n\nIn which case, yup, well done guys, way to go. The coming weeks and months will see how far the reverberations of this interview ripple out\u2014and what kind of royal life Harry and Meghan really want, and whether the royal family and media will welcome it.", "description": "In an explosive TV documentary screened Sunday, Prince Harry confirmed his rift with brother William and railed against the press, while Meghan said she hasn't been treated fairly.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571612261/GettyImages-1173714060_1_wx5uln", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
