Reminder: There are 136 days until the Iowa caucuses and 410 days until the 2020 presidential election.\n\n[Who\u2019s running for president? Click here for Yahoo News\u2019 2020 tracker]\n\nIt\u2019s an ironclad law of presidential primary politics: With increased success comes increased scrutiny. And it looks like Elizabeth Warren is about to get her turn in the hot seat.\n\nAfter fumbling a Native American DNA test \u2014 a misstep that threatened to overshadow her nascent campaign \u2014 the Massachusetts senator went on to enjoy a months-long streak of positive press coverage. Her debate opponents mostly declined to attack her, choosing to target frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden instead. As a result, Warren ticked up steadily in the polls, week after week; now she ranks second nationally in an average of recent polls, a bit ahead of fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nYet there are signs the honeymoon may be ending. The first clue came during last week\u2019s ABC News debate, during which Biden, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg all explicitly criticized Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All, claiming that it would cost too much, that it would raise taxes on the middle class, and that it would force people off their private insurance.\n\nThe more ominous development, however, is how Buttigieg in particular has decided to spend the week following the debate. Introducing his own health care proposal in a Thursday op-ed, Buttigieg took Warren and Sanders to task, by name, for wanting to \u201cfli[p] a switch and kic[k] almost 160 million Americans off their private insurance, including 20 million seniors already choosing private plans within Medicare.\u201d\n\nThen he implied that Warren in particular was not being \u201chonest and straightforward about the details\u201d of how she would pay for her plan.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question \u2014 and we have seen that repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg added Thursday in an interview with Jake Tapper. \u201cPeople are used to Washington politicians not giving straight answers to simple questions. But at a time like this, on an issue this important, that\u2019s exactly what we need.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ckicking people off private insurance\u201d argument certainly has some purchase among Democratic primary voters, which is why Democrats running to Warren\u2019s right keep pushing it. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, for instance, found that 55 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prefer to vote for a candidate who intends to build on the Affordable Care Act, while only 40 percent prefer to vote for a candidate who wants to replace the ACA with Medicare for All.\n\nBut the most interesting part of Buttigieg\u2019s critique is the part about Warren\u2019s character. On several occasions, Warren has refused, unlike Sanders, to say that she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for Medicare for All, insisting only that overall health care costs would go down with the elimination of premiums, copayments and deductibles.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s clear that Warren is trying to avoid handing Republicans a general-election sound bite on tax increases. In other words, she\u2019s acting like a politician. But that\u2019s the thing: Warren has built her brand on being a nonpolitician \u2014 a middle-class fighter who came to Washington to make \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s strategy here is simple. To have any chance of winning the nomination, he needs to overperform in Iowa, the first caucus state. Warren is leading or tied with Biden in the most recent polls; Buttigieg is hovering around third place. Warren voters and Buttigieg voters tend to overlap; they\u2019re mostly college-educated and white. If he can \u201cattack her strength\u201d \u2014 in this case, her reputation as a no-holds-barred truth teller \u2014 perhaps he can sow some doubts, surprise people on caucus day and propel his campaign forward.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s puzzling that, when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan and Senator Sanders\u2019 plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn\u2019t just say so, and then explain why you think that\u2019s the better way forward,\u201d Buttigieg told Tapper.", "description": "It\u2019s an ironclad law of presidential primary politics: With increased success comes increased scrutiny.
