(Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)\n\nSoftened shock jock Howard Stern is still able to surprise his wife, Beth Stern.\n\nThe SiriusXM host who doesn't hold back popped the question to his spouse while appearing on Wednesday's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\n\nStern recalled a trip he and the late night host took to Tennessee, where he shared around the dinner table that he keeps proposing to his wife since 2008 that they marry again, only for her to decline.\n\n\"I'm talking to Jimmy, and I said, 'You know, it's embarrassing. I have asked my wife to remarry me. We got married \u2026 11 years ago, but we've been together like 20-something years.\"\n\nStern remembered saying to Kimmel: \"Watch this, I'm gonna say to my wife, 'I want to remarry you. I want to propose,' and I'm gonna say, 'Marry me again.' She always says no. Because she thinks it's jinxed if you get married again, but it's so great. I love the proposal.\"\n\nHoward Stern on apologizing to Robin Williams, turning down Trump, grilling Weinstein\n\nHoward Stern goes after Wendy Williams: 'Keep your opinion to yourself'\n\n\"When I propose to my wife, she gets embarrassed,\" Stern continued, \"and she just \u2013 honey, come up here. I want to propose.\"\n\nTaking Beth's hands and dropping to a knee, Stern told her, \"Darling, you know you have given me the best years of my life. I love you so much. You do so much for animal rescue. You know how I feel about you. I'm gonna say to you now, in front of all of my best friends (gestures to studio audience), my sweet love, will you marry me again?\"\n\nAfter a simple \"yes,\" the two shared a short peck.\n\nEarlier in the year, Beth debunked split rumors as a guest on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in January.\n\nThe rumor mill began earlier in the month when the pair had a disagreement, and Beth told her husband that he was being \"grumpy\" and a \"Debbie Downer.\"\n\nStern then discussed their issues on air, which fueled reports. She said strangers stopped her in the street and wished her well.\n\n\"The other day, someone comes up to me and said, 'I\u2019m so sorry about what\u2019s going on with you and Howard, I hope you make it,' \" Beth recalled. \"I had no idea what was going on.\"\n\nDenying the reports, she said: \"I\u2019m setting the record straight right here.
