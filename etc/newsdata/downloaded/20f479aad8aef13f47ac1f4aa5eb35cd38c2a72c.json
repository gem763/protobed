Born in 1666 in Lechbruck in Bavaria, David Tecchler was one of the finest German luthier's of the 17th Century. Little is known about his life, except that he travelled to Rome in his 20s where he began crafting string instruments. In the late 17th Century, demand for string instruments was soaring. Although his cellos and double basses were most sought, his violin's are also prized. Ray Shows, founding member of the Artaria String Quartet plays a violin by David Tecchler from 1726.\n\nHe said: 'According to my colleagues playing this other violin hasn't affected my performance but it is was like having my arm cut off.\n\n'The way my instrument responds is like having a limb - your hand and brain know exactly where to go when playing.'\n\nTecchler was part of the renowned Roman School of Violin Making in the 17th Century and was considered to be the institution's leading violin and cello maker.\n\nThe instrument had recently been restored and was in a white case when it was left on the train. It was also marked with Tecchler's name.\n\nMr Morris had been on the 22.58 London Victoria to Orpington service on Tuesday when he lost the instrument.\n\nHe said he had been told by BTP they would be looking through CCTV to see if anyone left the train with the violin.", "description": "Stephen Morris, who left the \u00a3250,000 instrument on the London to Orpington service Tuesday night, has now launched a desperate public search.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20275586-0-image-a-5_1572260508843.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
