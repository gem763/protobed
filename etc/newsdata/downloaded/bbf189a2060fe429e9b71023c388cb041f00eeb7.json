The guest and her companion, who helped with the shot, disembarked in Jamaica \u201cas a result of their actions,\u201d the company said in a statement to media. The companion is banned too.\n\nA fellow passenger on the Allure of the Seas ship told CNN he witnessed the risky photo-shoot from his balcony and brought it to the crew\u2019s attention. He documented the transgression in a grainy picture of his own posted online that shows a woman gazing out at the ocean in a blue bathing suit, hands held above her head.\n\nNEW: Woman banned for life from Royal Caribbean cruises after taking dangerous selfiehttps://t.co/YMcPvdvskj \u2014 News Breaking LIVE (@NewsBreaking) October 19, 2019\n\nRoyal Caribbean warns against \u201cunsafe behavior\u201d in its guest conduct policy, saying that \u201csitting, standing, laying or climbing on, over or across any exterior or interior railings or other protective barriers\u201d is forbidden.\n\nThe company also lays out consequences for violations, though its policy makes no mention of lifetime bans. Guests kicked off a ship have to pay their own way home, the rules state.\n\nMany companies, tourist sites and government agencies have tried to curb dangerous photography, declaring \u201cno selfie zones\u201d and launching public awareness campaigns. The National Park Service has put out a guide to taking pictures, while Yellowstone National Park asks people to pledge they will not compromise their safety or their surroundings for a shot.\n\n\u201cNo picture is worth hurting yourself, others, or the park,\u201d Yellowstone\u2019s website says.\n\nSeveral years ago, Disneyland banned selfie sticks, lamenting that they had \u201cbecome a growing safety concern for both our guests and cast.\u201d The announcement came days after a roller coaster shut down mid-ride due to a woman\u2019s selfie attempt.\n\nThe consequences of an ill-conceived photo can be dire. Last year, researchers tallied 259 people who died while taking selfies over a six-year period. Causes of death ranged from drowning to falling to electrocution, their study said, and victims tended to be young.\n\n\u201cThe selfie deaths have become a major public health problem,\u201d lead author Agam Bansal told The Washington Post.\n\nBut some travelers are not swayed by all the warnings. Under fire last month for broadcasting a precarious-looking photo stunt to their 100,000-plus Instagram followers, one \u201cinfluencer\u201d couple dismissed concerns: \u201cWe have never put ourselves in danger for our photos and we never will,\u201d they told Fox News.\n\nRead more:\n\nA checklist for taking safe selfies\n\nBison selfies are a bad idea: Tourist gored in Yellowstone as another photo goes awry\n\n\u2018At a certain point, you just lose it:\u2019 Passengers revolt and riot aboard Norwegian Spirit cruise ship", "description": "Stories abound of tourists dangerously eager for the perfect photograph \u2014 and a group that caters to travelers has had enough.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "October At Am", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
