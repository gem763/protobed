As a child, I didn\u2019t question this, but now that I\u2019ve reached legal adulthood in Japan, the government sends me free vouchers every year to get tested for cancers of the reproductive system. The first time I was tested for cancer, it was at a large and reputable hospital in Tokyo, and I was told that no female gynecologists were present that day. Bad luck. But when I went back recently for a second time, I decided to check ahead on the hospital website to see if I\u2019d at least have a chance of being seen by a female doctor. To my horror, there are currently no female gynecologists working at that hospital, which also happens to have a famous birthing center. Making matters worse is the medical school admissions scandal from a few years ago, where it was found that female applicants\u2019 scores were lowered so that more men could be admitted.\u201d", "description": "The Lily asked young women in America and abroad: What\u2019s college like these days?", "authors": ["Nneka Mcguire"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DENkJB6gD4Z5jjpl4R-0IG1aOc4=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KS2P5ADLENBXXJAV5MVSP6V5H4.jpg"}
