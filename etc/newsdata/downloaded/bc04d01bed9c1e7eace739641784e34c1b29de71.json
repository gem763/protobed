Jeon Heon-kyun/Pool via REUTERS\n\nSouth Korea showcased newly acquired F-35 stealth fighter jets to mark Armed Forces Day as Moon tried to allay concerns that his policy of engagement with neighboring North Korea would weaken the South\u2019s commitment to defense.\n\nHe said the F-15K jets patrolled the disputed islets called Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, which are controlled by Seoul and claimed by both countries, a move that could inflame already strained ties between the two.\n\n\u201cJust a moment ago, the F-15K, the most powerful fighter-bomber in Northeast Asia, has returned from completing a patrol mission over our land Dokdo... without any problems,\u201d Moon told the military in a speech.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s defense ministry clarified that two of the four jets participating in the patrol flew over the islands.\n\nJapan strongly protested the flight, one of its foreign ministry officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe islands belong to Japan historically and under international law and the patrol was unacceptable and deplorable, the official added, saying Japan had previously asked Seoul not to conduct the flights.\n\nOn Friday, South Korean officials had protested over Tokyo\u2019s annual defense review that referred to Japan owning the islands. The foreign ministry summoned a military official at the Japanese embassy in Seoul to demand an immediate retraction.\n\nThe neighbors have been locked in a worsening diplomatic and trade row rooted in wartime history and disagreements over compensation for forced laborers during Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 occupation of Korea.\n\nAfter Japan tightened curbs on exports of high-tech materials vital to South Korea\u2019s chip and display industries in July, each has stripped the other of fast-track trade status.\n\nIn addition, South Korea decided in August to terminate an intelligence-sharing pact with its neighbor.\n\nOnly when Japan\u2019s \u201cunfair export control measures are resolved\u201d will South Korea consider renewing the pact, foreign ministry spokesman Kim In-chul told a news briefing on Tuesday.\n\nIn July, a Russian military aircraft twice violated airspace over the disputed islands and drew hundreds of warning shots from South Korean jets, South Korean officials said, during what Russia said was a long-range joint air patrol with China.\n\nJapan, which said it also scrambled fighter aircraft at the time, lodged a complaint with both South Korea and Russia over the incident.\n\nThe islands had 28 South Korean residents as of Tuesday, according to South Korean police.\n\nF-35 DELIVERIES\n\nMoon marked Armed Forces Day at a ceremony at an airbase in the city of Daegu where four of the eight Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) F-35A jets delivered this year were displayed. Forty of the aircraft are to be delivered by 2021.\n\nHe made no direction mention of Japan, or North Korea, in his address, but said today\u2019s security climate was highly unpredictable, requiring strength as well as innovation.\n\n\u201cAs the recent drone attack in the Middle East demonstrated to the world, the challenges we will face will be entirely different from those of the past,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Korea has criticized the South\u2019s weapons procurements and its joint military drills with the U.S. military as undisguised preparations for war that are forcing it to develop new short-range missiles.\n\nMoon has thrown his support behind talks to end the North\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, urging that working-level negotiations between the North and the United States be held soon. No new dates or locations have been set.\n\nAnalysts have said the F-35 stealth jets put North Korea\u2019s anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems in a vulnerable position.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n(Graphic: Map of disputed islands Dokdo/Takeshima, here)", "description": "South Korean fighter jets flew a patrol on Tuesday over islands at the center of a bitter dispute with Japan, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said at an event marking the founding of his nation's military, prompting a protest from Tokyo.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435757289&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901X2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
