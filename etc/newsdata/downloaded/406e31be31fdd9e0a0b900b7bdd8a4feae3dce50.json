(AP) - John Johnson has interceptions in consecutive games for the Los Angeles Rams, including the clinching pick in the end zone on fourth down against Cleveland on Sunday.\n\nThe third-year safety intercepted a pass by Drew Brees in overtime of the NFC championship game to help send the Rams to the Super Bowl last season.\n\nHowever, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said some of the biggest plays Johnson makes are the ones that barely get noticed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a knack for making big plays, but I think the great thing about him is he\u2019s an outstanding tackler,\u201d Phillips said Thursday. \u201cHe is an outstanding open-field tackler. He makes a lot of tackles that could have gone for more yards if we had a lesser guy.\u201d\n\nJohnson has emerged as a key figure in a secondary that is not allowing explosive pass plays. Los Angeles has not allowed a reception longer than 30 yards through three games, and the longest catch by a wide receiver is 28 yards despite facing elite players such as Michael Thomas of New Orleans and the Browns\u2019 duo of Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landy.\n\nPhillips said being able to prevent yards after the catch in the open field is a main reason why the pass defense has been so effective, crediting the trio of safeties in Johnson, Eric Weddle and rookie Taylor Rapp for their part in cutting out big gains.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to throw the ball and catch the ball on you no matter what, so you got to make the play when the ball is thrown down the field,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cMake the tackle at eight yards instead of 15 or 20 or 25, whatever. We ask for good tacklers on defense.\u201d\n\nJohnson has 26 tackles, tied with middle linebacker Cory Littleton for the team lead, and his 12 solo tackles are second to Littleton\u2019s 16.\n\nDespite Phillips\u2019 praise for his tackling, Johnson said it was not something that came naturally. The improvement began during his junior season at Boston College as Johnson got better at using his eyes to figure out where to tackle ballcarriers and determining closing angles.\n\nEven with that growth continuing during his senior season and into the NFL, Johnson said tackling is still \u201cone of the hardest things in football\u201d and considers himself merely solid.\n\nCornerback Aqib Talib thinks Johnson is underselling himself.\n\n\u201cHonestly, me and MP (Marcus Peters) talk about his tackling all the time,\u201d Talib said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best tackling guys who I have played with, period. Whether it\u2019s close-quarter tackles, wrap tackles, whatever, he\u2019s a great tackler and that\u2019s one of his best attributes.\u201d\n\nBut those traits will be tested this week by Tampa Bay\u2019s offense, which had four pass plays of 30 or more yards in the 32-31 loss to the New York Giants in Week 3. The biggest challenge will come from wide receiver Mike Evans, who already has catches of 41, 55, and 44 yards this season.\n\n\u201cYou see the production, he\u2019s in elite company,\u201d coach Sean McVay said. \u201cI want to say that Randy Moss and A.J. Green are the only other guys to be able to do what Mike Evans has done in the first five years of his career in terms of the production, so he\u2019s a great player. Somebody we got to be aware of, and it\u2019s a great challenge.\u201d\n\nRams defensive backs understand the importance of not giving up chunk plays to Evans, but the presence of the steady Johnson seems to be giving them time to engage other high-profile receivers this week.\n\nWeddle had a back and forth exchange on Twitter with Antonio Brown on Thursday, writing that the game \u201cNever was and never will be\u201d about the former New England wideout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just worried about Tampa, so I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s got everyone in a ruckus,\u201d Weddle joked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the past,\u201d Weddle said. \u201cI said what I said, he said what he said. It\u2019s not worth talking about it because he\u2019s not my teammate. He doesn\u2019t play in the league, so there\u2019s really no point.\u201d\n\nNOTES: TE Tyler Higbee (chest) and RG Austin Blythe (ankle) are \u201con pace\u201d to play against Tampa Bay, McVay said. Higbee and Blythe were full participants in practice. \u2026 DE Michael Brockers did not practice because of illness, but McVay did not believe it would keep him from playing on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Johnson has interceptions in consecutive games for the Los Angeles Rams, including the clinching pick in the end zone on fourth down against Cleveland on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Greenspan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/saints_rams_football_42090_c0-151-3619-2261_s1770x1032.jpg?3009c2bb47656f4d34f612e5023a6274a8267c55", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
