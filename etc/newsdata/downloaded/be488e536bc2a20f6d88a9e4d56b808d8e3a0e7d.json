Haven\u2019t we seen this before?\u201d\n\nWhen the Brexit referendum was held in 2016, continental Europe was shocked, and afraid Brexit might bring down Europe. If a country could just leave, the thinking went, what was stopping others who were frustrated with the EU\u2019s rules and regulations from simply walking away, too? Then, in the ensuing years, especially after the failures of former Prime Minister Theresa May, its attitude toward Brexit shifted\u2014from fear for itself to concern for Britain. The Brexit vote \u201cwas a big scare for Europe,\u201d Pierre Haski, a foreign-affairs commentator for France Inter radio, told me. \u201cAnd we went from that to \u2018Pity the British.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen France\u2019s \u201cyellow vest\u201d movement emerged last fall, it revealed a divide in the country between rural and urban, and a groundswell of discontent. President Emmanuel Macron has been able to, at least so far, harness that into a national debate rather than a perilous one-issue referendum. Elsewhere, such as Italy, far-right parties that once advocated leaving the euro have softened their rhetoric, content to gut the EU from within, wary of a backlash from a public that has watched chaos in Britain from afar. In Greece, which faced an actual threat of exiting the euro, the political class has been bemused by the Brexiteers\u2019 delusion that the EU would be lenient.\n\nRead: France\u2019s yellow vests are rebels without a cause\n\nThe arrival of Johnson in Downing Street has marked a turning point in how Europe views the United Kingdom. For a while, continental Europe laughed along with Johnson\u2014who was foreign secretary in the early part of May\u2019s government\u2014or rolled its eyes at his over-the-topness. That was the case as recently as late August, when Johnson, by then prime minister, met with Macron and rested his foot, rogueishly, on his coffee table, projecting an image of studied insouciance, of sticking it to the French.\n\nYet Johnson had put his foot up after Macron had, at least symbolically, put his down\u2014making clear that Europe was running low on patience and would not grant Britain more concessions, and that European officials believed it was up to Johnson to pull his socks up and present concrete proposals for how Brexit would unfold. Macron believes Brexit will weaken the U.K., leading to a \u201chistoric vassalization\u201d caught between other powers\u2014the United States, China, Europe.", "description": "Onlookers in Paris, Rome, Berlin, and elsewhere across Europe have been stupefied by the internecine battles in London.", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2NOVG/facebook.jpg?1567758763", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
