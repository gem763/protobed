One researcher estimated that it controls between 5 billion and 10 billion Libyan dinars in assets, suggesting it\u2019s worth at least a $1 billion, with tens of millions of dollars in annual revenues.\n\nThe authority\u2019s alleged funding schemes run the gamut. Properties have been taken on the grounds they are needed for reasons of national security. Businessmen are told to cough up cash. Fuel is smuggled abroad and sold.\n\nA 2017 Libyan government audit estimated the total value of fuel smuggled out of the country at $5 billion a year.\n\nWarehouses are seized from businesspeople, dismantled and sold for scrap metal, according to Predatory Economies in Eastern Libya, a report prepared in June by the organisation Global Initiative Against Transnational Crime.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And unlike public investment funds such as the Libyan Investment Authority, which manages a portfolio of properties and equities technically owned by the state, it is subject to little scrutiny.\n\nIt appears to answer only to Haftar. Its Facebook page shows photos of white-haired military officers conferring with each other. Its barebones website contains no explanation of its role, details about its holdings, or contact information.\n\nThe Independent reached out repeatedly to the fund and its spokesperson. After initially agreeing to speak with The Independent and soliciting a detailed list of questions, the spokesperson contacted through the organisation's Facebook page did not answer any any of the questions, and stopped replying to messages for more than one week before this story was published.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like to talk or share info,\u201d said one scholar who is based in Libya but asked not to be quoted by name for fear of angering the LNA. \u201cThey know how shady things look as perceived from the outside.\u201d\n\nBut the scholar also argued that some allegations against the authority were one-sided, or exaggerated. Since November, it has been reined in somewhat by civilian authorities in eastern Libya, and courts have repeatedly challenged its attempts at overreach.\n\n\u201cIn addition to some minimal predatory practices, most of its practices and business falls in line with a legal framework,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the authority tried to go rogue it didn\u2019t work out. They were being challenged. So they are now trying to make all their activities fall in line with the military investment authority legislation passed last year.\u201d\n\nIts chairman, General Mohamed Al-Madani al-Fakhri, is among Haftar\u2019s most loyal adjutants, and its board members include other senior military officers within Haftar\u2019s camp.\n\nAssets include the facilities for loading and unloading cargo at the port in Benghazi and farms, according to experts, giving it potential monopoly power over strategic levers of the economy such as imports and food production.\n\nIn recent days, the authority issued a statement taking control of entry of any foreigners into eastern Libya, a potential means of maintaining an eye on foreign businesspeople, and shaking them down.\n\n\u201cIt started with taking over buildings,\u201d said the researcher, who asked not to be named for fear of endangering his sources. \u201cToday it has become more organised. It\u2019s being accelerated by the will of the LNA to generate revenues, and the will of some commanders to make money.\u201d\n\nThe LNA's financial needs have grown in recent months. Libya\u2019s considerable oil wealth remains under the control of the Central Bank, which despite the civil war, retains its independence and continues to pay for public salaries, pensions, and fund state institutions such as hospitals. The LNA has tried repeatedly to grab control of both the Central Bank and the Libyan National Oil Company but has failed.\n\nAfter seizing control of Libya\u2019s east and south during nearly five years of on-and-off warfare, the LNA, lead by Haftar, launched an offensive to take control of the capital, Tripoli, in April.\n\nDespite promising supporters and patrons a quick victory, the conflict has now dragged on for nearly five months, and has turned into a bloody stalemate amid signs of impatience by Haftar\u2019s backers in Cairo, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThough the warlord's Arab allies have provided him with military and diplomatic support, there is little evidence they\u2019ve offered cash, leaving him to fend for himself in order to bankroll his military aspirations and rebuild eastern Libya after years of war.\n\nIn addition to paying wages for his 70,000 or so fighters, Haftar\u2019s expenses include a $2 million deal this year with a Houston-based lobbying firm to assist with its \u201cdiplomatic goals\u201d in Washington, according to US Treasury documents.\n\nExperts have described the authority as a way of giving a sheen of legality and order to alleged pillaging that was already taking place at the hands of Haftar\u2019s allies and fighters.\n\nThe fund resembles efforts by Haftar\u2019s patron and apparent role model, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, to facilitate the military\u2019s infiltration into the economy, as well as religious foundations in Iran, which have seized the homes and properties of businesspeople.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t hide that the Egyptian model is what inspires them \u2013 to make the LNA as financially independent as possible and diversify its sources of income,\u201d said the scholar.\n\nSome fear the authority foreshadows how Libya would be ruled under Haftar, who has received the implicit backing of US President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI believe it is not right,\u201d said Ahmed Sharksi, a 29-year-old activist from Benghazi now living in exile in Tunisia. \u201cWhere the military gets involved in the day-to-day running of the country, there\u2019s a lot of dissatisfaction with its actions. Any organisation which is not closely watched or monitored can get out of control.\u201d", "description": "The seaside property was located just west of Libya\u2019s number two city of Benghazi, a property development gem right on the shores of the Mediterranean that could generate riches once the north African nation\u2019s many troubles are sorted out.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/16/libya-haftar--1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
