I would never say it after a defeat.\n\n\u201cWe were punished in some defeats and I shut my mouth, I didn\u2019t say anything, so it is what it is.\u201d\n\nGuardiola, whose side host Southampton twice this week firstly in their defence of the League Cup trophy in fourth round action on Tuesday, is currently struggling with having to play players out of position.\n\nBrazilian veteran Fernandinho \u2014 who is suspended for the League Cup match \u2014 and Rodri have filled in in defence for John Stones and Argentinian Nicolas Otamendi.\n\nBoth of them are now fit but Rodri injured a hamstring last week joining the likes of Frenchman Aymeric Laporte, who is out till next year, and Ukrainian left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko, who is expected to miss six weeks, on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cFor the short term we can handle it. For a long time, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Guardiola.\n\n\u201cAnd of course against top, top, top, top teams, when you don\u2019t have players playing in their own position, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\n\u201cBut before it\u2019s going to happen I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s a disaster or what a pity.\u201d\n\npi/cw", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Pep Guardiola says he hates the word \u201ccomplain\u201d and will never lash out at his Manchester City players after a defeat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/e7a283_complain-me-pep-guardiola-hates-word-publicly-criticise-his-players-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
