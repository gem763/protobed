These included printed dresses, chunky coats and footwear from her autumn/winter 2019-2020 line.\n\nMembers of the public watch models present creations at the Alexa Chung public catwalk show during London Fashion Week in London, Britain, September 14, 2019.

Others were not fans.\n\n\u201cIt was really not inspiring,\u201d theatre producer Judith Rosenbauer said. \u201cI was hoping to see something new and fresh.\u201d\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES\n\nThe rise of social media influencers has forced the fashion industry to open up to the digital world, with many brands live-streaming shows to younger tech-savvy buyers.\n\n\u201cWith the advent of digital there has been incredible engagement from the consumer around fashion weeks,\u201d Rush said.\n\nLondon is the first of the four fashion capitals to directly invite the public to purchase show tickets, organisers say. In New York, trend followers can buy \u201cexperience\u201d packages via a concierge-like service.\n\nEndeavor Experiences offers what it calls \u201cthe official VIP experience\u201d for New York Fashion Week where guests can have hair and makeup done, eat canap\u00e9s in a lounge overlooking the runway and sit front row at certain shows.\n\n\u201cNYFW: The Experience\u201d packages vary from $500 to $2,500, said Mahmoud Youssef, president of Endeavor Experiences. Highlights this season have included top seats at The Blonds\u2019 Moulin Rouge musical extravaganza show, meeting the brand\u2019s designers and access to an after-party.\n\n\u201c(Customers) could be any consumer who has a passion for fashion. A consumer who is really passionate about a specific designer. Brands who are looking to entertain their best clients,\u201d Youssef said.\n\nEndeavor Experiences has worked with brands Rag and Bone and Chromat and hopes even more designers will sign up and offer access to their shows next year.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nThough its Fashion Week is smaller, London hosts brands like Burberry and Victoria Beckham and is known for emerging talent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good thing to see. London is always the avant guard of trends,\u201d said Alice Ferraz, of F*hits, a platform for digital influencers. \u201cThese shows have to be for the public, not just for the press.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.7997 pounds)", "description": "South African accountant Shaista Hamdulay never imagined she would one day mingle with fashionistas at London Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429810467&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0GX", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
