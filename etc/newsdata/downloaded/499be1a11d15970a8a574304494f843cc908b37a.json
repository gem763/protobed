Hong Kong police launched tear gas at protesters Sunday after a massive pro-democracy march continued late into the evening.\n\nLike many Americans, Perth Tolle has watched the recent protests in Hong Kong with dismay. Tolle, who divided her childhood between Texas and mainland China, spent a year in Hong Kong after college. That year, she made friends with a Chinese woman, a relationship that helped Tolle realize just how lucky she\u2019d been to spend so much of her childhood in a free country.\n\n\u201cBecause of the one-child policy, she did not exist on paper, she had no birth certificate, no social benefits, no registration to receive official documents,\u201d Tolle said. \u201cThat made me realize that governance and policies matter. This policy changed the culture, society, and economy of an entire generation in China. It made me realize freedom has an impact.\u201d\n\nBack in the U.S. and settling into a job as a financial adviser at Fidelity Investments, Tolle wanted to do something about her ideas. Even as she learned about investing in \u201cemerging markets,\u201d she chafed at sending dollars to China.\n\n\u201cEventually the idea came to me: I want to invest in free countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s freedom that allows the emerging markets of yesterday to become the developed markets of today.\u201d\n\nNow, nearly two decades later, Tolle\u2019s passion is an investable idea. In May, a company she founded, Life + Liberty Indexes, launched an exchange-traded fund to allow anyone access to its strategy: \u201cHuman and economic freedom metrics as primary factors in the investment selection process.\u201d\n\nAt at time when human freedoms seem to be on the retreat, including protests in Hong Kong and Russia, among them and societies are becoming less open, investing in the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF may be the ultimate example of trying to do well financially by doing good.\n\nPerth Tolle Perth Tolle\n\nLike most ETFs, this one FRDM, +0.34% tracks an index. It\u2019s called Life + Liberty Freedom 100 Emerging Markets Index, and Tolle developed it using data from a few sources, including the Fraser Institute, the Cato Institute and the Germany-based Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom. Its benchmark is the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s freedom that allows the emerging markets of yesterday to become the developed markets of today.\u2019 Perth Tolle\n\nRight now, the index has by far the most exposure to Taiwan, which makes up nearly one-quarter of its holdings. Securities in South Korea, Poland and Chile are right behind, with about 15%-17% exposure each. According to the Life + Liberty strategy, it\u2019s how free a country is, rather than its market size, that determines how much of the index it makes up.\n\nTolle is pragmatic when asked how she\u2019d define success for the ETF. So far it\u2019s gathered enough assets to be \u201cpast the risk of closure.\u201d But it will take more inflows to become profitable \u2013 about $50 million is the usual industry benchmark, and the fund currently has about $12 million. And in its short lifespan of about three months, it\u2019s gained about 3%, according to Alpha Architect, the fund issuer.\n\nLife + Liberty is also similar to other ETFs in that it \u201crebalances\u201d every so often \u2014 in this case, once a year \u2014 based on what\u2019s going on in the world.\n\n\u201cThings can change both very slowly and very quickly,\u201d Tolle said. \u201cThe top four have always been the top four. The bottom holdings change faster.\u201d The index methodology has one important rule: if a country\u2019s freedom ranking declines too quickly, it will be removed from the index. In the index\u2019s short life, that\u2019s already happened once: in 2018 Turkey\u2019s freedom measurements took such a steep nose-dive in the aftermath of a failed coup that the country was booted.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the long run there is alpha,\u201d Tolle said \u2014 that is, better performance, adjusted for risk \u2014 \u201cbecause there\u2019s more sustainable growth, more resilience. [Freer countries] use their human and economic capital more efficiently.\u201d\n\nRelated: A China skeptic takes a victory lap as unwanted steel floods the market\n\nTanja Por\u010dnik is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute and, in Tolle\u2019s words, the \u201cbrains behind the data\u201d that feeds the index. Fraser and Cato have jointly produced an annual \u201cEconomic Freedom of the World\u201d report since the late 1990s.\n\nWith so much history, it\u2019s possible to evaluate how earlier assessments of freedom have played out over time, Por\u010dnik pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s striking how accurate they were in their assessment of these relationships \u2014 what leads to what, what kind of impact freedom has on the well-being of the people \u2014 per capita income but also child mortality, literacy rates, and so on. Our index confirms what was said decades ago,\u201d she said.\n\nRecent research from the Global Impact Investing Network, a global industry group of sorts for the impact investing world, shows that as of 2018, there were over 1,300 organizations around the world with about $502 billion in impact investment assets, which they define as investments \u201cmade with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.\u201d\n\nThat may sound intuitive, but it actually represents an evolution from the contours of socially conscious investing a few decades ago, GIIN CEO Amit Bouri notes. Early efforts at responsible investing were mostly a bit like the Hippocratic Oath, Bouri told MarketWatch: Do no harm. Think of stakeholders trying to get investment managers to avoid certain types of companies, like tobacco or guns.\n\nIn contrast, Bouri said, \u201can impact investor would be looking at, how do I positively invest in things that contribute to a sustainable impact in the future?\u201d Of course, in impact investing, perhaps more than in most corners of the financial markets, the details become exceedingly devilish. \u201cThe question to be asked is, what is the positive and measurable impact they want to achieve?\u201d Bouri said.\n\nSee: All that glitters might be just what your portfolio needs now\n\nEric Hsueh, director and investment manager of research at Cornerstone Capital Group, an impact investing advisory, cautioned that an investor buying into FRDM needs to have \u201ceyes wide open\u201d because it is so different than most investment vehicles, primarily because it avoids China exposure.\n\nIn addition, Hsueh pointed out, information technology and financials make up close to half of the Freedom 100, compared to about 35% of the benchmark. \u201cThat could make it more volatile,\u201d he said. Still, as far as an investment play that promotes human rights, it\u2019s \u201cone of the only options. If you prioritize life and liberty and countries that are free I think this is the perfect vehicle to get exposure.\u201d\n\nTolle argues that FRDM is a strong investment option in and of itself \u2013 a diversified, broad emerging-market play \u2013 as well as a moral choice. \u201cYou should be proud that your investment dollars are not going to authoritarian regimes or places that don\u2019t support human rights. You\u2019re supporting the protection of individual rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom is on the decline,\u201d Tolle said several times in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nBut she believes it\u2019s important to look beyond the past few years for some context. Over several decades, \u201cwe have been on the march towards more freedom. There are ebbs and flows, but the long term trajectory is towards a freer world. Think of the stock market, longer term trends versus short term volatility. I think China will eventually adopt the Hong Kong model and be on the right side of history, and I look forward to the day they are included in the index.\u201d\n\nRead: Tired of market turbulence?
