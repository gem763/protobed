The improvement in morphology - the size and shape of the sperm - was dramatic.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nStudy co-author Dr Liz Williams, a specialist in human nutrition at the University of Sheffield, said while she was \"surprised\" by the improvements in the sperm quality in the experiments, further research is needed with a larger study sample.\n\nDr Williams added: \"This was a small study and we do need to repeat the work in bigger trials, but the results are very encouraging.\n\n\"The next step is to repeat the exercise in men with fertility problems and see if LactoLycopene can increase sperm quality for those men and whether it helps couples conceive and avoid invasive fertility treatments.\"\n\nProf Pacey said the work, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, did not investigate how lycopene helped boost overall sperm quality but believes the compound's antioxidant properties could be preventing sperm from becoming damaged.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nCommenting on the research, Sheena Lewis, emeritus professor of reproductive medicine at Queen's University Belfast, who was not involved in the study, said: \"This is a small study where the volunteers were healthy, not infertile, with sperm parameters close to normal.\n\n\"Hence it is difficult to extrapolate any lycopene benefits to infertile men with poor semen quality. There are no clinical outcomes to the study.\"\n\nYing Cheong, professor of reproductive medicine at University of Southampton, said: \"This study, undoubtedly, will add to our current knowledge of yet another antioxidant type supplement on sperm parameters, but what the study fails to tell us is if taking LactoLycopene supplements improves fertility, that is, the chance of actually having a successful pregnancy.\n\n\"It would be more impactful if the authors could use live birth as the end point.\"", "description": "Lycopene - a pigment that gives tomatoes their red colour - has been shown to boost overall sperm quality with improvements to their size and shape and swimming capabilities", "authors": ["Nilima Marshall", "Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13938751.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/6_Sperm-fertilising-egg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
