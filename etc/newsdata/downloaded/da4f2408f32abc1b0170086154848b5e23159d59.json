CORSIA, which is due take effect in 2021 on a voluntary basis, airlines would purchase carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world if their emissions exceed agreed targets.\n\nBut representatives from China and India, along with Russia, argued that the CORSIA plan and the agency's separate efforts to come up with a long-term target would create an unfair burden on emerging and developing countries.\n\nChina - once an important early supporter of the 2016 U.N. plan - joined Russia ahead of the assembly in arguing CORSIA unfairly penalizes developing countries because it raises costs. have urged ICAO to commit now to setting longer-term goals to reduce emissions at its 2022 assembly.\n\nAnnie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF (PA: )), said \"civil society will be watching to see that all airlines implement CORSIA with integrity.\"\n\nThe United States supports CORSIA even though U.S. President Donald Trump intends to pull the country out of a separate international agreement, the Paris climate protection deal that aims to reduce carbon emissions. Under the terms of the pact, that cannot formally happen before Nov. 4, 2020.", "description": "U.N. agency weighs options for long-term plane emissions goal, faces China pushback", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
