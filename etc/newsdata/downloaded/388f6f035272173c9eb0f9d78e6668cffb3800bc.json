Resolutions have no legal weight.\n\nWilliam A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA, said Tuesday the memo is a \u201cclear concession\u201d to a lawsuit filed in federal court against the city in response to the resolution. He called the memo a positive development but said the NRA will not withdraw its lawsuit until the resolution is formally revoked.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco publicly, officially maligned law-abiding NRA members as terrorists and publicly, officially vowed to blacklist them from government work,\u201d he said.\n\nCity officials, however, say the organization is misinterpreting what the resolution does and is inaccurate in describing the memo as any kind of retreat.\n\nJohn Cote, spokesman for the city attorney\u2019s office, said the resolution was never intended to change any laws.\n\n\u201cIf the NRA thinks this is a win, it\u2019s only because their lawsuit completely distorts what the resolution actually does,\u201d he said.\n\nThe resolution approved by the Board of Supervisors contends that the gun-rights lobby uses its wealth and organizational strength to incite gun owners \u201cto acts of violence.\u201d It also states that San Francisco \u201cshould take every reasonable step\u201d to assess ties between its contractors and the NRA.\n\nThe NRA sued San Francisco in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , saying that officials are violating the group\u2019s free speech rights for political reasons and that the city is seeking to blacklist anyone associated with the NRA.\n\nSupervisor Catherine Stefani drafted the resolution after a shooter opened fire at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy, killing three people and wounding more before taking his own life.\n\nShe said Tuesday that the resolution did not direct the city to assess contracting practices.\n\n\u201cWe made our point: the NRA is a terrorist organization. I will keep fighting them using every tool at my disposal,\u201d Stefani said.\n\nThe memo by the mayor states that until the board approves an ordinance, \u201cno department will take steps to assess the relationships between city contractors and the NRA,\u201d or will departments restrict a contractor from doing business with the NRA.\n\nThe mayor also said she takes seriously the board\u2019s statements on the impact of gun violence and the role of the NRA\u2019s leadership, and will work with supervisors to address the \u201cepidemic of gun violence.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "San Francisco's mayor has told department heads they cannot investigate the possible ties of city contractors to the National Rifle Association, prompting the gun-rights group to declare victory in its ongoing fight with the liberal city.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Har"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/nra_vs_san_francisco_52281_c17-0-3249-1885_s1770x1032.jpg?d25677991c0b0ebd98758d2d21031e672d2d1408", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
