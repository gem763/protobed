REUTERS/Mike Hutchings\n\nThe Information Ministry said the men were taken into custody after 15 months of surveillance during which they tried to obtain weapons from military personnel and secure funding \u201cfor the purpose of taking over the reins of government\u201d.\n\nIts statement said one of the suspects, acting on behalf of the alleged ringleader, had contacted a number of serving military personnel about the plot.\n\nIt was not clear how advanced any threat was, or whether the suspects were known to authorities, although one was identified as a Ghanaian weapons manufacturer.\n\nThe ministry could not be reached for further comment.\n\n\u201cThe joint operation was to neutralise an elaborate plot targeted at the presidency, and with the ultimate aim of destabilising the country,\u201d the statement issued on Monday said.\n\nIt said the suspects were part of a group pretending to work on education, health and homelessness to radicalise young people.\n\nThe ministry published a list of the weapons retrieved during the operation, including 22 improvised explosive devices, six pistols, a long knife, three smoke grenades, seven mobile phones and three laptops.\n\nUnrest is rare in Ghana, a country that prides itself on its ability to resolve political and social tensions peacefully, in contrast to some of its West African neighbours.\n\nIt has seen five constitutional transfers of power since its last coup in 1981.
