Lindsey Graham. Critics called it a betrayal, and warned that fighting in the area could allow ISIS to regroup. The Kurds have been holding a large number of captured ISIS fighters, who could escape in the chaos (something Trump said wasn\u2019t a concern to America, since he assumed most of them would go to Europe).\n\n\u201cYou are giving a rope of survival to this group that you just defeated,\u201d Ishak said.\n\nRev. Pat Robertson in 2015. (Photo: Steve Helber/AP) More\n\nBut evangelicals were particularly outraged. Others besides Robertson who expressed dismay at the move included Mike Huckabee who tweeted, \u201cI generally support @POTUS on foreign policy & don\u2019t want our troops fighting other nations\u2019 wars, but a HUGE mistake to abandon Kurds. They\u2019ve never asked us to do THEIR fighting-just give them tools to defend themselves. They have been faithful allies. We CANNOT abandon them.\u201d\n\nAmong prominent Christian evangelical leaders Jerry Falwell Jr. and Robert Jeffress were almost alone in backing Trump\u2019s move.\n\nAt first glance, Christian evangelicals wouldn\u2019t seem to have a direct stake in the issue. The Kurds, an ethnic group in a region that encompasses parts of Iraq, Syria and Turkey, are primarily Muslim. There is a considerable Christian population in the affected area of northeast Syria \u2014 estimated at around 40,000 by Peter Burns of the Washington-based In Defense of Christians, including members of the Syriac Orthodox church, the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East \u2014 but not much evangelical presence either in established congregations or as missionaries.\n\nBut there are larger geopolitical issues in play. Turkey\u2019s fraught relationship with the Kurds has long been a source of tension with the U.S. There are around 35 million Kurds spread across the Middle East, a third of them in Turkey. Their long struggle to establish a national state would threaten Turkish sovereignty over a considerable swath of territory, and Turkey considers their formidable guerrilla army terrorists.", "description": "Trump\u2019s decision on Syria, reversing a long-standing American commitment to protect the Kurds, who for the last five years have borne the brunt of the fighting against the Islamic militants of ISIS, drew widespread condemnation across the political spectrum, including from such close political allies", "authors": ["Jerry Adler", "Caitlin Dickson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vnoXx9Nm5Ejhqmmqg9b57A--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/302b3eb0-ebb1-11e9-bfae-5ee1882a0f9a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
