He has \u2018called off\u2019 the talks and asserted that a planned secret meeting between him and Taliban leaders at Camp David, set for Sunday just days before the 9/11 anniversary, is now canceled. Some question whether it was a face-saving attempt after the deal his envoy said had been reached \u2018in principle\u2019 faced serious challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban took half a day to respond, saying the abrupt decision hurt U.S. credibility after they had \u2018finalized\u2019 a deal, but said the U.S. likely would return to negotiations. The two sides had still been talking on Saturday, they said \u2014 two days after Trump said he had \u2018immediately\u2019 called off talks.\u201d AP\n\nTHE BACKSTORY -- NYT\u2019S MUJIB MASHAL in Kabul: \u201cTaliban Talks Hit a Wall Over Deeper Disagreements, Officials Say\u201d: \u201cEven as President Trump blamed a recent Taliban attack for his decision to call off nearly year-long negotiations with the insurgents, officials suggested on Sunday it had more to do with the Taliban\u2019s resistance to the American terms for a peace deal. Talks that once seemed on the verge of a breakthrough had hit a wall over how the deal should be finalized and announced, they said.\n\n\u201cWith the president himself showing more engagement in the talks in recent weeks, the Trump administration had set in motion a daring gambit: Fly the insurgents\u2019 leaders and the Afghan leader, Ashraf Ghani, to American soil. At Camp David, the traditional retreat of many presidents, separate meetings with each side would then lead to a grand announcement by Mr. Trump, according to Afghan, Western and Taliban officials with knowledge of the peace talks.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban leaders, however, having refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government until after the group had an agreement with the United States, had compared the proposal to the Americans\u2019 tricking them into political suicide. The Americans were also rushing to finalize outstanding issues, including disagreements over prisoner release, before the meeting at Camp David.\u201d NYT\n\nSUNDAY BEST, POMPEO EDITION -- CHUCK TODD spoke with SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO on NBC NEWS\u2019 \u201cMEET THE PRESS\u201d: TODD: \u201cDoes this mean talks are off completely?\u201d POMPEO: \u201cSo, for the time being that is absolutely the case. We\u2019ve recalled Ambassador Khalilzad back to Washington.\u201d\n\nTODD: \u201cLook, I know you're not a big fan of timetables. Nobody in these positions ever is, but does this mean the likelihood of withdrawing from Afghanistan now has been extended, that isn't it going to happen in the next year or the next two years, that we may be looking at much farther down the road?\u201d\n\nPOMPEO: \u201cChuck, I, I hope not. I've tried to answer each of your questions. You're right. Timetables are, are difficult things to know. I hope not. I hope we can begin inter-Afghan negotiations. I hope we can reduce the levels of violence. I hope the Taliban will continue to move towards their commitment to break with Al Qaeda. If we can do that, I hope that we can reduce our cost in blood and treasure there in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n-- ON WHETHER HE\u2019LL RUN FOR SENATE \u2026 HE DIDN\u2019T SAY \u2018NO\u2019!: TODD: \u201cWell, Mr. Secretary, it sounds like if you won't say you won't be on a ballot November 2020, the Kansas Senate questions don't go away. POMPEO: \u201cThey're going to go away. The clock continues to run. I think the American people should know their Secretary of State thinks about one and one thing only: protecting America's national security interests.\u201d\n\n-- JAKE TAPPER interviewed Pompeo on CNN\u2019S \u201cSTATE OF THE UNION\u201d: TAPPER: \u201cIt was just a few weeks ago that the Taliban put out a video in which they supported the 9/11 attacks -- reiterating their support for the 9/11 attacks, blaming it -- blaming the 9/11 attacks on the United States and foreign policy. I guess the question would be here is an organization that still supports 9/11, still believes that the United States was to blame. We brought that on ourselves. Why bring people like that to Camp David? I understand why you want to negotiate for peace, but why bring people like that to Camp David?\u201d\n\nPOMPEO: \u201cWe have an obligation to do everything we can to protect those men and women and takedown that risk. That\u2019s what President Trump was aiming to do. We understand who the Taliban are. There\u2019s no more clear-eyed administration. When I was the director of the CIA, I had young men and women serving in Afghanistan taking enormous risks to their lives and we\u2019re aiming to get this right. We\u2019re working to talk with those leaders that could actually deliver on these outcomes. That\u2019s what President Trump and I are both focused on and we\u2019re going to keep driving towards that outcome. \u201c\n\n-- GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS also spoke with Pompeo on ABC NEWS\u2019 \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d: STEPHANOPOULOS: \u201cDoes this collapse put any U.S. pullout on hold?\u201d POMPEO: \u201cThe president hasn't yet made a decision on that. We'll be talking about that in the coming days.\u201d\n\n-- CHRIS WALLACE also interviewed Pompeo on \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY\u201d: POMPEO on the talks: \u201cI hope we get \u2019em started back,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIt will ultimately be up to the Taliban. They have got to demonstrate that they\u2019re prepared to do the things that we asked them to do in the course of those negotiations.\u201d More from Victoria Guida\n\n\n\nA message from The Boeing Company: By investing $300M in our employees in recent years, Boeing is committed to preparing the next generation of innovators through access to online learning and more.

Imports of American goods tumbled 22% in August from a year earlier to $10.3 billion, customs data showed Sunday. Exports to the United States, China\u2019s biggest market, sank 16% to $44.4 billion.\u201d AP\n\n-- \u201cManufacturers Cut Spending as Trade War Dents Confidence,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Austen Hufford: \u201cU.S. manufacturers are investing less in their factories and workforces as the trade dispute with China makes it more difficult for executives to anticipate costs and demand. The shifting contours of the tariffs that the U.S. and China have applied to each other\u2019s goods are prompting some companies to put business plans on hold. Others are cutting back investments as trade volumes and economic growth slow around the world.\n\n\u201cThese companies are buying fewer machines for their factory floors and shortening shifts. The knock-on effect means lower sales for those suppliers and less pay for workers, contributing to slower U.S. economic growth.\u201d WSJ\n\nDRIP, DRIP, DRIP \u2026 MORE ALABAMA MAP FALLOUT -- \u201cNOAA staff warned in Sept. 1 directive against contradicting Trump,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Andrew Freedman, Colby Itkowitz and Jason Samenow: \u201cNearly a week before the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publicly backed President Trump over its own scientists, a top NOAA official warned its staff against contradicting the president.\n\n\u201cIn an agencywide directive sent Sept. 1 to National Weather Service personnel, hours after Trump asserted, with no evidence, that Alabama \u2018would most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated,\u2019 staff was told to \u2018only stick with official National Hurricane Center forecasts if questions arise from some national level social media posts which hit the news this afternoon.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey were also told not to \u2018provide any opinion,\u2019 according to a copy of the email obtained by The Washington Post.\u201d WaPo\n\n\n\nA message from The Boeing Company:\n\nON THE BORDER -- \u201cTrump\u2019s plan to stem border crossings gets results,\u201d by Ted Hesson: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s plan to force Mexico to stem the flow of migrants across the southwest border of the U.S. appears to be working.\n\n\u201cBorder arrests, a metric for illegal crossings, plummeted to 51,000 in August, according to preliminary government figures obtained by POLITICO Wednesday, down more than 60 percent since a peak in May. And border watchers say it\u2019s largely because of an agreement Trump struck with Mexico in June. Mexican authorities, backed by the newly formed National Guard, are now cracking down on migrants traversing Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala, monitoring river crossings and stopping buses carrying migrants from Central America through Mexico. At the same time, the U.S. is making tens of thousands of asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their applications are considered.\n\n\u201cThe decline in border traffic \u2014 if sustained \u2014 could amount to a major victory for Trump as he heads into the 2020 election. Perhaps more important, the experimental measures taken by his administration could reshape immigration enforcement for years to come.\u201d POLITICO\n\nMEANWHILE \u2026 \u201cDems eye payback against Trump\u2019s immigration tactics,\u201d by Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle: \u201cDemocrats say they\u2019re no longer willing to throw cash to President Donald Trump for his border demands. But they still can\u2019t escape making a deal with Trump \u2014 a scenario that could divide the caucus over exactly how far to take their fight against the president.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are preparing to rebuff Trump\u2019s requests for additional wall money this month as payback for Trump\u2019s summer of hard-line immigration moves \u2014 a position that\u2019s in contrast to the billions of dollars that Democrats have handed over for border fencing and security since the start of Trump\u2019s term, according to half a dozen lawmakers and aides.\n\n\u201cThe end result of the border wall fight, however, could be another deal with Trump that triggers a fierce backlash within the Democratic Caucus, as Pelosi and her leadership team remain wary of aggressive tactics that would catapult the government into yet another shutdown.\u201d POLITICO\n\nKENNEDY WATCH -- \u201cSuffolk/Globe poll finds Kennedy leading Markey in possible Senate primary matchup,\u201d by Boston Globe\u2019s Matt Stout\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cAnti-conservative bias?

Now the prime minister\u2019s party is gunning for his seat, with Brexit on the line,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Griff Witte in Bracknell, England: \u201cWhen Phillip Lee walked across the carpeted green aisle in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the lawmaker instantly erased British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s majority.
