But my leisure time is very limited: when I\u2019m not working or standing around in parks with my toddler, time must be split between friends, family, my partner, books, films, TV, games, the gym (lol, who am I kidding?) and anything else I might want to do.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t pay me enough to go back to being a student, but one of the few saving graces of being a young adult is that you have a lot of time for your hobbies. Why did I spend so much time binge-watching middling Netflix series? Why!?\n\nOne solution is to prioritise games that only require five or ten hours of your time, and there are plenty of those around. But if you\u2019re efficient, you don\u2019t have to miss out entirely on the huge games that everyone else seems to be playing.\n\nLike many working mothers, I have, by necessity, become frighteningly efficient. Here are some tips from the frontlines.\n\nPick one massive game\n\nWhen I was a teenager, money was my limiting factor. I could afford one game every couple of months, so it had to be a good one. Now, my limiting factor is time, which I must budget just as carefully as I budgeted my money as a kid so that I could afford a Gamecube on the day it came out.\n\nThat means I can\u2019t be getting on with games that don\u2019t respect my time, such as unnecessarily bloaty open-worlds, excessively slow-paced JRPGs or online games that involve too much grinding. Also, bouncing between a giant Assassin\u2019s Creed game and a live game like Destiny is just going to frustrate you because you feel like you are achieving nothing in either.\n\nI recommend making a careful choice and sticking to it.\n\nTake what you can get\n\nOne of the biggest mental hurdles for me is accepting that I am never going to have three uninterrupted hours to play a video game.\n\nThose Sundays when I could just sit in my pajamas and play XCOM for the entire day are officially gone, if not forever then for the foreseeable future. Now I look at my PS4 controller and think, what\u2019s the point? I\u2019ll only have to turn it off again in an hour.\n\nTake that hour. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve got now. You could finish a 60-hour game in a couple of months if you can find an hour a day, or spend two months hoping that your partner will go on a trip so you can play it for a whole weekend and get nowhere.\n\nGet a Nintendo Switch\n\nThis isn\u2019t just Nintendo fangirlism talking: the Switch lets you use time that would otherwise be dead for playing games, whether it\u2019s 20 minutes on the train, a lunch break, an hour while the baby\u2019s napping or half an hour in bed before going to sleep. I played 80 hours of Breath of the Wild on maternity leave, almost exclusively in 30-minute sessions. (It\u2019s the reason I learned to breastfeed lying down.)\n\nEven if you hate Nintendo, the Switch is now home to pretty much every significant indie of the past several years. I\u2019ve caught up on so many excellent games in the past year and spent 40 hours playing Hollow Knight, and it hasn\u2019t eaten significantly into time that I could have been spending with my family or at work.\n\nIf you have kids or live with a partner, play games with them\n\nThere is a golden period when kids are between about 3 and 10 when they may actually want to play games with you, or watch you play. (After that they\u2019ll exclusively want to play with their friends, and any game you might take an interest in is automatically boring.) Keeping to kid-friendly games does rather limit your options, of course, but if you can get them into something you want to play anyway, like Ni no Kuni 2, you\u2019re golden.\n\nThis can also be an opportunity to reconnect with series like Pok\u00e9mon that you might have played as a kid but drifted away from as an adult. I know one family with teenagers who all play Destiny together.\n\nIf your partner is into games and you can afford it, consider\u2014no matter how sad this might sound\u2014setting up a spare TV and console so you can both play your individual massive games companionably. This is how my partner and I got through all the Dark Souls games.\n\nBargain with your partner\n\nIf there\u2019s a big game that you really want to play coming up, why not valiantly volunteer to stay home once the kids are in bed for a couple of nights that week so your partner can go out with their friends? If you\u2019re extremely organised, take the kids away for a day the month before, then you can reasonably bargain for a day to yourself to play.\n\nWhat never works is rolling along as usual without making any special effort for your partner and then acting baffled when they object to you being essentially absent from their evenings because a new game has come out. If you make an effort in advance, they may be happy to give you some time to play in return.\n\nLet go of guilt\n\nOne of the things I realised on maternity leave was that making time to play games was important self-care, not some guilty pleasure.\n\nI\u2019d had a baby, not a personality transplant.\n\nIt can sometimes feel like games aren\u2019t important enough to make time for, like you should always be prioritising work or parenting or, I dunno, learning Italian. But you need time for yourself.\n\nSo go home at 5pm, or give yourself permission to spent 35 minutes with a game in the mornings rather than checking work email before you head out.\n\nI encounter so many people who say they used to love video games but just don\u2019t have space in their lives for them anymore, or who\u2019ve given up on finding time to play something like Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nIt\u2019s fine if there are other things that give you pleasure that you\u2019ve decided to do instead. But if games are something you really love, don\u2019t feel guilty about making time for them.\n\nThis article was originally published on 1/11/18.", "description": "For a lot of gamers with demanding jobs, marriages and/or families, the excitement of reading good reviews for games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey is tempered by the sinking realisation that they\u2019ll never have time to play them.
