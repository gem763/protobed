Even that famous theme music \u2013 based on Handel\u2019s Zadok the Priest \u2013 adds to its gravitas. So much history, so much quality, so much drama. We are genuinely talking about the pinnacle of sport, since it is by far the most popular sport, and a competition in it that concentrates the best talent so intensely. Except maybe too intensely.\n\nOne of the problems with the modern Champions League is we have to wait until February for all that. There is a select group of about seven to 10 modern super clubs who are so much wealthier than everyone else, hoard so much of the talent, that the group stages are just far too easy for them. It makes most of the first three months of the competition entirely predictable. In that sense, too, there\u2019s really nothing like the Champions League.\n\nIt is not just the pinnacle of football, but also the greatest illustration of the problem with its distribution of wealth. It is effectively a two-tiered competition, in a double sense. The fact those clubs are so much richer than the others means far too many of their games this side of Christmas are too easy, something that instantly changes with the sudden death of the knockout rounds. That is when there is peril, there is a set of huge fixtures that really mean something, there is consequence, and therefore exquisite excitement.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut there is also a feeling of disconnection in the group stage, too. We\u2019ll all hear the music, feel how grandiose it all is\u2026 and then watch a series of entirely predictable games, at the very least knowing they\u2019re the slow-burn set-up for something sensational later on.\n\nYours,\n\nMiguel Delaney\n\nChief football writer", "description": "In modern sport, there\u2019s really nothing like the Champions League.
