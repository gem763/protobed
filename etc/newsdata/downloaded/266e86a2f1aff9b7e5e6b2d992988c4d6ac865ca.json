The number of retrenchments remained low in Q2, while the uptick in Q3 is \"comparable\" to a year ago based on preliminary data from the Manpower Ministry, MAS said.\n\n\"The weakness in economic activity has thus far been absorbed by firms rather than passed on to the labour market,\" MAS said, noting that the slowdown in gross domestic growth (GDP) has mainly been absorbed by weaker productivity growth rather than cuts to employment.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nLooking ahead, the economic slowdown is expected to dampen hiring, although unevenly across industries.
