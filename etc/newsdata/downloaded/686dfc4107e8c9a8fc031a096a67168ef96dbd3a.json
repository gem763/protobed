and was hailed 'a hero' by fans for raising awareness.\n\nThe reality starlet, 24, was seen telling her friend Dan Edgar that she had to skip the plans they had made together for the following day as she had her cervical screening booked.\n\nShe was then seen attending the appointment, allowing the crew to film inside the consultation room, recording what was involved.\n\nCourtney was seen lying back as the nurses walked her through it, explaining how smear tests work and what they're for - to test cells for signs of cancer.\n\nCourtney underwent the procedure, which many believe to be painful and therefore off-putting.\n\nBut Chloe said, afterwards: 'It's really not that bad!'\n\nShe did, however, declare that she was going to wine and ice cream after.\n\nOne viewer tweeted: '@courtneyMgreen what a hero having her smear done on TV! Raising awareness and encouraging young women to attend their appointments is so important. Huge amount of respect for you!'\n\nAnother posted: '@courtneyMgreen @OnlyWayIsEssex Well done on flagging the importance of having smear tests and how there is nothing to be afraid of!'\n\nFollowed by: 'So much appreciation for #towie raising awareness about smear tests. It\u2019s honestly so important & girls often mistake that it\u2019s painful. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s over within seconds. There is honestly nothing for these scared women to panic about. The nurses make you feel so at ease too.'\n\nAnother posted: 'This is actually incredible. Well done @courtneyMgreen for showing how quick and easy it is. Girls, please go for your smear!!'\n\nChloe herself posted about the matter, taking to her own Twitter to write: 'To all women please book in your cervical screening it\u2019s so important and it\u2019s really not scary at all it can prevent cervical cancer I can\u2019t stress enough how important and it really isn\u2019t bad!!'\n\nShe posted a similar message to Instagram, along with a snap of the TOWIE scene, in which she looked more than happy to undergo the procedure.\n\nOther female stars have used their platform to promote having the routine check - with Michelle Keegan doing so last year.\n\nShe shared a picture of herself during the test as she urged women not to put off going for the potentially life saving check-up.\n\nThe 31-year-old actress also posted a series of Instagram videos as she admitted she was guilty of putting off the procedure herself, but wanted to show people just how quick and simple the check is.\n\nSmear tests help to prevent cervical cancer by checking the health of the entrance of the womb and detecting any abnormal cells, yet the screening rates are currently the lowest they have been for two decades as women are not attending the check ups.\n\nAddressing her 3.7 million followers in an Instagram Story, the former Coronation Street star said: 'Today I'm on the way to the doctors for a smear that I've been putting off for a quite long time now.\n\n'I think the thought of going for a smear for women puts them off more than anything. 1 in 4 women now don't turn up for their appointments apparently, so I'm going to do a video blog today to show you how simple a smear test actually is.'\n\nThe soap starlet then filmed herself filling out a quick medical form in the doctor's waiting room, before sharing a snap on the medical bed captioned: 'Here we go'.\n\nAfter the procedure, Michelle shared another video on her way home, revealing: 'Smear's been done. I was in the room five minutes, on the bed for two. It was really quick, really easy. It wasn't painful at all, just a little bit uncomfortable.\n\n'Around three and a half thousand women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year and I know it can be daunting going for a smear but these doctors and nurses do it every single day.\n\n'So ladies, I'm urging you to book in for your smear. Go and get it done and tell all your family and friends to do the same. because it is so important and it's so easy.'", "description": "She shot to fame as a contestant on ITV2's hit reality show Love Island back in 2017, as she searched for romance while donning a range of skimpy swimwear.", "authors": ["Ryan Smith For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19987114-0-image-a-157_1571655431319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
