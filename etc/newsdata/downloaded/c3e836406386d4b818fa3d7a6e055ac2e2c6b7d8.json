That pick could become a 2021 sixth-rounder if Bennett is on Dallas' 53-man roster for at least four games this season.\n\nBennett was acquired by the Patriots in March as part of a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles. He didn't play as many snaps as predicted through the Patriots' first six games. The team's depth and overall defensive scheme were among the reasons for Bennett's decreased snap count.\n\nThe 33-year-old veteran also was suspended for New England's Week 7 game against the New York Jets for conduct detrimental to the team. Bennett, in a statement to ESPN regarding his suspension, noted he had a \"philosophical disagreement\" with his position coach, Bret Bielema, that led to him being suspended.\n\nBielema was asked about that disagreement Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think the part that I love about being a defensive line coach here in New England is working with smart, tough, dependable players, and Mike was that guy,\" Bielema said. \"He was a guy that was in a role that it kind of changed every week, from that first game to last week. The part that he really continued to demonstrate was Mike is a guy that believes in himself and his abilities, and there is definitely no doubt in my mind that those will be successful for him in the future again.\"\n\nBennett played fairly well for the Patriots when he saw the field, and there's little doubt he will make a positive impact on the Cowboys defense as Dallas vies for the NFC East title.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
