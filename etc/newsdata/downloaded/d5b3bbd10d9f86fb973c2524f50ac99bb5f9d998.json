There's good reasons to think about going back to Munro; she can do more in 30 pages what most novelists can't do in an entire book.\n\n\"In the last few years I've started to ask myself why I do what I do \u2014 as someone who writes suspense novels \u2014 and so I tend to go back to Munro. I think it has to do with secrets and secret keeping, themes that come up pretty consistently many of her stories.\"\n\nElisabeth de Mariaffi's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The Newfoundland author keeps re-reading Alice Munro's collection The Progress of Love.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5317795.1570802704!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/elisabeth-de-mariaffi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
