REUTERS/Ali Hashisho\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people - defeated fighters of Islamic State and their families - are held in and around camps in the region, including 68,000 in al-Hol camp, Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East, said.\n\nThey are captured Islamic State fighters - Syrian, Iraqi, and foreigners from dozens of other countries - as well as their wives and children, under the custody of Syrian Kurdish forces since U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) took the jihadist group\u2019s last enclave. Two-thirds are children.\n\n\u201cTheir parents were either killed or wounded and they are today in a place which is really not made for kids. So you can imagine the trauma those kids have suffered, are still suffering,\u201d Carboni said a day ahead of World Mental Health Day.\n\nFew countries have seemed willing to take back their citizens, who may be hard to prosecute, and the issue has led to fierce debate in their home countries where there is little public sympathy for the families of jihadists.\n\n\u201cIt is obviously a big concern, this probable increased violence in northeast Syria because this camp is in a very fragile environment, the condition of the people in the camp is also fragile,\u201d Carboni said, referring to al-Hol.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF said Turkish warplanes struck Syria\u2019s northeast, sparking \u201chuge panic among people\u201d on Wednesday. World powers fear an incursion could open a new chapter in Syria\u2019s war and worsen regional turmoil.\n\nThe \u201cstatus quo\u201d was not an option for the 100,000, Carboni said.\n\n\u201cSo our message to all states that have citizens in those camps is take responsibility, to be courageous. Because we know it\u2019s a major political and security challenge,\u201d he said, describing the situation as \u201ccomplex\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I still believe that if you look at all the population in this camp, the situation of the Westerners is probably the easiest one to solve,\u201d Carboni said.\n\nThe ICRC has argued that states must \u2018take responsibility\u2019 by taking back citizens and their children humanely and within their legal framework, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe ICRC delivers life-saving assistance to al-Hol residents and helps run a 24-hour field hospital there, he said.\n\nAid agencies must be able to continue to deliver supplies to civilians, including the cities of Hassakeh, Raqqa and Deir al-Zor, he said.", "description": "Countries must reclaim their citizens held in camps in northeast Syria, a senior official of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told Reuters on Wednesday, as Turkish forces launched an incursion.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438945637&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981D5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
