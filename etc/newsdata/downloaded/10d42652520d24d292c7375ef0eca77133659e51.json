Women and girls mature decades before men do.'\n\nDr Teo declined to comment on the crash, via a spokeswoman.\n\nNicola Teo (pictured) attended the $25,000-a -year St Catherine's school for girls and now owns a dog-walking business\n\nNicola Teo's Toyota LandCruiser allegedly hit Jock Ross's motorbike in Lower Macdonald, north of Sydney, at 3.30pm on Wednesday. Pictured: Nicola Teo\n\nDaily Mail Australia understands Nicola Teo often takes the animals to the Hawkesbury, near where the crash happened. Pictured: Her car and some dogs in an Instagram photo\n\nHours before the crash, Miss Teo posted this photo on Instagram with the caption 'just when you thought your day couldn't get any brighter'\n\nRoss, a Glasgow-born former soldier, founded the Comancheros on the New South Wales Central Coast with four other motorcycle enthusiasts on April 15, 1966.\n\nStyled as the gang's 'supreme commander', he led them into the 1984 Milperra Massacre, in which four of his men as well as two Bandidos and a 14-year-old girl died.\n\nHe took a gunshot to the head which gave him vision loss and a brain injury - but he survived.\n\nRoss was jailed for murder in 1987 over his role instigating the massacre. He was released in 1992 after serving just five years.\n\nFollowing the Milperra Massacre, Ross, who lives in Lower Macdonald, had maintained nominal control of the Comanchero for almost 20 years until a new breed of bikie arrived.\n\nRapid recruitment of Middle Eastern members in the late 1990s was splitting the gang.\n\nBikies at the scene of the Milperra Massacre outside the Viking Tavern on Father's Day 1984\n\nWilliam George 'Jock' Ross (pictured) founded the Comanchero in New South Wales in 1966\n\nRoss was spending much of his time in retirement on the Central Coast near Mangrove Mountain when a group of the new brigade, including Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi, who was shot dead last year, drove up to visit about 2002.\n\nAccording to former detective Duncan McNab's book Outlaw Bikers in Australia, the visitors were concerned about the gang's leadership and told Ross they wanted to chat.\n\nThe new members of the Comanchero, young and fearless, respected only money and power and had no time for how the old guard - including their club's founding father - wanted things run.\n\n'Ross was unsuspecting and outnumbered and the discussion was quick and violent,' McNab wrote. 'The Comancheros, led by Mick Hawi, delivered a comprehensive beating to the much older leader.\n\n'They left him battered and took both his club colours and his Harley-Davidson. It was the outlaw equivalent of spitting in Jock's face.'\n\nRoss was about 60. Hawi was barely 21. Within a year Hawi was national president and Ross's leadership was done.\n\nSince he was ousted, Ross, a grandfather of 12, has been captain of his local Rural Fire Service.\n\nComanchero bikie gang founder Jock Ross (pictured) is fighting for life after a motorcycle crash\n\nThe Comanchero outlaw motorcycle gang was founded on principles of loyalty and respect", "description": "Nicola Teo's LandCruiser allegedly struck Jock Ross's Harley Davidson at 3.30pm in Lower MacDonald, north of Sydney, on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore", "Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/21/18983264-0-image-a-12_1569530565883.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
