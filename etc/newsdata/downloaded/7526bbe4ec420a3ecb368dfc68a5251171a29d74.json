He said: everything hurts. I asked what his name is. He told me Mohammed.\u201d\n\nConflicting reports gave the suspect\u2019s first name as Omar. Those who had rushed to help became suspicious after he shouted the word \u201cAllah\u201d and held the man until police arrived.\n\nIt later transpired he had stolen the lorry after forcing its driver from the cab while it was waiting at a red light.\n\nThe unnamed driver told of how the suspect tore open the door of the lorry and stared at him with wild eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d the driver said he asked the man. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t say a word. I asked him again, then he dragged me out of the truck.\u201d\n\nThe incident was reminiscent of the 2016 attack in Berlin which 12 people were killed when a rejected Tunisian asylum seeker drove a stolen lorry into a crowded Christmas market.\n\nThe suspect in the Limburg attack was known to police and has a criminal record, but no history of extremism.\n\nHe has been living in Germany since November 2015, but his residence papers expired at the beginning of this month.\n\n---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK---", "description": "Seven people have been injured in a suspected terror attack after a man drove a stolen lorry into a line of cars in Germany.", "authors": ["Justin Huggler"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tk3yxS37fnWgR3YJVzvJDg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/b5c6f35f9158c9c9dd814a79debcc6c8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
