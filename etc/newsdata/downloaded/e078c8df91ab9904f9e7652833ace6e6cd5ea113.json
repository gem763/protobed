If that is the best remedy the DOJ can come up with, that would be tantamount to blocking the merger.\"\n\nThe Communications Workers of America urged the Justice Department to abandon the settlement in its comments, arguing that the deal is not in the public interest.\n\nThe odds: Historically, the federal court review of a merger settlement has been an uneventful affair.\n\nBut U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon \u2014 who stymied the DOJ's attempt to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger \u2014 also raised concerns this year about the DOJ\u2019s consent decree in the CVS-Aetna merger and held a hearing before ultimately allowing it.\n\nMerger opponents are hoping the DOJ\u2019s settlement will get similar scrutiny.\n\nMeanwhile: New York is leading a coalition of 16 states and D.C. in a separate lawsuit to block the merger. The states filed a brief with the D.C. court reviewing the settlement urging the judge to hold off on a decision until the states\u2019 case plays out in New York. That case is set to go to trial in December.\n\nT-Mobile and Sprint have agreed not to close their merger until the state litigation is resolved\n\nThe state attorney general of Mississippi withdrew his opposition to the merger this week after negotiating commitments from the companies.\n\nWhat's next: The DOJ is collecting the settlement comments and will file them with the court, along with a response.", "description": "Opponents of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger are piling on the deal in the hopes of convincing a judge to block it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/jwwcCKreSGHgmrke-PkYQD0sc3Q=/0x0:1600x900/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570742366697.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
