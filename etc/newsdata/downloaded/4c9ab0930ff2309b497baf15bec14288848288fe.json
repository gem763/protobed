They are being treated by paramedics at Abel Point Marina at Airlie Beach, having been brought back to shore by a boat. The extent of their injuries is not known.\n\nQueensland Ambulance (@QldAmbulance) #Update1 - Two patients are being transported by road to a location on Proserpine Shute Harbour Road where they will meet up with the rescue helicopter. Both patients have sustained serious lower limb injuries and are in a serious condition.\n\nIt is unclear yet whether the attack occurred at a specific location where drumlines would have otherwise been used. Conservationists say there is no scientific evidence lethal baits prevent shark attacks.\n\nSeveral people were injured \u2013 and a Victorian man killed \u2013 in a series of shark attacks in the Whitsundays last summer.\n\nMore to come.", "description": "Both men are in a serious condition with lower limb injuries after they were bitten off the Whitsundays coast in Queensland", "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5217a0f0ffee59e6036a20e86262bc29e10e5777/0_167_5128_3078/master/5128.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70dcfc9b561b34c6cdcf38ec48e550d5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
