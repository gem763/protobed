He had been focused on saving money, and it had been a while since he had a good meal. So, with his first paycheck from bussing tables in hand \u2014 approximately $105 \u2014 he walked into Montecito, California, eatery.\n\n\u201cI just remember going and sitting by myself and ordering a meal, sitting in Montecito and seeing all this wealth around me,\u201d he told FOX Business in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cI was just so happy that I had just made my first check and I was just so grateful ... The possibilities are endless.\u201d\n\nThat was about 17 years ago. In 2014, Arana joined Mauricio Umansky\u2019s The Agency, which is one of the most successful real estate firms in the nation, as a principal and partner. The brokerage firm was co-founded by Umansky's father, Eduardo, as well as real estate broker and architecture specialist Billy Rose and his partner Blair Chang.\n\nNow, the 39-year-old Pacific Palisades resident is a managing partner at the agency, is the No. 7 ranked real estate broker in the nation and the No. 3 broker in California. He owes his success to his drive and his determination that led him to outwork his competitors.\n\nDuring that meal, Arana saw life from a different perspective. After moving to Santa Barbara from Bolivia at 22 years old, Arana got a job bussing tables at high-end Spanish restaurant, Cava. He barely spoke a word of English and he figured that he could quickly learn the language bussing tables.\n\n\u201cI just saw the opportunities out there that I never was exposed to,\" he said. \"And I was just so grateful to be around it and I knew that if I work hard enough, one day I was going to be able to be one of those guys sitting in there.\u201d\n\nCava is where he learned the basics of the English language, and it's where he would meet the woman he eventually married.\n\nToday, Arana is far from the person who first walked through the doors of Cava.\n\nHe\u2019s sold more than $340 million in total sales volume during of 2018, according to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Real Trends 2019 report, \u201cRanking the Top Real Estate Professionals & Teams,\u201d and he is ranked higher than any other broker working for The Agency, which ranked No. 41 of the Top 250 Real Estate Teams in terms of sales volume.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nArana was raised in Sucre, Bolivia, by his Croatian mother and his Spanish father. He went to college in Bolivia, where he studied business administration and marketing.\n\nAt 22, he had won a scholarship for a master's degree in finance, but the program was only taught in English or Hebrew \u2014 neither of which Arana spoke.\n\n\u201cAnd that's really what had gotten me to move to the United States,\u201d he told FOX Business in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview. \u201cI had an aunt that had offered for me to crash on her couch for a month, so I took the offer. I packed my suitcase and I grabbed my savings.\u201d\n\nWith only $120 in his pocket, Arana moved to Santa Barbara, where he knew no one except his aunt, whom he had met once before, and his cousins, whom he\u2019d never previously known.\n\nHe started picking up the language but soon ran out of money.\n\nAfter eight months, he decided to ask his aunt for cash. Instead, she suggested he get a job bussing tables.\n\n\u201cI didn't really know what that meant,\u201d he admitted.\n\nArana soon got the job working at Cava, and attended a free adult education class at night to better learn the language. After approximately three months as a busboy, he asked for a promotion.\n\n\u201cBetween 3 and 4 months I picked up enough English where I could communicate a lot better and I went to the manager at the restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I think I\u2019m going to do better if you make me a waiter. As a busboy, you know, I'm very limited, and making $30, $40 a night \u2026 it\u2019s not enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nArana waited tables for another eight months, during which time he met his future wife, Kyle, when she was a customer at the restaurant.\n\nLittle did he know, she would change the trajectory of his whole life.\n\nAfter months of seeing each other and going back and forth between Los Angeles, where Kyle lived, and Santa Barbara, Arana decided it was time to move.\n\n\u201cWe had this whole romance story and at that point in time, I realized I needed to move down\u2026I really wanted to be closer to her.\u201d He said. \u201cI figured out I was very in love. I was not going to go and do the master\u2019s degree and I was not going to go back to Bolivia and I was going to stay.\u201d\n\nREAL ESTATE\n\nA cousin suggested Arana pursue real estate, and in 2004, he got his license. At the time, he was unsure what to expect.\n\n\u201cWhen my cousin said, \u2018You should do real estate,\u2019 I was like: \u2018What is real estate?\u2019 \u201d he recalled. \u201cYou know, in Los Angeles and New York, in big cities like these, you can make a living as a real estate agent, but if you go to Bolivia, it's not an aspiration when you\u2019re in college.\u201d\n\nArana struggled at first, he admitted. For the second time in his life, he found himself in a new city where he knew few people other than Kyle, who he married in August of that year.\n\n\u201cWe didn't have any college friends or roommates or high school friends or relatives or nothing. So, who do you sell a house to? How do you sell homes?\u201d he asked. \u201cI really had to, you know, bite to dust.\u201d\n\nFor about three and a half years, Arana knocked on strangers\u2019 doors to try to grow his name as an agent and waited tables at night to make extra money.\n\n\u201cI did a little bit of real estate in the day and worked double shifts in restaurants at night in order to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to do better. In 2007, I dropped the restaurant business.'\n\n\u201cAs I started to do good and have a little bit of savings, the market in 2008 collapsed, and it was horrible.\u201d\n\nNow with two young sons, Arana had eaten away his savings to the point where he had only $1,000 in the bank. It was a year after the housing market collapsed and he begrudgingly decided it was time to consider waiting tables again.\n\nHe went as close as pulling up to a restaurant in Venice to fill out an application, but something stopped him from going in.\n\n\u201cI was sitting in my car and, I remember, something inside me just turn on,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that moment I felt that just something inside me said, \u2018You know, what the hell are you doing?... You're not going to fall backward, if you're going to fall, you\u2019re going to fall forwards.\u201d\n\nIt was a personal moment, and one that introduced Arana to who he really was, he said.\n\n\u201cLiterally, that day I drove straight into my favorite neighborhood, Brentwood Park at the time, and I door-knocked for like three hours nonstop,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going going to go back. I\u2019m gonna make this happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nHIS FIRST MILLION\n\nFrom that point on, Arana went into overdrive. He hosted open houses on Saturdays and Sundays, he borrowed money for advertisements and he posted signs at 6 a.m. before his workday began.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, \u201cduring the worst part of the market, when everybody stopped spending money and started to slow down ... I was one of the few guys that was out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe perception was that I was really busy.\u201d\n\nBy 2012, people were calling Arana remarking about how busy he was, and how many of his signs they had seen, he recalled with a laugh.\n\n\u201cAs the market turned around in 2012, I remember April of 2012 clearly, it activated and it just exploded...People decided, \u2018Okay time to buy, time to sell...Let\u2019s call that guy Santiago.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat was the first year he made more than $1 million in commission, and he's never had a worse year, he said.\n\nSince then, his clientele has included Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James, popstar and breakout actress Lady Gaga, and even billionaire bond fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach, who is the chief investment officer and CEO of DoubleLine Capital in Los Angeles.\n\nImage 1 of 4\n\nArana is known for his familiarity with California\u2019s western region and has previously been lauded as the No. 1 broker \u201cwest of the 405 freeway,\u201d his webpage states.\n\nHe boasts more than $2 billion in real estate sales.\n\nArana and Kyle recently celebrated a 15-year wedding anniversary, and live in Pacific Palisades just north of Santa Monica with their 10- and 12-year-old sons. He is actively involved in Giveback Homes and Habitat for Humanity, often working alongside his wife in doing so.\n\nLooking back, Arana kept his advice to his younger, twenty-something self simple: \u201cEnjoy the moment more.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"When my first son was born is when I realized, \u2018Okay, now I need to enjoy my son, my family, and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time is going to go fast \u2026 You can\u2019t go back in time, so take it all in.\u201d", "description": "Bolivian-born Santiago Arana moved to California with $120, and is the 7th most successful real estate broker in the country.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/f8da7fbb-CCourtneyLindbergPhotography_091217_0004.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
