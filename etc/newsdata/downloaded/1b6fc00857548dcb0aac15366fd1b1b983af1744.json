Absolutely\u2014no question about that. That\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters Thursday in a rare White House press briefing. \u201cWhat happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation, and that is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nAnyone with a problem with that, Mulvaney added, is a naif.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: get over it,\u201d Mulvaney said, in response to ABC\u2019s Jon Karl, who noted that what Mulvaney had just described was exactly the sort of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d arrangement that Trump has repeatedly denied. \u201cThere is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released later Thursday afternoon, after his comments regarding a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d-type understanding sparked a media firestorm, Mulvaney blamed the media for accurately reporting his comments. \u201cThere never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201c\u202aLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian and military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u202c\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments during the presser, held to announce that the president had chosen his own golf resort to host the G7 Summit next summer, severely undercut the White House\u2019s persistent denials that Trump had held back nearly $400 million in congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine in the hopes of pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating unproven theories about two of Trump\u2019s political opponents: the Democratic National Committee and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a partial transcript of a July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Trump asked the leader to investigate Biden\u2019s son\u2019s work with a Ukrainian energy company, and offered the assistance of both his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in doing so.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Trump said at the time, baselessly adding that \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nTrump also requested on the call that Ukraine investigate CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that investigated the hacking of the DNC\u2019s email servers in 2016. The president has floated the conspiracy theory that the hacked servers are in Ukraine, and that their discovery would prove that the Democratic Party leaked damaging emails during the campaign in order to discredit a potential Trump victory as being won through Russian interference. (The American intelligence community has found no indication that anyone but the Russian government was behind the hacking and release of the emails.)\n\nThat phone call, which so concerned White House staff that the transcript was placed on a separate server accessible only to a select few staff, prompted a whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s behavior and has resulted in an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\nMulvaney, who claimed in the presser that pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival is no different than using foreign aide to pressure governments into cracking down on illegal immigration, insisted that the openness with which the Trump administration has described the alleged wrongdoing is proof that there was, in fact, no wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to believe there\u2019s a coverup,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cYou don\u2019t give stuff to the public and say \u2018here it is' if you are trying to cover something up.\u201d", "description": "The White House chief of staff casually confirmed the president held up Ukraine aid over partisan considerations before reversing and claiming the media \u201cmisconstrued\u201d his words.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2636,w_4687,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571337434/RTS2RLEG_xiox8n", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
