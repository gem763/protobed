And oh! By the way, you might as well have the best with you at all times because you don't carry that much stuff.\u201d\n\nBeing able to depend on the gear wasn\u2019t his only lesson. He also learned about failure and responding to it, so when no one bought his treasure he founded a unique race that would help sell his product and leaned on his teambuilding skills.\n\nOf course nobody bought any of it, because nobody had any idea who we were. So quickly, it became: adapt and overcome, or else. - Jason McCarthy, GoRuck founder\n\nRucking or a ruck march, at its most foundational level, means that one is moving with weight on their back, McCarthy said. The rucksack is what carries the weight, he said.\n\nHe tried to launch the company when he was in West Africa after his service. He went there to be with Emily McCarthy, his wife who he met in high school. At the time, she was a CIA officer. Now, she\u2019s a GoRuck senior director and the head of the company\u2019s women\u2019s division.\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nHe made her a \u201cgo-bag\u201d or a \u201cgo-ruck\u201d for the house and her car. He packed similar rucksacks for others at the embassy. He tried to sell the idea of preparedness and kits for people who might need to flee at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t sell.\n\nThat business model was flawed in so many ways because you can't really bring stuff over to West Africa, it's really expensive. - Jason McCarthy, GoRuck founder\n\n\u201cSo that died there, and I was left with the idea for GoRuck and I moved back to New York, and slowly started work on what would become the manufacturing side of GoRuck,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThe dependence on his equipment gave him the idea for his GoRuck rucksacks, but don\u2019t call them backpacks.\n\n\u201cA backpack is like a cheap version of a school bag that kids carry, and it breaks, and tears, and rips very easily while a GoRuck rucksack is very tough and durable and is meant to carry a lot of weight,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy was ready to sell the first samples of his rucksack in 2010 and thought consumers would flock to his beloved item.\n\nIt didn't happen.\n\nAdapt and overcome\n\nSo McCarthy pivoted and turned to what he did know: community building and physical training.\n\nThose elements culminated in the first GoRuck Challenge in San Francisco in September 2010, a miles-long team event with weighted rucksacks. The event also became a means for him to not only product-prove the gear but also have people buy the rucksacks in the process.\n\nTo participate you have to buy his gear. But it proved to be effective.\n\n\u201cWe were sitting there in the parking lot at the end of the event drinking beers together, and everyone was just smiling, proud of themselves,\u201d McCarthy said referring to his first challenge. \u201cThere was empowerment, and there was a small day in the life of what Special Forces training is like.\u201d\n\nAt that moment I knew, that's how we were going to build GoRuck \u2014 that's when it clicked for me. - Jason McCarthy, GoRuck founder\n\nEmily McCarthy also highlighted how important the GoRuck challenges are as community-building events. She explained that the challenges are team undertakings at their core, with teams starting and ending together.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re empowering for not only women but also for kids and the entire community as well,\u201d Emily McCarthy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy your way to camaraderie, you have to earn it. And by communities pushing themselves together, they all have a shared experience, which is lasting and bonding.\u201d\n\nAs GoRuck expanded, Jason noted that scaling and scaling quality have been a never-ending problem. He underscored, however, that he strives to only build the best gear, and that quality inspection of every item is a top priority.\n\n\u201cMy reputation among the Special Forces community is more important than money and I just refuse to build something that one of the guys that I served with would get and say that it\u2019s not a very good kit,\u201d Jason McCarthy said. \u201cThe relentless pursuit of excellence is what we're about and that's directly from my time in Special Forces. It's the best or nothing.\u201d", "description": "Jason McCarthy\u2019s journey to founding his own company started on a day that is carved into the collective consciousness of every American: September 11, 2001.", "authors": ["Emily Deciccio"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/RUCK-LOGO.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
