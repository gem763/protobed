I have three boys and my three boys are 11, 16 and 17 now but one of them, when he was 4 years old, had this horrible case of ulcerative colitis that just wouldn\u2019t respond to any treatment. And it\u2019s just one of these things, where you do all these things that the doctors are telling you to and you still have this kid who is not gaining weight, who is throwing up every day, who is in pain and you sort of get to this point where you are willing to try anything as long as it\u2019s not too risky. We found out about HBOT through a friend whose son is on the autism spectrum. Once that happened, I talked to my son\u2019s doctors, and they gave a reluctant blessing. We knew it could be a waste of time and money but we were desperate. When we did try it, I discovered this intimate world. You have to crawl into the machine and it\u2019s dark. You can\u2019t bring anything in. Nothing you can use to pass the time. So we were forced to talk to each other, an hour at a time. We had all these kids with a range of abilities and disabilities and there was a lot of comparison of our lives. It just became this confessional feel \u2014 very intimate, very intense. I wasn\u2019t a writer at the time, but as soon as I started thinking about writing a novel, I knew it had to be in this setting.", "description": "The debut novel by Kim is Lily Lit Club\u2019s September pick", "authors": ["Neema Roshania Patel", "Neema Roshania Patel Is Deputy Editor Of The Lily."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rEKolvo6j4UtLXilmynXIYZX7XE=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UEFS5DQU7RHSXBHLBDM575JRLU.jpg"}
