It then matched those records against other public population data. The result: Officials were able to infer the identities of 52 million Americans.\n\nConfronted with that discovery, the bureau announced that it would add statistical \u201cnoise\u201d to the 2020 data, essentially tinkering with its own numbers to preserve privacy. But that idea creates its own problems, and social scientists, redistricting experts and others worry that it will make next year\u2019s census less accurate. They say the bureau\u2019s response is overkill.\n\n\u201cThis is a brand new, radically more conservative definition of privacy,\u201d University of Minnesota demographer Steven Ruggles said.\n\nFederal law bars census officials from disclosing any individual\u2019s responses. But data-crunching computers can tease out likely identities from the broader census results when combined with other personal information.\n\nSome critics fear the agency\u2019s changes could make it harder to draw new congressional and legislative districts accurately. Others worry that research on immigration, demographics, the opioid epidemic and declining life expectancy will be hindered, particularly when it involves less populated areas.\n\nIf the change had been in place four years ago, Ruggles said, he would not have been able to conduct a 2015 study on the impact of declines in young men\u2019s incomes on marriage.\n\nWith more and more data sets available to the public with a quick download, it has become easier than ever to match information with real names. That means aggregated answers to census questions involving race, housing and relationships could lead to individuals.\n\nThe fear is that advertisers, market researchers or anybody with know-how and curiosity could use data to reconstruct the identities of census respondents.\n\nWhen the bureau went back to the 2010 census, it matched the census data with commercial databases. More than 1 in 6 respondents were identified by name and neighborhood as well as by information about their race, ethnicity, sex and age.\n\nSince the last census, \u201cthe data world has changed dramatically,\u201d Ron Jarmin, deputy director of the census agency wrote earlier this year. \u201cMuch more personal information is available online and from commercial providers, and the technology to manipulate that data is more powerful than ever.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 questionnaire heightened fears about how census information would be used. But privacy concerns are nothing new for the bureau.\n\nHistorians have found evidence that census data helped identify Japanese Americans who were rounded up and confined to camps during World War II. That revelation led to an apology from then-Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt in 2000.\n\nJewish groups and some liberal organizations had concerns about privacy when the bureau was lobbied to ask about religion for the 1960 census. Some noted that Nazis had used government and church records to identify and round up Jews. The idea never went anywhere.\n\nDuring the legal battle over the citizenship question, advocates worried that the information could be used to target residents in the country illegally. Some say lingering concerns could have a chilling effect on the 2020 census.\n\nTo address those worries, the bureau has adopted a technique called \u201cdifferential privacy,\u201d which alters the numbers but does not change core findings to protect the identities of individual respondents.\n\nIt\u2019s analogous to pixilating the data, a technique commonly used to blur certain images on television, said Michael Hawes, senior adviser for data access and privacy at the Census Bureau.\n\nRedistricting experts say the mathematical blurring could cause problems because they rely on precise numbers to draw congressional and state and local legislative districts. They also worry that it could dilute minority voting power and violate the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\u201cThe numbers might be off by five, 10, 20 people, and if you\u2019re dealing with exact percentages, that could mean something. That could mean a lot,\u201d said Jeffrey M. Wice, a national redistricting attorney. \u201cThat\u2019s why we care about it so much.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the bureau has used \u201cswapping\u201d and other methods to protect confidentiality. Swapping involves taking similar households in different geographic areas and exchanging demographic characteristics.\n\nCensus data does not need to be exact for most purposes, \u201cas long as we know it\u2019s really pretty close,\u201d said Justin Levitt, an election law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But \u201cthere\u2019s certainly a point where blurry becomes too blurry.\u201d\n\nThe bureau has not decided precisely how much blurring will take place, but researchers have already delivered academic papers and organized a petition signed by more than 4,000 scholars, planners and journalists. The petition asked the bureau to include the research community in its discussions.\n\nMichael McDonald, a University of Florida redistricting expert, said people must be assured their data will be kept confidential or they may not respond at all. If respondents do not answer questions for the once-a-decade census in a timely manner, census workers must try to interview them in person.\n\n\u201cWe need high response rates to the census,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get them, whatever noise will be moot because we won\u2019t have good data to start with.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In an age of rapidly advancing computer power, the U.S. Census Bureau recently undertook an experiment to see if census answers could threaten the privacy of the people who fill out the questionnaires.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/census_data_privacy_48127_c0-275-3377-2243_s1770x1032.jpg?f7ff0ec19217023b47adb08d850a8dd77b9eedaf", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
