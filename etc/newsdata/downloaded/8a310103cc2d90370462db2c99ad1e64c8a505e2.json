Although the texts do not mention Biden by name, congressional Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry are pointing to them as clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing \u201cto launch politically motivated investigations,\u201d top Democrats said in statement Thursday night.\n\n\u201cheard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker texted Zelensky\u2019s aide, Andrey Yermak, on July 25, hours before Trump and the Ukrainian president spoke via phone. The rough transcript of that conversation was released by the White House last week.\n\nYet two weeks after that call, the president still had not agreed to meet with Zelensky \u2014 and administration officials sought to convince the Ukrainians that Trump would need a public pledge before agreeing to the meeting, according to the text messages.\n\n\u201cI think potus really wants the deliverable,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland texted to Volker on Aug. 9, noting that Zelensky might give a news conference announcing his intent to investigate. \u201cTo avoid misunderstandings, might be helpful to ask Andrey for a draft statement (embargoed) so that we can see exactly what they propose to cover.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com World National-Security This-Is-When-The-Inquiry-Gets-Real-Former-Us-Special-Envoy-To-Ukraine-Testifies-In-Impeachment-Probe-Today"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
