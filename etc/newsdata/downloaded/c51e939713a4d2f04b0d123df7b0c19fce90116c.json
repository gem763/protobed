We will always be brothers. We are certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to, because we are so busy, but I love him dearly.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018The majority of the stuff is created out of nothing, but as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe Princes Harry and William along with their wives Meghan and Kate were previously referred to as the \u2018Fab Four\u2019 after they worked together on charity organisation The Royal Foundation, which operates in the fields of wildlife conservation, mental health, early years, young people, and the armed forces community.\n\nHowever, earlier this year it was announced that the two couples would no longer be working on the charity together, with only Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middledon left looking after the company.\n\nThis move came after rumours of a rift between the two branches of the royal family had begun to circulate.\n\nThese rumours surfaced at the end of last year when Harry and Meghan moved out of Kensington Palace.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nInitial reports suggested it was Kate and Megan who did not get along, but credible sources have since said the problem was instead between the brothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April of this year, it was reported that Kate Middleton was trying to repair the relationship between the two brothers, and, according to the Mirror, she and her husband had had tea and chatted for half an hour with Harry and Meghan after the latter couple invited the former to Frogmore Cottage after the Easter service at Windsor.\n\nAt the time, a source said: \u2018The Duchess and Harry have developed a very close bond over the years.\n\n\u2018Kate is acutely aware of the importance of William and Harry getting along, not just because of perception but their collective responsibility to the monarchy as a whole.\n\n\u2018Harry has acted as counsel to his brother throughout William and Kate\u2019s more turbulent years, and the three of them had gone on to form the most tremendous partnership.\u2019\n\nAs the perhaps only people in the world who can truly understand what the other has been through, not only when it comes to growing up so firmly in the public eye but also the tragic death of their mother, Princess Diana, the two Princes had previously been seen as very close.\n\nBack in April, a source added: \u2018It can be very lonely at the top and sometimes William is left feeling that he is facing such tremendous responsibility alone.\n\n\u2018His wife is a great support, but what they have experienced as children and the history they share is incomparable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018At the very core, that is what has hurt them both so deeply.\n\n\u2018But at one point, one of them is going to have to swallow their pride and admit there is a problem that needs addressing, before all is lost.\u2019\n\nMORE: Prince Andrew and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s friendship investigated on Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches", "description": "Rumours of a rift between the brothers have persisted for months.
