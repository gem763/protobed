On Fox & Friends Wednesday, Baden cited the breakage of several bones in Epstein\u2019s neck that \u201care extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the evidence points to homicide rather than suicide,\u201d he said.\n\nBaden\u2019s claims are not new. Two weeks after Epstein, who awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, died in jail on August 10, his lawyers raised concerns about the New York City medical examiner\u2019s conclusion that their client died by suicide. \u201cWe are told by a very experienced forensic pathologist that the broken bones in Mr. Epstein\u2019s neck, his larynx, are more consistent with external pressure, with strangulation, with homicide if you will, than with suicide,\u201d Epstein\u2019s lawyer Martin Weinberg said in court on August 27.\n\nIt was known at the time that Baden had observed the Epstein autopsy, but his name wasn\u2019t attached to Epstein\u2019s lawyer\u2019s claim. It\u2019s unclear why, two months later, Baden has gone on TV to reassert the claim that Epstein did not kill himself.\n\nBaden is not alone in thinking that Epstein\u2019s injuries raise questions about how he died. The hyoid bone in particular has drawn the most attention because it is often broken during strangulation, not suicide. In August, Jonathan Arden, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, told the Washington Post that a broken hyoid bone \u201cwould generally raise questions about strangulation, but it is not definitive and does not exclude suicidal hanging.\u201d\n\nBut the focus on Epstein\u2019s hyoid bone has also drawn criticism, in part because older people are likelier to break their hyoids in a hanging. Also, the presence of several broken bones in Epstein\u2019s neck is more consistent with suicide than strangulation, several experts told CNN. As one surgeon told the network, a broken hyoid is \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
