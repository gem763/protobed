Trump also sought help in reviving a long-ago debunked conspiracy theory that challenges the basic underpinnings of the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s findings on Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, in a bizarre spectacle that sees an American president trying to conscript a foreign leader into undermining his own intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike,\u201d Trump said, according to a compilation of notes on the call released by he White House. \u201cI guess you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nTo those not versed in fringe-right canon it\u2019s a curious thing to say. \u201cIt almost sounds like he was babbling to the president of Ukraine,\u201d said Robert Johnston, CEO of Adlumin, who led the DNC breach investigation while at Crowdstrike. \u201cI imagine it would have confused the Ukranian president. Like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\u201d\n\nConservative websites are spinning the odd exchange as a reference to a Justice Department investigation ordered by William Barr into the origins of the Mueller probe. \u201cIt is unclear specifically what Trump was referring to with Crowdstrike,\u201d reads one article in this vein on The Federalist. In truth, it\u2019s actually quite clear. Trump is referencing a conspiracy theory pushed by Russian trolls and far-right pundits that imagines the Democratic National Committee fabricating all the evidence in Russia\u2019s 2016 breach of the DNC network.\n\n\u201c Trump has shown a pronounced preference for the pretend version of events. \u201d\n\nThe hoax has its roots in a GRU persona, \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d created to cast doubt on Russia\u2019s culpability in the DNC hack. Today it\u2019s buttressed by deceptive blog posts, memes and putative forensic analysis of metadata in documents leaked from the DNC and John Podesta intrusions, and has spun out several related theories and offshoots, including the Seth Rich hoax that blames the hack on a slain DNC staffer with previously-unknown hacking skills.\n\nCrowdstrike enters the picture because it\u2019s the security firm the DNC hired to investigate the breach back in 2016, and the first of many to identify Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU, as the perpetrator. A publicly-traded company headquartered in California, Crowdstrike has nothing to do with Ukraine, except in conspiracyland, which pretends that Crowdstrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is Ukranian, and that he framed Russia for election interference both on the DNC\u2019s orders and to punish Putin for invading his homeland.\n\nIn real life, Alperovitch is American citizen born in Russia who escaped to the U.S. with his family during the Soviet era. But Trump has shown a pronounced preference for the pretend version.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server?\u201d Trump asked the AP in 2017. \u201cThey brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based \u2026 I heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that\u2019s what I heard.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cserver\u201d in the conspiracy is the hacked DNC server that the democrats, the claim goes won\u2019t let the FBI examine, because it would expose their elaborate plot. \u201cWhat is the server saying?\u201d Trump asked in one tweet last year.\n\nThat part\u2019s made up, too. The DNC turned down one unusual FBI request early in the hack investigation. The bureau wanted access to the DNC\u2019s network while the Russians were still in it, most likely to stage a counter operation against the GRU. The DNC declined, perhaps reluctant to have two intelligence agencies playing capture-the-flag in their systems five months before a presidential election. The DNC later authorized Crowdstrike to share full copies of the hacked servers with the bureau, giving the FBI access to the same evidence Crowdstrike had.\n\n\u201cWith regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI,\u201d Crowdstrike said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cAs we\u2019ve stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.\u201d\n\nIn truth, Crowdstrike\u2019s findings were never controversial among security experts, and they were later confirmed by FBI agents with access to the same evidence, as well as additional evidence Crowdstrike never had. In October 2018, Robert Mueller indicted 12 GRU officers for the DNC intrusion and hacks targeting John Podesta and the DCCC.\n\nToday the secret server hoax is mostly confined to the very edge of the conservative fringe, though it\u2019s made an appearance in court. Indicted former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone has been using the theory to try and get evidence against him thrown out of court, even filing an affidavit written by William Binney, one of the conspiracy theory\u2019s most dogged advocates. Last week the federal judge overseeing Stone\u2019s obstruction of justice case rejected his motion without ruling on the conspiracy theory itself.", "description": "Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to help prove a bonkers, Russia-friendly conspiracy theory that U.S. intel relied on manufactured evidence to blame the 2016 DNC hack on Moscow.", "authors": ["Kevin Poulsen", "Sr. National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569443753/190925-poulsen-trump-tease_szezrv", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
