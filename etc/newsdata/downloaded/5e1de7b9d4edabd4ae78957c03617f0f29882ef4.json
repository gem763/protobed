The other day, his agent and his parents were telling me about this \u20ac50m evaluation. I replied that for me he is worth \u20ac300m, which means I don\u2019t want to sell.\n\n\"I have a dream. If Sandro accepts, I am ready to make a big financial sacrifice to extend his contract.\n\n\"It\u2019s up to him to decide. He can stay here and enjoy his football, or go to a big club and risk being left on the bench.\"", "description": "Man Utd have joined a host of top clubs in the race to land Sandro Tonali, dubbed the next Andrea Pirlo", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Reuters", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754987.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Serie-A-Brescia-v-Inter-Milan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
