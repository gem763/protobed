Players say they were not rattled by the turbulence they faced during their two exhibition games against the Los Angeles Lakers last week, which came as the NBA dealt with the fallout from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s now-deleted tweet in support of support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nJoe Harris was just in China last month for the Basketball World Cup and said this trip wasn\u2019t much different.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, you know there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on but the atmosphere was really very similar to what it was during the World Cup,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe fans were extremely passionate. They love the game. They still sold out both games, so take out everything that was actually going on it really felt like almost exactly the same.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to ignore everything, with Chinese and NBA officials canceling events and news conferences, and advertising and local television coverage for the games in Shanghai and Shenzhen removed.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we\u2019re human and we see those things, so we just tried to stick together as much as we could,\u201d guard Caris LeVert said.\n\nThe Nets who did speak to reporters - Kyrie Irving wasn\u2019t among them - said they hadn\u2019t seen Morey\u2019s tweet and couldn\u2019t recall when they learned of it. Both teams met with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver shortly after arriving, where Harris said the commissioner outlined what was happening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like he was standing in front of everybody and making some, like, dramatic commentary,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe was basically describing what we already knew was going on.\u201d\n\nIrving spoke up in the meeting, but Harris said those remarks were not political but rather related mostly to basketball.\n\n\u201cIt was more just focusing on trying to get ready for the games,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHarris said one of his community events, a visit with children at a play area, still went on. So did the team functions planned by new owner Joe Tsai, the co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.\n\nTsai posted a lengthy letter to fans on Facebook following Morey\u2019s tweet, which Harris said the owner encouraged the players to read. He was around the team during the week getting the know players and staff.\n\nHe made a good impression with his dinners, which Harris indicated were even better than Gregg Popovich\u2019s while playing for the U.S.\n\n\u201cI mean Pop had a lot of good dinners and stuff planned when we were out there too,\u201d Harris said, \u201cbut I\u2019d say Joe Tsai is probably a little more familiar with some of the dining establishments in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Brooklyn Nets played well and ate great on their trip to China.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/china_nba_31223_c0-155-3722-2326_s1200x700.jpg?8d4efc9f2c06db816b34ff1767d6d279aca18a0f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
