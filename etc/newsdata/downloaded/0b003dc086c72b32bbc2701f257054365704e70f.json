Anytime you win on the road, in division, it's good -- especially here because it's been a challenge for us.\"\n\n- Prescott shines -\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys improved to 2-0 with a second straight win over an NFC East division foe, downing the Redskins 31-21 in Washington.\n\nQuarterback Dak Prescott completed 26 of 30 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns - atoning for a lone interception on the second drive of the game.\n\nPrescott responded by piloting the Cowboys to touchdowns on three straight drives. Dallas sealed the game with a touchdown run by Ezekiel Elliott that pushed the score to 31-14.\n\nThere were closer calls for the Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions.\n\nThe Texans emerged 13-12 winners over Jacksonville after Houston's Justin Reid stopped Jags running back Leonard Fournette on a two-point conversion effort with 36 seconds left.\n\nThe Seahawks held on for a 28-26 win over the Steelers in Pittsburgh, where Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson led three straight scoring drives in the second half.\n\nAfter Pittsburgh had trimmed the deficit to two points with 5:54 to play, Wilson and the Seattle offense were able to hold onto the ball and the win against a Steelers team that saw quarterback Ben Roethlisberger depart with an elbow injury at halftime.\n\nThe Colts edged the Tennessee Titans 19-17 in Nashville and the Lions defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 13-10 after Detroit defender Darius Slay grabbed a poorly thrown pass by Philip Rivers in the end zone with 1:03 remaining.", "description": "With controversial receiver Antonio Brown on board, even a trip to Miami proved no stumbling block to the NFL champion New England Patriots.
