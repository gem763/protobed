People are with us, at least if we keep our focus on the main things we can achieve.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg had delivered a similar warning against \u201cpurity tests\u201d to former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas at Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, saying that it didn\u2019t sound like Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal for a mandatory ban and buyback of military-style, semiautomatic weapons was fully fleshed out.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke said people shouldn\u2019t be limited by \u201cthe polls and the consultants and the focus groups.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg shot back that he didn\u2019t need lessons from Mr. O\u2019Rourke on courage, \u201cpersonal or political.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
