TV commercials are traditionally purchased with only the capability to target people by age and gender.\n\nThe purchase amount could not be learned. A Xandr spokesman declined to comment. Clypd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe deal will also add linear TV ad inventory, or ad space, from clypd\u2019s clients to Xandr Community, a product that pools advertising space from AT&T-owned properties that include WarnerMedia and DirecTV, but also third parties like cable networks A+E and AMC, the source said.\n\nThe addition helps resolve a concern from some advertising buyers that Community did not offer access to enough valuable linear TV, which still reaches a larger audience than streaming services.\n\nThe deal comes as AT&T is fending off activist investor Elliott Management, which has questioned its $85 billion (66.1 billion pounds) purchase of Time Warner. It has also called for AT&T to consider selling satellite TV provider DirecTV, which has been losing subscribers.\n\nAT&T has resisted suggestions such as getting rid of DirecTV because that would undercut its master plan to create a powerful advanced advertising machine by stitching together wireless, satellite TV and content operations.\n\nThe plan would allow advertisers to reach the right viewers and more effectively measure their ads.\n\nClypd is the second deal under Xandr Chief Executive Brian Lesser, who previously led ad agency GroupM in North America, to build Xandr\u2019s ad tech capabilities. It bought AppNexus, a digital advertising tech platform, last year for a reported $1.6 billion.", "description": "AT&T Inc's advertising unit Xandr has purchased clypd, an advertising platform that uses data to better target television ads, a source familiar with the matter said, as Xandr seeks to make TV commercials as personally targeted as internet ads.", "authors": ["Sheila", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
