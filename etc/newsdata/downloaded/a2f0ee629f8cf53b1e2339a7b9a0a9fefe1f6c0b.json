Republicans acknowledged Tuesday they could lose at least one, and as many as three, of those seats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe judges, two Democrats and one Republican, ruled that the current district maps, in use since 2016, represented an \u201cextreme partisan gerrymander\u201d that violated a provision in the state constitution guaranteeing \u201cfree elections.\u201d The court order bars North Carolina from holding primary elections, scheduled for March 3, under the current boundary lines.\n\nAt the same time, the judges accepted newly drawn state-level district lines crafted by the legislature after the court ordered last month that they redrawn for similar reasons. The Republican-led legislature did not appeal that ruling, seeing little hope of success before the state Supreme Court, which has a Democratic majority.\n\nThe maps struck down on Monday, drawn after a similar challenge to the way North Carolina crafted its political boundaries following the 2010 Census, gave Republicans the majority of the state\u2019s 13 seats in Congress, even though Republicans won the popular vote there by just 2 percentage points. Democrats argued the Republican-drawn lines unfairly diluted their political power and enhanced the GOP\u2019s chances of winning seats in Congress.\n\n\u201cEven though both were fairly egregious gerrymanders, I think that there\u2019s an argument to be made that the congressional maps were worse,\u201d said state Rep. Robert Reives, one of the Democrats who led the party\u2019s redistricting efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re glad that we have fairer maps than we\u2019ve had in recent memory.\u201d\n\nLegislative leaders have not yet said whether they plan to appeal the congressional district ruling. But after redrawing legislative boundaries in just two weeks in what even Democrats have acknowledged was a more transparent process, they are unlikely to challenge the new ruling before the state Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI assume we\u2019re going to be drawing maps in the next month,\u201d said state Rep. Pricey Harrison (D), who helped redraw the legislative district boundaries last month. \u201cEven if you just ran simulated maps, you\u2019d end up with a nearly half-and-half split. I think we\u2019re looking at fairer representation for the state of North Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe legislature will have to move with some haste to avoid a delayed primary. North Carolina state law sets the filing deadline for candidates on Dec. 2 \u2014 just five weeks from now.\n\nIf the legislature opts to redraw district lines again, it is almost certain to sow chaos among the 10 Republicans who hold seats in Congress. Three of those members \u2014 Reps.

Political observers said the GOP\u2019s best-case scenario was that a court would accept maps that could give them eight or nine seats in the next election.\n\n\u201cIt could reshape how the 2020 elections are going to play out. Last year\u2019s election, even with what felt like a Democratic surge, maybe not a wave but a surge, the lines held. Political behavior of these districts bought the Repubs the insurance policy they had hoped,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College.\n\nThe best-case scenario for Democrats, Harrison said, would be as many as seven of the 13 seats \u2014 though she acknowledged that was an unlikely outcome.\n\nSeveral Republicans could be forced into the uncomfortable prospect of challenging each other to keep their seats.

And they are all nervous as heck.\u201d\n\nThe ruling \u201ccreates a lot of confusion and uncertainty for the people in North Carolina, it's really a disservice to them. But you know it's up to the courts and the legislature to determine what's fair and what the districts ought to look like, so I really don't have a role in that,\u201d Hudson told The Hill.\n\nBitzer pointed to western North Carolina, where the heavily Democratic city of Asheville is split between districts held by Reps.

If the new maps put Asheville solely in one district, it could give Democrats a chance to pick up a seat that the GOP easily held in 2018 \u2014 a district that might look similar to one held by former Rep. Heath Shuler (D) a decade ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned two things: Worry about the things you have control over, and I don\u2019t have control over this. And two, if you are too worried about keeping this job, you\u2019re focused on the wrong things,\u201d Meadows told The Hill.\n\nRepublicans have been stymied by a series of Democratic court victories in North Carolina, even as the U.S. Supreme Court refused to get involved in partisan gerrymandering cases earlier this year. Democratic groups have been challenging Republican-drawn lines and Republican-backed election legislation for most of this decade.\n\nOne powerful North Carolina Republican used the latest setback to remind his voters of the power of judicial politics. North Carolina is one of eight states in which Supreme Court justices run with partisan affiliations; today, six of the seven members of the state\u2019s high court are Democrats.\n\n\u201cWith judges deciding behind closed doors how many members of Congress from each party is acceptable, judicial elections have become the most consequential in America,\u201d state Senate President Phil Berger (R) said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Scott Wong and Juliegrace Brufke contributed to this report.", "description": "A North Carolina court ruling on Monday ordering the state legislature to redraw congressional district boundaries has Republican members of Congress reconsidering their future in what is almost certain to be a boon for Democrats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/northcarolinaelection_121118hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
