Tony Evers.\n\nSome farmers and ranchers demanded Perdue be fired and replaced with someone who supports smaller independent operations rather than big corporations in America\u2019s heartland.\n\nPerdue said Tuesday at the World Dairy Expo in Madison that he wasn\u2019t holding out much hope for the survival of family dairy operations with fewer than 100 cows.\n\n\u201cNow what we see, obviously, is economies of scale having happened in America \u2014 big get bigger and small go out,\u201d Perdue said flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t think in America we, for any small business, have a guaranteed income or a guaranteed probability of survival.\u201d\n\nEvers complained to journalists Wednesday that Perdue \u201cput the pox on small farming in the state,\u201d The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n\u201cAre they struggling? Absolutely,\u201d said Evers. \u201cBut I think at the end of the day we need to get behind them rather than saying, \u2019Ah maybe you should go larger.\u2032 I, frankly, resent that the Department of Agriculture secretary from the federal government came in and kind of lambasted them.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake about it, Trump's Administration is no friend to America's Dairyland. We need to stand by our farmers and have their backs when times get tough. https://t.co/bl4WaFCB6l \u2014 Governor Tony Evers (@GovEvers) October 3, 2019\n\nDarin Von Ruden, president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union who runs a 50-cow organic farm, complained to reporters that larger farms are \u201cnot a good way to go,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cDo we want one corporation to own all the food in our country?\u201d Von Ruden asked.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at something that will benefit all of rural America, not just corporate rural America. Secretary Perdue is supposed to represent all U.S. farmers, but I don\u2019t think we saw that here today.\" https://t.co/8kQU0NpZSv \u2014 WI Farmers Union (@wifarmersunion) October 2, 2019\n\nAn organization of women in agriculture, Women Involved in Farm Economics, demanded that Perdue be fired and replaced with someone who supports smaller farm and ranch operations, and not Big Ag corporations.\n\n\u201cWith fewer and fewer places to sell our products and no support from our government to stop concentration in the agriculture market, farmers and ranchers are squeezed,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Diane McDonald, told Nebraska\u2019s McCook Gazette.\n\nCattle ranchers at a rally in Omaha on Wednesday coordinated by the Organization for Open Markets also called for Perdue\u2019s firing, accusing him of promoting corporate meatpackers at the expense of American independent cattle ranchers.\n\nToday, cattle farmers and ranchers are holding a rally in Omaha, Nebraska to stand against meatpacker monopolies calling the @USDA to defend #FairCattleMarkets. They list 6 actions the administration can take right now to save the US cattle market: https://t.co/P3oDVzyF1e pic.twitter.com/i3hEfsUIxA \u2014 Open Markets (@openmarkets) October 2, 2019\n\n\u201cThere is nothing natural or inevitable about consolidation in agriculture,\u201d Claire Calloway, a researcher at Open Markets Institute, said in a statement. \u201cFarmers are pushed to get big or get out because of policies that enable predatory monopolies to strip wealth from farmers.\u201d\n\nPerdue has the ability to \u201cenact policies that would crack down on the abusive agriculture monopolies that are pushing out small producers and independent family farms,\u201d Calloway added.\n\nTrump declared in July during a visit to Wisconsin \u2014 much to the surprise of farmers the president calls \u201chis patriots\u201d \u2014 that \u201csome of the farmers are doing really well. We\u2019re over the hump.\u201d\n\nRural areas were crucial to Trump\u2019s election in 2016.", "description": "\"Make no mistake about it, Trump's administration is no friend to America's dairyland,\" Democratic Gov.
