REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Illustration\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Britain and the EU had agreed a new Brexit deal, and he recommended that the EU summit endorse it. Both sides had found a \u201clegally operative solution\u201d to avoid a hard border in Ireland, EU negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters.\n\nSome of the gains fizzled after the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Johnson relies on in parliament said there had been no change in their position, having earlier expressed concern the deal could cut Northern Ireland off from Britain in customs and regulatory terms.\n\nThe deal also will be subject to a vote by the British parliament.\n\nHowever the currency and most British assets were celebrating the apparent breakthrough, with sterling on track for its biggest six-day rise since October 1985 GBP=, with a gain of 6%\n\nIt jumped as high as $1.2988 GBP=D3, a five-month high. Against the euro it rose sharply to 85.77 pence EURGBP=D3. It's been on a rollercoaster ride of late, up 8% since early September when it hit the lowest since October 2016 at $1.19.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve got something that would be the basis for a vote,\u201d said Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale. \u201cNow we will try to scramble up if he (Johnson) has got enough votes to pass the deal through the parliament.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis could get through,\u201d he said, adding further gains were likely if traders rushed to offload short positions against the currency.\n\nThe euro was also buoyed by the news, rising to a seven-week high of $1.1140 EUR=EBS while the dollar index pulled back 0.3% .DXY\n\nBritish government bond yields surged, with 10-year yields rising to 0.793%, their highest since July GB10YT=RR.\n\nFor a graphic on Sterling rallies, gilt yields rise, click here\n\nSTOCKS AND RATE CUTS\n\nThe news also sent British and European stocks higher across the board, with the UK mid-cap index up as much as 1.1% .FTMC. Germany's DAX .GDAX rallied 0.5% while Ireland's .ISEQ gained 0.3%.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s basket of London-listed companies .JPDEUKDM that make their cash at home soared as much as 2.2%, extending its meteoric rally of the past week.\n\nIn this period it has vastly outperformed the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 .FTMC. The benchmark is considered a barometer of Brexit worries, with half its stocks making their money in the domestic market.\n\n\u201cWhile Parliament approval is still required, the news today should provide legs to the rotation from UK exporters to domestic plays,\u201d Barclays Capital European equities strategist Emmanuel Cau.\n\nFor a graphic on UK Plc's domestic vs exporter stocks, click here\n\nHowever, optimism that a Brexit deal would be finalised saw money markets reduce expectations of rate cuts from the Bank of England. They now see a 60% chance of a quarter point cut next December versus 76% on Tuesday and 90% last week BOEWATCH.\n\nEuro zone money markets too priced out chances of a year-end rate cut ECBWATCH\n\nInvestor uncertainty remains high however, options markets indicated, with the British Parliament scheduled to sit on Saturday and debate the outcome of the summit.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is too early, I wouldn\u2019t be taking any direction at this point. It doesn\u2019t make sense to be taking steps either way on sterling at this point,\u201d said Michael Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan.", "description": "Sterling surged more than 1% and British share prices rallied on Thursday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Union officials said a Brexit deal was done.", "authors": ["Olga Cotaga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441828751&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0RZ", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
