Any reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nPurchasing managers attributed the marked slowdown to Brexit uncertainty and the resulting hesitancy among clients, IHS said.\n\nJohnson is sending what he says is the U.K.'s \"final offer (link)\" for a Brexit deal to the European Union on Wednesday.\n\nRussell Investments, in a new strategy note, says the U.K. will hold either an election or a second referendum to break the Brexit impasse, and that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are receding. The fund manager says U.K. equities are \"moderately cheap\" though there may be short-term losses ahead for large-caps due to sterling upside risks.\n\nThe U.K. FTSE 100 skidded 1.48% to 7251.33, with markets across Europe feeling the pain from weak U.S. manufacturing data released on Tuesday.\n\nThe pound traded at $1.2243, down from $1.2305 on Tuesday.\n\nTesco (TSCO.LN) was in focus as the supermarket group reported a rise in pretax profit (link)and also announced the departure of its chief executive.\n\nTesco's \"strong interims confirm major self-help helping overcome a tough U.K. backdrop,\" said analysts at Jefferies, which reiterated a buy rating. \"But also acknowledge that the news of Dave Lewis stepping down in 2020 to be replaced by Ken Murphy should prove unhelpful.\"\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 02, 2019 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
