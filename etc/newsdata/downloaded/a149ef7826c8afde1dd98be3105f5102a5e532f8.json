In the match against Scotland, it was as if the 15 were not fighting against 15 but 70,015,\" he said, adding that tickets had been sold out for almost all matches.\n\nRugby tickets are now like gold dust in Japan, with several fans taking to Twitter to plead for spares.\n\n\"Could someone sell me one or two Japan-SAfrica tickets please? I've heard there would be some ticket sales on the day but probably you can't get one unless you queue up from the previous day,\" one desperate man tweeted.\n\nThose not lucky enough to have tickets are watching in huge numbers on TV. A peak of more than 50 percent of the country tuned in to watch Japan's last pool game against Scotland according to ratings company Video Research.\n\nEven higher ratings are expected for the match against South Africa, by far the biggest match in Japan's rugby history.\n\nRugby is also featuring on daytime television, with NTV's hugely popular morning show devoting a large segment to the Springbok match on Sunday.\n\nWhen a rugby expert noted South Africa would play its strongest team, the show's star presenter Koji Kato exclaimed: \"Good!\"\n\n\"This means Japan will let the strongest team down,\" Kato said, drawing laughter from others on the show.\n\nSeveral TV channels are replaying some of Japan's best moments from the World Cup so far, including their 28-21 win over Scotland that guaranteed them a pool top spot and the right to face the Boks.\n\nImages of Japan 34-32 \"Miracle of Brighton\" defeat of South Africa in 2015 are being repeated endlessly, while clips showing a buoyant atmosphere within the Japanese camp have been going viral -- including one of the players singing \"Victory Road\" to the tune of \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\".\n\nThe Japanese are crazy for omiyage or \"souvenirs\" of an experience or event and Brave Blossoms replica shirts are flying off the shelves.\n\nEvery morning outside a sports equipment store near the Japanese training ground, a long queue snakes around the block as both foreign and local fans try to get their hands on a precious red and white jersey -- at up to 10,000 yen apiece.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Long queues for replica shirts, desperate searches for tickets and TV stations showing Japan's wins on a loop: excitement is building ahead of the host nation's historic Rugby World Cup quarterfinal against South Africa.
