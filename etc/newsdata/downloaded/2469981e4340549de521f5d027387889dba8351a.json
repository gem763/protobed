This feature can be summoned by long-pressing the camera switcher next to the shutter button, then releasing when you hover over your desired lens.\n\nThis lens switcher offers few quality-of-life tweaks that put it ahead of Apple\u2019s native solution. For one, unlike Apple\u2019s on-screen overlays in the Camera app, Halide\u2019s options don\u2019t obscure the viewfinder. Instead, the dial is accessible in the corner of your screen so you won\u2019t get thrown off trying to keep your subject in the frame. Speaking of framing, another useful addition is \u201cLens Guides,\u201d which appear in the viewfinder when you\u2019re switching between lenses to indicate how the crop of each lens differs.\n\nHalide says that this update also brings its Smart RAW to the range of iPhone 11 models. According to the company\u2019s blog post, it\u2019s currently at work to optimize the app\u2019s exposure logic to minimize noise in RAW files.\n\nIf you were hoping that this update would allow you to simultaneously shoot RAW from all three of the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s lenses, you won\u2019t find it here. The reason why it\u2019s not here is complicated. It could appear at some point, however, but not without trade-offs. Halide\u2019s Ben Sandofsky said that implementing such a feature would \u201cinvolve switching between complex internal iOS machinery, which hasn\u2019t worked out well in the past.\u201d\n\nThis update is live now. If you don\u2019t already have Halide, you can purchase it through the App Store for $5.99.", "description": "Halide has issued a big update (version 1.14) for its app that offers extended support for the the multi-lens camera systems in the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro lineup.
