She is a bright and thoughtful young woman with an attractive smile that flits across her face occasionally as we spend several hours discussing her background, her family and her short life.\n\nWith her long, tousled, chestnut hair and short, checked red dress, she looks like many of the 50,000 cheerful students who throng the bustling Belgian city of Leuven, home to the country\u2019s biggest university.\n\nYet there is a big difference. For this friendly woman sitting on the sofa beside me \u2013 someone younger than both of my own children \u2013 is telling me an anguished tale of deep personal torment.\n\n\u2018When I look in the mirror, I see a monster,\u2019 she says at one point, although dark rings around her eyes are the only outward sign of her struggles. \u2018I really don\u2019t like what I see.\u2019\n\nKelly aged 11, right, and left, now, aged 23. She says she has never had happy days in her life\n\nKelly (pictured with boyfriend Bregt) is plagued by mental health problems that she describes as being like a knife plunged in her chest \u2013 and we are meeting to discuss her determination to die\n\nSuch words do not seem to match the person speaking them. But Kelly is plagued by mental health problems that she describes as being like a knife plunged in her chest \u2013 and we are meeting to discuss her determination to die.\n\n\u2018It won\u2019t hurt so I don\u2019t see the problem,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018It is like going to sleep, and for the first time in my life it will be quick. I won\u2019t be lying in bed waiting for it to come.\u2019\n\nIn almost every place on the planet, this would be a huge problem. But Belgium is one of three countries that permit such euthanasia, making no distinction between \u2018unbearable\u2019 physical and mental pain. The other two are Holland and Luxembourg.\n\nYet even in Belgium \u2013 which, 17 years ago, became the world\u2019s second country to sanction euthanasia and the first to legalise it for children \u2013 psychiatric cases remain controversial, especially when they involve someone as young as Kelly. Mental health patients account for about three per cent of the 17,000 people killed since the law was changed in this country of 11 million citizens. There were 2,357 deaths last year \u2013 ten times as many as in the first year euthanasia was legal in Belgium \u2013 and most involved elderly people.\n\nMany psychiatrists and most Belgians oppose extension of euthanasia to mental health cases. Some experts argue diagnosis is subjective, unlike severe physical illness, and insist the lives of distressed younger patients can improve with time, therapy and medication.\n\nYet Kelly, whose birthday is this week, plans to die as soon as legally possible so has no time for such arguments. \u2018It feels like discrimination,\u2019 she said. \u2018It makes me angry. It\u2019s just not fair. They don\u2019t understand the pain.\n\n\u2018People look at me and see someone so young but I feel bad inside all the time. It is not the age that is important but the suffering of the person.\u2019\n\nThis woman \u2013 so open and yet obviously troubled \u2013 highlights the complexity of this issue as Britain faces growing pressure from some patients and politicians to permit doctor-assisted death.\n\nOpponents argue legalisation is a slippery slope.\n\nKelly lives with her family near Leuven \u2013 yet incredibly had not told her parents, identical twin sister or younger sibling of her plan. She was due to break the news to them four days after our discussion, something she admitted she was dreading.\n\n\u2018It is not going to be easy to tell them. I think my sisters will understand more than my parents. But it will obviously be very difficult, especially for my twin sister.\u2019\n\nThe reason for her failure to tell her family soon becomes clear. She is fond of her father, a salesman, but said her relationship with her mother, a former cleaning lady, was very difficult, leaving her feeling unloved and insecure at home.\n\n\u2018As a child I did not understand what was happening,\u2019 she says.\n\nHer stresses were fuelled by crippling shyness.\n\nKelly lives with her family near Leuven (pictured) \u2013 yet incredibly had not told her parents, identical twin sister or younger sibling of her plan\n\nThis was intensified by living in the shadow of a more extrovert twin sister \u2013 which allowed Kelly to withdraw into a shell \u2013 and frequently changing schools as the family moved between rented homes. The twins were often identically dressed, even as teenagers, although their parents made some efforts to encourage their individuality.\n\n\u2018My sister did everything, such as making friends for us, so I never really had to do these things for myself. It felt like we belonged together, although I now see we were very different.\n\n\u2018But we were always together. Then when we were separated at school, I found it difficult.\u2019\n\nKelly focused her efforts on working hard and trying to please her teachers. But she says she always felt lonely and unhappy \u2013 and even when she did bond with new friends, it seemed as if they were drawn to her vivacious sister. \u2018I tried telling her once how I felt, that it felt like she stole away my friends. I don\u2019t think she understood.\u2019\n\nI asked if she had ever been to a party? \u2018Yes, I went once and it was awful,\u2019 she replied. She tried asking a few friends to her house for a sleepover around the same time, when she was 16. \u2018But only one came, so I felt rebuffed.\u2019\n\nThese are, of course, standard social anxieties for many teenagers. And for all her doubts and insecurities, I found Kelly to be very affable and straightforward \u2013 despite evident anger beneath the surface \u2013 once she began to relax during our discussion. Yet trust is clearly an issue after her disruptive upbringing. So despite pouring out her upsetting life story in detail, she was scared to tell me she had a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder for fear that it would change my opinion of her.\n\nI told her it was hard to understand such psychiatric trauma for those that do not suffer.\n\n\u2018It is like physical pain,\u2019 Kelly replied, holding both tightly clenched fists to her heart. \u2018It feels like I am breaking apart.\u2019\n\nThings began to spiral out of control at the age of 18 after the death of a beloved grandparent combined with a feeling of betrayal by a female psychologist she had grown to trust. \u2018I could not go to classes. I would sit in the toilet all day crying.\u2019\n\nTo win the right to die, Kelly (pictured) \u2013 who has been unable to work since leaving school beyond a bit of babysitting \u2013 needs backing from two psychiatrists and one other doctor\n\nKelly attempted suicide, was hospitalised, suffered eating disorders and started to self-harm.\n\n\u2018It was easier to feel the pain from self-harm then the pain in my head. At least the pain from self-harm goes away, unlike the pain inside that is always there.\u2019\n\nShe decided to apply for euthanasia after learning it was lawful and possible from a psychologist in the hospital.\n\n\u2018I felt \u201cyes\u201d,\u2019 she said, pumping her fist as she recalled the moment. \u2018I immediately went and looked up all the information I could find.\u2019\n\nTo win the right to die, Kelly \u2013 who has been unable to work since leaving school beyond a bit of babysitting \u2013 needs backing from two psychiatrists and one other doctor. They must agree her mental pain is unbearable and untreatable.\n\nShe applied seven months ago and is being assessed by Joris Vandenberghe, a local professor who has helped draft stricter rules for psychiatrists amid concerns that some patients died despite treatment options being available.\n\nIn the end, only her father attended the meeting on Friday with her doctor to break the news.\n\n\u2018My father was very shocked, he cried and I grabbed him. I was almost crying, too. It was very moving but also painful to see him like that,\u2019 she said.\n\nVandenberghe declined to discuss Kelly\u2019s case.\n\nBut he recently wrote an academic article admitting that Belgium\u2019s policy was \u2018highly controversial and raises difficult ethical and clinical issues\u2019.\n\nHe argued its laws had failed to ensure \u2018sufficient checks and balances to promote reluctance to act on a patient\u2019s death-wish\u2019, concluding that more investment in mental healthcare could prevent some, but not all, of the demand for euthanasia from distressed patients.\n\nLast year it emerged that three Flemish doctors, including a high-profile psychiatrist accused of being behind almost half the cases of euthanasia for mental health disorders, were being investigated on suspicion of \u2018poisoning\u2019 a woman who had autism.\n\nKelly attends a fortnightly group session with five others undergoing this vetting process where she met her boyfriend Bregt, 44, a father-of-two who grew up in an abusive and dysfunctional household, leaving him suffering post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\u2018I have always felt I don\u2019t belong, that I don\u2019t want to be here. I try to conform as wanted by society but it does not work,\u2019 he said. \u2018There is this constant feeling of being an alien, a freak.\u2019\n\nThe pair have discussed whether they should die together if they gain consent, but are conflicted. Bregt, a former social worker, fears he will not have the strength to wait. Kelly admits that while she would like to \u2018do it\u2019 together it might upset her family.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want my family there. I have felt so lonely for so long, why should I have people with me when I die? I\u2019m just going to sleep \u2013 woo-hoh!\u2019 she added with a smile.\n\nThe group sessions are run by Ann Callebert, a psychologist who has had her own mental health struggles, including feeling suicidal. She said: \u2018My aim is to show life can be bearable, to find ways to enjoy life, since they have the feeling it is too painful.\u2019\n\nShe admits it is difficult when patients go on to be killed by euthanasia \u2013 and that Kelly, the youngest to join the group, has got under her skin.\n\n\u2018I can feel her suffering. I would not want to be in her head.\u2019\n\nSo does she want Kelly to win consent to die?\n\n\u2018That is difficult. On one side there is the constant hope she can make something from life, something to give meaning. But then I can see her daily fight and I would love to find a way to take away the pain.\u2019\n\nAs Callebert says, Kelly is \u2018a tough girl\u2019.\n\nIt was disturbing to talk in such an open manner about the possible death of someone so friendly and physically in their prime. But equally, her intense mental difficulties were clear to see.\n\nKelly has contemplated what she will do if denied euthanasia. \u2018First I will try to find another doctor, but if that does not happen then I will give up. That means suicide.\u2019\n\nLast year I interviewed a Belgian woman with autism left seriously traumatised after being locked up in psychiatric units during childhood. She had won the right to die \u2013 but since being granted control over her death had stopped thinking about suicide.\n\nSo could this happen to you, I asked Kelly.\n\nCould you possibly find any happiness in the future?\n\nShe shakes her head in response, before saying quietly: \u2018Happy days in my life? Never, seriously never. I want this all to end.\u2019\n\nAs she left with Bregt, I gave her a big hug and hoped that she was wrong.", "description": "Kelly, 23, from Leuven, Belgium, has long suffered with mental health problems.
