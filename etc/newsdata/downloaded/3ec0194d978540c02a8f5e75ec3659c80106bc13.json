Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has called President Donald Trump\u2019s public call for China to investigate Joe Biden and his son \u201cstupid.\" Buzz60\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump reached back into racial history Tuesday for a new description of the impeachment inquiry focused on him.\n\n\"A lynching.\"\n\n\"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump has attacked House Democrats' ongoing impeachment probe as political. But Tuesday was the first time he used the term 'lynching.'\n\nIn general, a lynching is the hanging of an accused person without benefit of a trial \u2013 a fate often visited on black Americans in the pre-civil rights era.\n\nThe NAACP reports that, between 1882 and 1968, there were 4,743 lynchings in the United States, and, of these, \"3,446 were black.\"\n\nIn the decades following the Civil War, said the NAACP history, \"lynchings were becoming a popular way of resolving some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks.\"\n\nImpeachment inquiry: Diplomat who called Trump Ukraine policy 'crazy' to testify in impeachment probe\n\nAfrican-American lawmakers took Trump to task over the lynching post.\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with you?\" tweeted Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. \"Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\"\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., who had the tweet read to him during an interview on CNN said: \"That is one word no president ought to apply to himself. You know, I've studied presidential history quite a bit, and I don't know if we've ever seen anything quite like this.\"\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating Trump for impeachment over a whistleblower complaint that accused Trump of asking a foreign country \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 to investigate one of his domestic political opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAs part of a series of familiar-looking tweets decrying the investigation as political, Trump also made a threat against future Democratic presidents.\n\n\"So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\" Trump said.\n\nThe tweet came a day after Trump complained that Republicans have not been aggressive enough in defending him.\n\n\"Republicans have to get tougher and fight,\" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. \"We have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the (2020) election.\"\n\nImpeachment inquiry: Week 5 questions\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/22/donald-trump-calls-impeachment-inquiry-lynching-attacks-democrats/4060850002/", "description": "\"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching,\" Trump wrote in a Tuesday tweet.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Published A.M.
