That\u2019s the ultimate, and that\u2019s what we have, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nTrump: \"I'm not sure that I've ever heard of a Category 5.\"\n\n\n\nThis is the fourth Category 5 hurricane to strike the United States during his presidency.

That same month, Hurricane Maria, which was also initially ranked Category 5, hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, leaving behind damage from which the island has yet to fully recover as it waits on further disaster relief funding from Congress.\n\nIn October 2018, Hurricane Michael became the first Category 5 storm to strike the country since 1992.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the first time Trump\u2019s memory has apparently short-circuited. On two separate occasions in September 2017, the president said he \u201cnever even knew a Category 5 existed\u201d and that no one had ever \u201cseen anything like that.\u201d\n\nThe following month, he erroneously claimed that throughout history, a storm of that intensity had never hit land.\n\nIn May of this year, he again said he hadn\u2019t heard of a Category 5 storm, calling it \u201cbig stuff.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump on the existence of Category 5 hurricanes, 2017-2019. pic.twitter.com/IRRny20hfp \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 1, 2019\n\nDorian is expected to begin moving along the Florida coast on Tuesday.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian is the fourth storm of that magnitude to develop during his presidency.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6c0d86240000330071c3d9.jpeg?cache=m2ixxg11mq&ops=1778_1000"}
