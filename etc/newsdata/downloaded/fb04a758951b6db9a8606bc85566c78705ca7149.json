According to police, he used only his brain to take the information.\n\nYusuke Taniguchi, 34, was arrested Thursday when police said they discovered he used the stolen information to purchase bags worth an estimated $2,600 in March, according to CNN. The police intercepted that order and delivered Taniguchi\u2019s bags themselves to catch the alleged thief, according to Vice.\n\nPeople close to the investigation have told news media that Taniguchi has a \u201cphotographic memory.\u201d Police say the part-time cashier retained customer credit card information in the short amount of time it took for them to purchase their goods, according to SoraNews24. He remembered all the details until he was able to write down the information, which he would later use to shop online, police said.\n\nBut science doesn\u2019t really back the claims of his photographic memory.\n\nScientists have not found evidence of photographic memories, but there are people with very good memories who can recall information in astounding detail \u2014 an eidetic memory \u2014 according to Daniel Burns, a professor of psychology at Union College in New York.\n\nMost people conflate having an eidetic memory with a photographic memory, but scientists who study memory draw a hard line between the two, he said. A person with an eidetic memory is able to recall an image in great detail after seeing it once, with the ability to remember the image up to four minutes. But the eidetic image is not identical even though it has many perceptual similarities, according to Burns. Furthermore, eidetic memory is most commonly found in children between the ages of 6 and 12, and it\u2019s hardly ever found in adults, according to research.\n\n\u201cIn our mind, a \u2018photographic memory\u2019 is being able to look at something and days later call up a picture that\u2019s identical to the actual image,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to exist.\u201d\n\nRemembering the world in such vivid detail would make it difficult to operate in daily life, according to Jennifer Coane, an associate professor of psychology at Colby College in Maine. \u201cYou could never be able to erase anything from your mind, because everything would pile up,\u201d she said, pointing to research that shows how forgetting information can be useful to learning.\n\nPolice have not said how much time it took Taniguchi to allegedly see, remember and write down the credit information in his notebook.\n\nCoane said it\u2019s likely the alleged thief trained himself to learn sequences of numbers with a high degree of accuracy, given how rare photographic and eidetic memory are. Ancient Greeks and others used a method called loci, which entails associating content to be remembered with certain places.\n\nMemory competitions, such as the World Memory Championships or the USA Memory Championships, show how training the brain can help people accomplish amazing feats of memory, Coane said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people just train much like a gymnast trains or an expert violinist,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can train yourself to be an expert memorizer.\u201d\n\nAlthough police are still investigating the scope of Taniguchi\u2019s alleged crimes, how he executed his transgressions isn\u2019t special, according to Burns.\n\n\u201cIf you want to memorize credit card numbers, you can do it, too,\u201d he joked.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs humans shaped dogs\u2019 bodies, we also altered their brains\n\nScientists rethink Alzheimer\u2019s, diversifying the drug search\n\nChildren, tackle football and the possible dangers of brain diseases", "description": "A cashier in Japan stole credit card information from 1,300 customers using his \"photographic' memory.\" Experts think he just has good memory.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum", "September At Pm", "Lateshia Beachum Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
