It is a year since the great American left Arthur Ashe Stadium in tears, a broken champion who could do little but surrender to her own frailties and the rock-solid tennis of Naomi Osaka, a teenager who would rise further then fall in the almost inevitable narrative of their sport.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov\u2019s US Open resurgence to be tested by fast-rising Medvedev Read more\n\nWhen Williams reaches for the 24th major of her career on Saturday she will see across the net another prodigy, the ridiculously talented Bianca Andreescu of Canada. It promises to be a struggle as titanic as any Willliams has had since she won her first match here 21 years ago, in three sets against the Australian, Nicole Pratt.\n\nShe could not recall that match when asked about it earlier in the week, and meant no disrespect to a fellow professional. But there have been so many triumphs, and quite a few disasters in a career like no other. When she saw off the reduced challenge of the fifth seed Elina Svitolina in straight sets on Thursday, she registered her 101st victory at her home tournament.\n\nBut anyone remotely familiar with her career will know that Flushing Meadows has not always embraced Williams like a champion should be. Her meltdown against Osaka last year was one of several, a few of which have cost her not only a win but peace of mind. There have been times in her career and life when she has flirted with total breakdown, yet has not stayed down.\n\nWhen she was striving for a calender grand slam in 2015, her emotions bubbled up like a volcano and she lost in the semi-finals to the veteran Italian doubles specialist, Roberta Vinci.\n\nIn 2011, she had another attack of nerves when the Australian, Samantha Stosur, cashed in here at the conclusion of the fortnight of her career, ignoring the distraction of Williams\u2019s verbal exertions on serve, as well as her verbal abuse of the chair umpire, which cost her a warning and a penalty \u2013 and ultimately the match. Neither Vinci nor Stosur are in her class, yet they beat her, as have others.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bianca Andreescu consoles Serena Williams after Williams had to retire from the final of the Rogers Cup.

On Thursday night she came back from the brink of defeat to beat Belinca Bencic in two sets of the most compelling tennis, rich in exquisite ground strokes that singed the surface of the most dramatic workplace in the sport. As 24,000 fans leaned forward uncertain of what to expect next, she stole the result from Bencic, who led handily in her own second-set comeback, but found her opponent too strong and determined.\n\nThere is a look about Andreescu that borders on the frightening. Her gaze is as hard as her forehand. She carries muscle physically and mentally. She will be the most formidable foe in Saturday\u2019s final. Asked about the challenge in front of her, she said \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have believed [anyone who told her a year ago she would be in the final of the US Open against Williams]. I was ranked, like, outside 150. It\u2019s just crazy what a year can do.\u201d\n\nThen, tellingly, she added \u201cIf someone would have said that a couple weeks ago, I think I would have believed them.\u201d\n\nThat is the power of innocence. Andreescu believes. Yet nearly every respected observer expects Williams to prevail. It is a judgment built on history, and a valid one if we are to stand back and look at not only her record but her astonishing ability. She has won 23 majors, but not a single tournament since she gave birth for the first time two years ago. That would indicate an understandable decline. But, like Ali, she encourages dreaming. She makes the impossible not only likely but probable.\n\nHer admirers are not alone in their assessment. \u201cTo be in yet another final, it seems honestly crazy,\u201d she said after beating Svitolina. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really expect too much less.\u201d\n\nNow she has to deliver. Williams sets impossibly high standards. Anyone who witnessed her dismantling of Svitolina\u2019s normally reliable game would reckon it was a convincing performance. She said, however: \u201cI think today was solid ... it definitely wasn\u2019t my best tennis.\u201d\n\nSvitolina agreed, but observed: \u201cWhat she does and what she\u2019s achieved, it\u2019s something unbelievable. Everyone dreams about it, [but] for now, it\u2019s only she who can do it.\u201d\n\nWe should strap ourselves in for an epic conclusion to the fortnight. If Williams equals Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 majors it will be no more than she deserves. Andreescu has all of that to look forward to.", "description": "One year on from her career low point against Naomi Osaka the former champion takes on yet another prodigy in Bianca Andreescu", "authors": ["Kevin Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e486bed89f38d44bb962a06b5f1b635f64d15c6c/0_53_3021_1813/master/3021.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69be0fe9245741972c5c1e06524e0f83", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
