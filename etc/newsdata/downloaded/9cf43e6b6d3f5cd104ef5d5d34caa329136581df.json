The Supreme Court Will Decide", "language": "en", "text": "Gerald Bostock, who said he lost his job after joining a gay softball league, at his home in Atlanta, Sept. 19, 2019. (Audra Melton/The New York Times)\n\nATLANTA \u2014 The Supreme Court has delivered a remarkable series of victories to the gay rights movement over the last two decades, culminating in a ruling that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. But in more than half the states, someone can still be fired for being gay.\n\nEarly in its new term, on Oct. 8, the court will consider whether an existing federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, guarantees nationwide protection from workplace discrimination to gay and transgender people, even in states that offer no protections right now.\n\nIt will be the court\u2019s first case on LGBT rights since the retirement last year of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinions in all four of the court\u2019s major gay rights decisions. And without Kennedy, who joined four liberals in the 5-4 ruling in the marriage case, the workers who sued their employers in the three cases before the court may face an uphill fight.\n\n\u201cNow that we don\u2019t have Kennedy on the court, it would be a stretch to find a fifth vote in favor of any of these claims that are coming to the court,\u201d said Katherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia and the author of \u201cWedlocked: The Perils of Marriage Equality.\u201d\n\nShe added that lawyers working to expand gay rights might have focused too narrowly on the right to marry. \u201cThe gay rights movement became the marriage rights movement,\u201d she said, \u201cand we lost sight of the larger dynamics and structures of homophobia.\u201d\n\nOther experts said the court should have little trouble ruling for the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cLesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans continue to face widespread job discrimination because of their same-sex attraction or sex identities,\u201d said William N. Eskridge Jr., a law professor at Yale and the author of an article in The Yale Law Journal on Title VII\u2019s statutory history. \u201cIf the justices take seriously the text of Title VII and their own precedents, LGBT Americans will enjoy the same job protections as other groups.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s earlier gay rights rulings were grounded in constitutional law. Romer v. Evans, in 1996, struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment that had banned laws protecting gay men and lesbians. Lawrence v. Texas, in 2003, struck down laws making gay sex a crime. United States v. Windsor, in 2013, overturned a ban on federal benefits for married same-sex couples.\n\nAnd Obergefell v. Hodges, in 2015, struck down state bans on same-sex marriage, ruling that the Constitution guarantees a right to such unions.\n\nThe new cases, by contrast, concern statutory interpretation, not constitutional law.\n\nThe question for the justices is whether the landmark 1964 law\u2019s prohibition of sex discrimination encompasses discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Lawyers for the gay and transgender plaintiffs say it does. Lawyers for the defendants and the Trump administration, which has filed briefs supporting the employers, say it does not.\n\nThe common understanding of sex discrimination in 1964 was bias against women or men, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote. It did not encompass discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n\u201cThe ordinary meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 is biologically male or female,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt does not include sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nIn response, lawyers for one of the plaintiffs, Gerald Bostock, wrote that \u201ca person\u2019s sexual orientation is a sex-based classification because it cannot be defined without reference to his sex.\u201d\n\nBostock, who spent a decade building a government program to help neglected and abused children in Clayton County, Georgia, just south of Atlanta, said his story illustrated the gaps in protection for gay workers.\n\n\u201cEverything was going amazingly,\u201d he said in an interview in his home. \u201cThen I decided to join a gay recreational softball league.\u201d\n\nHe played catcher and first base for his team, the Honey Badgers, in the Hotlanta Softball League. A few months later, the county fired him for \u201cconduct unbecoming a county employee.\u201d\n\nBostock\u2019s case is at an early stage, and the reason for his dismissal is contested. His former employer has said it fired him after an audit indicated he had misused county funds, which Bostock denies.\n\nIn an email, Jack R. Hancock, a lawyer for the county, said, \u201cMr. Bostock\u2019s sexual orientation had nothing to do with his termination.\u201d", "description": "ATLANTA -- The Supreme Court has delivered a remarkable series of victories to the gay rights movement over the last two decades, culminating in a ruling that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.
