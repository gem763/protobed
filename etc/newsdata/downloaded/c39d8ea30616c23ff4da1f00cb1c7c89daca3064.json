Dunn touted Biden\u2019s performance, saying that Biden\u2019s persona on Thursday was that of \u201cJoe Biden the statesman,\u201d citing his empathy toward other candidates on stage over a series of issues.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHis final answer on resilience really did illustrate why people really have a real connection with Vice President Biden and why they feel he gets their lives and why they could trust him,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders added that \u201cvoters know Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know him, they know his record, they know he\u2019s been there for them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the asserting anything that flies in the face of what the voters know to be true themselves because of their experience with Vice President Biden just won\u2019t stick.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden's campaign offered a warning to the former vice president's 2020 Democratic primary rivals after Thursday night\u2019s debate: \u201cAttacking Joe Biden is not the way to advance yourself in the polls.\u201d", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
