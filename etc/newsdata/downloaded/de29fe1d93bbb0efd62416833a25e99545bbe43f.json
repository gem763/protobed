My question is, \u2018Will they bring us closer to God or replace him?'\n\nThe bishop claimed that Christian Mindfulness is 'meditation on Christ' which empties the mind of 'everything unnecessary' in order to become 'aware of the presence and love of Christ'.\n\nWhile he also quoted Pope Francis that practices like yoga are 'not capable of opening our hearts up to God'.\n\nThe bishop added how people can 'take a million courses in spirituality' but this activity 'will never be able to give you freedom', echoing Pope Francis's speech in 2015.\n\nHe said Pope Francis's philosophy was in keeping with Ireland's Grow In Love programme. This touches on Christian doctrine, Scripture, morality and prayer.\n\nTeacher's were reminded that October is the 'month of the Rosary' and they should each pray in a bid to get closer to Jesus, in the letter.\n\nThe full letter which Bishop Cullinan sent to teachers and schools across Waterford City and the County, Ireland, on October 10. In the document, he says Christian Mindfulness is 'meditation on Christ' which empties the mind of 'everything unnecessary' in order to become 'aware of the presence and love of Christ' and yoga is not capable of this, in a bid to discourage the latter's teaching in Ireland's schools\n\nBut the primary school curriculum allows a degree of flexibility about how its implemented, according to the Irish National Teachers Organisation, who hit-back at his view.\n\nJohn Stokes, a yoga instructor in Waterford, said the practice of yoga, meditation and mindfulness should be 'embraced' in 'an age where children are really suffering from anxiety and stress'.\n\nSeed and Blossoms yoga wrote on Facebook: 'There is no dogma taught in our classes and Yoga in it\u2019s truest sense is a movement and breath awareness practice for health and wellbeing.'\n\nHe cited Pope Francis who said people can 'take a million courses in spirituality' but this activity 'will never be able to give you freedom' (pictured at the Vatican, today)\n\nThey said 'here's to tolerance, love and unity' and invited him to a one-to-one yoga session or class of his choice' at their Wellness Centre in Youghal, Ireland.\n\nThe Irish National Teachers Organisation said the primary school curriculum allows schools a certain amount of flexibility and autonomy with regard to its implementation.\n\nIn a statement to the Irish Times, they said the schools 'are best placed' to make the decisions about how the subjects are taught, taking into consideration the 'school culture, ethos and needs of the pupils'.\n\nBishop of Waterford and Lismore Phonsie Cullinan has issued an apology after warning that a cervical cancer vaccine could lead to promiscuity\n\nThis is not the first time Bishop Cullinan has received backlash for his views as he said he was to establish a 'delivery ministry' group to rid people of the devil through exorcism, last year.\n\nHe also claimed the cervical cancer vaccine could lead to promiscuity in 2017.\n\nThe bishop said the vaccine 'lulls girls into false sense of security' and encourages sexual activity, adding: 'Prevention, the number one and most effective protection, is abstinence. A good old traditional value.'\n\nHe later apologised and admitted he was not fully informed about the vaccination programme. Cullinan's 'intention was solely motivated to protect people from HPV'.\n\nBishop Cullinan has been approached for comment by MailOnline.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bishop Alphonsus Cullinan ordered schools across Waterford City and County, Ireland, to ban yoga, in letter on October 10.
