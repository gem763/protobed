[Teens] find it very difficult to get to sleep and hard to wake up in the morning,\" advises Dr Nicholas Gant of the University of Auckland.\n\n\"There would be a tendency for impulsiveness, explosive behaviour... a strong predisposition for reckless behaviour,\" says Professor Hughes.\n\nThe episode also flags a US study which found that risky behaviour was associated with high levels of energy drink consumption.\n\nAlso see: Earlier bedtime happier teens\n\nNo limits\n\nIn South Africa, the law stipulates that energy drink products containing more than 150mg per litre must be clearly labelled as \u201chigh caffeine content\u201d, but there is no law limiting the amount of caffeine manufacturers are allowed to put in their drinks.\n\nAnd with no particular stipulations around how this label is presented, consumers may not be aware the warning exists, since there are \"no colour- or type-setting restrictions, [which allows] producers to obscure this warning from potential buyers through careful package design.\"\n\nSweet poison: no more than 6 teaspoons per day!\n\nWhile caffeine poses one threat, sugar poses another.\n\n\"The high energy is really just referring to a lot of high sugar in the product, so at the end of the day they're not going to say it's a high sugar drink... high energy sounds a whole lot better,\" comments consumer rights expert, Belinda Allan.\n\nThe episode reveals that consumers are getting up to 16 teaspoons of sugar per drink, an amount far exceeding the recommended dose for children.\n\nAccording to the WHO, poor diet and insufficient physical activity is at the heart of deaths by heart attack, stroke, cancer, and diabetes, and recommends a maximum of 6 teaspoons of sugar per day for children.\n\nAnother important factor raised in episode is that the body is less able to detect sugar when it comes in liquid form.\n\n\"The appetite centres in the brain do not recognise those liquid calories in sugar,\" says Professor Jim Mann of the University of Otago.\n\nThis places them at risk of putting on excessive weight, which may lead to life-threatening conditions later on, including diabetes and cancer.\n\nA lose-lose situation all round, it would seem.\n\nWhat are your rules around your children consuming energy drinks?
