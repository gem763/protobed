Something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby!'\n\nWoah: WAG Nicola McLean has hit out at Coleen Rooney for publicly accusing pregnant Rebekah Vardy of leaking stories about her to the press\n\nColeen's dramatic revelation enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Rebekah, who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have access to her Instagram account.\n\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy has now given an interview with The Daily Mail, in which she insisted arguing with Coleen is akin to rowing 'with a pigeon'.\n\nSince Rebekah's explosive interview, Nicola, who shares the same agent as WAG Rebekah, has come out in protection of her pal, as she said: 'I\u2019ve not spoken to her today but you can imagine how she is absolutely devastated...\n\n'Absolutely forget who it is - a celeb, a WAG, a normal person. Pregnancy. We all know stress can cause so much upset. We've just had a report from psychiatrists that said that it can cause stress on the brain.'\n\nGot her back: Nicola, who is married to footballer Tom Williams, has been friends with Rebakah for years and the duo share the same agent (the duo pictured together in October 2018)\n\nNot ok... Appearing on This Morning on Friday, Nicola said: 'Coleen doing this is not okay, as a mother its not okay. She should come out here, until she's proven guilty'\n\nShocking: Nicola launched a scathing attack on Coleen during an impassioned appearance\n\nOn attacking a pregnant woman, she said: 'I disagree with [what she's done]. I don\u2019t think she knows it's Rebekah and I think exactly she\u2019s seven months pregnant, it\u2019s so hypocritical for a show to promote mental health well-being...\n\n'This could have waited, Coleen said it\u2019s been going on for however many years then she should have waited\u2026 regardless we're talking about a pregnant woman...\n\n'You know what - regardless - it's Coleen's basement got flooded ,or something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby'.\n\nExplosive: The group were locking horns over the shock argument between the WAGs\n\nShock: While she appeared on the show, Coleen was spotted emerging from her Cheshire home\n\nHeading out: She cut a low-key figure while she was being slammed on TV\n\nShock: On Thursday, Rebekah slammed trolls who wished her unborn baby would die in the wake of her Coleen story leaking scandal. Nicola later came out in support of her\n\nShe pushed: 'If Dr. Ranj was here now he'd be saying exactly the same thing as me, you should protect yourself if you\u2019re pregnant regardless of if it\u2019s the fifth baby...\n\n'I\u2019m not saying you should mollycoddle someone. She could have stopped it, she didn\u2019t need to do this. I don\u2019t know Coleen, I don\u2019t know her but as a mother and someone in this industry for a long time she knows what happens...\n\n'She knew and did this to a pregnant woman. If someone caused your daughter this level of stress, we all have to have compassion of the fact regardless of how many pregnancies she's had. We've got someone who is seven months pregnant receiving death threats, saying they hope her unborn baby dies'.\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these shock claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah's account\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation - she also slammed her for going public when she is heavily pregnant\n\nAside from the comments about Rebekah, Nicola then said: 'She\u2019s used to being betrayed...', in what appeared to be a dig at some of the tempestuous stages in Coleen's marriage involving husband Wayne's indiscretions.\n\nRebekah previously slammed trolls who have wished her unborn baby would die in the wake of the leaking scandal.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Wednesday evening, Rebekah shared a screenshot of an Instagram message sent to her by a follower who penned: 'F**k u dirty sly c**t I hope that baby dies within you B***H'.\n\nNicola, who is the wife of former Arizona United SC star Tom Williams went on: 'I\u2019ve been reading [the trolling] personally, it's horrific. [They say] \"I hope the unborn baby dies, hope they both die\", this level of abuse is horrific especially if you\u2019re pregnant'.\n\nHitting back: Nicola has now come out in protection of the accused, as he said: 'I\u2019ve not spoken to her today but you can imagine how she is absolutely devastated'\n\nOn the public not liking her pal, Nicola said: 'People don\u2019t like her as much as they like Coleen, that just proves my point, it's okay it's happening because Rebekah Vardy rubs people the wrong way...\n\n'If you\u2019re an outspoken strong female people aren\u2019t going to like you. I like her.'\n\nIt has been revealed that Rebekah has hired a team of forensic IT experts to prove her innocence after Coleen accused her of selling stories to the press through information she obtained from her private Instagram.\n\nA spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'\n\nThe happy couple: Aside from the comments about Rebekah, Nicola then said: 'She\u2019s used to being betrayed...', in what appeared to be a dig at some of the tempestuous stages in Coleen's marriage involving husband Wayne's indiscretions (pictured in 2015)\n\nFans have also praised Rooney \u2013 calling her \u2018Wagatha Christie\u2019 - for the sensational way in which she revealed Vardy was the alleged culprit by concluding her post with a thriller-worthy 'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nThe saga began when Coleen took to social media to reveal she had suspected someone close to her had been betraying her for years and she had conclusive proof that her friend Rebekah was the guilty party.\n\nColeen admitted that stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection were only viewed by Rebekah and these were subsequently followed by media outlets, including MailOnline.\n\nThe Sun has since removed their story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.", "description": "In what has become a War of the WAGs,\u00a0Coleen, 33, released an incredible social media statement aimed at Rebekah, 37, on Wednesday which revealed she set up an elaborate sting", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19583986-0-image-a-79_1570791528053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
