Bank of Russia Hints at Fourth Consecutive Rate Cut in October\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Russia signaled that it may cut the key interest rate again later in October as annual inflation slowed to the central bank\u2019s target level of 4%.\n\nThe central bank said after it cut rates in September that more easing is probable at one of its next three meetings.\n\n\u201cLooking now, although there are a lot of one-off factors, we see inflation easing,\u201d First Deputy Governor Ksenia Yudaeva told reporters in Moscow on Friday. \u201cOverall risks are either balanced or declining. Financial markets risks are also under control.\u201d\n\nAfter 75 basis points of easing this year, Russia still has one of the highest real interest rates in emerging markets, and high borrowing costs are taking their toll on growth. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) warned this week that the central bank needs to cut rates more aggressively.\n\n\u201cPolicy makers need to acknowledge that it\u2019s also a problem if inflation falls below target,\u201d said Clemens Grafe, a Moscow-based economist at Goldman. \u201cThey always want to be on the cautious side and build buffers.\u201d\n\nBefore Yudaeva\u2019s comments just three of 18 analysts in another Bloomberg survey were forecasting a 25 basis-point cut at the central bank\u2019s next rates meeting on Oct. 25, with the rest expecting no change. One economist switched their forecast to a cut on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe central bank needs clarity on budget spending plans for the next year in order to make its decision on future rate cuts, Yudaeva said earlier on Friday. A likely jump in spending at the end of 2019 will feed into this year\u2019s inflation numbers, she said.\n\nThe Economy Ministry, which is pushing for deeper cuts, estimates that inflation could decelerate to below 3% next year, well below a central bank forecast that it will stay near the current level.\n\nRUSSIA REACT: Sliding Inflation Keeps October Live for Rate Cut\n\nStill, when inflation has fallen below target in recent years, Nabiullina has remained cautious with rate cuts. Inflation was below 4% for nearly a year in 2017-2018 and went as low as 2.2%, but the central bank kept rates above 7.25%.\n\n\u201cThe central bank still doesn\u2019t trust that it has enough credibility among investors and the population,\u201d Grafe said.", "description": "Bank of Russia Hints at Fourth Consecutive Rate Cut in October", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC2D0B0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
