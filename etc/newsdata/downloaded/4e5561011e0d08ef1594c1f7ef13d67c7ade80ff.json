She followed a par at the ninth with a birdie at the 10th before the magic began to fade.\n\n\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t feel like I was doing much different, just the putts were going in,\u201d Green said. \u201cHaving my brother on the bag kept me calm. We were just, like, let\u2019s play smart, give ourselves some good looks, and they were just all going in.\u201d\n\nGreen goes into Sunday\u2019s final round with a one-stroke lead over fellow American Cheyenne Knight, a rookie from Texas who capped her four-under 67 with her fifth birdie of the day at 18 to stand alone in second.\n\nAmerican Brittany Altomare, who shared the overnight lead with Knight and Canadian Alena Sharp, carded a 68 for 201, where she was joined by Katherine Perry (66).\n\nGreen said thoughts of a sub-60 round first flitted through her mind at the seventh when she thought \u201cWow, I\u2019ve only had one par.\u201d\n\nThat escalated to \u201cOh my gosh\u201d when she realized she\u2019d played 10 holes with only two pars but she told herself to \u201cforget about it.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s my time to shoot in the 50s it\u2019ll happen,\u201d she told herself. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t. I was happy with how things went.\u201d\n\nThree pars from the 11th through the 13th were followed by back-to-back bogeys at 14 and 15.\n\nA long par save at 16 \u201cwas big for my soul\u201d said Green, who pulled back a shot with an 18-foot birdie putt at the 17th.\n\nGreen, seeking her first LPGA Tour title, has made no secret of the fact that she struggled to get past her final-round failure at the US Women\u2019s Open.\n\nShe went into Sunday one shot off the lead but had three bogeys on the back nine on the way to a 74 that dropped her into a tie for fifth.\n\nSince that week she has missed six of 11 cuts and finished in the top 25 just once.\n\n\u201cI think about that Open almost every day,\u201d she said this week. \u201cThat was a tough one for me. People say, \u2018Oh, great top-five,\u2019 but in my heart, I won that thing.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot, just to stay patient. And there\u2019s more to life than golf.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Jaye Marie Green birdied eight of the first 10 holes on the way to a sensational seven-under par 64 on Saturday and a one-shot", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/962ec6_hot-start-american-jaye-marie-green-birdied-her-10-holes-on-way-lead-in-lpga-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
