It also meant leaving behind an unworkable strategy in Syria, started under one reluctant president (Obama) and haphazardly maintained by another (Trump), Kathy Gilsinan reports.\n\n+ \u201cThis policy abandonment \u2026 will severely damage American credibility and reliability in any future fights where we need strong allies,\u201d write General Joseph Votel and Elizabeth Dent. (Do their names sound familiar? Votel was commander of CENTOM from 2016 and 2019, and Dent is a counterterrorism expert who\u2019s worked for U.S. Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.)\n\nOn the Supreme Court, back in session this week: Experts are eyeing several cases that will face a Court with an ideological makeup markedly different from just a few years ago.\n\n+ Three alleged wrongful-termination cases arrive at the Court. Emma Green speaks to legal experts on how the legal arguments might play out.\n\n+ The Court\u2019s decision on June Medical Services v. Gee doesn\u2019t \u201ctechnically threaten Roe v. Wade,\u201d Leah Litman argues, but \u201cno matter which path the Court takes, overruling Roe or limiting it into oblivion, the destination will be the same.\u201d\n\nOn a worrying public-health trend: Rates of STDs in the U.S. have risen for a fifth year straight, according to a new CDC report (a record high for combined cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia). The disappearance of strong local health departments certainly doesn\u2019t help.\n\nOur Reporters Are Also Reading\n\n\u2023 Inside the White House\u2019s Effort to Contain Ukraine Callout (Pamela Brown, Jeremy Diamond, Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak, CNN)\n\n\u2023 Elizabeth Warren Stands by Her Account of Being Pushed Out of Her First Teaching Job Because of Pregnancy (Zak Hudak and Bo Rickson, CBS News)\n\n\u2023 Inside Trump\u2019s Obsession with Polygraphs (Daniel Lippman, Politico)\n\nAbout us: The Atlantic\u2019s politics newsletter is a daily effort from our politics desk.
