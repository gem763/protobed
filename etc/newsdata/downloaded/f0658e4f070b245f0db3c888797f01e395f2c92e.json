Sophie Shotton, prosecuting, asked for another four charges of sexual assault to be left on file.\n\nJudge Christine Laing QC told him: 'Having now pleaded guilty, custody is inevitable and likely to be quite substantial.'\n\nThe court heard that Beagley's offending spanned much of his career, with the first indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14 taking place in 1997. Another girl aged under 13 was abused between 2006 and 2010.\n\nDetective Sergeant John Steven, of the East Sussex safeguarding investigations unit, said: 'Beagley was a trusted and well known man in his local community in East Sussex, and around the world in performing and teaching ballet.\n\nStephen Beagley performed with Freddie Mercury, memorably lifting the Queen singer into the air for a photograph during rehearsals (pictured)\n\n'He targeted the young girls he came into contact with, and abused them while they were at their most vulnerable, over many years. I am glad that the victims had the courage, strength and commitment to come forward and remain resilient through this investigation, ensuring the justice achieved today.'\n\nBeagley started dancing at the age of eight and joined the Royal Ballet School a year later.\n\nAt 17, he joined the Royal Ballet Company and became a principal dancer, an accolade he held for 14 years, performing for the Queen's silver jubilee gala in 1977.\n\nOne of the many highlights of Beagley's career was Sir Frederick Ashton's one-act ballet Rhapsody, created to mark the Queen Mother's 80th birthday.\n\nAt the last minute, before his trial, he admitted five counts of sexual assault, two charges of indecent assault and one of causing a child to engage in sexual activity\n\nIn 1982, he was nominated for an Olivier Award and for a Society of West End Theatre gong for outstanding performance for a dancer. Two years later he played the lead role in Cats, followed by a tour of Italy as Rocky in The Rocky Horror Show.\n\nBefore turning to teaching, he enjoyed an illustrious career in film and television, as well as on the stage, appearing alongside Joan Collins in the 1983 film Nutcracker and with dancer Wayne Sleep in the Hot Shoe Show for the BBC.\n\nIn 1989 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, starring in its record-breaking production of A Clockwork Orange and he briefly appeared in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.\n\nFor many years Beagley was a guest teacher and the head of adult ballet programme for the English National Ballet.\n\nIn 1994 he designed and built a ballet studio in Japan, teaching students from the age of three.\n\nHe also taught at the Boston Ballet, Scottish Ballet, Hong Kong Ballet, and worked with ballet students in New Zealand, Shanghai, America, Italy.\n\nHe most recently worked with the Bangkok City Ballet as artistic director.\n\nYesterday Beagley, wearing a grey shirt and grey V-neck jumper, spoke only to confirm his name and the guilty pleas.\n\nHe showed no emotion as he was remanded into custody until a sentencing hearing next month.\n\nDetective Sergeant Steven said: 'This investigation of historic allegations was carried out by experienced detectives, working alongside the victims in this case with the support of partner agencies.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Stephen Beagley, 62, was one of Britain's leading classical dancers in the 1970s and 1980s.
