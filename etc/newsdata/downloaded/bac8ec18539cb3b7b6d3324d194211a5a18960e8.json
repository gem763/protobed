The financial industry, notably, was one of Mr Biden's top donor groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Ms Warren criticised BAPCPA during the hearing because it allowed Enron to conduct its bankruptcy proceedings in Delaware, far away from its employees in Texas, making it incredibly difficult for those employees to challenge decisions on the future of their pension funds.\n\nMr Biden took offence to Ms Warren claiming that the Delaware proceedings made the bankruptcy process inaccessible, before engaging in a lengthy critique of her views during the proceeding.\n\n\u201cBankruptcy courts in Delaware are not open?\u201d Mr Biden asked her.\n\n\u201cThey are not open to employees of companies like Enron who cannot afford ...\u201d Ms Warren started, before Mr Biden cut her off.\n\n\u201cIn what sense do you mean open?\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a brief back and forth, she responded: \u201cEmployees of companies like Enron literally cannot go to Delaware and hire local counsel, which the Delaware bankruptcy court requires of them before they can make an appearance, and that effectively cuts thousands of small employees, pensioners, and local trade creditors out of the bankruptcy process. If they can\u2019t afford it, they are not there.\u201d\n\nMr Biden later complained: \u201cWe are going to ask the gas company, the drug store, the automobile dealer to pay for the broken system instead of having the nerve to come and say it is a moral obligation of a nation to pay for that broken system.\u201d\n\nMs Warren countered: \u201cUntil we fix the broken healthcare finance system, those families have to turn somewhere and that means now they turn as a last-ditch effort to the bankruptcy courts.\u201d\n\nFinally, Mr Biden said that Ms Warren was actually concerned with high rates charged by credit card companies, not by bankruptcy laws themselves.\n\n\u201cBut, senator, if you are not going to fix that problem, you can\u2019t take away the last shred of protection from these families,\u201d Ms Warren said.\n\n\u201cI got it, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are very good, professor.\u201d\n\nMs Warren has said that that exchange, and the passage of the bankruptcy bill \u2014 which proponents say has led to a dip in bankruptcy filings, and which opponents say only means people are putting off financial crisis and borrowing more \u2014 was a wakeup call.\n\nShe penned an op-ed two years later calling for the creation of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which led her to become an adviser in the Obama White House. During that time, she clashed with the administration frequently, before being pressured to run for Senate in Massachusetts when Barack Obama made it clear that he would not be nominating her to run the agency.\n\nAnd, just this year, after Mr Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Ms Warren did not shy away from their conflicts, and referenced the 2005 exchange itself.\n\n\u201cOur disagreement is a matter of public record,\u201d Ms Warren said. \u201cWhen the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hardworking families who were in bankruptcy because of medical problems, job losses, divorce and death in the family, there was nobody to stand up for them. I got in that fight because they just didn\u2019t have anyone, and Joe Biden was on the side of credit-card companies.\u201d", "description": "With Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren meeting for the first time as 2020 presidential candidates during the third Democratic debate stage in Houston, the stage will be set for the two leading contenders to dredge up a nearly two-decade beef over bankruptcy, consumer protection, and the question of who the US economy should work for in the end.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/18/elizabeth-warren-joe-biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
