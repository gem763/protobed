There is a strong chance \u2013 about 50 per cent in the betting \u2013 that it will deliver parliamentary arithmetic spookily similar to today\u2019s.\n\nIf so, what then? Imagine, if you\u2019ve the stomach, that at 10pm and 20 seconds on the night in question, John Curtice\u2019s exit poll flashes up: \u201cHung parliament: Conservatives largest party\u201d.\n\nWhere would we go from there?\n\nWhen you\u2019re in hell, said the man Boris Johnson claims with tragicomic chutzpah as his inspiration, keep on going. What Churchill didn\u2019t advise was descending deeper into it.\n\nThat will be the direction of travel if we land up with another minority Tory government. The new Commons would gather for ten minutes. By the time the house reassembled after the holidays, there would be several weeks until the next Brexit deadline on 31 January.\n\nWithout a healthy dose of acid, or with a potentially toxic overdose come to that, can you begin to hallucinate the Commons resolving the impasse that has paralysed it for 20 months and more in 20 days or less?\n\nAssuming it didn\u2019t, how confident are you that Emanuel Macron\u2019s patience, already close to snapping point, would extend to another extension?\n\nThe trajectory would be a corkscrew spin. No deal might be unavoidable.\n\nAlso trading at about even money on Betfair is a Tory majority. In that case, Johnson\u2019s surrender deal will pass. A granite-hard Brexit would permit Johnson, on behalf of the multibillionaire expat sponsors whose newspapers put him in power, to torch workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.\n\nDoes Jo Swinson trust this man with the NHS? Is she reassured by reports about secret conclaves between his government and US-based big pharma?\n\nGod alone knows what was in her mind, beyond rank opportunism, in gifting Johnson an election at colossal risk of delivering the diametric opposite outcome to the one she supposedly craves.\n\nCorbyn is excused his belated support for the election. Once it became inevitable, he had nothing to gain from opposing it other than looking churlish, bemused and impotent, and he banked that trifecta long ago. Since the SNP\u2019s ultimate goal is the independence made likelier by this election, their own opportunism at least makes long-term sense.\n\nBut Swinson? The Lib Dems may expect to recover a few dozen seats from the Tories in the south and southwest of England \u2013 but at what price next time round? It\u2019s a terrible shame there was no recent precedent to warn her what happens to her party when it enables the Conservatives to indulge their most brutish instincts.\n\nAgain for amnesiacs, there is no such thing as a single issue general election. Caught in the crossfire between parties with simplistic Brexit messages, and with none of its own a canvasser could explain on the doorstep in a nanosecond less than nine months, Labour will necessarily campaign on other matters.\n\nIts economic and social policies are broadly attractive, but its leader is historically unpopular and its messages are at grave risk of being drowned out.\n\nThis is not to discount the possibility that, in a six-week campaign against as grand a master of blundering disaster as Johnson, it will close the gap. Perhaps Nigel Farage won\u2019t be bought off, and will eat into the Tory vote with the ritual cry of betrayal.\n\nBut if Labour somehow becomes the largest party (a majority will require a biblical miracle), or repeats the near miss of 2017, it will be in spite of its Brexit position, not because of it. The confusion and rancour division won\u2019t be removed. It will be entrenched.\n\nWhile a Commons majority can only go one way, potentially giving Johnson a \u201cdecisive mandate\u201d for a hard Brexit/no deal on less than 40 per cent of the popular vote, a close result will turn on local issues as well as national and international ones.\n\nAll could hang like a Miami-Dade chad on a few dozen votes in a small clutch of marginals. The entire future \u2013 the relationship with Europe, the destiny of the NHS, everything else \u2013 might be determined by leaflets about dog-fouling fines and one-way traffic systems.\n\nThere is, as there has always been, one escape route from this monstrous maze. It isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s frankly awful. But the only logical, and much the least undemocratic, resolution to this nightmare is \u2013 or rather, thanks to Swinson, was \u2013 to ask the people a single question: have you collectively changed your mind about leaving the EU?\n\nPerhaps Jo Swinson knows something no one else does. But if she hasn\u2019t seen internal polls that convince her an election will give her what she most desires \u2013 unless bumping up her parliamentary numbers, and not avoiding Brexit, is what she really, really wants \u2013 she has loaded the revolver with five bullets.\n\nThe very best of British to her, and to us all, when the trigger is squeezed until it goes click.", "description": "Whether or not the Kremlin pleases to involve itself in determining the sovereign will of the British people, stand by for the Russian roulette general election.
