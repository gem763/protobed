The South Korean has five attacking returns in his last five games despite his side\u2019s wretched run.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi\n\nHe has had to wait his turn but Hudson-Odoi could be the next Frank\u2019s Fledglings to offer fantasy managers a cheap route to easy points.\n\nThe 18-year-old has recovered from his Achilles injury, started against Southampton last time out and scored twice for England Under-21s against Austria.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
