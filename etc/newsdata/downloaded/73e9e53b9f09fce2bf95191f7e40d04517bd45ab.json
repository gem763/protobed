It\u2019s not getting your child food or clothing. It\u2019s not even getting your child an education. It\u2019s getting your child into a college that you call \u2018exclusive.\u2019\n\n\"Are they doing this for their children or their own status?\u201d\n\nDevin Sloane, right, arrives at federal court for sentencing in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019, in Boston.

Each has gotten some amount of prison time. Sloane, founder and CEO of waterTALENT, received four months.\n\nSix more parents who've pleaded guilty are set to be sentenced by Talwani this month, beginning today with the first couple, Gregory and Marcia Abbott. The Abbotts, who reside in New York and Aspen, Colorado, paid a total of $125,000 to have their daughter's college entrance exams answers fixed to get her into Duke University, her mother's alma mater.\n\nWilliam \"Rick\" Singer leaves federal court in Boston after being charged with racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and obstruction of justice on March 12.

In holding parents accountable, Talwani has embraced the admission scam's societal significance, openly addressing the public outage that surrounds it and offering a blunt critique of the wealthy elite who used cash to cheat an admissions system some say already is stacked to their advantage.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said the case and Talwani's remarks \"reflect what people are thinking in the broader society\" \u2014 and their concerns.\n\n\"People are thinking about it,\" he said. \"It's raising lots of questions for people.\"\n\nWhen parents, such as Stephen Semprevivo, said they paid into Singer's scheme out of fear during the college admissions process, Talwani pushed back. The former Cydcor executive paid $400,000 to get his son into Georgetown University as a fake tennis recruit.\n\nMore: LA exec gets 4 months in prison for paying $400K to get son into Georgetown as a fake tennis recruit\n\nCalifornia businessman Stephen Semprevivo departs after his sentencing hearing at federal court in Boston, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019.

She singled out inner-city and rural children who lacked resources but made it to college anyway. \u201cTheir legitimacy is challenged every day that somehow they were the ones who got a break to get there.\u201d\n\nSemprevivo's attorney argued his client was a victim of Singer's manipulation, but the judge returned the discussion to the father's privilege.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t criticize you for being taken into a crime by someone with skills of masterful deception. That\u2019s how crimes happen all the time,\" Talwani said. \"I think the question that people need to ask is, what makes your children entitled to a side-door (into college)?\"\n\nThe judge sentenced Semprevivo to four months in prison.\n\nEach of the parents to go before Talwani pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in a deal with prosecutors. They admitted to taking part in one of two schemes with Singer \u2014 either paying to have someone cheat on the SAT or ACT for their children or to tag them as athletic recruits to slide them into a university. Singer called the latter scenario entry through the \"side-door.\"\n\nMarcia, left, and Gregory Abbott leave federal court, Wednesday, May 22, 2019, in Boston, where they pleaded guilty to charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal. (Photo: Michael Dwyer, AP)\n\nTalwani has given harsher sentences to parents who took part in the admissions plot, noting that it took a college seat away from a deserving student.\n\n\u201cAs I consider the culpability of those two different schemes \u2014 they\u2019re both broad, they\u2019re both illegal, they both violate the same statute \u2014 but there is something that is an order of magnitude different about buying an actual spot at a university,\" Talwani said during Semprevivo's hearing.\n\nTalwani set her tone at the Sept. 13 sentencing of actress Felicity Huffman, the first and one of the highest profile of the parents to be sentenced. Prosecutors argued colleges were victims in the scandal, but Talwani said the outrage was not about harm inflicted on colleges but about an admissions system \"already so distorted.\"\n\nHuffman told the judge her decision to pay Singer $15,000 to correct her daughter's SAT answers was rooted in concern as a mother for a child with learning disabilities.\n\nThe judge rebuked her: \"Trying to be a good mother doesn't excuse us.\"\n\nIn sentencing Huffman to 14 days in prison Talwani added, \"I don\u2019t think anyone wants to go to prison. I think without this sentence you would be looking at a future with a community around you asking how you got away with this.\"\n\nMore: NY attorney sentenced to 1 month in prison for paying $75K to have daughter's ACT answers fixed\n\nFelicity Huffman and her husband, actor William H.

Twenty-four overall defendants, including 15 parents, have pleaded guilty while the remaining, including actress Lori Loughlin, prepare for trial.\n\nIncarceration, the judge has said, is a way to deter others from committing similar crimes.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, what the government has exposed is the tip of the iceberg,\" Talwani said before sentencing New York attorney Gordon Caplan to a month in prison for paying $75,000 to have his daughter's ACT answers corrected..\n\nMore: Napa Valley vineyard owner gets five months in prison for college admissions scheme\n\nDaniel Medwed, professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University School of Law, said Talwani, with her statements, could be \u201csending a broader message to the community about privilege and how people shouldn\u2019t capitalize on their privilege in ways that are illegal and immoral.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she feels a moral obligation. Maybe she feels sort of a practical obligation as a lawyer to justify her sentences,\" he said. \"There\u2019s probably multiple motives. It\u2019s helpful to be transparent. It\u2019s helpful that all of us are getting an understanding at what\u2019s driving her sentencing.\u201d\n\nReach Joey Garrison and on Twitter @joeygarrison.\n\n.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/college-admissions-scandal-judge-takes-privilege-her-sentences/3897432002/", "description": "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani isn't just doling out prison terms in the college admissions scandal.
