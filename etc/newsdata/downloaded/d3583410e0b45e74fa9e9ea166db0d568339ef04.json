We\u2019re pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn\u2019t do his job,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTrump on the other hand was secretly putting at risk our national security by pursuing a personal political vendetta against me because I don\u2019t think he wants to run against me.\u201d\n\nBiden amplified that theme later in his speech.\n\n\u201cHe imagines that this tactic will allow him to pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to let Donald Trump choose the Democratic candidate.\u201d\n\nTrump has accused Biden of lying about his son's business dealings. The former vice president last month said he had \u201cnever spoken to my son\u201d about his work overseas, but Hunter Biden had told the New Yorker that he at one point had mentioned his Ukrainian consulting work to his father.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president tweeted a video clip of Biden making the denial before transitioning to a picture of the Bidens playing golf along with another man identified as a \u201cUkrainian gas exec.\u201d The tweet also includes a snippet of the 2005 video \u201cPhotograph\u201d by the rock group Nickelback.\n\nTo Biden, Trump\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d are a distraction.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to step back from the heated 24-hour news cycle and focus carefully on the larger story. It\u2019s not about Donald Trump\u2019s antics. It\u2019s about what has brought Donald Trump, and the nation, to this sobering moment in our history \u2014 and to the choice facing us in 2020,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\"What has brought us here is simply this: The abuse of power.\u201d\n\nBiden made clear the election and his candidacy was about one thing: defeating Trump.\n\n\u201cA lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump. I agree,\u201d Biden said. \"We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Joe Biden"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9d/4e/384413cb420e895be91e4d2ead91/191001-biden-gty-773.jpg"}
