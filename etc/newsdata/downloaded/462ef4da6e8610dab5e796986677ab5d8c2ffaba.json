Having President Donald Trump\u2019s name at the top of the ticket will ensure turnout among his supporters, yet it\u2019s also expected to bring Democrats out in huge numbers as well.\n\nWalden \u2014 a former radio station owner with a booming voice \u2014 is well respected by colleagues from both sides of the aisle, who describe him as both a savvy politician and serious legislator who likes to dig into the nitty-gritty policy details.\n\nWalden, a former chief of the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm who earned a reputation for party loyalty over his past two decades in Congress, has been quietly picking and choosing his battles with Trump this year, fueling speculation he might be eyeing the exits.\n\nThe Oregon Republican rebuked the president over the hugely controversial border wall project, backed Russia sanctions over Trump's objection, voted with Democrats to end the historic 35-day government shutdown and has been vocal about addressing climate change. But Walden also has stood by Trump throughout the Ukraine scandal and fallen in line on other key issues.\n\nWalden is the fourth House GOP committee leader to call it quits this cycle. That list includes Reps. Mike Conaway (Texas), ranking member on the Agriculture Committee; Rob Bishop (Utah), ranking member on the Natural Resources Committee; and Mac Thornberry (Texas), ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nWhile Walden could have continued as the top Republican on Energy and Commerce until the end of 2022, Conaway, Bishop and Thornberry were all facing term limits next year. Under House GOP rules, a lawmaker can only lead a committee for three terms, regardless of whether they are in the majority or minority. But House GOP leaders have been considering relaxing that policy amid growing fears it could fuel more retirements and create an institutional brain drain among Republicans.\n\nBefore wielding the Energy and Commerce gavel, Walden spent years chairing the panel\u2019s telecommunications subcommittee that oversees the Federal Communications Commission. He helped advance major legislation in that position, including a 2012 law that created the public safety communications network known as FirstNet and other measures aimed at fighting illegal robocalls, expanding broadband and freeing up airwaves to be used in 5G wireless networks.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

In 1988, he won a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives, and was then appointed to the Oregon Senate in 1995. After winning the 1998 congressional race, Walden won a seat on Energy and Commerce in 2001.\n\nWalden won reelection in his sprawling, rural district in eastern and central Oregon by 17 points in 2018. That was a comfortable margin in a bad year for the GOP, but much smaller than his previous wins. Trump carried the district by 21 points in 2016 and the GOP is likely to hang on to his seat.\n\nWalden had a successful tenure at the National Republican Congressional Committee, serving as deputy under then-Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas in the 2010 and 2012 cycles before taking the helm for the next four years.\n\nDuring the 2016 cycle, Walden notably maintained his friendship with his counterpart, Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico. Both served on the same Energy and Commerce subcommittee.\n\nJohn Hendel contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Rep.
