We increase taxes on yours. Meanwhile, I\u2019m in the middle of it all, and you know I hate the attention,\u201d Yang\u2019s Biao said. \u201cJK! I\u2019m balling out right now, cuz I\u2019m the top tariff taskmaster.\u201d\n\nWhen Che admitted he didn\u2019t expect a top Chinese official to be so candid about such a pressing issue, Biao explained it\u2019s his time to shine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having my moment. I\u2019m basically the Lizzo of China right now,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd turns out I\u2019m 100 percent that trade daddy.\u201d\n\nThe comedian and podcaster continued to serve up some much-needed laughs during the segment by breaking down the economic conflict between world superpowers in terms we can all understand.\n\n\u201cYou need us more than we need you, because we can survive without your movies starring The Rock, but good luck without iPhones,\u201d he added. \u201cHow are you gonna text us in the middle of the night like, \u2018You up? Can you investigate Joe Biden for me?\u2019 Stupid.\u201d\n\nBefore leaving the segment back in the hands of Che and Colin Jost, Yang\u2019s Biao had one last zinger for the road about how China will come out on top: \u201cWe actually built our wall. And you can see ours from space.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that an iconic \u201cSNL\u201d character was born.", "description": "Introducing \"Trade Daddy\" Chen Biao, your new favorite \"Weekend Update\" guest.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a093e2100006601aaced4.png?cache=ylyjh9atxj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
