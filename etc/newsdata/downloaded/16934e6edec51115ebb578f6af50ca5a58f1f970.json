To stamp out bad practice and hold offending companies to account.\n\nThe FCA simply does not act quickly enough to stamp out wrongdoing, says Jeff Prestridge\n\nYet all the evidence points to the fact that the Financial Conduct Authority is consistently failing in its duties \u2013 in very much the same way that its predecessor the Financial Services Authority did. It simply does not act quickly enough to stamp out wrongdoing, so by the time it intervenes, all the damage (mis-selling, for example) has already been done.\n\nIt\u2019s reactive when it should be proactive \u2013 and the fines it hands out (massive in our eyes, but not in the corporate world) do not punish despicable business practices hard enough or deter companies from misbehaving in the future.\n\nAs we report here, we have seen Prudential fined \u00a323.9million (peanuts as far as the insurer is concerned) in the past few days for strong-arming customers into unsuitable pension annuities.\n\nDreadful bullying behaviour that Pru has now thankfully brought an end to, but it goes back to before the 2008 financial crisis. Why did it take the FSA and FCA so long to act? Why indeed.\n\nSimilarly, it has demonstrated shocking levels of dilatoriness over the way insurers consistently punish loyal customers with higher premiums than those available to people coming to them for the first time. It\u2019s an issue we have written about consistently over the years.\n\nPrudential was fined \u00a323.9m (peanuts as far as the insurer is concerned) for strong-arming customers into unsuitable pension annuities\n\nFriday\u2019s report from the regulator on this consumer wrong was long on words and findings \u2013 last year, six million victims of excessive \u2018loyalty\u2019 premiums in the home and motor insurance markets \u2013 but light on decisive action. \u2018We are considering a range of industry wide measures to reform these markets so they work for consumers in the future,\u2019 it prattled on.\n\nIt is not the time for \u2018considering\u2019. It is now time for action. No insurer should be able to discriminate against loyal customers. Those that do \u2013 and have done \u2013 should be hauled over the coals, forced to compensate, and be handed fines that deter them from future malpractice.\n\nWake up FCA and bloody well do the job we pay you to do.", "description": "Little that the City regulator does fills me with confidence that it is really on top of its game - as it damned well should be.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
