They say they can\u2019t galvanize world support for their view unless they can draw a clear link back to Tehran, which has denied any role in the attacks.\n\nThe GPS systems could allow investigators to trace the drones and missiles back to their runways and launchers, which Saudi and American officials believe were in Iran. Inspectors from around the world\u2014including the U.S., France and the United Nations\u2014are scrutinizing pieces of the weapons from the attacks, which temporarily knocked out half of Saudi oil production and rattled the global economy.\n\nThe GPS examination is part of a more expansive investigation that includes efforts to trace serial numbers of the weapons used in the attacks back to their origin. The probe is going forward as Washington and Riyadh weigh a response to the attack.\n\nThe U.S. is deploying more troops and military firepower to the Middle East after the attack, which Saudi officials are privately calling their 9/11, believing Iran has crossed a red line.\n\nBut some countries, including European allies, are waiting to see more evidence before they can determine whether Iran launched the attacks, slowing down any movement toward a retaliatory response.\n\nAn attack on Saudi Aramco oil facilities has led to an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. While Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are pointing to evidence Iran was involved. Here's what we know so far.\n\nPresident Trump is hoping to use this week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly gathering in New York to build an international coalition to pressure Iran, using last weekend\u2019s strikes as fresh evidence of Tehran\u2019s belligerent actions across the region. He will be accompanied at the U.N. by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been spent the week calling U.S. allies and traveling to the Middle East to build support for a unified response to the attacks.\n\nBefore the attack, diplomats from around the world had been working to pave the way for a potential meeting between Mr. Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at this week\u2019s U.N. meeting. But the strikes upended the efforts, and both Washington and Tehran say the two leaders are unlikely to meet.\n\n\u201cNothing is ever off the table but I have no intention of meeting with Iran,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Sunday.\n\nIranian-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks. Iran has been steadfast in its denials of involvement, saying the attacks were carried out by the militants as retaliation for Saudi airstrikes that have killed civilians. The civil war in Yemen has triggered the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cThose who want to attribute the region\u2019s incidents to the Islamic Republic, it is like all their disclosed lies,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said on Sunday. \u201cIf you are honest and really seek security for the region, they should not send this many weapons, planes, bombs and dangerous arms.\u201d\n\nThe attacks temporarily knocked out half of Saudi oil production.

The drones and cruise missiles appear to be of Iranian origin, they said. U.S. officials said there was suspicious movement at an Iranian base in southwestern Iran shortly before the attacks. And Houthi forces have never used the kinds of drones deployed in the attack, Saudi officials have said.\n\nSaudi and American officials recognize that they may need to find a \u201csmoking gun\u201d before wary allies will accept their conclusions that Iran staged the attack.\n\nThat is why investigators are focused on the GPS systems recovered from the attack sites. The systems should include information that would allow weapons inspectors to trace the missiles and drone routes back to their origin. The weapons specialists are trying to find out how much data they can recover. Once they finish the investigation, which could take weeks, Saudi and American officials hope to make a public case.\n\nAramco officials say they are working 24/7 to repair their damaged oil facilities.

The movement is divided between those who see their ties to Tehran as an asset, and those who see it as a liability. The two factions have spent months jockeying for control. And the U.S., U.N. and Saudi Arabia have all tried to boost those looking to distance the Houthi movement from Iran.\n\n\u2014Summer Said in Dubai\n\nand Aresu Eqbali in Tehran\n\ncontributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com", "description": "Weapons experts are inspecting GPS systems recovered from the Sept. 14 missile and drone strike on Saudi Arabian oil facilities for evidence that could reveal their origin and flight path, according to people familiar with the investigation.", "authors": ["Dion Nissenbaum", "Dion.Nissenbaum Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109652/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
