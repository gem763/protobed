But the 15-yard penalty still got enforced for what officials said was abusive language.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s uncharacteristic of not his emotion, but how he conducts himself, the consequences,\u201d said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who was then informed on what led to the penalty. \u201cOh, I hope the little darlin\u2019 didn\u2019t hear something he hadn\u2019t heard before.\u201d\n\nThat came only a couple of series after Garrett had unsuccessfully challenged a 39-yard pass interference call against cornerback Anthony Brown, right before Aaron Jones\u2019 fourth rushing touchdown put the Packers (4-1) ahead 31-3.\n\nAfter his first challenge didn\u2019t get overturned, Garrett had one left - and had to use it for Cooper\u2019s catch that side judge Scott Edwards had ruled incomplete. The red flag got thrown near the feet of Edwards, who pulled out the yellow flag after hearing from the coach.\n\n\u201cI knew that was the situation. We had to use it in that particular situation to correct the mistake that they made. Didn\u2019t handle it well,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cOur team handled it really well, though. \u2026 Our team did a really good job handling that adversity.\u201d\n\nOn first-and-25 after the penalty was enforced, Ezekiel Elliott caught a 26-yard pass, and a few plays later had a 2-yard touchdown run that cut the deficit to 31-17.\n\nReferee Ron Torbert told a pool reporter after the game that Garrett used abusive language to an official, and that there was no consideration of wiping out the penalty even when Edwards\u2019 call was overturned.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to pick up that flag. It was abusive language toward an official. It was unsportsmanlike conduct toward an official,\u201d said Torbert, refusing to reveal if there was any profanity. \u201cSo that was going to be enforced regardless of the outcome of the review.\u201d\n\nPrescott finished with a career-high 463 yards passing with two touchdowns, but also matched a career high with three interceptions - and his total for the first four games this season. He was also sacked three times, doubling his season total.\n\nThe Cowboys finished with 563 total yards, their most ever in a loss.\n\nDallas was still down 14 after forcing a Packers punt with 10:29 left when Prescott\u2019s short pass toward Michael Gallup was picked off, setting up a field goal for Green Bay. Prescott thought there would be a pass interference call on that play.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how many yards I had or anything else like that. Three interceptions and a loss \u2026 none of that matters,\u201d Prescott said.\n\nCooper had a 53-yard touchdown catch midway through the fourth quarter, and finished with 11 catches for a career-high 226 yards. But his feelings were similar to Prescott, more focused on the Cowboys\u2018 first drive, when the ball went off his hands and was picked off to set up the first touchdown by Green Bay.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really on my mind is the dropped ball and the turnover it created. I feel like it gave them a lot of momentum in the game,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI got it, that\u2019s what I was thinking. Those are the worst three words in football. \u2026 It was an easy catch, took my eyes off it because I was focused on the touchdown, and I dropped it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jason Garrett slammed the red challenge flag to the ground in front of an official, and emphasized his displeasure by adding a few choice words that drew a yellow flag for unsportsmanlike conduct.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/packers_cowboys_football_39723_c0-245-3625-2358_s1770x1032.jpg?afe4e430da0cdc6e275adc5647da4059ba3991ac", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
