We celebrate this year 40 years of welcoming students from Chinese mainland, and the first student from China to arrive at UNSW was in 1952, so we have been receiving students from China since we were a baby \u2014 three years young.\"\n\nThe disciplines that Chinese students choose to study at UNSW include engineering, business, and computer science, and the interest of Chinese students in other disciplines has grown greatly recently, he said.\n\nUNSW is also proud of its Confucius Institute, which was established 10 years ago in partnership with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, he said.\n\nThe Confucius Institute was an important development in the university's broad partnership with China. It enabled the university to grow its relationship with SJTU and made important contributions to build Chinese literacy, he added.\n\nIan Jacobs, president and vice-chancellor of UNSW Sydney, said: \"We see language education provided by the Confucius Institute and understanding of culture between China and Australia as of critical importance for the future of both countries.\"\n\nFiona Docherty, vice-president of external relations, said there has been a huge increase in interest from young Australians wishing to spend time in China and understand the amazing country in its cultural, economic and social aspects.\n\nThe Confucius Institute has been able to support its language training, and offer students the opportunity to spend time in China while working on their degrees, she said.\n\nChina overtook the United States two years ago as the top destination for students in UNSW to go overseas and the Confucius Institute, through study tours and language training, has been instrumental in ensuring China is a popular choice for UNSW students, Pearcey added.", "description": "The University of New South Wales Sydney continues to see continuing and growing demand from Chinese students in the future as a reflection of China's interest in high-quality education, said Laurie Pearcey, pro vice-chancellor (international), UNSW Sydney.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9ec4d9a310cf3e97a078ba.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
