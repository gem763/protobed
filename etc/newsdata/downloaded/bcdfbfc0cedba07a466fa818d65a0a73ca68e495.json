But 50 years after the release of the last album they\u2019d record as a group, it\u2019s still staggering how much ground they covered in under a decade. It\u2019s also impressive that their final run together works so perfectly as the culmination of their greatness\u2014a perfect benediction for what must\u2019ve been one wild, unexpected, and creative ride. Abbey Road remains a masterpiece.\n\nThe Beatles\u2019 final album is their strongest and the best summation of the foursome\u2019s best qualities. Revolver may be their most unequivocally groundbreaking, but rock music had continuously pushed forward so consistently in the years since that it sounded like old hat by 1969. Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band may be their most historically important, but its mythological reputation belies a collection of songs that can often feel middling and indulgent compared to their other work. And The Beatles (aka \u201cThe White Album\u201d) is such a behemoth that it can\u2019t help but contain many of their most scattershot moments as a collective. But Abbey Road has the inspired creativity of Revolver, the faux-conceptualism of Sgt. Pepper\u2019s, and the individual brilliance of \u201cThe White Album\u201d\u2014all delivered with a production flair and instrumental gloss that suggests the band knew this was their last chance to be their best selves.\n\nAs with virtually every Beatles\u2019 album after 1966, Abbey Road feels like a McCartney-driven affair. The famous song suite that dominates its second half has the hallmarks of his forthcoming Wings-era: sonic pomp undercutting lyrical inanity; a breadth of disparate ideas melded into one thrilling musical statement. But John Lennon\u2019s presence on the album is formidable. It goes under-discussed just how much Lennon\u2019s heroin addiction affected his waning months within the Beatles, and his somewhat diminished presence across both the Let It Be and Abbey Road projects belies a man who had one foot out the door. Lennon\u2019s attention was being pulled by heroin, his irritation with battling McCartney over business, and his intense affair-turned-marriage to Yoko Ono. His songwriting was the lifeblood of the Beatles circa 1964-1966, and his bold creativity informed their 1966 transformation from pop idols to studio innovators. By 1969, distracted as he was, Lennon was still an essential part of this band. His standouts\u2014the sludgy hard-rocking classic \u201cI Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u201d and elaborately harmony-driven \u201cBecause\u201d\u2014are two of the best moments on Abbey Road, and his contributions to the album\u2019s second half are indispensable. New light has been shed that reveals that Lennon was more into the quasi-operetta half of the album than fans have thought over the years, but in the immediate aftermath of the album\u2019s success, he was dismissive.\n\n\u201cI liked the A side,\u201d John Lennon would tell Rolling Stone in 1970. \u201cI never liked that sort of pop opera on the other side. I think it\u2019s junk. It was just bits of song thrown together. And I can\u2019t remember what some of it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two of them were on heroin,\u201d said McCartney years later of John and Yoko during the sessions, \u201cAnd this was a fairly big shocker for us because we all thought we were far-out boys, but we kind of understood that we\u2019d never get quite that far out.\u201d\n\n\u201c The two of them were on heroin. And this was a fairly big shocker for us because we all thought we were far-out boys, but we kind of understood that we\u2019d never get quite that far out. \u201d\n\nMcCartney\u2019s reputation for meticulousness and craft is well-earned on Abbey Road. Of all the principals involved, it sounds most like Paul. His workhorse nature would sometimes cause rifts within the band (Harrison and Ringo Starr reportedly hated working endless hours on the daft \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer,\u201d while Lennon didn\u2019t play on the track at all) but when it worked, his vision could push the band to its highest heights\u2014as on the stellar one-two punch of \u201cPolythene Pam\u201d and \u201cShe Came In Through the Bathroom Window.\u201d And his creative bass playing is one of the album\u2019s delights; it\u2019s Paul\u2019s bass that truly elevates Lennon\u2019s Chuck Berry-nicking hit \u201cCome Together,\u201d and it\u2019s the secret pulse of Harrison\u2019s \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201d\n\nRingo Starr\u2019s only written contribution to the album was technically a co-write with George, but \u201cOctopus\u2019 Garden\u201d is the kind of winning kiddie singalong that\u2019s endearing, as opposed to irritating a la \u201cYellow Submarine,\u201d and Starr\u2019s unique drumming is another one of the album\u2019s strengths. It\u2019s Ringo\u2019s different strokes that color and re-color \u201c\u2026She\u2019s So Heavy,\u201d and that propels the band through the musical shifts of the album\u2019s second half.\n\nIt\u2019s Harrison\u2019s guitar that serves as a binding element throughout the album. His playing is the most fluid and assured it would ever sound on a Beatles\u2019 record; from the soaringly melodic solo on \u201cSomething\u201d to the arpeggiated leads on \u201cSun King,\u201d Harrison\u2019s confidence is as evident as Lennon\u2019s apathy. Much is made of George\u2019s \u201cemergence\u201d on Abbey Road, although his talents had become more and more evident within the Beatles (and via his production work outside the group for acts like Billy Preston and Jackie Lomax) for years. But he\u2019d gotten sour on the Fab experience far earlier than his bandmates, and sometimes his indifference showed in how little he participated in certain albums\u2014like Sgt. Pepper\u2019s. But since he\u2019d gotten over his mid-\u201860s sitar fixation and renewed his focus on guitar playing in 1968, Harrison had grown by leaps and bounds. And as a songwriter, the twin standouts of \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d and \u201cSomething\u201d put him squarely in league with his more celebrated bandmates.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t Lennon or I wasn\u2019t McCartney. I was me,\u201d Harrison told the BBC a few days after the album\u2019s release. \u201cAnd the only reason I started to write songs was because I thought, well if they can write them, I can write them. You know, \u2018cause really, everybody can write songs if they want to. If they have a desire to and if they have sort of some musical knowledge and background. And then it\u2019s by writing them the same as writing books or writing articles or painting\u2014the more you do it, the better or the more you can understand how to do it. And I used to just write songs. I still do. I just write a song and it just comes out however it wants to. And some of them are catchy songs like \u2018Here Comes The Sun\u2019 and some of them aren\u2019t, you know. But to me there\u2019s just songs and I just write them and some will be considered as good by maybe the masses and some won\u2019t. But to me they\u2019re just songs, things that are there that have to be got out.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he considered himself a late-bloomer, Harrison\u2019s response was typical George: \u201cWhat\u2019s late and what\u2019s early?\u201d\n\nAbbey Road\u2019s sonic texture falls just shy of gloss\u2014the kind of overdubbed and streamlined sound that would come to define classic rock albums of the 1970s. Criticized by some reviewers at the time for its emphasis on \u201celectronics,\u201d it\u2019s the Beatles at their most polished and their most contemporary. And their most final.\n\nA month after the album\u2019s release and while it was still at No. 1, McCartney would somewhat nonchalantly announce the end of the band in an interview with Life.\n\n\u201cI would rather do what I began by doing, which is making music. We make good music and we want to go on making good music. But the Beatle thing is over. It has been exploded, partly by what we have done, and partly by other people. We are individuals\u2014all different. John married Yoko, I married Linda. We didn\u2019t marry the same girl.\u201d\n\nBut The Beatles\u2019 breakup wouldn\u2019t become public knowledge for almost another six months, though they would never enter the studio again as a group after fall 1969. Some overdubbing for the Get Back project (released somewhat posthumously in 1970 as the band\u2019s final album, Let It Be) would be the last time they worked on anything Beatles-related until Harrison, McCartney and Starr partnered up for 1995\u2019s Anthology. For all intents and purposes, Abbey Road was the end. And given what they were able to accomplish on this record, they couldn\u2019t have given the world a better farewell.", "description": "Stereo Williams on the 50th anniversary of \u201cAbbey Road,\u201d the Beatles\u2019 \u201clast chance to be their best selves.\u201d", "authors": ["Stereo Williams"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569466843/190925-stereo-abbey-road-tease_vyrcm3", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
