Samuel Umtiti has recovered from a foot injury and goes straight into the starting line-up for Barcelona as Gerard Pique misses out through suspension. Umtiti partners Clement Lenglet at centre back for Barca. The last, and only, time those two started together was in the Catalans' 4-4 draw away to Villarreal last season. A victory for Barcelona today will see them move up to the top of La Liga, at least until the rest of the league plays later today. If Eibar pull off a surprise win they'll move into the top ten. A few highlights here from the genius that in Lionel Messi in his previous matches against Eibar: Eibar have won their last two home games. The last time they won three or more home games in a row was in December 2017 when they won four. Will they break that duck today or will Barcelona too strong to overcome.

It came in September 2017 where Barca won 6-1 at Camp Nou. Leo Messi has 15 goals in 9 games against Eibar and Luis Suarez has netted in each of his last six games against them. Before that though, Barcelona have to face a determined Eibar side at Ipurua later today. No side has won more La Liga games against Eibar than Barcelona. They are level on 9 wins with Atletico Madrid. Of the ten games between the two sides in La Liga, Barcelona have scored in every one averaging 3.3 goals per game. The Blaugrana side have conceded the most goals in the top flight against Barcelona with 33.

Today, Barcelona and Real Madrid agreed to a new date: 18th December. Barcelona and Real Madrid agree to December Clasico due to protests For those of you interested in superstition, in their last 8 away games in La Liga Barcelona have alternated between scoring two goals and failing to score. In their last away game, against Getafe, they scored two goals. Does that give Eibar the advantage today? The last time the two sides met in La Liga was at the end of last season when Barcelona had already sealed the title. Barca travelled to Ipurua and came away with a 2-2 draw. Marc Cucurella opened the scoring for Eibar before a brace from Leo Messi put Barca in front. Pablo de Blasis equalised on the stroke of half-time for the home side and no goals in the second half saw the game end in a draw. As Barcelona aim to go top of La Liga today they'll have to go one better at Ipurua and secure a win.
