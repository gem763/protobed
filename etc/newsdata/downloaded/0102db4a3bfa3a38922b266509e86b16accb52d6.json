The killing happened in 2001 but Ward was not arrested and charged until 2004.\n\nA judge heard that Mr Wood, aged 31 years, was found beaten and stabbed in his bloodstained flat in Gairn Close, Tilehurst, Reading with a butter knife sticking out of his chest.\n\nDetectives spent three-and-a-half years hunting the killer but only made former heroin addict Ward their prime suspect in 2003.\n\nThe court heard that Ward already had 41 previous crimes on his record. He was ordered to serve at least 14 years in jail.\n\nMr Wood was stabbed several times in the chest, back and head, with the tip of one knife broken off in his forehead. It was believed he had also been tortured before he died.\n\nThe court heard that Ward attacked Mr Wood on March 27, 2001, because the victim sold one of the defendant's videos for 50p to buy a bottle of cider.", "description": "Nicholas Ward didn't return to Spring Hill open prison in Buckinghamshire after a home visit yesterday - members of the public have been told not to approach him", "authors": ["Neil Hyde", "Image", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20579496.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195918847.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
