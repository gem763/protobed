The remaining opposition lawmakers stayed away in protest, according to Associated Press reports.\n\nThe change won't be official until the Greek parliament approves it.\n\nOpponents of the deal protested outside the Macedonian parliament on Friday, responding to the vote with calls of \"traitors,\" AP reports. Conservative opposition leader Hristijan Mickoski told reporters that the vote was \"an act of treason.\"\n\nMacedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev agreed to rename the country in a compromise with his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras last June. The proposed name change weathered protests from nationalists in both countries \u2014 and a referendum in Macedonia that failed to meet the turnout requirement.\n\nGreece and Macedonia have been locked into a dispute over the name that dates back to 1991 during the disintegration of Yugoslavia, when the Republic of Macedonia broke away.\n\nGreece already contained a region called Macedonia, which incorporates most of the territories of the eponymous ancient kingdom that was led centuries ago by Alexander the Great. Both Greece and its northern neighbor consider Alexander, and the name, integral parts of their identity, Kakissis reports.\n\nPrevious Greek governments have also claimed the tiny Republic of Macedonia might use the name to make territorial claims on its province.\n\nThe disagreement has sparked protests on both sides of the territorial boundary and produced real consequences: Greece has blocked Macedonia's entry into both NATO and the European Union. Greece had previously referred to Macedonia as Skopje, after its capital, or Fyrom, an acronym for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted support of the agreement on Friday, calling it \"an important contribution to a stable and prosperous region.\"\n\nA public referendum in Macedonia to change the name last September won overwhelming support but fell short of the 50 percent turnout required to validate the change, after protesters pushed for a boycott.\n\n\"It is humiliating that I must not call myself a Macedonian, the only name I have for myself and for my ancestors and for my children only because of a political deal and diplomatic deal,\" one protester told NPR at the time.", "description": "Greece has blocked its northern neighbor from entering into NATO for 27 years because of an argument over which country has a right to the name \"Macedonia.\"", "authors": ["Francesca Paris"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/11/ap_19011678027833_wide-4b13bb91b5b150afa8028c3b562ad9245ed32bc8.jpg?s=1400"}
