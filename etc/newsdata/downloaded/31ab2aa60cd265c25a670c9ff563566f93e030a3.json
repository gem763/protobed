She came over, she played me the video. I'm so proud of her. She's been through so much. I've watched so much happen in her life and had a front row seat to so much, and I'm so proud of her. She is such a revelation because now she's making her best stuff. I am 100 percent convinced this is the best thing she's done so far.\"\n\nLowe asked Swift what the difference is between Gomez before and now. Swift demurred there, but she had glowing things to say about how much pride she had to see Gomez throughout her journey. \"You know, I think no one can say that better than she can, but just from my perspective as her friend, I've just never been more proud,\" she started. \"The things that she\u2019s overcome, the situations she\u2019s risen above, it\u2019s been a long time since we were friends and she\u2019s the best. She\u2019s just the best. I\u2019m really excited because when somebody has had great life experience, has had really tough things they\u2019ve had to go through and they can process that and make art that\u2019s going to help other people, that\u2019s what kind of song this is. I\u2019m stoked.\"\n\nView photos Photo credit: Kevin Mazur - Getty Images More\n\nLowe later played Swift's responses to Gomez during her interview. Gomez got emotional hearing what Swift said. \"Aw, that was very sweet,\" Gomez started.\n\nLowe asked, \"Without friends, where do you go?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t,\" Gomez responded truthfully. \"[Taylor has been an] amazing [friend]. For sure. She was frustrated when I was frustrated; she was sad when I was sad. But more than anything, my friends stood by my side. I think they visibly saw me in so much pain. And they didn\u2019t want it for me but they\u2014sorry\u2014\" Gomez paused, nearly choking up. \"They never stopped loving me. And I played her the song, and I played it with her mom and dad, and I showed her the video and her mom and Taylor started crying. And it wasn\u2019t because the song was emotional. It was just because the first thing they said to me was, \u2018We\u2019re so happy that you\u2019re here. After seeing all of that, this is such a cool moment.\u2019 And that\u2019s a huge thing for me.\"\n\nIn the worst of her heartbreak, Gomez admitted, \"It was awful. Yeah, it was pretty terrible. And that\u2019s okay. I think I had experienced years of it already so I wasn\u2019t really thrown off, but I was just exhausted.\" (Bieber and Gomez were on-off for nearly 10 years.)\n\n\"My heart was just so tired,\" Gomez continued. \"And I think that allowing myself to just say that was important for me.\"\n\nIt was that reason Gomez took a break to allow herself to process things on her own and heal. \"I started noticing that my life just became a story, and it was entertainment, and I was just not okay with that because it was real and it was very real to me,\" she said. \"And I think that\u2019s the time I needed to just say I\u2019m not going to be a part of this anymore.\" Gomez is in a different, \"happy\" space now, a year after that initial pain.\n\nFor more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter.\n\nsubscribe here\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"She was frustrated when I was frustrated; she was sad when I was sad.\"", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N1e_rcmURhJRQp6B7bEBCA--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/0b12f4988fd093cd151af3bed70af39c", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
