They get it.\"\n\nCaptured wild horses are kept in holding pens and put up for adoption. Some want the animals to be sold for slaughter.

It's not clear when the full Senate will consider the measure.\n\nPendley said the agency is spending $50m a year to house 50,000 captured horses in government corrals and a further $30m in associated costs.\n\nAlan Shepherd, the head of the bureau's wild horse and burro programme in Nevada, planned to join members of the new coalition at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno on Wednesday night for the screening of a documentary that blames horses for the severe degradation of federal rangeland.\n\nDoug Busselman, executive director of the Nevada Farm Bureau, said his group still wants Congress to allow the government to sell excess horses without the current ban on their resale for slaughter.\n\n\"As long as the numbers are so far above appropriate management levels, the tools of fertility control and adoption don't accomplish the needs for having wild horse and burro populations match the carrying capacity of the herd-management levels and the destruction of the habitat will continue,\" he said in a statement.\n\nConservationists say more damage is caused by the cattle and sheep that graze on public lands at a ratio of 15-to-1 mustangs.\n\n\"This film is a propaganda piece ... that scapegoats relatively rare wild horses for problems that in truth are caused by the domestic cattle that are widespread environmental problems across the West,\" said Erik Molvar, a wildlife biologist for the Western Watersheds Project.", "description": "Wild horses are blamed for damage to federal lands in west, but conservationists say cattle and sheep are the culprits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/f89000d90de7458ab9c8a3fdc904d262_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
