While surely a disruption to recovery efforts in the northwestern Bahamas, its bouts of wind and rain are not nearly as fierce as the onslaught inflicted by Dorian. Rainfall totals are forecast to reach 2 to 4 inches from the intermittent storms sweeping across the islands.\n\nSqually weather is likely to continue over the northwest Bahamas, still under a tropical storm warning, for another day as Humberto gradually lifts to their north and then east.\n\nAside from generating rough surf and rip currents along the Florida and Southeast coast, Humberto is not anticipated to produce significant storm impacts in the United States. Florida on Friday had been under a tropical storm watch, which has since been discontinued.\n\nThe Hurricane Center forecasts Humberto to steadily intensify and become a hurricane by Monday. By the middle to latter portion of next week, the storm may come close to Bermuda, which will need to monitor its progress.\n\nAdditional disturbances under investigation\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is tracking three other areas of disturbed weather in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico \u2014 although none have high chances to develop into storms immediately.\n\nGulf of Mexico disturbance\n\nClosest to the United States, showers and thunderstorms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico could become better organized as they drift toward the western Gulf in a few days. The Hurricane Center gives this disturbance a 30 percent chance of becoming a tropical depression or storm over the next five days.\n\n\u201cWe are watching for the potential for heavy rain during the Monday through Wednesday period next week,\u201d tweeted Eric Berger, a meteorologist for the Houston weather blog SpaceCityWeather.com.\n\nEastern Atlantic disturbances\n\nBetween the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles, two disturbances bear watching.\n\nThe disturbance labeled \u201c1\u2033 in the map above, 950 miles east of the Lesser Antilles, has little chance to develop immediately (0 percent according to the Hurricane Center) and just a 10 percent chance of developing over the next five days.\n\nThe disturbances labeled \u201c2\u2033 and \u201c3\u2033 have merged into one disturbance and have a 20 percent chance to develop into a depression or storm in the next 48 hours but a 60 percent chance over the next five days. This disturbance, about 650 miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, is forecast to track westward, but its long-term track and whether it will affect land areas is uncertain.", "description": "Humberto is no longer a threat to Florida or the Southeast coast.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "September At Am", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
