It was the astronauts who started taking Hasselblad cameras with them to see what they would get.\n\n\"NASA hadn't really planned for this, but they realized that pictures were a very important part of the message,\" he added, \"and that people back on Earth wanted to see what was going on up there.\"\n\nJupiter's moon Io as seen by the Cassini spacecraft, launched in 1997.

Peculiarly, most of the photographs from that mission -- including the most iconic one -- didn't feature the first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, but the second, Buzz Aldrin.\n\n\"It just happened to be Armstrong holding the camera most of the time,\" said Bizony. \"So although Buzz Aldrin didn't have the satisfaction of being the first man on the moon, it's his image that represents that great achievement.\"\n\nBuzz Aldrin's foot on the moon.

Over time, the imaging technology used on NASA probes and telescopes has improved vastly, although the nature of space exploration means the agency often relies on outdated equipment.\n\n\"Even the most high-tech NASA space probe is using technology from 10 years ago, because it takes 10 years to develop and build a complex space program,\" said Bizony.\n\nAstronaut Ed White, photographed by commander Jim McDivitt, in June 1965 aboard Gemini 4, NASA's first spacewalk mission.

It's almost as though Mars is just around the corner.\"\n\nNASA hasn't launched a program capable of manned spaceflight since the retirement of its Space Shuttle fleet in 2011. Trips to and from the International Space Station have been operated by Russia using the country's Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nThe rover Curiosity in a self-portrait taken on Aug. 5, 2015 on Mars.

But the truth is: That's just not possible in the current generation, because we don't really know how to solve a lot of the problems that come with that.\n\n\"Going back to the moon would be much more realistic, but whether or not there's the money to put humans back on the moon -- I'm not sure.\"\n\nApollo 11 Command Module Pilot Michael Collins inspects NASA's Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.
