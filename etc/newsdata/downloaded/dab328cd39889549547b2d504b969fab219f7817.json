In late August, the Delray Beach, Florida, native took down both Anastasia Potapova and Timea Babos at the US Open before reaching the third round and falling to world No. 1 Naomi Osaka in straight sets. She then ran the table at Upper Austria Ladies Linz in October, defeating four top-100 players \u2014 including then-world No.8 Kiki Bertens \u2014 en route to her first World Tennis Association (WTA) title.\n\nAt her age, neither Venus nor Serena Williams had achieved the same feat.\n\nGauff's rapid success has put the world of tennis on notice, and her rankings have reflected that ascent. After starting the year at No. 685 in the WTA rankings, the teen has climbed into the top-100 at No. 71.\n\nGauff herself may have put it best to reporters after her victory in Linz: \"This was definitely not on the calendar at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nIt hasn't been all smooth sailing for Gauff, who lost in straight sets in the first round of the Citi Open back in late July. She also dropped her opening match at the BGL BNP Paribas Luxembourg Open to world No. 66 Anna Blinkova.\n\nRead more: Simone Biles is the most dominant athlete on the planet, and now she's primed to become the most accomplished Olympian of all time\n\nYou could chalk Gauff's early exits up to growing pains, but famed tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou \u2014 who has taken on Gauff as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 but is best known for coaching Serena Williams \u2014 is directing blame elsewhere.\n\nCoco Gauff at the 2019 US Open.

Mouratoglou believes that abiding by these regulations has stymied Gauff's growth as a player and that she could more quickly overcome her early-career jitters with more exposure on the court.\n\n\"You have to consider that when it's the right momentum, it's the right momentum,\" Mouratoglou told The Daily Mail.\n\nGauff turns 16 in March of 2020, and since she's already competed in 12 tournaments this year, she won't have much flexibility in the way of elite competition for the next few months.\n\n\"This is going to slow her down for sure,\" Mouratoglou said. \"You are basically preventing young players from doing their job.\"\n\nCoco Gauff competes at Wimbledon in 2019.

Mouratoglou described her as \"impressive in all aspects,\" while Serena Williams told Tennis.com that \"soon she'll be on other girls' walls.\"\n\nOn the men's side of the net, Roger Federer said Gauff \"wanted to be on the big court... Good players, that's where they shine, I'd say.\"\n\nNick Kyrgios, meanwhile, described the budding star as \"the real deal\" and said, \"she's going to have the potential to do some amazing things in this sport.\"\n\nHaving already faced some of the sport's top contenders and with so many big names showing confidence in her abilities, it's just a matter of time before Gauff blossoms into the heir apparent to Serena Williams' throne that she is oft thought to be.", "description": "After winning her first WTA title this week, Coco Gauff launched into the top 100 of the WTA rankings for the first time in her young career.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da759504af909715a5b2d3b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
