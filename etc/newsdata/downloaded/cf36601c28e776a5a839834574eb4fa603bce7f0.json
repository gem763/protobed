No one minds calling these clean-skinned, shiny-eyed girls \u2018totty,\u2019 even to their clean-skinned, shiny-eyed faces. They are not Bambis in the forest exactly. They are smoking, drinking, knowing. They witness the back-room mischief of the political classes. Which is fun.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe set the mood for the luncheon as \u201clouche, loud, risque.\u201d\n\nEdwardes reported, \u201cWine is poured; wine is drunk.\u201d\n\nAnd then: \u201cI\u2019m seated on Johnson\u2019s right; on his left is a young woman I know. I can\u2019t remember any Bambis that day. Maybe we were the Bambis. More wine is poured; more wine is drunk. Under the table, I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s flak-catchers denied the allegations, Edwardes replied on Twitter, \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d\n\nWho is Boris Johnson? His life in photos.\n\nThe allegations about Johnson\u2019s relationship with Arcuri, the U.S. businesswoman, relate to a different period of his life.\n\nArcuri moved to London in 2011 for a one-year MBA degree. Shortly after, she met Johnson \u2014 she was 27; he was 47 and mayor of London.\n\nAD\n\nArcuri set up a company called Innotech, which held discussions or \u201csummits\u201d with tech entrepreneurs, politicians and policymakers. The group\u2019s first keynote speaker was Johnson, according to British news reports.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, Arcuri\u2019s technology company received thousands of pounds of public money from the mayor\u2019s promotional agency.\n\nArcuri was also invited to join Johnson on three foreign trade missions, to Singapore and Malaysia, New York, and Tel Aviv, despite not being eligible to take part in them, the paper said. On two of the trips, the mayor\u2019s office intervened to ensure she could come, the paper said.\n\nThe paper said she told friends she was having a sexual affair with Johnson, raising questions about a conflict of interest.\n\nOn Friday, the issue was referred to a police watchdog, which is considering whether the prime minister should be investigated for misconduct in public office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking on \u201cThe Andrew Marr Show\u201d on Sunday, Johnson insisted that \u201ceverything was done with full propriety.\u201d\n\nSenior ministers in Johnson\u2019s newly assembled cabinet have been called upon to defend the prime minister.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid endorsed Johnson\u2019s denials about the Spectator lunch.\n\n\u201cI talked to the prime minister about that, and, first of all, he couldn\u2019t be clearer, absolutely clear, that they are completely untrue, and I totally trust him on that,\u201d Javid told the BBC.\n\nConservative lawmaker Rachel Maclean defended Johnson\u2019s feminist credentials.\n\n\u201cI am a feminist,\u201d she said. \u201cI am proud to say that and I\u2019m proud to be part of a government that is led by a feminist.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnother member of Johnson\u2019s cabinet, Matt Hancock, said that he knew the accusing journalist well and described her as \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSince taking office in July, Johnson has been widely criticized for his use of language in relation to women.\n\nMany thought he crossed a line when he seemed to call Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d during his first prime minister\u2019s questions. He also called former prime minister David Cameron a \u201cgirly swot\u201d \u2014 a schoolboy taunt for overly diligent students \u2014 in a leaked cabinet paper.\n\nHis casual dismissal of female lawmakers\u2019 concerns over threats of violence last week also drew widespread criticism.\n\nAD\n\nIn the latest YouGov poll, there was a notable gender gap in terms of Johnson\u2019s likability, with 44 percent of men and 34 percent of women saying they find Johnson \u201clikable.\u201d\n\nMandu Reid, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, said, \u201cFollowing the example of men like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump, Johnson uses a calculated blend of racism, sexism and buffoonery to appeal to his base and present himself as a populist \u2018man of the people.\u2019 This is not only gross, it is also dangerous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s professional and private relationships have made headlines before.\n\nIn 2004, he was fired from a Conservative Party leadership post after lying about an affair with a Spectator staffer. Johnson, who was married at the time, had originally told reporters the claim was an \u201cinverted pyramid of piffle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMore recently, police were called to his home in the summer following a noisy spat he had with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds.\n\nU.K. Supreme Court rules Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally\n\nThe \u2018rebel alliance\u2019 teamed up to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s plans. Can it stay united to steer Brexit?\n\nBoris Johnson has four options to escape his Brexit mess. One of them is to go to jail.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Downing Street denies the allegation that he grabbed Charlotte Edwardes\u2019s thigh at a 1999 lunch.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KgaMZ6P2Yqfzy3YsibocXvuBdas=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HHLWT4HDSMI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
