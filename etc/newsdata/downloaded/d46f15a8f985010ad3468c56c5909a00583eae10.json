We\u2019ve witnessed the rise of \u2018mommy\u2019s wine time\u2019 and have normalised a drinking culture that rewards mothers with alcohol for a job well done. Champagne and mimosas \u201cfor the mommies\u201d have become commonplace at playdates and kiddies\u2019 birthday parties, and no-one bats an eye anymore when a mother pours herself a glass of wine after witching hour.\n\nIn many ways, the normalisation of the \u2018wine mom culture\u2019 has offered mothers some respite, freeing them from the unrealistic expectation that they need to be on their best behaviour all of the time. Making it okay for moms to drink has given them permission to let their hair down once in a while and have some carefree fun.\n\nBut there\u2019s a new trend on the rise and it involves shelving your chardonnay and ditching the daiquiris for healthier, alcohol-free alternatives. It could simply be a hard come-down from decades of casual drinking, but there\u2019s a growing shift among mothers globally, with many trying sobriety on for size.\n\nThe Sober Curious Movement\n\nThis societal shift seems to have originated from certain moms going public about their dangerous dependence on alcohol, while others simply prefer to opt out of Happy Hour and are sick of feeling judged for not joining in the festivities.\n\nIn 2017, former UK advertising executive turned stay-at-home mom Clare Pooley penned The Sober Diaries, a brave account of how she beat cancer, depression and her dependence on booze. The mom of three is now an advocate for sober moms everywhere, even offering inspiration, resources and support through her blog and Facebook group, Sober Mummy.\n\nOne year later, British author Ruby Warrington published Sober Curious, a research-dense piece of writing that draws on expert interviews and personal narrative to explore the many benefits of a life without alcohol. Besides zero hangovers, some of these benefits include reduced inflammation, better skin and better sleep. Taking these into account, it\u2019s easy to see why more moms are opting for a sober lifestyle.\n\nSober celebs setting the trend\n\nSome celebrity moms who prefer not to binge include Jennifer Lopez, Kim Kardashian-West and Blake Lively. Others, like Jada Pinkett-Smith, Eva Mendez, Drew Barrymore and Nicole Ritchie, have admitted to struggling with alcohol addiction and now abstain from drinking altogether.\n\nIn 2017, celeb mom-of-two Chrissy Teigen admitted to Cosmopolitan that she was \u201cpoint blank, drinking too much\u201d and said that, if it continued to become a problem, she would go completely dry. \u201cI used to think it was kind of nutty to have to go totally sober, but now I get it,\u201d she told the mag\n\nLate night talk show host Busy Philipps, of Dawson\u2019s Creek fame, also shared with Parent mag in 2018 that she refrains from drinking when she\u2019s with her two girls, Birdie (11) and Cricket (6). The famous mom admitted to loving \u201ca good margarita\u201d but said she doesn\u2019t believe that parenting and alcohol need to be tied together. \u201cI\u2019m the best mom when I\u2019m sober,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, Oscar winner Anne Hathaway, who is currently pregnant with baby number 2, famously pledged to stop drinking until her kids were out of the house. She noted that alcohol made her less available to her son, recognising that, while drinking can be \u201cfun and awesome\u201d it didn\u2019t feel all that fun and awesome the next day while doing school drop off.\n\nKnow your limit\n\nMost supporters of the sober curious movement, and even those who are more sober serious (as a result of alcohol abuse and addiction), are adamant that, while drinking might not be for them, they\u2019re not judgmental of people who do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that everyone is different and each person has their limits,\u201d says sober Cape Town mom Claire Choudhry. After reaching rock bottom in 2012, Claire decided to join Alcoholics Anonymous and sought help from her mother, who had also undergone treatment for alcoholism.\n\nSeven years down the line, Claire is now mom to Jack (5) and Harry (4) and keeps on top of her addiction by making sure she instils some self-care into her daily routine. \u201cIf I don\u2019t make time for myself every day, it affects me badly. The first two years of parenting were hard. At the time I was a full-time stay-at-home mom living in the UK and not close to family. But now that I\u2019m back South Africa and my kids are a bit older, it\u2019s getting easier. Sleep helps a lot!\u201d she says.\n\nDespite her history, Claire is not offended by moms who choose to drink, but she worries about the \u2018Wine Mom\u2019 stereotype and how it may be a trigger for those sensitive to abuse and addiction. \u201cDrinking daily can be dangerous because it can escalate into something you depend on. As moms, we all need to be careful and very aware of the risks.\u201d\n\nClaire admits that alcohol was a crutch and a coping mechanism for her, which was also true for her mother\u2019s addiction. \u201cBeing a mom is incredibly difficult, but I don\u2019t think alcohol should be the coping mechanism you use to deal with the pressures of parenting. It\u2019ll just take you nowhere fast \u2013 there are no real benefits. It shouldn\u2019t even be one of your options,\u201d she says.\n\nFor more on Claire\u2019s sobriety journey, tune in to her podcast, Gathered by Claire.\n\nChat back:\n\nAre you sober conscious?
