The coroner was so concerned by what she had heard that she filed a \u2018Report to Prevent Future Deaths\u2019 to the club, the local authority and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nShe said that unless further action was taken \u2018there is a risk further deaths will occur\u2019.\n\nIt can also be disclosed that one of the stewards involved told the three-day hearing he had taken the job because he was a United supporter. Now a security expert has warned that many of the stewards brought in on match-days simply see it as an opportunity to watch the team play.\n\n\u2018They get to watch football for free,\u2019 he said. \u2018If they don\u2019t have to deal with anything, it doesn\u2019t affect watching the football. They are not trained to a high level.\u2019\n\nSome of those who apply for the jobs also work nightclub doors and so have Security Industry Authority (SIA) licenses and a higher level of training. However, many receive only cursory training and are not licensed by the SIA and therefore cannot even search fans. Their training covers basics like first aid and how to direct supporters.\n\nSome regard it as an unwritten rule that because the pay is so low \u2014 little more than the minimum wage \u2014 they should be allowed to watch the match.\n\nUnited use an outside company, Controlled Solutions Group, to look after stewarding.\n\nMany Manchester United stewards do the job so they can watch the game, security experts say\n\nWhale fell down stairs in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand as he left a Manchester derby in 2017\n\nThey point out that the security elements of their staff are licensed by the SIA and say that both \u2018security and part-time stewarding staff are trained and continually evaluated to ensure they meet or exceed all industry standards\u2019.\n\nThe claims from the expert come after a fast-moving day of developments on which United finally revealed what safety improvements they have made in the wake of the tragedy.\n\nBoth the coroner, Alison Mutch OBE, and Trafford Council had written to United with a number of recommendations. United initially said they had made improvements but declined to disclose what they were. That led local MP Kate Green to say she would raise the matter in parliament should the club fail to make public what they had done.\n\nHowever, at 6pm following a repeated request by the Daily Mail, United eventually forwarded a list of measures taken after the death of Mr Whale.\n\nThey say they have brought in \u2018new configurations on the staffing and stewarding\u2019 of exit areas. They say stewards are briefed extensively on new guidelines brought in by the Sports Grounds Safety Authority following Mr Whale\u2019s death that call for exits to remain clear and add that they conduct briefings on the matter before \u2018every single game\u2019.\n\nThe concerned coroner was moved to write a 'Report to Prevent Future Deaths' to the club\n\nUnited, who insist \u2018safety is the number one priority\u2019 and point out that Old Trafford complied with all safety regulations at the time of Mr Whale\u2019s fall, were found by the coroner not to audit stewards and the club say they now carry out regular audits on the new procedures.\n\nThe club declined to say whether the two stewards involved in Mr Whale\u2019s death had been sacked or whether United would be widening the exits in the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand to meet current guidelines, although this is not a legal requirement.\n\nThe inquest jury recorded a verdict of accidental death but with three contributing factors, all of which concerned the actions of the two stewards who blocked his access to a handrail. One of them admitted they were watching the game instead of concentrating on the job at hand. Both were found to have a lack of awareness of their surroundings.\n\nEarlier in the day, Ms Green, MP for Stretford and Urmston, had called for transparency. \u2018I am very concerned,\u2019 she said. \u2018I know there is a lot of work that they carry out which is aimed at preventing a terrorist attack and I appreciate that a lot of this cannot be put into the public domain. However, in this case, they need to tell us what they have done. What have they got to hide?\n\nUnited have produced a list of measures taken to improve safety after the death of Mr Whale\n\n\u2018I would like to know in terms of basic safety what has been done, what is in the pipeline and when can we expect it to be completed? Our sports grounds need to be as safe as they possibly can be and this is something I will consider raising in parliament.\u2019\n\nTrafford council declined to comment on what recommendations they made but it is understood they included a request for United to make all their stewards aware of the code of conduct and to ensure that in the event of an accident, stewards fill in a report form before they finish their shifts. In Mr Whale\u2019s case, no report was filled out.\n\nMeanwhile, it is understood that the Premier League and EFL are reviewing training packages for stewards amid widespread concerns raised by police and fans over performance levels.\n\nThe Manchester United Supporters Trust has expressed concerns that the club are being left behind by failing to invest in their stadium. A spokesman said: \u2018We want so see the club investing for the future, off the pitch as well as on. Old Trafford should not be left behind.\u2019", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY MIKE KEEGAN AND IAN HERBERT: Many of Manchester United's stewards do the job to have the chance to watch their team play, security experts have claimed.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan", "Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19512382-0-image-a-32_1570656268508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
