She\u2019s doing two massive jobs.\n\n\u2018We only got into the studio yesterday and then I\u2019m gonna see her this afternoon and we\u2019re gonna work on it until late.\n\n\u2018She hasn\u2019t had a lot of time but she\u2019s such a hard worker and such a pro.\u2019\n\nAnton praised his \u2018hard working\u2019 partner Emma (Picture: PA)\n\nAnton has also had his first spray tan in readiness for the more revealing shirt he will put on for the Paso. And he cheekily admitted that his wife Hannah is a big fan.\n\n\u2018She has me parading around the bedroom with a dressing gown,\u2019 he joked.\n\nThe professional dancer was recently at the centre of probably one of the funniest moments of Strictly when judge Craig Revel Horwood mistakenly thought he was wearing false teeth for his Austin Powers inspired routine.\n\nAnton\u2019s teeth are all him, folks (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\nThe 53-year-old professional dancer has often been bundled with the older celebrity contestants in Strictly history, including the likes of Anne Widdecombe and Judy Murray.\n\nSo he was over the moon to be paired with Emma, saying during the show launch: \u2018So this is what it feels like. Oh book me in till Christmas.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018I apologise. I know it seemed a bit sort of over reaction, but if you\u2019ve been through what I\u2019ve been through, I can\u2019t begin to tell you.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays from 10.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
