It is harder in a professional services partnership.\n\nA zebra can no more change its stripes than a leopard its spots. The largesse of KPMG UK in the past extended to free phones for all and a party graced by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nNow the embattled accountancy firm has launched an economy drive named Project Zebra. KPMG aims to bring in zero-based budgeting (ZBB), the sort of nit-picking austerity it might usually recommend to clients but not adopt itself.\n\nThere are two small snags. First, ZBB does not work. Second, KPMG has always given short shrift to thrift.\n\nFans of ZBB over the years include former US president Jimmy Carter and Brazilian private equity firm 3G. The latter used it in the slash \u2019n\u2019 burn model that boosted margins at Anheuser-Busch InBev and other groups.\n\nZBB worked brilliantly there \u2014 until suddenly it didn\u2019t. Witness the spillage of ketchup and red ink at Kraft Heinz. This partly reflected big, blunt cost cuts at the foods group.\n\nKPMG\u2019s well-paid partners can do better at supper time than tinned macaroni. But austerity is the order of the day at work: cutting personal assistants and free phones to help save a modest \u00a3100 million ($192 million).", "description": "Zero-based budgeting is easy enough in a listed multinational controlled by private equity.
