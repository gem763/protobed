Moreover, Russia\u2019s failure to meet its output reduction commitment in September under theOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)+ alliance is building pressure on oil prices. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the factors that are keeping the oil price in check (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks to Bet on Ahead of Q3 Earnings).\n\nSlowing Global Economic Growth\n\nA slowdown in global economic growth is being observed since Trump waged the trade war with China. In fact, China\u2019s economic growth data has disappointed investors again. The world\u2019s second-largest economy\u2019s third-quarter GDP growth of 6% year over year was the slowest after first-quarter 1992. The economic growth rate also lagged expectations of 6.1%, per a Reuters\u2019 poll.\n\nMoreover, Japan has seen a decline in exports for the tenth straight month in September. Per data from the Ministry of Finance, exports fell 5.2% year over year in comparison to a 4% fall projected by economists. In terms of volumes, Japan exports contracted 2.3% between January and September. The Eurozone economy has been struggling with declining demand for goods and services, largely due to the trade war and Brexit issues. Also, the latest report on U.S. manufacturing, released by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) has failed to cheer investors. The ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) in the United States was the lowest in more than 10 years at 47.8% for September 2019.\n\nIMF Cuts Global Growth Outlook\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently cut global growth expectations for this year to the lowest since 2009. According to IMF, the global economy is expected to expand 3% this year in comparison to July\u2019s forecast of 3.2%. The global growth estimate for 2020 has also been slashed to 3.4% from 3.5%. Moreover, IMF expects growth in advanced economies to decline to 1.7% in 2019 from 2.3% in the previous year (read: Low-Volatility ETFs to Buy as IMF Cuts Global Growth Outlook).\n\nSlowing global economic growth, largely due to trade war tensions, has been the major reason for the fifth straight cut in global growth outlook. China's economic growth is expected to drop to 6.1% in 2019 from 6.6% last year. Moreover, the growth rate in the United States is expected to slow from 2.9% in the previous year to 2.4% in 2019.\n\nIn this regard, Gita Gopinath IMF\u2019s Chief Economist has mentioned in the report that \u201cwith a synchronized slowdown and uncertain recovery, the global outlook remains precarious.\u201d\n\nRising Output Levels\n\nRussia mentioned the rise in natural gas condensate output as the reason behind not being able to meet the promised supply reduction levels for September. Moreover, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are in discussion to restart oil production from joint fields in the Neutral Zone. If worked out, it will add 500,000 barrels to the market every day.\n\nOil ETFs in Focus\n\nThis has compelled many investors to take a closer look at the oil commodity space and related ETFs (see all Energy ETFs here).\n\nUnited States Brent Oil Fund BNO\n\nThe fund tracks the daily price movements of Brent crude oil (read: Oil ETFs in Focus as US, Russia & OPEC's Output Declines).\n\nAUM: $77.2 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.90%\n\nYTD Return: 18.2%\n\nUnited States Oil Fund USO\n\nThe United States Oil Fund seeks to track the daily price movement of WTI light, sweet crude oil (read: Top ETF Stories of Third Quarter).\n\nAUM: $1.33 billion\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.73%\n\nYTD Return: 16.2%\n\nInvesco DB Oil Fund DBO\n\nThe fund tracks changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the DBIQ Optimum Yield Crude Oil Index Excess Return plus the interest income from the holdings of primarily US Treasury securities and money market income less expenses (read: Profit From the Oil Rush With These ETFs).\n\nAUM: $266.1 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.78%\n\nYTD Return: 12.2%\n\nUS Commodity Funds United States 12 Month Oil USL\n\nThe fund replicates with possible accuracy the movement of West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude oil.\n\nAUM: $51.9 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.82%\n\nYTD Return: 13%\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
