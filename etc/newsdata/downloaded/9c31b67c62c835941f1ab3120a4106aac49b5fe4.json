Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was pretty much the line she has been getting away with offering for months, starting at a time when she was running well behind both former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nHer calculation was easy to understand. What Warren is trying to avoid was producing a sound bite that will play in thousands of Republican attack ads. And owning up to proposing a middle-class tax increase would undercut her rationale for running, which is as a populist who would reset a system in which everything favors the rich and the powerful.\n\nAD\n\nBut a front-runner, especially one who styles herself as a policy wonk, gets no passes.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., was the first to leap. \u201cThis is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,\u201d he told her. \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden accused her of being \u201cvague,\u201d and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) added: \u201cWe owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nBut the most devastating blow was delivered by Sanders. At the first debate in June, when he was still ahead of her in the polls, Warren had summed up her own stance on health care by saying, \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare-for-all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs somebody who wrote the damn bill, let\u2019s be clear: Under the Medicare-for-all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, copayments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday. Then he added: \u201cBut I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d including for middle-class Americans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the options that Sanders has listed for financing his plan is a 4 percent \u201cincome-based premium\u201d to be paid by households making more than $29,000 a year. He insists that the cost would be far lower than what they are paying in health insurance premiums, which would be eliminated under a government-financed system.\n\nWarren cannot put this question behind her by evading it. All she has done is guarantee that it will come up over and over again, and the longer she dodges, the more she will raise larger doubts about whether she is as forthright as she has portrayed herself to be.\n\nAt a critical moment when Americans have begun to take her measure as a real possibility to become the next president of the United States, Warren\u2019s job is to show not only that she has done her homework but also that she is someone they can trust. She should have a plan for that.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Her job is to show not only that she has done her homework but also that she is someone Americans can trust.", "authors": ["Karen Tumulty", "Columnist Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2s6us5tkn7_7XPfmjILN6SDY4t8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P2TDCRHQJAI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
