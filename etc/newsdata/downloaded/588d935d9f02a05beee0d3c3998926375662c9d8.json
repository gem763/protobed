Kansas. The state of Kansas has effectively eliminated the insanity defense. \u201cMental disease or defect is a defense to a prosecution under any statute,\u201d Kansas law says, only if it negates \u201cthe mental state require[ment] as an element of the offense charged.\u201d Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-3220 (2009). In other words, a defendant is always free to show that his insanity explains his innocence of the crime charged. But that\u2019s the only way insanity can be used. It\u2019s not an independent defense.\n\nHere\u2019s a hypothetical to see the difference. Imagine a person suffering from mental illness pushes a victim off a bridge. The victim falls to his death. The pusher is then charged with intentionally killing another human being. At trial, the defendant cannot argue to the jury that he is not guilty by reason of insanity because his mental illness impaired his ability to identify right from wrong or to conform his conduct to the law. For example, he can\u2019t argue that he heard voices telling him to kill the victim that he couldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nInstead, the defendant can only argue to the jury that his mental illness is the explanation for why he lacked the intent to kill and is therefore not guilty of an intentional killing. For example, he could argue that his mental disease meant that he wrongly believed his victim could fly: Because he didn\u2019t realize that pushing the victim off the bridge could harm him, he didn\u2019t cause the victim\u2019s death intentionally.", "description": "", "authors": ["Orin Kerr", "Reason.Com Can-States-Eliminate-The-Insanity-Defense"], "top_image": ""}
