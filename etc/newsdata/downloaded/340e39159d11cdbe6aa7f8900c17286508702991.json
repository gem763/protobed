In 2016, America Ferrera, Eva Longoria, Katy Perry and John Legend appeared in Nevada for Clinton, while Susan Sarandon rallied for Bernie Sanders and actor Donnie Wahlberg stumped for Marco Rubio.\n\nAfter appearing at the university, Kwan, 39, was expected to meet Thursday with members of the Las Vegas Asian American and Pacific Islander community and young Democrats, along with hosting a watch party for the Democratic debate in Houston.\n\nIn front of a tent at UNLV decked with Biden signs and a poster that read \u201cWelcome Michelle Kwan,\u201d the skater chatted with a handful of students who stopped by to register to vote, pick up Biden stickers or doughnuts and coffee.\n\nSeveral students, who were in elementary school when Kwan stopped competing, admitted they didn\u2019t know who she was, but some asked to pose for a picture with her anyway.\n\nKwan acknowledged that in an interview, saying she didn\u2019t expect the students to necessarily know who she was but she wanted to be one more voice engaging them about the debate and coming election.\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re not certain who they\u2019re going to vote for, but that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s starting a conversation,\u201d she said.\n\nFreshman Judie Olibrice, who posed for a picture with Kwan, said she\u2019s planning to cast her first vote next year for Biden because she thinks he\u2019s the candidate who is mostly likely to defeat President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cMy parents say that he could be a good shot,\u201d the 18-year-old said of Biden. \u201cI still haven\u2019t done my full research for him, but I feel like, you know, if my parents see he could be a good fit, might as well vote for him too.\u201d\n\nFreshman Nathan Allison, who said he stopped by the tent after noticing the crowd around Kwan, said he knows he will vote for a Democrat in 2020 but hasn\u2019t settled on which candidate he\u2019ll support. He said Biden is among his top choices, along with Sanders.\n\n\u201cI think that he could be a very good president,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of options there, and I think he\u2019s one of the best ones.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With a Joe Biden campaign button pinned on her blouse, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan smiled and posed for pictures Thursday on a busy walkway in the middle of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michelle L.
