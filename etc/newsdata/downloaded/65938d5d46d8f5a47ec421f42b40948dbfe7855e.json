On Thursday night, Elena Delle Donne stood at center court at Entertainment & Sports Arena, her home, which was perfectly fine. The spotlight fell to her, and she\u2019s accustomed to that by now because she is the best player on the WNBA\u2019s best team.\n\nBut as the public address announcer read through Delle Donne\u2019s list of accomplishments \u2014 which ended with her receiving the league\u2019s MVP award \u2014 the 6-foot-4, do-everything forward-guard looked as if she would have preferred to be in a dentist\u2019s chair. Anything to get back to her Washington Mystics teammates, who had more important business at hand.\n\n\u201cOur team,\u201d Delle Donne said, \u201cwe love each other.\u201d\n\nBy this point, the folks who fill this new arena in Southeast D.C. have long ago decided they loved Delle Donne. This is her third year here, and she has one hope: that her second MVP award is followed by her first WNBA championship.\n\nThe latest step came after that awkward pregame ceremony, a 103-91 victory over the Las Vegas Aces that gave the Mystics a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five semifinal series. That win guarantees those who have embraced Delle Donne will get at least one more glimpse of her at home \u2014 either in a potential Game 5 against Vegas next week or in the Mystics\u2019 second straight finals appearance, which looks increasingly likely.\n\nFor years, back-to-back finals for the Mystics would have seemed laughable. In 2011 and 2012, they combined for 11 wins. In 2016, the year before they traded for Delle Donne, they went 13-21 and missed the playoffs.\n\nSo she has been the leading lady in engineering the complete turnaround of a franchise. But she also has undergone a personal transformation from her early days with the Chicago Sky. Then, she won the 2015 MVP as a 26-year-old. By Thursday, she understood the award differently.\n\n[Meditations on an MVP season: Elena Delle Donne thrives with new approach]\n\n\u201cI feel like when I first got it, my eyes were wide open,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, this is the greatest thing ever,\u2019 not realizing that making my teammates better and trying to win championships is so much more that this. And somehow when you do that, you play great as a team and you make everyone else around you better, it makes your job easier and somehow this trophy comes along with it sometimes.\u201d\n\nThis is not only to appreciate what we have here but to appreciate that there\u2019s time left to enjoy it this fall. That Delle Donne is the Mystics\u2019 first MVP might qualify as an obscure fact, as telling about her excellence since she arrived, via trade with Chicago, before the 2017 season as it is about the Mystics\u2019 struggles before she put on their uniform. Washington entered the playoffs as the favorite for the title for a variety of reasons \u2014 overall talent, versatility, explosiveness, experience, coaching. None of those reasons matter without Delle Donne.\n\nSo as she stood at center court before Thursday\u2019s game, posing for photos with WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and the MVP trophy \u2014 longing to get back to her teammates and get to tip-off \u2014 it was worth considering where she fits among stars in Washington. Is any D.C. pro athlete performing at a higher level?\n\nThis is not a question for Delle Donne.\n\n\u201cI just let my play speak for itself,\u201d she said, \u201cand you guys get to decide that.\u201d\n\nFine. Let\u2019s go.\n\nFirst of all, MVP awards are pretty rare around here. Bryce Harper won the National League\u2019s honor in 2015, but he doesn\u2019t play here anymore. Alex Ovechkin has three Hart Trophies as the NHL\u2019s MVP, but the most recent came in 2013. Ovi\u2019s accomplishments are unassailable now because he followed those Harts by hoisting the Stanley Cup. But in a younger, faster league, a 34-year-old isn\u2019t likely to be the best player.\n\nThe football team\u2019s last MVP? That would be Joe Theismann in 1983. Yeah, John Wall and Bradley Beal were both courtside Thursday night, and they have been, at various points in their careers, among the NBA\u2019s best players. But the only MVP in the franchise history of the Washington Wizards was Wes Unseld, back in 1969, when they were the Bullets and they played in Baltimore. D.C. United\u2019s biggest star is Englishman Wayne Rooney, but he\u2019s a short-timer, done with Washington after this season.\n\nSo Delle Donne fits in there, comfortably. Maybe Anthony Rendon\u2019s massive 2019 with the Nationals will result in the MVP (as it should). Rose Lavelle was the breakout star of the Women\u2019s World Cup, is the future of American soccer and plays right here for the Washington Spirit.\n\nThe point: You have to reach to find a Washington athlete having more of an impact on her or his team and her or his league than Delle Donne. And the reality is, you probably won\u2019t find one.\n\n\u201cElena Della Donne\u2019s the MVP because she affects every aspect of the box score,\u201d guard Natasha Cloud said.\n\n[Mystics turn back Aces again, take 2-0 lead in WNBA semifinals]\n\nThat was the reality Thursday, when Delle Donne wasn\u2019t in a rhythm. She missed 10 of her 15 shots, including all three of her three-pointers. Two days after opening the playoffs with 24 points, she had just 14.\n\nAnd yet it was an MVP-worthy performance. She had 10 boards. She hit the shot midway through the third quarter that put the Mystics up for good. With the Aces rallying and less than five minutes left in the game, she made an athletic and impressive block of Vegas forward A\u2019ja Wilson.\n\n\u201cActually, in some ways, this game kind of epitomized [the award] because she didn\u2019t have a good shooting game,\u201d Coach Mike Thibault said. \u201cAnd yet people are running to double-team her, and she\u2019s finding somebody else. She gets double figure rebounds. She comes up with a big blocked shot down the stretch. Those other things are things nobody ever thinks about her. . . .\n\n\u201cShe knew she wasn\u2019t in a good rhythm. So she gave up herself partly to be a decoy. . . . She has willingly done that because it helps our team win. That\u2019s the Elena Delle Donne that\u2019s the MVP.\u201d\n\nWithout Delle Donne\u2019s best shooting game, the Mystics can survive because of Emma Meesseman and Cloud and Kristi Toliver and others.\n\nWith her? With her, they have a star, a focal point, a player who can combine the sound with the spectacular. Take a look at her and the trophy she now deservedly holds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more inspiring to know that there\u2019s little girls looking up to me that are maybe dreaming of doing the same or doing more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did when I was younger because I had them to look up to, and to now think I\u2019m in a position to inspire others is a really cool feeling, and something that still gives me chills.\u201d\n\nThe real chills could come this fall. The MVP was a step in solidifying Delle Donne\u2019s legacy in Washington and her standing among this city\u2019s athletes. But the championship, that would matter more. In that sense, Thursday\u2019s win was more important than any ancillary hardware. Just let Elena Delle Donne get back to her teammates, where she\u2019s comfortable.", "description": "On a night when she captured the ultimate award for an individual, she remains all about the team in a Game 2 win over Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CALaLIfO-R53hcDrZtOprDxdToE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OHQL2G3GUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
