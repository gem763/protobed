(AP) - Sloppy on offense. Stingy on defense.\n\nLike it or not, Bills coach Sean McDermott is going to require patience in dealing with a 3-1 team that has two sides of the ball in entirely different stages of development.\n\nMcDermott spoke to that situation when responding to a question about Zay Jones\u2019 struggles adjusting to his new role among a revamped group of receivers.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at our defense and offense, there\u2019s different levels of continuity,\u201d McDermott said Monday, a day after the Bills committed four turnovers and squandered a stout defensive effort in a 16-10 loss to New England.\n\n\u201cThe defense is a year, a year-and-a-half ahead in terms of continuity,\u201d he added. \u201cOffensively, we\u2019ve got eight, nine new players just in the starting lineup.\u201d\n\nIt shows.\n\nThe Bills overcame their deficiencies in rallying from deficits to win each of their first three games. It was a different story against the defending Super Bowl champions and division rivals who have now defeated Buffalo 34 times in their past 39 meetings.\n\nThe Bills lost a game in which its defense limited Tom Brady to a touchdown and field goal, 11 first downs and forcing nine punts in one of the quarterback\u2019s worst statistical performances in 13 years.\n\nDefensive coordinator Leslie Frazier insists his unit, which returns 10 starters , has to be better.\n\n\u201cJust search deep and hard and figure out more things that we can possibly do,\u201d he said, noting Buffalo managed just one takeaway with Micah Hyde intercepting Brady in the end zone.\n\nIn the meantime, the Josh Allen-led offense is expected to continue enduring its share of growing pains - with, and perhaps, without the second-year quarterback in the coming weeks.\n\nAllen\u2019s status is uncertain for this weekend\u2019s game at Tennessee. He was placed in the concussion protocol following a helmet-to-helmet hit by New England\u2019s Jonathan Jones in the opening minute of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe injury put an abrupt end to one of the second-year quarterback\u2019s worst performances, while furthering an ongoing trend of Allen being careless with the ball.\n\nHe threw three interceptions - all on first-down situations - to increase his turnover total to eight (six interceptions, two lost fumbles) this season. Two of those turnovers translated into nine points as the Patriots built a 13-0 lead through the first quarter.\n\nAnd then there was Allen\u2019s inability to get rid of the ball in a game he was sacked four times - three coming inside the Patriots 35. One sack for a 5-yard loss was immediately followed by Stephen Hauschka missing a 49-yard field attempt wide left. Another sack for a 7-yard loss pushed Buffalo out of field goal position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more concerning than frustrating,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to continue to learn.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nA run defense that allowed just 74 yards against New England, after giving up 273 in its previous meeting - a 24-12 loss on Dec. 23. Buffalo has held three of four opponents under 75 yards rushing already, one fewer time than all last season.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nGame management. Buffalo used its three second-half timeouts by the opening play of the fourth quarter, when Allen called time facing third-and-8 at New England\u2019s 45. The first one was used with 6:10 left in the third quarter on defense, and the second on the second of McDermott\u2019s two failed challenges. Josh Gordon\u2019s 31-yard catch on third-and-6 was allowed to stand following a review for offensive pass interference.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nReceiver/returner Andre Roberts appears to be over a quadriceps injury that forced him to sit out Buffalo\u2019s first two games. The first-team All-Pro last year returned six punts for 77 yards, including a 13-yarder, and even got involved on offense with a 6-yard catch.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nJones is showing no signs of building off last season, when the 2017 second-round draft pick led Buffalo in catches (56), yards (652) and seven touchdowns. Thus far, he has seven catches for 69 yards. Against New England, Jones managed just two catches for 4 yards despite being targeted eight times, including two that resulted in Allen interceptions.\n\nINJURED\n\nAllen and S Dean Marlowe are in the concussion protocol. RB Devin Singletary is closer to returning after missing past two games with a strained left hamstring.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n109 - The number of yards Frank Gore had against the Patriots in becoming the NFL\u2019s second-oldest player to top 100. He did it at the age of 36 years, 138 days. MacArthur Lane of the Kansas City Chiefs was 36 years, 199 days when he had 144 yards rushing in a 28-13 loss at Buffalo on Oct. 1, 1978.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Bills seek to rebound by facing the Tennessee Titans (2-2) on Sunday, before entering their bye week off. Buffalo has shot to open 4-1 for first time since 2011.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sloppy on offense.
