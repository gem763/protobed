It's pretty impressive stuff!\n\nBut anyone who's used a Nintendo Switch as a portable console is well aware of its potential issues: Using the detachable controllers (\"Joy-Con\") to hold the console feels fraught, as if you'll inevitably break the device. And as you use it more, the Joy-Cons feel less secure.\n\nAnd in a more straightforward sense, the original Switch is just a large device.\n\nWith the Switch Lite, all of those issues disappear. It's a smaller handheld, and the Joy-Cons are attached. It feels lighter because it is lighter. It feels easier to take on the go because it's explicitly built for portable use.\n\nSimply put: The Switch Lite is better at being a handheld console than the original Switch, and with good reason.", "description": "A new Nintendo Switch is now available, and it's the least expensive way to jump into Nintendo's best console in years.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e4a0a2e22af78fa147154?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
