It may not even do that instantly for everyone, given that services like the Xbox and PlayStation stores rely on huge infrastructure.\n\nOnce it does arrive, the demo won't actually be available to play until it is properly downloaded and installed onto the console. That could happen very quickly or very slowly indeed, depending on the speed of your connection and the bandwidth that the stores make available, as well as the speed of the device it is being installed onto.\n\nEA Sports hasn't revealed much about what will be in the demo, beyond two features: Volta Football, which brings back the beloved FIFA Street-style play, and 11v11 kick-off.\n\nIt hasn't revealed what teams will be included or whether it will allow a glimpse at other parts of the game.\n\nFor all the latest on the demo release \u2013 and to be alerted when it's out \u2013 click here for our live coverage.", "description": "The Fifa 20 demo is finally about to arrive,\u00a0within hours.
