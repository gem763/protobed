Here it doesn\u2019t matter if your medical aid has run out or your bank balance is severely in the red \u2013 no one is turned away. And no one is asked to pay a cent more than they can afford.\n\nWalk-in Doctor, Paulo\u2019s small practice in an old house on Kellner Street, is exactly what the name says: a practice where anyone can walk in and be treated. And the doctor and his rooms have become quite a sensation in the community.\n\n\u201cWe read about Dr Paulo and his practice on Facebook,\u201d says one mom, who\u2019s brought her son to be treated for an ear infection.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about him. \u201cIf you show up at an ordinary GP you spend five minutes in his consulting rooms, he gives you medication and charges you an arm and a leg.\n\n\u201cHere the doctor makes time for you. He wants to get to know his patients. And afterwards you pay what you can afford, and he gives you the necessary medication.\u201d\n\nPaulo works on a first-come, first-serve basis and doesn\u2019t believe in draining your bank account. Patients pay what they can afford \u2013 whether it be R50 or R350.\n\nPatients might have to wait a while but it\u2019s par for the course. This doctor believes in paying it forward and it\u2019s made him quite the go-to guy in the area.\n\nA man and a woman are just leaving the practice. The woman fastens her coat buttons to ward off the icy wind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s snowing on the Lesotho mountains,\u201d she says, blowing on her hands to warm them. She used to be a receptionist, but she\u2019s been struggling to find work for the past year.\n\n\u201cGetting decent healthcare if you don\u2019t have an income is virtually impossible. At state clinics you can end up waiting for eight hours before seeing a doctor. And they just shove a bunch of pain pills in your hand on sight.\n\n\u201cHere I get good-quality healthcare and the right medication \u2013 and I pay what I can afford.\u201d\n\nShe paid R50 for her consultation and antibiotics to fight her flu, she says. \u201cIf I find a job I\u2019ll definitely pay more.\u201d Nthabiseng Direko is sitting in the waiting room, waiting for her friend who\u2019s in with Paulo.\n\n\u201cShe woke up with a numb arm and one side of her face was swollen,\u201d she tells us. \u201cWe found out about Dr Paulo on Facebook and since we live here in Westdene we decided to come see him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a blessing in our community,\u201d she says. \u201cAs the Bible says, \u2018Give, and it shall be given unto you\u2019 \u2013 and Dr Paulo will be rewarded for his charity. He\u2019s a gift to Bloemfontein.\u201d\n\nNthabiseng\u2019s friend emerges from the consulting room, smiling brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s high blood pressure,\u201d she declares.\n\nShe and Nthabiseng walk over to reception to pay her fee. That\u2019s how it works here. Paulo examines his patients first and afterwards the patient decides how much his consultation is worth.\n\nThen they\u2019re also given the medication. Paulo (58), who\u2019s of Portuguese descent, appears in the waiting room, wearing a neat button-down shirt and carrying a clipboard under his arm. He shows us to his consulting room.\n\nThere are paintings on the wall and everything is neatly in its place. We take a seat in the leather chair opposite his desk and he leans forward, resting his elbows on the glass top of his desk.\n\nHe and his parents arrived in Johannesburg from Mozambique in 1974 and set about building a new life for themselves. After school Paulo worked in bottle stores and bars and later entered the banking sector \u2013 but he\u2019d always dreamt of becoming a doctor and helping people.\n\nIn 2005 he decided to fulfil his dream and started studying for a medical degree at the University of the Free State (UFS) in Bloemfontein.\n\n\u201cI was 44 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as I know I\u2019m the oldest person to study medicine at UFS.\u201d After completing his mandatory year of community service, he started practising in Bryanston, Johannesburg, in 2014.\n\nHe returned to Bloemfontein last year where he worked in the UFS\u2019 chemical pathology department. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to help people from all walks of life,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe system of people paying whatever they can afford was an idea I\u2019d been toying with for a while. I then decided to use my savings to open the practice.\u201d Walk-in Doctor opened its doors in the first week of June this year.\n\nHe says it\u2019s not only the cash-strapped who use his services. \u201cSome people have only a hospital plan and others have a medical fund that\u2019s depleted.\n\nI accept everyone at my practice.\u201d But isn\u2019t he afraid of people abusing his system? \u201cThere\u2019s no system to abuse,\u201d he declares.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no minimum amount. And if people can pay R350 but they pay only R50, it\u2019s on their conscience and is between them and God. \u201cWe\u2019ve been put on this planet to look after one another and not just ourselves.\u201d\n\nPaulo, who\u2019s divorced and has three adult children, buys the antibiotics and basic medication he prescribes his patients in bulk, which makes it more affordable.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t work with medical aids \u2013 this is a cash-only practice.\u201d He has one ironclad rule: he doesn\u2019t treat children younger than seven. \u201cChildren need to go to a paediatrician who specialises in early childhood development,\u201d he says.\n\nPaulo often appears as an expert guest on the talk show Real Health broadcast on The Home Channel (DStv channel 176). \u201cIt\u2019s not only important to be able to diagnose and treat illnesses but also to educate people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no wisdom if you\u2019re overweight and you sit at a fast food restaurant and polish off three burgers and four glasses of cola.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be taught to live healthily and that\u2019s part of our job description as doctors.\u201d Though he finds the sudden popularity of his humble practice a little overwhelming, he doesn\u2019t exclude the possibility of expansion.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be taught to live healthily and that\u2019s part of our job description as doctors.\u201d Though he finds the sudden popularity of his humble practice a little overwhelming, he doesn\u2019t exclude the possibility of expansion.", "description": "Dr Paulo: \"We've been put on this earth to look after one another\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/fb08e7fa58a64a87ade955dfbf35f159.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
