It is an important early test for Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who was elected this year after a campaign in which she called for more nurses and social workers in the city\u2019s schools \u2014 some of the very changes Chicago\u2019s teachers are seeking now.\n\nThe city and the Chicago Teachers Union, which represents more than 20,000 educators, had been in tense contract negotiations for months, and there had been signs of progress in recent days. But as a midnight deadline approached on Wednesday with no deal, Ms. Lightfoot canceled Thursday classes and both sides signaled that a walkout was inevitable.", "description": "The Chicago Teachers Union and the city\u2019s new mayor failed to reach a contract deal.
