(AP) - Robert Campbell was thoroughly soaked, shivering, his wet sleeping bag covering him in the only shelter he could find \u2014 a pit toilet in a closed campground \u2014 after getting lost in a snowstorm in Oregon while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.\n\nCampbell was saved on Friday by a search team from the local sheriff\u2019s department, who found his footprints in the snow. Heavy snow was forecast through Saturday evening in the Cascade Range.\n\n\u201cI really think I owe them my life because \u2026 I couldn\u2019t have made it another night. My sleeping bag and tent are just completely soaked and probably ruined and I have no dry clothes,\u201d Campbell said from a motel Friday night in Detroit, Oregon. His voice hoarse, he noted there were blue spots on one foot and his toenails were blue.\n\nCampbell, a native of the Philadelphia area, started hiking the famed Pacific Crest Trail on the U.S.-Mexican border on May 4, determined to make it all the way to the other end, on the Canadian border, 2,650 miles (4,265 kilometers) away. Last year, he hiked the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine, he said. Those who walk the entire distance of these multi-state trails are called thru-hikers.\n\nCampbell\u2019s troubles began Wednesday night. Snow was falling, the first winter storm of the season. He stayed awake all night, punching the interior tent walls to knock the accumulating snow off.\n\nAs he hiked on Thursday, the snow buried the trail. A smartphone app that was supposed to show the way didn\u2019t help. Straying miles off the trail and into a boulder field, he stepped into a crack hidden in the snow, trapping his foot. He struggled for five minutes and had to unlace his shoe before he could free himself, Campbell said.\n\nMany take up the challenge to hike the PCT. Cheryl Strayed was one. She wrote a book, \u201cWild,\u201d about her adventure that was made into a movie starring Reese Witherspoon.\n\n\u201cSometimes it seemed that the Pacific Crest Trail was one long mountain I was ascending,\u201d Strayed wrote. \u201cAt times I almost wept with the relentlessness of it, my muscles and lungs searing with the effort.\u201d\n\nHikers have a strong sense of camaraderie. The Trek website shows thru-hikers triumphantly standing on a wooden sign marking the trail\u2019s northern terminus.\n\nSome perish making the attempt.\n\nIn 2017, heavy snowfall made conditions treacherous. The body of Chaocui Wang, who had quit her job in Shanghai, China, to hike the trail, was found in a creek made swift by melting snowpack. Thru-hiker Rika Moria, of Osaka Japan, was found dead in a river. Hiker Marvin Novo, of Turlock, California, died from apparent heat-related causes. In February, another hiker died after falling on ice.\n\nHiker Finn Bastian, of Preetz, Germany, was killed this year by a falling tree.\n\nCampbell, scared after being temporarily trapped and realizing he needing help, called 911 on Thursday and said he was lost. Then the line dropped. There was no phone signal. The Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office sent out a search and rescue team, putting out a notice saying \u201cthe area of focus is very expansive and there is limited information available.\u201d\n\nCampbell, meanwhile, stumbled into the campground. Tire tracks gave hope that some lingering vacationers might be present, but the place was empty. Cold, wet and exhausted, he ducked into a pit toilet, the only available shelter. On Friday afternoon, searchers drove by the campground and found his footprints.\n\n\u201cThey just went way above and beyond. I\u2019m just eternally grateful,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nHe intends to finish the hike.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, Canada or bust,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be doing it a lot more smartly. Any chance of snow, I\u2019m not going to even mess around with it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Robert Campbell was thoroughly soaked, shivering, his wet sleeping bag covering him in the only shelter he could find -- a pit toilet in a closed campground -- after getting lost in a snowstorm in Oregon while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Selsky"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
