While it is typically a feature in movies, paintings, and games, it often goes unrecognized or unappreciated. I think this is because most of us have started taking the buildings we spend our time in for granted.\n\nWe go into our dull, grey, boxy offices and we leave at the end of the day, never once taking the time to notice our surroundings, or asking ourselves if whoever made this building had me in mind. Probably not; most buildings nowadays are built to be cheap, fast, and accessible.\n\nBut what if there was a new way of making you pay attention to the buildings around you; one that makes the architecture so bold and so invasive that we can\u2019t help but notice it.\n\nThat is what Remedy has done with their latest game: Control.\n\n\u201cPeople ignore design that ignores people,\u201d Frank Chimero said.\n\nI am fascinated by buildings; they have permeated every aspect of my life and I\u2019ve loved them for as long as I can remember. Be warned that if you and I are grabbing a drink together, you might lose my attention to the beautifully-crafted truss-system holding up the roof.\n\nI can\u2019t remember a time in my life where I didn\u2019t have this obsession. I was always drawn to every clean line or interesting angle that framed a building\u2019s form. Curved walls led to big reveals, and every door always hid a mystery. A natural love of architecture translated into a passion for movies as well. If you told me that a film\u2019s setting is in a Modernist home or an International style pavilion, I was hooked.\n\nThis obsession, however, also led to some frustration. Why were none of my other friends appreciating architecture like I was? I\u2019m reminded of a particularly painful sleepover in middle school where I can remember hearing that I would have to shut up or leave if I didn\u2019t stop going on about how faithfully crafted the Art Deco world of the Bioshock series was. I wondered how so many people could play this game and not realize that the story was the architecture.\n\nIt struck me then that maybe the reason the architecture was still going unnoticed was that it still wasn\u2019t real. While being based on an authentic architectural style, there wasn\u2019t anyone out there building the next American version of Atlantis.\n\nIt would take a game where the architecture is real, something that anyone could experience anytime they wanted. We all, whether actively or passively, consider the buildings in our lives as living things. Remedy\u2019s latest project was able to bring this feeling into my living room by making the Oldest House a character, and not just a setting.\n\nIn a game where you play a pseudo-psychic government agent spending your time flying through the air and smashing your enemies under tons of concrete while defending the planet from an otherworldly invasion, you wouldn\u2019t expect a big ugly box to take center stage.\n\nYet it does, and in an incredibly powerful way. But that\u2019s the whole point of the Oldest House; it looms over you, it dominates you, it is always there whether you like it or not, just like the style it was fashioned after is intended to. The strong sense of enclosure that you feel in Control is based on many buildings that exist right under your nose.\n\nCredit: Control\n\nBrutalist architecture, or Brutalism, is a polarizing style of design made up of bare materials, clean lines, and a feeling of power. I have never played a game where those features are so intricately placed and showcased in the game design. Control\u2019s sparse use of color often highlights these notable elements. Everything is solid, flat, and bristling with texture. You can almost feel the rough, cold concrete surfaces around you \u2014 we\u2019ve all been in places like this at some point in our lives. To that end, there\u2019s something familiar about The Oldest House. This might be due to the fact that every school you\u2019ve ever been in (at least in America) has been designed to directly reflect the Brutalist style; in fact, most institutional buildings have been designed this way. The intention is to make you feel safe and secure \u2014 or perhaps, in some circumstances, to make you feel contained or even controlled. Where are you supposed to go, after all, if thick, concrete walls surround you? There is a polarization at the heart of Brutalism \u2014 simplicity and freedom versus confinement and imprisonment. Love it or hate it, it\u2019s there, and it will always be there. Or at least, that\u2019s what the architects intended you to think and feel. \u201cAn object should be judged by whether it has a form consistent with its use,\u201d said Bruno Munari. Admittedly, I find the style beautiful \u2014 but what if you hate it? Well, interestingly, Control gives you an architect\u2019s dream game mechanic: destruction. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they just knock it down and start over?\u201d Everyone has said this at one point or another. Driving through town or walking down the sidewalk, you\u2019ve inevitably seen a building that made you wonder why anyone would want to build it. Perhaps this is how you feel about Brutalism \u2014 but at least the style caught your attention, right? That\u2019s one reason why Control is so brilliant. It forces you to engage with the world around you by appreciating its beauty or smashing it to bits. I like ruins because what remains is not the total design, but the clarity of thought, the naked structure, the spirit of the thing,\u201d Tadao Ando said. Most architects will tell you that buildings tell a story through their construction. Control tells you its story through de-construction. We need more games like this \u2014 games that focus not only on architecture, but our intense personal relationship to the spaces around us, especially how we interact with them. Control echoes a walking simulator where you\u2019re allowed to meander through your favorite museum \u2014 the difference, of course, is that here you can set your most hated pieces of art on fire, and I think that\u2019s beautiful.
