Worried by the risk of unreliable supply, the Morrison government has initiated an underwriting program to encourage new on-demand power plants.\n\nMr Calabria described the retailers' obligation as a positive move but said there was no certainty it would drive investment into new on-demand power plants such as fast-start gas power and pumped hydro.\n\n\"We think that's been a positive development,\" he said.\n\n\"The question we have got is whether it will be a strong enough one that will have capital flow into the market.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the result of the Renewable Energy Target legislation, which has spurred a surge of investment in new wind and solar plants, showed that firm rules worked.\n\nOrigin's Frank Calabria: \"The mere existence of the big stick is acting as handbrake on investment.\" Dominic Lorrimer\n\n\"If the rules are set, you will get investment to flow,\" he said.\n\nBut investments in firm gas peaking power have been scarce, since Origin's investment in the Mortlake plant in Victoria in 2011 and AGL Energy's commitment to build its Barker Inlet plant in South Australia, which is replacing an ageing gas plant that is being shut down.\n\nMr Calabria said that in today's market, the government's Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) scheme was the only thing that would drive investment in new on-demand power.\n\n\"Today it's going to be the UNGI; it's the short-term measure being focused on and obviously retaining Liddell,\" he said.\n\n\"But in the longer term you've got to let the market do that and I don't see beyond those existing measures what it is that is giving confidence that we would invest further.\n\n\"The government intervention does not give confidence in a rules-based system because the rules are continuously changing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Calabria said Origin continued to look at potential investments in new firm generation but remained wary.\n\n\"We continue to look at the investments across that but we are quite cautious about how we allocate capital into that without a greater signal,\" he said.\n\n'Missing ingredient'\n\nHe said an emissions reduction scheme or energy intensity scheme was the \"missing ingredient\" in policy.\n\n\"Ultimately someone has to set emissions reduction over time because it's the missing ingredient,\" he said.\n\nMr Calabria said later that he still wasn't sure whether the National Electricity Market needed an overhaul to introduce a \"capacity\" market, where power plant owners would be paid to keep plants available even if no generation was taking place.", "description": "Origin Energy's chief executive Frank Calabria has given a bleak assessment on the investment climate for new firm generating plants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3686%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_156%2C$y_269/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ebe4519d0cc5f80b9feff902c423dbeb1347df34", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
