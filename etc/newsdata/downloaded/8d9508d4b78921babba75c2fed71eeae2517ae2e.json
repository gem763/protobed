A broad-brush approach will not identify the root causes of this particular type of racism which has infected the party. It will look merely at the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe prime minister must listen to the victims of Islamophobia, both inside and outside the party, and the first step towards tackling the issue is to hold an inquiry specifically to understand its extent. With many Muslims already having lost faith in the party, it must get this inquiry right to ensure it is not just a rubber-stamping exercise, but an honest attempt at fixing a significant problem.\n\nTo get this right, the inquiry must be truly independent and external. An internal investigation lacks the incentive to look into the issues fully and accurately.\n\nFinally, the inquiry must review the party\u2019s investigatory and disciplinary processes, to see whether these could have enabled the party to deal with complaints of more Islamophobia effectively, and whether these procedures are being followed properly.\n\nSome recent cases of members found to be posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online have been dealt with swiftly by the party, which suspended those members immediately. In other cases, like with Zac Goldsmith\u2019s Islamophobic mayoral campaign, the party can brush it under the carpet and promote him to cabinet.\n\nThis mixed bag approach is not only incoherent but sends a message to Conservatives that those at the top can hold these deeply bigoted views and still remain at the top, but those lower down the ladder will be ostracised.\n\nLaunching this inquiry is not difficult, especially when the evidence for its need and the way in which it should be conducted is so widely documented.\n\nAs Johnson came into office, he heralded the appointment of one of the most diverse cabinets in history, including the country's first Muslim Chancellor of the Exchequer. But there is no point in making appointments that represent a powerful and symbolic statement if the system and the nation's citizens are discriminated against.\n\nThe least the Conservative Party could do is to truly listen to and thoroughly engage with Muslim communities. Having already marginalised many Muslims over its failure to address Islamophobia so far, the party has a long way to go to win back trust, but it certainly needs to make the first move. Failing to do so would further disenfranchise Muslims.\n\nThe serial inaction by the Conservative Party to tackle the issue of Islamophobia amongst its ranks, despite the constant pressure, moral obligation and absence of any real reason not to, is demoralising, disappointing and frankly, unacceptable.\n\nHarun Khan is the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain", "description": "During the Conservative leadership election, all candidates committed to holding a specific inquiry into Islamophobia.
