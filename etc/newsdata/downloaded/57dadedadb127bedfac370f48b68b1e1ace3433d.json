Though the emotional statements from the victims\u2019 families had drawn tears from many in the gallery, as well as from his two co-defendants, Lampley \u2013 who goes by Haze \u2013 kept his expressionless stare focused on the table in front of him, just as he had for the majority of the legal proceedings.\n\nDavid Brown had worn a similar mask over the past year and a half, one of practiced stoicism shaped from years of courtroom experience.\n\nBut on the day Haze Lampley, his teenage girlfriend, and his longtime acquaintance were to be sentenced for the murders of 23-year-old Audrey Carey and 67-year-old Steve Carter, Brown spoke to the court with the candor of an attorney who knew that his client was about to spend the rest of his life in prison. Brown laid out the brutal reality of Haze\u2019s twenty-four years on this earth: the neglect, the homelessness, the abuse, the mental illness. He was \u201cdeprived of everything a child needs\u201d, Brown said, dosed with LSD as a toddler, shooting up drugs by the age of eleven. A psychiatrist once described him as a \u201cferal child\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaze would have fared no worse or no better if he had been dropped off on a street corner after he was born,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThen he turned to the front row of the gallery, where the victims\u2019 families sat.\n\n\u201cThis is not offered as an excuse,\u201d Brown said to them, \u201cbut as an attempt to understand why we\u2019re all here.\u201d\n\nWhat \u201chere\u201d meant differed for each person in the courtroom that day. For the family members of Steve Carter, a respected tantra instructor who had moved back to California to support his wife through chemotherapy, and Audrey Carey, a free-spirited young girl with a bright future, \u201chere\u201d was a hell created by three monsters \u2013Haze Lampley; his 19-year-old girlfriend, Lila Scott Alligood; and Sean Angold, their 25-year-old friend \u2013 for whom no amount of prison time could make up for the lives they stole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like those people just killed Steve,\u201d said Lokita Carter, Steve\u2019s widow. \u201cThey killed a huge chunk of me. They killed a whole other part of another human being.\u201d\n\nIn a statement read at the sentencing by a prosecutor, Audrey\u2019s mother, Isabelle Tremblay, denounced all three as \u201cproof that evil exists\u201d. \u201cYou are not human beings,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHer statement was an emotional, stinging barb, pulled from a deep place of grief to pierce into the hearts of the ones to whom it was directed. Lila sobbed through the reading, her attorney patting her on the back, while Sean kept his head down, his eyes damp. But months later, Haze shrugged at the vitriol directed at him and his two co-defendants that day. \u201cUnspeakable monsters\u201d, Isabelle Tremblay had called them. It wasn\u2019t the first time, Haze said, that he\u2019d been called a monster.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even the first time he had been called such as it pertained to this case. Throughout the proceedings, observers and those with knowledge of the case dismissed Haze as a \u201cpsychopath\u201d, an amoral creature sowing chaos everywhere he turned. They remarked on his \u201cdead\u201d eyes, his blank stare, the way he never reacted to anything in court.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morrison Haze Lampley at a hearing in September 2016.

In the realm of culpability, he had the most blood on his hands, they said, and that was reflected in the charges and sentencing. Sean was sentenced to 15 years to life for the murder of solely Steve Carter, as part of the plea deal for his testimony. Lila was sentenced to 50 years to life, while Haze received a one-hundred-year sentence.\n\nA \u201cmonster\u201d, they called him, but before his attorney\u2019s statement at the sentencing, few had stopped to consider what had made him this way. Few had stopped to consider what sort of life he had lived that had allowed him to deem it acceptable to rob two strangers at gunpoint, knowing full well that any misstep could end in bloodshed. Few had stopped to consider the sort of misfortunes that had shaped him into the type of young man who could witness up close the gore from one murder and still feel unaffected enough to pull the trigger on a second human being just days later. And even fewer had stopped to consider that the misfortunes that had made Haze who he is today are the same ones that have driven countless kids to a life of aimless homelessness \u2013 that the demons that haunt Haze, Lila, and Sean are the same that haunt the youth we pass on the streets every day, squatting along city sidewalks amid a cloud of body odor and marijuana smoke.\n\nThe Californians forced to live in cars and RVs Read more\n\nBecause for Haze, Lila, and Sean, \u201chere\u201d was the abrupt end of a complicated and treacherous journey through their youth, one riddled with violence, drug use, terror, and crime. \u201cHere\u201d was the last stop of an unforgiving path on which millions of kids, teenagers, and young adults find themselves traveling each day, wandering across the country with little more than the packs on their back and nowhere to call home.\n\nThe tearful sentencing unfolded in the same courthouse that had been made famous by Angela Davis and the Black Panthers in the 1970s. Located in the heart of Marin county, the Civic Center is an architectural marvel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, all chic curves and sleek glass atria. As the crime reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, I had spent a chunk of the 18 months it took to reach this point in the case crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with other local journalists in a modish wood-paneled courtroom, scribbling down every gruesome, bloody detail of the killings under a bizarre spherical light fixture that reminded me of a cartoon spaceship. At times, being in that stylized courtroom felt like stepping into a topsy-turvy alternate reality \u2013 at the center of which sat Haze, Lila, and Sean. Eighteen months prior, deputies had marched them into the courtroom, all in their jail-issued striped jumpsuits and with their heads shaved \u2013 authorities had said they had bugs living in their tangled, matted hair when they arrived in Marin county. For a short time, their bald heads added another surreal layer to an already surreal situation.\n\nWe at the Chronicle began referring to Haze, Lila, and Sean as \u201cthe drifters\u201d pretty much from the start, and the term caught on with other news outlets as well. All the media coverage made a point to reference their youth \u2013 at the time of their arrest in October 2015, Lila had just turned 23, while Haze and Sean were 23 and 24, respectively. At 26, I was just a few years older than they were when this all began, yet as I sat there in that courtroom, 18 months later, I felt as if there were decades between us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lila Alligood listens to a detective testify in September 2016. Photograph: Robert Tong/AP\n\nThe defendants\u2019 youth contributed to the media frenzy around the trial, but that was just one of several elements of this case that captured the attention of the Bay Area. There was a senselessness to these crimes that nobody could comprehend, a disruption to the regularly scheduled programming of our prescribed acceptable behavior in society. The fact that the three killed two strangers was especially chilling \u2013 according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s uniform crime reporting program, only about 10% of all homicides nationwide involve strangers \u2013 and the fact that they committed these murders within days of each other led many to wonder whether there had been, or could have been, more had the police not arrested them when they did.\n\nBut most of all, what terrified Bay Area residents was the fact that Haze, Lila, and Sean could have been any one of the hundreds of kids, teens, and young adults we pass on the streets every day. The transient youth population is especially vibrant in California, to the point that they have their own categorization within the realm of homelessness \u2013 street kids. Mention the term \u201cstreet kid\u201d to anyone on the west coast and they will know exactly of whom you speak \u2013 the tough and, at times, confrontational kids with dreadlocked hair who spend all day lounging around in the parks or on the sidewalks. Yes, they\u2019re homeless, but somehow they\u2019re different from the downtrodden folks who line up with carts outside of soup kitchens. They have neither money nor steady employment, but they\u2019re not destitute. They\u2019re not all kids in the sense that they\u2019re under the age of 18, yet they all somehow have both a youthfulness and an aged presence about them.\n\nThese kids were the backbone of the vagabond counterculture that became a part of San Francisco\u2019s identity, but following the slayings of Audrey Carey and Steve Carter, they became scapegoats for law-abiding citizens to fear the most. Complaints that supposedly progressive Bay Area residents had never felt acceptable to voice before spilled over in a frenzied witch-hunt, as they struggled to make peace with the dichotomy of their free-spirited history that accepted and celebrated these wanderers, and their current, unpredictable reality of street kids setting up tents anywhere they pleased, using hard drugs, urinating wherever, and holding loud all-night parties outside people\u2019s homes. At best, these kids blocked sidewalks and lived on handouts. At worst, they were a violent, threatening presence who fought among themselves and scared away customers from local businesses.\n\nFor these Bay Area residents, \u201chere\u201d was the possibility that these kids who had long been part of the fabric of San Francisco life now had the potential to be the monsters, to be the evil that tore through Audrey Carey\u2019s and Steve Carter\u2019s families. \u201cHere\u201d was the chance that you or someone you love could be the next Audrey or Steve.\n\nEven before the killings, street kids were regarded, in San Francisco and beyond, with a level of disdain reserved specifically for this particular subset of the homeless population \u2013 and this disdain has only continued. What little compassion we have for the homeless is saved for those who fit our ideal version of homelessness: those down on their luck, struggling to make their way off the street. On the flip side, there are the street kids. The vagabonds. The drifters. The free spirits, taking advantage of our goodwill to neglect the responsibilities set by a social contract by which we all must abide. A common narrative pushed about these kids is that they are homeless by choice. They could easily not be homeless, so the narrative goes, if they would just get a job. If they would stop being lazy. If only they didn\u2019t want this free-living life.\n\nTo street kids and those who work with them, this narrative is not only inaccurate, but also damaging. Because for the majority of these kids, the choice is between homelessness and, for example, \u201cDo I want to stay at home and get raped every night by my uncle?\u201d, in the words of Christian Garmisa-Calinsky, who ran a non-profit that found housing for street kids in San Francisco. \u201cOr like it was for me: do I want to stay home and get my bones continually broken by my mother?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The public defenders David Brown, left, and Pedro Oliveros, right, representing Morrison Haze Lampley, speak with reporters in October 2015. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP\n\nI had met Christian just days after the three were arrested in Portland, Oregon, at a heated Haight Street community meeting in which he acted as the voice of reason, reminding the angry masses that it\u2019d be unfair to paint all street kids with the same brush and assume all have the potential for murder. After all, just a decade ago, Christian had been part of this population, sleeping in parks with his pack underneath him and his legs tangled over his bicycle to prevent theft.\n\nIn his time on the streets and in the work he does now, he\u2019s come across countless kids with the same sort of background as Haze, Lila, and Sean. They run away to escape a life in which it was beaten into them that they were nothing, less than nothing, and then they are taken in by the streets, where the last of their humanity is ripped from them.\n\n\u201cThis is not offered as an excuse, but as an attempt to understand why we\u2019re all here.\u201d I had been having conversations with Christian about this very point for weeks before David Brown made this statement in court. Christian had needled me for wondering about what forced these kids into the streets, into a life of violence, drug abuse, instability, and \u2013 in the case of Haze, Lila, and Sean \u2013 murder. \u201cYou should focus on the solution, on how to get them off the streets,\u201d he said. Because for those who work with this population, they already know all too well that \u201chere\u201d is what happens when our children are failed, time and time again, by the systems in place. \u201cHere\u201d is the end result of instability, neglect, abuse, drug addiction, mental illness, and violence that is only perpetuated the more time these hurt kids are forced to live as homeless transients, in a community of other hurt kids just as unpredictable and in need of help as they are. \u201cHere\u201d began for generations of youth before Haze, Lila, or Sean were even born.\n\nThis means little to the families of Audrey Carey and Steve Carter. They have had to endure an unspeakable loss because of these circumstances \u2013 circumstances beyond their control \u2013 a loss for which there is no excuse. But these circumstances are not being offered as an excuse. They are being offered as a way to understand this generation of lost youth, a generation of hurt kids just like Haze, Lila, and Sean, many of whom find themselves every day teetering at the same precipice of no return where those three stood in October 2015. \u201cHere\u201d is not Americana folklore, Jack Kerouac, and the Summer of Love coming home to roost. \u201cHere\u201d is a crisis, decades in the making. \u201cHere\u201d is millions of hurt kids, abandoned on the streets, knowing little more than doing whatever it takes to survive.\n\nThe question, now, is where we go from \u201chere\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "description": "In an extract from her book Those Who Wander, Vivian Ho explores the brutal experiences that led to a tragedy", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/998ff7957c363ebada802244ff9b07875dc214ba/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13895978d9896201b03ca0ee25117729", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
