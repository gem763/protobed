Amazon, the second-place runner up, is reportedly weighing its options and may take legal action to challenge the award.\n\nFew imagined Microsoft winning the contract. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is generally considered the industry leader in cloud infrastructure, and was thus considered the frontrunner to win the bid. Google was an early favorite to compete with Amazon, but it dropped out citing employee outrage. Later it admitted it couldn\u2019t get the necessary certifications in time to accept the contract were it to win, a problem that wasn\u2019t unique to Google.\n\nOracle and other companies sued the government, claiming the bidding was unfairly designed to advantage Amazon. The suit claimed that the contract had arbitrary limitations that ruled out almost every other company.\n\nWhen the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and a federal court rejected the lawsuit, it looked like AWS would be the Pentagon\u2019s single-cloud service provider in short order.\n\nAnd then US President Donald Trump got involved.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post. President Trump\u2018s animosity towards the Post, an outlet he\u2019s referred to dozens of times as \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d and a \u201clobbying organization for Amazon\u201d is well-documented.\n\nA couple of months ago reports circulated that Trump was considering forcing the Pentagon to scrap Project JEDI and come up with a different plan \u2013 one that didn\u2019t involve Amazon winning the bid.\n\nGuy Snodgrass, an aide who worked with former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, makes this claim in his soon-to-be-released tell-all \u201cHolding The Line: Inside Trump\u2018s Pentagon with Secretary Mattis.\u201d Per a report from Task & Purpose writer Paul Szoldra, who obtained a pre-release copy, Mattis himself claimed that president Trump told him to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d out of the deal. Snodgrass writes that Mattis refused the order and said he\u2019d run the bidding process ethically.\n\nMattis was subsequently ousted from the administration and, evidently, that paved the way for the Pentagon to turn the JEDI tide in Microsoft\u2018s favor.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely Amazon will cite the president\u2019s personal beef with Bezos in its legal dispute \u2013 it\u2019d have to get in a very long line to accuse the president of yet another conflict of interest. Instead, the smart money says Amazon will make the case that AWS is uniquely suited to support the government\u2019s needs. It probably won\u2019t force the Pentagon to back-track, but the stink surrounding the president\u2019s involvement may be enough to turn the whole fiasco into a political circus. And that could work in Amazon\u2019s favor.\n\nChances are we\u2019ll see Amazon and at least few other companies file suit by the end of the week in hopes of stalling the contract.\n\nWe reached out to Amazon, Microsoft, and the Pentagon for comment but didn\u2019t receive an immediate response.\n\nRead next: DJI's tiny Mavic Mini drone leaks again, and it's adorable", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F10%2FPentagon.jpg&signature=332bf19ea0689ac052ecf9ea5f78e456", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
