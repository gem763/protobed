He pointed to North Korea\u2019s repatriation of American detainees \u201cwho committed hostile acts\u201d against the country and the return of remains of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\n\u201cHowever, the U.S. has done nothing for implementing the joint statement,\u201d the North Korean official said.\n\nOn the contrary, he cited the resumption of U.S.-South Korean military drills \u201cwhich the U.S. president personally pledged to suspend,\u201d and the ratcheting up of U.S. sanctions against the North.\n\nKim Kye-gwan said it is \u201chard reality\u201d that politicians in Washington are obsessed with \u201cnuclear disarmament first\u201d by North Korea before sanctions can be lifted and the country \u201ccan get access to a bright future.\u201d The adviser said this makes him doubt whether \u201ca new breakthrough\u201d could take place in U.S.-North Korean relations through another summit.\n\nBut he left a door open.\n\n\u201cI came to know that President Trump is different from his predecessors in political sense and decision while watching his approach to the DPRK, so I would like to place my hope on President Trump\u2019s wise option and bold decision,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his mid-70s, Kim Kye-gwan is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.\n\nHis statement was issued during the annual meeting of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, where North Korea-U.S. relations, which made headlines last year, have been relegated to the background.\n\nIn his speech to the global gathering on Tuesday, Trump briefly mentioned North Korea, saying the United States has pursued \u201cbold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told Kim Jong-un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realize that promise, North Korea must denuclearize,\u201d the U.S. president said.\n\nLast year, North Korea\u2019s foreign minister represented his nation at the General Assembly meeting. Without any explanation, North Korea downgraded its presence this year from a minister to the \u201cchief of delegation,\u201d usually the country\u2019s ambassador.\n\nThe Pyongyang representative will speak to the 193-member world body on Monday at the General Assembly\u2019s final ministerial session.\n\nNorth Korea entered talks with the United States last year, saying it was willing to negotiate away its advancing nuclear arsenal in exchange for U.S. security guarantee and sanctions relief.\n\nThe North wants a step-by-step disarmament process, in which each of its denuclearization steps is matched by a corresponding U.S. reward. The United States says sanctions on North Korea will remain in place until the country takes significant steps toward denuclearization.\n\nDuring the Singapore summit, Kim Jong Un promised to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula without providing any timetable or roadmap for disarmament steps. In Singapore, Kim and Trump also agreed to establish new bilateral relations and build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThey met again in Vietnam in February for a second summit. But that meeting abruptly fell apart after Trump rejected Kim\u2019s request for extensive relief of sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step. The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June, and agreed to restart talks.\n\nLast week, North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry said working-level nuclear talks with the United States could resume in a few weeks. But it said discussions of North Korea\u2019s denuclearization will only be possible when \u201cthreats and hurdles endangering our system security and obstructing our development are clearly removed beyond all doubt.\u201d\n\n___\n\nEdith M.
