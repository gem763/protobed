But Saudi and US officials have cast doubt on that narrative, stating that evidence suggests that the attack was launched from Iran.\n\nA senior US official told media, including Reuters, that evidence indicated the attack was launched from west-northwest of the facilities, the direction of Iran. The official added that Saudi officials suggested that those responsible may have used cruise missiles to launch the attack.\n\nRead more: The world's largest oil plant in Saudi Arabia was attacked ahead Aramco's plans for the biggest IPO ever\n\n\"There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen,\" Pompeo said in his tweet. He also called on global leaders to \"publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks.\"\n\n\"The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,\" he wrote in a follow-up tweet.\n\nIran says it's prepared for a 'full-fledged war'\n\nMembers of the Iranian revolutionary guard march during a parade to commemorate the anniversary of the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88), in Tehran September 22, 2011. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nTehran has denied allegations that it orchestrated the attack. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Sunday that Pompeo's statements were \"obscure and meaningless\" for diplomatic progress, semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\n\nThe agency also quoted a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander as saying that the country was prepared for a \"full-fledged war.\"\n\n\"Everybody should know that all American bases and their vessels in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) [from Iran borders] are within the range of our missiles,\" General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said on Saturday.\n\nOil prices on Monday skyrocketed to their highest levels in six months, according to Reuters, while US crude futures climbed 15%.\n\nWhite House Adviser Kellyanne Conway did not rule out a meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, but told Fox News Sunday that recent attacks \"did not help\" prospects. She added that the administration was keeping \"many options on the table\" in regards to potential retaliation.\n\n\"This president and his national security team keep many options on the table particularly when it comes to retaliating against malign behavior,\" she said.\n\nTrump on Sunday night tweeted that news suggesting that he would be willing to meet with Iran with \"no conditions\" was \"fake news.\"", "description": "Iran has denied allegations that it was behind the attack and a senior Iranian military official said the country was prepared for a \"full-fledged war.\"", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7edc102e22af06d4426983-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
