Got a question for her? Email askaboss@nymag.com. Photo: The Cut\n\nDear Boss,\n\nI\u2019ve had my current position at a small nonprofit for about nine months. My co-worker Liz and I have the same boss. Neither of us like our boss very much, but our relationships with him are very different. Liz and our boss don\u2019t get along, and most people in the office are aware of it. In my opinion, they are both rather unprofessional in how they handle their dislike of one another. Toward me, however, our boss shows favoritism, which I feel very awkward about. I try to be neutral and strictly professional in my interactions with him. I have a good relationship with Liz, and I\u2019m more casual and friendly toward her than I am with my boss.\n\nThis whole dynamic has resulted in this fairly frequent situation: My boss will confide in me about some work topic that involves Liz\u2019s job \u2014 often, the information we\u2019re discussing involves her more than it involves me. Later, he\u2019ll bring up the subject in a meeting, and it becomes obvious that he hasn\u2019t shared the same background information with Liz (nor does he share it with her during the meeting). Many times Liz picks up on the fact that she hasn\u2019t been told as much as I have and ends up feeling angry and betrayed, which makes the already toxic relationship she has with our boss worse. It also sucks for me because I agree with her that she should have known the information, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s my place to tell her if my boss chose not to share it with her.\n\nMy boss has also complained to me about Liz many times. For example, he once said he hadn\u2019t shared the same information with Liz because she is \u201cextremely emotional.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to play favorites, but I can trust you to handle things more maturely and reasonably.\u201d I usually just ignore it when he complains about her.\n\nIs my boss justified in his decision to share things with me and not with Liz, even when it involves her work? And how should I handle these situations in the future? Do I just have to live with the awkwardness of being the reluctant favorite, or is there a way for me to advocate for more transparency?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that it\u2019s reasonable for your boss to bounce things off you in a way he doesn\u2019t do with Liz. If you\u2019re better at your work, better at talking through ideas, or just generally easier to work with, that often does mean you\u2019ll end up in more conversations with your boss. Managers often want to throw ideas around or even just think something through out loud, and some people are better sounding boards for that than others.\n\nYour boss\u2019s explanation that you handle things more maturely and reasonably than Liz could very well be true. Your assessment that she\u2019s not very professional in handling her dislike of your boss, and the fact that the whole office knows that, supports this. (Of course, since the same thing is true of your boss, he doesn\u2019t sound terribly mature or professional either.)\n\nSo the fact that he\u2019s talking more with you isn\u2019t inherently a problem. But it is a problem if he\u2019s not giving Liz all the background information that she needs to do her job, particularly if it reaches a point where it\u2019s being discussed in a meeting that she\u2019s part of.\n\nIt\u2019s also not cool for your boss to complain to you about Liz. It\u2019s disrespectful to her, and it puts you in an uncomfortable position. Most importantly, though, if he has concerns about Liz\u2019s work, he should be addressing them with her. He\u2019s her manager and he should be actually managing her \u2014 not venting to colleagues about her. By complaining to you instead of addressing and resolving the problem, he\u2019s making himself look weak and like he doesn\u2019t know how to do his job.\n\nYou can\u2019t make your boss manage differently, but there are things you can do on your end. You said you\u2019re worried that it\u2019s not your place to share information with Liz, but when info is relevant to a colleague\u2019s job and it\u2019s not obviously sensitive in some way, it\u2019s very normal to fill them in. It feels awkward to you because of whatever weirdness your boss has going on with her, but that doesn\u2019t need to become your weirdness. You can proceed the way you would if he were treating her normally \u2014 which means being matter-of-fact about saying, \u201cOh, there\u2019s some highly relevant info that will help with your job.\u201d\n\nSo, if he shares info with you that will impact Liz, you can say, \u201cIt sounds like we should loop Liz in on this. Should I go ahead and share this with her?\u201d (Say this in a very matter-of-fact tone, as if of course he\u2019ll want her informed, since it\u2019s weird that he doesn\u2019t.) Or you could just skip asking him and go ahead and loop Liz in, on the assumption that of course she should have information that\u2019s relevant to her job. But there might be some utility in spelling out for him that filling in Liz is a logical and necessary next step.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re in a meeting with both of them where it becomes clear Liz hasn\u2019t been privy to some key piece of information, you can say, \u201cLiz, I\u2019m getting the sense you didn\u2019t know about X. Bob, can we fill her in?\u201d That way you\u2019re politely calling out the oversight and asking to remedy it.\n\nAnd when your boss complains to you about Liz, you can ask him to stop by saying something like, \u201cI feel awkward hearing that kind of thing about a peer!\u201d or \u201cHmmm, I probably shouldn\u2019t be hearing that since she\u2019s my peer.\u201d\n\nIt would also be a kindness to push back on his perception of Liz when you disagree with him. For example, if he complains that she\u2019s very emotional and you haven\u2019t seen any evidence of that, you could say, \u201cHuh, that hasn\u2019t been my experience with her. I\u2019ve always found her to be very reasonable.\u201d Since he seems to respect you, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll be able to affect his thinking. (And if not, he might at least rein in how often he complains to you, which would also be a good outcome.)\n\nUltimately, though, Liz isn\u2019t doing herself any favors by staying in a job where she and her boss openly dislike each other. It\u2019s going to impact the types of projects she\u2019s assigned, the professional development she receives (or more likely, doesn\u2019t receive), future raises, potential advancement, and her reputation. You can try to alleviate her situation with your boss in small ways, but really, the best thing for her would be to get out.\n\nGet Ask a Boss delivered every week Email Terms & Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\nOrder Alison Green\u2019s book Ask a Manager: Clueless Colleagues, Lunch-Stealing Bosses, and the Rest of Your Life at Work here.
