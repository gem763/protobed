I don't know if they are dead or not.\"\n\nMiss Poncova had been desperately trying to help Taylor the day prior to their death, who was having suicidal thoughts following a history of mental health issues.\n\nShe and a friend called 111 just after lunchtime to relay his \"mental anguish\" and Miss Poncova managed to take him to A&E for an emergency consultation.\n\nBut the couple, who were seen holding hands at the hospital, left before speaking to staff and nearly crashed on the way home when a fight broke out in the car.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nMiss Poncova called mental health services via 111 for a second time that evening, from the flat, and was referred to King's College Hospital, but did not manage to leave the apartment.\n\nA text from Miss Poncova to a friend read: \"We didn't get there. He start fighting with me, we nearly crashed.\n\n\"He really scared me, he said he needs time.\n\n\"I can't really push him, he said he'd do something stupid. I hardly got him home, I will try tomorrow.\"\n\nA note written by Taylor was found on the bedroom dressing table, after he took his own life.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nHis daughter said in a witness statement that her dad fell into \"a spiral of depression\" after he lost his job.\n\nThe 14-year-old described \"a special bond\" with her father who she said would often pick her up after work and confide in her.\n\nTaylor, who was born in Barbados, studied in Peckham, south east London, before working as a DJ and later in Burger King and Tesco.\n\nDet Sgt Daniel Catmull said bruises on Miss Poncova's arm suggest her boyfriend lifted her up and pushed her out of the window of the flat on the night of her death.\n\nHe said: \"My conclusion was that Mr Taylor has opened the window; that is because of the prints from him and the position of them.\n\n\"I believe that Mr Taylor has struck the underneath of her arm, freeing that hand therefore unbalancing her and it was then a case of buffeting her legs up to lift her which is why she remains so close to the building striking the window beneath her.\"\n\nThe detective noted there was a balcony in the apartment which would have been a more obvious choice had it been a planned suicide.\n\nHe added: \"If pre-planned, there are much easier places to jump.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\n\"The time leading up to the incident is quite paramount. Mr Taylor's mental decline had accelerated.\"\n\nHer parents, who had bought her a flat and supported her financially, said she did not have any debts and that she quickly received offers after leaving her job weeks before her death.\n\nMiss Poncova was born in Bratislava, Slovakia, where she enjoyed ballet, gymnastics and basketball, which she played competitively as a child.\n\nShe studied physical education before applying to the Faculty of Law with dreams of becoming a lawyer.\n\nWhen she was not accepted onto the course, she moved to London to study languages before reapplying but never returned.\n\nAssistant Southwark Coroner Henrietta Hill QC concluded that Miss Poncova had been unlawfully killed and that Taylor died by suicide.\n\nShe said: \"I feel I have enough evidence to decide who she was, how, when and why she died.\n\n\"I am satisfied so I am sure that she was unlawfully killed.\"\n\nReferring to Taylor, she added: \"He, having pushed Miss Poncova through the window, went through the window himself with suicidal intent.\"", "description": "Tony Taylor, 33, threw Renata Poncova out of the window at their home in Southwark, south London, after he suffered a mental breakdown", "authors": ["Laura Sharman", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Facebook", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549238.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_19515300-7555851-image-a-57_1570660924610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
