It is a way of frankly saying, \u2018Hey, you know we are focused, we are stuck covering the story that we have. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t know there are a whole series of issues of importance in the policy arena that need more attention.'\u201d\n\nThe festival will open on Sunday at the United States Navy Memorial with the US premiere of Toxic Beauty, which explores the unregulated market for beauty products with chemicals and toxins. The movie is the first feature-length documentary to be among the selections.\n\n\u201cWe already regulate the chemicals we ingest in the foods we eat, but we don\u2019t do a good enough job regulating chemicals that we accidentally ingest because we have rubbed it on our face or our elbows or our feet,\u201d Todd said of the project.\n\nThe event also has been timed to be a kickoff for award season, as dozens of titles compete for the Oscar for documentary short. In 2017, three of the entrants ended up as Academy Award nominees.\n\nTodd will moderate panels with filmmakers, along with along with NBC News and MSNBC personalities Andrea Mitchell, Hallie Jackson, Katy Tur, Jacob Soboroff, Morgan Radford and Kristen Welker. The rest of the event, to be held at the Landmark Atlantic Plumbing Cinema in Washington, will split up the documentary shorts into eight themed segments.\n\nAmong the other entries are St. Louis Superman, about Bruce Franks Jr., a rapper and state representative from St. Louis, Mo.; and Water\u2019s Edge, about Louisiana\u2019s efforts to restore its bayous and marshes. Some of the shorts will be posted online for streaming over the next month.\n\nTodd said the festival also is a way for Meet the Press to extend its brand in a different way, perhaps to new audiences that don\u2019t watch the 72-year-old Sunday show, yet will see it as analytical and relevant.\n\n\u201cIn the 21st century, we have to go where consumers and viewers are,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect them to come find you.\u201d He says that he would like to get into producing their own Meet the Press-branded documentaries.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are a few filmmakers that we are talking about, and we go \u2018OK, do we do a co-production, where we have some resources, they have an idea, or visa versa?\u2019 Where we go and find a filmmaker that we know knows this stuff. That is likely how we step into this next,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also thinks that documentary projects have come to resonate more with audiences, particularly millennials, as they have become a staple of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Part of the reason is that issues are presented in a different way than the typical right-left divide. Todd said that they looked for entries that presented issues outside of those partisan lines.\n\n\u201cFilmmakers realize that people are stuck in a left right prism too often, and you almost see that they realize they have to figure out how to break through that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think about this all the time every day on my own show. I know there is a left-right prism or a red-blue prism that people get stuck in, that has become sort of a habit for people in how they think about politics.\u201d", "description": "Meet the Press and the American Film Institute are staging their annual film festival in Washington on Sunday and Monday, a showcase of documentary shorts touching on issues like climate change, education, and immigration.
