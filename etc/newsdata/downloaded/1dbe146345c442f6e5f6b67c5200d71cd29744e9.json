That\u2019s just below the average employment growth of 158,000 jobs year-to-date. Unemployment, meanwhile, is forecast to hold steady at 3.7 percent, near a 50-year-low.\n\nAs the U.S. continues the longest economic expansion on record, investors are looking at the Department of Labor\u2019s monthly payroll and unemployment data for signs that the rapid job growth over the past two years is softening and lending way to an overall growth slowdown.\n\n\u201cFor the moment, the U.S. economy remains fairly strong and job gains continue,\u201d said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cHowever, economic growth, and therefore job creation, are showing clear signs of slowing.\u201d\n\nThe primary reason for the darkening outlook, Birch said, is the 15-month long U.S.-China trade war, which has culminated in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.\n\n\u201cWe expect this slowdown to become increasingly apparent in economic data in the fourth quarter of 2019,\u201d she said.\n\nThe latest economic data suggests the U.S. economy, or at least key parts of it, are already beginning to take a hit from the tariffs.\n\nIn September, the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index fell to 47.8 percent, the lowest level since 2009. Any figure below 50 percent signals a contraction.\n\nThat reading triggered the start of a stock market plunge, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding more than 800 points over the course of two days. It continued on Thursday after the services survey showed the economy is weaker than expected.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report revealed the economy added 135,000 jobs last month, slightly fewer than economists expected, spurring fears the labor market is beginning to cool.\n\n\"Job growth is definitely slowing,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, during a conference call with reporters.\"Businesses have turned more cautious in their hiring. Small businesses have become especially hesitant. If businesses pull back any further, unemployment will begin to rise.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, however, expect the U.S. economy to have added 145,000 jobs last month.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Jobs-report-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
