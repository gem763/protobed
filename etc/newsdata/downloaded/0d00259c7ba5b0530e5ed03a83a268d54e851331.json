Smith on his infamous 2018 NBA Finals mistake: \u2018I laughed about that s--t that night\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "While he said the mistake will stick with him forever, J.R. Smith isn\u2019t taking it too hard. \u201cWe\u2019ve all messed up.\u201d (Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)\n\nIt took nearly 18 months, but J.R. Smith is finally opening up about perhaps the most infamous gaffe in recent NBA Finals history.\n\nSmith, of course, appeared to forget the score of Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals with just seconds left in the fourth quarter, and dribbled out to half court instead of attempting a shot that would have given the Cleveland Cavaliers the win at Oracle Arena. The Cavaliers then fell to the Golden State Warriors 124-114 in overtime.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat moment, more specifically LeBron James\u2019 reaction to it, became a viral meme that seemed to last throughout the entire offseason \u2014 if not longer.\n\nSmith spoke out about the moment on Showtime\u2019s \u201cAll The Smoke\u201d with Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson on Thursday. He said he thought George Hill had already put the Cavaliers in the lead when he missed that final free throw, and he didn\u2019t expect to get the ball when Hill missed, either.\n\nWarning: This video contains language NSFW\n\n\u201cSo I get the ball, nobody called timeout,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo I\u2019m like, \u2018Alright, bet. I\u2019m about to dribble it back out then. Game is about to be over.\u2019 \u201cI look at LeBron, LeBron is pointing like this. I\u2019m like, \u2018What the f--k is he pointing at?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Cavaliers eventually lost the NBA Finals to the Warriors that year, and Smith was waived by the Cavaliers in July. He only played in 11 games in Cleveland last season, too, before publicly requesting a trade after publicly airing his frustrations with the direction the organization was going after James left for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe 34-year-old, who has 15-years in the league with four different teams under his belt, is currently a free agent.\n\nWhile the mistake made waves across the basketball world, then-Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue wasn\u2019t even upset at Smith that night.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s my fault and you want to pin it on me? Alright, cool \u2026 I hit [Lue] that night and I was like, \u2018Bro, I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Bro, what are you talking about? You made a basketball play and it didn\u2019t work out. It happens.\u2019\u201d\n\nLue\u2019s response clearly helped. Smith, though obviously upset at the time, didn\u2019t hold on to the error for long.\n\n\u201cI laughed about that s--t that night \u2026 I\u2019m not a person to hold on to s--t,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hold on to no grudges. I\u2019ll never forget it \u2026 You f--k up. It ain\u2019t the first time. It just so happened that mine was in the Finals. We\u2019ve all messed up.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "While he said the mistake will stick with him forever, J.R.
