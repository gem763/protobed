Foods derived from plants include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes,\" Rebholz said.\n\n\"Animal foods include meat, eggs, dairy, and fish or seafood,\" she said. \"In this study, we did not define plant-based diets on the basis of complete exclusion of animal foods from the diet ... but rather ranked individuals according to their relative frequency of intake of these foods.\"", "description": "Sticking to a plant-based diet or a diet of more plant foods than animal foods could be linked with a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and up to 25% lower risk of early death, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120821084205-healthy-food-tight-budget-grocery-store-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
