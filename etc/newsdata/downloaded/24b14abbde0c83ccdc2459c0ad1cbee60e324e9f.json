But the damage was done, and Mr Carl revealed in an open letter the fallout from the president\u2019s mistake.\n\n\u201cYour drive-by tweet quickly brought a spectrum of intense vitriol and hatred my way. Although I was an accidental casualty caught in the cross-fire of your \u2018lightweight\u2019 tweet, your attack was very purposeful and hurtful,\u201d Mr Carl wrote, in reference to Trump supporters who attacked him online.\n\n\u201cMany others, whether American citizens or global citizens, feel wounded and hurt by the shrapnel and side-effects of your ongoing Twitter attacks.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, I\u2019m sad for you. My first reaction was to laugh out loud at your mistake when I saw your tweet. My second response was sadness and compassion for you.\n\n\u201cOur words overflow from our hearts and can quickly evidence the health or sickness of our souls. Your heart must be in a dangerous place to have such a consistent flow of defamation and disrespect towards so many.\u201d\n\nAccording to an online biography, Mr Carl, lead pastor at the South Fork Baptist Church in Hodgenville, is an Iraq War veteran and father to three daughters.", "description": "A pastor has said Donald Trump caused him to suffer \u201cintense vitriol and hatred\u201d when the US president mistook him on Twitter for a reporter.\u00a0 The incident occurred last week amid an international furore over repeated false claims by Mr Trump that a hurricane would \u201cmost likely\u201d hit Alabama.", "authors": ["Tom Embury-Dennis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
