We can see something of ourselves in them.\n\nTo state the obvious, everyone paying attention here in the States loves the Hong Kongers. Truly. I think we see our best selves in them. And the Hong Kongers waving American flags still see something in us, something that they want to be.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me. But we\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nHave you heard Hong Kong\u2019s new anthem? Perhaps it is a national anthem in the making. Don\u2019t tell some of your more squeamish conservatives, but Hong Kongers \u2014 innovative though they are \u2014 are sticking to the old standbys when trying to rouse fellow feeling; the anthem includes prominent mentions of \u201cblood\u201d and \u201csoil.\u201d Martyrs for freedom tend to make it into anthems.
