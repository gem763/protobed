(Image: Marvel Studios)\n\nPeggy Carter? Meet Ethan Hunt.\n\nWell, ok, probably not, but possible time travel fanfiction I may or may not be working on aside, here\u2019s some fun casting news: Hayley Atwell, known for playing Peggy Carter in the Marvel films and on TV\u2019s Agent Carter, has signed on to join the next Mission: Impossible film.\n\nAs confirmed by the Hollywood Reporter, Atwell will join Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie for the seventh instalment in the spy-action-wild-stunt-excuse franchise, which is currently in production alongside the eighth instalment, also written and directed by McQuarrie.\n\nThe news was first announced via Instagram, where McQuarrie posted a picture of Atwell along with the phrase, \u201cShould you choose to accept\u2026\u201d a reference to the eponymous impossible mission. And Atwell responded, referencing her days as Peggy Carter, \u201cMission: Accepted. Though I\u2019m not the sort to follow orders\u2026\u201d\n\nMaybe, after her stint in Captain America, her own TV show, and now this, we can accept that Hayley Atwell should be a big-name action hero? I\u2019m so ready to live in that world.\n\nThe next Mission: Impossible hits theatres July 23, 2021.\n\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our new Instagram @io9dotcom.", "description": "Peggy Carter?
