And of course this has made importers smile on the one side, and exporters starting to get anxious.\n\nOn the global stage, we saw big news from Moody's and positive developments in the Trade War.\n\nSo let's get into the full review...!\n\nKey Moments (9-13 Sept 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start the week, here was our forecast on Friday the 6th. We saw the market at R14.7706, and the wave count suggested we would see a further drop into the target area of R14.66-14.40 over the coming days.\n\n(How could you have benefitted from having this information at the start of this last week?)\n\nAnd it was a very interesting week that followed, as we saw a calm of sorts finally descend on markets. Here are some of the biggest headlines:\n\nMoody's Update - with all Saffers waiting on tenterhooks for any news on #JunkStatus, Moody's issued an update of sorts ahead of their credit rating decision\n\nTrade War slowdown - finally...finally, it does seem as if there may be a truce somewhere on the horizon somewhere...someday\n\nBrexit - seems to be losing control of the situation more and more each day, as he battles a parliament which is uncertain as to what it wants\n\nEU Stimulus package - an interesting event from ECB's Draghi with a new stimulus package and a change in interest rates\n\nAs for the Rand, it opened a touch below R14.80 on Monday, following worse than expected Non-Farm Payrolls on the Friday. The warning signs for the US economic slowdown were certainly flashing...but the economists could not seem to make up their mind, with differing opinions being offered.\n\nIt was going to be a big week, with a Trade War update only a tweet away...\n\nThe first news of the week on that front was the People\u2019s Bank of China warming up the printing press as they announced another round of quantitative easing.\n\nOver in the UK, the Brexit turmoil continued with Prime Minister Boris Johnson determined to deliver a \u2018deal or no-deal\u2019 Brexit come 31 October...\n\n...however, he does not seem to have the support for this from the UK MP\u2019s, as they rejected then Johnson\u2019s second call for a general election. Despite this, the UK economy appears to be in good shape.\n\nAnd then we were onto the big news of the week: Moody's thoughts on SA's Credit Rating\n\nThe agency's lead analyst for South Africa, Lucie Villa, told a journalist during a press conference at an investment conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday that the country's \"stable outlook provided a low likelihood\" that its credit rating would change.\n\nFor South Africans, this was a moment to just take a deep breath...\n\n...despite all expectations of the downgrade, it appeared that Moody's was going to show some grace, yet again.\n\nHowever, there were some key points identified by Lucie, such as her comments on Eskom: \"Knowing the complexity of the issue, we know first that it will be an iterative process and that it takes time. So our view has been that takes more than a few months to sort out certain issues.\"\n\nOther issues such as SA's slow economic growth were highlighted, but on the whole, a positive piece of news!\n\nAnd the Rand liked this, trading further to touch R14.61 by Wednesday morning:\n\nSouth African Rand\n\nAnd the good news continued, as the Trade War appeared to be slowly simmering down. Trump announced he would be postponing the latest increase in tariffs until the 15th of October, stating that this is a \"gesture of goodwill\".\n\nAnd then on Friday, China finally 'blinked' first, announcing that US Pork and Soybeans, as well as other farm goods, would be excluded from the tariffs. Pork prices in China have been getting out of control, and it is clear that China is now feeling the pinch...\n\n...a very interesting turn of events, and certainly a feather in Trump's cap for sticking it out for this long!\n\nIn other news, there were some big headlines:\n\nIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, SA does have a backstop in place with the UK when it comes to Trade, as the Minister of Trade and Industry confirmed the new trade deal with the UK had been concluded. It will only kick in if Britain leaves the European Union without a trade agreement. However, it does appear the deal is exactly the same as the previous one, with no benefits to the UK or SA - which is unfortunate after all the time put into this.\n\nIn Mario Draghi\u2019s last act as the ECB president, policymakers slashed interest rates by 10 basis points into negative territory, -0.5%. Draghi also announced a new bond-buying stimulus package of 20 billion euros a month (starting 1 November) aimed at reviving the Eurozone economy.\n\nSA\u2019s mining production figures for July came out better than expected at 2.4% y/y, renewing optimism about the mining sector, which has recently been battered by high wage demands, deeper mines and unreliable electricity supplies.\n\nAnd lastly, Trump continued his war on the Fed, saying that the \"The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO\", and in a later Tweet referring to the Fed as \"Boneheads\". This one will certainly be continued when the next US Interest Rate Decision comes around this next week...!\n\nAnd the Rand closed out the week strongly, moving down to touch R14.50 on Friday. It had been quite a week, with a lot of positive and stabilizing news for the markets - and none more so for the Rand than Moody's comments.\n\nAll in all, the market had moved exactly with our prediction from the week before - another success for the Elliott Wave Principle...\n\n...and that was the wrap!\n\nThe Week Ahead (16-20 Sept 2019)\n\nWell, the week has started with the Rand off the lows of last week, and it is certainly going to be a busy week in terms of possible triggers, with local inflation, and US Fed and Bank of England interest rate decisions.\n\n...and that is apart from the Trade War, Brexit and other potential shocks.\n\nSo expect another volatile week, folks!\n\nThe big question : How is this likely to impact the Rand?\n\nAs you can see from last week, we simply let the market itself provide us with the best guess of what was likely to happen - and it followed through perfectly.\n\nHow do we do this?\n\nThrough applying the Elliott Wave Principle (the study of human behaviour in financial markets) together with a unique combination of price ratio, momentum and time cycle studies to provide us with an objective view.\n\nAnd, as you saw in the review above, a forecast like this gives you something that you can use to make objective, informed and actionable decisions. instead of emotionally-charged knew-jerk ones.\n\nBased on our analysis, the next few weeks are likely to take many persons by surprise - please do no be one of them.\n\nLook forward to sharing my outlook with you.\n\nTo your success~\n\nJames Paynter\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Dynamic Outcomes Rand Forecasting Service (James Paynter) covering: USD/ZAR, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
