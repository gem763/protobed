Not the best forecasts going in, but if you \u201cbust\u201d to the pleasant side, it\u2019s better than the other way around, right? We\u2019ve got more beautiful autumn conditions ahead into tomorrow.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Skies should remain partly to mostly clear this evening. The farther east you go, the more clouds you\u2019ll see. This is all connected to the big coastal storm affecting New England. We could get another push of clouds into the area for a bit tonight as well, but it probably won\u2019t last long if so. Lows may dip to the mid-40s in the coolest spots north and west, while making the low 50s or so downtown. Winds are light from the north after sunset.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): It\u2019s looking at lot like today ended up, so if the forecast works out, it\u2019ll be rather nice. Classic fall, more or less. Temperatures are near normal, or in the near-70 to mid-70s zone for highs. Winds are from the north around 5 to 10 mph.\n\nSee Dan Stillman\u2019s forecast through the weekend. And if you haven\u2019t already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Susan Kosisky of the U.S. Army Centralized Allergen Extract Lab delivered some good news as well today, although we are still dealing with mold-spore issues awhile longer. Re-shared below in full:\n\nThe season is winding down as is usual moving into mid-October. We are looking forward to the first frost on the pumpkin to truly end the sporadic weed and grass pollen we see popping up. August through mid-October is when we can see some of our highest mold-spore concentrations with daily average counts reaching upward of 8,000-10,000 or so spores/cubic meter of air. The nights are longer and cooler, and the decaying vegetation and dead leaves also help to facilitate fungi growth and mold spore production. Raking leaves can stir up pollen grains and mold spores that have settled to the ground. Mold spores are common in soil and in the dead and decaying leaves that cover the ground during the fall. In our region, mold spores form a distinct fall season in mid- to late fall, after ragweed season is over. These common airborne allergens can indeed be a problem.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
