The whole mission of rewardStyle is to make influencers as economically successful as possible.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 11: Huda Kattan speaks onstage during Beautycon Festival Los Angeles 2019 at Los Angeles Convention Center on August 11, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

The app connects consumers and retailers with the influencers who peddle your favorite content, who Box says are the digital generation\u2019s salespeople.\n\n\u201cThink of our influencers as a distributed sales network. The same way you would walk into a Nordstrom store and someone might help you find that dress, we\u2019re doing that online for you, and with people you\u2019ve chosen to follow,\u201d explains Box. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s an influencer that you\u2019ve chosen to follow that in your feed, they\u2019re showing a dress \u2014 they\u2019re your salesperson. When they take you to checkout at the online site, we\u2019re actually tracking all of that, giving them the tools to connect you, billing the retailer when you purchase the dress, and then paying the influencer. It\u2019s at no cost to the customer.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nation of niche\u2019 allows micro-influencers to thrive\n\nWhen discussing well-known influencers, names like Kylie and Kendall Jenner or Kim Kardashian may come to mind. They command hundreds of millions of followers across a variety of social media platforms, earning enormous sums of money via sponsored posts and lucrative brand collaborations.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 06: (EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE) Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, and Kendall Jenner attend The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2019 in New York City.

A \u201cnation of niche\u201d has emerged from apps like Instagram, says Box \u2014 that is, the deliberate curation of our social media feeds to reflect our interests.\n\nFor example, with only ten thousand followers, a \u2018micro-influencer\u2019 might seem no match for an account that boast millions. But what a such an influencer lacks in reach, they make up for in trust: their followers are more active and loyal, and therefore, more likely to buy directly from their posts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not household names, but they\u2019re household names to the people who follow them,\u201d Box says of smaller creators. \u201cOur feeds have made it such that we, as a nation of niche, are able to find these people who really speak to us. For influencers, what\u2019s exciting is that there are a lot of people like them, especially new [people] that are coming into the system.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the glut of apps that now make it possible for influencers to connect easily with a broad consumer base, Box is confident that the market for companies such as her own remains wide open.", "description": "Thanks to influencers, the future of digital retail is already here.
