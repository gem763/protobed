Vincenzo Bianconi, who was supported by the two parties that govern on the national level, the Democratic Party (PD) and the 5Star Movement, won just under 35 percent.\n\nAs the scale of the League's victory became apparent, Salvini told reporters: \"We are writing history here tonight.\"\n\nThe result is a major blow to the PD-5Stars government, whose formation two months ago removed the League from power. The Umbria election was the first time the two new allies ever jointly backed a candidate and the first time their tie-up was tested through a vote.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday claimed \"this is not a vote on my government,\" the governing parties' disastrous defeat is certain to have major repercussions for the already-fragile coalition. While Umbria only has 700,000 voters, it has long been one of Italy's left-wing strongholds and had only ever been governed by Communists, the left or the center left.\n\nSalvini will use the League's landslide victory to demonstrate he still has the backing of most Italians despite having pulled the plug on the government over the summer and having been forced into opposition.\n\nThe next big test for the PD-5Stars alliance will come in another regional vote, in Emilia-Romagna, in January.\n\nWhile analysts believe the Umbrian defeat won't bring down the government, losing the region that contains Bologna \u2014 Italy's most symbolic left-wing stronghold \u2014 could destroy the PD-5Stars alliance.", "description": "Election in Umbria delivers major blow to Italy\u2019s governing coalition.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/h_55555986-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
