It\u2019s a gambit that coincides with the next presidential debate Tuesday, when ABC plans to unveil its exclusive interview with the son who will discuss Ukraine, China and Trump\u2019s personal attacks on him.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign \u2014 in keeping with its refusal to discuss the specifics of his son\u2019s business arrangements \u2014 would not comment on the record for this article or discuss the level of coordination between the Democratic candidate and his son.\n\n\u201cHow, when and the substance of this came directly from Hunter,\u201d a campaign adviser, who did not want to be identified, said. \u201cThe campaign did not arrange this, but Hunter has been increasingly under attack in personal and vicious terms for the past couple of weeks from the President \u2014 all based on lies \u2014 and he made the decision to speak.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, which has taken to deriding Biden as \u201cQuid Pro Joe,\u201d mocked Biden\u2019s ethics proposal.\n\n\u201cGovernment reform is laughable coming from someone who spent the last 50 years in government enriching his family in the process,\u201d spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez said, crediting the president with \u201ctrue reform\u201d that \u201chas revitalized the American economy and created over 6.5 million jobs since he was elected.\u201d\n\nTrump has been reeling over the Ukraine scandal since Sept. 20, when news first broke that he may have improperly used U.S. aid as leverage to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens over Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country. Trump now faces impeachment over his own alleged quid pro quo.\n\nIn August, when asked about potential conflicts of interest concerning his brother and son when he was vice president, the candidate said nothing improper happened.\n\n\"I have never discussed, with my son or my brother or with anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses. Period,\" Biden said in South Carolina.\n\nBiden pledged that, as president, \"what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration [when Barack Obama was president]. There will be an absolute wall between personal and private [business interests] and the government ... I\u2019m going to propose the same kind of strict, strict rules. That\u2019s why I never talked with my son or my brother or anyone else \u2014 even distant family \u2014 about their business interests. Period.\u201d\n\nBut Biden went a step further on Sunday when he proposed a blanket ban on family members directly profiting off foreign deals if he\u2019s president, a stricter standard than existed during the Obama presidency in light of Hunter Biden\u2019s arrangements in Ukraine and China.\n\n\"No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country. Period. Period. End of story,\" Biden told reporters in Iowa .\n\nBiden\u2019s new policy also brings him in line with other Democratic candidates who said a president\u2019s family members shouldn\u2019t profit in overseas business dealings.\n\nBiden\u2019s comments also signaled that he may open a new front against President Trump\u2019s children who are involved in overseas business deals \u2014 which an adviser said recently is \u201c not off the table .\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Before his father announced his candidacy, Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney said in his written statement that his client resigned from the natural gas company Burisma in Ukraine at the center of the scandal engulfing Trump.\n\nMesires said Hunter Biden would not work for overseas interests if his dad becomes president.\n\n\u201cHunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests,\u201d Mesires said. \u201cIn any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/ca/080e45c54db4b0f5a4d17d95aa8c/191014-hunter-joe-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
