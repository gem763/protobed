Hasbro hopes so. The company announced the release of Ms Monopoly last week, \u201cthe first-ever game where women make more than men\u201d.\n\nThe game attempts to flip gender inequality on its head: female players collect $240 when they pass go, while men collect only $200. It\u2019s a concept that feels like deliberate catnip for online outrage and think piece writers.\n\n\u201cAt Hasbro, we have always believed in promoting equality and inclusion across our business and our product,\u201d said Kristina Timmins, a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to give the franchise a new mascot: Ms Monopoly, an advocate whose mission is to invest in female entrepreneurs. We want to recognize and celebrate the many contributions women have made to our society and continue to make on a daily basis \u2013 because it\u2019s about time!\u201d\n\nHasbro has taken stabs at girl-centric games before. It first released the cringe Girl Talk in 1988. The game was a quiet, moderate success and special Hannah Montana and One Direction editions were released in the 00s. Girl Talk felt like a company\u2019s idea of what young girls liked. Inspired by Truth or Dare, the game focused exclusively on boys, sleepovers, and talking on the phone. Unlucky players were forced to wear \u201czit-stickers\u201d.\n\nMs Monopoly is part of a larger trend in the children\u2019s toy and board game industry. One where companies are trying their hardest to make playtime more woke.\n\nA new \u201cquarter-life crisis\u201d version of The Game of Life (which promoted the American Dream for decades with its neat path of job, marriage, kids, retirement) now sees players work to pay off $500,000 worth of student debt.\n\nWhen GMT games, a mid-sized publisher that specializes in strategy games, announced its new game, Scramble for Africa, earlier this year the response was outrage. The war game sought to shine light on colonization, as players acted as European powers fighting for control of Africa. But that\u2019s not how the public saw it. The game\u2019s release was quickly cancelled (both in the literal and figurative sense).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barbie, as part of its Inspiring Women doll series, has launched dolls in the image of Amelia Earhart, Frida Kahlo and mathematician Katherine Johnson.

Mattel recently released a Rosa Parks Barbie (as part of its Inspiring Women series) and a D\u00eda de los Muertos version to commemorate the Mexican holiday. They join a growing list of inclusive Barbies and Kens. There\u2019s now a Barbie that uses a wheelchair, a black Barbie with a natural hairstyle, and a Ken with a slightly higher BMI.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Barbie Fashionistas 2019 collection includes dolls in wheelchairs, with new body types, and new hair textures.

Others call them \u201cwoke-washing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Hasbro is serious about women\u2019s empowerment, perhaps the company could start by admitting that a woman invented Monopoly in the first place,\u201d Mary Pilon, author of The Monopolists, wrote in the New Yorker.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s already this vibe in the [board] gaming community that anything Monopoly does is a cash-grab,\u201d says John \u201cHex\u201d Carter, a board game designer and consultant. \u201cBecause the market is already flooded with so many different versions of it. So the motivation behind a game like Ms Monopoly is transparent: to make money.\u201d\n\nCarter praises the educational components of Ms Monopoly. For example, how players land on the various achievements women are behind (Wi-Fi, chocolate chip cookies, shapewear). But he fears the pay disparity aspect will only be frustrating, not educating, to male players. \u201cIn the gaming community, we call something like that a \u2018feel-bad moment\u2019. Where something frustrating happens to you for no reason at all. The more feel-bad moments you have in a game, the less people want to play.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy question is how will Hasbro go beyond this name change and special edition,\u201d says Nadya Okamoto, a consultant at JUL Consulting. At only 21, Nadya focuses on advising major companies on how to best market to Gen-Z audiences. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this with other companies, like when iHOP changed its name to iHOB in search of a viral moment. This feels similar to that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Monopoly for Millennials Photograph: Hasbro\n\nHasbro has been in search of creating a conversation with its Monopoly brand. The game has already been reimagined over 2,500 times (from Bond to Wizard of Oz special editions). In the last year, the company has come up with two controversial editions of its cash cow. Monopoly: Socialism, Winning is for Capitalists sees players draw cards that poke fun at organic waste, dairy-free beverages, and minimum wage increases. Every player is given a $50 \u201cliving wage\u201d. While Monopoly: Millennials sells itself with the tagline, \u201cForget real estate. You can\u2019t afford it anyway.\u201d Of course, dozens of outraged, reactionary pieces were written in response to the two games. It\u2019s easy to suspect that was always Hasbro\u2019s goal.\n\nCarter says board game designers are increasingly having conversations about their responsibilities to be both politically correct and inclusive. He points to games that have drawn criticism for including slavery in their gameplay. \u201cThere\u2019s now sensitivity players in the industry, to help make sure designers are respecting different cultures,\u201d he says.\n\nHasbro says Ms Monopoly is different. When pressed on appearing to use feminist values for profit, Timmins pointed to several initiatives at the company \u2013 from improving conditions for female factory workers to expanding parental leave policies \u2013 as a sign that the company is committed to gender equality.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mattel\u2019s D\u00eda de los Muertos Barbie is sold out everywhere. Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTimmins declined to reveal if Hasbro has any more progressive versions of its classics in the works. For example, what if a new Operation commented on the lack of access to healthcare plaguing Americans? Or if a new version of Guess Who tackled implicit bias?\n\nRegardless, Hasbro will soon find out if its conversation-starting release has paid off. Mattel has. The D\u00eda de Los Muertos Barbie is sold out everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hasbro\u2019s new Ms Monopoly, where women will make more than men, and Barbie\u2019s inclusive line strive for empowerment, but is it just for profit?", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/09/16/atrocities,-i-don't-support.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b728fc519efed63144c3a7f586a971c", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
