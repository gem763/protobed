(Max Rossi/Reuters)\n\nThe proposed Amazonian exception for married Catholic priests is really a \u2018progressive\u2019 ploy.\n\n\u201cBesides, the Party was in the right. It must be so; how could the immortal, collective brain be mistaken? By what external standard could you check its judgements?\u201d\n\n\u2014 George Orwell, 1984, Part III, Section IV\n\nFor the French Communist Alain Badiou, philosophy is merely an elaboration of some great \u201cEvent\u201d to which the philosopher is faithful. Badiou\u2019s event was the Cultural Revolution, and the one intellectual on the world stage was Mao Zedong, who Badiou claims \u201cthinks in an almost infinite way.\u201d One can get a flavor of the quality of Badiou\u2019s elaboration of Mao in less than a paragraph of text. Here goes:\n\nWe are familiar with Mao Zedong\u2019s formula: \u201cMarxism comprises many principles, but in the final analysis they can all be brought back to a single sentence: It is right to rebel against the reactionaries.\u201d This phrase, which appears so simple, is at the same time rather mysterious: How is it conceivable that Marx\u2019s enormous theoretical enterprise, with its ceaselessly and scrupulously reworked and recast analyses, can be concentrated in a single maxim: \u201cIt is right to rebel against the reactionaries\u201d?\n\nAll the verbal curlicues of Badiou\u2019s modern French Marxism are really just a mysterious benediction over any word or deed that works revolution. That is why George Orwell\u2019s description of how the Party works in his fictional 1984 is so arresting. Like Mao\u2019s infinities, the Party requires the belief in contradictions. \u201cIt was not easy,\u201d Winston says, of quieting the mind.\n\nIt needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as \u201ctwo and two make five\u201d were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.\n\nJohn Henry Newman was canonized a saint a few weeks ago by the Catholic Church. His essay on the development of doctrine laid out stringent criteria by which to judge new expressions by Churchmen. Chief among them, they must not violate the law of non-contradiction. \u201cA true development is that which is conservative of its original, and a corruption is that which tends to its destruction,\u201d he wrote. What would he think today?\n\nI often think of Badiou and Mao, and Orwell\u2019s Winston Smith, when I read documents authored by the au courant prelates of my Catholic Church, or apologetics on behalf of the new way of doing things. In 2018, a Canadian priest and Catholic media maven, Fr. Thomas Rosica, wrote that Pope Francis \u201cbreaks Catholic traditions whenever he wants because he is \u2018free from disordered attachments.\u2019\u201d One hears in this the same line about thinking in infinities. It turned out that Fr. Thomas Rosica had plagiarized this effulgent passage from an ex-Catholic turned fundamentalist, and reversed its meaning by doing so. The original author had meant it as a criticism, the latter as flattery. The latter\u2019s use required stupidity and intelligence. On his grave, it should say, He loved Big Jesuit.\n\nThe recently concluded Synod of the Amazon has been dogged by the principle of contradiction. A scandal broke out about a statuette of a pregnant figure. Some authorities in Rome called it an image of the Blessed Virgin \u2014 a veritable Our Lady of the Amazon. Others, including Pope Francis himself, called the statue \u201cPachama\u201d after the South American fertility goddess. Some activist Catholics, having been told this was an idol of a false god being erected in their Churches, took the statue and threw it into the Tiber. But Francis clarified that the display of the statues was \u201cwithout blasphemous intent.\u201d There\u2019s a certain athleticism of mind at work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Synod\u2019s concluding document suggested reopening the question of admitting women to the ordained diaconate and admitting to the priesthood qualified Amazonian men who are married.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn editorial in The Tablet champions the Synod and tries to outline a further reforming spirit issuing from it. The editorial writer says that the Second Vatican Council did not accomplish its work chiefly through the documents it issued, but \u201cthrough the event of bringing bishops across the world into one place, and the spirit of renewal it sought to unleash. The moment was as important as the message.\u201d [Emphasis mine.] It used to be \u201cthe spirit of Vatican II,\u201d but in recent texts this is changed to \u201cthe event.\u201d\n\nThe editorial quotes the late Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, that lion of the progressives: \u201cThe church is tired in the Europe of well-being and in America. . . . Our culture has become old, our churches and our religious houses are big and empty, the bureaucratic apparatus of the church grows, our rites and our dress are pompous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut of course, there was nothing \u2014 nothing at all \u2014 novel or surprising discussed at the Synod, and very little that was particularly Amazonian. It was all the half-century-old preoccupations of liberal European and American clerics: married priests, women in ordained offices, and non-traditional liturgy. The Synod documents, save for some flourishes about ecology, could have been ripped from any 1970s issue of Concilium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Amazonian Synod itself was a brainchild of an old European, Bishop Kr\u00e4utler, an advocate of women\u2019s ordination to the priesthood. Though the step toward ordaining married men as priests in the Amazon is justified to the world as meeting the specific needs of one region, in fact Kr\u00e4utler says it \u201ccan be the cause of an epochal step in the Universal Church.\u201d This is of course how revolutions work: Allow an exception in one theoretical case, and then watch as the implementation of this exception obliterates the principle in fact.\n\nAll the bilious rhetoric about \u201crigidity\u201d in the Church, all the modern ecclesiastical logorrhea about dialogue, and the burble about \u201cthe liturgical, theological, disciplinary and spiritual patrimony of the Amazon\u201d can be distilled back down to the same iconoclastic impulse: The only rule is to revolt against the reactionaries.", "description": "The proposal to allow Catholic priests in the Amazon to be married is part of a broader movement to overturn centuries of Catholic teaching.", "authors": ["Michael Brendan Dougherty", "Andrew C.
