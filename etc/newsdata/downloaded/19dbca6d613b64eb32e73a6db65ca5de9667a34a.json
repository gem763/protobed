We don't differentiate, and consider ourselves Arabs just as much as we are Kurds.\"\n\nAnkara views the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and has long made it clear it wants to rid the border area of \"terrorist elements\".\n\n191012194021131\n\nThe PKK has waged a decades-long armed campaign against Turkey, aiming to form an independent state, and is considered a \"terrorist group\" by Ankara and many Western countries.\n\nThe YPG has been accused of various rights abuses for years, one of the most alarming was recruiting children to become combatants.\n\nIn August last year, US-based Human Rights Watch said the YPG was recruiting child soldiers to train in military camps within areas under its control.\n\n\"It's especially horrendous that the group is recruiting children from the vulnerable families in displacement camps without their parents' knowledge or even telling them where their children are,\" HRW acting emergencies director Priyanka Motaparthy, said at the time.\n\nThat has been one of the main reasons Umm Laund never thought of returning.\n\n\"They [the YPG] took our friends' and neighbours' children to fight \u2026 They would go door-to-door, speaking to young girls and boys, summoning them \u2026 luring them in,\" she said.\n\n\"Our children are far too dear, we simply couldn't let that happen.\"\n\nFor Umm Laund, fears for the safety of her children, nieces and nephews prevent her from returning home [Hosam Salem/Al Jazeera]\n\nAbu Mohammed al-Kurdi, Umm Laund's brother, agreed.\n\n\"We don't like to be politicised, especially because we don't endorse or agree with the YPG's policies,\" the 46-year-old said.\n\nThe father of six does not have Syrian citizenship.\n\nHis family's ancestors were among thousands of Kurds who were considered \"foreigners\" for coming into Syria from neighbouring Turkey in the 1900s, following the fall of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAs a result, he was unable to access higher education, find a job in the public sector, or register his marriage with the Syrian government.\n\n\"We saw people become doctors, lawyers, professors \u2026 but we still loved our country,\" Abu Mohammed, who described his family as one with \"musical and cultural\" interests, said.\n\nSyrian identification papers are given to those denied citizenship , like Abu Mohammed's family [Hosam Salem/Al Jazeera]\n\nAlong with his eldest son, who is now 15 years old, Abu Mohammed makes a living by playing at local events on his prized electric organ.\n\n\"I condemn all forms of violence \u2026 All I ever wanted was to live in peace with my wife and children,\" he said.\n\n\"Our intent is to bring people together through music and help them see beyond the differences this war imposed on us.\"\n\n'Reclaim Raqqa'\n\nNow home to about 4.5 million people, the northeastern Syrian region is predominantly inhabited by Arabs, with Kurds accounting for more than an estimated 10 percent of its population.\n\nBoth ethnicities, along with minority Turkmen and Circassian groups, have coexisted for decades and have married into each other's tribes and families.\n\nIbrahim Jaddou, a 50-year-old Kurdish history teacher from Raqqa, married his ethnically Arab wife more than 15 years ago,\n\nAlong with their two children, they fled Raqqa in 2012, running from government air attacks on the area.\n\nThe teacher-turned-activist still remembers hearing the sounds of bombs fall not too far from his home. He also remembers the gruesome images of the shelling's aftermath.\n\nIbrahim Jaddou remembers bombs falling near his old home in Raqqa during air attacks in 2012 [Hosam Salem/Al Jazeera]\n\n\"Seeing it is different from hearing about it,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"I had to do something to help. I cleaned up areas where I had to move body parts with my own hands,\" he said.\n\nBefore ISIL gained full control of Raqqa, which it proclaimed as the capital of its so-called caliphate in 2014, Jaddou said life had already become \"unbearable\".\n\nAsked why he never returned after ISIL was overthrown, Jaddou said he refused to return to another form of oppression.\n\n\"The YPG's policies are strictly sectarian,\" he noted, echoing Umm Laund's sentiment. \"They just want to create a country for the Kurds, but what we really want is a system overhaul.\"\n\n\"I would only support a joint democratic system, one that is inclusive of all our country's ethnicities and religions,\" he continued.\n\nThe ongoing operation has given him hope that Raqqa might once again fall into the hands of Turkish-backed opposition, which he supports as an alternative to the government's rule.\n\n\"I would love to see Erdogan help us reclaim Raqqa,\" he said.", "description": "Fearing sectarianism and the YPG, some Syrian Kurds are choosing to remain in Turkey.", "authors": ["Farah Najjar"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/906246100a794980a02ed93cd362c45b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
