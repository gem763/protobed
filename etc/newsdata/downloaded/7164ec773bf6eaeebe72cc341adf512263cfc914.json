Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Trump was requesting foreign help to interfere in the 2020 election, and that he was temporarily withholding U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage \u2014 accusations that the president denies vehemently.\n\nAs Democrats moved to fast-track their impeachment inquiry, the chairmen of three House committees on Monday subpoenaed the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, demanding documents related to the Ukraine probe.\n\n\u201cA growing public record indicates that the president, his agent Rudy Giuliani and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically motivated investigations,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\nThey said Mr. Giuliani urged Ukraine to prosecute citizens who provided evidence against Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and to investigate Mr. Biden. They asked Mr. Giuliani to turn over all phone records and text messages by Oct. 15.\n\nMr. Giuliani said the subpoenas were \u201csigned only by Democrat chairs who have prejudged this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt raises significant issues concerning legitimacy and constitutional and legal issues including \u2026 attorney-client and other privileges,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt will be given appropriate consideration.\u201d\n\nThe president increasingly has targeted the whistleblower who filed the complaint against him in August, accusing the person of relying on second-hand information from other government employees, some of whom apparently listened in on Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call as standard practice. Mr. Trump said on Twitter the complaint \u201cis not holding up\u201d and that he has a right to \u201cmeet my accuser\u201d in public.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSafety concerns\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee called on Chairman Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, to protect witnesses from intimidation and investigate whether Trump officials initially tried to conceal the president\u2019s phone call and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cThis committee should not sit idly by as the president threatens potential witnesses, whose testimony may be crucial to congressional investigations into credible allegations against him,\u201d the Democrats wrote in a letter.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called on Republicans to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s public criticisms of the whistleblower, saying they pose a safety concern.\n\n\u201cMy hope would be that even my Republican colleagues who may not want to weigh in on the substance of the complaint need to stand up and push back on this president\u2019s outrageous behavior,\u201d Mr. Warner told CNN.\n\nLittle can be done to protect the whistleblower\u2019s safety, experts say.\n\n\u201cWhistleblowing is inherently treacherous. We can do our best to minimize the threats, but whenever we get into high-stakes political battles all we can do is cross our fingers and hope for the best,\u201d said Tom Devine, legal director at the Government Accountability Project who has assisted more than 7,000 whistleblowers over the past 40 years.\n\nRaneta J. Mack, an expert on witness security who teaches law at Creighton University, said the whistleblower could be hidden in a safe house ahead of his testimony and may possibly enter the FBI\u2019s witness protection program later.\n\n\u201cIf the threats continue, that\u2019s when changing identities becomes a real possibility,\u201d she said.\n\nLast year, the Senate Intelligence Committee staffer responsible for securing witness and document confidentiality pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with journalists. That staffer, James Wolfe, was never charged with leaking documents, but he admitted misleading authorities about his romantic relationship with a journalist and was sentenced to two months in prison.\n\nTwo men who have appeared before the committee\u2019s Russia investigation, former Trump campaign official Carter Page and lobbyist W. Samuel Patten, said Mr. Wolfe leaked documents related to their testimony.\n\nThe president insists that the whistleblower in his case is wrong, saying repeatedly that his call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he didn\u2019t pressure the new Ukrainian leader with a threat to withhold critical America military aid.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been tremendous corruption [by Democrats], and we\u2019re seeking it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut the whistleblower reported a totally different statement. When the whistleblower reported it, he made it sound terrible.\u201d\n\nMultiple news outlets reported Monday evening that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the call.\n\nMr. Trump also asserted that someone in government \u201cchanged the long-standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report\u201d to allow for complaints based on second-hand information.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and two other top Republicans on Monday asked the intelligence community inspector general whether his office changed the official whistleblower complaint form to enable the allegations filed against the president.\n\nMr. Zaid countered that the charge was false \u2014 \u201cThere has never been any requirement that #whistleblowers were required to possess first-hand knowledge to file complaint. No law anywhere states that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe inspector general is authorized to investigate a complaint based on second-hand information to corroborate it, which is what happened, according to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nThe president also pointed out that Mr. Zelensky said at the United Nations last week that he had not felt pressured in their phone call.\n\n\u201cCase closed!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have been pushing for information from Ukraine about Hunter Biden, the vice president\u2019s son, who had no experience in the energy industry but received $3 million for a post with a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father served as vice president and as a key U.S. liaison to Ukraine.\n\nThe elder Mr. Biden threatened in 2016 to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine fired its top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating the gas company. Mr. Biden said the prosecutor wasn\u2019t pursuing corruption aggressively.\n\nThe president said he will keep pushing to uncover evidence of Democrats\u2019 corruption related to the origins of the Russia investigation by the FBI \u2014 unfounded allegations that Moscow conspired with the Trump campaign to meddle in the 2016 election. Some of those allegations are believed to have originated in Ukraine, an issue he raised in his call with Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election against us,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd we want to get to the bottom of it, and it\u2019s very important that we do.\u201d\n\nAustralian connection\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that Mr. Trump also sought the help of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a recent phone call to help Attorney General William P. Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, citing two U.S. officials with knowledge of the call.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign, called \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d began in 2016 after Australian officials told the agency that Russian operatives offered the Trump campaign damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The resulting investigation that ran nearly three years and cost tens of millions of dollars found no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa on Monday asked the Justice Department to investigate claims that Democrats worked with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Barr, the lawmakers asked for more information about whether Ukrainian officials sought to undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. They also want to know more about Mr. Biden\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian officials.\n\n\u201cUkrainian efforts abetted by a U.S. political party to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cSuch allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempted to undermine our democratic processes.\u201d\n\nThe letter comes just days after the Justice Department revealed U.S. Attorney John Durham is investigating whether Ukraine was involved in any efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. Mr. Durham was handpicked by the attorney general to look into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nIn the letter, the senators say Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic consultant, coordinated with Ukrainian officials to find opposition research on Mr. Trump in 2016. Ms. Chalupa is Ukrainian-American and worked as a Democratic consultant for more than a decade. She has denied reports that she sought to find damaging information on Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Zelensky said Monday that Kyiv is \u201copen\u201d to investigating Mr. Biden and his son, but won\u2019t act solely at the request of the United States.\n\n\u201cOur independent law enforcement agencies are ready to investigate any case in which the law has been broken,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said, according to Reuters. \u201cWe can\u2019t be commanded to do anything. We are an independent country,\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky also said it\u2019s unlikely his government would release its transcript of the phone call with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are certain nuances and things which I think it would be incorrect, even, to publish,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump intensified his criticism of Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, suggesting he be arrested for treason for reading aloud a made-up summary of the president\u2019s phone call at a committee hearing last week.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff made up a phony call, and he read it to the Congress, and he read it to the people of the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cThis whole thing is a disgrace. It\u2019s called \u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
