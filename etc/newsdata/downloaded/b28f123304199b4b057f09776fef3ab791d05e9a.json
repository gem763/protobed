All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nHere are some examples from as far back as 1998 up to recent times when lynching was used to describe what Democrats thought was a partisan political attack:\n\n\u2022 An article published in the New York Times on December 19, 1998 during the impeachment of Bill Clinton:\n\nLater, Representative Ike Skelton, Democrat of Missouri, said the Republicans wanted to \u201cdecapitate their Commander in Chief.\u201d Representative Steven R. Rothman, a New Jersey Democrat, complained of a \u201cRepublican juggernaut, driven by the right wing.\u201d Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, a nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, spoke of \u201ca political lynching,\u201d and Representative Danny K. Davis, an Illinois Democrat, denounced what he described as \u201ca lynching.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Brianna Keilar interviewed Never Trumper and former congressman from Connecticut Chris Shays on Aug. 11, 2016, on CNN:\n\nBrianna Keilar: Another Republican breaking with his party to support Hillary Clinton. We\u2019re talking about former congressman Chris Shays, who wrote on Op-Ed for cnn.com about his decision, saying in part, \u201cI know some Republicans dislike President Obama and have such a strong dislike for Hillary Clinton. They are willing to vote for a man they know does not have the temperament, knowledge, or experience to be president. In fact, I think many Republicans know Donald Trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large and still plan to vote for him. But not me.\u201d Former Connecticut congressman Chris Shays joining us now. And tell us about your decision. How did you come to this conclusion that you were not going to \u2014 not only are you not going to support Donald Trump, but you are going to support Hillary Clinton. Shays: Well, first off, I was a strong and am a strong supporter of John Kasich. He was my first choice, my second choice, my third choice, but now my conclusion is that Hillary Clinton is my choice. If you had told me I would have said that three months ago, I would have been really surprised. So I watched the conventions. Republicans had a very dark convention. It was almost like a lynching, you know \u2014 guilty and lock her up. And I thought this isn\u2019t the party of Ronald Reagan and it ain\u2019t the party that I joined. https://twitter.com/CNNOpinion/status/657658275958255617?s=20\n\n\u2022 MSNBC interviewed Hillary Clinton on March 14, 2016:\n\nHillary Clinton said Donald Trump is \u201cinciting mob violence\u201d that recalls lynch mobs Monday evening at an MSNBC townhall, where she also took tough questions on foreign policy and trade. Clinton told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, who moderated the event in Springfield, Illinois, that she holds Trump responsible for the violence seen in recent days at his rallies, and believes his rhetoric is not only wrong and offensive, but also \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been building this incitement,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are inciting mob violence, which is what Trump is doing,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of memories that people have. They\u2019re in the DNA. People remember mob violence that lead to lynching, people remember mob violence that lead to people being shot, being grabbed, being mistreated. And it\u2019s something that has a deep, almost psychological resonance to people who have ever been in any position of feeling somewhat fearful, somewhat worried.\u201d https://twitter.com/SteveGuest/status/1186714766896717831\n\n\u2022 Dan Rodricks wrote a commentary about Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment on December 16, 1998, in the Baltimore Sun:\n\nSo Clinton stepped into a trap set by those who\u2019ve been out to get him. And, knowing this \u2013 because he\u2019s a Rhodes scholar, after all \u2013 he still didn\u2019t tell the whole truth. He gave his enemies the hanging rope. (I think he should have told Jones\u2019 lawyers, and later Starr, that the question of his relationships with women-not-his-wife was none of their business. Or he should have told the truth.) So here we are, my fellow Americans. Clinton lied under oath, and that warrants impeachment. Right? Some say no. A lie stemming from a private matter doesn\u2019t matter. A lie in such a situation is understandable; most any man or woman would have done the same. Impeachment for such a minor offense would hurt the country more than Clinton\u2019s lies ever did. Besides, this whole thing looks like a political lynching, an attempt to overturn two elections.\n\n\u2022 The Washington Post published this on October 31, 2016, about former FBI director James Comey:\n\nTrump\u2019s entire campaign boiled down to one argument, summed up in his ever-elegant designation of his opponent as \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d That was all he had. At his political rallies, even at the Republican National Convention, he encouraged his devoted throng to shout \u201cLock her up!\u201d While many Republicans no doubt believed she had to be guilty of something (with the same confidence that many Democrats believed George W. Bush lied the nation into war in Iraq), they also needed her to be found guilty. With a sure loser as their nominee, it was their only hope. Republicans had become a lynch mob, demanding frontier justice, and they howled in outrage when Comey refused to participate in the hanging, accusing him of unfairly rigging the election when all he had done was his job.\n\n\u2022 CBS wrote about the \u201cGOP Lynch mob\u201d on April 6, 2011:\n\nGOP lynch mob is still trying to string up the fledgling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Members of the House Financial Services Committee met today to discuss four bills, all sponsored by Republicans and backed by the banking industry, aimed at subduing the agency even before it officially launches this summer.\n\n\u2022 The New York Times wrote about Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment on September 18, 1998:\n\nA \u201dlarge volume of calls\u201d to Senator John Glenn, a Democrat who said this week that it would be \u201dreckless and injudicious\u201d for him to join \u201dthe rush to judgment\u201d in the Lewinsky matter, have run 2 to 1 in favor of resignation or impeachment. Mr. Chabot\u2019s office said the tally there was 425 to 15 against Mr. Clinton since Kenneth W. Starr issued his report a week ago. Not that the President lacks vocal supporters in this state. The Ohio Democratic chairman, David J. Leland, said, \u201dThe vast majority of Ohio Democrats want to see this President continue in office, because they know a political lynching when they see one.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Baltimore Sun wrote about Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment on September 12, 1998:\n\n\u201cThis feels today like we\u2019re taking a step down the road to becoming a political lynch mob,\u201d fumed Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington state. \u201cFind the rope, find the tree and ask a bunch of questions later.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Columnist Mark Shields wrote about then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on November 2, 2004:\n\nFour years later, Speaker Gingrich led a \u2018family values\u2019 House Republican lynch mob bent on stringing up and impeaching the faithless and lying husband who was the president of the United States and a Democrat.\n\n\u2022 Columnist Rosa Brooks wrote about the Breitbart lynch mob on Foreign Policy\u2018s website on February 7, 2017:\n\nHere\u2019s how lynch mobs form, in the age of the alt-right and \u201calternative facts.\u201d First, you inadvertently wave a red flag at an arena full of bulls. Then you sit back and wait for the internet to do its dark magic.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "A quick online search reveals the irony of the Democrats and Never Trumpers' outrage after President Trump tweeted the word \"lynching.\"", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-51656095-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
