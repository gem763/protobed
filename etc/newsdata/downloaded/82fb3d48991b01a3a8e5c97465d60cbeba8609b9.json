They try to understand why Washington opposes the creation of a safe haven for refugees in northern Syria.\"", "description": "Turkey dismissed global opposition to its military operation in Syria on Tuesday and slammed a \"dirty deal\" between President Bashar al-Assad's regime and Kurdish forces as US troops began their withdrawal from the battle zone.
