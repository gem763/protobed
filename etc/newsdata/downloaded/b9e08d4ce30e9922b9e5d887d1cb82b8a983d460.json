While Russia views the cosmodrome as a national security priority, with its current Soviet-era launch base located at Baikonur in neighboring Kazakhstan, the $3 billion project has been plagued by controversy.\n\nRogozin, who\u2019s frequently highlighted the threat posed by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX venture to Russia\u2019s launch industry, quickly took to Twitter to defend himself. \u201cIt\u2019s always been this way: some build, while others criticize,\u201d Rogozin wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the business.\u201d\n\nSplits within the Kremlin elite have become more visible since Putin\u2019s re-election last year to what may be his final presidential term under Russia\u2019s constitution, amid jostling by rival factions. Last month, for example, Rostec State Corp. chief Sergey Chemezov, a longtime Putin ally and fellow spy, contradicted the official line that recent Moscow election protests should be put down forcefully, warning instead that the country risked stagnation without a healthy opposition.\n\nPutin ordered Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee to examine construction at Vostochny during a visit to the space center after a planned first rocket launch was delayed in 2015. Months earlier, workers who hadn\u2019t been paid for months went on hunger strike and appealed to Putin for help by painting a message on the roof of their barracks.\n\nThe Prosecutor General\u2019s Office has opened a series of criminal cases after uncovering 10 billion rubles ($150 million) in losses during construction at Vostochny. In one sparkling example of corruption, a contractor accused of stealing 4 million rubles was detained in Minsk, Belarus, while driving a Mercedes covered in Swarovski crystals.\n\nWhile the space center went into operation in 2016, officials uncovered a critical defect on one of Vostochny\u2019s launchpads as recently as last November, RBC news website reported. In 2017, a satellite launch failed after the rocket was programmed with coordinates for takeoff from another launch pad.\n\nAlexei Kudrin, the head of Russia\u2019s Audit Chamber, told lawmakers last year that he had found 760 billion rubles ($11.4 billion) of financial violations in Roscosmos\u2019s books, including several billion that had been \u201cbasically stolen,\u201d describing the space agency as \u201cthe champion in terms of the scale of such violations.\u201d Roscosmos said the criticism related to a 2017 audit, before Rogozin\u2019s appointment.\n\nRogozin, who was responsible as deputy premier for the space industry, threatened in 2015 to \u201crip off the heads\u201d of construction staff involved in corruption after Vostochny risked having its electricity cut off over unpaid bills, according to the Interfax news service.\n\n--With assistance from Ilya Arkhipov and Stepan Kravchenko.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jake Rudnitsky in Moscow at jrudnitsky@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Torrey Clark at tclark8@bloomberg.net, Tony Halpin, Paul Abelsky\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A series of corruption scandals, cost overruns and mishaps at Russia\u2019s new Vostochny Cosmodrome have brought long-simmering questions about the leadership of the country\u2019s space agency into public view.\u201cThe situation is unacceptable for everyone, including the construction of the first", "authors": ["Jake Rudnitsky"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"}
