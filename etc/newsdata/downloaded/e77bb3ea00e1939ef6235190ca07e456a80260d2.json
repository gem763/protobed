It offers an opportunity for voters to judge these candidates and to take a fresh look at those seeking to boost their candidacy with a memorable debate message.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday found the field is currently stratified into three groups. First comes a leading trio of former vice president Joe Biden who is backed by 29 percent of Democratic-leaning registered voters nationwide, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 19 percent and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at 18 percent. They\u2019re followed by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) at 7 percent and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent. Rounding out the stage are former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Yang, each at 3 percent, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) at 2 percent and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro at 1 percent.\n\nBiden\u2019s advantage has been fairly stable in national polling so far. The Post-ABC poll finds Biden is well-liked among Democrats and has made defeating President Trump a focus of his campaign.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll found a 45 percent plurality of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying that they thought he had the best chance to do that. Sanders and Warren were far behind on this question, with 14 percent and 12 percent, respectively saying each candidate is the best-equipped to defeat Trump.\n\nThe same poll found almost 8 in 10 Democratic leaners with favorable ratings of Biden. Sanders and Warren enjoy similar levels of favorability among Democrats.\n\nBut the former vice president is weaker on another question. When asked who would make the best president \u2014 regardless of who can best defeat Trump \u2014 Biden\u2019s lead shrinks. Some 24 percent of Democratic-leaning voters say Biden would make the best president, slightly edging out Warren (20 percent) and Sanders (16 percent).\n\nOther candidates are likely to challenge Biden\u2019s reputation as most electable. The Post-ABC poll found 51 percent of Democratic voters saying it\u2019s more important for the party to nominate the candidate who is most likely to defeat Trump than the candidate who is closest to them on the issues. Biden currently has a large lead among voters who prioritize electability over issue positions.\n\nDemocrats express some concern that older candidates may not fare as well against Trump in a general election, something that could impact judgments of all three top-polling candidates; Sanders is 78, Biden is 76 and Warren is 70. Trump is 73. Most Democratic-leaning adults, 58 percent, say it doesn\u2019t matter whether their nominee is older or younger than 70, but 40 percent say a younger candidate would be more likely to defeat Trump. Just 3 percent say someone who is over 70 years old would be more likely to beat the president.\n\nThe seven other candidates in the debate could all benefit from becoming better known to Democrats across the country, many of whom are unfamiliar with them. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll released Thursday found more than a quarter of Democratic-leaning adults had neither a favorable nor an unfavorable impression of Harris, more than 3 in 10 were unfamiliar with O\u2019Rourke, Booker and Buttigieg, and more than 4 in 10 were unsure about Castro, Yang and Klobuchar.\n\nEach has a reason for some optimism: Democrats who are aware of each candidate have largely positive impressions. But they will need to make a significantly different impression on voters than they have so far in order to close the gap between them and the top trio of candidates.", "description": "Thursday\u2019s debate is the first this year in which all the top-polling candidates for the Democratic nomination will interact on the same stage.
