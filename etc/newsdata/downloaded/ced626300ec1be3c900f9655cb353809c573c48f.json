Milner finds the mark\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThere are few players in world football, let alone the Premier League, with which you would trust a crunch injury-time penalty than James Milner.\n\nAnd when Liverpool needed him on Saturday, their Mr. Reliable stepped up, sent Kasper Schmeichel the wrong way, and handed Jurgen Klopp's men all three points.\n\nMilner is sharing duties in central midfield again this season but it is he and skipper Jordan Henderson who set the standard and ensure levels don't drop.\n\n\"Exceptional, exceptional,\" said Klopp about his No.7. \"It just sets the benchmark, that you\u2019re 33 and doing things like this. Obviously age is no issue.\u201d\n\n2. Tottenham running out of steam\n\n(Image: Mark Pain/PA Images Contributor)\n\nFew sides will be happier to see the international break than Tottenham , following a nightmare week.\n\nSpurs were battered by Bayern in the Champions League, conceding seven, and then saw themselves stuffed on the south coast.\n\nStatistics - notably pressing and running stats - and Match of the Day over the weekend pointed to a slow down from Mauricio Pochettino's men, who simply aren't getting into opponents faces as they once were and are now seemingly too easy to play against.\n\nWith a contingent of key first-team players still remaining at the club from the Argentine's first two seasons, and having grown older, maybe the message is no longer getting across.\n\n3. Dual purpose Traore disposes of City\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nSpeaking of running, few do so faster than Adama Traore.\n\nOften labelled a speed merchant, the mercurial former Barcelona junior provided the killer touch as Wolves claimed a 2-0 win over champions Manchester City , scoring twice late on at the Etihad.\n\nWhat made Traore's late show more incredible was the fact he had spent the opening 68 minutes of the match playing as a right wing-back, doing a fine job on Raheem Sterling defensively, before moving up top and making the difference.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo didn't especially trust Traore last season, but he has arguably been Wolves' best player so far this season.\n\n4. City missed Bernardo\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nManchester City have injuries - notably in defence and Kevin de Bruyne - and key personnel are out of form, but difficult to fathom right now is Pep Guardiola's decision not to play Bernardo Silva in central midfield once more.\n\nRiyad Mahrez is playing exceptionally well out wide, but without De Bruyne the clash with Wolves was the ideal opportunity to play the Portuguese in the No.8 position where he thrived for big spells last term.\n\nInstead, a midfield trio of Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva looked leaden-footed and struggled to find the space between the lines in which De Bruyne and Bernardo thrive. Gundogan stayed tight to Rodri for much of the game, attempting to protect the defence, but that only played into the away sides' hands.\n\nThe Portuguese was perhaps City's best player in 2018-19 and when De Bruyne is unavailable, he simply must start.\n\n5. What's happened to Rashford?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPerhaps Marcus Rashford is a victim of his own success, writes Aaron Flanagan.\n\nThis season has been something of a write-off for the England striker - which is something of an issue when you have been trusted to become Solskjaer's main man. Once again, it was an anonymous showing.\n\nHe looks frustrated on the pitch, worn out somewhat, and almost devoid of ideas of what to do next.\n\nRashford has not had this pressure of expectation in previous seasons and his quieter spells and maybe been overlooked.\n\nBut the failure to replace Romelu Lukaku means that no matter the situation, it's on Rashford to produce something special.\n\nOn his day, Rashford can be brilliant. But United need a striker who can score goals when it's not his day. They need some serious investment in this position - and Rashford might be the fall guy.\n\n6. Chambers staking his claim back at Arsenal\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nHector Bellerin's return to a regular starting berth may well be delayed further following the good work of Chambers at right-back, writes Darren Wells.\n\nThe versatile defender's time at the Gunners looked like it might be up when he was shipped out to Fulham on loan, but he's now staking a claim for a first-team spot.\n\nDeputising in Bellerin's role for the second game in succession, he was solid in defence and supported Pepe well in attack.\n\nHe made an important intervention to stop Josh King from scoring, and with Bellerin watching on from the stands, he did his chances of keeping him there no harm.\n\n7. Grealish steps forward\n\n(Image: Neville Williams)\n\nIn the early weeks of Aston Villa's Premier League return, Jack Grealish has stayed in the central midfield role he starred in last season.\n\nAt Carrow Road the Villans' captain played higher up, closer to Wesley with less defensive responsibility, and put the Canaries to the sword.\n\nGrealish was at his effervescent best in a 5-1 win, scoring, creating chances, at the heart of everything good about Dean Smith's side. He had more touches and made more passes in the opposing half than any other Villa player (50 and 34) and if he continues like this, then Villa will be fine and England boss Gareth Southgate will have to take notice.\n\n8. Entertainment thy name is Chelsea\n\n(Image: Chelsea FC via Getty Images)\n\nChelsea were excellent going forwards as they claimed a 4-1 win over Southampton at St Mary's with Callum Hudson-Odoi back and impressive on the left of the front three.\n\nBut Frank Lampard's men again showed their defensive fragility on the south coast, and but for some poor finishing, smart blocks and excellent last ditch tackles, would have conceded more.\n\nThe Blues are up to fifth with the three points; they've scored more than anyone bar Manchester City and Liverpool, while conceding more than anyone bar Southampton, Norwich and Watford. If you want entertainment and unpredictability, they're the side to watch.\n\n9. Palace enjoy their travels again\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nCrystal Palace effectively lulled West Ham into a false sense of security - offering little in attack, falling behind - before claiming a 2-1 win at the London Stadium.\n\nThe Eagles have 14 points from eight games so far, losing just twice, and Roy Hodgson's men continue to overachieve given the resources at the ex-England boss' disposal.\n\nAnd away from Selhurst Park in 2019, Palace have been pretty outstanding. In 13 Premier League away fixtures they have lost only four - at Liverpool, Sheffield United and twice at Spurs - drawn once and won the other eight.\n\nIf they can continue to pick up wins on the road at such a rate, and continue at home as they have been - eight points from four games so far - then could they be the most surprising of top six contenders?\n\n10. Worried about Watford\n\n(Image: Marc Atkins)\n\nWatford remain winless and managed to claim only a point at home to Sheffield United on Saturday.\n\nThe Hornets badly lack any sting without captain Troy Deeney, and while Andre Gray was guilty of missing a glaring first-half opportunity, they managed just two shots on target, only 39 percent possession and were extremely negative against the Blades.\n\nThey face Tottenham away when the international break ends and Quique Sanchez Flores needs a fast improvement.", "description": "Jurgen Klopp's men left it late to beat Leicester on Saturday, before sitting back and being given a helping hand on Sunday", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Mark Pain Pa Images Contributor", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Neville Williams"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527050.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
