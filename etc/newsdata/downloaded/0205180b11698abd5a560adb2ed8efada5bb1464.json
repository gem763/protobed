Alireza Sabahi Fard, commander of the Iranian army\u2019s Khatam ol-Anbiya Air Defense Base, as quoted by the country\u2019s Fars News Agency.\n\n\u201cThe unmanned flying object, with high flight durability, can attack targets much farther from Iran\u2019s borders and defend the country in enemy\u2019s soil,\u201d he said.\n\nThe craft, Fars reported, has \u201cconsiderable flight durability up to 24 hours and capability to carry rockets with high-precision power for day and night missions are among other features of the drone.\u201d\n\nThe release of Iran\u2019s new drone \u2014 and its ability to strike targets far beyond the nation\u2019s borders \u2014 could be seen as a warning to Israel.\n\nLast Sunday, Israeli military officials said they thwarted a \u201ckiller drone\u201d attack that Iran\u2019s Quds Forces intended to launch from an air base inside Syria. Israeli officials said Iran had moved multiple drones to the base, though it\u2019s unclear whether the craft were the same type as the drone publicly unveiled Sunday inside Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s increasing drone capabilities are a serious concern for the U.S. and its allies. Amid rising tensions in the region, the U.S. in July shot down an Iranian drone over the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIran and its proxy groups also have shot down several American drones in recent months.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
