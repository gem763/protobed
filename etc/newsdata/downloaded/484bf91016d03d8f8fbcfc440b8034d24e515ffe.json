Pre-set itineraries might offer fewer options than you\u2019d like. And what if there\u2019s a jerk on your trip?\n\nNow, travel companies are trying to make their group trips less group-like\u2014particularly at high-end firms that limit their groups to less than 20 participants. They are offering more choices of activities and finding ways to cut down on wait times. They are stepping up efforts to handle tricky group dynamics by adding new training for guides and eliminating some situations that are ripe for conflict\u2014like deciding who pays for wine at a group dinner.\n\nMany luxury travel companies say interest in group trips is up as older Gen Xers and younger baby boomers age into the prime target market for guided tours: active adults between 50 and 70. It\u2019s a cohort that wore out Eurail passes in their youth and is used to independent travel. As they get older, they often have the money and the desire for someone else to take care of the details. But the group setting can create tensions for travelers used to being independent.\n\nChristine Twiehaus traveled to Paris on an Abercrombie & Kent trip. \u2018The smaller the group, the better my chances of striking up a friendship,\u2019 she says.

Tauck, a family-owned firm that caters to travelers over 50, says it has seen \u201crecord revenues\u201d in the last several years. And Butterfield & Robinson says sales are also up in the last few years, fueled by growth in its private tours that are booked by family and friends traveling together.\n\nCompanies are also seeing a wider range of travelers in terms of age, interests and health status: They need to cater to the grandmother who loves modern art, the daughter who loves biking and the granddaughter who loves her iPhone. Social media is at play, too. With more information at guests\u2019 fingertips, they have particular ideas about which restaurants they want to visit or hikes they want to do.\n\nAs a result, travel companies say they are incorporating more personalization. Abercrombie & Kent is launching a \u201cDesign Your Day\u201d feature for all of its \u201cluxury small group journeys\u201d beginning in 2020. These trips cost about $500 to $750 per person per day. At least one day per trip, guests will have the option of several different activities. In Dubrovnik, Croatia, for example, they can go sea kayaking, take a cooking class or join a walking tour of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d shooting locations led by a guide who worked as an extra on the show. Classic Journeys unveiled a similar \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d program in 2018. At least twice during a week-long trip, guests have a choice of activities: In Iceland, they can pick a hiking outing or snorkeling in a glacial lake. Backroads, Tauck and TCS World Travel have also added more options to their group trips in recent years.\n\nTour companies are tackling a particularly loathsome aspect of group travel: Having to wait\u2014and wait\u2014in a long line with your fellow travelers to check into your hotel. In 2018, Classic Journeys began what it calls Invisible Check-In. Staffers in the company\u2019s California headquarters check guests into their hotels remotely and in advance. So when travelers arrive, they\u2019re given their room keys immediately.\n\nTravelers on Classic Journeys trips used to have to buy their own wine during group dinners. (Food was included.) But guides were noticing that the whole negotiation\u2014collectively deciding what wine to order, how much to spend and who would pay\u2014was causing bruised feelings. \u201cIf you think that guy wasn\u2019t equitable or was domineering [about the wine], then maybe you start to pick at any other little peccadilloes the person may have,\u201d says Edward Piegza, founder and president of Classic Journeys, where trips cost about $800 per person per day. So in 2018, Classic Journeys began offering complimentary wine with group dinners. \u201cWhen you remove things that might annoy each other, you give people a better chance to bond as a group,\u201d he says.\n\nClassic Journeys began offering complimentary wine at group dinners in 2018, a move the company says has improved group dynamics.

She has been on five trips with Abercrombie & Kent and usually enjoys her fellow travelers. But on a trip to the Canadian Rockies last July, two women\u2014sisters who were traveling with their mother and two other sisters\u2014were late to nearly every activity and departure, Ms. Twiehaus says, forcing everyone else to wait while the guides tried to track the sisters down. The women \u201cseemed to take turns going missing,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople would moan and groan,\u201d about the delays. (Abercrombie & Kent says when problems like constant tardiness arise, the trip\u2019s resident tour director \u201cmeets privately with guests to address the issue,\u201d says spokeswoman Pamela Lassers. )\n\nThe divisive political climate has infiltrated group tours, too. Richard Turen, a travel adviser in Naples, Fla., says he\u2019s recently had clients say, \u201cI love the idea of a group tour but I don\u2019t want to spend two weeks with people who are \u2018blank blank\u2019 supporters,\u201d he says. Butterfield & Robinson, which runs biking and walking trips that cost about $1,000 per person per day, has dossiers on all its travelers that include their hobbies, likes and dislikes\u2014and their political leanings. This way guides can be prepared to defuse contentious political discussions\u2014and even separate guests with divergent and passionate views, says Scott McEwen, Butterfield & Robinson\u2019s manager of traveler experience. Guides also try to direct the conversation. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about God. We don\u2019t talk about politics. And we don\u2019t talk about money,\u201d he says. If conversations do get heated, \u201cI\u2019ll fill up the wine glasses, turn on the music, open the windows. It\u2019s a way to change the atmosphere in the room,\u201d he says.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you ever gone on a group tour? What was your experience like? Join the conversation below.\n\nBefore Paul and Phyllis Suckow took their first trip with Abercrombie & Kent, they were worried about traveling with strangers. \u201cWe were originally very concerned about getting stuck with people that we wouldn\u2019t enjoy. I think that\u2019s everyone\u2019s greatest fear about these things and that\u2019s why a lot of people don\u2019t ever do it,\u201d says Ms. Suckow, 72, of Ardmore, Pa. But the couple was pleasantly surprised: They\u2019ve now taken seven trips with the company. \u201cWe found almost universally that the people are congenial and fairly like-minded,\u201d Ms. Suckow says. They appreciate the special access to cultural sites, like a before-public-opening-hours visit to the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and an after-hours visit to a palace in Vienna. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of sold on the group trip thing,\u201d says Ms. Suckow.\n\nPaul and Phyllis Suckow on an Abercrombie & Kent group trip in St. Petersburg, Russia. Photo: Paul and Phyllis Suckow\n\nTravel companies say they\u2019ve seen a surge in groups of families and friends booking tours, something that can create a \u201cgroup within a group\u201d phenomenon that can make other travelers feel left out. There can be other issues, too. A big group may demand changes to the itinerary or departure times, and think that, because of their numbers, other travelers should bend to their will, says Jo Zulaica, director of leader development at Backroads, which operates biking and hiking trips around the world. \u201cI think that the larger the group, the more the tendency to believe that it is a private or custom departure,\u201d she says. So, in 2016, Backroads added new training for its guides on how to handle a \u201cgroup within a group.\u201d First, the company encourages large groups to book a private trip. (Most high-end travel companies offer private guided trips for families and groups of friends, and this is a growing part of their business.) But, if the group is on a regular tour, guides are taught to gently but firmly remind them that \u201cthe leaders have to take care of everyone,\u201d says Ms. Zulaica. Guides also encourage groups to split up and sit with other travelers during at least one dinner.\n\nTara Hitchcock and Kenn Francis (here in Croatia) have taken multiple biking trips with Backroads. Photo: Tara Hitchcock\n\nTara Hitchcock, 49, who has taken eight cycling trips with Backroads, says there\u2019s an underappreciated upside to traveling with a group: It can make it easier\u2014and more fun\u2014to vacation with your spouse. (Indeed, it can be harder to fight when there\u2019s an audience.) Ms. Hitchcock\u2019s husband, Kenn Francis, 58, is a faster biker. Traveling with a group means they can each ride at their own pace without feeling like they\u2019re abandoning each other. There are other benefits, too. \u201cIt is fun to look over at your husband holding court telling a funny story you\u2019ve heard a million times,\u201d says Ms. Hitchcock, a television personality in Scottsdale, Ariz. \u201cIt reminds you of what you loved about the person when you first met.\u201d And the admiration flows both ways. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder to your spouse. I\u2019m great. In case you forgot, people think I\u2019m really fun.\u201d\n\nWrite to Andrea Petersen at andrea.petersen@wsj.com", "description": "As independent-minded Gen Xers and baby boomers take more guided trips, tour companies are trying to make the experiences feel less like group travel.", "authors": ["Andrea Petersen"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108073/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
