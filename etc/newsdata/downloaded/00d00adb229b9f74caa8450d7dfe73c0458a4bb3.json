REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) said on Tuesday it has postponed its second-quarter earnings report to mid-November, as the Indian wireless operator sought clarity on the court ruling asking telecom firms to cough up overdue payments to the government.\n\nShares of the company, which was expected to release its quarterly numbers later in the day, dropped 3.3% in early trade.\n\nThe New Delhi-based company's board, which met earlier in the day, accepted the management's recommendation to shift the September-quarter results to Nov. 14, the telecom operator said in a statement here filed to the stock exchanges.\n\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court last week upheld a demand by the country\u2019s telecoms department (DoT) that wireless carriers pay 920 billion rupees ($12.97 billion) in overdue levies and interest.\n\nThe company is approaching the DoT to seek clarity on the total amount involved and seek their support to deal with this \u201cadverse outcome\u201d, New Delhi-based Airtel said.\n\nAirtel\u2019s rivals have also expressed concerns about the court ruling. Loss-making smaller rival Vodafone Idea (VODA.NS) said it will ask the federal government for relief on payments of at least $4 billion after the court ruling.", "description": "Bharti Airtel said on Tuesday it has postponed its second-quarter earnings report to mid-November, as the Indian wireless operator sought clarity on the court ruling asking telecom firms to cough up overdue payments to the government.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446081552&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S066", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
