(Teresa Castracane/Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company)\n\nTheater critic\n\nA night of theater can often divide audiences. \u201cFairview\u201d absolutely intends to.\n\nI mean that in the most literal sense, and, if you avail yourselves of the opportunity to experience Woolly Mammoth Theatre\u2019s smashing rendition of Jackie Sibblies Drury\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning barn burner, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m talking about. And learn a bit more about what you\u2019re seeing in the changing world around you, and how you see it.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect me to give you a detailed map of Drury\u2019s swirling dramatic rapids. You\u2019ll have to discover her unique approach to discussing race, one of the most complex issues we face in this country \u2014 and one some people wish would not be discussed so loudly \u2014 on your own. I heard some harrumphs and expressions of exasperation in the Woolly auditorium, along with hearty laughs of recognition. The former made me want to say: Open your hearts and minds a little. As Drury unspools her scathingly funny satire, listen to the voice that\u2019s also declaring, \u201cThis nation does not belong to anyone. It belongs to everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one can own a seat forever. No one should,\u201d the teenage Keisha, played vibrantly by Chinna Palmer, tells us at the end of the play. People of every race and ethnicity will grasp perfectly what she\u2019s getting at in \u201cFairview.\u201d This exhilarating discourse on how white people see black people and how black people think white people see black people is meant to unseat those who occupy society\u2019s comfort zone. Or, at least, have them scoot over and make more space for the rest of the country.\n\nAs the wild structure of \u201cFairview\u201d also makes plain, this is messy, this notion of white people sharing their place at the control panels of the cultural conversation. The play, adroitly brought to comic life by director Stevie Walker-Webb, begins as a kind of familiar palliative a la TV\u2019s Huxtables: An affluent black family is preparing a birthday celebration for their elderly matriarch. The lovely Beverly (Nikki Crawford) and handsome Dayton (Samuel Ray Gates) await the arrival home of daughter Keisha, as well as of Beverly\u2019s sister, Jasmine (Shannon Dorsey), the family troublemaker. Dorsey infuses Jasmine with the giddily inflammatory inclinations of an emotional arsonist. She is out-and-out sublime.\n\nThe conflagrations that follow, though, are not of Jasmine\u2019s making. You\u2019ll soon hear the disembodied voices of white people, revealing what one might imagine white people say to one another about various ethnicities, when members of those other races aren\u2019t present. On the stage, we watch the black actors, reenacting the scene in silence, and it\u2019s a wholly disconcerting experience, hearing how the voice-over reduces the humans in front of us to stereotypes. White audience members may hear themselves saying: \u201cI don\u2019t do that.\u201d Uh huh.\n\n\n\nChinna Palmer gives a standout performance as teenager Keisha in \u201cFairview.\u201d (Teresa Castracane/Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company)\n\nMore disruptions are to come, as \u201cFairview\u201d metamorphoses ever more hilariously from naturalism to absurdism. The four white actors, first heard over the theater\u2019s speakers and briefly in shadow \u2014 the collectively splendid Cody Nickell, Kimberly Gilbert, Christopher Dinolfo and Laura C. Harris \u2014 will become more corporeally central to the action. You will be alternately delighted and appalled by what they\u2019re called on to do. This is one of those occasions in which gauging an audience\u2019s reaction is a bona fide spectator sport. Who has permission to laugh hardest at Drury\u2019s outrageous spectacle? If you\u2019re black or Latinx or Asian American, do the ironies hit you in different ways?\n\nMe, I love to be made uncomfortable in the theater \u2014 if the play is good, of course. And \u201cFairview\u201d is very good. As the white commentary becomes ever more incendiary, with the unseen characters increasingly prone to unguarded remarks, the play becomes freer, and more dangerous. (Eventually, it will go crazy.) Yes, it does go on a bit, too, but not without reason. You\u2019re kept involved because you\u2019re kept off balance. You\u2019re never quite sure how far this playwright is willing to go.\n\nDrury has said that \u201cFairview\u201d is built around the idea of \u201csurveillance,\u201d and over the course of the evening, there is that question embedded in Walker-Webb\u2019s production of who actually is looking at whom. Set designer Misha Kachman devises an entirely realistic set for a play dabbling in surreality; it recalls the physical design for another suburban play intermingled with mystery, Edward Albee\u2019s \u201cA Delicate Balance.\u201d The analogy isn\u2019t perfect: In that play, the crises of white America are of a more existential variety. But the underlying notion of disturbances in the status quo \u2014 of sowing discomfort in a white audience \u2014 doesn\u2019t feel all that dissimilar.\n\nDrury, though, is after a more vigorous intervention with our assumptions, about our views of our fellow citizens, and ourselves, as you will no doubt understand after your own encounter with \u201cFairview.\u201d This is the first play of the first season of offerings by Woolly\u2019s new artistic director, Maria Manuela Goyanes. It betokens a seamless commitment to the depth of engagement championed by her predecessor, Howard Shalwitz. And it reaffirms the admirable aspirations of the city\u2019s theaters to compel audiences to think and laugh and think some more.\n\nFairview, by Jackie Sibblies Drury.
