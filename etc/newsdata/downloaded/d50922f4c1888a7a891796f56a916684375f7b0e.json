Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe bills signed into law by the Democrat governor also ban most animals from performing in circuses, according to a report by The Hill.\n\nOn Saturday, the governor announced the bans on Twitter:\n\nCalifornia is officially the first state in the nation to ban the sale of new fur clothing. https://t.co/DktoKYYPww \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 12, 2019\n\nIn a press release Saturday, Newsom said the package of bills will \u201cfight animal cruelty and promote animal welfare\u201d and called the move \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe governor also commented on the state\u2019s decision to ban most animals, such as elephants and bears, from performing in circuses.\n\nNewsom commented:\n\nWe are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames. Just YouTube the videos showing the cruel way these animals \u2013 often stripped from their mothers as babies \u2013 are trained to do dangerous tricks. It\u2019s deeply disturbing.\n\nReports said that although the fur ban is set to take effect in 2023, consumers will still be able to buy and sell used fur products, according to The Mercury News.\n\nThe article stated this will allow stores \u201cmore than two years to sell any furs they still have in their inventory. After that, manufacturers and retailers will face fines of $500 to $1,000 for every new fur item they are caught with.\u201d\n\nHowever, Arnold Surfas, the owner of Surfas Ltd. Furriers in Orange County, said the legislation unfairly targets the fur industry and noted that the ban does not apply to imitation furs made from synthetic materials which is contrary to the state\u2019s push to reduce plastic waste.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t do their homework from the legislative side. We are low-hanging fruit,\u201d Surfas commented, adding that \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt me, but it\u2019s not going to kill me.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Assembleymember Laura Friedman (D-Glendale), who wrote the bill banning fur, praised the new legislation:\n\nToday CA made history \u2013 #AB44 was signed into law! After decades of efforts from animal welfare advocates, we are now the first state in the nation to ban fur. CA has no place for the inhumane & unsustainable treatment of animals. Now for other states to follow in our legacy. pic.twitter.com/1WVtz517ig \u2014 Laura Friedman (@laurafriedman43) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cNow for other states to follow in our legacy,\u201d she concluded.", "description": "The manufacture and sale of fur products is now banned in California, according to new legislation signed over the weekend by Gov.
