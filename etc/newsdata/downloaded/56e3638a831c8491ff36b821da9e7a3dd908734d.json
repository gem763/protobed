Tom Lee (R-Hillsborough) is unsure as to whether Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel ought to be completely removed from office.\n\nIsrael was suspended from office in January by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), due to the sheriff office\u2019s botched response to the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting.\n\nOn September 26, 2019, the Orlando Weekly reported that the Florida Senate would consider whether to uphold the suspension of \u201cCoward of Broward\u201d Sheriff Israel, effectively removing him from office, or to overturn it. Breitbart News reported that Florida\u2019s Senate Rules Committee voted Monday to uphold Israel\u2019s suspension, with Lee abstaining from participating in the vote. And even now, as the vote moves to the Senate floor, CBS Miami reports that Lee is still unsure which way he will go.\n\nThus far, Lee contends that removing Israel from office is setting a dangerous \u201cprecedent that would allow a Governor to suspend any Sheriff for the single act of a single deputy on one given day and that just defies common sense,\u201d (When Lee references a deputy he is talking about Scot Peterson, the deputy who stood outside Building 12 rather than confront the gunman while the attack was under way.)\n\nSeventeen people were killed in the attack, 14 of whom were students.\n\nLee suggested the way he votes does not matter, as he believes the vote to uphold the suspension is a foregone conclusion.\n\nStill, the vote may matter to the parents of Parkland shooting victims, who rallied last week to show their disdain for the former law enforcement official.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
