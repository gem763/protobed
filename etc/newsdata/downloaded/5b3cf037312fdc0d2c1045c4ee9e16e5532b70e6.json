We have lot of work behind the scenes (so) that this team grows in the next four years,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately it's about the big picture and we need to be patient with players that might take a bit of time to produce the type of performances we are looking forward to.\n\n\"And this is a great place to see that. What sort of character of the team we have and what sort of areas we need to really look at and look to rectify as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWith the second Test starting in Pune on Thursday, Nkwe has some quick thinking to do to start lifting his team.", "description": "Proteas interim team director Enoch Nkwe wants to channel the philosophy of title-laden Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola to turn the suffering SA side into a winning force.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9237/9f827512d98b42dfa74a315078c77fe6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
