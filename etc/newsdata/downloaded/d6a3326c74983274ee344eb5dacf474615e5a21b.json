It has quite a rigid dividend policy that is determined by the board just prior to the start of the trust\u2019s financial year and which allows shareholders to know the size of quarterly dividend payments they can expect to receive over the next 12 months.\n\nAlso, JP Morgan charges a performance fee that means the better job they do running the trust\u2019s portfolio, the higher returns investors should get \u2013 although they will also face higher fees.\n\nThe trust\u2019s shares closed Friday at \u00a33.29, implying an annual dividend yield of 4.0 per cent\n\nSo far, the trust\u2019s peculiarities have served shareholders rather well. Over the past five years, the trust has comfortably outperformed its peer group, with a return of 108 per cent (compared with an average return for global equity income funds of 69 per cent).\n\nOn the dividend front, the current quarterly dividend payment is set at 3.26p a share, compared with 3.13p last year. This means that unless there is a major deterioration in stock markets in the coming months, shareholders can look forward to three more quarterly payouts of 3.26p. The trust\u2019s shares closed Friday at \u00a33.29, implying an annual dividend yield of 4.0 per cent.\n\nTimothy Woodhouse is one of the two managers who works on the trust out of JP Morgan\u2019s New York offices. He says the three pairs of hands on the trust\u2019s tiller works well. \u2018As a trust with a global mandate, we have a lot of ground to cover,\u2019 he says. \u2018A lot of companies and analysts come through New York and London and it means we have someone there to see them.\u2019\n\nAlthough the three managers \u2013 Helge Skibeli (New York), Rajesh Tanna (London) and Woodhouse \u2013 try to reach consensual decisions on key buy and sell decisions, it is the seasoned Skibeli (29 years at JP Morgan) who has the final vote.\n\nMany of the trust's top ten holdings are growth companies\n\nDespite the income bent, the trust\u2019s 71-strong portfolio is not dominated by traditional income stocks.\n\nIndeed, many of its top ten holdings are growth companies \u2013 the likes of Alphabet and Amazon \u2013 that do not pay shareholders a dividend.\n\nWoodhouse says: \u2018We\u2019re not interested in companies that are paying a high dividend if we believe such payouts are unsustainable. We would much rather focus on companies that are operating in growth industries, have good cash flow, allocate capital sensibly \u2013 and through robust business models have a good chance of thriving long term.\u2019\n\nSuch an approach means the trust has no exposure to US telecoms companies as a result of the team\u2019s view that current dividends are unlikely to be maintained, especially if the US economy stumbles into recession.\n\nIt also has no stakes in tobacco stocks because of the possibility \u2013 however thin \u2013 of a cigarette sales ban in the US at some stage. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a recent purchase for the trust. Woodhouse says: \u2018It\u2019s innovative, continues to grow its revenues and it rewards shareholders with dividends. It ticks all our boxes.\u2019\n\nA stock jettisoned earlier this year was US home improvement retailer The Home Depot \u2013 not because of any concerns about the quality of the company, but more to do with the negative impact a recession could have on its share price.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a wonderful company for us,\u2019 says Woodhouse, \u2018but sometimes you have to be disciplined, take your profits and just move on.\u2019", "description": "Investment trust JP Morgan Global Growth & Income does things a little differently to most of its competitors.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
