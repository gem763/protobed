Roads were blocked in various places again on Sunday with burning tires, branches and rocks.\n\nSome protesters threw stones at security forces, who responded with tear gas. The CONAIE umbrella indigenous group published one video showing spear-wielding inhabitants blocking a road and shouting \"Down with the government!\"\n\nThe 66-year-old Moreno won the 2017 election and has set the oil-producing nation on a centrist track after years of socialist rule under predecessor Rafael Correa.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATE OF EMERGENCY\n\nMoreno has declared a two-month state of emergency.\n\nThough he enjoys the support of businessmen and the military, Moreno's popularity has sunk to under 30% - compared to 70% after his election - and Ecuador has a volatile history.\n\nIndigenous-led protests toppled three presidents in the decade before Correa took power in 2007.\n\nStruggling with a large foreign debt and fiscal deficit, Quito this year reached a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund that requires belt-tightening economic reforms.\n\nAs well as ending fuel subsidies, the government is reducing the state workforce and planning some privatizations. Moreno says the fuel subsidies, in place for four decades, had distorted the economy and cost $60 billion.\n\nThough transport unions stopped their action after being allowed to raise fares, other sectors have called a national strike for Wednesday.\n\nMoreno, who uses a wheelchair after a 1998 shooting during a robbery that left him paraplegic, has refused to overturn the fuel measure but said the government will increase benefits for the poor to compensate its impact.\n\nEcuador hopes to save about $1.5 billion a year from ending fuel subsidies. Along with tax reforms, the government would benefit by about $2.27 billion annually.\n\nCorrea, who lives in Belgium, calls Moreno, his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and vice-president, a \"traitor.\" (Reporting by Alexandra Valencia in Quito, Alberto Fajardo in Cayambe, Yury Garcia in Guayaquil, Carlos Garcia Rawlins in Lasso; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "description": "Ecuadorean authorities have begun arresting shopkeepers for raising food prices as indigenous groups clashed with security forces on Sunday in a fourth day of protests against President Lenin Moreno's austerity measures.
