However, when it comes to shoe design, Nike (NKE) doesn\u2019t seem to be taking Skechers\u2019 alleged copying lightly.\n\nNike filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Skechers (SKX) in federal court on Tuesday, claiming its competitor employs a \u201ccopying strategy\u201d at the behest of CEO Robert Greenberg. The Swoosh brand says that it filed the lawsuit to defend its design innovation and stop Skechers from \u201cfree-riding\u201d on Nike\u2019s significant investment in talent and resources.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Skechers is now copying two specific Nike designs: VaporMax and Air Max 270, two of the most distinctive-looking in sneakers in Nike\u2019s lineup, which have prominent and uniquely shaped air bubbles.\n\n\u201cSkechers contends it merely takes inspiration from competitor products, which it calls \u2018Skecherizing,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit states. However, Nike alleges, \u201cSkechers\u2019 business strategy includes copying its competitors\u2019 designs to gain market share.\u201d\n\nSource: Nike complaint More\n\nWhile the case only involves two types of shoes, Nike claims Skechers has infringed a dozen patents. Nike is taking a page out of Apple\u2019s (AAPL) playbook by obtaining multiple patents for one product and claiming infringment of all of those patents, according to one expert. Apple has filed a number of so-called design patents related to the iPhone and engaged in years-long litigation claiming Samsung infringed those patents.\n\n\u201cNike is able to go through and obtain patents on each of these aspects of the design. So when they sue Skechers, they could say for each of these shoes here are six different patents we think you infringed. Each one of which potentially gets this own separate damages award,\u201d says Christopher J. Buccafusco, a professor specializing in intellectual property law at Cardozo Law School.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 22: View of a Nike VaporMax sneaker at the Nike Air SNEAKEASY LA launch party on March 22, 2017 in Los Angeles, California.

They don\u2019t have to be identical, but they\u2019ve got to be pretty close to identical to infringe.\u201d\n\nThe allegations that Skechers is knocking off its competitors are not new. Back in 2016, as mentioned by Nike in the complaint, Sneaker News put out a post titled \u201cThe Most Blatant Skechers Knock-Offs.\u201d The article cites several examples of Skechers shoes that resembled those of competitors like Adidas (ADDYY) and Cole Haan.\n\nFor its part, Nike also has two other lawsuits pending against Skechers. One claims Skechers aped the design for Converse sneakers (a subsidiary of Nike), while the other claimed Skechers copied Nike\u2019s patented Nike Free and Flyknit designs.\n\nYahoo Finance did not immediately receive responses for requests for comment from Nike and Skechers.\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
