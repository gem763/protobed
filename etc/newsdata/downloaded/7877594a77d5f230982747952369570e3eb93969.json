Like any other media empire that\u2019s been ingrained in pop culture, Netflix has its own story to tell.\n\nHere are the top five things you should know about the company that transformed the way people watch movies and shows in numerous parts of the globe.\n\n1. How Netflix started\n\nNetflix was co-founded by American entrepreneur Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr. and software executive Marc Randolph in 1997, which originally offered online movie rentals. The following year it launched DVD rentals along with the sales site, Netflix.com. By 1999 and 2000, the company debuted a monthly low-cost subscription service that provided unlimited DVD rentals and a personalized movie recommendation system that allowed user ratings.\n\nIn 2005, Netflix membership reached 4.2 million according the media giant\u2019s self-reported numbers. At the start of 2019, The Hollywood Reporter declared Netflix had grown its subscriber base worldwide to 139 million. By April, Netflix increased that subscriber count by 10 million.\n\nHastings, who eventually became chief executive office of Netflix, used to tell news outlets that the conception of Netflix came to him after incurring a $40 late fee from Blockbuster. This tale can be seen in his profiles in Vanity Fair and Fortune. However, his co-founder Randolph set the record straight that the story was \u201cconvenient fiction\u201d that showed customer how Netflix differed from other video rental services at the time, according to The Washington Post.\n\n2. When Netflix went public\n\nThe rental company made its initial public offering in 2002 on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. During this time, Netflix said it had 600,000 members in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a report by Market Watch on May 23, 2002, Netflix closed at $16.75 per share, which was \u201ca gain of 12 percent over its $15 price.\u201d The stock also opened at $16.19 and rose to a volume of 7.4 million.\n\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2019, Netflix experienced a stall in its subscriber growth, which translated to its earnings. However, representatives at Netflix cited the company\u2019s lacking content releases and subscription hike during that period for the missed target.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe competition was a factor since there wasn\u2019t a material change in the competitive landscape during 2Q, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our over-forecast was in every region),\u201d Netflix executives wrote in a shareholder letter. \u201cRather, we think 2Q\u2019s content slate drove less growth in paid net [additions] than we anticipated.\u201d\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % NFLX NETFLIX INC. 269.58 +1.96 +0.73%\n\n3. Netflix and streaming\n\nNetflix evolved its business in 2007 by introducing members to streaming, which allowed customers to ditch DVD rentals in favor of instant delivery on their personal computers. The reception wasn\u2019t initially a warm one since Netflix\u2019s \u201cWatch Now\u201d service only offered 1,000 titles, according to a review by Slate at the time. That offering was one percent of what was available in Netflix\u2019s 70,000 DVD library.\n\nNetflix built up that arsenal to become the streaming giant it is today, which includes monthly rotations of feature films, documentaries, popular TV shows, mini-series and more. A report by Variety in April 2019 listed Netflix\u2019s current U.S. catalog as of at 4,000 movie titles 47,000 TV episodes\u2014which it based off estimates from market research and analytics company Ampere Analysis.\n\nA study conducted by Streaming Observer, an industry news site estimated that Netflix users watch 164.8 million hours of content per day collectively, which is equivalent to approximately 494.4 million GB of bandwidth each day if these figures are accurate.\n\nDespite all this success in the streaming market, Netflix hasn\u2019t abandoned the DVD rental game. According to a report by The Motley Fool in April, the media company still had 2.7 million DVD by-mail subscribers and made a $52 million profit from this service in its previous quarter.\n\n4. Netflix and its expansion\n\nA year after the streaming service\u2019s debut, Netflix partnered with staple consumer electronic brands to provide users direct access to streaming via Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360, Roku and LG\u2019s TV set top boxes and Samsung\u2019s Blu-ray disc players. By 2009 and 2010, Netflix snagged partnerships with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3, internet-enabled TVs, Apple mobile devices and more.\n\nOutside of device domination, Netflix began its international expansion in 2010 with its Canadian launch. A year later, it set roots throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2012, Netflix went across the pond to provide service throughout Europe. By 2015, Netflix launched in Australia, New Zealand and Japan while continuing expansion into Mediterranean markets such as Italy, Spain and Portugal.\n\nAs of 2019, Netflix is available worldwide in over 190 countries.\n\n5. Netflix and original content\n\nSix years after Netflix became a streaming service, the company finally tried its hand at original programming. It kicked off the slate with four self-produced series, including \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cHemlock Grove,\u201d \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Netflix garnered 31 primetime Emmy nominations in drama, comedy, documentary and nonfiction special categories. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d won three Primetime Emmy Awards, which made Netflix the first internet TV network to win an Emmy. By 2018, Netflix becomes the most nominated service at the Primetime and Creative Arts Emmy Awards with 112 nominations, and tied with HBO for most wins\u2014taking home 23 accolades.\n\nWhen it comes to feature films, Netflix debuted its first original motion pictures, \"Beasts of No Nation\" in 2015. Two years later, the streaming service won its first Oscar for the documentary short \u201cThe White Helmets.\u201d Netflix accomplished this feat again in 2018 with an Oscar win for best documentary feature with \u201cIcarus.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nNews organization Quartz published a report at the beginning of the year that estimated Netflix released close to 1,500 hours of content in 2018 with their original series, movies and productions.", "description": "Netflix might have taken over the world as one of the top stream services, but there's much people don't know about the media company.
