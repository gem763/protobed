The company cut electricity to more than 2 million people -- the largest preemptive blackout in the state\u2019s history -- to prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires.\n\nThe Democratic governor, who on Wednesday called the blackouts \u201cappropriate under the circumstances,\u201d took a dramatically harsher tone Thursday, blaming PG&E for not hardening its grid and saying the outage was the result of years of bad choices. His comments came just before PG&E\u2019s chief executive officer made his first public appearance, apologizing to customers for the \u201chardship\u201d the power failures have caused while defending the decision. The company said it has restored service to about 31% of customers affected.\n\nStory of \u2018Greed\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s decisions that were not made that have led to this moment in PG&E\u2019s history -- it is not conditions,\u201d Newsom said at a Thursday evening press conference in the state\u2019s emergency operations center. \u201cThis is not, from my perspective, a climate change story so much as a story of greed and neglect.\u201d\n\nNewsom said he wanted to see a \u201cmajor reorganization of this entity\u201d and said PG&E was too large to move quickly. But the governor stopped short of saying what kind of structural changes he preferred. He suggested the company needed to be far more surgical about future outages, saying some counties didn\u2019t need to be included in this week\u2019s blackouts. He acknowledged, however that such preemptive power cuts should remain an option for the state\u2019s utilities when faced with dangerous winds.\n\nPG&E, he noted, made a decision last November not to cut power near the town of Paradise during a windstorm. A transmission line then sparked the Camp Fire, the state\u2019s deadliest blaze, which killed 86 people.\n\n510,000 Without Power\n\nAfter affecting almost 750,000 accounts -- or about 2.25 million people -- the utility said about 510,000 customers in Northern California were still without power on Thursday night. The adverse weather has mostly died down, and PG&E said it would begin to inspect an unspecified subset of the 25,000 miles of transmission lines that were shutdown, a necessary precursor to restoring power.\n\nNewsom called on California utility regulators to review PG&E\u2019s actions. A spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said the agency, as a policy, reviewed all intentional outages by California utilities.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, facing an estimated $30 billion in liabilities from two consecutive years of deadly wildfires blamed on its equipment.\n\nCEO Bill Johnson, who took over in May, said the company made a determination that the blackouts were necessary for safety reasons, to ensure \u201czero risk\u201d of sparks. He told reporters at a San Francisco press conference that started an hour after the governor\u2019s that it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d the company will need to cut power again in the future. Johnson said the utility will try to be more \u201csurgical\u201d about shutoffs.\n\n\u2018We Failed\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is not how we want to serve you, this is not how we want to run our business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in the business of providing power, not taking it away.\u201d\n\nJohnson and other PG&E executives cited high wind-speed measurements in 21 of the 33 counties affected and said they found fallen tree branches on some lines that could have caught fire.\n\nThe main failure was in communicating with customers about the outages, company officials said.\n\nJohnson said the utility posted outage maps with inconsistent or inaccurate information, its website crashed and its call center was overwhelmed. \u201cWe failed our customers,\u201d said Laurie Giammona, senior vice president and chief customer officer for PG&E.\n\nThe CEO declined to respond directly to the governor\u2019s remarks, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to deal with the past, I came here to help improve the future. I haven\u2019t delved into all those matters. I might have some slight disagreement with the governor if I did.\u201d\n\nJohnson asked local residents not to take their frustrations out on PG&E workers, saying some employees had been shot at, punched and sworn at. \u201cThe buck stops with me,\u201d he said.", "description": "Governor Attacks PG&E for Blackout Caused by \u2018Greed and Neglect'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb9c79378f543f2798561dc5d4daf6e5a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
