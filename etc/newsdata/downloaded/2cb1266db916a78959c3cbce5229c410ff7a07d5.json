REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nMicrosoft said it expected \u201cintelligent cloud\u201d revenue of $11.25 billion (\u00a38.73 billion) to $11.45 billion for its fiscal second quarter, above analysts\u2019 consensus of $11.2 billion, IBES data from Refinitiv showed.\n\nRevenue from Azure grew 59% in the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, well below the 76% in the year-ago period and slightly short of analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nMicrosoft also expects \u201cdouble-digit\u201d percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for its fiscal 2020, company executives said on a conference call.\n\n\u201cThe guidance is strong,\u201d said Mark Moerdler, managing director of global software and senior analyst with Bernstein. \u201cThere were a number of people surprised that their numbers were so good for the full year.\u201d\n\nThe results sent Microsoft shares, which were up 34% for the year before the report, up 0.45% to $137.86 in after-market trading.\n\nSince Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been diversifying from its Windows operating system software, and has focused on its cloud services, which allow customers to move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft.\n\nWorldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services grew nearly 38% year-on-year in the calendar second quarter to $26.3 billion, according to data from research firm Canalys. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5% share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1%.\n\nStrength in the cloud business powered Microsoft\u2019s market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) AWS and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google.\n\nMicrosoft beat Wall Street expectations for its overall revenue and its intelligent cloud segment, which contains Azure, marking $33.1 billion in overall sales and cloud unit sales of $10.8 billion.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft\u2019s results \u201cwere strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus.\u201d\n\nBut Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.\n\n\u201cAzure came in at 59% (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60%,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it.\u201d\n\nFor a graphic on Microsoft: A Walk In The Clouds:\n\nhere\n\nInteractive graphic on Microsoft's cloud unit: tmsnrt.rs/2BzkJ75\n\nMicrosoft also beat expectations in other segments. It forecast sales from a division that includes LinkedIn and Office software to range from $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimate of $11.4 billion.\n\nThe technology company\u2019s personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its first-quarter revenue posted on Wednesday, rising 4% to $11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.\n\nWindows results were boosted by 19% revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a 7% decline for consumer PCs.\n\nMike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops.\n\nBut Microsoft forecast current-quarter revenue of $12.6 billion to $13 billion for the personal computing division, below analysts\u2019 consensus estimate of $13.38 billion.\n\nNet income rose 21% to $10.68 billion, or $1.38 per share, while total revenue rose 14% to $33.06 billion.
