But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nTrump has frequently used the phrase \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and deployed other politically explosive language to denigrate the work of former special counsel Robert Mueller and various congressional investigations into his administration.\n\nBut the invocation of the term \u201clynching\u201d to characterize a legislative process explicitly sanctioned by the Constitution marks a new, racially insensitive measure of malice by the president toward lawmakers\u2019 impeachment efforts.\n\nIn other tweets Tuesday morning, touted his approval rating among Republican voters, referenced various \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segments, and applauded GOP support for a failed resolution to censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) \u2014 one of the leaders of the impeachment inquiry.", "description": "The comment marks a new, racially insensitive measure of malice by the US president toward lawmakers\u2019 impeachment efforts.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey", "Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney", "Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182505243-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
