Most recently, Canadian bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin joined the network.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is that with Liquid we are building a network effect. It\u2019s a slow procedure because, unlike ICO [initial coin offering] projects, we are not printing our own token and we can't give somebody a million dollars to integrate Liquid into their exchange. We have to just build it based on the merit of their technology and the utility of the technology and that's going to be a slower-moving process, which means we're not going to be driving revenues on products built on top of liquid as quickly,\u201d Mow said during an interview at the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, Latvia, in September.\n\nMeanwhile, their cryptocurrency mining business is already generating \u201ca large portion\u201d of their revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have pretty good margins because we've secured very cheap power and we are very effective and efficient with our operations,\u201d the CSO said.\n\nWhile the company began mining Bitcoin in 2017, this past August they announced a new major product, Blockstream Mining, which provides mining equipment colocation in their data centers in Quebec, Canada.\n\nAccording to Mow, with this product, the company is currently targeting large institutional clients only: \u201cBut the goal is that down the road we can support smaller miners, smaller customers.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company is working on new products that are related to their main business units - the Liquid and mining businesses.\n\n\u201cWith Blockstream satellite we can potentially set up mining operations in the areas where there is no internet. There might be cheap power available but there is no internet. But based on the new tech that we are building out for the satellite umbrella, we can do some interesting things with mining and broadcasting of transactions as well,\u201d Mow said, adding that their satellite is close to covering 99% of the Earth surface and they are working to fill the missing gaps, such as in Georgia.\n\nAlso, while Mow is working on a new initiative that would help projects being built on Liquid to receive venture capital investments, the CSO did not rule out that Blockstream itself might be looking to raise fresh capital to finance their own growth.\n\n____\n\nWatch the whole interview with Samson Mow, where he:", "description": "While mining operations have become a \u201ccash cow business\u201d for Blockstream, this major, U.S.-based blockchain company now puts its main focus on building their Liquid network, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) Samson Mow told Cryptonews.com.", "authors": ["Linas Kmieliauskas", "Eimantas \u017demaitis"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d8/c5d16ccc32.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
