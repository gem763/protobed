I asked then if she would like a speaking part.\n\n\u2018Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: \u201cOf course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me.\u201d\n\nThe monarch was \u2018rescued\u2019 by Daniel Craig in the sketch (Picture: BBC)\n\nShe said the line: \u2018Good evening, Mr Bond\u2019 (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018I asked if she would like to say \u201cGood evening, James\u201d, or: \u201cGood evening, Mr Bond\u201d, and she chose the latter, knowing the Bond films.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then relayed the news to Mr Boyle, adding: \u2018I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen\u2019s only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line.\u2019\n\nMs Kelly has written a book on her life assisting the Queen, entitled The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe.\n\nIn another extract, published in Hello! magazine, the dressmaker revealed how she wears in the monarch\u2019s shoes and previously used Yorkshire Tea to dye the royal christening dress.\n\nWhile on one occasion, she was struggling to find trimmings for the Queen\u2019s ascot hat and drew inspiration from a plant pot in the room.\n\nExtracts of Angela Kelly\u2019s book have been published in Hello! magazine (Picture: PA)\n\nMs Kelly revealed her close bond with the monarch (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nMs Kelly said: \u2018I went looking for Paul Whybrew, the Queen\u2019s Page, for a solution. I found him in Her Majesty\u2019s storeroom, where something immediately caught my eye.\n\n\u2018In a corner, a modest plant pot contained snake\u2019s-head fritillaries in exactly the same cerise shade as the Queen\u2019s Ascot outfit. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u2019\n\nEU agrees to delay Brexit until January next year\n\nThe fritillaries were made of silk and so after they had been \u2018well dusted\u2019, they were applied to Her Majesty\u2019s hat.\n\nMs Kelly also revealed the Queen\u2019s sense of humour, stating that she once played an April Fool\u2019s joke on her by placing a cuddly toy kookaburra on her balcony while they were in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the monarch realised the bird wasn\u2019t real, she immediately told her aide: \u2018You\u2019re sacked!\u2019 before turning to Prince Charles and exclaiming: \u2018Angela has had me!\u2019\n\nMichelle Obama and the Queen were pictured with their arms around each other (Picture: Rex /Shutterstock)\n\nSilk flowers were used to decorate the Queen\u2019s hat at Ascot (Picture: PA)\n\nMs Kelly said: \u2018I\u2019m pleased to say the toy is with us in Windsor Castle and has pride of place on the back of the sofa in the Queen\u2019s sitting room.\n\n\u2018I laugh to myself every time I see it.\u2019\n\nMore than 110 flood alerts issued with roads submerged and rivers overflowing\n\nThe book also discusses the Queen\u2019s meeting with Michelle Obama during a state visit to the UK in 2009, in which the pair were pictured with their arms around each other.\n\nAccording to Ms Kelly, the tactile moment was down to Her Majesty\u2019s ability to make \u2018everyone feel so relaxed\u2019.\n\nShe described an \u2018instant and mutual warmth\u2019 being shared between the two women, before noting that in that particular situation \u2018there is no protocol that must be adhered to\u2019.\n\nHello! magazine is now available to buy (Picture: PA)\n\nMs Kelly said: \u2018In reality, it was a natural instinct for the Queen to show affection and respect for another great woman.\n\n\u2018When fondness is felt or the host of a State Visit goes to guide Her Majesty up some steps, it truly is about human kindness and this is something the Queen will always welcome warmly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe is available to buy from October 29.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
