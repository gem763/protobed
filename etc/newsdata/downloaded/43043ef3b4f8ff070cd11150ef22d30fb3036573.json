In those exchanges, Sondland said Trump had \"been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.\"\n\nPHOTO: FILE - In this July 10, 2018, file photo, President Donald Trump is joined by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, second from right, as he arrives at Melsbroek Air Base, in Brussels, Belgium. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) More\n\nA lawyer for Sondland didn\u2019t immediately respond to ABC\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRepublican lawmakers -- and Trump himself -- have pointed to this text as evidence that Trump did not participate in any wrongdoing. But sources familiar with Sondland's testimony told ABC News that he's expected to tell congressional investigators that he had spoken to the president before sending that text message and he was just relaying what the president told him, not because he had any direct knowledge on the matter.\n\n(MORE: 'Crazy to withhold security' aid to Ukraine for political campaign: Top US diplomat )\n\nVolker and Sondland were working with Zelenskiy and his top aides to secure a White House meeting between Trump and the new president -- eager for U.S. support. In the texts, first obtained by ABC News, they make clear to a top Zelenskiy aide that in a July 25 phone call, Zelenskiy must convince Trump that \"he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened in 2016'\" in order for them to \"nail down date for visit to Washington,\" as Volker writes.\n\nDuring that call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to \"do us a favor\" and work with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to open investigations, and then invited him to reach out to set up a visit to the White House.\n\n(MORE: 5 things to know about those encrypted texts US diplomats exchanged on Ukraine)\n\n\"Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call,\" Trump said on the call, according to a rough transcript released by the White House. \"Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.\u201d\n\nThe text messages raised eyebrows from Democrats who said the messages could be used as additional evidence that Trump had conditioned U.S. security assistance and meetings with Ukraine's leader on the opening of a politically beneficial investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's relationship with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.\n\nTo date, Zelenskiy still has not visited Trump at the White House, but the two leaders did meet in late September at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the European Union is expected to testify Thursday that he believed that a Ukrainian government statement announcing investigations requested by President Donald Trump was a condition for a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sources familiar with", "authors": ["Katherine Faulders"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4wr8Nox1o7oXRQarjD8y5A--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/ukraine_sondland_hpMain_20191017-080249_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
