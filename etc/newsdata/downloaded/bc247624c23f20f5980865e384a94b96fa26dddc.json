The elite media headlines scream, \u201cSupport for Impeachment Rises!\u201d Yeah, to 44 percent or 46 percent, which means only Democrats are on board.\n\nSo what?\n\nThe NRCC poll found that in battleground congressional districts, meaning the districts that will be up for grabs in 2020, that \u201cTwo-thirds (63%) of voters in NRCC target seats and 66% of voters in Republican-held battleground seats agree that Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with impeaching the President[.]\u201d\n\nWhat voters would prefer, according to the poll, is a Congress \u201cworking on issues they campaign on such as funding our military, improving the nation\u2019s infrastructure, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and caring for our nation\u2019s veterans.\u201d\n\nIn worse news for Democrats, \u201cthe top priority for voters in NRCC target seats is immigration and in Republican-held battleground seats is the economy.\u201d\n\nThe NRCC found six separate issues, \u201cthat reach double digit importance for voters and Democrats aren\u2019t focusing on any of them.\u201d\n\nOn the overall issue of impeachment, the NRCC numbers align with the polls we are seeing from the media, polls that once again show nothing more than the Democrats consolidating their base of support on the issue.\n\n\u201cIn NRCC target seats, voters oppose impeachment: 44% support \u2013 47% oppose. In Republican-held battleground seats voters oppose impeachment: 46%-49%.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in these target districts, 51 percent of Independents oppose impeachment and 46 percent of \u201cvoters in NRCC target seats are less likely to vote for a candidate for congress who supports impeachment.\u201d\n\nFeel free to write the poll off as partisan, but as I mentioned above, it aligns perfectly with the media\u2019s impeachment polls and analysis from the Wall Street Journal, which is no fan of Trump:\n\nThere is no position Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn can take on impeaching President Trump that will satisfy a majority of voters in the district she narrowly won last year, which Mr. Trump won by nearly 14 points. Republicans say the House probe, which was designated an impeachment investigation last week, is a baseless attempt to undo the 2016 election. They dismiss Ms. Horn\u2019s technical objection to the impeachment label\u2014she is among roughly 10 House Democrats to do so\u2014as politically transparent. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want her to align with progressives and back impeachment, while others want to avoid a battle that could prove costly to taxpayers. \u2026 Ms. Horn beat a Republican incumbent last year by about 3,000 votes in a district that wasn\u2019t on Democrats\u2019 radar because of Mr. Trump\u2019s margin of victory in 2016. Speaking after a town hall Monday, she called \u201cirresponsible\u201d her colleagues\u2019 decision to move toward impeachment without a full investigation beyond the release of the transcript of the president\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and whistleblower complaint.\n\nDemocrats are also facing opposition to impeachment through anti-impeachment protesters, and some of those Democrats, like Rep. Lucy McBath (D-GA), are not handling the unexpected blowback very well. Her office dialed 911 on the protesters and had them removed by police.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the current frontrunner for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination, also got a taste of the protests.\n\nNevadans greeted @ewarren in Reno and let them know exactly how they feel about the Democrats\u2019 despicable attempt to impeach @realDonaldTrump and undo the 2016 election.
