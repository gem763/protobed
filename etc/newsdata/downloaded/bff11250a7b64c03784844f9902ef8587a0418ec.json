Is that something that the agency has a particular expertise on, is it in their wheelhouse?\u201d Crandall said shortly after the committee was formed.\n\nMiranda Green contributed reporting.", "description": "A committee that reports to the National Park Service (NPS) is recommending privatizing campgrounds within national parks, limiting benefits for senior visitors and allowing food trucks as a way to bring more money", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tetons-nationalpark-getty2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
