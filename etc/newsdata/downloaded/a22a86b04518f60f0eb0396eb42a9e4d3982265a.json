The man was conscious when taken to hospital, police added, but his condition was not immediately available on Wednesday.\n\nMTR Corp shut nearly 50 stations to stop protesters moving around on Tuesday, making the rail operator once again a target of vandalism. Demonstrators have stepped up attacks on the MTR, which has been blamed for closing stations at the government\u2019s behest.\n\nBy early Wednesday, all metro stations were open although some lines were running slower than normal as MTR workers tried to repair damage to ready the service for the nearly 6 million people who use it every day.\n\nMany stores and business had closed on Tuesday after demonstrators vowed to seize the opportunity on China\u2019s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage.\n\nThe protests have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and pose the gravest popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.\n\nThe demonstrations have also taken a growing toll on the city\u2019s economy as it faces its first recession in a decade and comes as the central government is already grappling with a U.S.-China trade war and a global slowdown.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nChina dismisses those claims and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Hong Kong awoke to widespread damage on Wednesday and calls for more protests following some of the most violent clashes in nearly four months of unrest, including the shooting of a teenage demonstrator by police.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436071618&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9102F", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
