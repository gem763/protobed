Its next tenant will be \u201cGirl from the North Country\u201d in March. Broadway producers lately have been creative about using the theater spaces when vacant, including programing concerts, magic shows and improv performances.\n\nWhile unprecedented these days, turning the 1,000-seat Belasco into a movie house is an echo from the past. Almost every Broadway theater that is still standing was converted to showing movies, recording radio broadcasts, or being used as a TV recording studio at some point in Times Square\u2019s seedier days, says Tim Dolan, a Broadway historian who is owner of the Broadway Up Close Walking Tours Inc.\n\nThe mobster flick \u201cThe Irishman\u201d stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. It represents a big risk for Netflix, which ponied up $159 million to make \u201cThe Irishman\u201d after other studios passed.\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Broadway will be turning back the clock next month when it converts one of its august theaters into a movie theater and starts screenings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/422981_2019-nyff-irishman-world-premiere-01928-joe-pesci-al-pacino-joe-pesci-left-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
