Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said he \u201cregretted\u201d shoving offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy on the sidelines during Sunday night\u2019s 19-13 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n\u201cI mean, we're good,\u201d Kelce said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved on as a team from last game. Me and coach Bieniemy have a very close relationship. I love him. He's helped me out tremendously as a person, as a professional and I'm sure he'll keep doing that throughout the rest of my career. Just what happened on the sideline, sometimes in football you get a little heated with your brothers or your coaches. Sometimes you\u2019ve just got to rally the family together and let everybody know that we\u2019re in this together to win a game.\n\n\u201cI mean, you guys saw me hug him afterwards I love the guy. That\u2019ll never change. I appreciate him being on my tail to get me going.\u201d\n\n100 WORST NFL TEAMS OF ALL TIME: Could Dolphins, Redskins join most hopeless in history?\n\nThe loss was Kansas City\u2019s first of the 2019 season, and the Chiefs looked uncharacteristically stagnant on offense. The team was held to its lowest scoring output since Mahomes, last season's MVP, became the starting quarterback in 2018.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second quarter. NBC cameras caught Kelce and Bieniemy having a discussion before the tight end appeared to grow irritated and shoved the coordinator aside. Offensive guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif pulled Kelce away, and offensive tackle Cam Erving removed Bieniemy from the confrontation.\n\nThe NBC cameras then showed an image of Kelce going over to hug Bieniemy after the incident to move on from it.\n\n\u201cHe's like a father figure, in terms of being there for me on the field,\u201d Kelce said, according to ESPN. \u201cWe're wired a little bit the same when it comes to our competitive edge. ... It's something immediately I regretted and I just wanted to make it good and let him know that, \u2018You know what? I'm ready to rock and roll for you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the loss, Kelce caught just four of 10 targets for 70 yards.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "After becoming frustrated in Sunday's loss, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce shoved offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy.
