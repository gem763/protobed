For example, the wave absorbed from an athlete jumping onto a force plate generates force production data that can predict an elbow injury, Wagner said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to pair up and match these machine learning patterns with these specific injuries to the point we are making discoveries we never thought were possible.\u201d\n\nSparta technology is used in the National Football League scouting combines where league scouts evaluate the top draft-eligible college players.\n\nWagner said the technology is mostly used in colleges because of the abundance of football programs in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He hopes Sparta Science is able to trickle down to help youth sports organizations where most of the injuries are happening.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe Sparta software assists the military in predicting, diagnosing and prescribing personal plans to optimize health and performance.\n\n\u201cThe biggest loss of some of these assets and individuals is in the military, Wagner said. \u201cThe Marines alone lost 111 million last year due to injury.\u201d", "description": "Sparta Science gathers movement patterns from different athletes and pair it with specific injuries to reduce the outcome.", "authors": ["Henry Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201907/1446/0/0/854081161001_6064259874001_6064255201001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-07-26"}
