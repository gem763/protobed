U.S. rival Boeing Co <BA.N> has large manufacturing operations in the north of the state.\n\nMobile city leaders and Alabama lawmakers had lobbied hard for exemptions from the tariffs, arguing they could jeopardize some 1,000 jobs.\n\nAlabama's largely conservative voters supported U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and he continues to poll very strongly in the state.\n\nThe surprise decision to omit imported aircraft sections came in a list of tariffs that was smaller in percentage terms and in scope than initially signaled by Washington.\n\nThe United States said on Wednesday it expected the European Union to enter negotiations but stressed it also had authority to increase the tariffs or alter the products affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nNORTHERN IRELAND REPRIEVE\n\nAlso spared by the decision to exempt imported aircraft parts were wings made in Northern Ireland for smaller Airbus A220 aircraft, which had been drawn into a separate row in 2017.\n\nThe planes are mainly built in Canada where they were originally designed by industrial group Bombardier <BBDb.TO> before Airbus bought the loss-making program last year.\n\nBut in August, Airbus also began building the planes in Mobile, adding plans for 400 jobs to 850 already in place.\n\nA dispute over low prices for the jets sucked Boeing into a three-way trade row with Canada and Britain in 2017 and caused a political storm about politically sensitive jobs in Belfast.\n\nFor now, both those jobs and the new A220 jobs in Alabama appear to be sheltered from the latest dispute.\n\nAirbus said it was evaluating the tariff list in close collaboration with the European Commission.\n\nDespite relief over Airbus, Alabama is bracing for tariffs that could hit Germany's Daimler, which operates a large Mercedes auto plant in Tuscaloosa, beginning next month.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imported cars from Germany and elsewhere in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jane Wardell)", "description": "WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Alabama aerospace workers won an unexpected reprieve from escalating trade tensions on Wednesday when the United States spared an Airbus plant in the state from the impact of tariffs against the European planemaker - at least for now.
