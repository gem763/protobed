Folks who were already invested in it since the genesis became overnight millionaires and billionaires. Lots became self-proclaimed bitcoin traders and investors. Even then, quite a lot have remained ignorant about a few facts.\n\nFor newcomers to Bitcoin and \u2018veteran Bitcoiners\u2019 alike, these 5 points are worth knowing:\n\nA Hacker Generated 184 Billion Bitcoins In 2010\n\nOn August 15th, 2010, in something known as the \u201cvalue overflow incident\u201d, an unknown hacker attacked the bitcoin blockchain creating 184,467,440,737.09551616 BTC out of thin air! This took place at block height 74638.\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto quickly got to work. Version 0.3.1 was released within 5 hours of the incident, which prevented future printing of Bitcoins via this exploit. The 184 billion bitcoins were erased.\n\nThe chain generated from BTC version 0.3.1 became the dominant blockchain everyone uses today.\n\nBitcoin Is Father To 430 Altcoins\n\nAs of date, 2651 cryptocurrencies have found their way in the market. But, what\u2019s interesting is that 436 of these have come from Bitcoin via direct or indirect forks.\n\nThe exact name of the altcoins, along with their source/root have been beautifully mapped out by Map of Coins. Bitcoin\u2019s forks have always tried to notch up and match BTC but have ostensibly failed. Bitcoin Cash is the most prominent example.\n\nFirst Bitcoin Faucet Distributed 5 BTC Per Visitor\n\nA bitcoin faucet is a reward system, in the form of a website or app, that dispenses rewards in the form of a satoshi, which is a hundredth of a millionth BTC, for visitors to claim in exchange for completing a captcha or task as described by the website.\n\nGavin Andresen created the first Bitcoin faucet in June 2010, which distributed a generous (considering the price today) 5 BTCs to every visitor. The aim was to promote the adoption and use of Bitcoin.\n\n~732,000 Addresses Own At Least 1 BTC\n\nAs reported by Bitcoinist, there are only 732,982 addresses that hold more than 1 BTC. Compared to over 20 million known addresses, this figure represents a small amount of \u201cwhole bitcoin\u201d owners.\n\nEvery single one out of the top 10o addresses has been accumulating a significant amount of BTC. It seems these folks are already considering the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency becoming a dominant store of value in the near future, as only a handful of these accounts show outflows.\n\nAs Bitcoinist contributing author, Osato Avan Nomayo puts it aptly:\n\nConsidering the global population is roughly 7.5 billion, out of which 36 million are millionaires, it will become increasingly difficult in time for even wealthy people to own at least 1 BTC.\n\nSatoshi Is Not The Smallest Unit of BTC\n\nA lot of folks are of the notion that Satoshi is the smallest measurable unit of Bitcoin, as 1 Satoshi equals 0.00000001 BTC.\n\nThere is actually an even smaller BTC unit that is already being used within the Lightning Network. This is the Millisatoshi (MSAT) which represents one-thousandth of Satoshi.\n\nWe, therefore, have the following:\n\n1 SAT = 1000 MSAT\n\n1 SAT = 0.00000001 BTC\n\n1 MSAT = 0.00000000001 BTC\n\nWhat do you think about the aforementioned BTC facts?
