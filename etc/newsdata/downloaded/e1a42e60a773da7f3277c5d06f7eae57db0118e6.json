But it said it \"will not comment on the identity of the driver\".\n\nMedia identified her husband as Jonathan Sacoolas, who worked at RAF Croughton, near the town of Brackley, which is home to the 422nd Air Base Group.\n\n'Immunity is rarely waived'\n\nIn a statement, Northamptonshire Police said the driver had initially \"engaged fully\" with their investigation and said she had no plans to leave Britain, but had now left.\n\n\"If we can't resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House,\" Johnson said.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has raised the case with US ambassador Woody Johnson and also brought it up in a call Monday with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nRaab \"reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider,\" a Foreign Office spokesman said.\n\nNorthamptonshire police said they were working through \"diplomatic channels\" to try to contact their suspect, who was never arrested.\n\nThe victim's mother, Charlotte Charles, said she needed to know who killed their son to start the grieving process.\n\n\"We just don't understand how you can just get on a plane and leave behind the devastation she has without even speaking to us or facing us, or an apology of any kind,\" she said.\n\nCharles added: \"She's got to be suffering as well - she's a mum.\n\n\"Without knowing who this person is properly, we can't begin to try and start our grieving process.\"\n\nIn a statement received by AFP on Sunday, the US Embassy in London offered condolences to the victim's family.\n\n\"Any questions regarding a waiver of the immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels,\" it said.\n\n\"(They) are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived.\"", "description": "Anne Sacoolas is suspected of being involved in the death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn, who was hit riding his motorbike.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/2610cfd9eca84d9e91b962cf1ab10b79_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
