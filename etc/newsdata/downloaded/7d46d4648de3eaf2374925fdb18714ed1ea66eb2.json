Aggressive Downing Street briefings following Boris Johnson\u2019s phone call with Angela Merkel on Tuesday morning have led to rebukes from Donald Tusk and to Jean-Claude Juncker accusing the UK of committing the \u2018original sin\u2019. To what extent Merkel really did demand the annexation of Northern Ireland is unclear. What this week\u2019s events have proved is that keeping Britain in the customs union was always the EU\u2019s main priority.\n\nThe proposals put forward by Boris Johnson that have led Britain to this point were an improvement on the previous surrender treaty, but they were never going to be accepted in full by the EU. For one thing, the next few years would have relied entirely on the good faith of Brussels \u2013 something that has been in short supply since 2016.\n\nI understand why Johnson set off on this rocky road. Keeping his split party together and possibly gaining a majority in parliament are undeniably important. But, frankly, I am pleased that this latest proposed deal is now all but dead. In fact, I\u2019m feeling more optimistic about Brexit than I have for a long time. The choice is looking clearer.
