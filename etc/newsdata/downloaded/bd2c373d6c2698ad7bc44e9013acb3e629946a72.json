(AP) - Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma will be sidelined at least until mid-October with a stress reaction in his left foot.\n\nThe Lakers announced the extent of Kuzma\u2019s injury Thursday before the start of training camp.\n\nKuzma was injured while training with the U.S. national team in August. He still hasn\u2019t been cleared for practice or game participation, and the Lakers won\u2019t learn more until he undergoes an MRI exam after they return from a preseason trip to China around Oct. 13.\n\nKuzma is the sole remaining member of the Lakers\u2018 young core, most of which was traded for Anthony Davis in July.\n\nThe Lakers will hold their annual media day Friday ahead of their first formal practice under new coach Frank Vogel.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma will be sidelined at least until mid-October with a stress reaction in his left foot.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
