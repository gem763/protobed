The shares at this writing were up about $40 for a gain of 16% in Thursday morning trading.\n\nFor many years I have been quite negative on Tesla's operating outlook and its share price, but I generally have refused to short the stock.\n\nLet me explain, because as a professional short-seller there is a very important lesson to be learned.\n\nA basic short-selling tenet of mine is to avoid shorting any stock with high short interest ratios, whether measured against days to cover or as a percentage of a company's (share) float.\n\nThis view is a function not only of my own and my investors' risk profile and appetite, but honestly it has practical application for almost anyone navigating in the short-selling world.\n\nI cannot emphasize this precept greater -- it has saved me an enormous amount of money and sleep.\n\nThere are 36 million shares of Tesla short, representing a high six days to cover based on average daily trading volume of six million shares over the last ten days and representing an elevated 28% of the float of 140 million shares.\n\nA year and a half ago I wrote, \"Why I Won't Short Tesla.\" To wit:\n\nThis morning Tesla's (TSLA) shares are trading +$17 on better-than-anticipated production results.\n\nI receive more emails, mostly from suffering short sellers on Tesla than any stock I write about. The higher the share price, the greater the desperation from the Bears.\n\n\n\nTesla \"just became a real car company,\" Elon Musk says after hitting a critical milestone https://t.co/eHWQ3HEHDo pic.twitter.com/uTf91v2uTm - Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) July 2, 2018\n\nI will never short Tesla in the future.\n\nIn shorting a stock, remember risk/reward is asymmetric. A short can only return 100% (a bankruptcy) but can rise to indefinite heights.\n\nAs it relates to Tesla, never short conceptual shorts or high valuation without a catalyst. I have the investment scars on my back, from speculative booms years ago (that I resisted), to make that statement.\n\nMost importantly, avoid shorts when the outstanding short interest exceeds five days of average trading volume and/or a high percentage (greater than 7%) of the float.\n\nLife is too short to be caught in short squeezes (like currently seen in Tesla).\n\nTrust me on this, please.\n\nMy Tesla Street Cred\n\nOver the last decade I have written more about Tesla than any other company extant.\n\nAlmost all of my analysis was downbeat.\n\nHere are some examples of only some of the columns I have posted in only the last two years:\n\n* Tesla has gone plaid.\n\n* On making money, good ideas\\ and chasing shiny objects.\n\n* Tesla's downward spiral is no surprise to me.\n\n* More intel on Tesla.\n\n* Still stay away from Tesla.\n\n* Tesla talk.\n\n* Another short-selling lesson.\n\n* Tesla: Never mind!\n\n* Can Lucid Air take on Tesla?\n\n* The absurdity of a Tesla takeover.\n\n* Examining Elon Musk's blog.\n\n* Riddle me this, Tesla.\n\n* Five reasons why I doubt Tesla will go private.\n\n* The Tesla Twitter fiasco.\n\n* My view on Tesla bonds.\n\n* A Tesla analysis.\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nI always begin with the notion that short-selling is not for most; it requires far more price discipline than long buying as reward vs. risk is asymmetric and it also requires more of a deep analytical dive as Wall Street tends to usually have a positive spin on companies, sectors and markets.\n\nTrafficking in high short-interest stocks makes short-selling much more difficult and dangerous, as Tesla shorts have realized here on Thursday.\n\nAvoid selling short a company with a high short interest.\n\nThis is a core short-selling doctrine that will save you a large amount of money and sleep.\n\n(This commentary originally appeared on Real Money Pro on October 24.
