We have got to keep the pressure on ISIS so they don\u2019t recover,\u201d Mattis said in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d set to air Sunday.\n\nMattis\u2019 warning comes after Trump announced last week that the U.S. will move special operation teams away from the Syrian border as Turkey launches an offensive against Kurdish forces. The Kurds have long fought alongside the U.S. against the Islamic State in the region.\n\n\u201cYou can pull your troops out, as President Obama learned the hard way, out of Iraq but the \u2018enemy gets the vote\u2019 as we say in the military. And in this case, if we don\u2019t keep the pressure on then ISIS will resurge. It\u2019s, it\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back,\u201d Mattis continued.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
