The major pressure point allegedly was a series of secret settlements with women who had accused \u201cToday\u201d show co-host Matt Lauer of misconduct, including an alleged rape (Lauer said last week that all of his workplace relationships were consensual).\n\nBut Oppenheim directly disputed this: There were no settlements before Lauer\u2019s firing in November 2017, he said, and no coverup.\n\n\u201cWe have no secrets and nothing to hide,\u201d he wrote on Monday to NBC and MSNBC staffers. He added, \u201cThere is no evidence of any reports of Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no \u2018hush money\u2019 \u2014 no way we have found that NBC\u2019s current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOppenheim \u2014 whom Farrow paints as obstructionist and dishonest in \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d \u2014 called the book \u201ca smear.\u201d\n\nIn response, Farrow\u2019s publisher, Little, Brown and Co., released its own 10-page memo, with a point-by-point counter-response to Oppenheim\u2019s point-by-point response.\n\n\u201cIf NBC is so certain of their facts, why not release the women [who signed nondisclosure agreements with the network] and let them speak for themselves?\u201d it asks.\n\nIf anything, NBC\u2019s vigorous campaign against Farrow seems likely to gin up even more interest in his book. \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d is the second best-selling title on Amazon\u2019s bestseller list (behind Elton John\u2019s autobiography), thanks to strong presale orders.\n\nAD\n\nIt also is likely to keep alive questions raised by NBC News employees about NBC\u2019s handling of the Weinstein matter. Farrow walked away from NBC in August 2017, frustrated by management\u2019s hesitance on the story, and published his reporting in the New Yorker magazine seven weeks later. His story won the Pulitzer Prize and helped propel the #MeToo movement.\n\nAD\n\nNBC says the story wasn\u2019t ready at the time, that Farrow didn\u2019t have any named sources on the record when he walked away.\n\n\u201cThis is a news organization that at best has no idea what\u2019s going on inside its own organization,\u201d said one producer at the network, who requested anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak about NBC. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t ignorant, they were something worse.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe controversy is one of the biggest involving a network news division\u2019s handling of a story since 2004, when CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes II\u201d reported about President George W. Bush\u2019s National Guard service. CBS and anchor Dan Rather initially defended the controversial story, which relied on possibly forged documents; a subsequent investigation by a CBS-appointed panel criticized the reporting of it. The episode ultimately led to Rather\u2019s demise as the network\u2019s leading anchor.\n\nAD\n\nIn his memo, Oppenheim said a review of NBC\u2019s personnel files by its legal team shows there were no Lauer-related complaints before 2017 and that severance agreements with women who left NBC News were \u201croutine.\u201d\n\nAmong others, he said former \u201cToday\u201d anchor Ann Curry relayed only a vague complaint about Lauer in 2010 to two executive \u2014 that Lauer \u201chad a problem with women\u201d \u2014 which Curry based on another woman\u2019s account. Oppenheim said one of the executives in whom Curry allegedly confided denied she was told this.\n\nAD\n\nThis is at odds with Farrow\u2019s reporting. He asserts that there were at least seven harassment complaints, including several against Lauer, and that NBC paid hush money to complainants, disguising the purpose of these payments by referring to them as \u201cenhanced severance.\u201d\n\nIn his memo and a 10-page \u201cFact Sheet\u201d responding to many of Farrow\u2019s claims, Oppenheim wrote that he received just one call from Weinstein while Farrow was reporting the story for NBC and that Oppenheim made no commitments or promises during the call. NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack also received a call from Weinstein but told Weinstein he was unaware of Farrow\u2019s work at the time, according to Oppenheim.\n\nMSNBC President Phil Griffin received 13 calls from Weinstein, Oppenheim said, but Griffin had no role in supervising Farrow.\n\nSarah Ellison contributed to this story.\n\nAD", "description": "Network disputes account in \u2018Catch and Kill\u2019 and denies coverup of reporting about Harvey Weinstein.", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YmZUnmyhlcrc8wZ3mApNo3zZG8M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YMPXT5XK4AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
