Twitter TWTR, +2.82% didn\u2019t hold back:\n\nThey're struggling as I drag them to the guillotine \u2014 Fiona, Lesbian Anarcho Demon Witch (@GayestTiefling) September 30, 2019\n\nUnderstandably, those working two jobs to pay for their home and feed their kids weren\u2019t exactly shedding any tears for the coastal elites who are having trouble paying nosebleed prices for preschool. It\u2019s all about perspective.\n\nThe ruckus drew a certain high-profile D.C. figure into the mix:\n\nFair enough.\n\nBut the New York congresswoman, a former bartender who has taken up the fight for equality, also has to know that it\u2019s possible to scramble financially even with a generous six-figure income in money-draining cities like D.C. and San Francisco.\n\nThe Financial Samurai blog\u2019s Sam Dogen, the man behind the initial breakdown of the $350,000 salary, decided to use Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as an example of someone who could also encounter those same struggles.\n\n\u201cAs an unmarried, 30-year-old woman, what AOC might not realize is that she might very well turn into this family of four one day,\u201d Dogen wrote in a recent blog post. \u201cShe should prepare for a financial life in the Washington, D.C., area.\u201d\n\nAs a congresswoman making $174,000 a year, her earnings put her in the top 5% of Americans. Yet that money only goes so far when it comes to navigating one of the priciest ZIP Codes in the country, especially if she has kids.\n\nAssuming many things, including that AOC marries someone earning a similar income, Dogen came up with this budget:\n\nClearly, education is a killer, especially if Ocasio-Cortez takes the private school route that many of the area elite tend to choose. Add in the savings for Boston University, where she went to school, and the budget is pretty much blown.\n\nThere\u2019s simply not all that much fat to trim, but Dogen did offer five routes she could take to tackle these future problems.\n\n1) Be OK with public grade schools and university \u2014 This is by far the most obvious way to alleviate financial pressures, though, as Dogen points out, that might be a difficult, and unlikely, choice in her position of power.\n\n2) Do some side hustling \u2014 Members of Congress are permitted to earn outside income limited to no more than 15% of the annual rate of basic pay for level II of the Executive Schedule for federal employees, or $28,400.00 a year. That would bring her income up to $202,400, Dogen explained.\n\n3) Lose or quit \u2014 AOC can, and probably will, make a lot more money when she\u2019s out of Congress. A book deal alone could be worth millions.\n\n4) Find a wealthier spouse \u2014 Dogen points out that she runs in power circles where it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for prospective suitors to make millions. \u201cThe marriage combination of powerful politician plus wealthy business person is one of the most coveted status combinations in history,\u201d he said.\n\n5) Have fewer children \u2014 A big family rarely makes sense financially, but don\u2019t tell that to a couple trying to build one. \u201cIt should be a reasonable ask to not have children before first being able to take care of yourself,\u201d Dogen said. \u201cOur children deserve to be cared for in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez did not immediately return a request for comment, but don\u2019t be surprised if she chimes in from her Twitter feed.", "description": "The Financial Samurai blog\u2019s Sam Dogen, the man who caused a stir with his take on the money woes of six-figure earners, took a look at what Alexandria...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR275_AOC_ZG_20190913110002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
