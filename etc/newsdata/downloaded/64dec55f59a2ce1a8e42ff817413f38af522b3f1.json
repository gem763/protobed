He went into a classroom with the intent of killing himself, authorities said, not to kill other students.\n\nLowe, once a star wide receiver for the University of Oregon Ducks, said he was summoned to the fine arts building to get a student, according to prior media reports. The surveillance video revealed that Lowe and Granados-Diaz almost encountered each other in a hallway, KOIN 6 News reported.\n\n\u201cI walk in there, I get to the classroom, I\u2019m in the classroom for 15, 20 seconds \u2013 you know, I ask the teacher, \u2018Is the student here?\u2019\u201d Lowe said. In fact, Granados-Diaz was mere \u201csteps away\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe door opens \u2013 I\u2019m within arm\u2019s length of the door, about 3ft away from the door, and there\u2019s a kid with a gun, a shotgun. In a fraction of a second, I analyzed everything really fast.\n\n\u201cI saw the look in his face, look in his eyes, looked at the gun, realized it was a real gun and then my instincts just took over,\u201d Lowe also said. \u201cI lunged for the gun, put two hands on the gun. He had his two hands on the gun and obviously the kids are running out of the classroom and screaming.\u201d\n\nLowe handed the firearm to a teacher and embraced Granados-Diaz, who was then 18.\n\n\u201cI just held him and told him that I was there to save him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cI felt compassion for him; a lot of times, especially when you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing until it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nOn 10 October, Granados-Diaz pleaded guilty to two charges of having a loaded gun in public. The gun was purchased legally, Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) reported.\n\nProsecutors and Granados-Diaz\u2019s lawyer insisted the incident was not a potential school shooting. The student made a suicidal remark before the incident and was drunk upon arriving at Parkrose, his lawyer claimed.\n\n\u201cThe evidence he was at Parkrose high school to commit suicide is overwhelming,\u201d said defense attorney Adam Thayne. \u201cIt is also overwhelming that he was there to hurt himself and nobody else.\u201d\n\nGranados-Diaz did not open fire and only pointed the gun at himself. Under his plea agreement, he will be on probation for 36 months and undergo mental health and substance abuse treatment, OPB reported.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018hero\u2019 is the right word but the universe works in mysterious ways and I was meant to be in that classroom and I was meant to stop a tragedy,\u201d Lowe recalled.\n\nLowe, who is from the nearby city of Gresham, was employed as an offensive analyst for the San Francisco 49ers when he found out that his best friend had died from a drug overdose.\n\n\u201cThat shattered my whole life. That changed everything,\u2019 he said, according to Oregonlive.com. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going back.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cLife ain\u2019t about me, right? Life is about how I can help other people. So I came to help Parkrose. I came to change lives.\u201d", "description": "Surveillance footage reveals emotional moment when Keanon Lowe encountered armed student at Portland, Oregon, school", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b742bff8261f73ca575fdb3c58b6eb24c3c38e/519_332_1109_665/master/1109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2197279baf9ce1fe0484178e585e6733", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
