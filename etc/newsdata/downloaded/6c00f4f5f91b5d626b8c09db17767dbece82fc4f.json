But the move by the conservative-leaning company is still unexpected.\n\nAfter selling their current supply, all stores will discontinue sales of short-barrel rifle ammunition, as well as handgun ammunition, according to a statement. In Alaska, the stores will no longer sell handguns, ending the complete sale of handguns throughout the country.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWe know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand,\u201d the company\u2019s statement read. \u201cAs a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same.\u201d\n\nWalmart will also \u201crespectfully request\u201d that customers no longer carry firearms in their stores, citing especially customers doing so in a show of gun-powered strength.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
