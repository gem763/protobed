Investors are wary of its money losing business model; they are concerned about its losses and cash flow; and they are concerned about governance issues that concentrates sole power in Neumann's hands.\n\nWeWork's has seen its projected valuation cut from $47 billion to less than $20 billion due to a lack of interest from investors. And Softbank, WeWork's largest outside shareholder, has reportedly asked the company to delay its IPO.\n\nRead more: We got a peek at WeWork's top landlords. Here's who is most exposed to the fast-growing, but money-losing, coworking company as it prepares to IPO.\n\nWeWork has been working to address some of its governance concerns. It added a woman to its board and Neumann returned a controversial $5.9 million payment he was granted for use of the word \"we.\" But concerns still linger. The WeWork prospectus showed the company paid Neumann rent and lent him money, and that he has locked down voting control in the company.\n\nWeWork declined comment, citing its quiet period.\n\nRead more:", "description": "WeWork CEO Adam Neumann reportedly wants to wrap the roadshow and price the IPO before the two-day Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah.", "authors": ["Julie Bort"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d545f84cd9784401c38e5fd-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
