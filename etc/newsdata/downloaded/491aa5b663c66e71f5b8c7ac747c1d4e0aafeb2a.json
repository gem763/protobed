He adds, \u201cIran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nThe attacks come as Trump has held the door open for nuclear talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and as Iran restarted some uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear accord.\n\nPompeo says the U.S. calls on all nations to \u201ccondemn Iran\u2019s attacks.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cThe United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is blaming Iran for drone attacks Saturday against Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/Saudi_Arabia_44565.jpg-8743f_c67-0-3293-1881_s1770x1032.jpg?5a11f7910e1aec619bfc9bde9e4d5297f5f3da4a", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
