Sterling had a good run-up, but some investors are lightening their positions.\"\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.27% to $1.2756, pulling back from a five-month high of $1.2800 reached on Tuesday.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP=D3 , the British currency fell around 0.2% to 86.48 pence.

In the offshore market, the yuan CNH=D3 was off more than 0.2% to 7.0913 versus the dollar.\n\nA bruising trade war between the United States and China that has dragged on for more than a year has already placed incredible strain on relations between the two countries.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by months of often violent protests against China's rule of the former British colony.\n\nAny signs of support from U.S. lawmakers for the protest movement is likely to draw Beijing's ire and make a resolution to the trade war less likely. of a \"Phase 1\" trade deal between the United States and China last week initially cheered markets but the dearth of details around the agreement has since curbed any enthusiasm.\n\nThe yen rose slightly to 108.70 per dollar, pulling away from a two-month low.
