There are many sumptuous photographs of \u201cThe Greatest\u201d in the archives: him castigating the defeated Sonny Liston, dodging a haymaker from Joe Frazier and, of course, larking around whenever a camera or microphone was nearby. But this frame is different. It captures a youthful Clay in a moment of tranquility \u2013 perhaps lost in thought or concentration \u2013 his legacy yet to be written. Though Clay was felled by a sweet left hook by Cooper in the fourth round, he would recover to win the bout and went on to achieve unprecedented success in the ring, becoming heavyweight champion of the world three times. Through his refusal to fight in the Vietnam war and his staunch support of civil rights, he ultimately transcended sport itself and become an icon of the 20th century.\n\nPhotograph: Gerry Cranham/Offside\n\nWords: Jonny Weeks\n\nBuy your exclusive print here\n\nPrice\n\n\u00a355 including free delivery (28cm x 40cm print size) or \u00a3125 including free delivery (42cm x 59cm print size).\n\nPrints\n\nPhotographs are 27x40cm (unlimited run) or 42x59cm (limited run of 100 prints) and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.
