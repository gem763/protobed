It can be terminal \u2013 just ask Mitt Romney about health care or Nick Clegg about tuition fees \u2013 though sometimes politicians or the parties they represent can get away with it.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s refusal to commit to cutting migration if (when) he is appointed party leader follows a long \u2013 and very recent \u2013 history of supporting immigrants and championing their contribution to our economy and society. He hasn\u2019t betrayed the spirit of the referendum as Hunt protests: even the most ardent Leavers accept our departure must not represent a raising of the drawbridge to international talent.\n\nFor too long, increased caps on fees for international students, onerous regulations for the organisations that can endorse them to stay after graduating, and negative rhetoric have been a feature of our immigration policy. Our Job Creators study, released last week, strengthens the argument for scrapping the immigration target altogether and instead adopting a more open, forward-thinking approach.\n\nUsing analysis of SyndicateRoom\u2019s Top 100 list, which identifies those companies which have seen the largest increase in value over the past three years, Job Creators reveals that while just 14 per cent of the UK population are immigrants, half of our fastest-growing businesses have at least one foreign-born co-founder. Nine of the UK\u2019s 14 unicorns (startups with a valuation of $1bn or more) have at least one immigrant co-founder.", "description": "Political flip-flopping is so commonplace that it\u2019s a wonder manifestos are ever signed off or legislation passed.", "authors": ["Annabel Denham", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion", "Charles Moore", "Robert Buckland", "William Cook", "Rosa Prince", "Ross Clark"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/07/22/UCL_Overlay-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png", "published_at": "2019-07-22"}
