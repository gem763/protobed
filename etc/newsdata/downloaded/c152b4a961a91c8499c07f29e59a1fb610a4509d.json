While Smithley said he understands Busch\u2019s frustration, he insisted he did nothing wrong and chided Busch for not understanding the road Smithley has had to travel to get to where he is today as a race car driver.\n\n\u201cI figured given the events of the race Sunday I would quickly tell my story and defend myself (and the sport for that matter),\u201d Smithley tweeted Monday.\n\nMORE: Kyle Busch calls out \u2018guys who have never won late model races in Cup\u2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere\u2019s Smithley\u2019s tweet Monday, which we have transcribed in its entirety:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey everyone, I figured given the events of the race Sunday I would quickly tell my story and defend myself (and the sport for that matter). Starting tomorrow, we\u2019re focused on Richmond!\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in a racing family, and we certainly didn\u2019t have the funds to race. The only race car my parents ever bought was a used Bandolaro race car when I was 15. I didn\u2019t think I had a chance starting that late. We won enough that a local golf cart shop owner sponsored me and bought me a Legends car. I raced Legends cars in the southeast and won more races & championships.\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to move to Charlotte to pursue a career as a professional driver there is no doubt I had to basically give up the chance to win races in order to \u2018fund\u2019 getting the opportunity to race.\n\n\u201cYou see, I am one of only a handful of drivers that actually has never spent any of my own money to race. So spending money to go win in a late model was never an option, because the only way I can afford to race is if someone else pays for it. Companies & sponsors have a hard time justifying money to run a competitive late model or even truck, when for the same or often much less they can sponsor a NXS or Cup car. The truth is for many of these companies, they know unless they spend the money it takes to sponsor someone like Kyle, they more than likely will not get the marketing value to justify that spend. However, they can justify a spend to be involved in the \u2018big show\u2019 to entertain guest(s), etc., for much, much less. The sponsors you see on my cars, Victory Lane Quick Oil Change, Trophy Tractor, FAME \u2026 they are real companies supporting NASCAR, and seeing the value of its 65+ million fans. I sell my own sponsorship to afford me the opportunity to do this.\n\n\u201cSo about last night \u2026\n\n\u201c1. I am not mad at Kyle and I get his frustration. I wish that situation would\u2019ve turned out differently but what happened happened.\n\n\u201c2. Nobody that is considered \u2018in the way\u2019 wants to be. We are simply doing the best we can.\n\n\u201c3. Even though sometimes we ALL feel like this \u2018sucks\u2019 so bad or why won\u2019t NASCAR \u2018fix\u2019 it, we have to remember, it\u2019s not that easy. NASCAR is making positive changes but this is a multi-billion-dollar industry. It all takes time.\n\n\u201c4. I do think I can be competitive in the right equipment and I will even go a step further and say, with time and equal funding my teams with Rick Ware Racing, Johnny Davis Motorsports can be competitive too.\n\n\u201c5. As my friend Ross would say, \u2018The Sun will come up in the morning!\n\n\u201cThanks for all the support \u2013 Garrett.\u201d\n\nAs of 7:35 p.m. ET, Busch had not replied to Smithley\u2019s latest missive.\n\nOn Monday\u2019s edition of NASCAR America, analysts Kyle Petty, Steve Letarte and Nate Ryan discussed Busch\u2019s reaction to the Smithley incident.\n\nHere are a couple of the initial exchanges between Smithley and Busch after Sunday\u2019s race:\n\nHeld my line\u20262 cars got around \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/pZCRb4uFay \u2014 Garrett Smithley (@GarrettSmithley) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nI was told to run middle so that\u2019s where i was committed.
