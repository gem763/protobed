The controversy is fueled in great part by the compassion-driven emotionalism of well-meaning Americans, she writes, but the ultimate motives of those causing the controversy are financial gain.\n\nSilicon Valley does and expects to continue to profit from the work of illegal aliens, refugees and low-wage workers. As religion continues to lose purchase among newer generations, church leaders need their churches fuller, and with more money in the collection boxes. Politicians want cheap votes, cheap labor, and many see unlimited immigration as the best solution to shrinking constituencies. And then there are the social justice warriors who feast on the great sums to be made just by encouraging good-hearted but gullible citizens to pony up for poor abused would-be-immigrants.\n\nAt the top of Ms. Malkin\u2019s list of those who encourage people to part with their money for open border purposes \u2014 demonstrations, caravans, well-publicized defiance of all immigration officials \u2014 are George Soros, George Clooney, Tim Cook and Pope Francis.\n\nAs a life-long Catholic, it no doubt troubles Ms. Malkin to call the activities of the leader of her church into question. But the pope has taken public stands on immigration that oppose our written laws and are antithetical to the orderly legal processes that structure our nation. Nor is it a secret that the pope and George Soros have common interests, support certain overlapping organizations and share a distaste for this country\u2019s current leader.\n\nMs. Malkin puts it much more directly: \u201cGlobalists are doing everything in their power to deny President Trump reelection in 2020. The caravan cartel hates him. George Soros, the Pope, and the United Nations consider him an evil threat to their billion-dollar migration and refugee enterprises. Antifa wants him dead. The Southern Poverty Law Center and Silicon Valley want to purge every last one of his supporters from the public square.\u201d\n\nMuch of Ms. Malkin\u2019s bill of particulars is summarized in her chapter headings: \u201cSin Fronteras: All Aboard The Caravan Cartel\u201d; \u201cGeorge Soros: The CEO of Open Borders\u201d; \u201cUnholy Alliance: The Pope, Catholic Bishops, And Amnesty Profiteers\u201d; \u201cWretched Refuse: The Refugee Resettlement Racket\u201d; \u201cHate Machine: The Southern Poverty Law Center\u201d; \u201cHollywood or Hollywall?: Inside the Fortress of Celebrity Hypocrisy\u201d; and \u201cFact Check: True, the Liberal Media Hates America.\u201d In a concluding chapter, \u201cBorder Defenders\u2019 Action Plan,\u201d she suggests ways in which individual Americans can take a hand in the struggle against open-border crusaders. One is to use \u201cthe power of our own purses to ensure that we are not subsidizing our own worst enemies.\u201d As one example, she writes, \u201cI refuse to put my hard-earned money in collection baskets whose contents will end up in the hands of Trump-deranged Marxists.\u201d\n\nShe recommends a selective boycott of the entertainment industry, and calls on \u201cgrassroots conservatives, independents, and patriots of any political ideology [to] send a message to the cheap vote/cheap labor lobby in Washington: American lives matter and American jobs matter. If Beltway swamp creatures won\u2019t put their votes where their mouths are, stop putting your money in their grubby, duplicitous hands.\u201d\n\nShe concludes the chapter with a list of suggestions, and provides throughout the book information that allows readers to do their own due diligence with religious institutions and charities. She has also included appendices and maps tracing tens of millions of dollars spent and received by more than 400 charities, lobbying groups and legal organizations promoting mass immigration. Moreover, as an accomplished journalist, she folds the hard information seamlessly into the text, with no dilution of narrative energy.\n\nPerhaps the single best summary of Ms. Malkin\u2019s book comes from Gavin McInnes, co-founder of Vice, who calls it \u201ca veritable fireball of finely tuned arguments that beautifully counter the new wave of anti-Americanism.\u201d\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F. Buckley Jr. and the American Conservative Movement\u201d (Wiley).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nOPEN BORDERS INC.: WHO\u2019S FUNDING AMERICA\u2019S DESTRUCTION?\n\nBy Michelle Malkin\n\nRegnery Publishing, $28.99, 468 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
