REUTERS/Aziz Taher\n\nLebanon also plans to keep the local currency peg to the dollar which was crucial to move ahead with long-stalled reforms, Hariri told CNBC in an interview.\n\nLebanon faces another credit rating downgrade and a potential test of its currency peg if the depletion of its limited foreign exchange reserves accelerates, S&P Global warned on Wednesday.\n\nHariri said the challenge was to prevent a further deterioration in Lebanon\u2019s public debt burden, which is one of the heaviest in the world at around 150% of GDP. \u201cOur strategy is to stabilize the problem that we have. Most important thing is not to deteriorate more, right?\u201d he said.\n\nWith Lebanon suffering from years of low economic growth, long-stalled reforms are seen as more pressing than ever to put the state finances on a sustainable path.\n\nOn Monday, Lebanon declared a \u201cstate of economic emergency\u201d, with Hariri saying the government would take emergency measures to speed up economic reforms to help overcome a worsening crisis.\n\nHariri said after a gathering of senior politicians and ministers that accelerating reforms would avoid a scenario similar to Greece, which fell into a debt crisis nine years ago and had to adopt tough austerity measures under tight supervision by foreign creditors.\n\nEconomists and politicians say the big budget deficits over the years have been rooted in waste, corruption, and sectarian politics.\n\n\u201cSo what we are doing is, fixing our debt to GDP, our deficit and the budget to 7.6% this year, we want to go down to 7% next year, or maybe a little bit less,\u201d he said in the interview aired on Wednesday.\n\nThe IMF said in July the deficit in 2019 would likely be well above the government\u2019s target of 7.6% of national output.\n\nFitch downgraded Lebanon\u2019s credit rating to CCC on debt-servicing concerns last month.\n\nMAINTAIN POUND PEG TO DOLLAR\n\nThe prime minister also said that \u201ckeeping the Lebanese pound at 1,500\u201d is the only stable way to proceed with the government\u2019s reforms.\n\nThe Lebanese pound has been pegged against the U.S. dollar at its current level for more than two decades and is seen as a cornerstone of the country\u2019s financial stability.\n\nHariri said his country would not consider an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program since it would leave market forces to decide the pricing of the country\u2019s currency.\n\n\u201cI think the IMF has certain criteria that we do not, especially when it comes to the Lebanese pound. This is something that we feel extremely sensitive about.\u201d\n\nHariri said divergent views on exchange rate policy was the only difference the government had with the IMF. The government had been in consultations with the IMF over tackling the country\u2019s economic and fiscal woes.\n\nLebanon had no need to enter any program with the IMF since it already had an ambitious structural reform plan with donors that will help bring investments and spur growth, Hariri said.\n\nForeign governments and donor institutions last year pledged $11 billion in financing to Lebanon for a 12-year infrastructure investment program at a conference in Paris, on condition that it carries out reforms.", "description": "Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said his government would aim to cut the budget deficit to 7% of GDP next year as part of reforms to bring public finances under control and rein in public debt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426025643&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830F4"}
