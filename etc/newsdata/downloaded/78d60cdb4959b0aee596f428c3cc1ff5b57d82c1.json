Photo: Vulture/Warner Bros/null\n\nWhat does it take to be a costume designer in Hollywood? \u201cYou need to be a therapist, and you need a therapist,\u201d jokes Lou Eyrich, Ryan Murphy\u2019s go-to when it comes to the wardrobe department. She and her ilk are sterling multitaskers who juggle the needs of all sorts of personalities on set. They work with directors and showrunners to make sure the costumes they\u2019re creating are in sync with grander visions of characters, settings, and stories. They collaborate closely with stars to make sure the costumes fit, both physically and with an actor\u2019s idea of the role. They communicate with heads of other departments \u2014 hair, makeup, production design \u2014 to verify that the clothes gel within the broader palette of a scene. They\u2019ve always wrangled extras and closet space, but these days they interface with animators and CGI artists, too.\n\nAccording to several costume designers who spoke to Vulture, the already significant demands on their field have risen in recent years, particularly as the ambitions of motion pictures leak into prestige TV. As the production value being sought lurches upward, costume designers working in television find themselves facing shorter preparation periods and longer hours \u2014 but not necessarily better pay. \u201cThe studios get away with this because TV has historically paid less than film,\u201d says Salvador Perez, a designer who frequently works with Mindy Kaling and is president of the Costume Designers Guild\u2019s board of directors. \u201cBut as TV shows are getting grander in scale and the studios want to attract feature-film costume designers, they are starting to pay feature rates to get notable costume designers to work on TV shows. TV rates are starting to rise, and we are working to make this the industry standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to address it,\u201d adds Cynthia Summers, an Emmy nominee this year for her costume work on Netflix\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events. \u201cWe need people to be paid for what they\u2019re doing and for their work, and producers, they need to step up to that, I think. Some of them are, which is fantastic and so appreciated. Some of them are not. It\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, costume designers continue to provide a wide array of services to both makers of film and TV. Here, some stories about those challenges.\n\nBlack Panther, the Dora Milaje costumes\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios\n\nRuth E. Carter (numerous Spike Lee movies, Selma, the upcoming Coming 2 America): The challenges I faced on Black Panther were the biggest challenges I think that I\u2019ve encountered in my career in a long, long time. One was to create the Dora costume as authentically as possible to [reflect] ancient African history by using leather and bead work and metalwork [and] coming up with a way that we could do the neck ring and the arm ring that were wearable. Because the ancient African technique of wearing the neck rings \u2014 they were something that was put on you as an infant, and you lived with these rings on your neck and added to them so they became a part of your skin and your structure. But we\u2019re making a movie. We still want these rings to have that seamless, bent, and twisted appearance but, at the end of the day, [allow the actors to] take them off and go home.\n\nWe made them out of plastic tubes that we painted gold or silver, and we attached them with magnets. But that was very difficult to manage because of the amount of physical activity that was happening on set, so you know, a little gaffer\u2019s tape during the filming went a long way. They came apart a lot, and you don\u2019t have time to stop the action and go back to the workshop. You just had to take the gaffer\u2019s tape, tape it on the back, and let the postproduction help you out with a little movie magic. Technology has allowed us to be much more authentic than I think we could when we had a special piece that was vintage or antique and we only had one. Because in this business, one is none. You have to have multiples of everything, and technology has allowed us to take all the aspects of that special piece and print it.\n\nWe based Queen Ramonda\u2019s crown off of an existing Zulu married woman\u2019s hat called an isicholo. The isicholo was scanned, so it had the same weave pattern as the actual weavers who make it, and then we printed it out. So when you see her hat, it\u2019s 3-D printed, it\u2019s not woven. It\u2019s perfect, because it\u2019s cylindrical and it has the same style lines as the weave pattern of the original hat.\n\n[In Hollywood now], we have shorter amounts of time and prep and we have less money and 3-D printing is very expensive. So you have to be very clear about what you\u2019re making, and you go through the steps very carefully. Hopefully, maybe ten years, 20 years from now, every department will have their own 3-D printer and scanner and we\u2019ll be able to do it in-house for pennies on the dollar.\n\nBurn After Reading, George Clooney\u2019s and Tilda Swinton\u2019s entire wardrobes\n\nPhoto: Focus Features\n\nAmy Roth (Madam Secretary, The Looming Tower, the forthcoming film Motherless Brooklyn): I was assisting Mary Zophres, and we were doing Burn After Reading with the Coen brothers. She called me out of the blue, and she said, \u201cI really need your help. Can you come with me to Scotland and Italy to fit George Clooney and Tilda Swinton?\u201d I said, \u201cAre you kidding me? Yes.\u201d\n\nWe only had one fitting with each actor, and they had multiple changes throughout the film. So I just kept loading up boxes of great things from wonderful stores for them to wear, and Mary was doing the same on the West Coast. We met in the airport, I believe, in Scotland, with more boxes than you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nWe go into Tilda\u2019s house and, there\u2019s no closets there, because she\u2019s in this 18th-century home that has no closets. So we\u2019re laying things all over the place. There\u2019s no organization. Anyway, I got a hernia. I was in so much pain, and I was nauseous beyond belief, and people kept wanting to give us food. Her husband at the time was John Byrne, this really handsome man, who was making us beans and coffee. Imagine: somebody with a hernia. Then we had to put everything back on the truck and drive out of Scotland, back to the airport, put it on a little plane, fly to Milan, get a people-mover bus, with all of our costumes. The whole time you\u2019re thinking: I wanted to do this.\n\nAnyway, we get to George [in Italy]. Now I\u2019m having acid reflux, off-the-chart bad. And he apparently had lost all this weight because he had an injury on Syriana, so none of the clothes that we brought fit him. We had this four-hour fitting of trying to take what we had and kind of mold it to his 20-pound-less body. The saddest part was, I wanted to have fun, because he sat down on the bed and he started talking about Obama, who was running for president at the time, and he was telling us how he\u2019s really the real deal. All I kept thinking is, I\u2019m going to throw up on George Clooney, on this bed. I\u2019m going to throw up on George Clooney. It was the worst day of my life, and it should have been the best. That is, like, show business to me. The truth is it\u2019s just always a lot of hard work, and there is no glam.\n\nMad Men, Betty Draper\u2019s black-and-pink dress\n\nJanie Bryant (Deadwood, It, Why Women Kill): Mad Men in those days, especially season one, the prep time was just so much shorter. We literally had three to four days to prep an episode. I remember that my supervisor did the costume breakdown [on one episode, \u201cShoot\u201d] and January Jones, who plays Betty Draper, had 14 costume changes. We have two days to prep it. I was like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only Betty, right? It\u2019s the rest of the principal cast, it\u2019s the day players. It\u2019s the children. Add in 200 extras. Everybody has to be costumed head to toe. That episode I will never forget. I had to remake a vintage dress for Betty. The black-and-pink strapless 1950s dress that she wears in the audition at the beginning of the episode \u2014 that was just a solid plain black strapless dress. Then I had it rebuilt with the bow across the top, at the bodice, and then adding all of the pink godets in the skirt. Matt [Weiner] and I had talked about the scene, and what he really wanted to convey was that Betty used to be a model and that she\u2019s too old to be a model. Her style when she was a model is out of fashion now. So a 1950s dress was perfect for that scene.\n\nIt\u2019s so funny. Betty\u2019s pink-and-black dress: Because we had rented it, and I had rebuilt it at the shop, it ended up back at Western Costume, because we had to return it at the end of the season, right? At the end of every year, Western Costume will have a huge costume sale, where they sell things \u2014 maybe they\u2019re too damaged, or too old, or there\u2019s a whole bunch of different reasons why they sell off some of their stock. Somehow Betty\u2019s dress got put in the annual Western sale. Long story short, a couple of years later, I was fitting Aaron Stanton, who played one of the boys in the office, Ken, starts telling me about his friend\u2019s wife who ended up buying Betty\u2019s dress from the Western sale. She actually wore it to a book signing that I had at Playclothes. Then I actually contacted her later \u2014 because Mad Men costumes, some of them were in different museums. So we contacted her to say, \u201cCould we borrow Betty\u2019s dress?\u201d And she refused us. She said, \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m not letting this dress out of my hands.\u201d\n\nHobbs & Shaw, Idris Elba\u2019s super-suits\n\nPhoto: Universal Pictures\n\nSarah Evelyn (Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbes & Shaw, American Horror Story: Cult, Ryan Murphy\u2019s forthcoming Hollywood): My last project, Hobbes & Shaw \u2014 there were a lot of challenges on that. Really, the most challenging thing was Idris [Elba\u2019s] super-suits: What were we going to do that was going to work within the world of our movie, and work on Idris, and not all of the sudden be a superhero suit, which we didn\u2019t even have the budget for?\n\nIdris didn\u2019t roll in until really late, so I already had to have it basically completely conceptualized, figure out exactly how I was going to get it made and show it to him as, essentially, a completed suit. We had his measurements. It was actually built onto a body form. We found another show he was on, we got his measurements, then we flew our shopper to wherever he was and a body scanner who scanned his body, and then made a 3-D mold of him. Then we worked off the 3-D mold, which is actually becoming more and more common because availability of big actors is becoming more and more scarce. So if you can\u2019t get people in for a fitting, what are you going to do?\n\nIt was incredibly nerve-wracking when he tried it on. I mean, lucky for me, Idris just walks into clothing and looks amazing. He just does clothing favors. He\u2019s the kind of guy who can put anything on and it looks good. But the question was, is he going to feel like this is what his character is? Is he going to be down with it? Because that\u2019s really important. And he was, thankfully.\n\nThe second challenge was he needed multiples, and not only did he need multiples but the stunt guys were wearing it, too. So they needed multiples that we could destroy. Every time you need multiples, you need to think about that in your design. Is this going to rip? And then when it does rip, you need to be ready to act on a dime, because inevitably, something got sewn with some rotten thread or, especially because [director] David Leitch is just so amazing with stunts and is such a creative guy, of course you\u2019re doing some stunt you didn\u2019t consider. So then the pants rip and then the second pair of pants rip and then the third pair of pants rip and then the knee rips up and now you\u2019re down pants. It\u2019s just all hands on deck, getting pants put back together. Those are incredibly, incredibly challenging moments.\n\nAlice in Wonderland, a CGI Red Queen\u2019s neck line\n\nPhoto: Walt Disney Pictures\n\nColleen Atwood (nearly every movie Tim Burton has directed, Chicago, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the forthcoming live-action Little Mermaid): When I did the first Alice in Wonderland, it was the first time I\u2019d really dealt with the digital language that has become a huge part of filmmaking. I was approaching it with some trepidation and a little bit of fear, and it ended up a really exciting and interesting prospect to me, which, as a costume designer, kind of opened up a whole new realm of possibility.\n\nThe challenges were specifically trying to make clothes that did the work with, for instance, the Red Queen: figuring out neck lines and different lines on her costume that could look kind of close to the same if they changed her head size [with effects]. You bring the sides of the collar up against the neck so it can make the neck not get so huge when [the effects artists] make the head huge. The shape of the waist and where it was dropped a little bit to allow proportion with the giant head.\n\nYou do your work, you give it to [visual effects], and look at what they manipulate, and then after they do that, you look at it and adjust the actual physical costume to give it the optimum performance for what they want and still have it work in the room on a human body. The things that you need for a period or fantasy movie, if you don\u2019t have it around you \u2014 if you can\u2019t feel it \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult for the actors. I mean, people have great skills, but you run around in a green unitard pretending you\u2019re a queen in a huge gown? It\u2019s a stretch. I think the two together [CGI and practical costumes] is the ideal world, not just one or the other.\n\nA Series of Unfortunate Events, Detective Dupin\u2019s hat\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Cynthia Summers\n\nCynthia Summers (UnREAL, Altered Carbon, upcoming TV adaptation of Snowpiercer): The hardest [costume] I want to say, from the two seasons [of A Series of Unfortunate Events] that I did was Count Olaf as Detective Dupin. People asked me, \u201cWell, where is the illustration for that?\u201d And the reason that there isn\u2019t one is we basically came up with the concept for that costume five days before camera.\n\nHe had to be in disguises as this scat-singing, sleazy detective. I started with the great jazz singers of the \u201950s and \u201960s, but it really wasn\u2019t that. There\u2019s a little bit of that in there for sure, but it really wasn\u2019t specifically that. And then we went Elvis in his Vegas \u201970s phase. But nothing was working. It felt too contrived, and not right, especially compared to all the other disguises. So we just went to the \u201970s, kind of the disco era, and then took some things from that.\n\nWe made the jacket, the shirts, the pants. We purchased the hat, because we didn\u2019t have time to have that straw hat made, but we painted the hat so it was the right color of gray and distressed it and broke it down. [Neil Patrick Harris] brought the Jason Mraz hat to the table and [suggested wearing a hat like] how Jason wears a hat. Those small details being brought to me by someone else are what helped me turn something maybe ordinary in the scope of Lemony Snicket to something really kind of amazing.\n\nI had 20 minutes to try on his costume before he worked in it that day. That means me, my tailor, a seamstress or a seamster, and my breakdown artist standing on set with her pots of paint and our needles and thread in case we had to do a last-minute whatever before he went to camera. Yeah, it was one of my scariest but most gratifying moments on the series.\n\nScandal, Olivia Pope\u2019s vintage black-tie gown\n\nPhoto: ABC\n\nLyn Paolo (The West Wing, Shameless, the forthcoming Little Fires Everywhere): On the second season of Scandal, Olivia Pope was going out to this amazing big black-tie affair. We had all this press on the show by then. A lot of it was about her fashion. We did struggle to find the perfect dress for her, and I ended up doing maybe eight or ten sketches, like, What do we want her to look like? You have such a short time span to get it all together.\n\nWe ended up literally finding an old, vintage Jean Fares dress that was in a box at a PR company, and it was shredded. The silk chiffon was gone. It was just dead. But it just had something intrinsically beautiful about how it was constructed internally and also the beading, which I don\u2019t think \u2014 maybe you could find it now, but it would be a struggle.\n\nThat dress was \u2026 first of all, it was a risk to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go with something that\u2019s falling to pieces, and we\u2019re going to remake it and restructure it.\u201d We had to replace all of that chiffon and remake whole sections of the bodice. In a four-day timeline. And also the thing itself was quite expensive to buy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to say [how much it cost]. I called [the production] and said, \u201cLook, we\u2019re not finding it. We\u2019re just going to do this.\u201d Mary Howard, who is our producer and who I still work with to this day, said, \u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s a lot.\u201d She said, \u201cIs it going to be worth it?\u201d And I said, \u201cI think it is.\u201d\n\nGod bless Shonda Rhimes and [producer] Betsy Beers, because they said, \u201cWe trust you and it\u2019s going to be great and we know you\u2019re going to make this work.\u201d They supported me and we made that dress and it\u2019s one of the most, I think, iconic looks from the show. On the day, God bless Betsy Beers, she came down to the set to see it. She just turned to me and said, \u201c[Kerry Washington] looks fantastic.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOkay, good.\u201d\n\nSorry to Bother You, Tessa Thompson\u2019s custom suit\n\nPhoto: Annapurna\n\nDeirdra Govan (The Sun Is Also a Star, BET\u2019s The First Wives Club, the forthcoming new season of The L Word): Sorry to Bother You \u2014 that was an out-of-the-box unique project because it had its own specific challenges, in terms of being an independent project. We had very little money.\n\nFor the characters of Detroit [Tessa Thompson] and Cassius [Lakeith Stanfield], a lot of their clothing was from vintage stores. There would be some things that I\u2019d modify for Detroit. She had one flight suit that she wore in her gallery scene, and that was just a plain, beige flight suit. But I said, okay, well, how does this speak to her character? It\u2019s not just a flight suit. I have this thing where I really love working with fabric, and painting, and taking clothes apart, and reworking them into something completely new. It\u2019s how I was trained. But with her clothing specifically, it needed to match her.\n\nThe director [Boots Riley] had a friend who was a painter. I was running out of time, so the director said, \u201cHey, he\u2019s going to be painting some of the artwork in the gallery scene. Why don\u2019t you ask him if he could take a look at some of the pieces of clothing, and tell him what you want, and he\u2019ll do it?\u201d So I reached out to him, and he did it. Not only was his artwork featured on the wall, he was able to also use his hand to paint Detroit\u2019s jumpsuit. To me, that\u2019s the use of resources \u2014 meaning time, meaning budget, all of which were very limited.\n\nNever Have I Ever; 150 sarees, jutes, and lehengas\n\nSalvador Perez (Party Down, the Pitch Perfect movies, The Mindy Project): I\u2019m doing Mindy\u2019s new show called Never Have I Ever. Mindy writes that they\u2019re going to an Indian Ganesh Puja ceremony, which is a holy ceremony and everybody goes in Indian dress. That was a bit of a challenge because you have six to seven days to pull off 150 people in full Indian dress. Sarees, jutes, lehengas. Luckily, I\u2019ve done sarees my whole career and with Mindy for the last eight years. You know, you\u2019re trying to make people look individual but also part of the group \u2014 and you overbuy. So when you have to dress 150 people, you buy 250 outfits, and they have to be head to toe, jewelry, shoes, and all.\n\nAnd they have to be individual. It has to look like individual people bought them, and you didn\u2019t just go to the store and get the red one, the purple one, the green one.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen somebody wrap a saree, it\u2019s tricky. Normally, you wrap a saree, and if it falls down \u2014 you know, you just fix it all day long. Well, we\u2019re having to have continuity, and we shoot this over four days, across two weeks, so we had to rig the sarees so that they look like they were hand-wrapped, but they weren\u2019t. There\u2019s a way you wrap a saree, and \u2026 you fold it, pleat it, and tuck it in. We painstakingly measure that out so the pleats are sewn together and then where the thing wraps around you, we mark all the wrap points and we put snaps on it. It\u2019s completely engineered.\n\nThe beauty of a saree is how it\u2019s wrapped and folded on you, and Indian women who do it \u2014 we had an Indian actress who had wrapped herself. It was beautiful, but once they wrapped it, then we had to go in and safety-pin it and tag it in place. There\u2019s an artistry to how they\u2019re folded. I brought in six people to help wrap sarees \u2014 two Indian women, and then costumers \u2014 because I wrap the saree in a very particular way. But if I wrapped every woman, they would look exactly the same. So we brought in several different people. Then the same people that wrapped the first time had to wrap the second time because they had to maintain the continuity.\n\nWhen we finally got it all on-set \u2014 it\u2019s episode three of the show \u2014 it\u2019s glorious on-camera, And it looks seamless. It looks like, Oh, they just brought their own clothes. And it\u2019s like, no, I dressed every single one of them.\n\nUnnamed Production, a pinstriped ensemble for a famous actor\n\nMona May (Clueless, Enchanted, Santa Clarita Diet): We were in the final preparations to shoot this film, and this one particular costume was made \u2014 it was a pinstriped suit for this one famous actor.\n\nI made the suit. The fabric was purchased from South Africa with some beautiful wool that we had, that [the actor] approved, and the director approved. Here\u2019s the final fitting, it\u2019s 6 p.m. We are shooting that particular scene with the suit the next morning; it will be a 5 a.m. call, so this is the final rehearsal. The actress comes into the fitting room, we try this suit on, and she looks at it and decides that she hates the suit because the pinstripe on the fabric is too wide. The pinstripe is making her look fat.\n\nNow, the fabric store is basically closing in an hour. I have to call the fabric store, hope to God that there\u2019s a different pinstriped fabric available. I have to call my seamstress, alert her that now she has to make a suit overnight. We hold this store open. I drive there as fast as I can. Thanks to God there was some type of beautiful wool where the pinstripe was a little less wide. We buy the fabric, I go to the seamstress. She stays up pretty much all night. We go pick it up at 4:30 in the morning, deliver the suit to the set for 5 a.m. call. And, luckily, it was accepted and we were able to shoot. But it was the most nerve-wracking night of my life, pretty much. This is not just making a cute little skirt or something. This is real tailoring. And we pulled it off.\n\n[The actor] just had a lot of power at that moment in her career, and that was that. There was no one that I could go to, producer, director. They just said: \u201cDo it. If that\u2019s what she wants, do it.\u201d So, this is one of those stories that really tells you that it\u2019s also living on the whim of the actor, sometimes. We try to accommodate all their wishes and make them feel comfortable, because our job is to give them everything they want, 100 percent, when they walk on set.\n\nUnnamed Productions, moth-eaten clothing from the 1940s\n\nLou Eyrich (just about every Ryan Murphy series, including Glee, American Horror Story, Pose, and the upcoming Ratched): Ten years ago there were 40 shows [total] and now there\u2019s over 400 because of the streaming possibilities. Absolutely the costume houses can\u2019t keep up with the demand. Right now I\u2019m working on \u201940s [clothes]. And there\u2019s four other shows going \u201940s, and it\u2019s really trying. So we\u2019re just having to make a lot of it, but it\u2019s always a trick so that things don\u2019t look made to order or homemade. I mean, I have really good tailors so they never look homemade. But it\u2019s finding the fabrics. It\u2019s all about the fabric. If it doesn\u2019t have the right drape, it\u2019s not going to look right.\n\n\u201940s clothes are falling apart because they\u2019re old, and they\u2019re moth-eaten, shoulder burned. Also, our bodies are different now than they were in the \u201940s. Our body shapes have shifted. Women are much taller. There are very few period shoes bigger than an eight. So there are definitely some really good shoe companies who are doing repros, but now all of us period shows are shopping from the same shoe stores. We paint them and we age them and we make them look different. There are certain vendors we all shop from, and they\u2019re madly trying to pick more up.\n\nFor any other designers who have a great hardest costume story to share, let us know at stories@vulture.com.", "description": "11 costume designers on meeting the excruciating demands of Hollywood on the sets of Black Panther, Mad Men, Scandal, Sorry to Bother You, Hobbes & Shaw, Alice in Wonderland, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and more.", "authors": ["Jen Chaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/09/how-it-works/09-how-it-works-costumes.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
