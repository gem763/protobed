It's no wonder the International Monetary Fund, among others, revised down its projection for global economic growth to the lowest level since the global financial crisis. I worry that even these latest revisions may not be enough to capture the drag from the slowdown in Europe and elsewhere in the world.\n\nA better explanation for the restoration of the US yield curve can be found in the evolving market perceptions of future central bank policies, in the US and abroad.\n\nDespite the weak global economic outlook, a growing set of signals has been coming out of central banks suggesting waning enthusiasm and appetite for the continued use of unconventional measures such as negative interest rates and large-scale bond purchases. Such easing is viewed as having limited, if any, sustainable benefits for economic activity.\n\nAlso, it is fuelling growing concerns about the risk of future financial instability, economy-wide resource misallocations, and contrarian behaviours by those worried about their ability to secure their future economic security, including higher savings driven by an uptick in risk aversion and the threat to long-term financial protection products such as low-risk retirement planning and life insurance.\n\nSuch central bank signals include the loud and vocal public opposition by some current and former ECB officials to further policy easing and media reports suggesting a leaner appetite among the traditionally more dovish and centrist Fed officials for significantly lower interest rates. That can also explain why so many Fed officials who have been forced to resume a security-buying program in response to dislocations in the wholesale funding market have gone out of their way to repeatedly echo chairman Jerome Powell's words that \"in no sense is this QE\".\n\nThe more that markets internalise this shifting monetary policy sentiment inside central banks, the more that they will unwind the policy expectations that fuelled several forces acting to invert the US yield curve, including indirect ones such as the enormous pressure on foreign investors to flee negative yields in Europe and Japan and go into longer-dated US bonds.\n\nLook for this phenomenon to also maintain the yield spread between German and US bonds at its current lower range despite what will continue to be relative economic outperformance by the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I argued in March that it was unwise to react to the inversion of the Treasury yield curve with extreme anxiety about a US recession, it would be premature to celebrate the recent partial reversion as an indicator of significant strengthening of US economic prospects.\n\nInstead, both are reminders of the extent to which traditional economic signals have been distorted by a prolonged period of extraordinary central bank policies.\n\nAnd they should also been seen as just one of the unusual consequences of a monetary stance that, imposed for several years on central banks by the lack of proper policy action elsewhere, will now see the hoped-for benefits give way to a broadening and deepening recognition of the unintended consequences and collateral risks.\n\nMohamed A.
