On a quarterly earnings call in 2016, FedEx estimated that itself, UPS, and USPS executed a whopping 95% of all e-commerce orders.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nBut rapidly rising volumes have put the pair of legacy shippers in a bind. E-commerce sales have risen over 50% since 2014 and are projected to continue their ascent into the next decade. High volumes are already straining shippers' networks \u2014 UPS struggled to bring consumers their parcels on time due to higher-than-anticipated package volume, which upset some big-name retail partners, including Macy's, Walmart, and Amazon. As online sales surge further, package volumes will outstrip legacy shippers' capacities, creating space for new entrants.\n\nAmazon presents the biggest near-term threat to UPS and FedEx's duopoly due to its size, strategic position in the e-commerce market, and wealth of logistics infrastructure. DHL is reentering the market after a 10-year absence, but it still has dozens of warehouses across the US that it can utilize to support its delivery network. The company also recently spent millions to update its warehouses, which will help it quickly get parcels in and out the door. And ride-hailing giant Uber \u2014 which unsuccessfully tried to offer a last-mile service known as UberRush \u2014 is a threat to UPS and FedEx if it can learn from the mistakes it made with Rush. Lastly, crowdsourced delivery startup Postmates, which operates a similar model to Uber, but for deliveries, could threaten UPS and FedEx if it can tackle the challenge of handling grocery and parcel deliveries.\n\nIn The Delivery Challenger Report, Business Insider Intelligence identifies the four companies that pose the largest threats to UPS and FedEx's duopoly in the US last-mile delivery market. We then unpack the strengths each of these players could bring to the last-mile delivery space. Lastly, we outline concrete steps each of them must take if they hope to maximize their footprint in the market and peel away business from UPS and FedEx.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report include: Alibaba, Amazon, Deliv, DHL, FedEx, Postmates, Uber, UPS, USPS, and Postmates.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nThe rapid surge in online retail sales is creating significantly more volume than UPS and FedEx can handle. Last holiday season, for instance, UPS dealt with shipping delays in its network, upsetting several high-volume retailers.\n\nAmazon, DHL, Uber, and Postmates are best positioned to step in and swallow up this excess volume, ultimately threatening the duopoly.\n\nAmazon, Uber, and Postmates need to expand their crowdsourced delivery offerings since they require lower labor costs than FedEx's and UPS's operating models.\n\nFor Amazon, in particular, that must involve offering merchant partners lower shipping rates than UPS and FedEx \u2014 one-third of US online retailers would consider switching to an Amazon delivery service if it offered at least 20% lower shipping rates.", "description": "In a 2019 report, Business Insider Intelligence identifies the four companies that pose the largest threats to UPS and FedEx's duopoly.", "authors": ["Nicholas Shields"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c08436a0e2bf80ab73f97ad-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-05"}
