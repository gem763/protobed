On Saturday afternoon, Wall Street\u2019s long-suffering \u201cCharging Bull\u201d endured yet another attack that left it with a six-inch-long gash above its brow, along with a dozen deep scratches. The alleged culprit? A Texas man wielding a fortified metal banjo.\n\nTevon Varlack, 42, of Dallas was charged with criminal mischief and disorderly conduct on Saturday in connection with the vandalism.\n\nA witness told the New York Times that Varlack was cursing President Trump as he swung the banjo against the bronze sculpture, sending loud clanging through the Bowling Green park in Manhattan\u2019s financial district and startling tourists hoping for a photo with the bull\u2019s famous gonads. Police declined to confirm this, writing only that the man responsible for the attack was \u201cranting incoherently.\u201d\n\nArturo Di Modica, the Sicilian artist behind the sculpture, told the New York Post that he thinks Varlack acted out of a desire for attention. \u201cThe guy wanted publicity and he did it for publicity,\u201d the artist said. \u201cHe knew he was going to be arrested and he knew he was going to be in the paper.\"\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed Sunday, Varlack was playing loud music from a portable speaker while hacking at the statue. When an officer picked up the \u201cmetal imitation banjo,\u201d Varlack reportedly said, \u201cI did it. The banjo and speaker are mine.\"\n\nFernando Luis Alvarez, a gallery manager who works with Di Modica, told the Times that repairs could cost between $75,000 and $150,000.\n\nBREAKING: Photos show man as he defaced iconic charging bull statue in Financial District. @PIX11News #NewYork #NYC pic.twitter.com/iIzQ9tVQVs \u2014 Cristian Benavides (@cbenavidesTV) September 7, 2019\n\nVarlack, who was released without bail, declined to comment when contacted on Monday. His lawyer, Allen Leonard Farbman from the Legal Aid Society, also declined to provide a statement.\n\nCreated and discreetly dropped outside the New York Stock Exchange in 1989, \u201cCharging Bull\u201d was meant to serve as an expression of Di Monica\u2019s gratitude to the United States and a source of inspiration for people reeling from the 1987 stock market crash, the artist has said. In recent years, however, the 11-foot-tall, 7,000-pound bull has become the target of activists who have fashioned it as the symbol of various social ills, from inequity and patriarchy to climate change denial and budget cuts.\n\nIn 2011, before the Occupy Wall Street protests exploded, activists painted parts of the bull with the symbol representing anarchy. Later that year, at the height of Occupy Wall Street, police placed barricades around the statue to protect it from activists camping out in the financial district. When the metal barriers were removed, three years after the protests ended, the vandalism returned: In 2017, climate activists splashed blue paint on the statue as a show of \u201csolidarity against climate change denial.\"\n\nOf all the activism affecting Di Modica\u2019s work, the one thing that has attracted the most attention and reportedly caused the artist the most distress is \u201cFearless Girl,\u201d the sculpture of a four-foot bronze girl opposite the bull, commissioned by an investment firm to commemorate \u201cthe power of women in leadership.\" In 2017, following what seemed like a subtweet from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio implying that the artist was against \u201cwomen taking up space,\u201d Di Modica held a news conference denouncing the statue for corrupting the artistic integrity of \u201cCharging Bull,\u201d and he called on local officials to remove it.\n\nMen who don\u2019t like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl. https://t.co/D2OZl4ituJ \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) April 12, 2017\n\n\u201cThe bull belongs to everybody, to the world,\u201d Di Modica said to the New York Post this weekend. \u201cIn New York we must take care of it that nothing happens again.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI did it,\" 42-year-old Tevon Varlack reportedly said to officials, \u201cthe banjo and speaker are mine.\u201d", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ye9fyCKslhCHtGoF5DBmIILaDTg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/35GMFWWTEII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
