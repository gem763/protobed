The driver of the truck, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, was in custody.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled by the news and was receiving regular updates about the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe know that this trade is going on - all such traders in human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice,\u201d he said.\n\nAll those in the container were pronounced dead at the scene after the emergency services were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park, not far from docks on the River Thames.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s foreign ministry said had been in contact with the British authorities over the incident.\n\n\u201cAt present, it has not yet been confirmed whether the truck has a Bulgarian registration,\u201d a foreign ministry spokeswoman said. \u201cThere is also no indication of the nationality of the human bodies found in the truck. British police have warned that the identification of the bodies will take a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDESPERATE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Leo Varadkar said Irish authorities would carry out any investigations necessary if it was established that the truck had passed through Ireland.\n\nPolice is seen at the scene where bodies were discovered in a lorry container, in Grays, Essex, Britain October 23, 2019.

Police had sealed off the surrounding area of the estate with large green barriers as they carried out their investigation.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, we have not identified where the victims are from or their identities and we anticipate this could be a lengthy process,\u201d Essex Police Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters. \u201cThis is an absolute tragedy.\u201d\n\nMills said finding out who the victims were was their top priority, while a key line of inquiry was determining the truck\u2019s route from Bulgaria to Ireland and then onto Britain.\n\nNearby businesses said they had been unable to gain access to their units on the site due to the large police cordon.\n\n\u201cThe police came in the night - they have closed the whole area,\u201d said a worker at a nearby cafe, who declined to give his name.\n\nFor years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in the back of trucks, often seeking to reach the United Kingdom from the European mainland.\n\nSlideshow (34 Images)\n\nIn Britain\u2019s biggest illegal immigrant tragedy in 2000, customs officials found the bodies of 58 Chinese people crammed into a tomato truck at the southern port of Dover.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the latest deaths were an unbelievable human tragedy that needed answers.\n\n\u201cCan we just think for a moment of what it must have been like for those 39 people, obviously in a desperate and dangerous situation, for their lives to end, suffocated to death in a container,\u201d he said.", "description": "British police found the bodies of 39 people inside a truck believed to have come from Bulgaria at an industrial estate near London on Wednesday, and said they had arrested the driver on suspicion of murder.", "authors": ["Hannah Mckay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444084930&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0YG", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
