The pair have not seen each other since 2015. He has never met his son-in-law Harry or grandson, Archie.\n\nThe Duchess is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing the highly personal note.\n\nHer solicitors filed papers last week claiming to publish the letter was a breach of copyright, infringed her privacy and was a breach of the Data Protection Act. Meghan could be called by the paper to be cross-examined while her father appears as a witness for the defence.\n\nShe is facing claims she invaded her own privacy after her US friends provided details of the letter\u2019s contents to an American celeb magazine.\n\nPals of the royal spoke to a journalist from People after Meghan had reportedly sanctioned the move.\n\nShe could now be forced to swear on oath whether she did.\n\nMr Markle received the handwritten five-page letter through Meghan\u2019s California business manager, Andrew Meyer, in August 2018. Despite saying it was hurtful, he vowed to keep it private.\n\nHowever, without warning, Meghan\u2019s friends then spoke anonymously, revealing the letter\u2019s existence describing it as kind and loving.\n\nThey told People magazine: \u201cAfter the wedding, she wrote him a letter.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Dad. I\u2019m so heartbroken. I love you, I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe move led Mr Markle to provide some of its contents in an attempt to defend himself from the friends\u2019 attack.\n\nYesterday he said: \u201cThe letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\u201d\n\nHe still hopes for a reconciliation, saying: \u201cAll it would take is one phone call, and this craziness would stop.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Thomas Markle said he is ready to travel to Britain to defend his actions over the release of a private letter sent to him by the Duchess of Sussex which is now at the centre of a legal battle", "authors": ["Christopher Bucktin", "Image", "Tim Stewart News Limited", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525208.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-PROD-Meghan-Markle-in-her-younger-days-with-her-father-Thomas-Markle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
