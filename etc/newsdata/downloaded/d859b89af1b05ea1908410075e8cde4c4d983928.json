Price expectations are understood to be in the early teens.\n\nThe Australian Red Cross paid $6.8m for the three-level building in 2004.\n\n\u201cRed Cross will reinvest the funds to move to premises in Brisbane\u2019s CBD or CBD fringe that are both more affordable to own or lease, and better suited to the needs of the people we work with,\u201d said Red Cross chief executive Judy Slatyer.\n\n\u201cAs community needs change, the need to operate from a particular premises changes. The sale is part of a national property masterplan that releases value from several key properties and allows us to work in locations that best serve the people who use them, from clients and volunteers to staff and partners.\u201d\n\nColliers International\u2019s Hunter Higgins, Nick Wedge and Guy Wells in conjunction with Christian Sandstrom and Blake Goddard of Knight Frank will steer a national expression of interest campaign closing in late November.
