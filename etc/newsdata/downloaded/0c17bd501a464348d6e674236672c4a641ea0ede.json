Josh Navidi and Liam Williams were ruled out of the tournament last week, while Jonathan Davies and Hadleigh Parkes both headed into the semi-final carrying lingering injuries. It made for less than ideal preparation, not just in the sense of sapping Welsh morale but fundamentally limiting the way in which Gatland\u2019s men could take on the Springboks.\n\nMany suggested in the wake of defeat that Wales should have been more ambitious, more adventurous in their approach, but the reality is that they lacked the personnel to deploy such a game plan. Take into account the absence of Gareth Anscombe and Taulupe Faletau \u2013 both of whom were never part of the equation from day one \u2013 as well as the injury sustained by George North before the break, and it\u2019s easy to see why Wales were so muted at times. They simply didn\u2019t possess the star-factor needed to unpick their stubborn opponents.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

There was none of the thrill and rush of Saturday\u2019s semi-final. This was a grinding, bone-crushing slogfest that drained every kernel of willpower from both sets of players.\n\nBut in attempting to match South Africa for their physicality, Wales were always going to be taking a risk. The sight of Tomas Francis, no shrinking violet, being steam-rolled by Duane Vermeulen early on in the match was a painful reminder of what the Welsh were up against.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s in matches such as these where the dynamism of Faletau would have provided Gatland\u2019s side with the momentum to take the fight to the Springboks. But, instead, it felt like the Welsh were knocked back upon the point of each impact.\n\nAlthough the likes of Aaron Wainwright, Justin Tipuric and Ross Moriarty were certainly capable of competing at the breakdown \u2013 the Welsh turnover count was six to the Springboks\u2019 three \u2013 it was out in open play, with the ball in hand, where Wales\u2019 pack struggled to find a way through. This meant the platform was rarely provided for play to be sent out wide at pace and with the intention of catching their opponents on the back foot.\n\nWales play to South Africa\u2019s strengths\n\nGatland\u2019s men were far too willing to kick away possession. Doing so proved counterproductive and played to South Africa\u2019s strengths. The high ball has always been a key component to Wales\u2019 game but against the Springboks it came undone.\n\nWith Williams out of the picture and North subbed off before half-time due to injury, it made little sense for the Welsh to rely so heavily on the aerial approach. But with the forwards struggling up front, and given the limitations of Parkes and Davies in puncturing the South African defence, it seems the men in red had run short of options. A total of 36 kicks were made from hand, one less than the Springboks\u2019 own count.\n\nIt might for a tedious sight, and at times felt like Wales were attempting to avoid defeat rather than secure victory. Ultimately, it meant the South Africans were rarely forced into adapting their own tactics to that of the Welsh game plan. Wales were far too happy to play the match as dictated by Rassie Erasmus\u2019 men.\n\nBiggar and Patchell fail to deliver\n\nOn a night where the full range of talents at Handre Pollard\u2019s disposal were laid bare under the Yokohama lights \u2013 the composure, the controlled guiding of the game, the exceptional kicking \u2013 Wales\u2019 own fly-halves looked mediocre in comparison.\n\nDan Biggar offered very little in the way of creativity. There was no spark or urgency in his passing. It was all too conservative, too rigid. Although he matched Pollard\u2019s kicking, he certainly didn\u2019t match his vision or ability to control the flow of play.\n\nRhys Patchell\u2019s introduction failed to have the desired effects too. Normally more free-flowing and experimental than his teammate, the Scarlets fly-half was similarly anonymous, kept quite by the South African defence. He\u2019ll also be left to rue the decision in going for that drop-kick attempt when he did. A couple of more phases of play and metres gained could have made all the difference. Instead, Patchell\u2019s effort in the closing stages of the game, with the scoreline at 16-16, fell short and wide, thus handing possession back to the Springboks.\n\nFine margins settle it\n\nThis was by no means a contest that the Springboks outright deserved to win. The post-match statistics, if anything, would suggest that Wales were the dominant side: they made more runs and passes; they won more mauls and rucks; they enjoyed a greater share of possession and territory.\n\nBut as the case with Test matches of this nature, it\u2019s often the fine margins which settle it. A dropped ball here, a missed tackle there, a misplaced pass or kick. \u201cIt was nerve-racking at the end and I must say that losing the previous four matches against them it could have gone their way again,\u201d said Erasmus after the win. \u201cI thought those last few minutes they might pull it through again and I think (there was) a little bit of luck on our side.\u201d\n\nIn the days to come, Wales\u2019 players will no doubt re-live the game in its entirety, scrutinising those key details that went against them. That the scoreline stood at 16-16 with five minutes to go shows you how finely balanced this contest was. In many ways, that makes the defeat even more galling. It really could have been Wales who emerged victorious in Yokohama.", "description": "Injuries cost Welsh dearly Wales\u00a0have been desperately unlucky with injuries.
