Kamala Harris for having boasted of opposing the court-ordered busing that, Harris claims, enabled her to get an integrated education in California.\n\nAsked, in Keene, New Hampshire, how it felt to be in the lovely town, Biden volunteered, \"Look, what's not to like about Vermont.\"\n\nBiden spoke of meeting in his vice president's office with students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the scene of a horrific school shooting. Only the Parkland massacre did not occur until after he left the vice presidency.\n\nSpeaking in the aftermath of shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Biden talked of the recent \"tragic events in Houston and also in Michigan the day before.\" After the shootings in Odessa, Texas, done with an assault rifle, an outraged Joe said it was \"absolutely mindless\" not to ban all firearm magazines that carry more than a single bullet.\n\n\"We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts,\" Biden thundered in Des Moines.\n\nGiven months of campaigning in which the principal feature has been his gaffes, why is Joe still the front-runner?\n\nBecause he has been around so long as a senator and vice president, from 1973 to 2017, is well-known and well-liked, is the most acceptable of the candidates to moderates fearful of the rising radicalism in the party -- and, above all, because every poll shows Biden has the best shot at beating Donald Trump.\n\nBiden has undeniable assets. He was Barack Obama's loyal subaltern. He is seen, even by opponents, as a nice guy, a politician without malice and a pragmatist unencumbered by principle who can slide leftward at the same speed as his party on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nBiden is a believer in the maxim of Sen. Henry Ashurst of Arizona that the \"clammy hand of consistency should never rest for long upon the shoulder of a statesman.\"\n\nAlso, Biden's rivals have proven unimpressive, with the exception of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has steadily plodded upward to challenge the socialist Bernie Sanders for the second position.\n\nBiden's crowds are anemic compared to Warren's. His speeches range from the unexciting to the boring. He has no enticing policy agenda, no inspiring message, no captivating slogan. As a political athlete, he is not even in the same league as Obama or JFK.\n\nHe does not excite the Democratic youth. And if he won in 2020, he would be, at 78, our oldest president. Jill Biden, his wife, made the case for Joe well: \"You may like another candidate better, but you have to look at who's going to win... Joe is that person.\"\n\nLike Warren Harding a century ago, Biden holds out to the nation the promise of a \"return to normalcy.\"\n\nIn his days in the Senate, he was famous for his tough-on-crime stand and his vote to authorize the war in Iraq -- a blunder of historic proportions.\n\nIf elected, at the end of his first term, Biden would be 82. If he sought and served the two terms every president seems to seek, he would, in 2028, be 86 years old on leaving office.\n\nDoes the Joe Biden of the summer of 2019 look like he could be, a decade from now, the dynamic leader America could rely on to face down the successors to China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin?\n\nPrediction: At some point in this campaign, Joe Biden will declare that, if elected, he will only serve one term.\n\nPatrick J.
