Idle No More inspired flash mob round dances, blockades and protests across the country; the movement hit its peak between December 2012 and January 2013.\n\nScheer's planned approach to the relationship remains unclear, aside from indications that a Conservative government would again enforce the Harper-era First Nations Transparency Act and require that band governments post their financial information online.\n\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde says Conservative leader Andrew Scheer needs to signal he won't copy former prime minister Stephen Harper's approach to Indigenous issues.

(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nScheer was booed when he appeared in December during the AFN's special chiefs assembly in Ottawa.\n\nBellegarde, meanwhile, said he has a good relationship with Scheer; he called the Conservative leader a \"Saskatchewan boy\" and pointed out that he hails from the national chief's home region, which covers the Conservative leader's riding of Regina-Qu'Appelle and 12 reserves.\n\nBellegarde said that, if the Conservatives win the fall election, he wants to work with Scheer and help his government build on what he described as progress made over the last four years.\n\n\"Some of their policies aren't as progressive as they can be,\" said Bellegarde. \"It's my job to help him get to where he should be. It's my job to help influence all policy and legislation that they have within the Conservative Party of Canada.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at the Assembly of First Nations meeting in December 2018.\n\nBellegarde said he won't be endorsing any party in the coming federal election campaign.\n\n\"We are all treaty people and we have a treaty relationship with the Crown,\" said Bellegarde.\n\n\"I don't have a treaty with the Conservatives, or the Liberals, or the NDP or the Greens ... and we have to see that being honoured and implemented according to the spirit and intent.\"\n\n'Progress doesn't mean parity'\n\nBellegarde said there has been progress over the last four years under the Liberal government. He said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was the first sitting prime minister to attend and speak at a gathering of the AFN and Liberal ministers regularly attend gatherings held by the organization, which represents 634 First Nations across the country.\n\nHe said the Trudeau Liberals have committed over $21 billion in new investments to Indigenous files over seven fiscal years.\n\n\"That is unprecedented,\" said Bellegarde.\n\nThe Liberal government also reduced the number of First Nations facing long-term boil water advisories, forgave $1.4 billion in loans incurred by Indigenous groups while negotiating modern treaties, and passed laws on Indigenous languages and child welfare.\n\n\"Is the gap closed yet? The answer is no,\" said Bellegarde.\n\nBellegarde said that the next federal government should table a bill on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).\n\nUNDRIP sets out minimum standards on how nation-states should interact with Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\"Canada must lead in upholding the United Nations declaration,\" said Bellegarde.\n\n\"This is about upholding our rights, rights that are too often recognized and not respected.\"\n\nBellegarde said he wants to see a new bill that is as strong or stronger than Bill C-262, the private member's bill introduced by NDP MP Romeo Saganash that died in the Senate. C-262 would have compelled the Canadian government to align its laws with UNDRIP.\n\nBellegarde said the next federal government should commit to fighting climate change, involve First Nations in the struggle and ensure they benefit from the revenue generated by the carbon tax (a policy the federal government presented as revenue-neutral) as part of a new fiscal relationship.\n\n\"First Nations must be first responders in this global emergency,\" he said. \"It's time for action, action that incorporates Indigenous knowledge.\"\n\nBellegarde called on the next federal government to initiate sweeping justice reform to address the disproportionate number of Indigenous people behind bars and acknowledge that First Nations laws are on par with common law and civil law. He said First Nations policing also should be designated an essential service.\n\nHe said the next government should overhaul modern-treaty and self government policies (which would have been replaced under the promised but failed framework for recognition of Indigenous rights) and include First Nations in the development of bills that affect their rights, he said.\n\n\"The time to act is now,\" he said.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer should signal\u00a0he won't copy former prime minister Stephen Harper's approach to the relationship between Ottawa and Indigenous Canadians, says\u00a0Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde.", "authors": ["Jorge Barrera Is A Caracas-Born", "Award-Winning Journalist Who Has Worked Across The Country", "Internationally.
