Brunel strongly denies the allegations.\n\nAccusations of sexual misconduct against Brunel date back several decades, but he has never been prosecuted.\n\nHe told the Guardian in 2015 \"I strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager.\"\n\nIn September, two French women came forward with new accusations against Brunel, whom they accused of sexual assault and of procuring girls for Epstein, French investigative authorities told the UK's Daily Telegraph.\n\nBrunel reportedly disappeared from public view after Epstein's death in August.\n\nOn the official documents, the Beast says that Mnuchin is listed as \"state point of contact\" for Brunel's Next Management Corporation, a company he formed in 1988 with his brother.\n\nA state point of contact is responsible for liaising between a company and the New York Department of State, filing legal documents and receiving lawsuits and other legal information on a company's behalf.\n\nJeffrey Epstein appears in a photo taken for the NY Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry. Reuters\n\nThe Treasury pushed back against the apparent connection between Mnuchin and the company, which it described as erroneous. In a statement to MailOnline, Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley said:\n\n\"Secretary Mnuchin never served in any official capacity in Next Management Corporation, never did any business with nor knows either of the Brunel brothers, and never had any ownership stake in Next Management Corporation or any related entities.\"\n\n\"Secretary Mnuchin had no knowledge whatsoever that he was listed as a point of contact\u2014at an address he's not familiar with \u2014 for a company that he's had no dealings with. That listing was clearly an error.\"\n\nA Treasury spokesperson confirmed to the Beast that Mnuchin is a friend of Faith Kates, who co-founded a separate company, Next Modelling Agency, alongside Brunel and his brother.\n\nNext Management Corp. reportedly owned a 25% stake in Next Modelling Agency.\n\n\"Ms. Kates was never involved with Next Management Corp. in any way,\" a spokesperson told the Beast.\n\n\"Given that, she never designated anyone, including Sec. Mnuchin, to be a DOS process or any officer or director of Next Management Corp.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at Mar-a-Lago in 1992. NBC\n\nJeffrey Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\n\nIn the decades before his arrest he cultivated friends, allies and contacts in elite circles.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself attended social events with Epstein in New York and Florida years before launching his political career.\n\nA video emerged in earlier this year showing the two partying with cheerleaders at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in 1992. Trump was also a guest on Epstein's private plane.\n\nIn a 2002 interview with a New York magazine journalist, Trump said of Epstein \"he's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it \u2014 Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\"\n\nThe president has denied knowing anything about Epstein's criminal activities, and no credible evidence has emerged linking any member of Trump's cabinet to criminal activity by Epstein or his associates.\n\nIn June labour secretary Alexander Acosta was forced to resign after questions about his history as a district attorney in Florida, where Epstein was given a plea deal in the 2000s. It emerged that Acosta agreed to a plea deal brokered by Epstein's legal team that saw the former financier plead guilty to reduced charges.\n\nEpstein served only 13 months in a Florida jail, which he was released from during the day to attend business.", "description": "The Daily Beast reported Monday that Steven Mnuchin acted as a legal representative for a company owned by an associate of Jeffrey Epstein.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80a0e12e22af3c3d45f6c6-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
