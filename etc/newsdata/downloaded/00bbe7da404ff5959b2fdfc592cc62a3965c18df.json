Ambassador Nikki Haley Nimrata (Nikki) HaleyJuan Williams: Why does Trump fear GOP voters? Can Carl DeMaio save the California GOP? Treasury: US deficit tops trillion in 11 months MORE broke the Republican cone of silence by tweeting, \u201cThis can\u2019t continue\u2026,\u201d as the federal budget deficit raced past $1 trillion under President Trump Donald John TrumpTed Cruz knocks New York Times for 'stunning' correction on Kavanaugh report US service member killed in Afghanistan Pro-Trump website edited British reality star's picture to show him wearing Trump hat MORE.\n\nFear of a larger jail-break from the cult of enforced silence among Republicans about Trump\u2019s failures is the big reason the president\u2019s campaign officials have pushed state party officials to cancel Republican presidential primaries in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nAnd that fear explains why the Republican National Committee is withholding polling data on the president from GOP candidates for state and local offices.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cRepublican consultants say the Trump information is being withheld for two reasons: to discourage candidates from distancing themselves from the president, and to avoid embarrassing him with poor results that might leak,\u201d according to the investigative news site ProPublica.\n\nIt is no secret that Trump\u2019s approval rating has been sagging all summer. As of Friday, 53 percent of voters disapproved of him, according to the RealClear Politics average of polls.\n\nWho knows how high that number might go if Republicans began calling out Trump for never building that wall.\n\nAnd what happens if Republicans begin to ask about the missing health care plan that was going to be better than ObamaCare?\n\nTrump has already thinned the ranks of high-profile Republican voices willing to challenge him on his lack of results and impulsive, autocratic behavior. GOP critics are shut down by the threat of being targeted by one of Trump\u2019s angry tweets or worse \u2014 having Trump endorse a far-right opponent.\n\nThen there is this odd political dynamic at play: After losing 41 seats in the midterms and watching the rush of current House Republicans into retirement, the remaining party faithful have concluded that despite Trump\u2019s negatives, their only chance to hold on to power is to stick with Trump\u2019s theatrical bullying and name-calling.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) turned down requests from Republicans looking for someone with strong party credentials to challenge Trump. He said it would have amounted to a \u201ckamikaze mission.\u201d\n\nWhy the talk of political death in launching a primary challenge against Trump?\n\nHere\u2019s the answer, from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll in June. Self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning adults were asked if they are \u201cmore a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?\u201d\n\nFifty-two percent said they are loyal to Trump. How many held a higher allegiance to the party than to Trump? Only 38 percent.\n\nTop Republicans believe they need Trump to hold on to those Republicans who identify with Trump more than with the party.\n\nThe party can\u2019t afford the loss of any voters because already 60 percent of all voters, according to a CNN-SSRS poll released last week, do not think Trump deserves a second term.\n\nIn last week\u2019s special election for a North Carolina congressional district, the Democrat came within 2 percentage points of beating the Republican in a district that Trump won by nearly 12 points in 2016.\n\nAn Emerson poll in August showed former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld William (Bill) WeldJoe Walsh: GOP is a 'cult' and Trump a 'would-be dictator' Five top 2020 Democrats haven't committed to MSNBC climate forum The Hill's Morning Report - Trump takes 2020 roadshow to New Mexico MORE (R) holding 16 percent of the GOP vote in Republican primaries against Trump.\n\nAs Vanity Fair\u2019s Peter Hamby pointed out: \u201cImagine how much media attention would be given to an Obama primary challenger running in double digits at this point in 2011.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Trump is fighting to keep up the mirage of total GOP voter fealty to him. He keeps hammering the phony message that he has set the all-time record for support within the party for any Republican president.\n\nYes, Trump does have strong support from Republicans \u2014 82 percent, according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll.\n\nBut former President George W. Bush set the record in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s fixation with this very disprovable lie is revealing about his anxiety about facing a challenge in the primaries, even from fellow Republicans he has demeaned as the \u201cthree stooges.\u201d\n\nHe is referring to three men who have announced they will run against him in the Republican primary: former Rep. Joe Walsh Joe WalshRNC spokeswoman on 2020 GOP primary cancellations: 'This is not abnormal' The Hill's Morning Report - Trump takes 2020 roadshow to New Mexico Juan Williams: Why does Trump fear GOP voters? MORE (R-Ill.), former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford Marshall (Mark) Clement SanfordJoe Walsh: GOP is a 'cult' and Trump a 'would-be dictator' RNC spokeswoman on 2020 GOP primary cancellations: 'This is not abnormal' The Hill's Morning Report - Trump takes 2020 roadshow to New Mexico MORE (R) and Weld.\n\n\"I\u2019m running because he's unfit,\u201d Walsh said in a recent interview with ABC News. \u201cSomebody needs to step up and there needs to be an alternative. The country is sick of this guy's tantrum. He\u2019s \u2014 he's a child.\"\n\n\"I think we have to have a conversation about what it means to be a Republican,\" Sanford said Sept. 8 on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d adding that today\u2019s GOP \"has lost our way.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s ongoing effort to stop Republican primaries from taking place next year, Walsh said on CNN, is an effort to \u201cdisenfranchise voters.\u201d\n\nNo president in my lifetime has ever short-circuited their party\u2019s presidential primary process. It is contrary to the basic principles of democracy.\n\nIn 1976, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan gave President Gerald Ford a run for his money in the GOP primary. In 1980, Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s primary challenge to President Jimmy Carter Jimmy CarterJuan Williams: Why does Trump fear GOP voters?

Pat Buchanan similarly damaged President George H.W. Bush\u2019s run for reelection in 1992.\n\nBut none of those incumbents did anything so radical as to cancel primaries \u2014 another sad first for this president.\n\nJuan Williams is an author, and a political analyst for Fox News Channel.", "description": "Fear explains why the Republican National Committee is withholding polling data on the president from GOP candidates for state and local offices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonaldnc_09092019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
