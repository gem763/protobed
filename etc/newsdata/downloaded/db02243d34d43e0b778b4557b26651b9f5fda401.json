Today, government regulations ensure the colours are maintained to guarantee the spectacular Insta-worthy effect.

Most of the houses were built in the 1760s as \u2018huurhuisjes\u2019 or rental houses leased for slaves and were painted plain white. The story goes that, when freedom came, the former slaves decorated them in bright colours to symbolise the joy of liberty. Muslim residents added even more colour, painting their houses to celebrate the annual festival of Eid one year and keeping them that way ever since. Today the area is gentrifying fast and several walking tours take you round the cobbled streets of what is the most colourful part of the Rainbow Nation.\n\nTravel details: Premier Holidays has a six-night Cape, Wine and Whales self-drive tour to South Africa (from \u00a3549pp with car hire) including a two-night stay at Protea Hotel in Cape Town, which is a 20-minute walk or ten-minute drive from Bo-Kaap (marriott.co.uk).\n\nChefchaouen, Morocco\n\nThe little town of Chefchaouen, above, is known for its colour-washed buildings that mirror a cloudless Moroccan sky\n\nColour story: Blue buildings for heaven \u2013 and peace\n\nTucked away at the foot of the Rif Mountains is a stunning vision of blue. The little town of Chefchaouen is known for its colour-washed buildings that mirror a cloudless Moroccan sky. It is said the colour was introduced in 1930 by Jewish refugees as a symbol of sky and heaven while others say it goes back to the 15th Century when Jews lived alongside local Moroccans and Moriscos (Muslims who converted to Christianity) and painted the buildings as a nod to celestial powers and to represent peace and safety in their pluralistic hometown. Visit the Kasbah Fortress Museum or hike to a hilltop Spanish mosque to get a very blue, bird\u2019s-eye view.\n\nTravel details: The nearest airport is Tangier, a two-hour drive away.

Along the white sandy beach are rows of houses known as palheiros, characterised by wood or concrete fa\u00e7ades and decorated in bright stripes alternating with white. Back in the 19th Century, these buildings were \u2018haystacks\u2019 \u2013 basic elevated structures with no internal walls \u2013 used by fishermen to store their materials. These days they\u2019ve been re-imagined and partly rebuilt as homes and holiday cottages with internal decoration that often matches their exterior \u2013 splashes of red, blue and yellow against cool white. While you\u2019re there, think about a picnic on the edge of the Aveiro Lagoon, where flowers, fishermen and bird lovers abound.\n\nTravel details: Stay in a typical Costa Nova \u2018haystack\u2019 through Airbnb from about \u00a345 a night for a two-bedroom flat.

In downtown Saint John City you\u2019ll find what locals call \u2018Jellybean Row\u2019. It\u2019s where properties built as temporary accommodation after the Great Fire of 1892 have endured. They are now painted everything from banana yellow and jade green through to pumpkin orange. St John is one of the oldest cities in Canada and the idea of painting the houses began in the 1970s in a bid to inject new life into the declining downtown area.
