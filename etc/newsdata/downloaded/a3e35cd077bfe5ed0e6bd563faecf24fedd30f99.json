Borneo is shared between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nThousands of schools have been forced to close in both countries amid mounting health concerns, while several airports have shut in Indonesian Borneo due to poor visibility.\n\nPeople have been dashing to buy face masks in affected areas and there has been an increase in reports of respiratory illnesses and conditions such as dry and itchy eyes.\n\nOn Friday more than 2,600 schools were closed in Malaysia, education authorities said.\n\nThe worst-affected state was Sarawak, on Borneo, where more than 1,000 schools were shuttered and air quality reached \"hazardous\" levels in one area bordering Indonesia, according to an official index.\n\n- Unleashing rain -\n\nIndonesia meanwhile had some success in \"cloud-seeding\" -- inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes -- and produced a downpour over hard-hit Riau province on Sumatra, disaster agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said.\n\nOver 2,800 \"hotspots\" -- areas of intense heat detected by satellite indicating a likely fire -- had been sighted in two provinces of Indonesian Borneo alone although the number had dropped in Riau, he said.\n\nIndonesia insists it is doing all it can and has deployed about 29,000 personnel from a range of government agencies nationwide in an effort to douse the blazes, many of which burn underground in carbon-rich peat.\n\nAlmost 250 people have been arrested on suspicion of activities that led to the blazes.\n\nExperts say the fires are unlikely to be extinguished until the onset of the rainy season in October and have raised fears of a repeat of the 2015 crisis, the worst smog outbreak for about two decades.\n\nIn many places the current haze \"is comparable to 2015 at the same time of the year,\" Robert Field, a scientist from NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who tracks Indonesia's fire seasons, told AFP.\n\nA major problem for firefighters \"is that once underground and into the peat (the fires) are very difficult to put out and have, for all intents and purposes, an inexhaustible supply of fuel,\" he said.\n\n\"They'll only be put out with the return of monsoon rains.\"\n\nburs-sr/mba/je", "description": "Singapore's skies were clearer Friday and air quality improved as smog from Indonesian forest fires drifted away, easing fears that this weekend's Formula One race may be affected.
