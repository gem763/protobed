But There\u2019s Always Newsmax.", "language": "en", "text": "There is no 12-step program for disgraced network anchors attempting to make a comeback.\n\nBrian Williams was eventually able to rehabilitate himself\u2014getting his own show on MSNBC barely a year after being exposed as a journalistic fabricator\u2014only because the network image-making machine, led by NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, threw its substantial institutional weight behind a meticulously orchestrated campaign to resurrect Williams as a credible purveyor of information.\n\nMegyn Kelly will receive no such backing if she tries climb out of the smoking wreckage of her career.\n\nTo the contrary, in the three days since her ill-considered defense of Halloween blackface on her now now-defunct morning show Megyn Kelly Today, the whole of NBC News\u2014everyone from Lack to Kelly\u2019s on-air colleagues to anonymous staffers quoted in various news reports\u2014has pursued what looks like a merciless public crusade to brand the former Fox News star as as a racially clueless (possibly even racist) privileged white woman, blinded by wealth, celebrity and ego.\n\nSeveral media industry experts told The Daily Beast on Friday that even when Kelly\u2019s blackface crucible is finished, she will likely have very few career opportunities\u2014and none on a par with NBC News. Perhaps she\u2019d be welcome at a second-tier conservative-leaning cable channel like One America News Network or a local station consortium like Sinclair.\n\nIn recent days, executives at CBS, ABC and CNN\u2014outlets that might once have jumped at the chance of hiring her\u2014have displayed a decided lack of interest in her services; even Fox News, where she spent a dozen years and left for NBC after a series of controversies\u2014including accusing the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her, an allegation he denied\u2014has slammed the door on a possible Kelly return, issuing a statement that essentially said there was zero room for her in their programming lineup.\n\n\u201cShe could be hired by an outlet that is not interested in attracting African-American audiences,\u201d said former CNN President Jonathan Klein, who once wished he\u2019d hired Kelly from Fox News. In those days, a decade ago, \u201cshe was an impressive, accomplished, tough, edgy, in-your-face, kickass journalist,\u201d Klein said. But when she came to NBC and tried to impersonate a female-friendly morning show host, \u201cshe tried so hard to spin it the other way to the point where it never felt authentic,\u201d Klein added. \u201cI think what she needs to do is be her authentic self and find a media home that allows her to be whatever that is.\u201d\n\n\u201c Look, she\u2019s controversial. We like controversy. It doesn\u2019t mean we endorse everything she stands for. \u201d \u2014 Chris Ruddy of Newsmax\n\nOnly Newsmax impresario Christopher Ruddy, in an interview with The Daily Beast, sounded bullish about Kelly\u2019s future\u2014saying he\u2019d definitely consider hiring her.\n\n\u201cLook, she\u2019s controversial. We like controversy. It doesn\u2019t mean we endorse everything she stands for,\u201d Ruddy said, noting that he hasn\u2019t spoken to Kelly about her plans. \u201cBut she is a proven cable news ratings leader. She scores big and has a history of it and a proven track record. I\u2019m not gonna shut the door on her. I certainly would look and listen.\u201d\n\nRuddy\u2019s remarks amount to a rare burst of sunshine in what otherwise has been Kelly\u2019s week from hell.\n\nAn article posted Friday on the Daily Mail\u2019s website\u2014just as NBC announced the cancellation of Kelly\u2019s ratings-challenged program that comprised Today\u2019s third hour\u2014was seething with blind quotes from people identified as African-American NBC News staffers who were variously \u201cdeeply hurt\u201d and \u201cappalled\u201d by Kelly\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cShe had no respect for the African-American staff on her team and her apology was both fake and dismissive,\u201d one person was quoted as saying. Another told the Daily Mail: \u201cIf she truly had remorse and felt like she was wrong she should take no money and go into hiding. But she\u2019s greedy and entitled. What the hell does she have to fight for? She\u2019s been fired for being racist on national television. She\u2019s not coming back and she needs to accept that.\u201d\n\nIn an interview that was scheduled to air Friday night on the E! channel\u2014like NBC, a subsidiary of Comcast\u2014Today show personality Jenna Bush Hager described her revulsion at having participated in the infamous panel discussion in which Kelly blurted out her blackface defense.\n\n\u201cIt was horrifying, because it wasn\u2019t what we were there to talk about,\u201d Hager said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s talk of something that would make somebody feel bad, it\u2019s not something we stand for, ever. Not then, not now.\u201d\n\nThe barrage of condemnation from soon-to-be-former NBC News colleagues\u2014which has persisted despite Kelly\u2019s emotional on-air apology Wednesday, during what turned out to be her final show\u2014was occurring while Kelly\u2019s high-powered Hollywood lawyer, Bryan Freedman, spent much of Friday trying to maximize her severance package as she departs the network halfway through a three-year contract worth a reported $69 million.\n\nAs the day ended, Freedman and NBC\u2019s corporate lawyers had yet to reach a resolution.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on right now is akin to the mob coming in and breaking your knees so you can\u2019t work anywhere else,\u201d a rare person sympathetic to Kelly told The Daily Beast on Friday. \u201cShe\u2019s a star and NBC knows that so they are not going to let her leave without significant damage to her reputation.\u201d\n\nIn a terse statement Friday, NBC News announced that \u201cMegyn Kelly Today is not returning. Next week, the 9 a.m. hour will be hosted by other Today co-anchors.\u201d\n\nLittle is known about who will be anchoring the show\u2014or, for that matter, who will be producing it.\n\n\u201cThe plan is for talent to rotate day to day to present it. Everyone you see on screen will be part of that\u201d an industry source with top connections within NBC told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe rumor is that Savannah [Guthrie] will open the show on Monday.\u201d\n\nAl Roker\u2014who was summarily removed from Today\u2019s third hour, along with co-anchor Tamron Hall, to make way for Kelly\u2019s arrival last year\u2014is also expected to play a role in the new, Megyn-less third hour.\n\n\u201cPeople underestimate Al,\u201d said the source. \u201cHe\u2019s really one of the most powerful people on the show. He rarely uses that power, but when he does it lands hard.\u201d\n\nIn what struck many as pointed display of schadenfreude over Kelly\u2019s abrupt banishment, Roker posed this week with Hall for a widely published photo of the two of them yukking it up outside the Broadway show Waitress. \u201cNo one thinks that picture of Tamron with Al was an accident\u201d the industry source said.\n\nThis person added: \u201cThe other big question here is, what\u2019s next for Jackie Levin, Megyn\u2019s producer? She\u2019s very close to [NBC News President] Noah Oppenheim. They play tennis together. But is she producing this new show? As of Friday afternoon, nobody knows.\u201d\n\nAnd the fallout could go much higher.\n\n\u201cRight now, everyone is asking where is the end of the road for Andy Lack? Megyn is now a 10,000-lb dead weight on Andy Lack\u2019s foot, and that foot is already standing in deep water,\u201d the source said, referring to the embattled NBC News chairman who lured Kelly to the network and stood by her through numerous controversies.\n\n\u201cEveryone I know, at every level within NBC, thinks she should never have been at NBC in the first place,\u201d the insider said. \u201cShe had obviously said racist things before she came to NBC, and the feeling was: why are we giving her a job, and platform, here?\u201d\n\nAt Fox News\u2014where Kelly\u2019s 9 p.m. show had attracted a viewership that sometimes bested her lead-in, Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2014she occasionally had trafficked in racial divisiveness, famously claiming that Santa Claus and Jesus Christ were white men while airing repeated outraged segments on how a couple of members of the New Black Panther Party were scaring white voters at a Philadelphia polling place.\n\n\u201c The talent on the Today show was nervous every time they had to stand next to her. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe talent on the Today show was nervous every time they had to stand next to her,\u201d said the industry source. \u201cYou never knew what was going to come out of her mouth. They all felt exposed.\u201d\n\nThe fact that none of Kelly\u2019s NBC colleagues has offered support is revealing, the source said. \u201cThe thing at NBC is, when someone is attacked or down, people rally around them. That hasn\u2019t happened here. For Megyn, it\u2019s been crickets.\u201d\n\nFew at NBC News are mourning Kelly\u2019s departure. A staffer told The Daily Beast: \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of frustration and relief\u2014frustrated that we\u2019re in this position, but relieved that the Band-Aid has been ripped. There\u2019s a ton of people here working really hard and producing good stuff. I think they just want that to be the story for a while.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Lachlan Cartwright, Maxwell Tani and Asawin Suebsaeng", "description": "Media industry experts told The Daily Beast that even when Kelly\u2019s blackface crucible is finished, she will have very few career opportunities.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Tim Teeman", "Editor At Large", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1540601559/181026-lachtani-megyn-follow-tease_d2zqwg", "published_at": "2018-10-27"}
