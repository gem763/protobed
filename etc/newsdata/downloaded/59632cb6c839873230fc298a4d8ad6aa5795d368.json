The contents of your shopping basket may change\n\nWhat you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects.\n\nAlmost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal.\n\nThe five-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer - the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns:\n\nSome fresh food supplies will decrease\n\nKey ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply\n\nThere won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice\n\nPrices may also increase \"which could impact vulnerable groups\"\n\nSupermarkets themselves have warned that there could be empty shelves and higher prices.\n\nIn preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg.\n\nStockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, as warehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas.\n\nThe government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption.\n\nIt has also published a \"tariff schedule\", which has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal.\n\nShoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warned credit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer.\n\n2. Electricity and gas prices may go up\n\nAlthough there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there are likely to be significant price rises for businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns.\n\nThe market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets.\n\nYellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms \"exit\" the energy market, \"exacerbating\" the economic and political impact of Brexit.\n\nThe warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which said the UK could be \"more vulnerable to supply shortages in the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages\" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nGetty Images Where does the UK's gas come from? 46% UK domestic production\n\n45% Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway\n\n8%Liquefied natural gas imports Source: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 2018 provisional data (figs may not total 100% due to rounding)\n\nThe risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said.\n\nThe bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless.\n\n3. You will need to take extra measures when travelling to Europe\n\nMillions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe.\n\nIf you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork.\n\nTravel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before.\n\nPassports\n\nThe government is advising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months if you are travelling to most countries in Europe - the full list is here.\n\nUntil recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document.\n\nBut the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time left with this government tool.\n\nYou'll need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks.\n\nVisas\n\nYou won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study.\n\nWhen new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be on each country's travel advice page.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nBorder control\n\nThe government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to:\n\nshow a return or onward ticket\n\nshow you have enough money for your stay\n\nuse separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens\n\nThe government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports.\n\nEuropean health cover\n\nIn addition, if there is no deal, then in theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist.\n\nThe government is advising travellers \"whether there's a deal or not\" to \"get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover\".\n\nMinisters say it is \"particularly important\" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition. This is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not.\n\nTravel\n\nHowever you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption.\n\nIf you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents:\n\na \"green card\", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company)\n\na GB sticker\n\nan International Driving Permit for some countries (you can check if you need one on the Post Office website)\n\nThe government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal.\n\nAn earlier government assessment had warned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensure their services run as smoothly as possible.\n\nHowever, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run.\n\nPets\n\nAfter Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow a different process, involving a number of vet's tests. The process could take up to four months.\n\nBank cards\n\nIf you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the government has warned that it may become more expensive.\n\n4. You may need to check medication is available and it may be more expensive\n\nWhile there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse.\n\nThe government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are \"particularly vulnerable\" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says.\n\nMore than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, and about 7,000 come from or via the EU.\n\nMinisters and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU.\n\nThe government has announced a further \u00a3434m of funding and other measures, including:\n\nextra warehouse space for medicines\n\nsecuring additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone\n\nbuilding buffer stocks\n\nbooking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment\n\nmaking changes to regulatory requirements\n\nstrengthening processes to deal with shortages\n\nHowever, the National Audit Office has said there are still \"significant\" gaps in the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes.\n\n5. UK nationals living abroad may have to take extra measures\n\nAbout 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries.\n\nThe UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now.\n\nIn event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services.\n\nHowever, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can \"expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time\".\n\nThe government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing \u00a3138m.\n\nIt advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevant country advice pages.\n\nHealth\n\nUK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country.\n\nHowever, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority.\n\nIts Yellowhammer report warns that while EU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing \"substantial costs\".\n\nInformation on how to access healthcare abroad can be found on the NHS website.\n\nPensions\n\nThe UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU.\n\nTax\n\nThe UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries.\n\nThese ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights.\n\nDrivers\n\nUK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live.\n\n6. EU citizens need to apply for 'settled status'\n\nThe UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK.\n\nThere are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThe ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum.\n\nStatisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline.\n\nIf you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has a tool to find out what you need to do and when.\n\nHome Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned that the UK will deport EU citizens after Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button\n\n7. Importing goods from the EU may get more expensive\n\nImporting goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure.\n\nAs a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU.\n\nBut after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world.\n\nIndividuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than \u00a3135.\n\nIn March, the government published a 1,477-page document outlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published an update to the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy.\n\nA tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods.\n\nUnder the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free.\n\nTariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection.\n\n8. House prices could be affected\n\nMost commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market.\n\nUK house prices rose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012, according to the Office of National Statistics.\n\nBrexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were \"pretty much flatlining\", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said.\n\nThe Bank of England says the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant.\n\nIt has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a \"disorderly Brexit\". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10% fall in house prices by 2021 in the event of no-deal.\n\nBut bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder.\n\n9. Some ports and motorways could see extra delays\n\nUp to 85% of lorries using the main channel crossings \"may not be ready\" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days, the government's Yellowhammer report warns.\n\nThese queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months.\n\nEven after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said.\n\nRemind yourself of the Brexit basics with:\n\nIn the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side.\n\nIf that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used.\n\nKent County Council says it has employed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal.\n\nTo ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that 88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system.\n\nThe government has also announced \u00a3344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations.\n\n10. UK students studying in the EU and EU students studying in the UK face a period of uncertainty\n\nMore than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17.\n\nUK universities say they would expect a similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.\n\nThe government and the EU have agreed that people who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them.\n\nThis is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK.\n\nThe government has also issued a \"guarantee\" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun.\n\nInstitutions are being advised to apply for this \"HMG guarantee\" to ensure they get the funding.\n\nMeanwhile, Universities UK has launched a campaign supporting opportunities for studying abroad.\n\nBy Lucy Rodgers, Mike Hills and Dominic Bailey.", "description": "From your weekly shop to your holiday plans, how could a no-deal Brexit affect you?", "authors": ["The Visual Journalism Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BD7B/production/_108970584_basket_fruitveg_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
