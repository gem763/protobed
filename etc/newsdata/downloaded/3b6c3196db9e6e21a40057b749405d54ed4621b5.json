Bill Lee signed into law earlier this year \u2013 applied to two lawsuits currently seeking to block the rules from being enforced. Trauger denied the state\u2019s attempt to dismiss the lawsuits and issued lengthy warnings about the law\u2019s likely \u201cchilling effect\u201d on organizations and individuals who seek to register new voters in Tennessee.\n\nThe law is likely the nation\u2019s first to fine groups for turning in too many incomplete registration forms. It also imposes misdemeanor charges for other intentional infractions of new rules. Only paid groups could be penalized under the law, though the legal filings contend the distinction is unclear due to the groups\u2019 use of grant money and stipends for workers in certain cases.\n\n\u201cWhile it is conceivable that some large, smoothly functioning organizations which limit themselves to heavily planned voter registration activities might be able to comply with the pre-registration requirement without too great a hardship, that is no basis for chilling the speech of organizations for which it would be a burden,\u201d Trauger wrote.\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Tre Hargett has argued that adding penalties bolsters election security. His office said Monday that they don\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n\nPreviously, Hargett\u2019s office has said many of the 10,000 registrations submitted in and around Memphis last year by the Tennessee Black Voter Project on the last day for registering were filled out incorrectly.\n\nUnder the new law, the state can fine groups that submit 100 or more incomplete voter registration forms that lack a name, address, date of birth, declaration of eligibility or signature. Penalties can reach $10,000 per county where violations occur if more than 500 incomplete forms are submitted. The bill also outlaws out-of-state poll watchers.\n\n\u201cTennessee\u2019s law is one of the most restrictive voter suppression measures that we have seen this year. This is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to discourage and deter people from helping others to register to vote,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, in a statement in response to Trauger\u2019s decision.\n\nIn her ruling, Trauger questioned why the law required voter registration organizers to file sworn statements confirming they would comply with the law \u2013 adding that \u201cthe law is the law already, no one has to swear to follow it in order for it to apply.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Trauger questioned the necessity of imposing training requirements on voter registration organizers, as currently outlined in the law.\n\n\u201cIf Tennessee is concerned that voter registration drives are being done incompetently, it can engage in public education efforts without relying on a complex and punitive regulatory scheme,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf it is concerned that the drives are being done fraudulently \u2013 for example, by a person or organization collecting forms and never turning them in \u2013 it can punish the fraud rather than subjecting everyone else to an intrusive prophylactic scheme that true bad actors would likely evade regardless.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge handed down tough criticism on Tennessee's new restrictions for signing up voters while refusing to dismiss a legal challenge surrounding the new law set to take effect in October", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kimberlee Kruesi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/Voter_Registration_Tennessee_33362.jpg-6fa77_c0-143-6019-3652_s1770x1032.jpg?01eb2faafa1608475592965173d812fdeb1ac10a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
