PrEP+, at its core, was an extremely well-publicized version of the parties that happen in warehouselike venues all the time and whose raunchier incarnations are in fact flourishing thanks to PrEP. The problem is that parties like these typically thrive due to lack of an outer gaze, and with a shared understanding of what happens there. The crowd Ocean\u2019s event drew, judging from the reports that have come out, wasn\u2019t entirely equipped for the party he\u2019d advertised. They gawked and stood around and weren\u2019t sure what the point was. Maybe the best way to think of PrEP+ is as a museum installation about having fun: not a very cool thought.\n\nIf PrEP+ was an art piece, though, it was also activism that should be judged partly on terms of efficacy and responsibility. Bafflingly, no organizations doing work related to HIV/AIDS have been identified as being involved. Ocean\u2019s $60 PrEP+ T-shirts, as far as it\u2019s known, are not benefiting any charitable cause. \u201cAwareness,\u201d Ocean\u2019s stated aim, is a slippery concept. A recent CDC study of 20 urban areas estimated that 90 percent of men who have sex with men know about the drug. And Truvada\u2019s greatest barrier to more widespread usage\u2014as Ocean noted in his Tumblr post\u2014has arguably been its high price tag, though for many Americans the pill is free due to insurance coverage or manufacturer discounts. (Gilead recently announced that it would donate enough pills to cover 200,000 patients for more than a decade).\n\nThat said, there\u2019s a case to be made that simply affiliating the word PrEP with a hyped cultural happening could help promote its adoption. Pete Staley of the pivotal AIDS-fighting organization Act Up criticized Ocean\u2019s event, but he also told Paper, \u201cIn the end, I\u2019m much less concerned about their minor flubs in messaging than the fact that Frank Ocean is talking about PrEP and HIV. He\u2019ll reach far more young gay black men than a hundred white gay PrEP activists ever will.\u201d (He also added, \u201cAnd if he uses these events to plug U=U as well, he\u2019ll save many lives,\u201d referring to the campaign to inform people that \u201cundetectable equals untransmittable,\u201d which means that treatment for HIV-positive individuals can prevent the disease from spreading).\n\nOn Saturday night, broadcasting from his Beats 1 show Blonded Radio, Ocean said, \u201cQuit acting like we didn\u2019t turn y\u2019all up. I don\u2019t get it. Diverse crowds, beautiful crowds.\u201d He also released a new song, which a cynic might see as an attempt to divert attention from the party\u2019s fallout. But the art for the single, \u201cDHL,\u201d is in the same style\u2014psychedelic and graffiti-like, reminiscent of, among other things, rave flyers\u2014that the poster for PrEP+ was in. The song\u2019s keyboards and bass seem to ooze, engulfing the ear as Ocean mumbles words that are mysterious, allusive, and totally gay (\u201cBoy toy ride me like a Uber,\u201d goes one line). It\u2019s a classic Ocean song in its ambiguity, eroticism, and powerful handle on atmosphere\u2014virtues that he did not translate into the art of event planning, it appears. But he has promised more parties, which means he has another chance to rethink the imperfect past, the imperfect present, and what might be next.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
