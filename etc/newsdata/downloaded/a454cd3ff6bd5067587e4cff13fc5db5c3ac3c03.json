I\u2019m so glad our paths crossed, forever and always my friend.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m gutted. I kind of thought \u2013 hoped \u2013 that we had a couple of weeks left,\u2019 Catherine added. \u2018I struggled with the Cha Cha, it was evil.\u2019\n\nCatherine wiped her eye (Picture: BBC)\n\nEmotions ran high (Picture: BBC)\n\nRylan then played the pair a compilation of their Strictly journey and it sent Catherine over the edge.\n\n\u2018I can clearly see you\u2019re both emotional, but how does it feel watching all of that back?\u2019 Rylan asked. \u2018Did it seem like a blur? Did you even remember it?\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just sent me off the edge,\u2019 Catherine admitted as she wiped her eye.\n\nViewers were also in bits over Catherine and Johannes\u2019 emotions and raced to Twitter to comment, with one writing: \u2018Oh dear. I\u2019ve gone again @jojo_radebe is such a sweetheart and a delight as well as a fabulous dancer.\n\n\u2018Seeing him upset is so sad I\u2019ll miss him.\u2019\n\nEchoing a similar sentiment, another posted: \u2018Aw Cath and Jojo\u2019 followed by a string of crying emojis.\n\nElsewhere on tonight\u2019s It Takes Two, Saffron Baker revealed she sustained not one, but two injuries during training with AJ Pritchard.\n\nIt Takes Two continues tomorrow at 6.30pm on BBC Two.", "description": "Strictly Come Dancing's Catherine Tyldesley and Johannes Radebe break down in tears on It Takes Two.", "authors": ["Cydney Yeates"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cath-cry-0250_1572294647.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
