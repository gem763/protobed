Coronation Street\u2019s Lucy Fallon has received backlash from viewers of the programme, who have been calling out Bethany Platt for sharing a kiss with Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) while his wife Sinead (Kate McGlynn) was dying.\n\nDubbed by Tracy McDonald (Kate Ford) as a cow, Bethany has been left upset by her actions but, as Gail Rodwell (Helen Worth), explained to her, the kiss was a result of a lot of confused and mixed up emotions from both Bethany and Daniel.\n\nMany fans have not been seeing it that way and have been attacking Bethany \u2013 and sometimes even Lucy herself \u2013 on Twitter and other social media as a result.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun, Lucy explained: \u2018People are not very happy with me. It\u2019s been really hard. It\u2019s one of those stories that\u2019s so important and so many people have been affected by it.\n\n\u201cEveryone who watched it will be able to relate to it in a kind of way. And there have been a few nasty comments on my social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But do you know what I find funny? People sometimes can\u2019t differentiate between me as a person and the character I play. It\u2019s just like, \u201cYou are the worst person in the world.\u201d I feel like it was important for Corrie to show that Daniel was suffering so much, and he was losing his mind, that the kiss was just a moment where he wanted comfort.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t like he was \u201ccheating\u201d on his wife. I don\u2019t see it like that. And Bethany is obviously guilt-stricken.\u2019\n\nLucy recently heaped praise on the storyline and revealed that it had prompted her to go for her first ever cervical smear test. The plot has led to a huge increase of women having smear tests, according to GP surgeries whose appointments have been filled up.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Fans are not happy with the Corrie twist.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EMBARGO_21_10_CORO_BETHANY_DANIEL_2ND_EP-7466_1572272315.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
