The one is passive and the other active,\u201d he explained.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nColin Coleman, CEO of Goldman Sachs sub-Saharan Africa said while there is evidence of green shoots in the economy, especially in sectors such as mining, \u201cSouth Africa needs to act quickly to get our house in order and move forward decisively\u201d if the country is to break out of its no growth trap and win back business and investor confidence.\n\nCEO of Business Leadership South Africa, Busisiwe Mavuso, said there is a disconnect between South Africa attempting to position itself as an investment destination and the decision-making paralysis around important policy issues.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarkets are premised on certainty, and the current lack of certainty is very problematic. There is no way we are going to unlock investment, either local or foreign, when people don\u2019t know which direction this country is going to go. You cannot be talking prescribed assets and expect that investment is going to flow.\u201d\n\nThe ability to make tough decisions is a function of leadership, she added, and cautioned \u201cvery soon the IMF is going to walk in and make the tough decisions for us.\u201d\n\n\n\nMavuso used the continued inaction around the restructuring of state-owned enterprises as an example of this paralysis.\n\n\u201cWe have more than 700 SOEs and we can\u2019t play across the entire global value chain. South Africa is failing at the basics at the moment when it comes to government and the more we delay the tough decisions, the more our window of opportunity as a country is closing.\u201d\n\nThe country needs robust growth in order to expand the tax base and reduce reliance on social grants, she added.\n\nThandeka Gqubule, economics editor of the SABC, said no country had been able to recover from a recessionary environment without lowering its cost of capital or issuing a meaningful fiscal stimulation package.\n\n\u201cThe government can reduce the cost of capital urgently to give the economy a breather, and give our manufacturing and export sectors a boost,\u201d she recommended.\n\nColeman said while lowering the cost of capital was one of the fiscal and monetary weapons at our disposal, cutting expenditure in the form of the public sector wage bill was an urgent priority.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly 10% of South Africa\u2019s debt is issued in foreign currency, which will help us to absorb any potential shock, but there is not much room to raise further capital. We have to cut back on wasteful and inefficient expenditure, and cut the public service and force them to be more efficient.\u201d\n\nHe said the medium-term budget policy statement, due to be delivered by the minister of finance on October 30, will be a critical message to the world about the country\u2019s fiscal health.\n\n\n\nInequality and social unrest\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for poverty and unemployment in this country; we suffer from an overdose of greed in South Africa,\u201d Paul Verryn, bishop of the central district for the Methodist Church of Southern Africa told the forum.\n\nFrom an economic point of view, he argued that very little has shifted since 1994, and \u201cit is not going to shift if we don\u2019t think right out of the box. We don\u2019t need history to tell us, if we carry on with this trajectory, we will have a civil war.\u201d\n\nMavuso said the correlation between high unemployment and social unrest had been proven, and the general consensus is that the biggest ticking time bomb is unemployment.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a recipe for disaster. It is about the haves and the have-nots, and not about black and white anymore. The fight is going to quickly be brought to our Sandton doorstep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe lack empathy as a society, and we are going to be forced to sit up and pay attention to that which we have chosen to ignore if we don\u2019t change the social and economic patterns of this country,\u201d she added.\n\nBack to basics\n\nMavuso called for a return to basics and an analysis of the role of government in society: \u201cGovernment exists to make a conducive environment. Conditions for people to prosper are not God-given, but are rather created. We need intentional participation in the economy and macro economic policy to change its structure. Jobs are an output, or a consequence of a conducive environment in which business can prosper.\n\n\u201cThese tough decisions that are going to have to be taken by government, as the role of government is to make these decisions and not to try and please everyone,\u201d she concluded.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are a profoundly damaged nation,\u201d Verryn said.\n\n\u201cOur anger and vitriol comes out in violence again women, children and foreign nationals. We must all ask ourselves how we can become active agents for the healing of this country, as we really are on a tipping point.\n\n", "description": "Many South Africans are finding the country\u2019s continued economic malaise and increasing levels of social unrest and violence overwhelming.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9458/563c16cb068249309545fe616b6ef226.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
