The study analyzed data from 196,383 adults of European ancestry aged 60 and older. Of that sample, the researchers identified 1,769 cases of dementia over a follow-up period of eight years.\n\nThe risk of dementia was 32% lower in people with a high genetic risk if they had followed a healthy lifestyle, compared to those with an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nHere\u2019s what they found: Participants with high genetic risk and an unfavorable lifestyle were almost three times more likely to develop dementia versus those with a low genetic risk and favorable lifestyle. However, the risk of dementia was 32% lower in people with a high genetic risk if they had followed a healthy lifestyle, compared to those with an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\n\u201cThis research delivers a really important message that undermines a fatalistic view of dementia,\u201d said co-lead author David Llewellyn, an associate professor at the University of Exeter Medical School and fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. \u201cSome people believe it\u2019s inevitable they\u2019ll develop dementia because of their genetics.\u201d This research, however, says that may not be the case.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why the middle-aged \u2018dad bod\u2019 could be deadly instead of sexy\n\nHere\u2019s what to avoid: The study, published Monday by scientists at the University of Exeter and presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in Los Angeles, looked at four main signs of a healthy versus unhealthy lifestyle. Those who were more likely to develop dementia reported eating an unhealthier diet higher in sugar and salt, did not engage in regular physical activity and smoked cigarettes. (The researchers considered \u201cmoderate alcohol consumption,\u201d as well as regular exercise, no smoking and a healthy diet, as part of a healthy lifestyle.)\n\nDrinking at least one artificially sweetened beverage daily was associated with almost three times the risk of developing stroke or dementia.\n\nA 2017 study found a fifth item worth avoiding: Artificial sweeteners. \u201cDrinking at least one artificially sweetened beverage daily was associated with almost three times the risk of developing stroke or dementia compared to those who drank artificially sweetened beverages less than once a week,\u201d according to the study, published in the American Heart Association journal \u201cStroke.\u201d\n\nBeware of the medicine cabinet: Researchers also found a statistically significant association between dementia and exposure to anticholinergic drugs, especially antidepressants, anti-psychotic drugs, anti-Parkinson drugs, anti-epilepsy drugs and bladder antimuscarinics, which are used to treat urinary incontinence, according to another study in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Did you have heart surgery? Doctors say this could help you live longer\n\nSeparate research published last month analyzed data from 284,343 patients in England aged 55 and up. They found \u201cnearly a 50% increased odds of dementia\u201d linked with exposure to more than 1,095 daily doses of anticholinergics over 10 years, \u201cequivalent to three years\u2019 daily use of a single strong anticholinergic medication at the minimum effective dose recommended for older people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found greater increases in risk associated with people diagnosed with dementia before the age of 80, which indicates that anticholinergic drugs should be prescribed with caution in middle-aged and older people,\u201d the researchers wrote. Anticholinergic drugs block a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine in the nervous system.\n\nOne 2013 New England Journal of Medicine study found that the yearly dementia-attributable societal cost per person in 2010 was $41,689 to $56,290, depending on the calculation. Costs included nursing home care, out-of-pocket spending, home care and Medicare. A separate invited commentary also published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine praised the rigor of the new findings, but cautioned that more evidence was needed.\n\n(Meera Jagannathan contributed to this story.)", "description": "The study was published this month by scientists at the University of Exeter and presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference 2019 in...", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO081_na_mem_ZG_20190724140556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-15"}
