But some relatives, expressing bitterness at the way former comrades had ousted Mugabe, had pushed for him to be buried in his home village.\n\nAfrican heads of state, including long-ruling leaders from Equatorial Guinea and Congo, started arriving in Zimbabwe on Thursday night for Mugabe's funeral.\n\nBanners reading \"Hamba kahle, Gushungo,\" (go well, Gushungo)\" in reference to Mugabe's clan name and \"Pioneer of nationalist politics,\" were on display at the national stadium ahead of a state funeral.\n\nCleo Mapuranga, a caterer, told Reuters: \"I feel low because Mugabe fought for us. I remember him for land to the blacks, economic freedom and higher education which was non-racial.\"\n\n\"Now, people are suffering. No one is controlling the prices in the shops. Our finance minister is trying to implement first-world policies which don't work in third-world countries.\"\n\nMnangagwa's government has taken steps to cut the budget deficit, remove subsidies on fuel and power and repeal laws curbing public and media freedoms, but those reforms and austerity measures have compounded ordinary people's hardships.\n\nMugabe was feted as a champion of racial reconciliation when he came to power in 1980 in one of the last African states to throw off white colonial rule.\n\nBy the time he was toppled in 2017 to wild celebrations across the country of 13 million, he was viewed by many at home and abroad as a power-obsessed autocrat who unleashed death squads, rigged elections and ruined the economy to keep control.", "description": "Foreign leaders, supporters bid farewell to Zimbabwe's Mugabe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8D039_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
