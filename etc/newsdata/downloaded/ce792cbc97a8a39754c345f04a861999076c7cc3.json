The latest move casts more doubt on whether the world\u2019s two largest economies will find a resolution to their long-running and economically damaging trade war. Envoys from the U.S. and China are preparing for another round of negotiations this week.\n\nTechnology stocks were among the biggest losers as chipmakers absorbed the impact of the latest U.S. restrictions on sales to China. The sector has been absorbing much of the volatility from swings in trade war sentiment because many of the companies face bigger risks to sales and supply chains.\n\nSeveral medical device makers knocked down health care stocks. Thermo Fisher fell 3.9% and Boston Scientific fell 4%. Banks also dropped as bond yields fell. Bank of America shed 2.4%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.51% from 1.55% late Monday in a signal that investors are heading for low-risk investments amid the trade war turmoil. Utilities and real estate companies, both safe-play sectors, held up better than the rest of the market.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P; 500 index fell 1.3% as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 304 points, or 1.1%, to 26,181. The Nasdaq fell 1.5%.\n\nOVERSEAS: European markets fell broadly. The British government warned that chances of a separation deal with the European Union are fading. The U.K. is on track to leave the 19-nation trading block on Oct. 31 but doesn\u2019t yet have an agreement on trade in place.\n\nThe separation is also weighing on the broader European economy, which is already facing slower growth amid international trade disputes.\n\nAsian stocks were broadly higher. Markets in the Chinese mainland resumed trading after a weeklong holiday.\n\nSOFT DOUGH: Domino\u2019s Pizza fell 4.1% after a key sales measure for the pizza chain fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Sales at established locations grew at a surprisingly slow rate in the third quarter. The company also eliminated its long-term forecast and replaced it with a shorter view with lower sales growth.\n\nCRUSHED CHIPS: Chipmakers tumbled after the U.S. blacklisted a group of Chinese tech companies that develop facial recognition and other artificial intelligence technology. The U.S. said that technology is being used to repress China\u2019s Muslim minority groups. The blacklist effectively bars U.S. firms from selling technology to the companies without government approval.\n\nAmbarella fell 10.3% and Nvidia fell 3.2%.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Increased tensions ahead of U.S.-China trade negotiations knocked down stocks on Wall Street in early trading Tuesday and stretched the market's losses deeper into a fourth week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Damian J.
