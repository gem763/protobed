Patients report similar exposures and symptoms according to the CDC, \u201cTherefore lung illnesses are likely associated with a chemical exposure. However, it is too early to pinpoint a single product or substance common to all cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're deeply concerned for the people affected. I think the entire industry is. We're watching this very closely. We're trying to identify, just as the regulators and legislators are, exactly what is causing this,\u201d said Nick Kovacevich, CEO of KuschCo Holdings Inc. The company\u2019s shares are publicly traded OTC (KSHB) and it is the parent company of Kush Supply, which makes vaping devices and accessories but not the actual products or liquids people inhale when they vape marijuana or nicotine.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously something that\u2019s come on very new, even though people have been vaping cannabis and CBD products for five to six years,\u201d he told Yahoo Finances On the Move.\n\nImpact of black market on vaping\n\nKush Supply describes itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest and most respected premier producer of vaporizer products, packaging, supplies, and accessories.\u201d Sixty-nine percent of its revenue in the third quarter, $28.8 million, was generated by vape-related products.\n\nKovacevich said the vaping industry is trying to identify what is causing some people who vape to become ill although he suspects the people who have become sick may have purchased products on the black market.\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cMany of the patients, but not all, reported recent use of THC (a chemical found in marijuana) containing products, some reported using both THC and nicotine containing products. A smaller group reported using nicotine only.\u201d\n\nKovacevich said it\u2019s time for the government to regulate vaping products although marijuana is considered a Schedule 1 drug and not approved by the federal government for use in the United States. However, it is available in states that have legalized medical and recreational use of marijuana.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been calling to make cannabis legal and accessible so that it can be in a regulated system where it\u2019s tested for these type of safety measures to make sure there\u2019s no toxins or pesticides or chemicals that can be harmful,\u201d Kovacevich said.\n\nKansas State Health Officer Dr. Lee Norman says he\u2019s extremely alarmed. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop vaping. The recent deaths across our country, combined with hundreds of reported lung injury cases continue to intensify,\u201d said Norman.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to determine if the growing health crisis will lead to a drop in demand for vaping products, according to Kovacevich. \u201cOur belief is that this is actually going to drive more sales to the legal channels, more sales to our customers that we service because we only service legal, compliant operators, and therefore more sales to us,\u201d he said.\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "description": "A sixth person died from lung disease related to vaping but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still trying to determine what is making more than 450 people nationwide ill.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DkVs42mcdAZQZOF4UEuqFA--~B/aD0yMzM5O3c9MzY1ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/52880d30-2ebf-11e9-bf3f-105369e17a3b", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
