(Olivia Harris/Reuters)\n\nOasis front man Liam Gallagher won\u2019t look back in anger. Well, maybe a little.\n\nLiam Gallagher lived his twenties and thirties as rock\u2019s maximum jackass, greeting the world middle fingers first as the front man of the 1990s-defining band Oasis. He wasn\u2019t just a bad boy; he was out to be the worst boy. Scarcely a month went by without him producing yet another outrage to delight tabloid editors. You can\u2019t be a bad boy at 46, though, so by now Liam Gallagher really ought to be dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam gets this; he figures the newspapers have stories queued up to go about how he finally destroyed himself with drugs or a bullet. \u201cI know how f***ing great I am and what a royal s*** I am,\u201d he says in the doc Liam Gallagher: As It Was, adding, \u201cI\u2019m proud of staying alive . . . not becoming a f***ing casualty.\u201d Remembering the atrocious behavior, both personal and professional, leads very nearly to a hint of contrition: \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re in a band,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re in a bit of a bubble . . . there\u2019s a real life sort of going on around you but you\u2019re not connected to it. This time the bubble had burst and I\u2019d landed in the f***ing reality and the reality was not that good.\u201d\n\nGallagher\u2019s childlike inability to dissemble has always been one of his most appealing qualities. To their immense credit, Oasis didn\u2019t traffic in peace-and-love twaddle but reveled in their roles as snarling pub louts who became kings of the pop world. (The documentary Oasis: Supersonic, which is streaming on Netflix, is a glorious romp through their whole sordid story.) The band ended Hiroshima-style, with a ten-megaton rage detonation just before a Paris gig in 2009. Noel, the smaller, older brother who wrote virtually all of the hits and also played lead guitar, smashed one of Liam\u2019s guitars, or so says Liam. Naturally Liam smashed one of Noel\u2019s in reply. The band stormed out of the gig, then the tour, then ceased to exist when Noel announced he could not work with his brother. The two haven\u2019t spoken in ten years. Liam remains slightly miffed about all this. \u201cPeople go oh, Noel\u2019s grown up and he\u2019s changed,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever, he\u2019s changed into a massive c***. I\u2019m just still a c***. I\u2019m not a massive c***.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam\u2019s follow-up band, Beady Eye, didn\u2019t catch on, and in a Spinal Tap\u2013like series of humiliations documented in this amusing film, he found his new gang booked in tiny clubs and himself so desperate for income that he became a fashion brand. Ladies\u2019 department stores such as the one in which he is shown hawking his new line of merch are not very rock and roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet Liam rebounded in a 2017 record, As You Were, that hit number one on the U.K. charts. (In the U.S., Oasis never caught on; I used to see them at New York City clubs like Roseland at a time when they were filling stadiums in Britain.) Liam Gallagher: As It Was is essentially a promotional video meant to push that album and a follow-up, Why Me? Why Not., which arrives next week, so it is reticent about his many bad choices, dismissed in a brief montage as \u201cpersonal problems.\u201d The movie also feels like an extended plea to an audience of one: Perhaps Noel will see it, and notice that Liam has mended his ways? Their bad blood does go back a bit, though. Liam recalls fondly the time he peed on his older brother\u2019s stereo when the two were sharing a tiny bedroom in Manchester, in the house where their Mum Peggy still lives. \u201cThat\u2019s when I think the grudge started,\u201d Liam reflects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese days, Liam looks alert and healthy, and makes a reasonable effort to sound humble as he rebuilds his career. He is lean, wears his hair short, goes running a lot. He got hit with a mighty slap of changing-times symbolism when, while jogging one early morning, he ran into 200 kids still carrying on with a full-on rave from the night before. \u201cWhen you\u2019re this age, this is what it\u2019s about, man,\u201d he says, after another run, this one across the Golden Gate Bridge. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanna live forever. I don\u2019t want to f***ing die.\u201d Who knew \u201cLive Forever\u201d was a cardio anthem? Gallagher is so serious about his health that he swears, \u201cI only do two grams before I go on stage now. Whereas I used to do eight.\u201d Progress! (I think he is kidding here, but I really don\u2019t know. I respect either his forbearance or his endurance.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the doc is to be believed, Gallagher has reached stability thanks in large part to his girlfriend and manager, Debbie Gwyther, who calls him a \u201cmassive softy,\u201d albeit not without peccadilloes. \u201cYeah, he drinks too much probably from time to time,\u201d she says, \u201che gets in scrapes, he\u2019s impulsive, he says stupid things, he swears a lot, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be soft at the same time.\u201d He brings his two teenage sons on tour and seems grateful for them, and much else. \u201cConsidering all the s*** that I\u2019ve drunk and all the other stuff, you know what I mean, that people have put up my nose for me, I think my voice is half-decent,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll he wanted to be was \u201ca rock and roll singer with a bit of f***ing attitude and that is it,\u201d he says. So that worked out pretty well. While he may never get over being Noel\u2019s brother, a friend says he should let that go. After all, the friend says, \u201cKids don\u2019t want to be Noel, they want to be Liam.\u201d", "description": "Oasis front man Liam Gallagher won\u2019t look back in anger.
