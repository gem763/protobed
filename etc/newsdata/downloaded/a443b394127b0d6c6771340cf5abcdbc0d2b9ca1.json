To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.\"", "description": "More than 20 police officers are reported to have raided headquarters of the Bulgarian Football Union in Sofia", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Sportal.Bg", "Reuters", "Andy Commins", "Daily Mirror", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585403.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-15-at-152937.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
