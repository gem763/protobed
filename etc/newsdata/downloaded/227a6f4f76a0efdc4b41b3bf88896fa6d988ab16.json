There is no lack of beautiful words.\"\n\nBut she said Nordic energy consumption told \"a whole other story\".\n\nShe referenced a report from from WWF and the Global Footprint Network, which says Sweden, along with most of the Nordic region, lives as if the world has the resources of four planets.\n\nThe gap between what science said was needed to limit a global temperature increase and what was being implemented was \"gigantic\", said Ms Thunberg.\n\n\"We belong to the countries that have the possibility to do the most. And yet our countries still basically do nothing,\" she added.\n\nThe Nordic Council encourages co-operation between parliaments in countries including Denmark, Finland and Ms Thunberg's home country Sweden.", "description": "She turned down the prize money and said \"the climate movement does not need any more awards\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/169B3/production/_109459529_gretat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
