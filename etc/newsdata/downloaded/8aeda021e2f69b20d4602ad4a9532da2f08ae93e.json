After delivering a quarter percentage point cut in July, the Fed is to slash rates again at the upcoming Sept. 17-18 meeting.\n\nThe central bank's path to lower interest rates means bond yields, which compete directly with dividend paying stocks, won\u2019t be offering attractive returns as yields continue to sink. As such, any short-term capital risk inherent in buying high quality equities that also pay a dividend is offset by the logic of betting on dividend payers that have a history of producing solid income. Altria Group (NYSE: ) is a high-yielding dividend stock that, we believe, is offering particular value in this falling rate environment:\n\nAttractive Yield; Tough Operating Environment\n\nAltria\u2019s rich 7.68% dividend yield is unquestionably attractive. The parent company of Philip Morris USA, which owns such high-profile brands as Marlboro, Skoal and Nat Sherman, cigarette maker Altria has lost a quarter of its value over the past 12 months as new government regulations and declining adult consumption of traditional tobacco products damaged the company\u2019s growth potential.\n\nWith that downward move, however, the company\u2019s dividend yield has become extremely appealing. At 7.68%, its annual yield is much higher than the company\u2019s five-year growth average of 4.21%.\n\nMO Weekly 2016-2019\n\nThe bearish spell that pressured Altria shares over the past two years, seems to have run its course after news of a potential merger between Philip Morris International (NYSE: ), which sells Marlboro cigarettes in overseas markets, with Altria was released.\n\nBoth companies, which last week confirmed the merger talks, will benefit if the unification materializes, more than 10 years after the tobacco giants split their operations. The biggest advantage that analysts see will come from the unification of the most popular smoking alternative products that both companies have invested in heavily.\n\nPhilip Morris has been spending huge sums promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions outside the U.S. Altria, on the other hand, has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc. in December, to acquire a major stake in the company which has, in just a short time, captured the biggest share of alternatives to smoking market in the U.S.\n\nThose who favor the deal argue that products stand to benefit from global integration and distribution. As Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a recent note, this move \u201cwould make a lot of sense, especially now given Altria\u2019s stake in Juul and IQOS coming to market shortly in the U.S.\u201d He added that the combined company would have a \u201cstronger and more predictable/stable cash flow profile.\u201d\n\nBesides the obvious benefit of this potential merger, Altria is also active in the fast growing cannabis industry. In last December, Altria paid $1.8 billion for a 45% stake in Canadian cannabis company, Cronos Group (NASDAQ: ), one of the nation's largest marijuana producers, with a footprint in many countries and increasing production capabilities.\n\nWith its existing 10% stake in Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE: ), the largest beer producer in the world, along with its sizeable positions in both Juul and Cronos, Altria is a good long-term bet, especially when its dividend yield is at a multiyear high.\n\nOver the past decade, Altria has consistently delivered high single-digit percentage hikes to its quarterly payout. The company now pays an $0.84 a share dividend every three months, a sum that has grown every year over the past 49 years.\n\nBottom Line\n\nHigh yielding stocks, such as Altria, certainly carry added risks. The tobacco company is facing a more stringent regulatory environment in the U.S., at a time when its tobacco sales are on a perpetual downslide.\n\nThat being said, the company is aggressively diversifying its revenue base to meet that challenge. The recent merger initiative with Phillip Morris International will add additional strength to its business. In our view, the timing is right for investors to buy Altria) shares, if they're interested in adding value to their portfolios.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Haris Anwar/Investing.com covering: Philip Morris International Inc, Altria Group, Anheuser Busch Inbev NV ADR, Cronos Group Inc.
