After months of rehearsing his election strategy, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is poised to run a high-risk campaign designed to exploit divisions over Brexit despite his public appeals for national unity.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is seen in Downing Street, October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nAhead of the Dec. 12 vote, he will focus on portraying his new Brexit deal with the European Union as a victory for a leader who many said would be unable to win concessions from Brussels and would instead leave without an agreement.\n\nCentral to the election campaign will be the message that only Johnson can finish the job of leaving the EU, two sources close to the campaign said.\n\nIt is a stance the former foreign minister and London mayor has used with varying degrees of success since becoming prime minister in July, after his predecessor failed three times get parliament to approve her own Brexit deal.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal secured initial parliamentary approval, though its passage remains uncertain. In the election, he hopes to win a parliamentary majority - something he does not currently enjoy - to push the agreement through.\n\nTo win the election, rather than uniting the people, one source said, Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party wants to tap into divisions over the EU, hoping to fire up voters who backed leaving by offering them an early taste of the so-called \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d - for example, funding promised for healthcare from savings generated by quitting the EU.\n\nIt is a narrative that pits those who back Brexit against the \u201cestablishment\u201d - parliament, the courts and big business - which Johnson says is trying to frustrate the \u201cwill of the people\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the outsiders versus the insiders,\u201d said one veteran party member.\n\nIt involves making a play for English regions which traditionally vote for the opposition Labour Party but also back leaving the EU, in order to counter a challenge from the Brexit Party led by veteran eurosceptic Nigel Farage.\n\nAccording to one source, the party will focus on around 40 constituencies, or voting districts, in central and northern England which voted to leave the EU.\n\nAnother Conservative campaigner said highly effective social media campaigning used in the 2016 referendum was also being deployed - resulting in one lawmaker being contacted by 200 voters he did not have in his database.\n\nGAMBLE\n\nJohnson looks to be in a strong position, leading in opinion polls and with much higher personal ratings than his main opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nBut waging a Brexit election is also a risky move - Johnson could deepen divisions in the Conservatives and is betting on widening the party\u2019s appeal in a country where traditional political allegiances have been shattered by the 2016 decision.\n\nHis predecessor, Theresa May, called an election two years ago when riding high in opinion polls, only to be handed a hung parliament by voters who were unconvinced by an ill-judged campaign.\n\nWith polling day only announced on Tuesday, neither party has yet produced manifestos, which will offer a deeper understanding of their strategies for Britain.\n\nBut the months spent limbering up for the poll have offered an insight into how Johnson will wage what will be a short campaign before an election which will determine how, when and perhaps even whether Britain will leave the EU.\n\nAs prime minister, Johnson, a figurehead for the Vote Leave campaign in 2016, has made delivering Brexit his main focus.\n\nHe staked his reputation on \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d on Oct. 31, only to be thwarted by parliament and forced to ask for an extension to his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline.\n\nBut one source in his team said Johnson could weather reneging on that pledge.\n\nFocus groups, the source said, suggest that voters will see that he is trying to deliver on his Brexit promise and is being prevented from doing so by parliament.\n\n\u201cThe strategy is to woo Brexit Party supporters of all colours, but specifically court Labour leave voters in the northeast and Midlands,\u201d the veteran Conservative member said. The message is \u201clet\u2019s get Brexit done and move on.\u201d", "description": "The phoney war is over.
