With rain pouring down, the margin of error was slim for both teams as neither of them could move the ball with ease.\n\nBut undefeated teams like the San Francisco 49ers find ways to win games when the conditions aren\u2019t ideal.\n\nAnd lower-tier teams like the Washington Redskins typically tend to blow them.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened Sunday as the Redskins dropped a 9-0 loss to the 49ers, falling to 1-6 on the season. San Francisco (6-0) needed just three field goals and held Washington to 154 yards.\n\nDue to the miserable conditions, the Redskins relied excessively on the run. Running back Adrian Peterson took seven straight carries to begin the game and Washington didn\u2019t attempt a pass until there was 7:35 left in the first quarter.\n\nEven with the run-heavy approach, the Redskins had success. Wendell Smallwood, filling in for the injured Chris Thompson, gashed San Francisco\u2019s defense for 17 yards. Peterson, on second-and-18, broke through for 13 yards.\n\nBut the Redskins\u2018 drive stalled out just outside the red zone \u2014 with kicker Dustin Hopkins missing a 39-yard field goal.\n\nSan Francisco, though, couldn\u2019t take advantage of Washington\u2019s miss. Like the Redskins, the 49ers avoided throwing the ball. Entering Sunday, the 49ers, with Kyle Shanahan\u2019s zone-based blocking scheme, were one of the league\u2019s most-efficient rushing attacks \u2014 averaging 179.8 yards per game.\n\nThe Redskins stayed disciplined in their assignments. By the end of the first, San Francisco\u2019s longest rush was just 11 yards \u2014 coming off a quarterback scramble from Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nThe 49ers, too, were a mess offensively. Robbie Gould shanked a 45-yard attempt, sailing it wide left.\n\nBut Washington missed another key chance later on. Facing fourth-and-1 from their own 29-yard line, Peterson was swallowed up in the backfield, resulting in a turnover on downs.\n\nAt halftime, with both teams scoreless, San Francisco had just five net passing yards. They were the fewest the Redskins held an opponent to in the first half since 1996, when Dallas had minus-7 passing yards.\n\nIn the second half, the Redskins continued to miss their chances. Reserve safety Troy Apke, who entered the game after Montae Nicholson exited with an ankle injury, picked off Garoppolo on San Francisco\u2019s opening drive, but Washington immediately squandered it by going three-and-out.\n\nLater on, Garoppolo found wide receiver Richie James Jr. for a 40-yard gain. It was the 49ers\u2019 biggest play of the afternoon \u2014 and it turned out to be enough. The reception put San Francisco in field goal range and Gould knocked in a 28-yard attempt to give the 49ers a 3-0 lead.\n\nTrying to answer back, the Redskins moved the ball down the field. Quarterback Case Keenum connected with Jeremy Sprinkle and Trey Quinn, the latter of whom hauled in a 19-yard grab and slid out of bounds.\n\nBut just outside the red zone, Peterson then fumbled the ball \u2014 ending a promising drive.\n\nGould then scored a 22-yard field goal, making the 6-0 lead feel insurmountable. It was.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
