Chances are you'll be rewarded with an unexpected encounter of the artistic kind.\n\nIt may be a mural glimpsed from a passing window, a multi-coloured passageway or an entrance adorned with silvery leaves \u2014 it all depends on your perspective.\n\nThe city invested $7 million to bestow a unique character on each of the new LRT line's 13 stations, and 22 artists from the area and across the country answered the call.\n\nLook up, way up\n\nTo take in some of the stunning installations along the Confederation Line, commuters may need to tilt their heads up. Several of the commissioned artworks are displayed high above.\n\nAt Tunney's Pasture station, light streams through the huge, multi-hued skylight, splashing colour across the walls and floor. Vancouver artist Derek Root envisions his Radiant Space as animating the daily commute.\n\n\"I really wanted to activate the environment with colour and texture,\" Root said.\n\nA field of silver flowers dangles from the walkway overhang between Tremblay station and Ottawa's Via Rail station, casting shimmering floral shapes underfoot.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nT\u200boronto artist Jyhling Lee's said she wants her National Garden installation to change with the weather.\n\n\"The flowers will waver in the wind, create shadows on the ground,\" Lee said, standing beneath her garden in the sky.\n\n\"The piece will be constantly changing because of its capacity to reflect and take in the surrounding environment.\"\n\nHigh above the platform at Pimisi station, 100 hand-painted paddles hang arranged in the shape of a canoe.\n\nM\u00e0mawi is the work of Algonquin artist Simon Brascoup\u00e9, who made sure each paddle tells its own story, drawn from Anishinaabe culture.\n\nDon't miss the vibrant ceiling at Parliament station, a cubist homage to Tom Thomson's iconic painting The Jack Pine, from artist and author Douglas Coupland.\n\nA seat with a view\n\nSome art is best viewed from the comfort of your seat.\n\nLocal artist Adrian G\u00f6llner's As the Crow Flies is an undulating installation of tubular steel and fencing best appreciated from a passing train at Bayview station. The 120-metre line drawing suggests the topography of the Gatineau Hills and rooftops of Mechanicsville as it mimics a crow's flightpath.\n\n\"It wiggles and warbles and goes up and down as you go in and out of the station,\" said G\u00f6llner, who hopes commuters can pry themselves from their cell phones to gaze instead out the window as their train rolls by.\n\n\"Maybe this will get their heads up,\" G\u00f6llner said.\n\nA garden grows deep within the tunnels of Parliament station. Common plants and enduring weeds climb along laser-cut steel panels designed by New Brunswick-based artist Jennifer Stead.\n\nStead hopes this injection of green will temper the concrete surroundings and remind travellers of the diversity that sprouts from Canadian soil.\n\n\"We're a growing country and we have people from everywhere, and they tend to get along,\" Stead said.\n\nUnexpected encounters\n\nFirst-time users of the LRT may be too busy getting their bearings to take notice of the art that surrounds them, but it's there, sometimes in the unlikeliest of places.\n\nSubtle patterns line the escalators climbing the levels of Rideau station. The shape this takes to get to that is Toronto artist Jim Verburg's first attempt at a public art installation.\n\n\"It's kind of odd, because if it's an art show of my work, people who go are very invested and they want to see it,\" Verburg said as he watched oblivious commuters pass by his muted arrangement of porcelain tiles and steel rods.\n\n\"You might not know it's an artwork at first,\" he acknowledged.\n\nGlossy murals alive with the figures of man and beast tower over travellers on the westbound platform at St-Laurent station. They're the work of Chelsea, Que., artist Andrew Morrow, and they tell stories that invite close examination.\n\nIn the light-infused environment of Blair station, glittering screens of glass hover along the stairwells and tracks, swaying gently as trains come and go.\n\nLightscape, a whimsical and imaginative addition to any commute, is designed by local artist cj fleury and Montreal-based Catherine Widgery.\n\nAccording to the city, the artists were inspired both \"by the sunrise\" and by the station's proximity to the National Research Council, just down Blair Road.", "description": "First-time users of the LRT may be too busy getting their bearings\u00a0to take notice of the art that surrounds them, but it's there, sometimes in the unlikeliest of\u00a0places.", "authors": ["Sandra Abma Is A Veteran Cbc Arts Journalist.
