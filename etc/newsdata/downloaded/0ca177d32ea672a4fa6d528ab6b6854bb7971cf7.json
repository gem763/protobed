AP\n\nThe message, written by William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, suggested that Trump was holding back a $US391 million ($581 million) package of military aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip to influence the country's president to do his political bidding.\n\n\"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor wrote in the message, which was exchanged with Volker and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, according to people who reviewed it and insisted on anonymity to describe it.\n\nBut Sondland took issue with that interpretation, writing in response, \"The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quos of any kind.\" He then suggested the conversation move to phone rather than text.\n\nThe exchange emerged as congressional investigators met privately for more than nine hours on Capitol Hill with Volker, who is the first witness in their growing impeachment inquiry into whether Trump tried to bend US policy for his own political benefit, by pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and other Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the president has openly admitted that he wanted Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, a crucial question has been whether Trump tried to use the security aid as leverage. The money was delayed until the Trump administration released it last month amid a bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.\n\nIn his text, Sondland added, \"The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\"\n\nWas he or wasn't he? The impeachment inquiry is trying to ascertain if US President Donald Trump, pictured with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York last month, sought to trade political help for aid. AP\n\nIt was not immediately clear what led Taylor to conclude that Trump was withholding aid as leverage over Ukraine. When the texts were sent in early September, news reports about the delay in releasing the aid and about attempts by Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and other Democrats had already prompted public speculation that Trump was engaging in a quid pro quo.\n\nVolker, a former ambassador to NATO, has not been accused of directly taking part in Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine. But he appears to have been caught up in efforts by the president and Giuliani to enlist Ukrainian leaders to unearth damaging information about his rivals.\n\nVolker's name appears several times in an anonymous CIA whistleblower complaint that set off the impeachment inquiry, and Giuliani has said publicly he briefed Volker on his efforts. The complaint centres on a July call Trump had with Zelensky, in which he pressed him to investigate Biden, and asserts that Volker advised the Ukrainians on how to \"navigate\" Trump's demands.\n\nInvestigators for the House Intelligence Committee wanted to know what Volker knew, and when, about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, the president's decision to withhold security assistance from the country at the same time he was pressing for investigations of Democrats, and the Trump administration's decision to recall Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was targeted by the president and Giuliani for ostensibly being insufficiently loyal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother key avenue of inquiry for investigators was the US delegation that visited Kyiv for Zelensky's inauguration, which included Volker; Sondland; Republican Senator Ron Johnson, and Rick Perry, the energy secretary. House investigators also had questions about the message officials delivered to the new government.\n\nThe interview, which Volker participated in voluntarily, took place out of public view. The text exchange was part of a trove of more than 60 pages of documents, many of them texts, that Volker provided before he arrived.\n\nVolker resigned Friday from his part-time, unpaid State Department post without public explanation. A person familiar with his thinking said the longtime diplomat concluded he could no longer be effective in the post in light of the unfolding scandal. But the resignation also freed him to appear before House investigators without restrictions, according to people familiar with his account.\n\nAs special envoy for Ukraine, Volker was a central figure in the administration's diplomacy with the country. He has told colleagues that he was not involved in the pressure campaign, and was only trying to prod the new president to stick to his campaign promises of fighting corruption, people familiar with his account said.\n\nVolker has also told friends and colleagues that he believed that the Trump administration was withholding aid to Ukraine because of generalised concerns about corruption, rather than to force a specific investigation of the Biden family, according to a person familiar with his account.\n\nBut Volker did know about Giuliani's interest in having Ukrainians investigate Biden, the person said. The two discussed it at a meeting that Giuliani has said took place in July, according to people familiar with his account. On Thursday, Volker told congressional investigators that he had informed Giuliani he considered the allegations against the Bidens to be baseless, people familiar with his testimony said.\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint said that a day after Trump spoke with Zelensky in July, Volker and Sondland met with Zelensky and other political figures in person. The whistleblower said that multiple US officials told him the two Americans gave \"advice\" to the Ukrainians \"about how to navigate the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelensky\".\n\nThe complaint also said that the two men had tried to \"contain the damage\" to US national security posed by the scheme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe session with Volker was the first in what is expected to be a fast-paced series of interviews in the coming weeks, when Democrats aim to bring a parade of witnesses behind closed doors for questioning. Yovanovitch is expected to appear next week.\n\nOther State Department diplomats, including Sondland and associates of Giuliani's, are scheduled to participate as well, but it remains to be seen whether they will appear voluntarily. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the committee this week that its requests were inappropriately aggressive and untenable.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Texts turned over by the first witness quizzed by the impeachment inquiry suggests officials were split over whether Trump tried to use security aid as leverage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3125%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_120/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d09564a924a554d7c4689d0be9558350212c9f48", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
