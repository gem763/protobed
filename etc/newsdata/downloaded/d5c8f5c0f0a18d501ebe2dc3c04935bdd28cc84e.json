(Reuters) - Barcelona secured a much-needed 2-1 home victory over Villarreal in La Liga on Tuesday, racing into a two-goal lead inside 15 minutes before hanging on after Santi Cazorla halved the deficit on the stroke of halftime.\n\nBarcelona's Antoine Griezmann in action with Villarreal's Andre Zambo Anguissa REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nThe victory takes Barcelona up to fourth with 10 points after six games, one point behind surprise leaders Granada, Athletic Bilbao, who visit Leganes on Wednesday, and Real Madrid ahead of their game at home to Osasuna the same night.\n\nBarca\u2019s win was marred by the sight of Lionel Messi, making his first start this season, receiving lengthy treatment before being replaced at halftime by Ousmane Dembele in what coach Ernesto Valverde insisted was a precautionary measure.\n\n\u201cHe noticed a little bit of an issue with his adductor and we preferred for him not to stay on the pitch, but it was just a precaution,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any more than just a niggle but we\u2019ll need to wait for tomorrow to confirm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are playing well at home, but I think with the injury to Leo everyone was stopped in their tracks a little bit.
