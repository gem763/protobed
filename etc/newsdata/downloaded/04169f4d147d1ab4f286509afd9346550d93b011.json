It has also pledged to review its lifetime membership policy, and appointed five members to its selection committee from outside the body.\n\nSeven new members have been appointed and a respected literature professor, Mats Malm, took over as permanent secretary in June after the resignation of his predecessor Sara Danius. But the Nobel Foundation, which funds the literary world\u2019s most prestigious, $914,000 prize, said the academy still needed to do more.\n\n\u201cI think they can, and to some extent they have already begun doing so, act more openly than they have done in the past and I think that would be a good thing,\u201d said Lars Heikensten, executive director of the Nobel Foundation, who only gave the academy the green light to crown a laureate in 2019 this May.\n\n\u201cOur reputation is everything,\u201d Heikensten said. \u201cObviously, it is important to avoid this kind of situation we have been in and of course it cannot be repeated.\u201d A Swedish literary critic, Madeleine Levy, told Agence-France Presse: \u201cThe Nobel prize is for many now associated with #MeToo ... and a dysfunctional organisation.\u201d\n\nWith at least one of the laureates almost certain to be a woman, the Polish writers Olga Tokarczuk and Hanna Krall, South Korean writer Han Kang, Joyce Carol Oates of the US and the Russian novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya are also being mentioned. Only 14 of the 114 laureates since 1901 have been women. Also thought to be in with a chance is the Romanian novelist Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu.\n\nPrevious winners of the prize include Bob Dylan (2016), Alice Munro (2013), Orhan Pamuk (2006), Toni Morrison (2003) and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1982). One academy member, Anders Olsson, said the committee had looked for a more diverse shortlist this year and tried to move away away from \u201cmale-oriented\u201d and \u201cEurocentric perspective of literature\u201d.", "description": "Atwood and Murakami among favourites for prize as academy tries to rebuild its reputation", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7efe2258088d06ec64801330a38892a3276c3032/0_56_2024_1214/master/2024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cc6aa1446c8bd4fb0e1b651159837427", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
