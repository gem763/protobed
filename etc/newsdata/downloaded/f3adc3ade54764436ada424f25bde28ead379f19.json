Sorry I won't right this it's rood.\"\n\nThe pupil from Utah, who was initially worried about how her teacher would respond, then wrote a letter to explain why she didn't want to solve the problem, as reported by Today .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude but I don\u2019t think that math problem was very nice because that\u2019s judging people\u2019s weight,\" she said.\n\n\u201cAlso the reason I did not do the sentence is because I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s nice. Love Rhythm.\"\n\nHer concern that the question could be damaging to young girls who may already feel insecure about their bodies flooded her parents with pride.\n\n\u201cRhythm\u2019s dad and I were extremely proud of Rhythm for listening to her gut instincts and standing up for what is right,\" said Naomi.\n\n\u201cRhythm\u2019s teacher was so responsive and handled the situation with such care. She told her she understands how she would be upset about this and that she didn\u2019t have to write out the answer.\"\n\nOthers were quick to praise the youngster, with one writing on Facebook : \u201cWay to go Rhythm! Love how strong of a person you are at a young age. This will serve you well in life.\"\n\nAnother said: \"As someone who grew up as an overweight child in the 70s I can tell you it was absolutely brutal. Zero tolerance was not a thing, kudos to this child for being sensitive to others' disabilities.\"\n\nHas your child ever surprised you with a brilliant response to their school work?
