The franchise operator, which owns Howard Johnson, is named in a $10 million lawsuit filed Tuesday in Brooklyn Federal Court\n\nChoice Hotels (pictured), based in Rockville, Maryland, which operates Econo Lodge, also was named in the $10 million suit. Choice and Wyndham both say they condemn human sex-trafficking and offer training to hotel staff on how to spot abuse\n\n'We condemn human trafficking in any form,' a Wyndham spokesman tells DailyMail.com.\n\nParsippany, New Jersey,-based Wyndham, the largest hotel chain in the world, partners with the International Tourism Partnership, End Child Prostitution and Trafficking, which fights child sex trafficking, the Polaris Project, an anti-slavery effort, and other organizations, the spokesman said, that shares the 'same values' as the lodging company.\n\n'We have worked to enhance our policies condemning human trafficking while also providing training to help our team members, as well as the hotels we manage, identify and report trafficking activities,' the spokesman told DailyMail.com\n\nA spokeswoman at the Rockville, Maryland,-based choice said the hotel company has similar partnerships with anti-human and sex-trafficking organizations, and provides staff training to spot abuse as well.\n\n'While we cannot comment on pending litigation, we are committed to conducting business free from violations of human rights,' the spokeswoman wrote in an email to DailyMail.com.\n\n'Our brand rules and regulations require franchisees to comply with all local, state and federal laws and any violation can result in the termination of their franchise agreement'.\n\nThe woman, coming forward in what the New York Post said was an unprecedented lawsuit for New York, charges Wyndham and Choice were 'complicit' in the abuse shew was forced to suffer as a child because their franchise operators chose 'to ignore the open and obvious presence of sex trafficking on their properties'.\n\nAccording to the woman's suit, she was sold for sex 15 to 20 times a day at the two New York hotel properties, starting in 2006 when she was ten, and that the abuse lasted three years until she was 13, reports the Post.\n\nA 25-year-old pimp had taken her under his care, she says in court papers, after she escaped from a foster care home where she also was sexually and physically abused.\n\nThe suit adds that the woman had entered the foster care system after her biological father had molested her.\n\nThe suit describes how the woman was lured in by the pimp.\n\n'S.J.'s trafficker took advantage of her vulnerability by preying on the young girl's normal desire for attention and approval and gaining her trust by taking her out for meals and shopping trips, and offering her life advice and the promise that she could be a part of their family,' the suit states.\n\nThe pimp, once having taken the young girl's virginity, forced her into servicing Johns. 'How you make 'Daddy' happy, is by making [them] happy,' she recalled the pimp telling her, according to court papers.\n\nShe was shuttled between the two hotels with a 'paper bag' over head and could end up being raped non-stop for days, the suit says.\n\nRooms were paid in cash.\n\nIf the pimp was short on money, staff at the Econo Lodge were allowed to partake in the sexual abuse, 'in lieu of his payment for the rooms,' the court papers show.\n\nA bowl of condoms at the front desk provided fresh supplies when needed.\n\nThere was 'constant and voluminous' foot traffic coming and going from the rooms, as well as 'numerous used condoms ... scattered across various surfaces' after each John checked out, and yet none of the activity or evidence left behind registered with staff as criminal activity, the suit alleges.\n\nThe suit alleges staff at both of hotels allowed the abuse by failing to call law enforcement.\n\nThey also ignored when the young girl and others who were victimized showed signs of physical abuse, diminished personal hygiene, that they were traveling without luggage and wore submissive and risque clothing, according to the complaint.\n\nThe woman who came forward in the suit alleges that she was sold for sex 15 to 20 times a day at two New York hotel properties, including a Howard Johnson in Jamaica, Queens.
