They\u2019d mention Joe Blow in their state who said X, or Jane Blow who called their office with Y problem. They commonly use techniques such as: \u201cThe voters I speak to aren\u2019t preoccupied with the elite concerns of Washington or New York. The voters I speak to are concerned about . . .\u201d and then the candidate fills in the policy he or she is touting.\n\nThat\u2019s okay as far as it goes, but politics by anecdote should have some limits, because, as a wag once said, \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data.\u201d Relying on anecdotes alone is how you get the anti-vaccine movement and other dangerous delusions. \u201cI knew a little boy who was totally normal and chatty until he got the MMR shot, and then he became autistic.\u201d That\u2019s tragic, but the data show that across large populations, there is no link between vaccines and autism. On the contrary, vaccines are a key public-health benefit.\n\nPoliticians owe it to us to ensure that when they use examples, they are using them to illustrate larger truths, not to mislead.\n\nElizabeth Warren fails this test. For someone who touts herself as a scholar, she resorts to anecdotes in most disingenuous fashion.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mona Charen", "Nationalreview.Com Elizabeth-Warren-Health-Care-Debate-Candidate-Knows-Stories-Are-Not-Accurate"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
