Australia slipped two spots to 16th, immediately behind France, Canada and South Korea.\n\nThe report's index maps out the competitive landscape of 141 economies based on more than 100 indicators in a dozen categories.\n\nThose categories include headings like health, financial system, market size, business dynamism and capacity to innovate.", "description": "The United States is less competitive than it was a year ago and the global economy remains hobbled by low productivity despite a decade of cheap money from central banks, the World Economic Forum says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_98/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/af632b8e8de6684e302d435a53baa92a6b544b76", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
