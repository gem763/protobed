Kyle Pred, a cadet in the Los Santos Police Department, was talking a gangster out of killing a random hostage in a bank. The gangster, Speedy, was yelling questions at Pred. \u201cHow many dots are there on two dice?\u201d he asked through the locked door. \u201c21 times two, so 42,\u201d Pred replied, correctly. The situation went on in this way for a minute, before Speedy tired of the game and brought the hostage out, along with his two men. The cops allowed them to get inside their vehicle; a merry chase ensued, ending a short while later as Speedy was able to get away on foot. (He immediately ambushed another gang with his submachine gun.)\n\nIn scripted games, as in life, much of your actions are role-playing: you act according to your character (in both senses of the word). Role-playing games, on the other hand, break the format explicitly \u2014 you define your character, and you invent the world that made them possible.\n\nOn NoPixel, the custom Grand Theft Auto V server where I happened on Pred and Speedy, the two are blended; the world already exists, a grittier copy of the one we live in, but the characters are entirely invented by their players. In practice, the result plays out as something akin to a drama scripted on the fly as players encounter each other. It is also Grand Theft Auto, which means that what you\u2019re watching is a noir: cops vs. gangsters, and then everyone else caught in the crossfire. (Its popularity has also propelled Grand Theft Auto V to near the top of the Twitch charts.)\n\nThe NoPixel role-playing universe has a constellation of websites and city services that you can actually interact with. There are journalists in this world, and they write articles about its developments. Thousands of people watch the Twitch channels this live soap is aired on \u2014 around 5,500 people were watching the hostage negotiation on Kyle\u2019s channel alone \u2014 and there is a fan wiki that keeps track of everything.\n\nNoPixel\u2019s GTA role-play is somewhat antithetical to the experience of playing Grand Theft Auto; in the game\u2019s story mode, you generally play a morally gray criminal who usually uses violence to achieve his ends. But the most important of NoPixel\u2019s strict rules \u2014 which people follow, on penalty of getting banned from the 32-person server \u2014 is that you must value your life and the lives of others; if a gun is pointed at you in the game, you\u2019re required to act accordingly \u2014 you have to decide whether to fight or flee. The NoPixel rules make it possible for a character to die forever, which means GTA\u2019s noir-ish conflicts have real stakes.\n\nEveryone in NoPixel is heavily invested in their role-play. Viewing it was simultaneously like listening to a group of people play a tabletop role-playing game and watching Law and Order, except I could flip between the gangs and the police.\n\nWhat was more disconcerting, however, was how playing by real-world rules in the game made the regular outbursts of violence weightier. Officer Kyle Pred used cop lingo. Officer Kyle Pred stopped his cruiser at every stoplight. Officer Kyle Pred didn\u2019t shoot at Speedy as he and his gang were getting into their car and driving away; he didn\u2019t even take a shot after the gang\u2019s car was totaled and Speedy had taken off on foot.\n\nThe weirdest thing about watching a law enforcement show where the cops are required to value the lives of others is just how humane they come to seem in contrast to their real-life counterparts. What would life be like, I wonder, if the police had to stop and think about consequence before they took even a fully justifiable shot?", "description": "On NoPixel, the custom Grand Theft Auto V server where I happened on Pred and Speedy, the two are blended; the world already exists, a grittier copy of the one we live in, but the characters are entirely invented by their players.
