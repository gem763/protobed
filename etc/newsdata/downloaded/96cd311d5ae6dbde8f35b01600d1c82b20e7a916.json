Guangzhou, a city of 14 million, is no stranger to the disruption brought about by breakneck economic change, and retains a strong sense of traditional identity. Once China's only port open to foreign trade, Guangzhou prides itself on being a bastion of southern Chinese culture and thought. It has thrived since China opened itself to the outside world in the late 1970s, cementing its position as one of the country\u2019s most important manufacturing hubs.\n\nNewlywed couples pose for wedding pictures on top of the Canton Tower in the Haizhu district. Wealth has transformed the city's downtown, where skyscrapers dominate the skyline. The most prominent is the 604-metre (1,980-ft) -tall Canton Tower, where newlyweds flock to shoot wedding photographs, as tourists look on.

While Xiancun's cramped streets once offered affordable homes for migrants drawn to Guangzhou's prosperity and opportunities, it is now being swept away by redevelopment. Life on the city's fringes can be hard, with house prices among China's highest and poorer elderly residents forced to sort rubbish to earn a living. Still, much of traditional life remains.\n\nWomen practise tai chi in the early morning at a park in the city's old district. Older citizens practise 'tai chi' and dance together for exercise and companionship in the public spaces. By evening, hawker stalls and small massage parlours light up dim alleys that come alive with chatter and beer drinking as friends try to beat the sultry summer heat.\n\nA man sleeps in a cart near a market in the traditional neighbourhood. Labourers lounge in pushcarts while young professionals zip by on the colourful shared bikes that crowd China's cities. But Guangzhou's economic growth has started to slow, along with the rest of the country.\n\n1 / 16 Slideshow A woman holds an umbrella as she walks outside the Opera House.
