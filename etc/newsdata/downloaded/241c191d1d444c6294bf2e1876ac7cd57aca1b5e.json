The main charge actually described a Republican.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cHey \u2026\u201d the first woman recounted a male lawmaker asking. \u201cDo your panties match your outfit?\u201d\n\nAt the end of the 58-second clip, the women\u2019s voices become one as they plead, \u201cStop Brandon Whipple.\u201d\n\nThe video\u2019s first quote came from a real story of a University of Kansas intern mistreated by a male state legislator in Topeka, Kan. But one notable detail was not in the attack ad \u2014 the intern had accused a Republican state senator, not state Rep. Whipple, a Democrat who is now running for mayor in Wichita, the state\u2019s largest city.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhipple is now suing and alleging the ad slandered him, as local reporters found that the man behind the video shares office space with two prominent Kansas Republicans.\n\nThe false ad appeared online as transparency and truthfulness in campaign ads has become a point of national concern. Facebook\u2019s controversial policy to allow candidates to post false statements in political ads without retribution has drawn ridicule from many and anger on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe misleading video also materialized amid ongoing fallout from the #MeToo movement, both in Kansas, where the state legislature has endured multiple harassment scandals, and nationally, where Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) announced she was resigning amid a messy controversy sparked by private photos allegedly leaked by her estranged husband, who she is divorcing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs first reported by the Wichita Eagle, the attack ad posted to a Facebook page and YouTube channel was paid for by a mysterious New Mexico company called Protect Wichita\u2019s Girls LLC. State business records do not say who owns the company, nor do they connect it to Kansas in any way.\n\nThe first allegation made in the video was eerily similar to a quote from a 2017 Kansas City Star report about widespread harassment of state capitol interns. Other stories the women in the video tell, of feeling uncomfortable around politicians and being asked repeatedly to be designated drivers, appear to be inspired in part by another Star story on Topeka\u2019s 2017 harassment scandal.\n\nNone of those cases involved Whipple. The Star mentions Whipple only once in those stories, to quote him saying he only recalled being driven to and from one event by an intern, who had been a man.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe one time when a male intern drove a group of us to and from an official event was shown to have nothing to do with sexual harassment,\u201d Whipple, 37, told the Eagle last week after the video first surfaced. \u201cSo, I think they\u2019re doing this because I\u2019m a young male and every time I run in a competitive race, they have attacked my family and they attack my marriage and this is just what they do.\u201d\n\nThe source of the video remained hidden behind the shell company until reporters at the Eagle managed to track down one of the actresses in the video. She told the newspaper a 21-year-old named Matthew Colborn recruited her to read the script, which she thought was for a public service announcement about domestic violence. Colborn allegedly paid her $50.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh, knowing that it\u2019s a lie now, I just feel terrible,\u201d she told The Eagle. \u201cAll I want to do is like hug the people that I\u2019ve tarred in the whole thing and just apologize, because I had no idea.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Eagle reported that Colborn, the man who allegedly produced the political smear, filmed it in a downtown Wichita office shared with two elected Republicans, state Rep. Michael Capps and Wichita City Councilman James Clendenin.\n\nClendenin acknowledged working in the building and knowing Colborn, who works as Capps\u2019s campaign manager, though he denied any association with the video.\n\n\u201cNothing like that happened while I was around,\u201d he told the Eagle. \u201cOf course, I haven\u2019t been around very much, either.\u201d\n\nCapps, Clendenin and Colborn did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nOn Tuesday, Whipple filed a lawsuit against Colborn and two \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants for defaming him in the campaign ad. The lawsuit alleges a conspiracy between Colborn and political supporters of Wichita Mayor Jeff Longwell (R).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe defendants apparently believe that they can influence an election by posting horribly false and defamatory statements about the plaintiff,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nWhipple aims to unseat Longwell. He has snagged endorsements from several labor unions, including those that represent the city\u2019s the firefighters and police officers. The Eagle\u2019s editorial board endorsed him this week as an alternative to the Republican incumbent, who has been caught steering city contracts to friends.\n\nWichita residents will cast their votes in the mayoral race on Nov. 5.\n\nAD", "description": "An attack ad used real sexual harassment allegations to malign a Democrat running for mayor in Wichita.
