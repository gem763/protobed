They exited the field, again, with opposing fans cheering \u2014 this time on the Redskins\u2019 own annual Alumni Homecoming Weekend.\n\nBy losing Sunday, the Redskins have now gone a calendar year without a win at FedEx. Their last victory came Oct. 21, 2018, when the Dallas Cowboys missed a last-second field goal to seal Washington\u2019s win.\n\nSan Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan, a former Redskins offensive coordinator, got his revenge and the Redskins were left looking for lessons learned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to learn how to \u2014 when we\u2019ve got \u2018em by the neck, choke people out,\u201d Redskins left tackle Donald Penn said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep learning. \u2026 We had a chance to really beat a good team out there.\n\n\u201cAnd they know they got lucky, but luck don\u2019t get us nowhere.\u201d\n\nLucky is certainly one way to describe it. But it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. The Redskins were limited to just 154 yards offensively. Their 50 net yards passing were their fewest since 1980.\n\nThe Redskins also squandered prime opportunities \u2014 failing to score three times in San Francisco territory.\n\nOn the first chance, the Redskins\u2019 drive stalled outside the red zone, with kicker Dustin Hopkins missing a 39-yard attempt.\n\nBehind the running of Adrian Peterson, the Redskins had marched down the field on the opening drive with 10 straight runs. But San Francisco made a stop on third down, leading to the missed kick.\n\nLater, on fourth-and-1 from the 29, rather than attempt the field goal, Washington lined up in I-formation with no receivers on the field. The plan was clear: Get the ball to Peterson. As soon as the ball was snapped, the 34-year-old was stuffed in the backfield.\n\nDown 3-0 in the third quarter, the Redskins were again at San Francisco\u2019s 29-yard line. Finally, points seemed to be in reach. Peterson, however, fumbled, with the ball slipping out as he was being dragged down by multiple defenders. San Francisco recovered.\n\n\u201cThe fumble, for me personally, that\u2019s what lost us the game,\u201d said Peterson, who finished with 81 yards on 20 carries. \u201cI always look at going on to the next play, next play. But that was a critical time. \u2026 I\u2019ll be beating myself up about this one all night I know for sure.\u201d\n\nThe loss was particularly frustrating for a franchise that a week ago had collected its first win of the season in Miami. Players dressed quickly after the game with a few declining to talk to the media. Penn snapped at a reporter when asked about Bosa\u2019s celebration.\n\nSan Francisco came into the game heavily favored, but the Redskins kept things close into the fourth quarter.\n\nLike Washington, the 49ers had trouble throwing. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo had just 151 yards and was picked off in the third quarter when safety Troy Apke came up the grab. Garoppolo was also sacked twice.\n\nThe undefeated 49ers, though, found a way to win. Garoppolo hit wide receiver Richie James Jr. for a 40-yard gain, setting up their first field goal. Kicker Robbie Gould later made it 6-0, which given the Redskins\u2019 lack of offensive production, felt insurmountable.\n\nStill, Washington had a chance. With 9:03 left and the ball at their own 25, the Redskins were a touchdown and an extra point away from taking the lead.\n\nInstead, the Redskins went three and out, San Francisco added another field goal and the 49ers celebrated by playing in the rain.\n\n\u201cWhat they do is their business, and we just didn\u2019t do enough to win,\u201d Redskins interim coach Bill Callahan said. \u201cI learned a long time ago, when you win, say little. And when you lose, say less.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve got nothing to say except take care of our own business and refocus and get ready here on a short week for Minnesota.\u201d\n\nWashington faces the Vikings, led by former Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins, on Thursday in Minnesota. Cousins went 24 of 34 for 337 yards and four touchdowns in the Vikings\u2019 42-30 win over the Detroit Lions on Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
