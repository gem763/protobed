Today a pound would buy the holder $1.29. The British currency has plainly declined an enormous amount versus the dollar since 1945, but the previous stat realistically only tells us a tiny fraction of the pound devaluation story.\n\nYou see, the dollar has similarly shrunk in cruel fashion since 1945. Figure that a dollar purchased 1/35th of an ounce of gold in 1945, but today it buys roughly 1/1500th. Hopefully this gives readers a better idea of what Britain\u2019s monetary authorities have done to the pound over the last 75 years, along with what their counterparts in the U.S. have done to the dollar.\n\nA lot of this and more came to mind while reading Martin Wolf\u2019s latest Financial Times essay on money. Routinely incoherent on the subject, readers can rest assured that Wolf\u2019s latest didn\u2019t disappoint. He scored big by reminding the self-flagellating among us who flagellate ourselves by reading him, just how little he understands money.\n\nWolf\u2019s clear intent was to discredit Facebook\u2019s noble plan to introduce a global cryptocurrency, which is known as the libra. And while he failed in his stated objective, he reminded those who endured all of his 1,000+ words how very much the world\u2019s workers need freedom from the state\u2019s control over the measure that is money, and by extension economists like Wolf whom clueless monetary authorities in search of ego enhancement blindly read.\n\nSpeaking of the state, fairly early in his column Wolf made the historically inaccurate assertion that \u201cthe state has always had oversight of money and must continue to do so.\u201d Actually, it hasn\u2019t. That Wolf thinks it has is the first sign of how little he understands money.\n\nMissed by the economist is that money has no purpose without production, and never did. None. That\u2019s why in modern times there are so few dollars in Newark, but so many in Manhattan. Applied to the country where Wolf scribbles his op-eds, there are very few pounds in Wolverhampton, but stupendous amounts in London\u2019s Chelsea. That there are endless quantities of dollars and pounds respectively in Manhattan and Chelsea isn\u2019t a coincidence, or thanks to sun spots, rather they\u2019re in abundance in both places as a consequence of the extraordinary productivity of the individuals living and working within both. Money doesn\u2019t instigate production; instead it\u2019s a consequence of it. Producers need an agreement about value to facilitate the exchange of what they produce, and money is the facilitator.\n\nSo no, the state has not \u201calways had oversight of money\u201d as Wolf laughably contends. As opposed to money having been a creation of the state, it was a logical effect of production. Producers needed an agreement about value that would enable exchange among producers, so \u201cmoney\u201d came into the picture. And given our need to trade the fruits of our labor, which is an outgrowth of our desire to not live as the cave dwellers did millennia ago, money would be abundant in the U.S., England, and anywhere else there\u2019s production even if the state compassionately abdicated its present monetary role. If we\u2019re realistic, there would in fact we be a lot more money, money that is much more trusted by producers, absent the state. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nFor now, Wolf is flamboyantly incorrect in his contention that the state has \u201calways had oversight of money.\u201d A more realistic assertion for Wolf would have been that money has existed as long as producers realized life would be infinitely better if they divided up work while exchanging the surplus from same, after which the state entered the picture only to cruelly pervert money. See the dollar and pound since 1945 for one example, and of course there are sadly many, many more examples of governments inserting themselves into the money system only to confiscate, clip and otherwise destabilize what is an agreed upon measure of value minus the grasping hand of the state.\n\nThe state\u2019s role, in truth, was to bring uncertainty and much worse to the measure. And to massively shrink trust in the measure. If anyone doubts the previous assertion, try buying real goods and services in Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela with rial, won, and bolivar. Lots of luck to you. The state that Wolf so venerates has surely had \u201coversight of money\u201d in the aftermath of market actors creating it, and the results have been disastrous. That the dollar and pound are so globally accepted as exchange measures despite their stunning debasement over the last 75 years loudly tells readers how bad of a job the state has done. And by extension, how ostentatiously wrong Wolf is.\n\nAs the mildly sapient can likely imagine, Wolf aimed to make a case for government oversight of money given his desire to discredit the libra. He claims it and other cryptocurrencies represent \u201clousy architecture,\u201d after which he hides behind the Fed\u2019s Lael Brainard, and her comment that crypto money has often \u201cexhibited extreme volatility.\u201d Brainard is right about cryptocurrency volatility, but that\u2019s just a sign that money concepts like Bitcoin are anything but. Bitcoin is a speculation, which means it isn\u2019t money. Money in correct form is a low-entropy, stable measure of value. Nothing more, nothing less. Still, when Wolf hides behind Brainard, he does so while ignoring that the \u201cextreme volatility\u201d which defines certain misnamed crypto \u201ccurrencies\u201d is merely a sign that certain wannabe money forms will fail precisely because they mimic money so inexpertly overseen by the state.\n\nWolf then drools that cryptocurrencies are \u201can anarchistic fantasy,\u201d which is Wolf reminding us yet again how little he understands money. Indeed, to reduce private money to an \u201canarchistic fantasy\u201d is the equivalent of the FT columnist yelling in front the Bureau of Weights and Measures for defining a foot as twelve inches, and a pound as 16 ounces. Missed by Wolf is that money, in its correct form, quite simply is. It\u2019s just a measure. So while the vast majority of cryptocurrencies have no chance (at least in present form) of replacing state money precisely because they exhibit state-managed money\u2019s worst features, let\u2019s not be blind to the why behind cryptomoney. It\u2019s not to facilitate terrorism and drug trafficking as Wolf so obnoxiously bloviates, but instead it\u2019s a reaction to the state\u2019s persistent intervention in the oversight of money for hundreds of years, and the disastrous consequences of that intervention.\n\nSimply put, producers create goods and services, and they want to get back goods and services roughly equal in value to what they produce. What Wolf sneeringly refers to as \u201cstablecoin\u201d is in fact a market response to this entirely reasonable desire among producers to get back value equal to what they bring to market. Naturally all of this is lost on Wolf, along with the economists hiding behind tenure and government jobs whom Wolf oddly venerates. And mimics.\n\nMimic is apt simply because Wolf, expertly filling his role as prominent central banker jock sniffer, misunderstands money in the exact same way that central bankers and monetary authorities do. Like them, Wolf doesn\u2019t get that no one trades \u201cmoney\u201d in any kind of real sense. Instead, we trade goods and services for goods and services; money yet again the value agreement used by producers as a referee of sorts that speeds up the exchange. Just the same, no one really buys bonds as much as they buy what the income streams that bonds represent can command in the marketplace. Money flows are always and everywhere a consequence of actual goods, services and labor moving around countries, and around the world. This truth may help readers understand why dollars, euros and Japanese yen are collectively traded by the trillions on a daily basis, but the volume of rial, won and bolivar trade amounts to near nothing. Money is yet again a consequence of production, and exchange of that production, not an instigator. Is this basic truth lost on Wolf? Such a question is rhetorical.\n\nWith the libra in mind, Wolf contends that \u201cFacebook has not proved itself worthy of trust, to put it mildly.\u201d Is he serious? Once again, the question is rhetorical.\n\nBack to a reality that Wolf is rather separated from, Facebook meets the needs of over 2.7 billion of the world\u2019s inhabitants who eagerly joined the network, while billions of the world\u2019s inhabitants deal with government as little as possible, all the while risking jail time (or worse) if they avoid its tax collectors altogether. Yet Wolf claims Facebook is the entity we shouldn't trust in comparison to government? Oh dear...\n\nAfter that, Facebook provides us with endless joy, a social network that frees us to connect with old friends, new friends, and mere acquaintances around the world. Such a service must cost a lot of money, right? Actually it\u2019s free. Facebook only \u201ccharges\u201d its users by aiming to learn more about them, and helping other businesses learn about them, so that they can more expertly meet user needs.\n\nAs for the state which Wolf apparently trusts quite a bit more, it routinely devalues our work through currency debasement, forces us to accept services we don\u2019t want, then provides other \u201cservices\u201d to others while leaving us with the bill. And if we don\u2019t want to pay the bill? The result is jail time; the latter often preceded by the flashing of loaded guns.\n\nSo no, Facebook is nothing like government. And people the world over clearly trust it exponentially more than they do government. The same will be true of the libra unless politicians backed by the power to destroy, and economists backed by fallacy, harass the libra out of existence. How unfortunate if so.\n\nIndeed, while it\u2019s shooting fish in the most crowded of barrels to talk about the state\u2019s horrendously awful oversight of money over the centuries, Facebook\u2019s libra is a humanitarian response to the state\u2019s tragic oversight that has robbed so many billions of their work, and the people in all too many countries of the prosperity that quality money can enable precisely because it facilitates the trade and investment without which there is no progress. Facebook\u2019s global reach gives those who\u2019ve long suffered the agony of devaluation the chance to denominate their wealth in something else that, if devalued, would rather instantaneously push Facebook out of the currency game. With good reason.\n\nYou see, a business would never openly rob its customers in the way that monetary authorities backed by the state have with great constancy. Facebook must oversee a stable currency, one that is an improvement on the dollar, euro, yen and other relatively credible currencies that it plans to peg the libra to. Precisely because they haven\u2019t always been trustworthy, the libra\u2019s peg plainly won\u2019t exist without tweaking with an eye on enhanced stability as a measure of value.\n\nFor the libra to succeed, it must improve on the dollar and other currencies issued by the state. In short, Facebook will come to the rescue of workers around the world, and in the process give them a chance to escape the inept state that so impresses Wolf.\n\nMartin Wolf just gave Mark Zuckerberg and David Marcus serious \u201cbulletin board\u201d material.
