It was something I shouldn\u2019t have done because it hurt people.\n\nJustin Trudeau appeared on Facebook Watch series \u2018New Mom, Who Dis?\u2019 (Picture: New Mom, Who Dis?)\n\nHe apologised for his actions to the girls (Picture: New Mom, Who Dis?)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not something that you should do and that is something that I learned. I didn\u2019t know it back then and I know it now, and I\u2019m sorry that I hurt people.\u2019\n\nThe girls then persisted with their questioning, asking again: \u2018But did you paint your nose and your hands brown?\u2019\n\nShocking moment pilot batters his coworker after they broke up\n\nNodding, Trudeau replied: \u2018Mmm-hmm. Yeah. And it was the wrong thing to do.\u2019\n\nTrudeau has recently come under fire after evidence of three separate instances in which he had dressed in brownface came to light.\n\nOne image showed the prime minister wearing dark make up to a party at a private school he had been teaching at in 2001.\n\nA picture of him dressed in brownface at a school function emerged (Picture: AP)\n\nThe video was filmed during the early 1990s (Picture: Global News)\n\nPrinted in the school yearbook, it was taken at an Arabian Nights-themed event, when Trudeau was 29.\n\nAnother image reveals Trudeau wearing brown makeup to sing Jamaican folk song Day O while in a high school talent show.\n\nA third video, shot in the early 1990s, shows him making faces while covered in dark make up, wearing a T-shirt and ripped jeans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his apology for images, Trudeau said: \u2018Darkening your face, regardless of the context or circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface.\n\n\u2018I should have understood that then and I never should have done it.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
