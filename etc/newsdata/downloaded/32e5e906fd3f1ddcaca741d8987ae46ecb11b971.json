In other words, spend, spend, spend.\n\nWhat a contrast with a few years ago, when the focus was on cuts.\n\nThe Conservatives argue that is because the public finances can now support a new approach.\n\nBut vast uncertainty still swirls around Brexit - and what it might mean for the national balance sheet.\n\nSince the start of this conference, the party has fleshed out details on how it will spend more than \u00a350bn.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid will later make his contribution to this tally with promises on roads, buses and broadband.\n\n'Decade of renewal'\n\nThe Tories have so far made spending vows of more than \u00a350bn at their conference.\n\nIn his speech later, the chancellor will say the full benefits of the infrastructure investment \"may not be felt for some time\", but: \"The work must start here and now.\"\n\nThe first projects to be funded by the \u00a325bn pot will be:\n\nCompleting the dualling of the A66 Trans-Pennine expressway and the A46 Newark bypass\n\nImproving the M60 Simister Island interchange in Manchester\n\nStarting construction on the A428 to improve journeys between Cambridge and Milton Keynes and widening the A12 in east England\n\nAt least \u00a35bn will also be set aside to maintain and renew other strategic roads in the same period.\n\nThe chancellor will also renew his pledge from the spending round earlier this month to invest \u00a3220m into a improved bus services in England, including \u00a350m for the country's first all-electric bus town or city.\n\nHe will also set a goal for contactless payments to be made available on every city bus.\n\nAnd plans for so-called superbus networks, where local authorities will invest in bus lanes in exchange for more services from operators, will be announced. A pilot is planned for Cornwall in 2020.\n\nMr Javid is expected to say: \"Investment in our infrastructure will be key to making the next decade one of renewal - boosting our economy and making life easier for people all across the country.\n\n\"This new multi-billion pound investment to deliver gigabit-capable broadband for all the UK and investment in roads and buses will help people to get around and businesses to grow, ensuring no community is left behind.\n\n\"This will make the UK a better place to live and work, extending opportunity and raising living standards for all.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Sajid Javid arrived at conference on Sunday\n\nThe digital infrastructure will also get a boost, with the \u00a35bn investment to support the roll-out of gigabit-capable internet, and mobile networks - including 5G.\n\nThe ambition is to rollout connectivity to the hardest to reach 20% of the country - upping the earlier target of 10%. However, a deadline to reach this goal has not been confirmed.\n\nDigital Secretary Nicky Morgan said: \"Our rural communities are a thriving hotbed of industry and technology and for them resilient digital connectivity is vital.\n\n\"Our country's digital infrastructure is essential to our future economic growth and productivity and we want everyone in the UK to benefit from world-class connectivity no matter where they live or work.\"\n\nBut Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the Tories of only offering \"a combination of re-announcements and damp squibs\".\n\nHe added the announcement showed \"the real difference between the parties, saying the Tories were tinkering around the edges, while Labour was proposing a fundamental shift of power and wealth from the few to the many\".\n\nIn another announcement, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will pledge to create a simpler planning system to speed up the building of new homes.\n\nThe pledge is a continuation of the work done by his predecessor in the role, James Brokenshire, which will include making it easier for families to extend their homes, for small developers to face lighter planning system requirements and for a new route for redeveloping disused commercial buildings.\n\nMr Jenrick said: \"The bold changes to the planning process will make a real difference to people up and down the nation.\"", "description": "Infrastructure plans to be set out at the Tory conference as opposition MPs meet to discuss Brexit moves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B222/production/_109020654_mediaitem109020653.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
