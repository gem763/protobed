It was always a mystery to me.\n\nNow I know. Now that he\u2019s the president and I\u2019m watching it all unfold much more closely, I know. It\u2019s called lie and make it up.\n\nFirst: Just keep lying\u2014never, ever, ever stop lying. Because if you admit something once, you\u2019ve given up the game. So, Trump says: All 16 or however many of those women are harlots and hustlers who are out for money. He won\u2019t say, \u201cOh, maybe I did kiss this one.\u201d That would just put a crack in the facade, and once there\u2019s a crack, there\u2019s another, and another.", "description": "We know what they\u2019re doing to democracy.
