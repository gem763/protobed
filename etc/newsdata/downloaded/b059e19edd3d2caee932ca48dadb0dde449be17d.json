He has been viewed as a beacon for liberals in the Trump era, even appearing on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine under the headline \u201cWhy Can\u2019t He Be Our President?\u201d\n\nPerhaps sensing Trudeau is in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president in urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and saying the world needs his progressive leadership now.\n\nBut old photos of Trudeau in blackface and brownface surfaced last month, casting doubt on his judgment.\n\nTrudeau also was hurt by a scandal that erupted this year when his former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs, but the damage gave a boost to the Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer.\n\nNo party is expected to get a majority of Parliament\u2019s 338 seats, so a shaky alliance may be needed to pass legislation.\n\nIf Conservatives should win the most seats \u2014 but not a majority \u2014 they would probably try to form a government with the backing of Quebec\u2019s separatist Bloc Quebecois party. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals would likely rely on the New Democrats to stay in power.\n\nScheer is a career politician described by those in his own party as bland, a possible antidote for those tired of Trudeau\u2019s flash. Scheer, 40, calls Trudeau a phony who can\u2019t even recall how many times he has worn blackface.\n\nJason Kenney, Alberta\u2019s premier and a close friend of Scheer, calls the Conservative leader \u201can extremely normal Canadian\u201d who is so nice he \u201ccan\u2019t fake being mean.\u201d\n\nScheer, however, has so relentlessly attacked Trudeau that Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster, said he hasn\u2019t been himself.\n\n\u201cScheer has been hostage to the message,\u201d Nanos said. \u201cHis campaign has made him into an attack machine.\u201d\n\nConservative supporters chanted \u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d at a rally Saturday after Scheer said he would investigate Trudeau\u2019s attorney general scandal \u2014 mirroring the Hillary Clinton \u201cLock her up!\u201d chant popular at Donald Trump rallies. Scheer moved to calm the crowd and changed the chant to \u201cVote him out.\u201d\n\nTrudeau embraced immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries are closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide.\n\nHis efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticized by both the right and left. He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta\u2019s oil to international markets.\n\nHis also negotiated a new free trade deal for Canada with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by President Donald Trump to scrap it.\n\nScheer is promising to end the carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25%.\n\n\u201cThat money belongs to you, not to them,\u201d Scheer said.", "description": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canadians are electing a new Parliament on Monday after a tight election campaign that has raised the threat of Prime Minister Justin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/21/f3b32a_canada-election-44891-liberal-leader-justin-trudeau-holds-rally-in-milton-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
