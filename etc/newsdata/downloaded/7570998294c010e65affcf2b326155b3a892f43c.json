Two of her friends told the Beast that they knew about Regalbuto meeting the rapper and eventually spending more time with him before realizing the relationship was inappropriate.\n\nWeeks after they first met, the rapper asked to see Regalbuto again, who told the Beast he knew she was a teenager when he offered to fly her out to Las Vegas. Regalbuto said in her Tik Tok video that she told her parents she was going to the beach for the weekend, turned off her location on her phone, and hopped on a plane.\n\nRegalbuto's story comes just one year after another then-17-year-old Milwaukee native Kelsey Doucette told Jezebel that Riff Raff approached her at a meet-and-greet at the same 2015 tour and a member of his crew invited her into the tour bus, where the rapper took her into a back room and began to kiss her and grope her against her will.\n\nAustralian woman Eliza Stafford previously claimed the rapper had drugged and raped her after a 2013 concert when she was 19. Stafford wrote on Facebook that she was invited backstage during one of Riff Raff's shows, where she says she was offered a shot that caused her to blackout. She claimed that she woke up to the sight of Riff Raff \"pulling out of me and getting into the shower.\"\n\nThe rapper has denied all allegations.", "description": "In a five-part \"storytime\" series of videos, college student Alyssa Regalbuto said she first met the 37-year-old artist at the 2015 Warped Tour.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7d59ec21214c47e82fd638-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
