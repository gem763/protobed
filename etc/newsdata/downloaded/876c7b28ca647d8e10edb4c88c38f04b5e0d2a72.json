Here's how he got his start.", "language": "en", "text": "As anyone actively involved in sports knows, they can carry the risk of injury. And this is just as true for animals like camels and horses that race competitively.\n\nResearch published by the Journal of Camelid Science in 2013, for example, identified that nearly 60% of injuries causing lameness in young racing camels were traumatic. However, our ability to recognize when and how these injuries are occurring, especially in enough time to intervene, is compromised by the fact that animals cannot provide the immediate and comprehensible feedback that humans can. But a company based at Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP) is aiming to change that.\n\nDr. Mohammed Doumir, an Algerian veterinarian, won the fifth season of Qatar Foundation's (QF) edutainment reality TV show \"Stars of Science\" with his Camel Racing Diagnostic Boots, which identify limping in camels and other racing animals. And he says that the competition has changed his life.\n\nReorienting a career\n\nHaving had the chance to participate in the most popular science program in the Arab world, Dr. Doumir was able to leverage his access to the program's technical specialists and experts on the program into redefining and reorienting his whole career.\n\nSince winning \"Stars of Science,\" Dr. Doumir has established his own veterinary diagnostics company, VETOSIS, at QSTP, part of Qatar Foundation Research, Development and Innovation.\n\n\"My experience on 'Stars of Science' has been the most significant experience in my life, challenging both my practical and scientific ambitions, as well as impacting me personally,\" he says.\n\n\"It gave me the courage to resign from my job and start a new journey as an entrepreneur, investing in knowledge and promoting my invention, and establishing VETOSIS to specifically encourage technological innovation and development in veterinary practice.\"\n\nVETOSIS, originally established to develop the device that led to Dr. Doumir triumphing on \"Stars of Science,\" has evolved into a company that develops various animal health equipment, including respiratory trauma diagnosis tools, a cardiovascular health assessment system for animals, and solutions for treating involuntary movements in horses and camels.\n\nIt is the only company in the Arab region that develops and markets new technologies in the field of veterinary diagnosis. VETOSIS owns six patents, three of which have been developed into market-ready products, with three still under development.\n\nAn ecosystem of innovation\n\nThe real impact of QSTP is highlighted by Dr. Doumir when he says, \"After winning 'Stars of Science,' I didn't hesitate to join QSTP so I could complete the development of my project which, at that point, was still only a prototype.\n\n\"I sat down with the experts at QSTP and was given the opportunity to have a laboratory dedicated to developing my products \u2014 alongside the labs of big companies like Cisco, Microsoft and Shell Qatar. It's amazing when you realize how effective this integrated tech space, which was built specifically to facilitate scientific research and the development of modern technologies, has been.\"\n\nQF has prioritized innovation in Qatar, including the development of technologies related to healthcare, clean energy, education, and the economy. Dr. Doumir's experience illustrates how this can lead to challenges being addressed in a way that delivers social and economic impact.\n\n\"Many of the research, development, and innovation projects supported by Qatar Foundation have gone beyond meeting the needs of Qatar's community, and into addressing many regional and global challenges, such as the development of cybersecurity and genomic research projects on incurable diseases,\" says Dr. Doumir.\n\n\"In 2013, I was a veterinarian. Today, I have the technical know-how that millions of Arab youths aspire to have. But I am still learning. And, because of QSTP, I have become more disciplined in my scientific and knowledge-based thinking, more flexible in teamwork and sharing, and more eager to learn from the experiences of others.\"\n\nFind out more about how Qatar Foundation is inspiring developments in science and technology.\n\nThis post was created by Qatar Foundation with Insider Studios.", "description": "Dr. Mohammed Doumir went from being a veterinarian to a tech entrepreneur focused on improving animal healthcare, using Qatar Foundation's resources.", "authors": ["Sponsor Post", "Created Qatar Foundation With Insider Studios"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dadb62ccc4a0a49e061f684?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
