Details of the agreement are still emerging, but will likely include a halt on US tariff increases.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a tweet earlier Friday that \"good things are happening\" at the trade meetings and that \"all would like to see something significant happen.\"\n\nIn response, stocks are sharply higher across the board.\n\nDow INDU S&P 500 SPX Nasdaq Composite COMP Thesoared more than 500 points at its peak, with little time left in the trading day. Thewas up 1.5%, while thetraded 1.7% higher.\n\nAll three indexes are on track for a gain this week, which would be the first in three weeks for the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nBut if anything has been learned throughout the US-China trade negotiations, it's that a tweet or a new headline can change the market's sentiment at the drop of a hat.\n\n\"Everyone is kind of narrowing in on this idea that we will get a smaller, partial deal \u2014 a phase one deal, if you will \u2014 and the worry about the trickier bits later,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n\n\"Investors always overreact and then they adjust relative to the details. That's what we're seeing here,\" Arone added.\n\nSome economic data that could have derailed Friday's rally was University of Michigan consumer sentiment, which over the past months showed growing concerns about trade tensions.\n\nBut the survey-based index beat expectations, with the negative impact of trade policies weighing on consumers' minds a little less.\n\n\"Importantly, the impeachment inquiry has not had a significant negative impact on economic prospect,\" said Richard Curtin, chief economists of the survey of consumers.\n\nElsewhere in commodity markets, oil prices are sharply higher after an Iranian oil tanker was hit by two missiles in the Middle East. The missiles were possible fired from Saudi Arabian soil.\n\nGeopolitical tensions in the oil-rich region pushed prices higher on Friday, but have come off their highs. US oil prices are up 2.4% at $54.81 a barrel, while the international benchmark, Brent crude, is up 2.6% at $60.62 a barrel.", "description": "The Dow and broader stock market were rallying again on Friday as US President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He hold trade talks in Washington.", "authors": ["Anneken Tappe", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191011082413-china-us-talks-liu-he-steven-mnuchin-1010-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
