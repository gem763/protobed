It can be yours \u2014 for a fee.", "language": "en", "text": "The video feels like you\u2019re eavesdropping on a message Scaramucci has left for a close friend. But he doesn\u2019t know Ed or Dan or any of the more than two dozen people he\u2019s made videos for. Instead, he recorded them for strangers, who each paid $100 for a minute-long personalized video.\n\nAll of this is facilitated by Cameo, an app made by a Chicago-based company that lets users buy an exclusive, personally scripted shout-out clip from more than 20,000 celebrities, ranging from NFL athletes like Ray Lewis to actresses like Jennifer Love Hewitt to the guy who used to play the Most Interesting Man in the World for Dos Equis. And now, because it\u2019s 2019 and why not, there\u2019s an entire politics section where people can pay to feel closer to a small selection of political titans. (For our purposes, please count \u201cThe Mooch\u201d among the titans.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCameo launched in April 2018, and recently raised $50 million from investors. Although the company wouldn\u2019t disclose revenue numbers, over a quarter of a million people have paid celebrities from all walks of life to wish them a happy birthday, to make fun of their friend\u2019s fantasy football draft, or even to reveal the sex of their baby. Prices typically range from $15 to $350, and Cameo pockets 25 percent of every transaction.\n\nThe app\u2019s political section accounts for less than 0.15 percent of the 20,000 personalities (or \u201ctalent\u201d) available to record a message. And yet, according to Cameo chief executive and founder Steven Galanis, the politicos fit right in. \u201cFrom the very beginning, we always wanted to have anyone with fans be on the app,\u201d he says. \u201cPoliticians are rock stars. They always have been. I absolutely believe anyone who is big on social media can use this as a way to get back to their fans with one-on-one interaction.\u201d\n\nSo far, Cameo\u2019s political talent, which includes comedians and radio personalities, is overwhelmingly conservative. (This is happenstance, Galanis says, adding that the app\u2019s management team is \u201cas bipartisan as it gets.\u201d) As of October, the most prominent figure associated with liberals, or at least President Trump\u2019s critics, is adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who didn\u2019t even know she appears in the politics category on Cameo until I told her.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d said Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford). \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem accurate. ... But I don\u2019t suppose I mind being in that company. I met the Mooch one time. He seemed like a nice guy.\u201d\n\nDaniels charges $250 for her videos, in which she wishes people happy birthday, shouts out bachelor parties, and often ends with a seductive wink or smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a super fun way to connect with fans, and I especially love seeing reaction videos, the look on someone\u2019s face when they get a surprise birthday or wedding greeting or whatever from me,\u201d she says.\n\nFor Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, who has been on the app for a few months, politics is key to her message. For $60 per video, she wishes people a happy birthday or congratulations for a wedding or anniversary and, almost always, mentions Trump, conservatism or the 2020 election. \u201cOne of the big things people have been asking for is for me to say, \u2018No collusion, no obstruction, Trump 2020,\u2019 \u201d Lahren told me.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe says she gets up to 10 requests a day and plans to use the money she earns to fund her upcoming wedding. She chose her $60 price point because \u201ca lot of people who are requesting me can\u2019t afford something more expensive\u201d and \u201coften just need a few words of encouragement.\u201d\n\nSome users are looking to get more out of the experience than just a smile on their dad\u2019s face. Shane Bouvet, a conservative author, hired Lahren to send himself \u2014 and his upcoming book \u2014 a shout-out. In the video, Lahren congratulates him, thanks him for loving his president, and \u2014 naturally \u2014 mentions she\u2019s excited to read his book. \u201cI use Cameo as a way anyone would use social media,\u201d Bouvet explains. \u201cAnd in this case, I used it as a platform to generate more buzz about my upcoming book.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Galanis whether these videos could be considered commercial endorsements, he said no and pointed to Cameo\u2019s terms of service, which prohibit anyone from sending \u201cadvertising or commercial communications.\u201d In his mind, they\u2019re just shout-outs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, he says, he has gotten interest from political campaigns and sees a not-too-distant future in which candidates join Cameo as a way to both raise money and build relationships with supporters. \u201cYou go to a fundraising dinner with Elizabeth Warren, and you pay upwards of $10,000 for personal time with her,\u201d Galanis notes. \u201cOr you spend four hours to stand in line for a selfie. This is really just helping to democratize that.\u201d\n\nFor Scaramucci, Cameo has not been especially lucrative. He said he donates his earnings to the Brain Tumor Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun, and it\u2019s been entertaining. In some ways it\u2019s the new autograph,\u201d Scaramucci told me. \u201cI don\u2019t take myself that seriously. Some guys ask me for advice, many ask how I got pulled out of the White House, and I\u2019ve only been asked to call myself an a--hole four or five times. Plus, it\u2019s all for charity!\u201d Before ending his conversation with me, he added, \u201cIf your mom has a birthday coming up, tell her she can book me!\u201d\n\nKalina Newman is a writer in Washington.\n\nAD", "description": "Selling online shout-outs for fans is a popular new side gig among politicos.", "authors": ["Kalina Newman"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/W_-IMM1TqUfd0P33O3Yk3eySLmY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2XO5OKHOT4I6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
