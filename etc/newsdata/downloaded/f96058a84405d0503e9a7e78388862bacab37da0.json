Gooding is accused of drunkenly groping the woman\u2019s breasts.\n\nTwo further counts of sexual abuse and forcible touching were added to the case on Tuesday, relating to an incident on October 28, 2018 at Tao nightclub in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. In that incident Gooding is accused of pinching a woman\u2019s bottom.\n\nGooding\u2019s lawyer Mark Heller said the case was \u201cincredulous\u201d and \u201cunbelievable\u201d, arguing that Gooding was being vilified for standard human interaction in the way that Joe Biden was accused of making a woman feel uncomfortable by touching her on the shoulder.", "description": "Prosecutors seeking to convict Cuba Gooding Jr of sexual abuse say they have 14 women willing to testify about the alleged crimes, as additional charges were added to the Oscar-winning actor\u2019s case.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "Philip Johnston", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/14/TELEMMGLPICT000200676009-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
