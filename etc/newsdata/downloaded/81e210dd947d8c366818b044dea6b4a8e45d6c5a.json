Parker Song/Pool via REUTERS\n\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is heading for Tehran, two government officials said on Friday, weeks after the United States asked him to help mediate between long-time regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nA top official at Khan\u2019s office and another at the foreign office confirmed that Khan was scheduled to fly to neighbouring Iran at the weekend. It was not immediately clear if Khan had agreed to act as mediator.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister is leaving for Iran most probably tomorrow, or Sunday,\u201d the official at the PM office said.\n\nThey both talked to Reuters on condition of anonymity because the foreign office has yet to make a formal announcement.\n\nPakistan\u2019s foreign office spokesman, Mohammad Faisal, said on Thursday that Khan might visit Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Tehran visit comes after Khan last month said U.S. President Donald Trump had asked him to help defuse tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Washington blamed Tehran for a Sept. 14 attack on the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. Iran denies involvement.\n\nAn Iranian-owned oil tanker was struck, probably by missiles, in the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia\u2019s coast on Friday, Iranian media said.\n\nThe attack, which has yet to be independently confirmed, is the latest involving oil tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf area, and is likely to ratchet up tensions between Tehran and Riyadh, which have been fighting a proxy war in Yemen, at the southern end of the Red Sea.", "description": "Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is heading for Tehran, two government officials said on Friday, weeks after the United States asked him to help mediate between long-time regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439722659&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1FS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
