Her name is Holly, and she lives in Alaska", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\n\u201cRiver, river in the fall, who\u2019s the fattest bear of all?\u201d\n\nAfter a week of fierce competition, southwest Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park and Preserve named \u201cHolly\u201d as the fifth annual Fat Bear Week champion.\n\nFrom Oct. 2 to 8, the park asked social media followers to vote on which husky hibernator is the fattest bear of the Brooks River.\n\nThe public voted via Katmai\u2019s Facebook page and 435, also known as \u201cHolly,\u201d emerged as this year\u2019s winner.\n\n\u201cShe is fat. She is fabulous,\u201d the park said in its Facebook post. \u201cAll hail Holly whose healthy heft will help her hibernate until the spring. Long live the Queen of Corpulence!\u201d\n\nKatmai National Park hosts one of the largest concentrations of brown bears in the world, according to the park\u2019s website.\n\nBulking up is a necessity for bears to prepare themselves for hibernation, so the fattest bear is actually considered the healthiest as it means a stronger chance of survival during the winter.\n\nHibernation can last half a year, and a bear can lose up to one-third of its body mass, the park\u2019s website says. Before their winter slumber, bears enter a state where they eat nearly nonstop, an event called hyperphagia.\n\nA bear stocks up on sockeye salmon, which contains about 4,500 calories per fish, to make weight before hibernating. They can eat upward of two dozen fish per day during peak season.\n\nContributing: Sara M.
