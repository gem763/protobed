The MeToo company, a start-up based in Brooklyn and created by Madison Campbell, has created \u2014 in theory \u2014 the first at-home, self-managed forensic exam, intended to be used by survivors of sexual assault. Campbell calls her product the \u201cMeToo kit,\u201d and its slogan adopts the ethos and language of its namesake movement: \u201cYour experience. Your kit. Your story. Your life. Your choice.\u201d\n\nBut many in the sexual-assault advocacy and legal professional communities have voiced concerns about the MeToo kit\u2019s viability in the criminal justice system. At the end of August, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel sent the company a cease-and-desist letter, accusing it of violating several sections of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Protection Act. Nessel stated, \u201cThis company is shamelessly trying to take financial advantage of the \u2018Me Too\u2019 movement by luring victims into thinking that an at-home-do-it-yourself sexual assault kit will stand up in court \u2026 Career prosecutors know that evidence collected in this way would not provide the necessary chain of custody.\u201d This week, New York attorney general Letitia James joined Nessel\u2019s call for Campbell to cease and desist, stating her concern that the MeToo kits would \u201cdeter individuals from seeking professional care.\u201d\n\nEbony Tucker, advocacy director of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, echoes the attorney generals\u2019 concerns. \u201cWhen evidence is taken as part of a forensic exam in a rape case, there has to be a very clear order of who came into contact with the evidence: who had access to touch it, see it, know where it was,\u201d she says. These measures are taken in order to ensure evidence isn\u2019t tampered with, and to prevent that claim from being made in court. Done at home, by oneself, there would be countless opportunities to contaminate evidence \u2014 and any defense attorney would know that.\n\nCampbell has thus far rejected these concerns, calling Nessel\u2019s original remarks \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d and \u201cdownright shameful.\u201d In response to James\u2019s cease-and-desist, Campbell also told BuzzFeed News that she would \u201cnever stop fighting.\u201d\n\nWhile the MeToo kit\u2019s FAQ states that they have \u201ca multi-step plan so that the kit retains chain of custody,\u201d no such plan is provided. (Campbell didn\u2019t respond to my request for more detail.) The page also states that \u201cthere is no guarantee that any of the evidence collected as a result of the use of this product will be admissible in court.\u201d This, too, is something they claim to be working on. As it stands, though, what the MeToo kit offers is a couple swabs, a spit receptacle, and a box in which to place one\u2019s clothing \u2014 all in Glossier-ish packaging. \u201cThis is little more than an ancestry DNA kit,\u201d says Tucker.\n\nThe kit\u2019s focus on DNA collection also displays an ignorance of the typical trajectory of most sexual assault cases. \u201cIn a lot of sexual assault cases, the defendant isn\u2019t saying they didn\u2019t have sex with the victim \u2014 they\u2019re saying the sex they had was consensual,\u201d says Tucker. \u201c[The kit] gives the impression that if you can analyze forensic evidence, all rape cases will be solved.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the MeToo kit\u2019s FAQ page that the company lacks in basic sexual-assault awareness. Suggesting that customers buy the kit prior to being assaulted, the company confusingly draws a comparison between rape kits and fire alarms, explaining that you buy a fire alarm not for the 364 days you \u201cdon\u2019t have a fire,\u201d but the one day you do. \u201cWe trust this to be a deterrent for sexual assault,\u201d it continues.\n\nIt should go without saying that keeping a Q-tip and a plastic tube in a box in one\u2019s home does not ensure that one won\u2019t be sexually assaulted, just as keeping an earthquake kit does not prevent earthquakes. Saying it does might, however, be a good way to get more people to buy your product.\n\nThough they claim their kit empowers victims of sexual violence, the \u201cMeToo\u201d company also discourages them from receiving the care they need and deserve, says Ilse Knecht, director of policy and advocacy at the Joyful Heart Foundation. \u201cWhen we think about what the forensic medical examination is, the forensic piece is one part of it,\u201d says Knecht. \u201cThe other big issue is the medical piece, and survivors often need medical treatment for potential serious health concerns, such as HIV, STIs, and internal injuries. Some sexual assaults also include strangulation. Those signs can only really be determined in a medical facility.\u201d If survivors were to elect to perform an at-home kit themselves, thinking it equivalent to a hospital forensic exam, they might unwittingly deny themselves other needed medical treatment.\n\nAccording to the advocates I spoke to, the ideal for survivors of sexual assault is to receive a timely, trauma-informed forensic medical exam by a trained forensic examiner, called SANEs (sexual assault nurse examiner) or SAFEs (sexual assault forensic examiner). Those in the advocacy community recognize that access to SANEs/SAFEs isn\u2019t always what it should be. \u201cThere are trauma hospitals in this country that do not have trained sexual assault examiners,\u201d says Knecht. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d In some parts of the country, getting access to a trained examiner might mean traveling dozens or hundreds of miles \u2014 a journey many can\u2019t afford to make. But the \u201csolution\u201d supposedly offered by the MeToo kit is woefully incomplete, and quite possibly dangerous.\n\n\u201cDoing this would let the system off the hook,\u201d says Knecht. \u201cWe owe it to survivors to make sure we\u2019re building a framework, or safety net, to ensure that their medical care and evidence collection is going to be done in an appropriate setting, and in a way that makes them feel empowered, at no cost to the survivor, by the way.\u201d\n\nThe price of the MeToo kit has yet to be revealed, though, per the site, it will be \u201cpocket-friendly.\u201d The preorder page is \u201ccoming soon\u201d \u2014 clicking \u201cGet the kit\u201d will prompt the site\u2019s visitors to join the wait list. The site\u2019s FAQ page states the company\u2019s \u201ccurrent strategy is B2B sales\u201d but that they anticipate a future \u201cconsumer campaign on a crowdfunding platform, in conjunction with sales in pharmacies.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated.", "description": "The \u201cMeToo\u201d kit is a start-up, at-home rape kit created by Madison Campbell.
