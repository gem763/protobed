The reason is, in part, as a result of Amazon which helped segue the sale\u2019s popularity across the Atlantic in 2010, offering deals on its UK site with the high street soon following suit.\n\nOur IndyBest team has hand-picked every deal featured here. We may earn some commission from the links in this article, but our selections have been made independently and without bias. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nWhen is Black Friday?\n\nThe sale's date always falls on the first Friday after Thanksgiving. This year, it will take place on Friday 29 November and will last the entire weekend, culminating with Cyber Monday, which is the online-only day of the sale.\n\nHowever, unlike other years, this year's sale falls relatively late in November meaning there's less than a month for shoppers to find a deal before Christmas.\n\nBut Black Friday deals \u2013 on the high street and online \u2013 begin long before the actual day, from anywhere between the week before to as early as mid October.\n\nWhich brands take part in the sale?\n\nThe biggest retailers on the high street and online \u2013 from Argos to Currys, John Lewis & Partners and Amazon \u2013 are some of the most reliable for bagging Black Friday deals, while high street fashion brands such as Topshop, Mango and New Look have all previously offered deals, too.\n\nHomeware and furniture stores such as Anthropologie, Habitat, Made, Swoon Editions and Soak & Sleep are also expected to reduce prices, as well as many airlines such as EasyJet and British Airways.\n\nWhat's the best way to get a Black Friday deal?\n\nAlthough there will be thousands of good deals available, the key to getting the best value for your money is to be prepared well in advance of the sales.\n\nOur IndyBest team will be doing most of the hard work for you, finding the best offers on everything from TVs and fashion to furniture and flights, as well as providing extensive guides on how to bag the best bargain. As a result, it's worth checking The Independent closer to the time for our top tips and deals.\n\nWhen it comes to preparing for the big day, first of all, think about what you actually want. Is it a new winter coat from The North Face, a pair of wireless Beats headphones, an iPad or a Foreo Luna beauty gadget?\n\nThe key is not getting drawn into seemingly \"good looking\" deals that you don\u2019t actually want or need.\n\nOnce you know what you want, make sure that you shop around to find the best price for it before the Black Friday sale begins. That way, you\u2019ll know if a sale deal really is a bargain or not.\n\nDeals will be available both on the high street and online, so whether you can face shopping centres and the likes of London\u2019s Oxford Street, or prefer to search from the comfort of your own home, everyone can benefit from the offers.\n\nTips for Black Friday shopping online\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve already got an account with big e-commerce websites like Amazon to make shopping easier and quicker (no time wasted entering all your details), and if you want next day delivery, register for Amazon Prime.\n\nSign up to newsletters of brands that you like and might want to shop from so that you\u2019re first to know when their sales start and any discount codes you might need.\n\nDownload the apps of retailers you use and follow them on Instagram and Twitter for deals, too.\n\nTo find the original price of a product, use PriceSpy or CamelCamelCamel \u2013 the latter is especially useful for Amazon.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to check retailer\u2019s returns policies before buying and to check the terms and conditions for sites you\u2019ve not used before.\n\nTo make sure you are shopping safely online, check any emails you receive properly before clicking links to make sure they\u2019re legitimate.\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping from a computer, it\u2019s also a good idea to ensure your anti-malware software is up to date.\n\nCan I get cashback on Black Friday deals?\n\nThis all depends on your debit or credit card provider.\n\nDuring the Black Friday period, a number of retailers offer cashback on purchases, while websites such as Quidco also offer cashback for new customers of big brands. So, make sure you look into these policies before November.\n\nWhat were the best deals last year?\n\nSome of the best deals are often on Amazon\u2019s own products, including the Echo devices, Fire tablets and Kindles which are expected to see the same slashed prices again this year.\n\nApple\u2019s iPads also had good price drops last year, making them a great buy as Apple traditionally only offers small discounts on a limited range of products.\n\nBundles on the Nintendo Switch were also popular in 2018, as well as new phone contracts, meaning Black Friday is an ideal time to pick up a new smartphone along with a great contract offer.\n\nHeadphones were also a big deal in 2018\u2019s sale thanks to Apple\u2019s AirPods, but other impressive offers included Bose\u2019s QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones which were popular.\n\nWhat are the best deals this year?\n\nAlthough deals are yet to be released, we\u2019re expecting to see great price drops on high value items such as the Apple\u2019s AirPods as wireless earbuds which continue to rule the headphone market.\n\nOther deals we predict will be featured are consoles, smartphones and TVs including PS4, iPhone XR and Samsung Galaxy S9, while LG\u2019s OLED range of 4K TVs are hopefully going to be offering good deals.\n\nMany of the new smartphones debut in the upcoming months, including the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro this month, so we expect to see some offers across the big brand phones and accessories.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
