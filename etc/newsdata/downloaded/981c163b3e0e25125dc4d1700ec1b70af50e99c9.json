I'm not the sort of person to make a big fuss, I just got something else. I wasn't there to inspect the hotel.\"\n\nBA lawyers were \"adamant that food standards were high\" throughout the 11 restaurants at the hotel, the court heard, and claimed no other guests complained of belly trouble.\n\nBut after a short court hearing, Judge Hill-Smith ruled in favour of Miss Librati, holding BA liable for her illness.\n\nHe found Miss Librati a \"credible witness\" and accepted expert evidence about food from the Occidental being the likely source of her sickness.\n\n\"She had diarrhoea and vomiting and her illness continued for the remainder of the holiday,\" he said.\n\n\"The holiday was provided by [British Airways] and there's no dispute that it was a term of the contract that the food had to be of satisfactory quality.\n\n\"I find on the balance of probabilities that it was infected food which caused the illness, and therefore find for Miss Librati,\" the judge ruled, although adding that nobody would ever know for sure the precise cause of her sickness.\n\nHaving been found liable, BA agreed to pay \u00a34,250 in damages to Ms Librati and were ordered to pay \u00a311,000 legal costs.\n\n", "description": "British Airways, which was taken to court after the couple's five-star Carribean package break was ruined, paid \u00a34,000 compo plus \u00a311,000 legal costs", "authors": ["Nev Ayling", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Champion News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755892.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-JessicaLibrati1jpgw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
