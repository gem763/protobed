(AP)\n\nTrue to form, he responded with a dig of his own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s whatever... In the wise words of [Browns head coach] Freddie Kitchens, if you don\u2019t wear orange and brown, you don\u2019t matter, and Rex Ryan doesn\u2019t have any colors right now for a reason.\u201d\n\n#Browns Baker Mayfield on Rex Ryan saying he\u2019s \u2018overrated as hell\u2019 pic.twitter.com/zESXi89cOk \u2014 Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) September 25, 2019\n\nRyan hasn\u2019t coached since the Buffalo Bills fired him toward the end of the 2016 season.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s asinine to even say\u2019\n\nWhen he was asked to elaborate on Mayfield\u2019s deficiencies, Ryan said the 2018 No. 1 pick is a one-read guy who improvises when his first look isn\u2019t available; is too slow to outrun defenders when he takes off; is staring down receivers; and isn\u2019t accurate down the field.\n\nHe may have been exaggerating - Ryan certainly is known to do that - but it\u2019s not debatable that Mayfield hasn\u2019t come out of the gate strong thus far this season. He\u2019s completing 56.9 percent of his passes, down from 63.8 percent in his 14 games as a rookie, and has three passing touchdowns against five interceptions. He\u2019s had at least one pick in each of the Browns\u2019 three games.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot that we\u2019d expect much else, but Kitchens was quick to come to Mayfield\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cI appreciate his opinion and all that, but he is not in our building,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cHe has no idea what we are doing. I would answer that with that.\u201d\n\nAs to Ryan\u2019s charge that Mayfield is a \u201cone-read quarterback,\u201d Kitchens said, \u201cNo he is not. That is asinine to even say.\u201d\n\nWith the Browns 1-2 as they head to Baltimore this Sunday after an offseason of hype, the only way to stop the comments, from Ryan or anyone, will be to start stringing together wins.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Take that, Rex.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bFqo9RKaQhUe2VY.36lVag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MzcuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OIdXD8w8w3leVT1BgZ3izA--~B/aD0yMjE2O3c9MzM4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/fe224f40-dfca-11e9-994f-c2e6ae0cdb21", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
