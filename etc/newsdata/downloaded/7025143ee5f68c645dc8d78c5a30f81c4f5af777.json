There\u2019s no reliable way to anticipate the success of a given costume being introduced. You can guess based on previous experience with similar concepts and its place in pop culture, but unfortunately, costume sales outcomes are incongruous to traditional sales projection markers.\u201d Aidan Griffin, Director of Digital Marketing at Ketner Group Communications said about the unpredicatable nature of KFC's costume.\n\nAdult- and kid-sized versions of KFC founder Colonel Sanders costumes are available at Spirit Halloween.

However, he noted that adults are the reason for the fluctuation.\n\n\u201cThursday is a pretty good day.
