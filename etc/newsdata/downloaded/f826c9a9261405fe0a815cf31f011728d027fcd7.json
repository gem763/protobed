It has been hit by efforts to rein in risky debt and the trade war with the US, which led the IMF to shave almost a percentage point off global growth.\n\nThus far, the IMF said central banks have managed to blunt the impact of the slowdown with tools such as low interest rates. Without those stimulus policies, it estimates that the growth rate would have been 0.5 percentage points lower this year.\n\n\"With central banks having to spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes, they may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot,\" the fund said.\n\nDownside risks\n\nThe World Trade Organization also recently downgraded its economic outlook, citing trade wars, Brexit and other factors.\n\nThe IMF said the global economy could grow faster in 2020, at 3.4%. However, it warned that risks are \"skewed to the downside\", noting that the pickup depends on improvements in India, as well as several economies currently under severe strain, such as Argentina, Turkey and Iran.\n\n\"Policy missteps at this juncture, such as a no-deal Brexit or a further deepening of trade disputes, could severely undermine sentiment, growth, and job creation,\" it said. \"The foremost priority, in many cases, is to remove policy-induced uncertainty or threats to growth.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\nBy Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent\n\nWhat can policymakers do to tackle the global economic slowdown? The commentary from the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, has something to say about three major policy tools.\n\nTrade policy is the obvious one. The IMF blames much of the weakening outlook on trade tensions so you would expect a call to reverse the tariff increases imposed by several countries, notably the US.\n\nThat does indeed top Ms Gopinath's list. Central banks have already taken steps - interest rate cuts and other measures. She describes these moves as spending limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes.\n\nShe warns that central banks may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot. It's a worry that has been bubbling for several years before the recent escalation of trade tensions as central banks reached for new ideas in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\nMs Gopinath argues this cannot be the \"only game in town\". Governments that can afford it - she mentions Germany, in particular - should cut taxes or increase spending. And she says if things get worse, an internationally co-ordinated response along these lines might be required.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund warns against \"policy mistakes\" such as tariffs and a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/587F/production/_109155622_gettyimages-1174493488.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
