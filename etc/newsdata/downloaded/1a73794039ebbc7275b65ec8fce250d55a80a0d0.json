The United States has that commitment,\u201d Ortagus added.\n\nKim, the North Korean negotiator, offered a less optimistic summary of the talks thus far, telling reporters: \u201cThe U.S. raised expectations by offering suggestions like a flexible approach, new method and creative solutions, but they have disappointed us greatly and dampened our enthusiasm for negotiation by bringing nothing to the negotiation table,\u201d according to the news service.\n\nKim added that the total denuclearization sought by the U.S. is still possible, but only \u201cwhen all the obstacles that threaten our safety and check our development are removed completely without a shadow of doubt.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean officials have repeatedly sought relief from U.S. sanctions as part of ongoing talks.\n\nThe negotiations, held on the outskirts of Stockholm, were the first between the two nations since a June meeting between President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump criticizes supposed second whistleblower North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Window narrows for Trump trade deals MORE and North Korea's Kim Jong Un Kim Jong UnNorth Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities U.S., North Korea break off nuclear talks: report Pompeo says 'a lot of work' ahead for North Korea, US nuke talks MORE.", "description": "North Korea\u2019s top negotiator reportedly said Saturday that nuclear talks between\u00a0Pyongyang and the U.S. have broken down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/northkorea_kimjongun_trumpdonald_062918getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
