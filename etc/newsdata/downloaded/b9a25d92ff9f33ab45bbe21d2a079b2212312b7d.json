Picture taken on September 5, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nCuba, which in many ways remains stuck in the analogue past, may seem an unlikely hotbed for cryptocurrencies - digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions.\n\nYet the roll-out of mobile internet nearly a year ago has opened the way for cryptocurrency transactions, and enthusiasts have multiplied as the currency helps overcome obstacles created by U.S. sanctions on Cuba.\n\nThe decades-old U.S. trade embargo cuts Cubans off from conventional international payment systems and financial markets. Cubans cannot obtain credit or debit cards for international use on the island and struggle to do so abroad.\n\nSo Cubans like Sanchez are buying digital currencies, which are mostly unregulated, decentralized and anonymous, to make purchases online as well as to invest and trade.\n\n\u201cThis is really opening new doors for us,\u201d said Sanchez, who uses Bitcoin, the most well known cryptocurrency, to purchase parts not available new in Cuba from an online Chinese store.\n\nAlex Sobrino, founder of the Telegram channel CubaCripto where Cubans debate and trade digital currencies, said he estimated some 10,000 Cubans were using them.\n\n\u201cWe are using cryptocurrencies to top up our cellphones, to make purchases online, and there are even people reserving hotel rooms with (it),\u201d said the 33-year-old, who trades crypto as a side gig to his family\u2019s baking business.\n\nTo be sure, it is unlikely the digital coins will become a primary payment method for the Caribbean island\u2019s 11.2 million inhabitants any time soon.\n\nCryptocurrency trading still falls in gray legal territory in Cuba.\n\nAnd since Cubans mostly do not have credit cards, many have to ask relatives abroad to purchase them their first installment of cryptocurrency or buy within the community on social media channels like CubaCripto, which has more than 400 members.\n\nOften the two sides of the deal meet face to face for the buyer to hand over cash and the seller to carry out the transaction on a laptop or phone.\n\nSanchez bought fractions of Bitcoin - which are worth around $10,000 each - through a startup founded a year ago by Cubans in Brazil that aims to make crypto purchases more businesslike.\n\nCUBA\u2019S FIRST CRYPTO EXCHANGE\n\nFusyona, which bills itself Cuba\u2019s first crypto exchange, uses the hard currency of people abroad who want to send remittances to Cuba to invest in any of nine major cryptocurrencies via a larger exchange.\n\nIt then uses the pesos of Cubans who want to invest at least the equivalent of $150 in crypto to pay the remittances. The website, which charges a fee of up to 10 percent, has some 1,300 users to date.\n\n\u201cFor foreigners, cryptocurrencies is just another option,\u201d said founder Adrian C. Leon, a 31-year-old Cuban computer scientist based in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\u201cBut for Cubans it is a necessity and can be a solution to their exclusion from the global financial community.\u201d\n\nSeveral crowdfunding platforms shut down accounts for victims of the tornado in Havana earlier this year, for example, despite donations being legal, simply due to the mention of Cuba.\n\nForeign platforms are nervous about carrying out even legal transactions regarding Cuba due to past multimillion-dollar U.S. fines on institutions for violating sanctions.\n\nFusyona however set up its own donations account in Bitcoin that faced no such problems.\n\nCUBAN GOVERNMENT CRYPTO?\n\nThe Cuban government said in July it was itself exploring the potential of cryptocurrency, following in the footsteps of other countries under U.S. sanctions like Venezuela and Iran.\n\nDuring a brief stay on the island, U.S. fugitive, crypto evangelist and founder of McAfee antivirus software John McAfee made headlines saying he would be willing to help Cuba in the endeavor.\n\nHowever Cuba could, like Iran, choose to develop an experimental national cryptocurrency even while banning trading in existing digital currencies due to concerns about money laundering or a clash with its Communist principles.\n\n\u201cWe worry the government will restrict us, prohibit things, start to say this is illicit enrichment,\u201d said Sobrino.\n\nHe added that he would welcome government support of the fledgling crypto community and was aware of the need to protect would-be investors from scammers taking advantage of the lack of regulation, as elsewhere in the world.\n\nLeon said he was nervous his agents on the island who receive and transfer cash might be suspected of dodgy financial dealings and has started talks with Central Bank officials about the possibility of getting an official stamp of approval for Fusyona. The business is registered in Brazil.\n\nThe Central Bank is exploring the benefits and risks of the digital currency, state-run website Cubadebate said on Tuesday.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nProfessor Alexi Masso Muoz of Havana University\u2019s cryptography institute was cited as saying there are no laws on the topic currently, \u201calthough it is possible it will shortly have some.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the craze is reaching even Cuba\u2019s eastern regions, far from the cosmopolitan capital.\n\n\u201cI hope in the future cryptocurrency will be par for the course for all Cubans,\u201d said Ruslan Concepcion, 27, who lives in the quiet eastern city of Las Tunas and invests in crypto to earn extra income.", "description": "Jason Sanchez, 35, was able to start buying spare parts online last year for his cellphone repair shop in Havana thanks to the advent of cryptocurrency trading in Communist-run Cuba.", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429210209&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B21M", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
