He went on to suggest that the current set-up will 'cost him his career'.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Strength wise I was perfectly happy with it.\n\n\u201cJohn is Tyson's dad so of course you have to respect him but Tyson was fully prepared and you can't do anything about sustaining a bad cut.\n\n\u201cJust because he's gone 12 rounds it doesn't mean he's weak. If he was weak he wouldn't have been able to do 12 rounds there.\u201d\n\nWallin was a 12/1 underdog with most bookmakers along the Strip here in Vegas as Fury was expected to make reasonably lightwork of the little-known Swede.\n\nIt is only 13 weeks since Fury despatched Tom Schwarz inside two rounds and many expected a similarly one-sided affair.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

That's why he made it a dog fight. Close the gap so he didnt have to be able to see the shots coming.\n\n\u201cHe was listening to my instructions and doing what I was telling him to do. I thought Otto would crack but he showed a lot of heart and didn't crack.\u201d\n\nVictory means Fury is still on course to face Deontay Wilder in their long-awaited rematch, scheduled for February 22, provided his cut heals in time. But after back-to-back camps, Davison is wary of burnout.\n\n\u201cPotentially he may need a rest we will have to wait and see but he's training 24/7,\u201d he added. \u201cMaybe he does need a rest now.\u201d", "description": "Tyson Fury\u2019s trainer Ben Davison\u00a0has hit back at suggestions from the heavyweight's own father that the former world champion's whole career will be at threat until he changes his coaching team.
