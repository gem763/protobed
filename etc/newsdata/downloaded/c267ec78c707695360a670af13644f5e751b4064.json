And: Polly Toynbee on the Queen\u2019s speech\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by four months of violent protests against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the city. The unrest has plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997. The protests were prompted by a now-abandoned bill that would have allowed extradition of suspects from Hong Kong to China and Communist party-controlled courts. But they have widened into a pro-democracy movement.\n\nAnushka Asthana talks to one protester about why he has been returning to the streets, week after week. He discusses his fears over the escalating violence and why people are willing to die for this cause.\n\nAnd: Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee on the Queen\u2019s speech", "description": "A Hong Kong protester describes why he has returned to the streets, week in week out, in the face of an increasingly brutal crackdown by the authorities.
