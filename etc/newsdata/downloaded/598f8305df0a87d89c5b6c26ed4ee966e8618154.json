He views the Kurdish forces as a threat to his country. Republicans and Democrats have warned that allowing the Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds and send a troubling message to American allies across the globe.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

As he faces an impeachment inquiry at home, Mr Trump has appeared more focused on making good on his political pledges, even at the risk of sending a troubling signal to American allies abroad.\n\nKey Republican leaders in Congress appeared taken aback by the move.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, also said in an appearance on Fox News that he had not spoken with Mr Trump about the decision and had concerns.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure we keep our word for those who fight with us and help us,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cIf you make a commitment and somebody is fighting with you. America should keep their word.\u201d\n\nOne of the show\u2019s hosts, Brian Kilmeade, asked Mr McCarthy to try to intervene and \u201ccall the president before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has closely aligned himself with Donald Trump on foreign policy issues, blasted the president on Twitter over his decision pull the US military out of Syria.\u00a0 The senator slammed Mr Trump over the move, saying it would lead to the revival of the Islamic State, hamper US-Turkish relations and serve as \u201ca stain\u201d on", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/09/gettyimages-1085006712.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
