He hadn\u2019t been affected by the issue in Japan, Kolisi said.\n\n\u201cNot from what I\u2019m seeing. We\u2019ve been just preparing for the game,\u201d Kolisi said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s a very important game for us this week. Every game for us from now on is a playoff game. If we slip up, we\u2019re out of the competition so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focusing on.\u201d\n\nThe allegations against Etzebeth first surfaced in late August. Etzebeth was accused of assaulting and racially abusing a person at a bar while on a night out with friends and family in a coastal town near Cape Town.\n\nThe 27-year-old lock, who is 2.03 meters (6-foot-8) tall, denied the allegations and SA Rugby backed him and said they believed him when he said he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus also said he believed Etzebeth\u2019s side of the story after meeting with him.\n\nThe story re-emerged as an unwelcome distraction for the Springboks in Japan on Wednesday when the South African Human Rights Commission announced it would start legal proceedings against Etzebeth at an equality court on Friday, the same day Etzebeth and South Africa face Italy in the possibly decisive Pool B game.\n\nFor now, Etzebeth won\u2019t leave the Rugby World Cup.\n\n\u201cEben \u2026 is part of our squad for the World Cup. He\u2019s going to be playing tomorrow and he\u2019s going to be focusing on the game,\u201d Springboks assistant coach Mzwandile Stick said.\n\nStick said Etzebeth remained a good team player and was \u201cin a good space.\u201d\n\nAn equality court in South Africa generally operates like a civil court. No criminal charges have been filed against Etzebeth.\n\nThe internal SA Rugby investigation, which was announced by the organization earlier Thursday and in the hours after the human rights commission\u2019s move, will be carried out in South Africa and shouldn\u2019t affect the squad in Japan. While publicly backing Etzebeth and accepting his explanation, SA Rugby also wants to be sure of exactly what happened.\n\n\u201cFollowing our discussions with the South African Human Rights Commission we have instituted an internal process to address the matter, the details of which remain an employment matter between SA Rugby and the player,\u201d SA Rugby said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Springboks have maintained their focus on a crucial Rugby World Cup game against Italy, captain Siya Kolisi said Thursday, amid an internal investigation into allegations that teammate Eben Etzebeth physically and racially abused someone in a late-night incident in South Africa before the tournament.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": ""}
