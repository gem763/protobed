Understanding your familial and inherited health risks can help you take action with your doctor to improve your chances of better health outcomes,\u201d Ancestry CEO Margo Georgiadis said Tuesday.\n\nUnlike 23andMe, Ancestry does not allow consumers to order health tests directly. They can access health tests ordered from physicians at PWNHealth, an independent network of physicians and genetic counselors, in addition to genetic counseling resources.\n\nThe company is offering two new products \u2014 AncestryHealth Core and AncestryHealth Plus.\n\nAncestryHealth Core covers common health conditions and includes family health history and lab reports. The physician-ordered lab test uses genotyping array technology to detect genetic differences and offers personalized reports for certain conditions.\n\nAncestryHealth Plus uses next-generation sequencing technology to deliver comprehensive screening data of DNA differences for health conditions.\n\nRival company 23andMe offers more than 90 reports on genetic health risks, carrier status and other wellness-related traits. The company also gives consumers the option to explore results with varying confidence levels, ranging from 50% to more than 90%.\n\n23andMe offers reports on health conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, celiac disease, late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
