His father Pierre was also a Canadian head of government, while his mother Margaret was once a jetsetting pal of the Rolling Stones and other cultural luminaries.\n\nIn the election, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s principal opponent is Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, 40, who has led the opposition in Ottawa since 2017.\n\nAs often happens in parliamentary systems, Canadian voters could create a fractured Parliament in which no party has a majority and party leaders would jockey to cobble together a coalition government.\n\nThe race is considered an extremely close one, with Mr. Trudeau\u2019s narrow polling lead in September all but gone in most recent accounts.\n\nLast week, the National Post published an online poll showing Canadians ranked Mr. Trudeau as by far the most elitist and fake candidate in the bunch, but neither he nor Mr. Scheer scored particularly well on who they considered most honest, with Mr. Scheer edging Mr. Trudeau by 17% to 14%.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
