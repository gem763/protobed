Caramelizing onions can be a time-consuming affair, but here, the process is sped up by using high heat and and a little water to prevent scorching.

Instead of topping the dish with a dusting of diminutive bread crumbs, it\u2019s dotted with Gruy\u00e8re toasts that become melty and crisp after a few minutes under the broiler. (You\u2019ll want to slide a sheet pan underneath before baking, in case some of the sauce bubbles over.)
