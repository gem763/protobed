It\u2019s sturdy, stylish, and comfortable. It launches with a library that\u2019s already over 2,500 games strong. If all you\u2019re looking for from the Nintendo Switch is personal, portable play, it\u2019s perfect. But is that all you\u2019re looking for?\n\nFrom its first trailer, with its rooftop parties, car trips, and esports tournaments, the $329.95 Nintendo Switch has been a device that\u2019s not just about which games to play but how to play them. Basic portable play is part of it, but so is connecting to a high-definition television in the living room, or slipping off a Joy-Con and passing it to a friend as easy as sharing a piece of candy.\n\nThose amazing little removable controllers, paired with hardware features like HD rumble and infrared cameras, allow Nintendo to explore new ways to combine real-world activity and gaming with products like Labo and the upcoming Ring-Con. Versatility defines the Switch.\n\nThe $329.95 Switch Lite is not a versatile gaming device. It plays Switch games in handheld mode. It does not support television mode. While Joy-Cons, purchased separately, can be connected to the Lite, the Lite\u2019s smaller screen (6.2 inches to the Switch\u2019s 5.5) and lack of an integrated kickstand make tabletop play inconvenient. There is no rumble. There is no infrared camera. It still supports near-field communication for Amiibo support, and has a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope for motion control, so not all of the Switch\u2019s extra features have been stripped away.\n\nBut most of them have. As has been pointed out time and time again since the hardware was announced in July, there\u2019s not much \u201cSwitch\u201d in the Switch Lite. \u201cSwitch Lacking\u201d would be more accurate, if far less marketable.\n\nThough I don\u2019t see it as such, many consider the Switch Lite to be Nintendo\u2019s successor to the 3DS, the dual-screened portable gaming system that\u2019s been desperately clinging to life since the Switch launched in early 2017 and is now all but dead. I understand the comparison. Both the 3DS and the Switch Lite are devices exclusively made for portable gaming. But where the 3DS and its kin had their own ecosystem of unique games, most of which can\u2019t be played anywhere else, the Switch Lite plays Switch games. To me the Switch Lite is to the Switch as the 2DS is to the 3DS. Both play the same games, but one is cheaper and stripped of features that some players never bothered with anyway. I would not trade my 2DS XL in for a Switch Lite.\n\nNintendo portable meet-up.\n\nJudged strictly as a portable personal gaming system, the Switch Lite is better than the original Switch. It\u2019s more compact, which makes it more portable. Since it has no removable parts, the Switch Lite feels much more solid and sturdy than the regular Switch in handheld mode, even though it weighs slightly less.\n\nThe plastic that makes up the Switch Lite\u2019s casing has a soft and slightly rough texture to it that\u2019s a joy on the fingertips. The three colours Nintendo chose for for the initial batch of Switch Lites, yellow, grey, and turquoise, give the device a hip, retro look.\n\nThe battery life is slightly longer than my launch Switch, though not as long as the newer models. And then there\u2019s the D-pad, that lovely little white cross in place of the regular Switch\u2019s dinky buttons. I\u2019ve been playing with the Switch Lite for several days now, and every time my thumb brushes that D-pad there\u2019s still a tiny burst of joy.\n\nIt\u2019s only slightly bigger than the D-pad on my 2DS XL and just as shallow, but it\u2019s responsive enough, and most importantly it\u2019s not four disconnected pieces of round plastic.\n\nAs a portable system, the only real downside to the Switch Lite is the screen size. Most of the time, the .7 inch difference between the regular Switch and the smaller Switch Lite isn\u2019t a problem.. But when I play games like Fire Emblem: Three Houses, recently categorised by Kotaku\u2019s Heather Alexandra as one of the Switch\u2019s \u201cextremely good games with tiny text,\u201d my poor, ageing eyes struggle even harder on the Lite. Maybe the launch of a portable-only Switch with a smaller screen will make developers more conscientious of tiny text. Or maybe we\u2019ll just have to squint more.\n\nIf my only desire was to play Switch games in handheld mode, I would choose the Switch Lite over the regular Switch, hands down. It\u2019s cheaper. It plays all the games I want to play. It looks and feels better in my hands, and it\u2019s impossible for my chonky fingers to accidentally disconnect a Joy-Con during heated play. Yes, I have done this.\n\nBut the original does a whole lot of cool stuff the Switch Lite does not do\u2014 \u2014 stuff I\u2019ve grown used to, and now feel awkward going without. Removing Joy-Cons to play multiplayer games is a Switch feature I hardly ever use, but when I have, it\u2019s led to some pretty magical moments. My gaming is normally a personal thing, but the ability to make it social with the click of my Switch means it doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nBeing able to drop a portable game I am playing into a dock and have it show up on my television set looking even better than it did in my hands? Also very cool. It might not seem like much of a jump, going from a small 720p screen to a large 1080p display, but the higher resolution coupled with the Switch\u2019s increased processing power when docked can make quite a difference.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot I took of the recent Switch exclusive game Astral Chain in docked mode.\n\nHere is a similar shot taken in handheld mode.\n\nSee the jaggy hair and glasses? Compare the textures on the uniforms. It\u2019s night and day. And while the graphical difference might not look as dramatic when playing on a 15cm screen, many Switch games also perform better in docked mode, with better lighting effects and higher framerates. Even if 99 per cent of my Switch play is portable, I\u2019d still wonder if I was getting the most out of the games I am playing with the Lite.\n\nPlus the Switch Lite lacks a very important feature for a person like me who enjoys sharing their gameplay online. It has no external HDMI support. Not only does that mean no TV mode, it also means no connecting it to a capture card for grabbing footage or streaming. I spent years kicking around the idea of spending a couple hundred dollars to have my Nintendo 3DS modified with an HDMI port for recording and streaming. Scraping together an extra hundred for a Switch with that capability included makes perfect sense to me.\n\nPerhaps you can see the appeal of both models of Switch, and consider buying both of them to get the best of both worlds. I currently possess both a Switch and a Switch Lite. My plan is to keep the Switch proper, with its more delicate build and extra power, firmly seated in my Switch dock for television-based play. The more rugged and sturdy Switch Lite will become my travel companion, tucked into its little blue pouch and safely wrapped in a protective shell cover that I will never have to remove to disconnect a Joy-Con.\n\nI\u2019ve set up my Nintendo account on both devices. The Switch Lite is designated the \u201cprimary\u201d Switch on my account, which means I don\u2019t have to connect to the internet to verify I have permission to play games loaded on it. My \u201csecondary\u201d docked Switch has to connect to the internet before I play a game, to verify I don\u2019t currently have that gamerunning on the primary Switch. That\u2019s no problem, since it never leaves the range of my Wi-Fi router.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, your hands are probably smaller.\n\nTransferring save data between two Switches is a painless enough process, right there in the Settings menu. As long as the save belongs to the same user, you can transfer it wirelessly. Cloud saves can be downloaded between systems as well, as long as the game being saved supports the feature. Alternatively, I could just not transfer saves at all, keeping unique records on each system. That would just mean I have to level two Puzzle Quest characters at once. Oh no. Not that.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t need two Switches. You probably don\u2019t, either. But if you want to add another Switch to your family\u2019s game collection, something your kids can abuse a little bit more as they throw it into their backpacks or at their siblings\u2019 faces, the Lite might be the answer. And there are people out there who don\u2019t ever dock their Switches or remove the Joy-Cons who will be perfectly happy playing their games exclusively on a Switch Lite. But it\u2019s far from a total replacement for the existing Switch.\n\nAs I began, it\u2019s one of the finest handheld gaming devices I\u2019ve ever used. It\u2019s larger, and feels more mainstream, than the quirky 3DS. It\u2019s more rugged and earthy than Sony\u2019s precious-looking Vita. It\u2019s the sort of gaming hardware I wouldn\u2019t feel bad just tossing in a bag unprotected. It\u2019s console gaming in the palm of your hand, and you can pull it out during a rooftop party without feeling obligated to share.", "description": "The Nintendo Switch Lite is one of the finest handheld gaming devices I\u2019ve ever used.
