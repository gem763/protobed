She replaced Claire Foy, who portrayed Queen Elizabeth in the first two seasons of the hit-show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlivia revealed: \u2018I\u2019ve become a leftie monarchist, and there\u2019s not many of them about.\u2019\n\nAlways a staunch republican, Olivia now views the queen as \u2018an extraordinary human being.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018However you feel about her, she\u2019s been our constant. We are all so relaxed about her being there that one day, when she\u2019s not, it\u2019s going to be a shock.\u2019\n\nOlivia stressed the importance of fans of the show recognising it\u2019s a dramatisation of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s life and may be based on real life events, but dialogue and inner workings of the family are largely fictional.\n\nOlivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth in The Crown, season three (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018We know she loves to escape to the Highlands,\u2019 Olivia shared. \u2018She probably goes crazy up there.\n\n\u2018She must release in some way, running around naked, screaming and pulling her hair out,\u2019 she joked.\n\nOlivia then warned: \u2018If people think they\u2019re going to see the actual Queen, they can sod off. It\u2019s a drama.\u2019\n\nThe Crown season three will begin streaming on 17 November on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
