Jim Banks Demands Reddit End Censorship of Pro-Trump Community \u2018The_Donald\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) has sent a letter to Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit, highlighting political bias on his platform and demanding Reddit end censorship of \u201cThe_Donald,\u201d a user-created pro-Trump community of over 750,000 members.\n\nReddit is one of the most influential sites on the web, with as many monthly active users as Twitter and a better level of engagement than either Facebook or Twitter.\n\nThe_Donald has been \u201cquarantined\u201d by Reddit, meaning posts in the massive pro-Trump community will not appear on the site\u2019s highly popular front page for users who aren\u2019t already subscribed to the community, effectively cutting off the ability of 750,000-plus Trump supporters to reach an audience of over 5 million monthly unique visitors.\n\nIn a letter to the CEO of Reddit, Republican congressman Jim Banks has called on the site to reverse its censorship of Trump supporters, and called out the website for holding The_Donald to far higher standards than far-left Reddit communities.\n\n\u201cAlthough the initial imposition of the quarantine may have been justified, its continuation in the face of r/The_Donald\u2019s compliance with sitewide content policies and ahead of the 2020 election amounts to ideologically motivated election interference,\u201d wrote Rep. Banks.\n\n\u201cTo this point, the same content-policy violations that led to r/The_Donald\u2019s quarantine take place regularly and egregiously in numerous left-wing subreddits.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News has previously documented the censorship faced by The_Donald, as well as the site\u2019s widely-documented disregard for rule-breaking by left-wing subreddits.\n\nRep. Banks\u2019 letter doesn\u2019t merely accuse Reddit of failing to hold left-wing subreddits to the same standards as The_Donald \u2014 it provides a number of examples to prove it.\n\n\u201cAfter the controversy in Oregon, a commenter in the liberal subreddit r/Politics had the following to say about Republican legislators: \u2018Shoot these f*ckers. In the knees. For running like pieces of sh*t.\u2019 Not one of the comments that led to r/The_Donald\u2019s ban reached such a staggering level of vitriol.\u201d\n\n\u201cr/The_Donald has its share of bad apples, but the larger r/The_Donald community appears ill-disposed towards violent and hateful speech. This is made clear by the low vote scores of the comments that led to its quarantine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same cannot be said for certain subreddits that your administrative team has allowed to flourish. Last Friday, the second highest rated comment on the most popular post on the anti-police subreddit, r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut, read, \u201cF*ck the police, ACAB 1312, Build your guillotones.\u2019 As of right now, it remains undeleted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to beleaguer my point and list the thousands of unaddressed, rule-breaking comments from left-wing subreddits, but they are easy to find,\u201d concluded Rep. Banks.\n\nRep. Banks closed his letter by accusing Reddit of election interference.\n\n\u201cMr. Huffman, during a 2018 interview \u2026 you said \u2018I\u2019m confident that Reddit could sway elections,\u2019 followed by \u2018We wouldn\u2019t do it, of course.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less certain. I can\u2019t think of a more obvious and effective way to \u2018sway elections\u2019 than to hide the largest conservative forum on your site a year ahead of the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nRead Rep.
