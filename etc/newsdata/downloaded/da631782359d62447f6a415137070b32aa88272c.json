And discovering the dining hall next to my dorm during my sophomore year of college had waffle batter fresh and ready every single day, while the other sad saps on campus got it maybe once a week? Bliss. (Good thing my dorm was up a mountain is all I\u2019m gonna say about that.)\n\n[How do pancakes and maple syrup get more exciting? Turn them into a cake.]\n\nIn other words, I\u2019m a sucker for these crisp-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside breakfast staples. Then again, I\u2019m more than happy to eat them any time of day. I think you\u2019ll be just as tempted to pull out your waffle iron \u2014 or even consider buying one \u2014 to make these seven recipes from our archives. A waffle a day? Sounds good to me.\n\nCornmeal Waffles With Cheddar, Chipotle and Scallions, above. Breakfast? Breakfast for dinner? Brunch? This recipe works for any and all of the above. It also proves why it\u2019s worth thinking about waffles in a savory, rather than solely sweet, setting. The best part might be how the cheese leads to a bevy of crispy bits on the outside.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nBlueberry Corn Waffles. Like the cheddar waffles, this recipe calls for cornmeal, which adds great texture, flavor and color. You can use frozen corn and blueberries for year-round convenience.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nPumpkin Cranberry Waffles. We\u2019d like to ride into fall with a plate of these delicately spiced beauties. Fresh cranberries are just starting to show up in stores, too, so stock up.\n\n[Nine dishes to help you build the perfect fall brunch menu]\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nWhole-Grain Buckwheat Waffles. These better-for-you waffles can be made gluten-free by using brown rice flour instead of the whole-wheat kind.\n\n\n\n(Dixie D. Vereen for The Washington Post)\n\nAunt Catherine\u2019s Buckwheat-Gingersnap Waffles. Buckwheat plays a starring role in this Christmas breakfast contender. So do gingersnaps. Broken up into small pieces, the cookies lend the right amount of spice to the earthy waffles.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nCarrot Waffles With Coconut Cream. So, you want carrot cake for breakfast \u2014 and you want it to be vegan. You won\u2019t miss the cream cheese frosting once you try the fluffy coconut cream.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post; tableware from Crate and Barrel)\n\nChocolate Brownie Waffles With Blackberry Sauce. Okay, here\u2019s one more recipe that full-on channels dessert. The result is not cloying, however, and mascarpone along with blackberry sauce keep the sugar in check.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nHave your beer and cook with it, too, thanks to these 9 recipes\n\nThink beyond pie with these 6 spectacular apple dessert recipes\n\n6 spectacular sauce recipes to improve almost any meal", "description": "Round, square, sweet or savory: There's no wrong way to eat them.", "authors": ["Becky Krystal", "Reporter Covering Topics Related To Food", "October At Am", "Becky Krystal Is A Food Reporter", "The Lead Writer For Voraciously.
