Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will take center stage, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) flanking Biden. But there will also be nine other candidates onstage with them.\n\nDemocratic candidates had to raise donations from 130,000 people and earn 2 percent support in four polls approved by the Democratic National Convention between June 28 and October 1 to secure a spot. The other candidates who met those standards are: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA); entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ); former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke; California billionaire Tom Steyer; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN); former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro; and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nGoing into the debate, all eyes will be on Warren, Sanders, and Biden \u2014 and whoever decides to go on the offensive against one of them, as Castro did with Biden during the third debate.\n\nBefore last month\u2019s debate \u2014 which was the first to have all the top-polling candidates on one stage \u2014 Sanders and Warren teamed up for a two-on-one health care scuffle against Biden but didn\u2019t really engage in any contentious back-and-forth themselves. It\u2019s an open question whether that dynamic holds now that Warren, who has been consistently rising in the polls, has completely closed the gap with Biden. The two are essentially tied in the RealClearPolitics polling average in the field of 2020 Democratic contenders.\n\nThe debate will also be Sanders\u2019s first campaign event after having a heart attack on the campaign trail and undergoing an emergency procedure to insert two stents. Press reports have amped up the pressure on Sanders to perform Tuesday night and show he\u2019s able to continue his vigorous campaign style.\n\nAnd hanging over this debate is a reinvigorated impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump in Congress \u2014 one that puts Biden\u2019s family at the center of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nThe debate also could serve as a make-or-break moment for several other mid-tier candidates. Harris, Booker, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaigns have all been struggling to gain momentum, and despite donors loving Buttigieg, the Indiana mayor also hasn\u2019t seen much traction outside of a few state-level polls. The next debates have even stricter requirements; only eight have made the cut so far.\n\nThe state of the race, explained\n\nIt\u2019s still a three-way race. Still months from the February Iowa caucuses, when the first Americans will be able to vote for one of the Democratic candidates, the Democratic presidential primary remains a three-way race between a veteran of mainstream Democratic politics in Biden and two of Congress\u2019s most progressive firebrands in Warren and Sanders. The three remain far ahead of the rest of the field, though Warren has widened her lead over Sanders in national polls.\n\nWarren has been having a very good run. Warren\u2019s stock has been steadily rising since she jumped into the race, while her biggest challengers \u2014 Biden and Sanders \u2014 have been dipping or stagnant, respectively. This narrative had a symbolic peak last week when an early October Quinnipiac poll put her polling average ahead of Biden\u2019s by 0.2 percent only for Biden to inch back ahead with the another poll. Warren held a 3-percentage-point lead ahead of Biden in the early October poll from Quinnipiac, with 29 percent of the support. Her numbers show that Biden\u2019s longtime frontrunner status is certainly up for grabs.\n\nIt\u2019s still early. That said, in many state polls all three top candidates remain within the margin of error of each other, and polling experts point out that this early on a lot still comes down to name recognition.\n\n\u201cWe have basically had a tied race going back several months now,\u201d Andy Smith, a pollster with the University of New Hampshire, told Vox. \u201cPeople make up their minds at the very end.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has been registering double-digits in some state polls, inching closer to Sanders in New Hampshire and Iowa. Sanders remains strong in California and Nevada where he\u2019s in a statistical tie for first, and a recent CBS poll of early states put him in a tie in Iowa, as well. Meanwhile, the CBS poll showed Warren has surging ahead in New Hampshire, with 32 percent of support compared to Biden\u2019s 24 percent and Sanders\u2019s 17 percent. In South Carolina, however, neither Warren nor Sanders come close to Biden, who sits with a stronghold of 43 percent of support.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a clear narrative even among the top three. Fundraising totals from the third quarter put Sanders in the lead, pulling in a whopping $25.3 million haul in three months, while Biden\u2019s numbers are closer to entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u2019s than to Warren\u2019s or Sanders\u2019s. Campaigns are still building out their ground games in crucial early states, where their coalitions are overlapping.\n\nAll of this puts the race in a state of flux, and although national and local polls put Warren, Sanders, and Biden at the top of the field, many of the same polls suggest voters have not yet solidly gotten behind a single candidate.\n\nUnderlying the top-line numbers are trends that tell us more about each candidate\u2019s coalition. Biden wins overwhelmingly with voters over the age of 65 and with African American voters. Warren has won over white liberal college graduates, though she is making bigger inroads with minority voters. And Sanders is holding on to his working-class base and picks up nearly half of the youngest voters, who despite being known for lower voter turnout have been increasingly mobilized in recent elections.\n\nThe lesser-known candidates haven\u2019t had standout moments yet\n\nThe Democratic field has slimmed in the past month. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has dropped out, as has former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who has now decided he will challenge Republican Sen. Cory Gardner in the Colorado Senate race instead. Rep. Seth Moulton dropped out, as did Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has instead been elevated as Democratic candidates\u2019 climate guru.\n\nThat said, there are still seven other candidates in the race that didn\u2019t meet the polling or donation threshold to get a spot on the stage Tuesday night: author and activist Marianne Williamson; Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet; Montana Gov. Steve Bullock; former Maryland Rep. John Delaney; Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam; Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan; and former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak.\n\nGoing into the September debate, candidates like Bennet and Bullock both told the Washington Post that they weren\u2019t deterred by being shut out of the event. But missing two debates will certainly be difficult for candidates with already low national name recognition.\n\nThe debates serve as an important opportunity for smaller campaigns to get their names and message out to the rest of the country. But in the three rounds \u2014 and five nights \u2014 of debates so far, none of the breakout moments have gone to lesser-known candidates. Instead, polling shows the Democratic primary increasingly looks like a three-way race between Biden, Warren, and Sanders.\n\nWhether the lesser-known candidates will withstand missing out on two debates remains to be seen.", "description": "Can a candidate not named Biden, Warren, or Sanders have their breakout moment?", "authors": ["Tara Golshan", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uDiHZnOY_FlPI-hDhmd3Yk0c39M=/0x319:4441x2644/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19285699/GettyImages_1167620569.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
