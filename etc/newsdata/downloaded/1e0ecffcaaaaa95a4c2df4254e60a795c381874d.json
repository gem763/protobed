It will include senior security officers as well as other lawyers.\n\nThe sit-in was the culmination of 16 weeks of protests that led to army officers turning against Bashir and replacing him with a military council.\n\nProtesters stayed in the streets calling for civilian rule, until security forces moved to clear the sit-in early on June 3. Witnesses said at the time the security forces were led by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.\n\nIn August, opposition groups and the military signed a three-year power-sharing deal leading to the formation of an 11-member sovereign council and the appointment of a technocratic, transitional government under Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nThe commission will be charged with identifying those responsible for breaking up the sit-in, as well as establishing the number of dead, wounded and missing, and the financial losses incurred by those affected, SUNA reported.\n\nThe number of victims has been disputed. Doctors linked to the opposition said nearly 130 people were killed in the raid and ensuing violence. Officials have acknowledged 87 deaths.\n\nThe commission is supposed to finish its work in three months, and can be granted one-month extensions provided it submits progress reports.\n\nIt can also request technical assistance from the African Union, which has played a prominent role in Sudan\u2019s transition.", "description": "Sudan's prime minister named a commission on Sunday to investigate a raid on a sit-in in June in which security forces killed dozens near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum, following repeated calls for justice from protest and civilian groups.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
