Mark Sanford (S.C.) and Joe Walsh (Ill.) and former Gov. William Weld (Mass.) in their joint piece that was published by The Washington Post on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf a party stands for nothing but reelection, it indeed stands for nothing,\u201d they claimed. \u201cOur next nominee must compete in the marketplace of ideas, values and leadership. Each of us believes we can best lead the party. So does the incumbent. Let us each take our case to the public.\u201d\n\nThe GOP parties of Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina have all canceled their contests, citing financial reasons. It means their delegates will pledge to Trump.\n\nThe trio claimed it would be \u201ca critical mistake\u201d to allow Democrats to dominate the political conversation during the primary and caucus season.\n\n\u201cThe saying \u2018may the best man win\u2019 is a quintessential value that the Republican Party must honor if we are to command the respect of the American people,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCowards run from fights. Warriors stand and fight for what they believe. The United States respects warriors. Only the weak fear competition.\u201d", "description": "\"Warriors stand and fight for what they believe,\" wrote three of the president's Republican challengers.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7cb532240000d3267a0f8b.jpeg?cache=yfkn5ujruz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
