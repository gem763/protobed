Each candlestick has a body, and possibly an upper or lower shadow often called a wick. The highest point of the body is the candle\u2019s open, and the lowest is its close, while the top of any upper wicks shows the high for the candle and vice versa for the candle low.\n\nRelated Reading | Bears Beware: Bitcoin Price Might Range For Another Month\n\nDepending on how these candlesticks close, they can also tell crypto traders and analysts a lot about the asset\u2019s price action, such as if the trend may be coming to an end, or if there\u2019s a strong sign of continuation. Even indecision is often depicted in candle structures. Other times, candles close in succession, forming a pattern.\n\nThis past weekend, Bitcoin price closed its second consecutive red monthly candle \u2013 the first time it has done so in all of 2019.\n\nAnd while two red consecutive monthly candles aren\u2019t of much significance aside from it being the first time it\u2019s occurred since Bitcoin\u2019s bull run began, a third red monthly close would be particularly ominous.\n\nThree red long red candle closes in succession in a descending staircase like pattern, would be a strong bearish reversal candlestick pattern called \u201cthree black crows.\u201d\n\nWikipedia describes as a pattern that \u201cunfolds across three trading sessions, and consists of three long candlesticks that trend downward like a staircase.\n\n\u201cThe three black crows help to confirm that a bull market has ended and market sentiment has turned negative,\u201d the Wiki entry reads.\n\nRelated Reading | Livermore Accumulation Cylinder Suggests Bitcoin To Set New ATH Next Rally\n\nBitcoin price is currently trading above $10,100 as of the time of this writing. For this forewarning candlestick pattern to play out, bulls will need to fail in this current rally and bears will need to close Bitcoin price at $9,000 or lower. If this happens, the conditions for a \u201cthree black crows\u201d reversal pattern will be met and would suggest that Bitcoin\u2019s current bull run is over before it ever really got started.", "description": "Bitcoin price charts may be exhibiting a \u201cthree black crows\u201d candlestick pattern that suggests the bull market is already reversing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-price-three-black-crows-shutterstock_58989010-1200x780.jpg"}
