REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed\n\nThe incursion, targeting the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, has deepened a sense of alienation among people in Turkey\u2019s mainly Kurdish southeast, which is being further fuelled by a crackdown on the country\u2019s main pro-Kurdish party.\n\nDozens of people have been arrested and mayors ousted in anti-terrorism investigations since the operation began on Oct. 9, while police have prevented public statements by officials of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), including Farisogullari.\n\n\u201cOppression of our people has reached the point where even stepping outside to make the most democratic reaction faces a very harsh response,\u201d he said in the HDP building in the largest southeastern city Diyarbakir, as dozens of police stood outside.\n\nThe HDP is the only party in Turkey\u2019s parliament to oppose the offensive, and Farisogullari said locals he spoke to had expressed solidarity with Syria\u2019s Kurds.\n\n\u201cThey are our brothers. Kurds are suffering in this,\u201d said Mehmet Kesim, an unemployed man sitting in a tea house in Diyarbakir, 100 km (62 miles) north of the Syrian border.\n\nTurkey agreed under a deal clinched with Russia on Tuesday to halt its offensive here Russian military police and Syrian border guards will start removing the YPG 30 km (19 miles) from the Turkish border on Wednesday and next week Russian and Turkish forces will launch joint patrols in a narrower, 10 km \"safe zone\" Ankara has long sought in northeast Syria.\n\nAnkara views the YPG as terrorists because of their links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a 35-year insurgency in southeast Turkey, in which more than 40,000 people have died.\n\nTurkey also accuses the HDP of close links to the PKK. The HDP, the second biggest opposition party in parliament, denies ties to the PKK but does not view it as a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cEMOTIONAL FRACTURE\u201d\n\nVahap Coskun, a law academic at Diyarbakir\u2019s Dicle University, said most Turkish Kurds opposed Ankara\u2019s strategy in Syria, seeing it as part of a broader anti-Kurdish policy.\n\n\u201cThese policies which the state is implementing are seriously wearing away at people\u2019s sense of belonging, their feelings are hurt, there is an emotional fracture,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed suggestions that his ruling AK Party is out of touch with Turkey\u2019s Kurds, who make up 18% of the country\u2019s 82 million people.\n\n\u201cOf our 291 (AKP) members of parliament, 50 are of Kurdish origin,\u201d he said soon after the operation began.\n\nBut the AKP lags behind the HDP in much of southeast Turkey, winning 31% in the city of Diyarbakir in March municipal elections, about half of what its rival got.\n\nThe top AKP official in Diyarbakir, Serdar Budak, insisted that Turkish Kurds support the government\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism at home and across the border in Syria.\n\n\u201cFor three years there has been an atmosphere of peace in Diyarbakir. It is the same in the countryside. The fight against terrorism has created this atmosphere of peace,\u201d he said, sitting beneath a large photograph of Erdogan.\n\nDicle University\u2019s Coskun said the clampdown on HDP officials was exacerbating Kurds\u2019 disenchantment.\n\n\u201cAn atmosphere is being created which restricts freedoms. This atmosphere does not benefit Turkey,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday Ankara replaced four elected HDP mayors with state officials, bringing to 12 the number of mayors it has unseated over alleged links to terrorism since the March elections.\n\nThe HDP links that clampdown to the Syria operation, saying its offices across the southeast are subject to a blockade and that the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been suspended.\n\nHundreds of people have also been detained due to social media posts critical of the military offensive.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey was really thinking about peace, it would first solve the problems at home,\u201d said a young teacher in a Diyarbakir tea house, declining to give his name for fear of losing his job. \u201cThe operation is aimed at intimidating Kurds in Turkey, to punish the Kurds here.\u201d\n\nPROTEST AGAINST HDP\n\nWhile the HDP has been unable to demonstrate against the offensive and crackdown on the party, a sit-in protest against the HDP has been continuing on the doorstep of its Diyarbakir headquarters since early September.\n\nSome 20 mothers and fathers gathered there accuse the HDP of having sent their children to join PKK fighters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if he is alive or dead,\u201d said Suleyman Aydin, 39, clutching a photo of his son Ozkan adorned with a Turkish flag.\n\nOzkan was 15 when he left home to join the PKK at the time of a peace process between Ankara and the militants in 2015 - the same year a ceasefire collapsed, unleashing some of the worst fighting since the insurgency began.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nMore than 4,600 people have been killed in Turkey and northern Iraq since the conflict resumed, according to the latest International Crisis Group tally.\n\nAydin, himself Kurdish, said his house in the Diyarbakir district of Sur was destroyed in that fighting and blamed the HDP for his plight: \u201cWe gave them a chance by voting for them, but they made use of that chance to take our children away.\u201d\n\nThe HDP denies the allegations and says the protests are orchestrated by the state to demonise the party.", "description": "Kurdish lawmaker Musa Farisogullari says he has been targeted by water cannon, tear gas and blows from riot shields while trying to protest this month against Turkey's military offensive in northeast Syria.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444116882&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M16N", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
