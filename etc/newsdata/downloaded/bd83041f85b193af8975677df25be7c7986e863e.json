A bird was watching the setting sun and something in me was touched, beyond words. I felt a unique joy on seeing this magic of existence, a gift from the unknown, to an unknown.\n\nThere was a difference between the \u2018mind-state\u2019 and the \u2018Self-state\u2019. Mind-state has its mechanical memory rolls operating that keep one\u2019s thoughts glued to the past and one loses the freedom to see the present. Through \u2018positionality\u2019 it exists and tries to exert its position; in the process, there is survival that leads to pain. Thus, a pain body is created within.\n\nMind has regrets and resentments from being righteous. I call them the 3Rs. When i say \u2018righteous\u2019, i mean we are stuck in being \u2018right\u2019 with our points of view, opinions and religious beliefs and we feel virtuous with our being right. And in that sense it is \u2018righteous\u2019. The 3Rs lead to 3Ds \u2026 \u2018dissatisfaction\u2019 with the past, \u2018distaste\u2019 with the present, and \u2018distrust\u2019 of the future. Such a mind becomes a trap. This is the \u2018mind-state\u2019.\n\nA confused mind does not allow us to live in the cosmos; instead, it makes us live in chaos. Such a mind seeks escape from misery. The mind, bound to chaos, tries to escape through pleasure and entertainment.\n\nIt is not a question of whether entertainment is right or wrong. The question here is of the ground of being from where the mind operates. If one has a \u2018pain body\u2019, try to understand the psychological pain and face it, rather than escape it. Entertainment, pleasure or gossip, are all forms of escape. Such escape trails will not lead one to understand one\u2019s pain, boredom or chaos.\n\nThe future of humanity will be lost in entertainment, be it in computer games, football or some other form of escape. But you are not free from pain; you have only escaped from pain and that only makes pain stronger. Children lost in computer games grow up knowing less of themselves as they are immersed in something that is external.\n\nLife is like a ladder, to be climbed. You need not believe in the ladder, but you climb it, from the lower rung of foolishness to the higher one of wisdom.\n\nFree from preconceived thoughts, when wordlessly you experience \u2018what is\u2019, it is then that you discover a \u2018Self-state\u2019. That is, \u2018Self\u2019 is beyond an individual, beyond a position. In that dimension, it has shifted from the \u2018mind-state\u2019 to \u2018Self-state\u2019. Rather than having individuality or identity, it is a \u2018space\u2019 in which all individuality exists but it is indivisible for it is undivided by the individual. Then one experiences completeness, which is the true expression of the Self, and not the mind which is bound by its memory rolls.\n\nThe space in a room, one calls it room space. If one breaks the room, then room space is destroyed. But the room is in space, though there is space in the room. When the room is destroyed, room space is destroyed but space is not destroyed. In the same way, there is a space in which body, mind, etc exist. But the space is not limited by body and mind, even though it gives room for body and mind. That space is indivisible \u2013 Atman or \u2018Self-state\u2019. To discover that is inner awakening.\n\nBengaluru: Principles of Healing and Growth Management: Three-day residential workshop, Dec 27-29, Nirguna Mandir, Koramangala.
