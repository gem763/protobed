However, property owners and businesses may still require all patrons to wear shirts.\n\nThe Manhattan Mercury reports City Attorney Katie Jackson recommended the change to avoid potential lawsuits. She said the code could be changed again later.\n\nJackson cited a federal ruling in February 2017 that blocked Fort Collins, Colorado, from enforcing a law against women going topless. Fort Collins is in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, as is Kansas.\n\nShe said the government could still prosecute a topless woman who is acting in a lewd manner, which is against state law.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Manhattan City Commission on Tuesday unanimously decided to amend the city code to allow females to go topless.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/02/08/free_the_nipple_61809_c0-0-3000-1750_s1200x700.jpg?8fcc827e3d5c4d025cb0728722f014f10701a927", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
