Well, we still have not received the whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u201chotlined\u201d the non-binding resolution, a process to quick passage that requires no senator object to the measure.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that a formal impeachment against Trump is moving forward and said the administration must turn over the whistleblower complaint by Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s doing the best it\u2019s ever done, and I just heard she\u2019d like to impeach,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThey all say that\u2019s a positive for me in the election. You could also say who needs it. It\u2019s bad for the country.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senate Republicans on Tuesday unanimously approved a measure proposed by Democrats calling on the Trump administration to turn over to Congress the whistleblower complaint that has resulted in calls for Trump's impeachment.Every Senate Republican and Democrat voted to pass Senate Minority Leader", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BbkorjA6Wld6jg6gQfpH5A--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/be83ad1f31b48ee7675bc2d017071fc7"}
