Their latest project, \u201cTwilight State,\u201d comes as the band\u2019s first full-length album release in six years. [YONHAP]\n\nThere are many rock bands in Korea, but none are quite like YB. The five-member band - vocalist Yoon Do-hyun, guitarist Heo Jun, drummer Kim Jin-won, bassist Park Tae-hee and guitarist Scott Hellowell - have dominated the Korean rock scene since their debut in 1996, and they\u2019re back again to prove why they\u2019re No. 1.The band released their 10th full-length album \u201cTwilight State\u201d on Thursday and performed songs off the project at a press showcase held outdoors at the Oil Tank Culture Park, western Seoul on Friday prior to meeting fans in the evening at their \u201cHealing Concert 2019.\u201d The unusual outdoor setting for the press showcase was intentional, according to Yoon.\u201cThis place is called the Oil Tank Culture Park,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only do we hope to see more cultural performances take place at this place, we will also be holding a concert dubbed the \u2018Healing Concert.\u2019 It\u2019s about helping save the environment, which we also stand for. We believe it\u2019s more exciting both for the audience and for us.\u201dThe band has remained active since their debut, releasing singles and EPs over the years, but \u201cTwilight State\u201d is their first full-length album since \u201cReel Impulse\u201d was released in June 2013. And putting together their 10th album was no easy task.\u201cEvery album has its pressures, but the idea of putting a 10th album out [gave us more pressure] than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as YB, our motto is always to be honest, to express what we have inside of us. So we tried our best until the end.\u201dYoon even spent two months all alone in the mountains searching for musical inspiration for the album two years prior to its release.\u201cCreation inevitably comes with both pain and joy, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so painful and lonely while I was making it. But the joy of seeing the results - that can\u2019t be compared to anything.\u201dWhile rock bands often sing about the darker sides of life, YB\u2019s music has often been praised for its positive and optimistic messages behind the powerful sounds that often drive listeners to tears, such as songs like \u201cA Flying Butterfly\u201d (2007) and \u201cBlue Whale\u201d (2011). \u201cTwilight State\u201d is no exception, with its 13 tracks that will remind listeners of an autumn night.\u201cWe\u2019ve always made music that\u2019s hopeful and gives people the energy to move on, and we\u2019d like to keep that side of ourselves,\u201d said Heo.The album has three lead tracks because the members of the band \u201cfailed to choose just one\u201d - \u201cSangsu Station,\u201d \u201cBirthday\u201d and \u201cDistractions.\u201d Of them, \u201cSangsu Station\u201d is probably the most emotional, especially when watching the music video, which revolves around the friendship of a young boy and an old musician.\u201cWe started our music career in the 1990s, and I believe that our fans grew up with us,\u201d Yoon said.\u201cSo the old man in the video is that person who began his music in the 1990s, and the little boy is the younger generation seeing that. This kind of friendship might not be possible in real life, but we wanted to make something beautiful happen in the video.\u201dBY YOON SO-YEON [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/11201236.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
