The move followed the resignation of the company\u2019s chief financial officer, who cited family reasons, earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWithdrawing our outlook for fiscal year 2020 has been a difficult decision,\u201d said St-Louis. \u201cHowever, given the uncertainties in the marketplace, we have determined that it is the appropriate course of action. We are also placing a greater focus on profitability.\u201d\n\nShares of Hexo closed about 23 per cent lower in Toronto on Thursday, finishing the day at $3.76. Other pot producers saw declines as well, such as Tilray Inc. (down almost 13.5 per cent), Canopy Growth Corp. (down 10.8 per cent) and Aurora Cannabis Inc. (down 9.3 per cent).\n\nHexo\u2019s woes are another sign of the challenges cannabis companies face in what remains a fledgling industry. They also underscore that investors are focusing more on traditional metrics, such as revenue and profits, and reacting accordingly.\n\nThe stock has responded negatively ... given the reduced revenue visibility implied by this decision Russell Stanley, analyst, Beacon Securities\n\nAnalysts had already expressed concerns about Hexo\u2019s $400-milion revenue target prior to Thursday\u2019s retraction.\n\n\u201cWe believe downside risk exists because of the company\u2019s sales guidance for F2020 ($400MM), which could be impacted by factors outside the company\u2019s control (regulations; specifically a delay in the derivatives products market or onerous regulations),\u201d wrote CIBC World Markets analyst John Zamparo earlier this month.\n\nBeacon Securities said Thursday that it was downgrading Hexo to a hold from a buy. Analyst Russell Stanley wrote that they had been forecasting 2020 net revenue of $374 million compared to a consensus of $323 million, \u201cand we therefore believe the analyst community had come to view the guidance as aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonetheless, the stock has responded negatively \u2026 given the reduced revenue visibility implied by this decision,\u201d Stanley said.\n\n\u201cThe name of the game is profits and free cash flow and there\u2019s no sign of that ever happening for these companies.\u201d Barry Schwarts, chief investment officer, portfolio manager, Baskin Wealth Management\n\nBMO Capital Markets analysts Tamy Chen and Peter Sklar said in a note earlier this week that there \u201cmay be downside\u201d to Hexo\u2019s fourth-quarter guidance given a 50-per-cent month-over-month decline in the sales that licensed producers made to provincial retailers in July.\n\n\u201cWe believe the mid-term outlook could also be challenging as Hexo is trying to expand its dried flower sales into provinces outside of Quebec when these provinces are focused on working through their current inventory on hand,\u201d the BMO analysts wrote.\n\nHexo still has a joint venture with beermaker Molson Coors Brewing Co. to develop non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused drinks. Zamparo said they valued Hexo\u2019s stake in the JV company, Truss, at approximately $120 million.\n\n\u201cUncertainty exists in the market for cannabis-infused beverages, but Molson Coors brings invaluable expertise in distribution (and) production,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThursday\u2019s selloff, however, was all retail investors, according to Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Baskin Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cRetail investors got caught up in the excitement,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cThe name of the game is profits and free cash flow and there\u2019s no sign of that ever happening for these companies.\u201d\n\nHexo says it intends to release its complete results for the year ended July 31 on Oct. 24.\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "Now sees a near-term future that's only half as buoyant as it expected.
