They live in half-basements partially exposed to the street, in filthy neighborhoods where bugs crawl over the kitchen table and the toilet is liable to erupt. These ghetto dwellers try to climb out of the ditch they were born into, to the blessed heights where the rich people live, but the game is rigged and they\u2019ll probably fall right back into their hole again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe clever, suspenseful Parasite, from Korea\u2019s much-acclaimed director Bong Joon-Ho (Snowpiercer), is on roughly the same satiric wavelength as Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and Jordan Peele\u2019s Us. (This week it is playing at the New York Film Festival ahead of a theatrical release on October 11.) Bong considers the plight of a family from the literal underclass that, after a guest brings them a good-luck stone, starts to plot a path out of the gutter. The young man of the house, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), is asked by a friend who is leaving the country to take his place as the tutor to a cute high-school girl, Da-hye (Jung Ziso). The young fellow isn\u2019t even a college student, much less a trained tutor, but he floats along on the deception to see how far he can take it.\n\nThis turns out to be quite far: By spinning an interlocking web of scams, he manages to get not only himself but his father, mother, and sister hired to work in the household of a corporate tycoon. The guttersnipes have outfoxed the plutocrats, for once. But should the lower-class family\u2019s scheme be uncovered, they\u2019ll be ruined. They\u2019re posing as four unrelated people who just happened to get hired as tutor, art therapist, driver, and housekeeper by the rich family. As they marvel on their changed circumstances, the characters keep making note of how \u201cmetaphorical\u201d their situations are. Ya think? Bong is more frisky than angry with his idea, at least for most of the film, and a bit of droll comedy makes his harsh class-war take palatable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParasite, which captured this year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival, raises some of the same class questions as last year\u2019s winner, Shoplifters, a Japanese film by Hirokazu Kore-eda about a desperate family of schemers living in squalor but told in an idiom of naturalistic drama rather than bringing in genre elements, as Parasite unexpectedly does. As these films tend to be, Parasite is fundamentally misconceived, pressing a notion of good fortune being randomly bestowed rather than being closely linked with merit, as it is in the real world. The rich dupes in Parasite spend their time luxuriating in their gorgeous surroundings or shopping, but we never see them working. Yet if Korea is anything like the U.S., it\u2019s the richest folk who work the hardest. And Ki-woo\u2019s family is so bright and resourceful that it\u2019s hard to believe that until the good-luck stone comes into their lives, the only work any of them can find is folding pizza boxes. In order to cock a snook at supposed class injustice, artists like Bong have to fundamentally misrepresent what\u2019s going on.\n\nStill, though Parasite isn\u2019t at all subversive (diluted Marxism having played a leading role in the thinking and art of cultural elites for more than a century), Bong takes the story in some surprising and intriguing directions. Like Marx, he rails against a society where there is in-fighting among lower orders who live in a state of false consciousness about the true source of their misery. Yet just as Shoplifters conceded that its low-class antiheroes were actually horrible people, Parasite is fairly kind to the upper crust, portraying the rich as sweet if slightly daft people. Far from being melodramatically schematic, it leaves some ambiguity around the edges, raising questions it doesn\u2019t necessarily claim to be able to answer. Nor does it veer off in such a silly direction as Peele\u2019s Us does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Parasite, everything goes back to that smell; the small boy from the affluent family is the first to identify it. The poor family initially think it must be their laundry detergent that could unmask them, and resolve to wash their clothes with different brands of soap, but the truth is that living in a slum where all sorts of humiliations get visited upon them has coated them with a funk like body odor \u2014 losers\u2019 musk. The rich folk in the film gag on the scent when they\u2019re stuck in a car with the slum dwellers, so it\u2019s really there. But as befits a film that keeps telling us it\u2019s being \u201cmetaphorical,\u201d you could consider the trope in other ways. In America, a film such as this would make the underclass characters black, and being groaningly reductionist would please both race-obsessed critics and audiences who like to be clearly told which side they\u2019re supposed to root for. In societies where everybody is the same race, though, can there really be a miasma of failure that scuttles people\u2019s chances to succeed? Substitute \u201cculture\u201d for \u201codor\u201d and the film takes on a different subtext.", "description": "A Korean filmmaker delves into the eternal struggle, and cooperation, between rich and poor.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Andrew C.
