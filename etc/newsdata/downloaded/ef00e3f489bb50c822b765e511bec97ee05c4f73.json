The question is how much that premium ought to be.\n\nprices saw an exaggeration last week of the yo-yo patterns from August. Following a near 15% jump in the first session after the attack, oil sold off a chunk on the notion that there was enough supply in the world, as the United States and other governments stood ready to tap their reserves. Saudi Aramco\u2019s assurance that all lost production would be restored within weeks also gave traders the feeling the rally was overdone.\n\nTo the relief of oil bulls, still managed to record its best week since December, while WTI posted its largest weekly gain since June, with both rising about 6% on the week.\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures Weekly Chart\n\nTraders Scratch Heads On Risk Pricing\n\nWith a new week in, traders are scratching their heads again on what would be the appropriate risk pricing for oil. And there are many variables to muddy that outlook.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that foreign diplomats were warned by Houthi militants in Yemen that Iran was preparing a follow-up strike to last week\u2019s air raids on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq crude processing plant and Khurais oil field. Houthi rebels initially claimed responsibility for the Sep. 14 attack but the United States blamed Iran instead \u2014 a charge the Islamic Republic has denied.\n\nHouthi claims have long been met with skepticism by Western officials and the latest warning couldn\u2019t be independently verified, the Journal reported, quoting people familiar with the matter.\n\nHouthis Make Suspicious Claim Of Forthcoming Iran Attack\n\nThat the Houthis, who are diehard allies of Iran, would prefer to alert the world to such an attack instead of carrying it out is bewildering. According to the Journal, the Yemen-based rebels ratted on Tehran because they were being pressed to play a role in the upcoming strike. That makes the whole affair sound even more incredible.\n\nNotwithstanding the Houthi claims, the Trump administration said on Friday it was sending additional troops, along with enhanced air and missile defense systems, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as precaution. Many military strategists believe the UAE, a staunch Saudi ally, would likely be the next target for an attack.\n\nIran, meanwhile, maintains its innocence, and has vowed an \u201call-out war\u201d if the U.S. or Saudi Arabia were to push it into battle.\n\nU.N. Assembly High On Oil Market\u2019s Radar\n\nThe start of important speeches at the U.N. assembly this week adds to oil market uncertainty. With both U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian leader Hassan Rouhani set to address the assembly and hold meetings on the sidelines, there are chances for more fiery speeches, on-the-fly policy making and buildup of tensions.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Trump continues to hold out hope for a meeting with Rouhani to resolve the Iranian sanctions situation that could defuse much of the current crisis in the Middle East. But Rouhani\u2019s aides are resisting such a meeting, on the concern that their president will come away empty-handed \u2014 earning the ire of the Iranian people \u2014 while Trump gets top marks for trying. With the 2020 U.S. election year closing in on Trump, he's doing all he can to burnish his credentials as a dealmaker.\n\nAll this makes the right geopolitical premium for oil anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nRisk Premiums For WTI, Brent Relatively Modest\n\nDominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute in New York, noted that despite the drama sparked by the Saudi attack, WTI\u2019s premium on the week was a modest $3.65 per barrel versus Brent\u2019s $4.68.\n\nChirichella said:\n\n\u201cDespite Saudi Arabia fully supplying their customers, the market is not ready to declare all back to normal.\u201d \u201cWith all signs pointing to Iran as the source of the attack, market participants remain concerned that further action could occur with the potential for additional supply interruptions.\u201d\n\nLack Of Clarity On Oil Supply\n\nExactly how much supply will be available in coming months is an enigma to traders.\n\nAramco says half of the 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production initially lost from Abqaiq was restored in days, and the balance will be back online by the end of September. Industry analysts are skeptical about this.\n\nRepairs at Abqaiq will likely take months to complete, consultant FGE said in a Sep. 18 report. Full restoration of pre-attack capacity could stretch till the year-end, Rystad Energy, another consultancy, said.\n\nAramco is unlikely to acknowledge such views even if they\u2019re right, for fear of damaging its upcoming share sale. The Aramco IPO has been beset with woes since it was conceived in 2016 as persistent bear markets in oil and other challenges have frustrated aims to value the firm at a world record of $2 trillion. In a strong push last week, Aramco for the listing, showing its determination to move on from the Sep. 14 attack.\n\nSurge In U.S. Production Despite Slump In Shale Drilling\n\nAnother thing that's key to oil\u2019s risk pricing is, of course, is U.S. drilling.\n\nAs of Friday, industry firm Baker Hughes\u2019 weekly survey of the U.S. oil drilling landscape showed the number of actively-deployed rigs falling by 14 to reach 724, the lowest since May 2017.\n\nDespite such drops in drilling activity, remains in an overall uptrend, setting new records on a weekly basis.\n\nTotal output is now about 12.7% above where it stood the same week a year ago. The U.S. Energy Information Administration latest weekly dataset shows production at 12.4 million bpd, just slightly below under its all-time record high.\n\nPut it another way: The U.S. upstream sector has 55% fewer drilling rigs but is producing nearly 40% more oil than during the highs of October 2014.\n\nGold Sits Pretty At $1,500 \u2026 For Now\n\nIn , the story is somewhat the same as oil as the yellow metal returned to its $1,500 perch after longs in the market priced in the political risk from the Saudi attack and potential for a global recession if the U.S.-China trade war continues to drag.\n\nGold Futures Weekly Chart\n\nNotwithstanding the bullish , gold remains the safe haven of choice and top macro trade for anyone worried about plumbing U.S. bond yields.\n\nis up almost 18% on the year while gold futures show a gain of about 16% after weathering choppy moves last week from another mild quarter point by the Federal Reserve.\n\nGold was in a better place last month as it effortlessly hit 6-year highs and seemed ready to even cross into $1,600 territory from a rally that began in June.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Barani Krishnan/Investing.com covering: XAU/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures, Brent Oil Futures.
