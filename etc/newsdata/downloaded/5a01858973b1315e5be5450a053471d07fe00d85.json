The work is in support of the space agency's $20-30 billion moon-landing program, called Artemis.\n\nArtemis currently calls for housing astronauts inside a moon-orbiting space station called the Gateway. That way, there'd be a helpful pit stop between the lunar surface and Earth. In the more distant future, the Gateway may serve as a stepping stone to Mars.\n\nBigelow is interested in helping NASA with both goals using the B330.\n\n\"It is important to listen to what President Trump has been saying about Mars. The way to Mars is to the moon. The way to the moon is through the Gateway,\" Bigelow said in a statement provided to Business Insider ahead of the unveiling. \"The B330 is an exploration destined space station, and we are excited about its future.\"\n\nBigelow Aerospace built out its demo unit to house astronauts for three days, and the company provided interior pictures of its setup.
