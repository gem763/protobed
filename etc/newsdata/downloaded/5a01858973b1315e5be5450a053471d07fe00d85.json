As part of a two-week ground test for NASA, astronauts will spend three days inside trying it out.\n\nThe test unit is an early prototype of the B330, a habitat Bigelow wants NASA to use for its Artemis moon-landing program and, later on, travel to Mars.\n\n\"Equipped with two galleys, two toilets, enormous cargo space, and two dissimilar propulsion systems, this is the ideal habitat for a long-duration space mission,\" Bigelow said.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe hotel mogul Robert Bigelow wants to take his idea of building inflatable space habitats and run with it \u2014 apparently, all the way to the moon and Mars.\n\nOn Thursday, the billionaire unveiled Bigelow Aerospace's latest model of an expandable space-station prototype, the Bigelow Mars Transporter Testing Unit. The mock-up has the volume of four 40-foot-long cargo containers and was built in part for NASA astronauts and engineers to try.\n\nBigelow's immediate goal is to persuade NASA, which is testing prototypes made by four other companies, to fund a space-worthy unit, called the B330 (so named because it would have 330 cubic meters of volume). The work is in support of the space agency's $20 billion to $30 billion Artemis moon-landing program.\n\nArtemis currently calls for housing astronauts inside a moon-orbiting space station called the Gateway. That way, there'd be a helpful pit stop between the lunar surface and Earth. In the more distant future, the Gateway may serve as a stepping stone to Mars.\n\nBigelow is interested in helping NASA with both goals using the B330.\n\n\"It is important to listen to what President Trump has been saying about Mars. The way to Mars is to the moon. The way to the moon is through the Gateway,\" Bigelow said in a statement to Business Insider ahead of the unveiling. \"The B330 is an exploration destined space station, and we are excited about its future.\"\n\nBigelow Aerospace built its demo unit to house astronauts for three days, and the company provided interior pictures of its setup.
