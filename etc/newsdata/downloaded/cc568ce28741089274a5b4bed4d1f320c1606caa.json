All these questions are relevant, but the answers \u2013 at least for now \u2013 remain just theories and possible outcomes. We focused on one of the major, specific adoption questions and got expert opinions on it: what would encourage an average person who is satisfied with the current monetary, financial system to start using Bitcoin?\n\nCryptonews.com had an opportunity to discuss this point with some of the major figures in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, who attended the Baltic Honeybadger conference held this September in Riga, Latvia. We've asked the question, and these are the answers they've given us.\n\nWatch the interviews or read a quick summary below.\n\nWhat would encourage people to use Bitcoin\n\nA triggering event caused by friction in the system\n\nThe current system is certainly not perfect and constant issues are bound to make a person feel frustrated. \u201cI think that the main reason someone would start looking into Bitcoin,\u201d says Jameson Lopp, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of crypto security specialist Casa, \u201cis because of a triggering event, and usually it means they\u2019ve done something where they encountered friction in the system.\u201d The CTO gives an example of a first-hand experience with declined credit cards, the reason being that they are not in \u201cthe right country.\u201d Another example is a grey or a frowned-upon industry, such as sex or cannabis industries, which are \u201cstill mostly locked out of the financial system in America\u201d and which will \u201cstart looking for alternatives.\u201d However, there is no real incentive to look into alternative options for \u201cthe people who fit nicely in the bucket of the existing financial system,\u201d says Lopp.\n\nPeople, particularly business owners, will find many aspects of the existing banking system disruptive. \u201cBanks are not fun to deal with,\u201d Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at the Canada-based blockchain company Blockstream, Samson Mow, told us. \u201cYou can have your account frozen at any time. Even if you're not touching crypto.\u201d As an example, Mow gave an issue a gaming company, Pixelmatic faced about a year ago, when, despite the submitted paperwork, its account was frozen \u201cjust because they [the bank] were backlogged in doing a new KYC [know your customer] check.\u201d These sorts of issues are very disruptive, he says.\n\nThe wire transfer system \u201cis very bad,\u201d says Mow, and while Europe has separate transfers, \u201celsewhere you're doing normal wire transfers; you have SWIFT codes, routing numbers, intermediary banks, and fees on both sides,\u201d he explains, adding that \u201cit's really a no-brainer if you're dealing with that system and you see Bitcoin \u2013 it's so simple.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of business owners, Alex Petrov, Chief Information Officer (CIO) at blockchain technology group Bitfury, told Cryptonews.com that in the existing financial system, most people are using the technology just for payments, and \u201cBitcoin will be approximately the same \u2013 so, running a mining operation, running financial operation, is like running a business operation,\u201d he says. Petrov further explains that \u201cif you would like to provide financial services, you\u2019re creating the business, and most of the users don\u2019t need to create the business \u2013 they own their own businesses, so they need just payment tools to perform the transactions, and receive the invoices.\u201d\n\nFocusing on the store of value aspect of Bitcoin\n\nDirector of Business Development at Kraken, Dan Held, said that he thinks people should use crypto to store value. 'Store of value' doesn't mean 'price-stable', he explained, but that it\u2019s \u201chard to seize and immutable among other factors, so BTC represents a really good asset that people should use if they feel fearful about someone more powerful taking their value away from them,\u201d says Held, adding that he\u2019s not sure if the asset is useful for payments at the moment. These BTC\u2019s characteristics are \u201ctremendously valuable for people in any country, but especially in the countries where the governments or the economic systems are much worse off than Western developed nations,\u201d he concluded.\n\nFounder of Bitcoin Advisory, co-founder of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, Pierre Rochard (he has also recently joined Kraken, where he'll focus on education and open source development), thinks that it doesn\u2019t make sense to make Bitcoin compete on just payment. Instead, it's important to focus on the savings aspect of the crypto. The current payment system is excellent, he thinks, which comes with some bad trade-offs, such as worse privacy and user autonomy, as well as less self-sovereignty, but also with some good trade-offs, such as consumer protection, reversible payments, the stability of the day-to-day value of most fiat currencies, \"and also just the convenience of it and the instantaneous aspect of it.\"\n\nThe realization that BTC\u2019s value has gone up over the last 5 or 10 years is what attracts people to Bitcoin the most, he says. There has been a lot of volatility, so it all comes down to \u201cis the return greater than volatility,\" know as the Sharpe ratio, and BTC has a higher Sharpe ratio than many other assets. \"Owning BTC means you're going to make a higher risk-adjusted return than any other asset,\" Rochard told Cryptonews.com.\n\nPeople theorize that Facebook's Libra or central banks-issued crypto could become the currency for payment, but Rochard thinks that these entities will \u201cmake existing centralized fiat systems more efficient,\" so that they can say that they use crypto for a small part of it. However, \"it won't be the main thrust of what they want the future of the payment system to look like,\" given that centralized governments and private corporations want everything to be centrally controlled and fully transparent to the government. But \"even though governments and private corporations are going to be creating stablecoins, they can become a payment system rails that people actively use,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cultimately, they're going to cripple themselves by the fact that they do have a centralized control over it.\u201d\n\nThe need to change the current sinking base layer of civilization\n\nBitcoin doesn't appeal to people who are satisfied with the current system, but to those to whom it's a necessity, explains Bitcoin Core developer and entrepreneur, Jimmy Song. It\u2019ll take time for the general public to understand the benefits of Bitcoin, but people also need to realize the importance of money in any civilization \u2013 that it\u2019s its foundation. \"Bitcoin is money,\u201d Song says, and \u201cevery civilization that we know of had some sort of money.\" It's needed for a civilization to function, or some of its vital aspects would be missing, such as the division of labor. Hence, he finds, \"money is a base layer of civilization.\" The current base layer, however, is \"constantly sinking,\u201d so \u201cby changing that base layer, you improve civilization significantly.\" And while the transition to Bitcoin as \u201ca better money\u201d will be long and painful, \u201conce it's over, I think everyone will appreciate how much it's changed everything.\"\n\n___\n\nLearn more:\n\nImagine Separation of Money and State\n\n7 Biggest Misconceptions About Bitcoin\n\n10 Main Trends in Digital Assets this Year", "description": "We focused on one of the major, specific adoption questions and got expert opinions on it: what would encourage an average person who is satisfied with the current monetary, financial system to start using Bitcoin?", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107", "Eimantas \u017demaitis", "Linas Kmieliauskas"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/15b6f87737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
