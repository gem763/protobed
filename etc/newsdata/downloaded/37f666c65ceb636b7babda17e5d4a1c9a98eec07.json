But the more assertive policymaking is likely to be driven by her vice president for digital, the Google-thumping antitrust czar Margrethe Vestager.\n\nFor some (particularly in France and Germany), the move can't come soon enough. Over the past decade, EU lawmakers and executives from legacy industries have looked on warily as U.S. \u2014 and, increasingly, Chinese \u2014 tech companies have outmuscled the region's firms in the digital Great Game.\n\nLondon, Berlin and Paris can all claim their fair share of startups worth at least $1 billion. But these figures are still dwarfed by those of Silicon Valley and China. The ongoing distrust in many EU policy circles of U.S. tech giants and their dominance over everything from social media and online search to cloud computing and e-commerce also has rekindled a protectionist zeal that many thought had been discarded long ago.\n\nVon der Leyen has set the bullish tone for the new Commission. But the more assertive policymaking is likely to be driven by her executive vice president for digital, the Google-thumping antitrust czar Margrethe Vestager, and whoever ultimately fills the job of internal market commissioner following the rejection of French pick Sylvie Goulard.\n\nParis' new nominee for the job, ex-Finance Minister Thierry Breton, is a forceful advocate of much more protective policies on everything from data localization \u2014 he\u2019s said that European data should stay in Europe \u2014 to fostering EU-born digital champions. That's not surprising with his background as the former head of France's ex-telecoms monopoly and boss at Atos, a French tech and cybersecurity firm.\n\nEurope \u201cneed[s] a digital policy and a real industrial policy at European level,\" Breton, who still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament, told French business daily Les Echos earlier this year.\n\nHe\u2019s also taking aim at Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cMy conviction is that these empires will not be able to stay as they are,\" Breton added in a shot across the bow at digital giants like Google and Facebook. They \"capture too much value.\"\n\nDigital hearts and minds\n\nWhat's at stake here is a gear-shift in European digital policymaking \u2014 which lawmakers have eagerly exported to the rest of the world (excluding China) via tougher privacy standards, competition rulings and calls for tighter policing of online content.\n\nThose moves helped to establish Brussels as a global first-mover on tech regulation, as Washington largely stood still.\n\nBut they did little to improve Europe\u2019s standing in the global digital race against China and the United States. Alarmed by Europe\u2019s ever-growing dependence on foreign tech companies, a new generation of policymakers embodied by von der Leyen wants to take things a step further \u2014 by taking more active measures to protect Europe\u2019s market.\n\nThey see how China and, to a lesser extent, the United States have used economic policies to promote national digital champions. The thinking in Brussels now holds that, if Washington and China are throwing out the rulebook on international trade and support for home-grown industry, Europe might as well start getting more assertive, too.\n\nThat means using every trick in the book to give the 28-member bloc a fighting chance to compete globally, including blocking potential foreign takeovers in so-called strategic industries, promoting government-funded tech initiatives and rewriting antitrust rules to allow local players to gain global scale to take on foreign competitors.\n\nAs more of the economy is powered by online data, EU policymakers are questioning why most of these valuable data flows run on digital infrastructure owned by the likes of Amazon and Google.\n\nParis and Berlin are throwing their weight behind this approach. They believe in a more aggressive pushback to the dominance of foreign (read: American) firms over vast sections of the digital economy.\n\nUp until now, these instincts had been kept mostly in check by more liberally economic EU countries, notably the United Kingdom. But in a quirk of fate, Britain's pending departure of the bloc has dampened protests to more interventionist digital rule-making, with many smaller countries (that often house tech giants' European headquarters) feeling less emboldened to fight their corner.\n\n\"We need France and Germany's support on a range of things, including on Brexit,\" said a senior EU diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \"We care about what happens to the digital economy. But we care about other priorities more.\"\n\nProtectionism in all but name\n\nEurope's technological sovereignty is already taking shape.\n\nAs more of the economy is powered by online data, EU policymakers are questioning why most of these valuable data flows run on digital infrastructure owned by the likes of Amazon and Google. The fear is that such U.S. dominance of so-called cloud computing could leave the region vulnerable to lax privacy standards and see local competitors miss out on an industry that is expected to be worth half a trillion dollars globally by 2023, according to IDC, a data provider.\n\nAlready, the Germans and French have thrown their backing behind Gaia-X, an EU-backed cloud-hosting service, to reduce the region's reliance on foreigners. The countries' joint efforts to create a European rival to Google, known as Quaero, were quietly scrapped in 2013 after receiving millions of euros in government grants with little, if any, impact on the search giant's dominance.\n\nFor Michael Jackson, an American venture capitalist who has spent more than a decade living in Europe, such plans epitomize the region's ham-fisted tactics to help the local digital economy.\n\nParis also recently enlisted two local firms to draw up plans to break the U.S. dominance of cloud computing with proposals expected to be published in December \u2014 an initiative in line with Breton\u2019s thinking on data localization (the likes of Russia, Turkey and Brazil had passed similar rules). A separate push by Orange, the country's largest telecoms carrier, failed to gain much traction and will be shut down in early 2020.\n\nFor Michael Jackson, an American venture capitalist who has spent more than a decade living in Europe, such plans epitomize the region's ham-fisted tactics to help the local digital economy.\n\nOfficials already have all the powers they need to help local startups grow. They could revamp the Continent's complicated labor laws that vary widely between countries, overhaul how workers for fledgling companies pay tax on potentially lucrative stock options and invest heavily in the region's often creaking digital infrastructure.\n\nBut such practical policymaking doesn't win headlines or votes. So European policymakers are reverting to type by promoting a 21st century version of protectionism that keeps foreigners out and which, he says, will mostly help traditional companies just as they're facing increased competition from upstart digital rivals.\n\n\"It's blatant protectionism,\" said Jackson, who's behind a new project in Paris to help local startups gain a footing. Technological sovereignty \"is clearly for the benefit of legacy players, not to help Europe compete. It's the same old story that we've heard before.\"\n\nMark Scott is chief technology correspondent at POLITICO.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
