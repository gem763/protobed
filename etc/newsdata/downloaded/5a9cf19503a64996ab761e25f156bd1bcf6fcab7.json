They\u2019ve been fighting each other for centuries. They\u2019re bitter enemies, possibly always will be.\u201d\n\nAsked what will happen if the forces of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan slaughter the Kurds, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cIf he does it unfairly, he\u2019s going to pay a very big economic price. I will wipe out his economy if that happens. I hope that he will act rationally.\u201d\n\nThe fighting began after Mr. Trump assured Mr. Erdogan that he was removing the small number of U.S. forces from northern Syria, where the Americans were supporting the Kurds against Islamic State fighters.\n\n\u201cWe have no soldiers in the area,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe are out of there. I feel that we are doing the right thing, and I think the country feels that, too. I campaigned on ending the endless wars.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds had been guarding captured Islamic State prisoners, and the new Turkish offensive has raised concerns that the terrorists will escape to carry out more attacks against the West.\n\nMr. Trump said U.S. forces have moved some of the most dangerous Islamic State, or ISIS, captives to other locations.\n\n\u201cWe are taking some of the most dangerous ISIS fighters out,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken them out, and we\u2019re putting them in different locations where it\u2019s secure.\u201d\n\nHe predicted some of the Islamic fighters will find their way back to Europe.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes. Europe didn\u2019t want them from us, we could have given [Islamic State captives] to them, they could have had trials, they could have done whatever they wanted. \u2026 Those countries didn\u2019t want to take them back, so that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
