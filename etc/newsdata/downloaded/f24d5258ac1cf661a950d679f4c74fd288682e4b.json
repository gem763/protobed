Boeing did not admit liability in its 11 settlements, Wisner said.\n\nThe claims are the first to be settled out of some 55 lawsuits against Boeing in US federal court in Chicago and could set the bar for mediation talks by other Lion Air plaintiffs' lawyers that are scheduled through next month, three people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWisner said he could not disclose the amount of the settlements because of a confidentiality agreement with Boeing.\n\nThe three people familiar with the matter said families of Lion Air victims, who were nearly all from Indonesia, are set to receive at least $1.2 million each. That amount would be for a single victim without any dependents.\n\nRead more: The Boeing 737 Max has had a troubled existence that culminated in 2 fatal crashes just 5 months apart. Here is the complete timeline of the besieged jetliner, from its birth to the present day.\n\nThe people spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.\n\nAwards can vary according to victims' nationality, age, marital status, income, dependents and life expectancy. The Lion Air victims were mainly from Indonesia, where incomes and crash awards tend to be lower than in the United States.\n\nThe manufacturer is also facing nearly 100 lawsuits over an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash on March 10 that killed 157 people on its way from Addis Ababa to Nairobi.\n\nLawsuits over both crashes highlight the role of MCAS automated software that pushed the nose of the two planes lower. They claim that design flaws allowed erroneous sensor data to set off the automated system and overwhelm pilots.\n\nThe Lion Air lawsuits are being mediated before Donald O'Connell, a retired judge of the Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois, a jurisdiction often used for air accidents situated in Chicago, where Boeing is based.\n\n\"Common link\"\n\nLawyers for the Ethiopian Airlines crash are pushing for a jury trial in US federal court in Chicago, demanding to know why Boeing allowed the 737 Max to go on flying after the Lion Air incident.\n\nThe planemaker has said it is sorry for the lives lost in both crashes but has stopped short of admitting any fault in how it developed the 737 Max or the software.\n\nIt has said the two crashes - like most air disasters - were caused by a chain of events, with a common link between the two Max accidents being \"erroneous activation\" of MCAS.\n\nIn the Lion Air case, families of victims who were married with one to three children could receive between $2 million and $3 million, the people said.\n\nIndustry veteran Wisner said he had settled lawsuits for other plane crashes that took place in Indonesia in years prior to the Lion Air 737 Max crash for around $500,000 or $600,000. He will receive one third of his Lion Air settlements in fees.\n\nThe settlements come on top of $144,500 that Boeing is paying out of a $50 million financial assistance fund it set up in July for families of victims of the two crashes.\n\nAny settlement or jury award in the Ethiopian cases is likely to be larger than for Lion Air, the people said.\n\nMany of the Ethiopian crash victims, who came from 35 different countries, included United Nations employees and young working adults in their twenties or thirties. There were nine US citizens among the victims.\n\nBoeing is also the target of a US Department of Justice criminal investigation into the development of the 737 Max.\n\nRead more: The 737 Max will be the safest plane in the skies once it starts flying again\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded worldwide following the Ethiopian crash while Boeing develops software updates and new pilot training. It has already estimated a cost of more than $8 billion from the grounding, mainly due to production setbacks and compensation it will owe airlines that have canceled thousands of flights as they manage schedules without the fuel-efficient jetliner they had counted on.\n\nBoeing has said it hopes the 737 Max jetliner will fly again in the United States early in the final quarter of this year.", "description": "Boeing does not admit liability in the 11 settlements, according to a plaintiff's lawyer.
