It all came in piping hot and the staff were quite happy to stand and have a photo with me.\n\n\"People are still gob smacked with it, people think that as a buffet you have to have like sandwiches and stuff and I don\u2019t really like pasties and I\u2019m not picking them because everyone else likes them.\u201d\n\nThe couple said that when they first told people about their plans, that guests were a little sceptical. Victoria said that friends and family were certain in the run up to the wedding that she was just \"winding them up\".\n\nShe says that even her hairdresser on the day was still questioning whether they were actually going to be offering pizza in place of a traditional wedding breakfast.\n\nBut the couple said that all doubt was quickly withdrawn when the smell of fresh pizza and garlic bread filled their wedding venue.\n\nThe bride said that people turned to praising the couple throughout the day for their unique decision and there wasn't a displeased guest in sight.\n\n\"I was surprised at the amount they delivered, I thought 'we're going to have to take this home and have it for a couple of weeks',\" she said.\n\n\"We would have ended up having to bin it which would have been devastating for me.\n\n\u201cI would normally order it at least once a week and I definitely wont be for a little bit. I don\u2019t want to see anymore pizzas for a while.\u201d\n\nDid you opt for an unusual wedding buffet?
