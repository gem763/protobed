They thought 2020 was the better solution to oust the president. They didn\u2019t want to make it worse for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime liberal firebrand now tasked with steering a caucus featuring diverse opinions on the topic. They know how an ill-led attempt to get rid of the president could come back to bite their party\u2019s own 2020 prospects.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThen came last week\u2019s explosive allegation that Trump attempted to pressure Ukrainian officials to sway the next election, and with it an avalanche of fresh public statements that it\u2019s time for Trump to face the full force of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt makes breaking into the Watergate seem kind of like kid\u2019s play,\u201d Neera Tanden, the longtime Hillary Clinton aide who also served in the Obama administration, told POLITICO when asked about her public shift last week from simply backing the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into a full-blown member of the pro-impeachment crowd.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a people who are perpetually outraged about things, but this sort of took it to a whole new level,\u201d explained Lu, a former top Obama White House aide and deputy Labor secretary.\n\nLongtime Hillary Clinton aide Neera Tanden told POLITICO, \u201cIt makes breaking into the Watergate seem kind of like kid\u2019s play.\" | Larry French/Getty Images for MoveOn\n\nObama aides often celebrate how, over eight years, they avoided the kinds of administration-crippling scandals that plagued their Clinton predecessors, though they didn\u2019t survive unscathed either: Fast and Furious, Solyndra and Benghazi became household terms thanks to GOP-led oversight efforts.\n\nIn an interview, Lu said that he spent Friday stewing over whether the institutional forces of congressional oversight and the next election were enough to properly check Trump \u2014 before deciding over dinner with his wife that the answer was no. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics but doing what\u2019s right,\u201d he finally wrote on social media.\n\nOther ex-Democratic luminaries described coming to similar realizations.\n\n\u201cWhen the facts changed, I changed my mind,\u201d said Carville, the ex-Clinton senior strategist who played a lead role as an attack dog defending the Democratic president against a GOP-led 1998-99 impeachment effort.\n\nCarville said he\u2019d been of the view, before last week, that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia findings were \u201chorrific\u201d but still best dealt with in 2020. Now, he\u2019s suggesting Democrats speed a single article of impeachment through the House describing how Trump contacted a foreign government to urge it to find dirt on a political opponent, a move that would then put the ball in the court of several vulnerable 2020 Senate Republicans.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see Sens. [Susan] Collins, [Martha] McSally, [Thom] Tillis, [Cory] Gardner, [Joni] Ernst and [Mitch] McConnell all stew on it,\u201d Carville said.\n\nThis new wave of Obama and Clinton alumni backing impeachment recognize they have no vote on the matter. Still, party leaders and Democratic lawmakers in the thick of the investigation say their newly found positions carry weight, considering their past work in the trenches of White House politics and policy \u2014 and because a raft of newly elected lawmakers may not be so familiar with the nuances of Watergate or the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\n\u201cHaving influential people raise their voices reinforces that every factor is pointing toward taking stronger action,\u201d said Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to Gore and Vice President Joe Biden who argues that the latest developments involving Trump and the Ukraine \u201cadd more urgency\u201d to the need to impeach the president.\n\nFrom a practical vote-getting standpoint, there\u2019s another benefit to having so many of these former administration officials weigh in. Many used to work with people who are now serving themselves in Congress.\n\n\u201cIf we hesitate to impeach a president for this, we might as well pass an amendment removing the impeachment clause from the Constitution, and become a popular, not constitutional, republic,\u201d freshman Rep. Tom Malinowski, who worked as a top State Department official during the Obama administration, wrote last Friday in a series of tweets taking issue with Trump\u2019s Ukraine behavior. The New Jersey Democrat, whose swing district includes the president\u2019s country club at Bedminster, added that if the Ukraine allegations were proven true \u201cthere is only one remedy.\u201d\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly 9AM on SEPT. 24 for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly ADD TO GOOGLE CALENDAR\n\nAnother former Democratic official, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, made an ever-so-slight shift in position on Friday in the wake of the latest news reports. The New Jersey lawmaker who once wrote speeches for President Clinton called for an \u201cimmediate and thorough investigation\u201d into Trump\u2019s dealings with the Ukraine, while adding \u201cno foreign country should ever be allowed to interfere in our domestic politics. Congress has a responsibility to conduct strong oversight, and we must fulfill our article 1 constitutional obligations in this matter and others.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for Pelosi and House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler did not comment when asked about the wave of new Obama and Clinton alumni who have joined the impeachment bandwagon. But Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of Nadler\u2019s panel leading the impeachment push, said the former administration officials can influence their Democratic colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe more establishment voices increase the volume of the chorus,\u201d Raskin told POLITICO, adding that he\u2019s seen a \u201cpervasive spread within the Democratic caucus and Democratic party of the sense to counter the lawlessness coming from the White House.\u201d\n\nOne group not participating in the impeachment push: The party\u2019s living ex-presidents. All three have tried up to now to stay out of the impeachment spotlight, and former aides to both Obama and Clinton said they don\u2019t expect that to change anytime soon. \u201cIt\u2019s just not their style,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton dating back to her tenure as a New York senator.\n\nAs for Jimmy Carter, the 94-year old Democrat told Fox Business News in August 2018, \u201cI think that\u2019s the wrong thing for Democrats to do.\u201d\n\nBut impeachment has been fair game for many other senior Democrats. \u201cThe president asked a foreign power to help win an election. Again,\u201d Hillary Clinton wrote on Friday on Twitter in response to the Ukraine scandal.\n\nWhile her social media post didn\u2019t mention impeachment, it echoed a more expansive line of arguments the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee made in a Washington Post op-ed published in April when the Mueller report was dominating the headlines. There, Clinton called it a \u201cfalse choice\u201d for lawmakers to think they needed to respond to the special counsel\u2019s findings as \u201cimmediate impeachment or nothing.\u201d\n\nInstead, she urged Congress to use Mueller\u2019s findings as a \u201croad map\u201d to consider impeachment while adding that his report included a \u201cwarning about the future\u201d where foreign adversaries including Russia, China and North Korea keep trying to meddle in American elections.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\n\u201cAnd unless he\u2019s held accountable, the president may show even more disregard for the laws of the land and the obligations of his office,\u201d wrote Clinton, who noted the \u201cstrange twist of fate\u201d in her own one-of-a-kind resume that includes stints as a young House Judiciary Committee staff attorney during its Watergate impeachment inquiry and more than two decades later as a first lady whose husband faced impeachment.\n\nGore, the former vice president whose own unsuccessful 2000 White House campaign was weighed down by the Bill Clinton impeachment saga, said in an interview with MSNBC last week just before the Ukraine whistleblower story broke that he too understands the political calculus Democrats face on the subject, including the GOP-led Senate composition that would make a vote to convict and remove Trump a long shot at best.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have an obligation beyond all of that to the Constitution, and the only remedy for these serious crimes that have been alleged is the impeachment process,\u201d said Gore, who also represented Tennessee in both the House and Senate.\n\nOn Monday, Gore responded to the latest news reports by telling CNN that Trump\u2019s conversations with the Ukrainian president \u201cmust be investigated thoroughly. \u201cAnd this latest accusation, like some of the others, falls into a rare category. The only remedy is an impeachment investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nSome members of the Democratic administration alumni club have been banging the impeachment gong for months.\n\n\u201cA well-planned and well-executed impeachment inquiry may be the only way to wrest the microphone from Trump and tell a story on our terms about who Trump is and the damage he has wrought on our country,\u201d former Obama White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer wrote in May.\n\nOthers have tried to lay low, avoiding the use of the I-word however they can. John Kerry, the former Obama secretary of state and Massachusetts senator, for example studiously skipped over mentioning the process during an MSNBC interview Monday where he also described his reaction as \u201cone of absolute shock and amazement\u201d when he learned the at-issue call between Trump and his counterpart in Kiev happened the day after Mueller testified to Congress.\n\n\u201cWe need to see the institutions of our country stand up here. Americans rely on that,\u201d Kerry explained before calling for Republicans to break ranks and speak up against the president on the topic.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

It\u2019s meant fending off the label they were going after Pelosi, the speaker who played a crucial role in passing Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to thread the needle of being pro-impeachment and not attacking Speaker Pelosi,\u201d said Reines, himself an outspoken supporter of impeaching Trump for much of this year.\n\nSeveral new members of the pro-impeachment club said in interviews they recognized the political peril of what they were doing. They personally know many of the freshman Democrats elected in 2018 from swing districts that backed Trump two years ago. They know about the long-shot prospects in the Senate, as well as the argument Trump allies keep making that impeachment will turn the public against Democrats and help the president win a second term.\n\n\u201cI think now it\u2019s worth the risk,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a former Clinton White House spokesman who last Friday made his pro-impeachment stance known after earlier this year publishing an op-ed in the New York Times arguing that it\u2019d be better to leave Trump in office because it was the \u201cbest way to cement Trumpism\u2019s hold on the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nLockhart served in the Clinton White House during the president\u2019s impeachment in the late 1990s, so he knows the challenges. But then came the Ukraine story, which he said raises a whole new level of concern about the future of the country. \u201cWhen you start doing things that call into question the legitimacy of the next election, you\u2019re in a whole other territory,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking a pro-impeachment position now also may be easier given the trajectory of the issue headed into 2020. \u201cWhether Democrats impeach Trump or not,\u201d Lockhart said, \u201cTrump is providing so much fodder for this that it\u2019s now going to be the story between now and Election Day.\u201d", "description": "Alumni of the Obama and Clinton worlds are joining the pro-impeachment caucus after years of reticence.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c1/18/7293e3514ffa94d01ce28166e5a6/20190923-al-gore-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
