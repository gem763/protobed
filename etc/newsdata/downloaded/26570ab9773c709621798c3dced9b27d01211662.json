But as the climate crisis challenges fashion\u2019s fundamental viability as an industry, the stakes, and tempers, have been raised.\n\nHours before the first catwalk show of the five-day run, the climate campaign group Extinction Rebellion staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d outside the central London venue, throwing buckets of fake blood to symbolise how \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for fashion and other industries is leading toward the extinction of life on earth. The group is calling for the industry to be \u201ccancelled\u201d and is planning continued disruption to fashion week, culminating in a \u201cfuneral procession for fashion\u201d to be staged on Tuesday evening.\n\nSustainability is now widely accepted in the industry to be the metric that matters most \u2013 at least in theory. In practical terms there is a good deal of resistance to the suggestion that clothes production should be phased out completely, but a new generation of designers is approaching fashion with sustainability as a first principle.\n\nOur generation has been very self-centred ... now we have to take some responsibility Roland Mouret\n\nAs a teenager in Liverpool, Patrick McDowell made clothes out of unwanted end-of-line fabrics. \u201cI\u2019ve always done this, so when I heard about sustainability I thought: \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a name for what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d His new collection, Fire Fighting Aunties, inspired by his firefighter father and his mother and aunts who \u201cput out the family fires and rescued us from trouble\u201d, is created from surplus fabric donated by Burberry and crystals by Swarovski and is on display inside the headquarters of London fashion week. The use of quality raw materials means \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like waste, and that\u2019s important\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur generation have been very self-centred,\u201d says the designer Roland Mouret, a 20-year veteran of fashion week, at the catwalk headquarters. \u201cWe are the generation who changed fashion from a model of two collections a year to six collections a year. So now we have to take some responsibility.\u201d\n\nMouret has partnered with Arch & Hook to create clothes hangers made from 100% recycled marine plastic. After use they are 80% recyclable, rather than the standard 25%. \u201cThe volume of clothes hangers that went to landfill last year in the USA could build a structure the size of the Empire State Building,\u201d says Mouret. \u201cI\u2019m prouder of this project than anything else I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the online retailer MyWardrobe is reinventing itself as a rental service for the designer clothes it once sold, and Harvey Nichols is introducing an after-care service for shoes and bags to encourage customers to restore rather than replace last year\u2019s purchases.\n\nScrap the catwalk: Extinction Rebellion is right \u2013 London fashion week is unsustainable Read more\n\nBut, says the Extinction Rebellion activist Sara Arnold, \u201cwhat is happening in fashion so far is not in proportion to the crisis that we are in\u201d.\n\nShe points out that clothes production is still growing and on course for a 63% increase between now and 2030. \u201cWe have actually had warm and productive conversations with the British Fashion Council. But at the moment the industry thinks sustainability can help fashion survive. This is not about the survival of fashion, it\u2019s about the survival of the planet.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which brought severe disruption to central London streets in April, plans two days of \u201cswarming\u201d (described by Arnold as \u201cblocking the road enough to slow the traffic down but keeping it moving enough so that people don\u2019t get angry\u201d) over the weekend.\n\n\u201cLondon fashion week has multiple venues so we can cause disruption to personnel trying to travel between them, and call attention to the fact that none of us can continue with business as usual.\u201d\n\nPlay Video Extinction Rebellion protesters stage 'die-in' outside London fashion week venue \u2013 video\n\nThe shows will be chosen for logistical reasons rather than to target specific designers or brands. \u201cIt\u2019s not about blaming or shaming,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cWe understand that the fashion industry did not create the toxic system we are all in. But it is part of it, and it needs to change.\u201d\n\nA funeral procession will depart from Trafalgar Square at 5pm on Tuesday 17 September to mark the last day of shows.\n\nArnold studied fashion design at Central St Martins before environmental concerns led to a decision not to design or produce new clothes. She has now founded the clothes rental company Higher Rental. \u201cDuring world war two, clothing was rationed and ostentatious dress became frowned upon. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what should happen now, but that drastic level of action is relevant given that this situation is more profound than the second world war.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons fashion is a target for the climate activists is because it shapes people\u2019s aspirations, says Arnold.\n\n\u201cCulture should be leading the way in facing this issue, but instead culture is being used to deceive us that everything is fine. Culture is complicit in our destruction, when it should be taking responsibility for people getting their heads around this existential problem.\n\n\u201cThe fashion industry has a huge voice and it should be using it. When a fire alarm goes off, someone needs to stand up and leave the room, otherwise no one thinks the alarm is real. We need fashion to be that person.\u201d\n\nCaroline Rush, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council, says she does not agree with Arnold that the industry\u2019s sustainability efforts amount to mere tweaking. \u201cI think it\u2019s more than tweaking. In London we are seeing businesses come through which are truly focused on having a much lower impact on the planet, whether that\u2019s by upcycling fabric or through circular business models. We hear the message of Extinction Rebellion. Our role is to make the information digestible for fashion businesses so that they can take practical action.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest British Fashion Council\u2019s CEO Caroline Rush.
