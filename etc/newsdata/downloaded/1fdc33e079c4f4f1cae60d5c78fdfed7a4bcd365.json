No matter what happens we all, Remainers and Brexiters, have to learn to live harmoniously\n\nThe dilemma We\u2019ve had a child since the referendum, and I feel a Brexit-related chasm is opening up between our family\u2019s generations. My husband and I are moderate in our political views and both voted to remain in the EU. My parents and mother-in-law voted to leave. I look at my daughter and feel devastated that her world is potentially going to be smaller than mine, with fewer opportunities to live, love and work as she pleases. Our own parents are dependent upon us for varying levels of care. This has been mildly frustrating in the past, but we both have loving families and a strong sense of duty. We\u2019ve talked about leaving the UK for a more open and inclusive society, but don\u2019t want to leave our parents dependent on paid-for care. Whichever option we explore, we\u2019re increasingly resentful our parents voted for us to be in this position (based on various arguments, some with racist undertones), and that they don\u2019t even recognise the situation. Should we raise it with them? I fear a permanent rift, but brewing resentment doesn\u2019t feel healthy either.\n\nMariella replies Talk about the nation\u2019s debate in a microcosm! It was only a matter of time before this toxic political fracas, currently dividing us like the most bitter of divorces, came to haunt lifestyle pages as well as the headlines. So many families and friendships have been torn asunder by the passion disgorged on both sides, with the only comfort being that it\u2019s a long while since people engaged with politics with such ferocity.\n\nBrexit has unleashed a tsunami of frustration and fear and, as you point out, the generational divide is part of the fracture. What chance do you think you have of changing your parents\u2019 minds? That seems to me to be the crux of this impasse. Those of us holding out for a second referendum do so with scant belief that the voting percentages would change dramatically. What seems to have occurred since that fateful June morning, when our children lost their right to roam among their closest neighbours, is greater entrenchment and growing resentment on both sides.\n\nThe time to start mending fences is now\n\nI\u2019m the first to admit that remain\u2019s argument was lacklustre, out-of-touch and ultimately patronising. Their \u201cbetter together\u201d principle may have been right, but the delivery was badly flawed. It was like a complacent spouse explaining that while they might be dreary, the alternative would be a roller-coaster ride of uncertainty. Clearly, plenty are up for that ride! Far more compelling rationale has flowed from the likes of Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine, whose broader view of history and statesmanlike declarations about co-operation and democracy might have carried the crowd.\n\nOn the opposite side are those who were sold the Brexit dream by a bunch of desperados who make secondhand car salesmen look like paragons of truth and virtue. Those torch bearers are like the serial adulterer \u2013 no matter how many times they are exposed as having deceived us, they plead their commitment and promise tomorrow will be different. The one imperative to have been swept from the table is what kickstarted the debacle in the beginning \u2013 the need for EU reform. Reform not just to ensure member states don\u2019t end up in a bitter battle like ours, but to shape a cumbersome governing body for a fast-moving, globalising world.\n\nI\u2019ve not witnessed political chaos on this level since the early 80s when strike action, union fury and the Iron Lady combined to create a social revolution of seismic strength that in many ways set the scene for the strife today.\n\nWhere does your little family fracas fit in all this? Right in the epicentre, I\u2019d say. No matter what happens we are all, Remainers and Brexiters, going to have to learn to harmoniously co-habit on our small island with understanding, patience, empathy and reduced hyperbole. At the moment, like you, we\u2019re all waiting to see what the outcome will be; but actually, the time to start mending fences is now.\n\nYour parents have made a choice that may or may not influence where you choose to raise your children. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to fall out; just that their choice has had an impact on yours. So, I wouldn\u2019t try to change their minds or convince them they\u2019ve got it wrong. Instead, illustrate to them that many of their fears \u2013 whether of marauding migrants or lack of self-determination \u2013 are unjustified. Be honest, but without acrimony when you explain the decisions you\u2019ve made, bearing in mind their wellbeing and with your child\u2019s future at the forefront of your mind.\n\nThe only non-negotiable in this whole debacle is that we can\u2019t compromise on our determination to carve a better future. In or out, we owe it to ourselves to ensure that we become again a nation we can be proud to inhabit for its values of inclusion, intelligent debate, democracy and basic human and equal rights. That\u2019s plenty to be getting on with.\n\nIf you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.
