The timing of these escalations is also curious given that they seem designed to make the upcoming talks much more difficult than they need to be, and raise the question as to whether the talks are merely window dressing.\n\nWith China yet to retaliate to these recent developments the prospect of any type of deal in the short term is becoming ever more remote, meaning that further tariff escalations are likely to be only a matter of time. As things stand further tariff increases on $250bn of Chinese goods automatically kick in on the 15th October, and this week\u2019s resumption of trade talks don\u2019t look like they will change that.\n\nThis rise in geopolitical tensions has unsurprisingly seen markets in the US and Asia come under pressure, though these nerves don\u2019t appear to have translated into a weaker start for markets in Europe which have opened a little bit firmer.\n\nIn a more positive development Fed chairman Jay Powell announced that the Federal Reserve would soon resume the purchase of short term treasury bonds in the hope that it will stabilise the move in short term rates that has been a hallmark of the last few weeks, and which saw short term funding rates rise sharply.\n\nIn company news GVC Holdings (LON: ), owners of Ladbrokes (LON: ) Coral has seen its shares rise on the open after the company raised its full year guidance to \u00a3670m to \u00a3680m, from the previous \u00a3650m to \u00a3670m, driven by continued growth in its on line business, as net gaming revenue rose 12%. UK retail remains a pressure point due to the cut in maximum stakes in fixed odds betting terminals, which has seen revenues fall 18%, though this was better than expected. The US business has also made an encouraging start.\n\nShares in Just Eat (LON: ) are also higher after Takeaway.com reported Q3 orders rose 87% to 41.6m, with order in Germany particularly strong rising 136%. In July Takeaway.com announced that it was merging with Just Eat to create one of the world\u2019s largest on line delivery businesses.\n\nThe is holding up relatively well despite the rise in the political temperature in the past day or so between London and the rest of the EU. Markets appear to be making the calculation, rightly or wrongly that even if no deal is agreed by the end of the week, or the month, that an extension will happen, and a no deal Brexit avoided, at least in the short term. What happens after that is anybody\u2019s guess, given that most crystal balls as far as Brexit is concerned have proved to be fairly unreliable of late.\n\nWith relations so fraught between all parties it would appear that trust on all sides has broken down, making it all the more likely that the only way to break the impasse is to change the players in parliament in the hope that the arithmetic changes sufficiently to drive a deal through.\n\nFor all the heat being generated in the past couple of days and all the talk of who will be blamed for a breakdown in talks one important fact has been overlooked. Even if the UK government were able to come back with a deal there is no guarantee that MPs would vote for it, and that more than anything is why the current impasse exists. Until that changes there is unlikely to be any way to unlock the logjam.\n\nAs such an election seems the most likely outcome in the event we get the expected extension, and from thereon in, all manner of options come to the fore, from a Johnson win, a Corbyn win or yet another hung parliament.\n\nWith European markets treading water just above their closing levels yesterday, US markets also look set to open slightly firmer.\n\nLevi Strauss (NYSE: ) latest saw a bit of a mixed bag, with a slowdown in the US being offset by decent revenue growth in Europe and Asia markets. Profits fell by 4%, in Q3, however net revenues rose by the same amount, beating expectations by $50m. The slowdown in the US was blamed on a number of one-off factors including problems with the acquisition of a South American distributor.\n\nis expected to open 80 points higher at 26,244\n\nis expected to open 9 points higher at 2,902\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution only provider.
