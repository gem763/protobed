(Danny Lawson/AP)\n\nThirty-five police cadets stood at attention, a perfect made-for-TV backdrop, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson strayed from a police recruitment announcement to trash his political opponents for opposing his Brexit plans and for plotting to keep Britain \u201cincarcerated\u201d in the European Union.\n\nAmerican politicians have long used soldiers and police as props during political speeches. But in Britain, politicians have avoided such staging as inappropriate and tacky \u2014 until the arrival of Johnson, the country\u2019s convention-buster in chief.\n\n\u201cBoris is tearing up the rule book,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst with Eurasia Group.\n\nHis tactics have repeatedly defied tradition and precedent in a society that treasures yesterday as a guide for tomorrow.\n\nBritain famously has no written constitution. Its fundamental guide is not a document but an ethos \u2014 a centuries-long history of laws, legal rulings and traditions combined with a collective national assumption about the way things should be done.\n\nIn his six weeks in office, Johnson has detonated many of those assumptions in his effort to keep his promise to lead Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31.\n\nHe ordered Parliament closed for five weeks. Suspensions themselves are not unusual but typically are not for that long, and not in the middle of pivotal moments in history.\n\nHe ejected 21 lawmakers from his Conservative Party for voting against him. They included some of the party\u2019s most iconic figures and even Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, Nicholas Soames.\n\nHe said \u201cshit\u201d on the floor of Parliament, on national television.\n\nHe called his chief rival, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a \u201cchlorinated chicken\u201d during a Parliament debate, instead of the traditional \u201cright honorable gentleman.\u201d Even more inexplicably, he then hurled another schoolboy taunt at Corbyn, calling him a \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse.\u201d\n\nAfter all that, Johnson has refused to say whether he would comply with a law passed by Parliament to avert an abrupt and chaotic \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d next month, without economic and social safeguards agreed with the E.U. \u201cI would rather die in a ditch\u201d than request another Brexit delay, he said \u2014 setting up an unprecedented standoff.\n\nA cross-party group of lawmakers have lined up a legal team and are prepared to go to court to force Johnson to comply with the law, the BBC reported Saturday.\n\n[Who is Boris Johnson? His life in photos.]\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, 55, has the most establishment background possible: educated at the elite Eton and Oxford. But he has never been conventional or stuffy, and even his scarecrow thatch of blonde hair refuses to conform.\n\nAs a foreign correspondent in Brussels, he made a name for himself with incendiary, and factually dubious, stories about the bumbling and planning of E.U. bureaucrats.\n\nAs mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, he was perhaps best known for getting stuck dangling from a zip line during the Summer Olympics.\n\nAnd when he resigned as Britain\u2019s foreign secretary last year, he undiplomatically called then-Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan a piece of excrement.\n\nJohnson has been considered a shrewd politician, who long aspired to Britain\u2019s top job. But, as some of his un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox tactics begin to backfire, he may not be able to keep the job for long.\n\n\n\nJohnson hosts his first Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday. (AP)\n\nHe does not have a single legislative win in his six weeks at 10 Downing Street. Livid lawmakers, in what little time they had left before the scheduled suspension, delivered him three embarrassing defeats last week: taking control of the legislative agenda, disrupting his Oct. 31 Brexit plan and rejecting his call for a general election on Oct. 15.\n\nJohnson is expected to lose a second call for an election Monday. His opponents say they worry he\u2019d manipulate the calendar to force through a no-deal Brexit. Opposition parties have found new cohesion in standing firm against his demands.\n\n[He defied Boris Johnson. Now the prime minister\u2019s party is gunning for his seat, with Brexit on the line.]\n\nMeanwhile, an open rebellion in Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party has cost him his governing majority, making it practically impossible for him to move even non-Brexit legislation. Conservatives, who were already divided about whether to accept a potentially destabilizing no-deal Brexit, are more deeply split than ever.\n\nJohnson paid a deep personal price for his blunt-instrument tactics on Thursday, when his younger brother Jo Johnson resigned as a Conservative legislator and a government minister, citing \u201cunresolvable tension\u201d \u201cbetween family loyalty and the national interest.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s nightmare week ended with his speech before the West Yorkshire police cadets, where he stumbled and bumbled for a full minute, trying unsuccessfully to recite the police caution \u2014 Britain\u2019s equivalent of the Miranda rights.\n\nAs he spoke, a cadet standing behind him fainted.\n\nMark Burns-Williamson, the West Yorkshire police commissioner, called Johnson\u2019s performance a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d and demanded an apology. He said police had been told Johnson planned to focus solely on public safety spending.\n\n\u201cIt clearly turned into a rant about Brexit, the opposition and a potential general election,\u201d Burns-Williamson told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that police officers should\u2019ve formed the backdrop to a speech of that nature.\u201d\n\nJohnson is part of a wave of populist leaders around the globe who are challenging norms and asking why things can\u2019t be done differently. Leaders in Hungary, Poland, Italy, the Philippines and elsewhere are doing and saying things that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago.\n\n[The new autocrats: Leaders are turning democracy into a tool of oppression]\n\nThe leader of the disrupters is, of course, President Trump, who has shattered every possible kind of presidential norm. While Johnson and Trump are vastly different in many ways, they seem to feed off each other and admire each other\u2019s nonconformist styles.\n\n\u201cBoris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him,\u201d Trump said last week.\n\n\u201cHe has many, many good qualities,\u201d Johnson said about Trump this summer.\n\nJon Tonge, a politics professor at the University of Liverpool, said Johnson\u2019s speech in front of the cadets was \u201cstraight from the Donald Trump playbook, deliberately imported . . . the Trumpization of U.K. politics.\u201d\n\nEmily O\u2019Reilly, the European Union\u2019s ombudsman, said Johnson and Trump have both succeeded through force of personality and an \u201cintuitive sense of what appeals to their base, often to the darker or more anarchic, unconventional side of that base.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump and Johnson speak last month during the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France. (Erin Schaff/AP)\n\nShe noted that in the United States and Britain there has been a \u201csignificant exodus of politicians from the center to what had previously been seen as the extreme.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly said the events of last week \u201csuggest that Johnson may have gone too far in . . . the smashing of parliamentary and party conventions.\u201d\n\n[Three ways Boris Johnson could become Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister]\n\nSeveral legal challenges have been filed against Johnson\u2019s moves. A high court judge in London last week sided with Johnson, ruling that he not acted improperly by ordering Parliament shut for five weeks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a rule bender rather than a rule breaker,\u201d Tonge said.\n\nBritain\u2019s lack of a written constitution leaves the country\u2019s politics particularly vulnerable to someone like Johnson, who may follow the law but chooses not to follow established norms.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t previously in the U.K. faced a leadership that was prepared to ignore conventions and precedents,\u201d said Meg Russell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s putting a great deal of pressure on our traditional constitution,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt could ultimately lead to pressure to nail down these rules more firmly.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohnson accidentally steers a bull into a police officer during a visit to Scotland on Friday. (Andrew Milligan/AP)\n\nRob Ford, a political analyst at the University of Manchester, said Britain has no specific laws governing how to interpret and implement referendums. He called that a \u201ctime bomb.\u201d The 2016 Brexit vote was close, and the political class can\u2019t agree on how to implement its results, he said.\n\nJohnson is bending every rule he can think of to push his interpretation \u2014 that the will of the people was to exit the E.U. no matter the terms. His opponents say voters didn\u2019t agree to a no-deal Brexit with potentially damaging repercussions, including predicted shortages of food and medicine.\n\nFord said the \u201conly referee\u201d in that argument is the public, so another vote seemed likely \u2014 either the general election Johnson wants, or the second referendum some anti-Brexit opponents favor.\n\nMany politics watchers blame Johnson\u2019s unconventional Brexit tactics on his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, who masterminded the successful pro-Brexit campaign in 2016. Some here compare Cummings to Stephen K. Bannon, the controversial former chief strategist to Trump.\n\n[The shadowy strategist behind Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit push]\n\nFormer Conservative prime minister John Major, in remarks widely interpreted to be a swipe at Cummings, warned in a speech in Glasgow on Thursday against \u201cpolitical anarchists\u201d who threatened to \u201cpoison the political atmosphere beyond repair.\u201d\n\nEven if Johnson crashes out of office soon, he has exposed complaints with the way the system was working for many people.\n\n\u201cThere were legitimate grievances; the established class failed to a certain extent,\u201d which gave rise to unconventional leaders in the United States and Britain, said Benjamin Haddad, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Future Europe Initiative. \u201cIf you feel you have been left behind, that the system is not working for you, a more brash, direct rhetoric appeals to many people.\u201d\n\nHaddad said the challenge is to address what was not working: \u201cWe need to reinvent the way we conduct politics, the way we find answers to people\u2019s questions.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeople protest Johnson near the Houses of Parliament in London on Wednesday. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News)\n\nJohnson\u2019s behavior has brought thousands of people into the streets across Britain in recent days. People who support Brexit and those who oppose it joined forces to protest Johnson\u2019s norm-busting.\n\nNigel Nott, 70, a retired civil engineer protesting in London, said Johnson was breaking tradition to achieve his goals, and \u201cto hell with everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe unwritten constitution works when you have respect and trust in people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not work in the present circumstances.\u201d\n\nMary Jordan in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nBoris Johnson visits a farm, steers bull into police officer\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s statements about the state of Brexit negotiations bear little relationship to reality, E.U. officials say\n\nWant to understand Boris Johnson?
