If that happens to an eight-year-old, or a 10-year-old, it just leaves scars that will not go away.\n\n'If, as a child, you have had to overcome abuse and discrimination it makes you stronger. But on the other side it also leaves scars.\n\n'Today, Lewis has a good and mature perspective but the scars are certainly there. That is not the only motivating factor for him - those scars are a witness to having survived. We are not very diverse in Formula One, and I have learned through Lewis to accept that it is difficult to overcome discrimination from time to time.\n\nThe five-time world champion was racially abused on the track when he was a junior karting\n\nHamilton will win his sixth world championship if he outscorers Valtteri Bottas by 14 points\n\nHOW LEWIS HAMILTON CAN CLINCH SIXTH WORLD TITLE - Win and record the fastest lap with Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas finishing lower than third - Win with Bottas lower than fourth - Finish second and record the fastest lap with Bottas lower than seventh - Finish second with Bottas lower than eighth if Bottas sets fastest lap - Finish third and record the fastest lap with Bottas lower than eighth - Finish third with Bottas finishing lower than ninth\n\n'Racism has a subtle side and it is painful. Lewis wears his heart on his sleeve, he has opinions, and by expressing them he will always run the risk of polarising opinion.'\n\nHamilton, 34, has regularly called for more diversity in the sport.\n\nWhen penalised by the stewards in Monaco in 2011, he wondered aloud: 'Is it cos I'm black? That's what Ali G says.'\n\nHamilton's minder, Lloyd, is one of few other black faces regularly seen in the paddock.\n\nOn the track, Hamilton must outscore his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas by 14 points this weekend to wrap up title No 6, which would leave him behind only Michael Schumacher, on seven, in the all-time list.\n\nAlthough Hamilton was fastest in practice on Friday, recent history suggests this is unlikely to happen.\n\nAutodromo Hermanos Rodriguez is not a track that has been kind to Mercedes in recent years.\n\nHamilton has finished fourth and ninth on his last two visits and that would not be enough to put Bottas out of his misery.\n\nIndeed, Hamilton must finish on the podium to have any chance of taking the crown. Otherwise, it goes on to Austin a week on Sunday.\n\nHe came third in the Japanese Grand Prix, finishing behind Sebastian Vettel and winner Bottas\n\nHe is without his race engineer Pete Bonnington, who is missing this grand prix and the next for a medical procedure.\n\nBonnington is known to us for his unruffled radio voice in the heat of battle. Radio duties will be taken over by Marcus Dudley, Hamilton's performance engineer.\n\nHamilton, who arrived in Mexico having stirred up controversy by calling on his 13million Instagram followers to embrace veganism, remains most comfortable in the sanctuary of his cockpit.\n\nHis determination to add more wins and new glories is unflagging even going into his 247th race. 'Punching out these performances weekend in, weekend out is such a hard task,' he acknowledged.\n\n'It doesn't matter if I get it done here as long as I get it done. There are still plenty of points on the table and I've got to deliver.'", "description": "JONATHAN McEVOY IN MEXICO CITY: Hamilton broke down racial barriers as a junior karter en route to the summit of Formula One, but he remains the sport's only black driver.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20199814-0-image-a-29_1572040885314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
