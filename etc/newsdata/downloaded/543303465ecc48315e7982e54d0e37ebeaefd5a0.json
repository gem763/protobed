After linking up with fellow Minnesota based cobbler Julio Sanchez, Shooli was born.\n\nThey began by targeting high-rise buildings in Minneapolis, with a secondary focus on affluent suburbs. But the suburbs created their biggest demand.\n\nIn June 2019, they launched a national mail-in order service. Shooli customers leave shoes needing repairs in blue boxes for pick-up in Minnesota, or receive boxes with prepaid shipping labels. 40% of mail-in orders come from the East Coast.\n\nFlynn's advice for aspiring small business owners is to give your idea your all and be willing to make it work at all costs. She credits her dedication \u2014 citing cold nights of trudging through the snow to market her services \u2014 to her success.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nWhen people think of industry-disrupting startups, it's often a certain Bay Area of California that comes to mind, not the snow-covered landscape of the American Midwest.\n\nJulio Sanchez. Shelby Rognholt\n\nYet the latter is exactly where shoe repair service business Shooli launched just last year. With a team of two fueling it, Shooli has grown from running on a paired-down app that was originally designed for a laundry service to a company sustaining a consistent 30% growth in revenue month after month since May of this year that recently launched a nation-wide mail-in service, extending its reach across the country.\n\nOffering \"shine, care, and repair\" services, Minneapolis-based customers can schedule a pick-up, leaving their shoes in a blue Shooli box to be scooped up and brought to the company's Northeast Minneapolis warehouse for a fixing up. Those outside of the Twin Cities can request a box that comes complete with a prepaid label and shuttle their shoes through the mail instead.\n\nTools at Shooli. Shelby Rognholt\n\nOnce at the warehouse, shoes are repaired by long-time cobbler Julio Sanchez with the help of Meghan Flynn, Shooli's head honcho who has learned to do minor repairs herself. Considering that the number of cobblers across the US has dwindled from roughly 100,000 in the 1930's to somewhere around 5,000 today, Shooli is a modern take on an age-old tradition.\n\nHere's how this tech-centric shoe repair company took hold in the Midwest.\n\nAn old idea turned new\n\nPrior to transitioning to Shooli full time in July of 2018 to concentrate on the company before its October 2018 launch, Flynn was in accounting at Hemisphere Companies, a Twin Cities-based investment firm. It was here that the idea for Shooli was brought up among coworkers.\n\nMeghan Flynn and Julio Sanchez. Shelby Rognholt\n\n\"One of the guys at our group came into the office one day and was like, 'Meghan, do you know where to get shoes shined? Where do you get shoes cleaned?' and I was like, 'I'm a girl. Do girls even get their shoes shined?'\" she recalled to Business Insider.\n\nBut the idea stuck with her. Outside of the airport, there are no convenient shoe care options \u2014 and even at the airport, most travelers are too busy connecting between flights to sit down for a shoeshine anyway.\n\n\"We have everything available on an app, how can we not get shoe care available? That's honestly where it originally came from,\" Flynn said. She turned the idea over in her head, talking to coworkers and hypothesizing about the potential market for such a service. \"It was like, can we make Minnesota work? Because that's where we are. What will it take?\" she explained.\n\nShoes at Shooli. Shelby Rognholt\n\nFlynn pieced together what it would take to turn the idea that would become Shooli into reality \u2014 mapping out the startup costs and timeline and crafting a game plan for finding experienced cobblers to work with \u2014 and pitched it to her company, which gave Shooli the initial funding it needed to get started. With that, Flynn was no longer an accountant, but the chief operating officer of a fledgling startup and an apprentice cobbler.\n\nFlynn hit the ground running approaching local cobblers, and turning up nothing except being occasionally blacklisted as competition, she found her way to Sanchez's shop in St. Bonifacius, MN, 30 miles to the west of Minneapolis. A lifelong cobbler who also had dreams of digitizing shoe repair, Sanchez quickly joined Flynn in her venture. Soon after, the duo moved to the Northeast Minneapolis warehouse that Shooli calls home today.\n\nScaling the business in multiple unexpected markets\n\nShooli's first target markets were high-rise buildings in Minneapolis' downtown and North Loop neighborhoods with the assumption that high-volume locales would constitute the bulk of their business, with a secondary market focus on St. Louis Park and Edina, two relatively affluent Minneapolis suburbs.\n\nShooli. Shelby Rognholt\n\n\"It did not happen like that, however, as life goes,\" Flynn recalled. She discovered that Shooli's highest demand was coming from its secondary markets, particularly Edina, which still makes up a consistent amount of the service's business today.\n\nIt soon became clear that the pick-up and drop-off service that Shooli was originally conceived to be would limit its success, so in June of 2019 the company launched a nationwide mail-in service for shoe repairs. Today, a hefty chunk of business actually comes from the East coast, and the mail-in service constitutes the bulk of Shooli's business, with roughly 40% of Shooli's mail-in orders coming from areas like New York City and Boston. In true startup fashion, Shooli is still testing what works best, but turn-around times remain a week or less.\n\nA shoe at Shooli. Shelby Rognholt\n\nIt's turned out that the dominant demographic of Shooli customers in the local drop-off market were customers in the 50- to 60-year-old age bracket and \"millennials with their Red Wings \u2014 holy cow!\" Flynn said of the leather work boots popular among Midwesterners. \"They've been a huge market for us.\" On the mail-in side, most orders focus on specialty repairs that require sole and heel work.\n\nSanchez enjoys the challenges that these kinds of orders can bring.\n\n\"Some customers are very specific about what they want,\" he told Business Insider, holding up a pair of men's dress shoes that he altered to give the owner a little height boost for her wedding. He was in the process of taking the lift out of the shoes to return them back to their normal state when he remarked that the owner must have enjoyed her wedding, pointing to scuff marks on the top of the shoes.\n\nA shoe at Shooli. Shelby Rognholt\n\nWhen it comes to what it takes to accomplish something like growing a startup in a traditionally unexpected location, Flynn credits her dedication \u2014 citing cold nights of trudging through the snow to market her service at apartment buildings and poorly attended events \u2014 to her success.\n\nThe Shooli logo. Shelby Rognholt\n\n\"How long are you willing to stick with it? How long are you willing to grind and make it work?\" she said. Despite sometimes crying in her car after such an event, so far not giving up has proved worth it for Flynn, considering the double-digit month-after-month growth her company is seeing today. \"We've come full circle within the last year,\" she added.", "description": "Meghan Flynn left her full-time job in accounting to create Shooli, a shoe repair app, with cobbler Julio Sanchez.", "authors": ["Cinnamon Janzer"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db75d73dee01967c42b83f6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
