He had remarried not long before that and settled in Chapel Hill, N.C.\n\nHe did have a will, but did not specify individual items to be given to his relatives. His new wife (AKA my children\u2019s stepmother) is having a massive estate sale at the end of August.\n\nIn the list of items to be sold are many things our children gifted to him for Father\u2019s Day, Christmas, birthdays, etc. Some still bear their inscription to him.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: I\u2019ve taken care of an 85-year-old man for two years \u2014 he attempted suicide and now wants to leave me his home\n\nShe has also listed many items from his younger days that he had promised to his children as well as family heirlooms that should be returned to his family.\n\nDo the grown children have any recourse in obtaining these items prior to the estate sale? The new wife refuses to willingly give his biological children any of the items they\u2019ve asked for.\n\nFormer Wife\n\nDear Former Wife,\n\nWhile many families fight over money when a parent dies, others fight about the strangest things. I\u2019ve had letters from a daughter who fell out with her mother over a sewing machine. Others relationships have come a cropper over antique furniture and jewelry. Your children are only concerned with items of sentimental value. Family heirlooms, ideally, should stay within the family.\n\nIt seems churlish of your children\u2019s stepmother to hold onto these belongings. She may feel like she was not given the right amount of respect as their father\u2019s wife. Or their personalities might have clashed. Or she might just want to do things her way because \u2014 after the death of her husband \u2014 it\u2019s the last thing she has control over. It\u2019s better not to wander around that haunted house.\n\nAlso see: I want to renegotiate my divorce settlement\u2014 I pay my wife $3,000 a month, but she still hasn\u2019t gotten a steady job\n\nThis is a cautionary tale not to rely on the kindness of relatives. People do all sorts of regrettable things when they\u2019re grieving. They lash out. I know of at least one sordid tale where a stepmother \u2014 a public figure \u2014 refused to allow her stepson to speak at his father\u2019s funeral. His son sat quietly and respectfully in the pews and, when the moment was right, he made his move. He spoke, anyway.\n\nRecommended: I have driven 2 hours to visit my elderly parents twice a week for 10 years \u2014 shouldn\u2019t I receive compensation?\n\nIf your former husband left his wife everything in his will, your kids are out of luck. If there was no will, they may have some leverage as the state\u2019s laws take precedence. Gifts, inheritance and assets brought into the marriage are separate property. In some states, the spouse receives one-half of that if there is one child or one-third of the separate property if there is more than one child.\n\nFailing that, your children could attend the estate sale, or have a friends attend for them and bid over the phone. It may be an undignified way to retrieve these items, but it would be a great story to tell their children. In fact, bring as many friends as you can, use GoFundMe to raise funds and tell the story of your children\u2019s father and their gifts, and their churlish stepmother. Buy, buy, buy.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? Send them to MarketWatch\u2019s Moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nWould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new Moneyist column has been published?
