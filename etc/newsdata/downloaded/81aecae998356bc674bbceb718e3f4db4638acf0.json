But Spain\u2019s problems deepened when the Manchester United goalkeeper, who had made a stunning save to deny Robin Quaison in the first half, limped off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.\n\nThey looked on course for a first defeat of the qualifying campaign until Rodrigo fired through a crowded penalty area to clinch the draw.\n\nSweden were left grateful to Alexander S\u00f8rloth, who scored a late equaliser for Norway in Romania. The 1-1 draw means Romania stay a point behind the Swedes in third, while the Faroe Islands beat fellow Group F also-rans Malta 1-0.\n\nItaly, already assured of qualification, took the lead in after just two minutes in Liechtenstein through Federico Bernardeschi. But they had to wait until the 70th minute to find the net again through Andrea Belotti\u2019s header before Alessio Romagnoli, Stephan El Shaarawy and Belotti again wrapped up a 5-0 win.\n\nThe Norwich striker Teemu Pukki scored twice for Finland in a comfortable 3-0 victory over Armenia. He struck in the second half after Fredrik Jensen opened the scoring for the hosts, who are second behind Italy in Group J.\n\nA late own-goal by Adnan Kovacevic dented Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s chances of catching Finland as they went down 2-1 in Greece.", "description": "The Manchester United keeper suffered a leg injury in the second half before Rodrigo scored a late equaliser against Sweden to seal Spain\u2019s spot at Euro 2020", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7124e83e392d31fa32d5968d83461cb15a78e1ac/0_388_4114_2469/master/4114.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=489dd6238845f88e15155dca40c0d72c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
