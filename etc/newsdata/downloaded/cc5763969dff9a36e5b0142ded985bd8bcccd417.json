Mueller III.\n\n\u201cI had one call from Roger, as I recall it \u2014 Roger disputes this \u2014 on the day that WikiLeaks did begin in October dropping the final emails on John Podesta, in which Roger was essentially saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this timing issue because the Billy Bush tape is going to be released, and we\u2019d like to have Assange begin releasing emails now,\u2019\u201d Corsi told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber on Monday. Bush was the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d anchor who appeared with Trump in the clip from 2005, in which the host of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d describes using his stardom to grope and kiss women.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStone was indicted Friday, accused by the special counsel of lying to Congress about his quest for information about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to release information damaging to the Democratic candidate. According to the indictment, Stone was assigned this quest by \u201csenior Trump Campaign officials.\u201d And he allegedly enlisted two friends and intermediaries in the effort, including Corsi, identified in the indictment as \u201cPerson 1.\u201d\n\nWhether Stone had a hand in the advantageous timing, by influencing the dissemination of the purloined emails, could help investigators answer the question of why he, and others in Trump\u2019s orbit, allegedly lied in responding to congressional queries about possible collusion between the Republican campaign and Russian officials who interfered in the race. When asked by Melber why Stone lied, Corsi said, \u201cI failed to take the mind-reading course at Harvard. You\u2019ll have to ask Roger.\u201d\n\nStone has repeatedly denied conspiring with WikiLeaks, asking Friday on CNN, \u201cWhere is the WikiLeaks collaboration?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCorsi acknowledged that he could not \u201cprove\u201d that the longtime Republican operative and self-described \u201cdirty trickster\u201d had taken steps to influence the timing of the email dump. Instead, he merely shared his recollection of their phone conversation, which he also recounts in his book, \u201cSilent No More: How I Became a Political Prisoner of Mueller\u2019s \u2018Witch Hunt.\u2019\u201d In the 192-page book, Corsi writes that Stone asked him to see if he \u201ccould get Assange to begin dropping the Podesta emails on top of the Washington Post expos\u00e9.\u201d\n\nCorsi said that he did not have a good mechanism for doing so, but that he made some halfhearted attempts, including issuing \u201csome tweets.\u201d\n\nResponding to the book\u2019s claims in November, Stone told the Daily Caller that the allegations were \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Instagram this month, he labeled Corsi a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d also identifying him as \u201cJudas,\u201d a disciple of Jesus who, in the telling of the Gospels, betrayed him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA best-selling author who boasts a PhD in political science from Harvard, Corsi is a prolific conspiracy theorist. On his YouTube channel, in appearances on Fox News Channel and in his many published books, he has peddled hateful falsehoods, doubting the veracity of official accounts of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and denying that President Barack Obama was born in the United States.\n\nDespite his well-documented tendency to take liberties with the truth, Corsi does have demonstrable links to figures in Trump\u2019s inner circle, including to Stone. Moreover, he had an audience with the special counsel. Corsi\u2019s stepson, Andrew Stettner, also received a subpoena to testify, and the action was seen as a sign that Mueller is keenly focused on the right-wing gadfly, whose causes \u2014 from the \u201cbirther\u201d movement to conspiracies about the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 are also Trump\u2019s.\n\nCorsi said he gave 40 hours of testimony to Mueller\u2019s team and on Sunday told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that he would be \u201chappy to testify\u201d against Stone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI will affirm that what is in the indictment about me is accurate,\u201d Corsi said. There is at least one piece of evidence, however, that he maintains is inaccurate \u2014 one that he wrote. He has disclaimed any direct ties to WikiLeaks, contradicting an August 2016 email cited in the indictment in which he appeared to alert Stone to Assange\u2019s plans for \u201c2 more dumps,\u201d which promised to be \u201cvery damaging.\u201d\n\nCorsi told MSNBC that Mueller \u201cwas convinced\u201d of his link to Assange, who is residing under asylum at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London. After 20 hours spent detailing all possible contacts tying him to the WikiLeaks founder, Corsi claimed, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find anyone. I certainly couldn\u2019t find anyone.\u201d\n\nHe said that he had told Mueller\u2019s team about his recollections of the phone call concerning the timing of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked whether the special counsel was interested, Corsi said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet the day before the WikiLeaks dump, Stone previewed the coming threat to Clinton\u2019s campaign. His Twitter account has since been suspended.\n\n\"Julian Assange will deliver a devastating expose on Hillary at a time of his choosing,\u201d he wrote on Oct. 6, 2016. \u201cI stand by my prediction. #handcuffs4hillary\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday, Stone accused prosecutors of \u201ctrying to criminalize legitimate political inquiry.\u201d He noted that he had not been charged with conspiracy, observing, \u201cIf they could have made that case, they would have.\u201d\n\nHe also predicted that Mueller would conclude by accusing both the president and the vice president of collusion. \u201cThat way they can make Nancy Pelosi president. She can make Hillary Clinton vice president.\u201d He called this scenario a \u201cnightmare.\u201d\n\nStone also vowed not to turn on the president.\n\n\u201cI am not going to testify against him because I possess no negative information,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no Russian collusion. This is a witch hunt.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Jerome Corsi said he has told the special counsel about a conversation with Stone in which the Trump confidant, who was indicted on Friday, expressed his desire for the release of emails damaging to Hillary Clinton to coincide with the publication of the videotape showing Trump bragging about sexual assault.", "authors": ["Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xemK8RslZfgd4eog8KeNICYJe1s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RPE4OMRDIMI6TNNUDUMN7N5QQQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-29"}
