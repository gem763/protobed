She's a keen Amazon shopper and her social media alliephunter is filled with great fashion inspiration for every occasion. Here she looks gorgeous as she poses in New South Wales, Australia, in a high waist polka dot skirt she scored for just $13 and a long sleeve turtleneck. She's also rocking a pair of white Venus Celina sneakers and silk pearl headband that comes in a multi-pack. This entire outfit was bought on Amazon and we think she looks great!\n\nHouston mom and style blogger Carmen Renee looks gorgeous in these her Amazon MVE over the knee camel boots starting at just $19.98. The beauty lover added another tan touch to this simple look with a belt buckle fedora hat that is currently just $16.45 on Amazon.
