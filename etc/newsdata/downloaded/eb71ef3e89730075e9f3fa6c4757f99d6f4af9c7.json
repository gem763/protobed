With them they bring a dowry of livestock - in this case 20 goats, three camels and 10 cows, given over a period of several weeks. The final 10 cows are handed over on the morning the girl is taken to her new home by her husband.\n\nBefore they can get married the girls must go through a rite of passage to mark their coming of age. They are kept out of the sight of the men in the community for a month, then for about a week before the ceremony, the girls wait in an isolated hut, dressed in colourful beaded headdresses and animal skin.\n\nOver 100 girls took part in the rite, which begins in the evening and lasts through the following day. The girls walk in a line one after the other, and are required to stand and sing through the night. Once the ceremony comes to a close, the girls are ready to be wed.", "description": "A young Pokot girl is held by a member of her community as she tries to escape a forced marriage, unaware of the arrangements her father had made.", "authors": ["Siegfried Modola"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQxIY9ndKm0dHdtQr-7GAOl43o61xFph7gvyBhdQkhDDnLTt--N96tAkVfybR0dN08HwiQwPKdU5n5SJJfkpvNt13e5s4vWPeGXIn2uAxdX78", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
