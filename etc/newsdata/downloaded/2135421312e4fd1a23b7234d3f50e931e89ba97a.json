The Trump administration has refused to give Congress a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the call, in which Trump reportedly pressured Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations about Biden.\n\nTrump told reporters on Sunday he had a great call with Zelensky and that he would have no problem with his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, testifying before Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt Biden, but he did a very dishonest thing,\" Trump said Sunday morning as he left Washington for a rally in Houston.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said that Biden should be investigated if evidence shows he improperly intervened to protect his son from an investigation in Ukraine.\n\n\"I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt. I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,\" he said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Congress needs to hear from the whistleblower. If the allegations are sustained, there would be an \"open-and-shut\" case for impeachment, he said.\n\nImpeachment proceedings in Congress can lead to a president being removed from office, but Democrats would need support from Trump's fellow Republicans who control the Senate.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance of us persuading Senate Republicans in an impeachment trial,\" Schiff said. \"They have shown their willingness to carry the president\u2019s baggage, no matter how soiled its contents.\" Before Congressional Democrats move for impeachment, they need to \"persuade the public that this is the right thing to do,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and other news outlets on Friday said Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden, while vice president, threatened to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden\u2019s son was involved was fired.\n\nTrump, reports said, urged Zelensky, a comedian who had just won election, to speak with his personal lawyer, Giuliani, who has promoted the allegations against Biden and his son and acknowledged that he pressed for a Ukrainian investigation.", "description": "Impeachment may be 'only remedy' for Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, Schiff says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8L0IQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
