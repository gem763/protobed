Ironically the only real surprise is how little of a surprise his latest moves are.\n\nFirst was the warning a few days ago that \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 Israeli-Arab voters \u2013 were trying to steal next week\u2019s election, while he has been thwarted by the left and media in his plan to stop it (blocking the naked voter-suppression tactic of putting cameras in polling stations).\n\nNext up was the promise on Tuesday that if he won again, Israel would annex the Jordan valley and the northern Dead Sea, while suggesting more annexation might be on the cards in the occupied West Bank when Donald Trump finally unveils his \u201cpeace plan\u201d.\n\nIf it sounds familiar, it is because Israeli voters, Palestinians \u2013 and the world at large \u2013 have seen this show before.\n\nIn 2015 Netanyahu made a similar play, goading supporters with his infamous claim that \u201cArab voters are coming out in droves\u201d while insisting that Israel would build anywhere it chose inside Jerusalem and never withdraw from the occupied territories. Then Netanyahu was speaking then Barack Obama was in the White House, a president with whom he did not see eye to eye.\n\nIf the language is harsher and bolder this time round \u2013 in the second election in six months in Israel \u2013 it is because it is far from certain that Trump would resist any moves towards annexation, after he controversially moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognised Israel\u2019s claim over the Golan Heights.\n\nWhat once was talk now seems very possible with Trump\u2019s backing.\n\nAnd while Israel has long insisted it needs to remain in the Jordan valley to maintain a \u201csecurity buffer\u201d beside the Jordan River, it is perhaps significant that it is this area he has said he would annex first rather than Jewish settlements in other parts of the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nIt was a threat that Netanyahu has reiterated in recent months, most recently at the end of August, when he said during a speech in the West Bank settlement of Elkana that he planned to extend \u201cJewish sovereignty to all the settlements as part of the [biblical] land of Israel, as part of the state of Israel\u201d.\n\nSo how to interpret Netanyahu\u2019s latest statement? Perhaps by what he did not say out loud.\n\nWhat is clear is that he believes the possibility of such a move may be shrinking \u2013 \u201ca historic opportunity that we may not have again\u201d \u2013 if Trump does not win re-election.\n\nThat phrasing also suggests that \u2013 for all the bluster \u2013 Netanyahu is not entirely certain that annexation of all the settlements will necessarily be accepted by the Trump White House, even if and when the Trump peace plan is finally published, allegedly a day after next week\u2019s election.\n\nThe reality too is that, Washington\u2019s possible support notwithstanding, any move to annex any of the occupied territories is certain to be sharply rejected by the vast majority of the international community and would critically undermine Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to rally support for his hardline strategy against Tehran.\n\nSo while it is grabbing the headlines, it remains a half-promise by an anxious politician under criminal investigation, and one that is contingent on US support.\n\nBut above all it is a simple and naked electoral gambit by a populist leader who has schooled the world repeatedly in the viability of such crude electoral stunts.\n\nWhat is certain, as the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, quickly responded, is that any annexation \u2013 partial or otherwise \u2013 of occupied Palestinian land would destroy the last pretence of any remnant of a peace process \u2013 with Netanyahu as its \u201cprime destroyer\u201d.", "description": "Israeli PM is a master of fiery rhetoric but Trump\u2019s support could embolden him to action", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81d7500492f4f29fbd6248ab011f44b14122109/123_329_5572_3343/master/5572.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2342c37a280dad6f7862e150f90a0c22", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
