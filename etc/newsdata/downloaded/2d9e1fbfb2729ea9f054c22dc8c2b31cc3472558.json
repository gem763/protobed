His staff connected with Major League Baseball, which then coordinated with the Nationals. Trump is expected to sit with MLB officials.\n\nPresidential visits are part of D.C. baseball tradition: Every president who has been in office while a major league team has played in Washington has not only attended a game but also thrown out a ceremonial first pitch during his visit. Trump will attend his first Nationals game as president Sunday, but he will not throw out the first pitch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRestaurateur and humanitarian Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who has been openly critical of many Trump policies, will instead throw out the first pitch. The two also have a legal history: Trump sued Andr\u00e9s for breach of contract in 2015 after Andr\u00e9s, upset by Trump\u2019s tirades against Mexican immigrants during his campaign, pulled out of a deal to open a restaurant in Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel. Andr\u00e9s later countersued him, and the two sides settled two years later. When Trump disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles from their traditional post-Super Bowl visit in 2018, Andr\u00e9s invited them to his restaurant instead.\n\nIn planning first pitches, MLB and teams typically work together. The team will submit its list of choices, and MLB either okays them or nixes those suggestions and provides alternatives. In the case of a presidential visit, MLB would have given preference to Trump throwing out a first pitch had he wanted to do so. On Thursday, Trump jokingly told reporters that throwing out a first pitch would be undesirable because he\u2019d have to wear protective \u201carmor\u201d and it would make him look \u201cheavy.\u201d\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Nationals principal owner Mark Lerner told The Washington Post that all three first pitches \u2014 2005 National Chad Cordero, a member of the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy and Andr\u00e9s \u2014 had been the Nationals\u2019 choices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe first pitches are our call, and we felt there are many other candidates that should be considered before [Trump],\u201d Lerner said. \u201c. . . We just wanted to have the right people. I think we got a nice mix of people.\u201d\n\nThe league confirmed Saturday that all conversations with Trump about throwing out a first pitch had been directly with MLB on Friday. Commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters that MLB asked the President whether he wanted to throw out the first pitch, but he declined. Trump does not plan to arrive in time to see that first pitch; he is planning to arrive after the game begins. Manfred said Trump made that decision to alleviate the crush of fans entering the ballpark with higher security constraints.\n\n\u201cHis view was that to make the fan experience as positive as possible, he would arrive at Game 5 sometime after the game began so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with fans getting into the stadium,\u201d Manfred told reporters. \u201cQuite frankly, we were very grateful for that. We thought it was a great decision on the president\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nManfred has been in touch with Trump directly. On Saturday afternoon, he played golf with Trump and Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) at Trump National Golf Club, the White House confirmed. The commissioner and the president have interacted before. In January 2017, shortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Manfred met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York. Manfred told Fox Business at the time that it was a \u201creally nice meeting\u201d at which Trump explained his longtime baseball fandom. They will both be in attendance Sunday, among many dignitaries reportedly planning to attend.\n\nThe Nationals are accustomed to high-profile visitors. They regularly host Supreme Court justices, members of Congress and other dignitaries with little fuss. But a visit from the president requires far more planning, so the past few days have included coordination among the Nationals, league officials and the White House advance staff to plan for the president\u2019s visit. They have already announced that they will open the gates at 4 p.m., an hour earlier than usual, for a first pitch scheduled for a little after 8.\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The president will arrive after the game begins to alleviate the crush of spectators at Nationals Park.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign", "Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bx3xzTGR7nLyLXvmR6_A6sKf_hs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QYS6KVXYCEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
