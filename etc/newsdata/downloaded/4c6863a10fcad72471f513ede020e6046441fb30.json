We want to make sure we don\u2019t leave equipment behind. So I\u2019m not prepared to put a timeline on it, but that\u2019s our general gameplan,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump on Saturday said it was \u201cvery smart\u201d not to be involved in the conflict in Syria, adding that he was working with Sen. Lindsey Grham, R-S.C., and other members of Congress about imposing sanctions on Turkey.\n\n\u201cTreasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nSome U.S. troops withdrew from the Syrian town of Ain Issa on Sunday as the Kurdish administration in Syria said that 785 people affiliated with the Islamic State escaped from a camp holding about 12,000 displaced people amid the conflict.\n\nAin Issa has served as headquarters for the Kurdish administration and is positioned beside the M4 highway, which is used to transport aid to parts of northeastern Syria.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday said that the military operation in Syria would continue until the Kurdish forces are driven away from Turkey\u2019s borders.", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered all of the country\u2019s troops to withdraw from Syria amid conflicts between Turkey and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
