Beginning in the late 1960s, the election of first black mayors in Cleveland, Ohio, Newark, New Jersey, Detroit, Michigan, Gary, Indiana, and Los Angeles manifested black power, said Derryn Eroll Moten, chairman of Alabama State University's Department of History and Political Science.\n\nThe city being led by a black mayor is an achievement pushed forward by defining moments during the civil rights movement. The outcome of Tuesday\u2019selection is a product of the key figures who fought for civil rights from Alabama's capital like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, E.D. Nixon and Johnnie Carr.\n\n\"Civil rights leaders promised that an unencumbered black vote would bring real changes in American society,\" Moten said.\n\nMoten said the election of Montgomery's first black mayor wouldn't be possible without groups that pushed for African-American participation in local and state politics \u2013 the Women's Political Council, the Dallas County Voters League, Rufus Lewis' Citizens Club and the Alabama Democratic Conference.\n\nChanges materialized in the South in the wake of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, with the election of Sheriff Lucius Amerson in Alabama and the election of Julian Bond to the Georgia House of Representatives. Both were elected in 1966 and became the first African Americans to hold these offices since Reconstruction.\n\nMontgomery mayor: What you need to know about the runoff election\n\nSome say it's a paradox that Montgomery is both the birthplace of the civil rights movement and the cradle of the Confederacy. Others say it shows the resilience of African Americans that a city with a history of slavery, lynchings, white supremacy and Jim Crow laws elected its first black mayor Tuesday.\n\nMontgomery is going through a noticeable transformation. Last year, the Equal Justice Initiative opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice and the Legacy Museum in downtown Montgomery to honor victims of lynching. The memorial is adjacent to the slave market site in Montgomery. It has brought several hundred thousand visitors here, many who wouldn't have visited the Deep South otherwise.\n\nThere are outside investors building downtown hotels for those visitors, and a new whitewater park and outdoor center is planned near downtown. The multimillion-dollar investment is in a near west side neighborhood inhabited predominantly by black families. It's one of the poorest areas, in need of development but often overlooked.\n\nBefore the election results were announced, Bailey predicted the voters would show Montgomery's progress since those days of racial terror. Reed\u2019s election is the latest example of the city reconciling its past and planning for a better future.\n\nNow, it's the future that Reed must lead the city into.\n\nMayoral candidate Steven Reed shakes hands with family and supporters at his campaign headquarters in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2019.

Mayor Todd Strange did not seek re-election.\n\nReed said he wants to invest in public transportation and address the issue of brown water and food deserts in some of Montgomery's communities. He talked about elevating the economy by being more receptive and supportive of young talent and making the off pace city more competitive. He mentioned working with real estate developers so artists can receive discounted rent for work spaces.\n\nHe said he was open to an ad valorem tax that would increase the millage rate for public education funds. He's repeatedly mentioned a full day, universal pre-K program. The program would guarantee children a spot regardless of their family's income as early childhood education can be expensive for low-income families.\n\nReed will be charged with overseeing the city's $260 million budget that was adopted Sept. 17. He'll deal with continued pressure on the internal service fund used to pay employee medical, dental and retirement benefits. Another issue he will take on is finding funds for salary increases for public safety employees to recruit, retain and address the issue of crime in the city.\n\nFollow Sara MacNeil on Twitter: @sara_macneil\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/montgomery-elects-steven-reed-its-first-african-american-mayor/3915021002/", "description": "Steven Reed, the Montgomery County probate judge, beat TV station owner David Woods and will be sworn into office Nov. 12 at Montgomery City Hall.", "authors": ["Sara Macneil", "Published P.M.
