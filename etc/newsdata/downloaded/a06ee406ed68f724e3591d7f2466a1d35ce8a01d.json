His hometown has been flooded by pills \u2014 \u201ca tsunami,\u201d he says. A thousand people have died of drug overdoses here in less than two decades.\n\nSo Farrell, 47, made a federal case out of the catastrophe. He\u2019s now one of three lead attorneys in the national prescription opioid litigation, the biggest and most complicated civil case in U.S. history.\n\nAD\n\nThe first courtroom showdown is set to begin next week in federal court in Cleveland. Farrell won\u2019t argue the case before the jury. Instead, he\u2019s one of the backstage masterminds of the litigation, which now includes more than 2,600 communities. The plaintiffs argue that the nation\u2019s biggest drug companies \u2014 manufacturers, distributors and retailers \u2014 recklessly peddled opioid painkillers and fueled a wave of addiction.\n\nAD\n\nThe public nuisance strategy he helped craft has the advantage of requiring abatement \u2014 meaning the drug companies could be required to pour billions of dollars into communities across the nation that have been devastated by the epidemic.\n\n\u201cThey broke it. So they need to fix it,\u201d Farrell said of the drug companies. \u201cI want them to stop killing people. I want mothers to stop giving birth to babies addicted to opium. I want my friends and my friends\u2019 children to stop overdosing. I want to stop going to funerals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFarrell is built like a wrestler, and his head has a severe boot-camp buzz cut, which, combined with his blunt speech, adds extra punch to comments like \u201cI am on the war front\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to crucify the chain store dispensers.\u201d\n\nFarrell represents hundreds of municipalities, having aggressively signed up clients, including Cabell County, of which Huntington is the county seat. He and the other plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are working on a contingency fee basis, meaning they don\u2019t get paid anything if they lose in court.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s been financially hard, Farrell said, and he\u2019s not sure exactly how he and his fellow litigators would ultimately be paid -- because there\u2019s never been a case quite like this. But in discussing the case, he tends to talk about his hometown. For him, this big lawsuit is personal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat you see is the shell of the former glory and beauty of the town I grew up with,\u201d Farrell said.\n\nA city's resilience\n\nHuntington is intimately acquainted with tragedy. The mayor, Steve Williams, keeps a framed photograph on the wall of his office, directly behind his desk so that anyone speaking to him will see it. It\u2019s the 1970 Marshall University football team.\n\nOn Nov. 14 of that year, a chartered DC-9 airplane carrying the team home from an away game crashed into a hillside nearly a mile short of the Huntington airport runway. The pilots had misjudged their altitude, possibly due to instrumentation malfunction. All 75 people aboard \u2014 including players, coaches and many prominent citizens who were boosters of the local team \u2014 perished.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat remains the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. sports history. It also remains very much on the minds of the citizens of Huntington. In interviews, public officials often cite the crash when speaking about the city\u2019s resilience. They say they had to learn to hold up one another in hard times.\n\nOpioid pills became popular in the late 1990s, after the medical community embraced pain as the \u201cfifth vital sign\u201d and Purdue Pharma introduced its powerful, slow-release painkiller OxyContin, which the company marketed as less likely to be addictive or abused. People became addicted, and pills became street drugs. When the authorities cracked down, heroin came to town. Then came illicit fentanyl, which was cheaper, more powerful and even deadlier than heroin.\n\nFatal overdoses jumped dramatically starting early in this decade. At the peak year of the epidemic, in 2017, Cabell County \u2014 population 96,000 \u2014 experienced 203 fatal drug overdoses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLocal leaders are sensitive to Huntington\u2019s image. They point to progress in the past two years: Deaths are down, overdoses are down. A \u201charm reduction program\u201d based out of the health department distributes clean needles for intravenous drug users, along with naloxone to combat overdoses. The community has opened a walk-in clinic for people actively using drugs and seeking help. A new program offers residential treatment for women with children or who are pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer the epicenter of the epidemic. We are the city of solutions,\u201d says Lyn O\u2019Connell, who helps run a new division of addiction sciences at the Marshall University School of Medicine.\n\nFarrell and his allies in the big lawsuit envision the drug companies funneling money to places like Huntington over many decades to deal with addiction and recovery.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Huntington police chief, Hank Dial, noted that violent crime has dropped 26 percent in the past year, and drug use is down. But there\u2019s a grim reason for that: So many drug users are dead now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hanging up a Mission Accomplished banner yet because we\u2019re still at war here,\u201d Dial said.\n\n'I choose to fight back'\n\nPaul Farrell Sr. is a county circuit court judge here. He says of his son, \u201cHe\u2019s playing in the big leagues now.\u201d Asked to describe his namesake, the judge says, \u201cAggressive. Smart. Focused. And the last two years of his life, this\u201d \u2014 the opioids litigation \u2014 \u201chas been all-consuming.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of Farrells here in Huntington. There\u2019s a Farrell Building downtown. Back in the 1990s and early 2000s the building was the headquarters of Farrell, Farrell & Farrell, a law firm run by Paul Sr., who had not yet been appointed to the bench, and his brothers Mike and Joe. Paul Jr., a graduate of Notre Dame and West Virginia University School of Law, decided to strike out on his own rather than be part of the family firm, because, he says, \u201cA whole bunch of Farrells had to die before I could be in charge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPaul Jr. is not without ambition. He even ran for president of the United States \u2014 sort of. In 2016, he paid $2,500 to have his name on the ballot for the Democratic primary in West Virginia. He said he couldn\u2019t support either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because of their position on coal.\n\n\u201cYou cannot shut down our coal mines, brag about it on the campaign trail and then expect me to vote for you,\u201d Farrell wrote in an op-ed explaining his quixotic candidacy. \u201cWin or lose, I choose to fight back.\u201d He got a respectable number of votes in coal country and boasts that he came close to the number that would have given him three delegates to the national convention.\n\nNow he\u2019s taken on something even more challenging than a presidential race. Among the uncertainties in recent weeks has been who, exactly, will wind up in court if and when the trial begins. Judge Polster has urged the parties to reach a settlement. Purdue Pharma has reached a tentative settlement with the federal court plaintiffs as well as a group of state attorneys general. Johnson & Johnson recently settled with the two Ohio counties that are part of the first bellwether case. The pharmacy companies were excluded from this trial track. Left standing are major drug distributors, including McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmeriSource Bergen.\n\nA second bellwether trial is planned, with Huntington and Cabell County as the plaintiffs. That\u2019s Farrell\u2019s trial, in a sense, because it\u2019ll be on his home turf \u2014 in the federal courthouse, a short walk from the Farrell Building and from the county courthouse where Judge Farrell has his chambers.\n\nFarrell vows to make that second trial more down-to-earth than the first one. The first one will feature a lot of academic experts, he said. But when the trial comes to Huntington, he wants to call to the stand a string of doctors, nurses, police officers, paramedics, firefighters and other first responders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt might never happen, though. The companies could settle.\n\nThere have been other attempts to derail the Cleveland trial. The attorney general of Ohio, Dave Yost, petitioned a federal appeals court to halt the trial, arguing that the states, not the municipalities, should have jurisdiction over the lawsuits and any subsequent distribution of money.\n\nYost\u2019s last-minute effort infuriated Farrell, who along with other attorneys has spent a couple of years amassing evidence and preparing for trial.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t call me off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis entire thing is no longer about the responsibility of the defendants, or even about the amount of money they\u2019re going to pay. The fight right now is who gets to control the money.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the appeals court ruled against Yost, and the Cleveland trial is a go.\n\nThe trial is near\n\nJudge Farrell \u2014 who still makes pancakes for his three sons every Sunday morning \u2014 said that 90 percent of the criminal cases he sees are related to drugs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDo you want your drugs, or the kids?\u201d he recalls asking mothers who are in his courtroom. And sometimes, he said, the answer is \u201cI want the drugs.\u201d\n\nThe fire chief, Jan Rader, who gained renown in the documentary \u201cHeroin(e),\u201d was also in the judge\u2019s office, along with Paul Jr. She described the compassion fatigue that has taken a toll on her first responders. They\u2019ve all gotten good at using naloxone to revive people who have overdosed. But they become jaded when they see the same people overdosing repeatedly.\n\n\u201cA firefighter is a hero. They\u2019re trained to make a situation better. They have the tools to put out a fire. They have the tools and the knowledge to cut somebody out of a car,\u201d Rader said. \u201cThey do not have the tools and knowledge to save somebody long-term who is suffering from substance use disorder.\u201d\n\nPaul Jr. told the story of a young woman who as a girl played sports with his kids. She\u2019d been on and off the drugs. Her grandfather called Farrell and said she was acting erratically again. Farrell called her and asked if she was using and she admitted it. \u201cWhen you\u2019re chasing the dragon as high as you go, the fall is just as great,\u201d he warned her.\n\nThe judge signed an order to have her committed, and she went to residential rehab, and the day she got out, a Sunday, she had dinner with her whole family.\n\n\u201cThe next morning Grandpa found her dead in the bathroom with a needle in her arm,\u201d Paul Jr. said.\n\nOn a recent night, he took a walk downtown. To Farrell\u2019s eyes many of the people on the streets had signs of addiction. It\u2019s nothing he could submit into evidence in a court of law, but it\u2019s obvious from the way people wander aimlessly, or squat on the sidewalk, or pace anxiously.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. Something\u2019s wrong here,\u201d Farrell said.\n\nAs he stood on a streetcorner, along came a skeletal man in ragged clothes. The lawyer decided to engage him.\n\n\u201cWhere you from? What brings you to town?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe thin man said he was from Detroit, here to see some friends. His voice was not much more than a croak. \u201cGonna get my band back together,\u201d the man said \u2014 and that same man would still be wandering downtown aimlessly the next day, alone, no band in sight.\n\nWhen Farrell went back to his darkened office, long after his law firm colleagues had gone home, he made a vow: \u201cI\u2019m going to fix what you just saw.\u201d", "description": "Paul Farrell vows to make the opioid pill industry pay for what happened to Huntington.", "authors": ["Joel Achenbach", "Reporter Covering Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AZT60G8XkuItsLXVZrGUq1cEYFw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/74CMGGXDUQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
