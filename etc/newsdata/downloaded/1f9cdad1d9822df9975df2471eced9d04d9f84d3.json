Xi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all,\u201d the statement added, a reference to banned memes comparing Chinese President Xi Jinping with AA Milne\u2019s portly bear.\n\n\u201cLong live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\u201d the statement read.\n\nOn Tuesday, searches for \u201cSouth Park\u201d on China\u2019s Twitter-like social media platform Weibo and popular film review site Douban did not return any results.\n\nAnd while information on South Park was still available on a few video streaming sites, episodes could not be played.\n\nParker and Stone\u2019s response to China stands in stark contrast to that of major Western brands who have quickly beaten a retreat when faced with potential losses in China\u2019s huge \u2014 and fiercely nationalistic \u2014 consumer market.\n\nCompanies ranging from airlines to fashion houses have issued fulsome apologies, often after being charged with \u201churting the feelings of the Chinese people\u201d.\n\nAs well as any indication of support for protests in Hong Kong, common crimes include labelling Taiwan as a separate country \u2014 China believes it is a renegade province \u2014 or discussing Xinjiang, where rights groups say a million mostly-Muslim minorities are being held in prison camps.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 The creators of \u201cSouth Park\u201d have issued a mock apology to China after censors scrubbed their popular animation from the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/8d6b5c_south-park-creators-matt-parker-trey-stone-frequently-skewer-authority-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
