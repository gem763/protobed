The Massachusetts Senator is up 19 percentage points from May, where she was at 8%.\n\nBiden is currently at 25%, a 9 percentage point drop from May.\n\nThis Monmouth poll follows two other early state polling, Iowa and Nevada, where Warren is also inching ahead or close to Biden to take the lead.\n\nPoll: More good news for Elizabeth Warren, within striking distance of Joe Biden in Nevada\n\nIowa Poll: Elizabeth Warren leads Register\u2019s Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders\n\nPatrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement that Warren is looking \"stronger with every new poll.\"\n\n\u201cShe seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,\u201d he continued.\n\nSen.
