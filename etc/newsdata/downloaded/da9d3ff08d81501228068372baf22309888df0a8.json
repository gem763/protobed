Max Rose\u2019s district in New York, 9 points in Rep. Kendra Horn\u2019s district in Oklahoma and by 13 points in Rep. Ben McAdams\u2019s district in Utah, according to the poll of registered voters.\n\nThese lawmakers played a key role in flipping control of the House to Democrats in the mid-term elections.\n\nThey\u2019re also key targets for Trump allies looking to highlight the political tightrope that centrist Democrats must walk, as the House gathers documents and testimony on Mr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nThe president\u2019s allies say Democrats in swing districts are abandoning their pledge to work in a bipartisan fashion on bread-and-butter issues.\n\n\u201cThis witch-hunt is obstructing progress on an America First agenda, including better trade deals, stronger border security, more funding for our troops and all the issues that will make a difference to everyday Americans,\u201d said Brian O. Walsh, president of American First Policies.\n\nHe said the nonprofit is \u201cmobilizing conservatives in important districts to make certain we hold members accountable and let them know it\u2019s time to end the witch-hunt, oppose impeachment and get back to the work of the American people.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry centers on whether Mr. Trump withheld military aid in exchange for dirt on a 2020 Democratic foe \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden \u2014 and his son, Hunter Biden, who had business ties in Ukraine.\n\nThe poll finds voters want House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to focus on issues like improving the economy and lowering health care costs, instead of impeachment, by a wide margin, ranging from 15 to 20 points in the trio of district polled.\n\nIt also suggests voters are open to the administration\u2019s decision to reach out to other countries in taking a second look at factors influencing the last presidential election.\n\nSpecially, America First\u2019s pollsters asked voters: \u201cDo you agree or disagree with the following statement: The Trump administration should work with foreign governments to investigate corruption and meddling in the 2016 election?\u201d\n\nVoters in Oklahoma\u2019s 5th congressional district said yes, 45 percentage points to 37, New York\u2019s 11th congressional district favored it, 50-41, while Utah\u2019s 4th congressional district split, 41-41, on the question.\n\nThe Washington Times reached out to each of the House Democrats cited in the polling. Mr. Rose\u2019s office said it would be unable to comment, due to the Yom Kippur holiday, while the others have not responded.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
