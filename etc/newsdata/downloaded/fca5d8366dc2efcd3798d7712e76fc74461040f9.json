But in her prepared remarks, obtained by Fox News, she denied asking any Ukrainian official to refrain from investigating corruption, and said it was \u201cfictitious\u201d that she was disloyal to the president.\n\n\u201cI have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the Embassy team to ignore the President\u2019s orders \u2018since he was going to be impeached.\u2019 That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing, to my Embassy colleagues or to anyone else,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also denies that the Obama administration asked her to harm the Trump campaign, or to help Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and said that she has never met Hunter Biden.\n\nTWO GIULIANI ASSOCIATED LINKED TO UKRAINE INVESTIGATIONS INDICTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CHARGES\n\n\u201cAnd although I have met former Vice President Joe Biden several times over the course of our many years in government, neither he nor the previous Administration ever, directly or indirectly, raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Giuliani, she said she was in contact with him three times as she can recall, none related to the controversy at hand -- and said that she did not know Giuliani\u2019s motives for going after her.\n\n\u201cBut individuals who may have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d she said.\n\nThat remark appeared to refer to the two associates of Giuliani who have been linked to his investigations in Ukraine, and who were indicted for campaign finance violations after being stopped at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on Wednesday.\n\nYovanovitch told lawmakers that she was told in April, just a month after her tour was extended a month before, to return \u201con the next plane.\u201d She then recalled a conversation with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who she says told her Trump had lost confidence in her after a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d and that he had been pressuring the department to remove her since the summer of 2018.\n\nIn her remarks, she said that the State Department had been attacked and hollowed out, and she predicted harm to the nation\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cThe harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe harm will come when bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHer statement revealed no new details about the circumstances surrounding Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky about Biden. Trump has said he was investigating corruption, while Democrats have accused him of using U.S. military aid as a quid pro quo for an investigation into a political rival.\n\nYovanovitch is not the only diplomat who will face lawmakers in the coming days. On Friday, E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland announced that he would comply with a subpoena and testify next week, despite objections from the State Department.\n\nFox News' Mike Emanuel, Ronn Blitzer and Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told lawmakers behind closed doors Friday that she was recalled earlier this year after \u201cunfounded and false claims\u201d against her, as well as continued pressure from President Trump on the State Department to remove her -- as she denied being \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the president.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/11/694940094001_6094060346001_6094058557001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
