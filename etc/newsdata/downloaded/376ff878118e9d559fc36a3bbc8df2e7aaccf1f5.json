I tried to go on and be there at the end. I\u2019d like to think we have enough runs.\u201d\n\nFinch bludgeoned three sixes and eight fours before holing out to Kusal Mendis at deep mid-wicket off left-arm spinner Lakshan Sandakan for 64 off 36 balls.\n\nThe Aussie skipper shared in a free-hitting opening stand of 122 with Warner and looked in ominous scoring form before he top-edged the leg-spinner in the 11th over.\n\nMaxwell showcased his wide range of improvised scoring shot-making skills in his 62 off just 28 balls, studded with three sixes and seven fours.\n\nHe partnered Warner in a 107-run stand and was dismissed, caught behind off Dasun Shanaka in the final over of the innings.\n\nIt was Australia\u2019s highest T20 total at home since their 221 against England in Sydney in 2007.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "David Warner emphatically bounced back to form with a first-ever Twenty20 century to power Australia to a prolific 233 for two against Sri Lanka in Adelaide on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EH27PHBUwAAKNSJ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
