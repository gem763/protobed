This is a step forward with very tangible markers in terms of protecting people of faith, and what president...is going to do is challenge these nations to ensure that, people regardless of their faith, when they publicly assemble to worship God that they don't have to do that in fear of terrorists or tyrants.\"\n\nPerkins said studies show countries that embrace and protect religious freedom have greater social and economic stability, benefiting America in the long run.\n\nJeffress added that Trump has made this a big part of his platform since the campaign trail.\n\n\"He said religious freedom is not granted by government it is gifted to us by God, and the president believes that,\" Jeffress said. \"The Democrats believe the great human right that transcends all others is the right to kill your own babies through abortion and the previous administration supported that for the world. ... This president says no, it's not the murder of babies that is a basic human right, it is religious liberty that is granted by our creator.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told \"Fox & Friends\" it \"wouldn't surprise\" her if Trump makes a surprise visit to the climate change event at the UN.", "description": "President Trump is reportedly skipping a climate change event Monday at the United Nations headquarters to give a historic speech on religious freedom and global persecution against believers.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
