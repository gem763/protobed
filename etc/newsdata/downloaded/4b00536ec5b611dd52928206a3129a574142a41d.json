Amazon Web Services, or AWS, pioneered the cloud computing business more than a decade ago and currently holds a leading 48 percent market share, according to market-research firm Gartner. Microsoft is the second largest with a 15.5 percent share.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe cloud computing contract, known as JEDI, is not only the military\u2019s largest information technology contract award in history, but is also expected to lead to other business across the federal government. Amazon was openly described by competitors and industry analysts as a clear front-runner due to its years of experience handling classified data for the CIA. The military also gave the company its highest data management certification. Microsoft\u2019s designation was one step below Amazon\u2019s.\n\nFew thought Microsoft would beat out Amazon for the massive contract, and legal analysts said the president\u2019s role in the procurement will almost certainly become the subject of litigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear here that the President of the United States did not want this contract to be awarded to one of the competitors,\u201d said Franklin Turner, an attorney with the law firm McCarter & English. \u201cAs a result its fairly likely that we will see a number of challenges that the procurement was not conducted on a level playing field.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMicrosoft should expect a near-term war, here,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a virtual guarantee that Amazon is going to pull out all the stops to check the government\u2019s math on this one.\u201d\n\nIn a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: \u201cThe acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nAll parties, the statement said, \u201cwere treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re surprised about this conclusion,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cAWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had initially been opposed to the idea of awarding such a massive contract to a single company, arguing such an approach would hamper innovation. \u201cWe believe the best approach is one that leverages the innovations of multiple cloud service providers,\u201d the company said early last year.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has openly spoken out against Amazon and its chief executive. He has attacked the Bezos-owned Washington Post for its coverage of him by conflating it with Amazon\u2019s interests. The president has called the news organization the \u201cAmazon Washington Post,\u201d while accusing it of publishing \u201cfake news\u201d and being a \u201clobbyist newspaper\u201d for the company.\n\nIn July, he retweeted a link to a Fox News segment that referred to the JEDI contract as the \u201cBezos bailout\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat same month \u2014 after a lawsuit and bid protests against the JEDI contract from Oracle and IBM were dismissed \u2014 the deal appeared to be headed in Amazon\u2019s favor.\n\nBut the White House in late July instructed Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper to reexamine the awarding of JEDI because of concerns that the deal would go to Amazon, officials close to the decision-making process told The Washington Post. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about the private conversations.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post then, Esper acknowledged he had heard from \u201cfolks in the administration\u201d about JEDI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a hard look at it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be making any decisions soon until I\u2019m comfortable with where it is and . . . then we\u2019ll look at what adjustments we need to make, if any.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEsper recused himself from the JEDI procurement process earlier this week, citing a conflict of interest. An IBM spokeswoman told The Post that Esper\u2019s son, Luke, \u201chas been a digital strategy consultant with IBM Services since February. His role is unrelated to IBM\u2019s pursuit of JEDI.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with Amazon\u2019s thinking said the company is \u201cevaluating options\u201d with regard to protesting the award. If Amazon filed a protest, the company would first need to raise concerns with the General Accounting Office. If that agency ruled that the Defense Department award was justified, Amazon could then appeal the matter to the Court of Federal Claims.\n\nAmazon this year chose to build a massive second headquarters, a few miles from the Pentagon\u2019s campus.\n\n\u201cClearly, AWS was perceived as the front runner to win this deal,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback. \u201cIt\u2019s a massively validating event for Microsoft.\"\n\nAD", "description": "Known as JEDI, the military's cloud computing contract goes to Microsoft after Trump expresses opposition to giving it to Amazon.
