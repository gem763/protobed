The Overland Park officer then handcuffed the teenager and took her to a nearby juvenile detention facility, where she was charged with a felony for threatening.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cToo often there are reports of violence in schools and inevitably questions about what could or should have been done to prevent the tragedy,\u201d the police statement said. \u201cThreats in schools are taken very seriously and treated appropriately.\u201d\n\nA week earlier, two 13-year-old boys in the Shawnee Mission School District school district brought guns hidden inside backpacks to their middle school six miles away. The Johnson County District Attorney\u2019s Office, which filed a felony charge against the Westridge girl, charged the boys with misdemeanors for being juveniles in possession of a firearm, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors defended that decision as critics questioned the disparity in charges.\n\n\u201cIt seems a little bit of an anomaly, you would think that having the actual gun that would be the more serious charge, but in fact it\u2019s the actual threat,\u201d Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe told WDAF.\n\nAD\n\nThe Westridge Middle School student, who hasn\u2019t been named as a juvenile, was released to her mother and is staying with her grandfather in California, the Star reported. Her grandfather told the newspaper he was worried about the girl\u2019s future, because the felony charge could carry up to a year in juvenile detention for what he believes was a childish joke. Cavanaugh said his granddaughter does not have access to a real gun at home.\n\nAD\n\nBut Howe told WDAF that the charge would probably not result in any time in detention, because the girl would likely be eligible for a program with more lenient penalties.\n\n\u201cIt would be extremely difficult, almost impossible, under the current juvenile justice system to actually send them to the correctional facility for that type of behavior because it is such a low-level offense, it would not meet the criteria needed,\u201d Howe told the TV station.\n\nAD\n\nPretending to fire a gun has recently landed people in trouble. A Pennsylvania court ruled in August that a man who pretended to shoot his neighbor by taking aim with his index finger \u201ccreated a hazardous condition\u201d and could be criminally charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nAD\n\nIn hope of preventing mass shootings, schools have suspended children for playing with pretend guns with regularity since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children and six adults working at the school.\n\nAD\n\nShortly after the girl in Kansas pointed the finger gun at her classmates last month, someone in the classroom reported the incident on the school district\u2019s online anti-bullying app, police told The Post. The girl and another classmate confirmed the story to school officials and a student resource officer later that same day, police said.\n\nAD\n\nThe girl will have her first hearing in juvenile court on Tuesday, the Star reported.\n\nA spokesman for the Shawnee Mission School District told The Post the school did not play a role in the arrest or charges. The district has its own police force and also works with local police departments that provide school resource officers.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to keep our students and staff and families, when they\u2019re in our building, safe,\u201d district spokesman David A. Smith told The Post. \u201cWe put a lot of energy and effort into building relationships with students, getting to know them. What we have found is when we do that, we know things, we hear things, we have relationships and [students] feel comfortable telling us when something is not as it should be.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "A Kansas girl faces a felony charge for pointing a finger pistol at four classmates after someone reported the incident in the school's anti-bullying app.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gcevmHXP96lZOjooE8x8IWMY0V8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C2FGEP3YVREYJI5BXEVTCNP7WI.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
