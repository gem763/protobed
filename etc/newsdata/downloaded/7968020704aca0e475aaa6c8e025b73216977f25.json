Even still, she continued to encourage Mr Urtula to take his own life.\u201d\n\nThe abuse was not only witnessed by friends and classmates but also recorded in Urtula\u2019s diary entries.\n\nIn the two months before his death Ms You sent her boyfriend 47,000 text messages that included \u201crepeated admonitions for Mr Urtula to \u2018go kill himself\u2019, to \u2018go die\u2019 and that she, his family, and the world would be better off without him\u201d.\n\nUrtula, a biology major, had completed his coursework and was working as a researcher at a hospital in New York.\n\nOn the day of his death, his family from New Jersey were in Boston to watch the graduation ceremony that was due to start at 10am.\n\nMs You was studying economics at the same university but dropped out in August and returned to her native South Korea.\n\nShe was indicted with involuntary manslaughter by a Suffolk County grand jury earlier this month and prosecutors are in negotiations with her lawyer to get her to return to the US voluntarily.\n\nIt comes two years after Michelle Carter, 20, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to kill himself in 2014. She was sentenced to 15 months in jail.\n\nCarter\u2019s lawyers claimed her texts were constitutionally protected free speech and have appealed to the US Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether it will take up the case.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\n\nRead more\n\nTeenager who trolled herself online then blamed ex-boyfriend is jailed", "description": "The girlfriend of a university student who killed himself hours before his graduation ceremony has been charged with manslaughter after she allegedly repeatedly told him to take his own life.Inyoung You, 21, sent a series of text messages telling Alexander Urtula, 22, to \u201cgo kill yourself\u201d or \u201cgo die", "authors": ["Peter Stubley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YLh4aYHGE6WMecP_QnZMrA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/5b136c8cd83c1f4ce95d74fa1956771d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
