His point was to demand U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, whom Washington had relied upon to fight the so-called Islamic State, get out. His subtext was that he was ready to violently extend the Turkish border southward, seizing Syrian territory.\n\nIn Ankara on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence gave Erdo\u011fan everything the Turks wanted in the long-telegraphed war Erdo\u011fan launched following a green light from President Donald Trump during a now-infamous Oct. 6 phone call. The U.S. did not even get the status quo ante.\n\nThe Turks did not agree to withdraw from Syrian territory. They agreed to a ceasefire, Pence announced. Over the next five days, the Kurdish forces that the U.S. abandoned are to withdraw approximately 20 miles south. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed not to implement new sanctions\u2014Sens. Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen introduced a new sanctions package as Pence briefed reporters\u2014and, should the Turkish ceasefire hold, will lift those the administration placed on Turkey after Trump\u2019s greenlight drew widespread backlash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ratification of what Donald Trump told the Turks they could do,\u201d assessed Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n\nA Turkish official told Middle East Eye, \u201cWe got exactly what we wanted out of the meeting.\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, even boasted that Turkey had agreed to do no more than \u201cpause\u201d its war for the five agreed-upon days. \u201cWe will only stop the operation if our conditions are met,\u201d Cavusoglu said.\n\nPence said he and the other members of the high-level U.S. delegation in Ankara, which included Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and new national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, had a brief to deliver no more than a ceasefire. \u201cThis will serve the interests of the Kurdish population in Syria,\u201d Pence insisted, crediting the agreement to \u201cPresident Trump and President Erdo\u011fan.\u201d\n\nIn Stein\u2019s view, it\u2019s more like an agreement between Erdo\u011fan and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After Trump ordered U.S. forces back from the Turkish front, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces reached a modus vivendi with the Russian-backed government of Bashar Assad that brought Syrian government fighters back into the area for the first time in about seven years. All these new facts on the ground\u2013the Turks in, the Syrian government in, the Americans back\u2013ensured Turkey would wind its operation down.\n\nErdo\u011fan and Putin have agreed to meet in Sochi on Oct. 22. \u201cAs soon as that date was reached,\u201d Stein said, \u201cthis thing was over.\u201d\n\nFaced with apparently unexpected anger over the abandonment of a U.S. partner in exchange for nothing, the Trump administration has spent the past week insisting against publicly available and observable information that it had opposed the Turkish invasion all along.\n\nA senior State Department insisted last week that Trump had given Erdo\u011fan a \u201cred light,\u201d despite the White House announcing Turkey\u2019s invasion in a statement that expressed no opposition and Trump\u2019s subsequent invitation of Erdo\u011fan to the White House in an Oct. 8 tweet. For days afterward, senior officials demanded Turkey end the war, only to be rebuffed. Turkish forces even fired on American-held positions that Pentagon officials had earlier declared Turkey knew about.", "description": "via REUTERSLast month, at the United Nations, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan waved a map of northeastern Syria before the world\u2019s dignitaries.
