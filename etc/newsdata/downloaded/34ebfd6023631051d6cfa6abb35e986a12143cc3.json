Barnes played for two-and-a-half seasons with the Dallas Mavericks, and now the couple is stepping in to help the community back in Dallas in a big way.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the Barneses have offered to pay for the funeral of Atatiana Jefferson, a Texas woman shot and killed by a Forth Worth Police Department officer last week.\n\nThat officer, Aaron Dean, has since resigned and been charged with Jefferson\u2019s murder.\n\nVia Twitter:\n\nFormer Dallas Maverick, now a Sacramento Kings player, @hbarnes and his wife @BrittanyLBarnes are playing for #AtatianaJefferson funeral in full. Amazing. No surprise \u2014 the couple continues to be philanthropic, especially here in DFW. \u2014 Allison Harris (@AllisonFox4News) October 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nJefferson was reportedly watching her 8-year-old nephew when a neighbor called in a welfare check to the non-emergency police line. The neighbor noticed her door was open, and police responded at 2:25 a.m.\n\nFrom NBC News:\n\nBody camera footage shows the perspective of the officer outside the home, peering inside a window using a flashlight, spotting someone inside standing near a window and telling her, \u201cPut your hands up \u2014 show me your hands,\u201d before shooting seconds later. At no point does he identify himself as an officer.\n\nThis is extremely generous on the part of the Barnes family and another example of how players can come to grow close to the places they play in.", "description": "Another example of how players can come to grow close to the places they play in.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eGMQQQapvSGAYFQrCllnTA--~B/aD02MDI7dz0xMDY5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d2b412f532c7ac4cba07b30ede98b3ad", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
