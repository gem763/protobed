Last year she required major surgery after debilitating back pain at work left her unable to sleep properly.\n\n\u201cI informed my supervisor about the situation but after a month of sick leave I didn\u2019t receive any payment,\u201d she says. \u201cThen they tried to say I was just on an extended holiday. Then that the surgery was aesthetic and they shouldn\u2019t cover it. \u2018We\u2019re not going to pay for your beauty surgery\u2019, they told me.\u201d\n\nShe recalls how stressful the experience was: \u201cI thought they would dismiss me. It was horrible, I got ill.\u201d\n\nOnce the IWGB union threatened action, the services company Cordant, her employer who are contracted to provide cleaning services on campus, promptly paid her the \u00a33,500 for the two-and-a-half months she had been off sick. The workers had been granted occupational sick pay following a previous campaign.\n\nVictoria is just one worker who has been able to win back their rights and days after the Guardian conducted these interviews, UoL announced its intention to bring security and cleaning staff in-house by November 2020.\n\nUniversities under fire for outsourcing low-paid campus jobs Read more\n\nPressure had been growing on the university to bring the workers in-house, with student anti-outsourcing demonstrations leading to a reported 200 events being relocated and the University and College Union voting to boycott Senate House.\n\nUnions warn that many more people are stuck in workplace disputes at universities due to language barriers and fears of managerial repercussions, with staff elsewhere speaking of being \u201cexploited\u201d by contracts that leave them treated like \u201coutcasts\u201d, and others describing alleged attempts to privatise them \u201cby stealth\u201d.\n\nKenneth \u2013 an outsourced security guard at UoL \u2013 said a sudden drop in his hours made him in effect part-time.\n\nThe father-of-four became depressed, struggled to pay his bills and had to stop sending money to his elderly grandmother \u2013 which she depends on.\n\nWhen he began working at Senate House last year, the insecurity of his initial contract meant he often did not know if he was working the next day. \u201cWe had to wait for them to structure our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make plans for ourselves.\u201d\n\nAlthough the IWGB union helped him to secure a 60-hour contract, he adds that being outsourced makes him feel like an \u201coutcast\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople want to feel a sense of belonging, like we work for the University of London. We don\u2019t feel like we belong to anywhere.\u201d\n\nCordant did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNames were changed to protect identities.", "description": "\u2018We don\u2019t feel like we belong to anywhere\u2019 : unions warn of exploitation in outsourcing", "authors": ["Mattha Busby", "Molly Blackall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca23b6c9937d3c0542c9e31d493166cd9409292c/0_205_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6465c2be9767984929acb27a7dabf8e7", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
