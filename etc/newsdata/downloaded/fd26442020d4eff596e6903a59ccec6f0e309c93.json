In a unanimous judgment read out by the court\u2019s president, Lady Hale, the justices ruled that the prime minister\u2019s action prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has summoned MPs to sit on September 25th. That will not allow enough time to hold the usual Question Time with the prime minister, but Mr Bercow said MPs could table urgent questions and motions. Mr Johnson is expected to cut short his trip to the United Nations in New York, and return in time for the sessions.\n\nOpposition leaders\u2014among them Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader who has brought forward his speech to the party\u2019s conference in Brighton\u2014called for Mr Johnson to resign. He is not likely to do that, but his own Tory party conference next week may now not take place.\n\nThe judgment is devastating for the prime minister. Not only did he lose on every legal point, and do so unanimously, but also the justices in effect implied that he had misled the queen when seeking her agreement to the suspension with advice that \u201cwas unlawful, void and of no effect.\u201d He had claimed this was necessary to prepare for a new legislative session to start on October 14th. The Supreme Court ruling says that it obstructed parliamentary scrutiny, declaring: \u201cThe effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d\n\nHow will this affect Brexit? Mr Johnson says he \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the ruling, and still insists that Britain will leave the EU \u201ccome what may\u201d on October 31st. Yet Parliament has legislated to insist that, if he has not secured a Brexit deal with the European Union by October 19th, he must seek an extension of that deadline. Although Mr Johnson insists he is making good progress towards an agreement, few in Brussels agree. The gap between the two sides over the so-called backstop to avert a hard border in Ireland is wide. The chances of a deal by mid-October still look small.\n\nThe judgment also plays into a broader constitutional crisis in Britain. Mr Johnson and his team are trying to portray MPs, big business, much of the media and now the judiciary as implacable opponents of Brexit, bent on thwarting the wishes of the majority of voters who supported Leave in June 2016. The Supreme Court would certainly deny the charge: Lady Hale said its decision was about the government\u2019s prerogative powers, not about Brexit at all. Yet Mr Johnson would like nothing better than to fight an election on a platform of the people versus the establishment.\n\nSo far Mr Corbyn has resisted calls for an early election (his agreement is needed because it takes a two-thirds majority of MPs to vote for dissolution). But when Parliament resumes, he will face pressure to change his mind, especially if Mr Johnson concedes that a no-deal Brexit will not in fact happen on October 31st. Whether an election can either resolve Brexit or repair Britain\u2019s battered constitution is quite another matter.", "description": "It rules that his suspension of Parliament was illegal", "authors": ["The Economist"], "top_image": "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/09/articles/main/20190928_brp501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
