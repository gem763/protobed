Authorities say she was arrested in Spain on Monday night and was being held there while authorities seek to extradite her to the United States.\n\nSui is the first person to be charged since June, when parent Jeffrey Bizzack pleaded guilty to paying $250,000 to get his son into the University of Southern California as a fake athlete. Dozens of others were charged in March when authorities announced the investigation.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Sui had an attorney to speak for her.\n\nProsecutors say Sui paid $400,000 to a sham charity operated by admissions consultant William \u201cRick\u201d Singer as part of a scheme to have her son admitted to UCLA as a fake soccer recruit. Sui is accused of providing Singer her son\u2019s transcript and photos of him playing tennis.\n\nSinger worked with Laura Janke, a former assistant soccer coach at USC, to fabricate an athletic profile depicting Sui\u2019s son as a top player on two private soccer clubs in Canada, prosecutors said. Both Singer and Janke have pleaded guilty.\n\nSui\u2019s son was admitted to UCLA as a soccer player in November 2018, authorities say, and was awarded a 25% scholarship.\n\nThe case was outlined in a March indictment against former UCLA soccer coach Jorge Salcedo that didn\u2019t identify Sui by name. The document said only that Salcedo accepted $200,000 to help two of Singer\u2019s clients get their children admitted as soccer recruits, including one in October 2018. Salcedo has pleaded not guilty.\n\nA statement from UCLA says it took \u201cimmediate corrective action\u201d after the March indictment was released. The school said privacy laws prevent it from discussing specific cases, but officials are \u201cnot aware of any currently enrolled student-athletes who are under suspicion\u201d by the Justice Department.\n\nThe alleged bribe ranks among the highest in the scheme. Some other parents are accused of making payments of up to $500,000, and some pursued the scheme multiple times, prosecutors say, with payments totaling up to $1.2 million.\n\nProsecutors did not explain why Sui was not part of the original group of parents charged. Court documents show Sui\u2019s indictment was filed in March but remained under seal until Tuesday.\n\nThe scandal has ensnared dozens of wealthy parents accused of paying bribes to rig their children\u2019s SAT and ACT scores or get them admitted as recruited athletes to elite schools across the nation, including Yale, Stanford and Georgetown universities.\n\nOf the 51 people previously charged, 23 have pleaded guilty, including \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman , who paid $15,000 to rig her daughter\u2019s SAT score. She was sentenced last week to 14 days in prison, 250 hours of community service and a $30,000 fine.\n\nAnother 28 defendants are contesting the charges against them, including \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who are accused of paying to get their two daughters into USC as fake athletes on the crew team.", "description": "She is the 52nd person charged in a sweeping college admissions bribery scheme", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR476_ucla09_ZG_20190917155757.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
