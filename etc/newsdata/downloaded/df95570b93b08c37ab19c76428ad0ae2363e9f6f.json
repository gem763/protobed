A year later she needed to hold books close to her face as her vision was fading and by the age of five she would occasionally fall and her walk became unusual.\n\nAt six, Mila was blind, could barely speak and was having seizures.\n\nThe disease can be caused by a range of genetic mutations that stop cells being able to break down and recycle waste.\n\nInstead, junk builds up and it can lead to the death of brain cells.\n\nThe route to therapy\n\nMila's family had been given a diagnosis of Batten disease and they knew it was genetic.\n\nThey began a campaign - Mila's Miracle Foundation - in the hope of curing the incurable.\n\n\"I was sitting down to dinner one night and my wife told me a friend of hers had shared a Facebook post from a family in Colorado seeking help,\" Dr Timothy Yu told the BBC.\n\nHe first met Mila in January 2017 and what followed was incredibly rapid and unprecedented.\n\nThe team in Boston performed whole-genome sequencing - a detailed interrogation - on Mila's DNA, her genetic code, and uncovered a unique mutation that was causing her disease.\n\nHaving seen the fault, the researchers thought it might be possible to treat it.\n\nThey designed a drug, tested it on Mila's cells and on animals in the laboratory and won approval to use it from the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nMila was treated with the drug - named Milasen - on 31 January 2018.\n\nDrugs normal take around a decade-and-a-half to get from the laboratory, go through clinical trials and get to patients.\n\nThe US team got there in a year.\n\n\"When we stopped and looked back we were really proud and surprised. Sometimes it's helpful to be naive, and knowing we had a child who was declining as we were doing the work motivated everyone to move incredibly fast,\" Dr Yu said.\n\nHe added: \"We're not aware of another case where another drug has been tailored in this way.\"\n\nImage copyright Boston Children's Hospital\n\nWhat does it mean for Mila?\n\nThe drug cannot undo all the damage that has been done.\n\n\"I would say for the first year we were really thrilled. It seemed there was very little progression of the disease,\" Dr Yu told the BBC.\n\nThis is a disease where the decline is normally inexorable.\n\nThe frequency of Mila's seizures plummeted from 15-30 a day (typically lasting around two minutes) to between zero and 20 a day, mostly lasting just a few seconds.\n\nHer family reported she was standing straighter and swallowing better.\n\nThere are signs in her second year of treatment that the disease is advancing again and Mila continues to be closely monitored.\n\n\"We think it's progressing more slowly than it would otherwise and we hold out hope it may stabilise further,\" Dr Yu said.\n\nHe believes that if in future cases it is possible to intervene even earlier - when a child is three or four - that \"could really make a big difference\".\n\nHow does the drug work?\n\nThe approach used is incredibly clever and required a precise understanding of exactly what was going wrong.\n\nOne genetic instruction for building a protein was defective in Mila's DNA and the resulting ineffective protein was causing her Batten disease.\n\nTo get from DNA to a protein there is a stage in the middle - a messenger (mRNA) is created that takes the instructions from the DNA in a cell's nucleus to the site where proteins are made.\n\nBut there was a problem with building the messenger.\n\nNot all of the genetic code in a section of DNA is copied over into the mRNA - parts are cut out in a process known as splicing.\n\nBut in Mila's case the splicing was going wrong, so the wrong messenger was being made and a faulty protein was the result.\n\nThe team developed a drug that sticks to the forming mRNA and stops it being cut in the wrong the place.\n\nIt is the same technology - antisense oligonucleotide therapy - that is offering the first hope of treating the devastating disease Hungtinton's.\n\nThe details have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nImage copyright Boston Children's Hospital Image caption Mila had the drug injected into her spinal fluid\n\nHow much did all this cost?\n\nHow much this highly personalised therapy costs is going to be one of the major barriers to more people benefiting.\n\nThe research team will not say how much they spent developing the drug.\n\nBut Dr Yu said: \"We wouldn't have taken it forward if we didn't see a path to making this accessible.\n\n\"The idea of millions of dollars for drugs for millionaires does not sit well with what we're doing.\"\n\nCould this be a new approach to medicine?\n\nYes.\n\nThere are more than 7,000 rare diseases caused by genetic abnormalities, which often lack any form of treatment.\n\nNot all rare diseases - or even all patients with Batten disease - could be treated in the same way as Mila.\n\nBut the hope is that truly personalised medicine, based on a detailed genetic understanding of what is causing a disease could lead to this kind of precision treatments.\n\nDr Janet Woodcock, from the drug regulatory body the US Food and Drug Administration, said individualised medicines, known as N-of-one because they are used by just one person, throw up new issues.\n\nShe said: \"In these 'N-of-one' situations, what type of evidence is needed before exposing a human to a new drug?\n\n\"Even in rapidly progressing, fatal illnesses, precipitating severe complications or death is not acceptable, so what is the minimum assurance of safety that is needed?\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter", "description": "Mila is having far fewer - and briefer - seizures after a drug was designed just for her.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0487/production/_109195110_213684_web.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
