REUTERS/Simon Dawson/Files\n\nThe warning underlines the challenges facing Page, who became chief executive officer in April, after misconduct allegations against Ted Baker founder and top shareholder Ray Kelvin. The company also tapped a new finance chief last week.\n\nTed Baker and other high-street retailers face several challenges: weak consumer demand brought on by political uncertainty related to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, heavy discounting and the shift to online shopping.\n\nOther brands have also complained about a tough climate, although the world\u2019s second-biggest fashion retailer H&M (HMb.ST) reported its first quarterly rise in pretax profit in over two years on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have faced probably the most difficult trading conditions that I can ever recall in 30 years,\u201d Page told Reuters.\n\nTed Baker, known for suits, shirts and dresses with quirky details, posted a first-half pretax loss partly due to unseasonably warm weather in September.\n\nBut wider issues plaguing the sector led it to caution that second-half results could be lower, setting its shares on course for their biggest one-day drop. The stock has more than halved in value since Kelvin stepped down.\n\n\u201cTed Baker has been thrown onto the market\u2019s discount pile after a shocker of a first half results statement,\u201d said AJ Bell\u2019s investment director Russ Mould.\n\nThe profit warning comes days after fast-fashion retailer Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy in the United States, where Ted Baker has more than 30 shops and sells at Bloomingdale\u2019s stores.\n\nIn March, Ted Baker reported its first drop in full-year profit since 2008 and in June flagged an \u201cextremely difficult\u201d start to the year as it was recovering from Kelvin\u2019s departure.\n\nKelvin, 62, who had been CEO since the company\u2019s launch in 1988, resigned in March over claims he presided over a culture of \u201cforced hugging\u201d. He denied allegations of misconduct.\n\nTed Baker in June said it expected annual underlying pretax profit to be between 50 million pounds ($61 million) and 60 million pounds. Analysts at Liberum cut their full-year 2020 pretax profit forecast by about 39% on Thursday.\n\nThe company reported a pretax loss of 23 million pounds, compared to a profit of 24.5 million pounds a year ago, for the six months ended Aug. 10.\n\nThe retailer, which has about 500 stores and concessions globally, said its retail operating costs excluding one-time items rose 2.8% to 119.7 million pounds in the reported period.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s first half update from Ted Baker is a massive disappointment to those who felt that the company\u2019s problems were behind it,\u201d said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.", "description": "Shares in Ted Baker shed more than a third of their value on Thursday, after the British fashion retailer's second profit warning in four months on the back of what new boss Lindsay Page called the worst business conditions in decades.", "authors": ["Tanishaa Nadkar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436552493&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920BY"}
