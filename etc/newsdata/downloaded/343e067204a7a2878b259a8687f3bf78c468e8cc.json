REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nBut in China, the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle market where Tesla is gearing up for a major sales push, that tune has started to change as the automaker promotes racing events, showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps.\n\nCase in point: Wang Yubo, a 30-year-old marketing executive and Tesla car owner, was invited by the company to burnish his driving skills at a Shanghai racing track this month.\n\n\u201cI learned how to push my Model 3 to its limits,\u201d said Wang, who writes both enthusiastic and critical blogs about Tesla and occasionally races his car with friends.\n\nTesla is expanding its focus beyond products to service, says Leo Liu, head of the company\u2019s China driving school which aims to teach people \u201cto make full use of their cars\u201d.\n\nIt held three such events for auto reporters, social media influencers and a handful of owners in August - one in Beijing and two in Shanghai and plans to expand to other big cities such as Guangzhou and Chengdu.\n\n\u201cWe are also thinking of having more difficult ones on ice tracks in winter this year,\u201d Liu said, adding that more owners will be invited in the future.\n\nWhile Tesla hasn\u2019t embarked on conventional TV or billboard advertising, the U.S. firm\u2019s China Chief Tom Zhu has been working on strategies this year to boost the brand\u2019s appeal, frequently seeking ideas and opinions from marketing and sales experts, sources familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe sources were not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified. Tesla declined to comment.\n\nBIG FACTORY, BIG PLANS\n\nHelping raise his profile in China, Musk is currently visiting the country and on Thursday held a discussion with Alibaba\u2019s (BABA.N) Jack Ma at an AI industry event, although they avoided controversial issues like the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nTesla\u2019s new efforts to reach customers in China come as the Silicon Valley automaker is preparing to open a big vehicle assembly factory in Shanghai and confront fierce competition in the luxury electric vehicle market it invented.\n\nThe firm\u2019s first overseas factory is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases.\n\nThat would translate to nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year, according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive.\n\nThe plant is slated to have annual output capacity of 250,000 vehicles after production of the Model Y is added.\n\n\u201cWe have to learn how to manage a larger sales and after-sales system as production is growing to a completely different level,\u201d said one source. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are doing these events now.\u201d\n\nThe sources added, however, that Tesla is spending far less than what a conventional carmaker in China would be spending on marketing.\n\nIn Tesla\u2019s favor, it has been exporting cars to China since 2014 and remains the benchmark that other automakers in China often compare their electric vehicles to when they advertise.\n\nThe launch of the Model 3 for the Chinese market in late February has also gone well, sending Tesla\u2019s China revenue jumping 42% to $1.5 billion in the first half - equivalent to 13.5% of total revenue.\n\nBut Tesla in China doesn\u2019t have the headstart in all-electric vehicles that it had in the U.S. market when it debuted the Model S in 2012.\n\nChinese startup Nio Inc (NIO.N) sells two premium all-electric SUVs, Jaguar has launched is I-PACE SUV and BMW (BMWG.DE) has its i3 hatchback and i8 sportscar. By the end of the year, Audi will have two all-electric SUVs on the market while Daimler\u2019s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes will have one.\n\nThe U.S firm also doesn\u2019t expect Musk\u2019s cult status to propel sales to the same extent it does elsewhere, the sources said.\n\nMost Chinese do not have easy access to his Twitter feed followed by nearly 28 million, although Tesla translates some of his less controversial tweets on its Weibo account.\n\nIn addition to chat app stickers that express various emotions - a market strategy also used by other automakers - Tesla is partnering with Tencent\u2019s (0700.HK) QQ Music streaming service in organizing parties with DJs at showrooms.\n\nBoth marketing tactics are China-only developments, the sources said.\n\nSocial media users have noticed much more activity on Tesla\u2019s Weibo account in recent months while company has also held several roundtables with reporters and internet influencers throughout China since July.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nAccording to sources, executives explained pricing strategy and expansion plans for its charging network and said they wanted to improve communication with the public.\n\nBy contrast, in the United States Tesla rarely grants media access to its executives beyond earnings calls and product launches.\n\n\u201cTesla has finally realized the importance of adjusting to China,\u201d said Wang. \u201cGiven time, it will become more mature.\u201d", "description": "Tesla Inc has always shown disdain for marketing, with CEO Elon Musk boasting his company does not advertise, instead using the money it would have spent to develop products.", "authors": ["Yilei Sun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424283980&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T09U"}
