On one hand, that sounds like an awful experience. On the other hand, could a tablespoon of teeny seeds really be the culprit? A cursory online search yielded a Cerberus of uninformed speculation, contradictory answers, and flat-out conspiracies. So, I posed the question to some actual toxicology experts: Could poppy seeds make you fail a drug test?\n\nTo start, it\u2019s important to know how these seeds affect the body. Most drug tests, called an immunoassay test, screen a person\u2019s urine for morphine and metabolites (breakdown products) of morphine, which can indicate the presence of both heroin and cocaine. Because poppy seeds come from the poppy plant, as does heroin, the seeds contain trace amounts of morphine and related chemicals. Depending on the way specific poppy seeds are processed, just how much of those trace amounts they contain varies widely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew Stolbach, a medical toxicology and emergency medicine physician at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, tells The Takeout there could be as much as 30-fold variability in terms of how much morphine the seeds contain, depending on how they\u2019re processed.\n\n\u201cA small package of poppy seeds is about 35 grams. To put it in perspective, to get what would be considered a standard dose of morphine with what we typically see as the amount of morphine in poppy seeds, you\u2019d have to take all of the small container. And on the lowest reported end [of morphine concentration], you\u2019d have to take all of a big container, nearly a pound,\u201d Stolbach says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that does mean it\u2019s possible that poppy seed bagel lovers could fail a drug test, especially if they\u2019ve consumed said bagel within 12 hours of the test. The National Institute On Drug Abuse notes that poppy seeds could raise the levels of opium-derived chemicals in a person\u2019s body for up to three days.\n\n\u201cDifferent suppliers might process their poppy seeds differently, but all are risky for the testing,\u201d says Charles Chavkin, a professor of pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. \u201cIt depends on the threshold used by the test, but a couple of poppy seed muffins or bagels could be sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoppy seeds can also, in rare cases, be toxic. Chavkin says that could occur if a person makes a very strong tea from the unripe capsule of the opium poppy, but it\u2019s not likely at all with standard muffins or bagels.\n\nIn order to prevent positive test results due to poppy seed consumption, the federal government in 2017 raised its threshold for morphine to 2,000 nanograms per milliliter from 300 nanograms per milliliter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy raising the cutoff, they\u2019ve reduced this poppy seed problem by a great deal,\u201d Stolbach says. \u201cNow, it\u2019s possible [to fail the drug test] if you really eat a lot of poppy seeds, but it\u2019s unlikely.\u201d\n\nIf a person does fail an initial drug test, they might be asked to do a second confirmatory test, Stolbach says. At that point, the person should point out that the positive result was due to their ingestion of poppy seeds\u2014and make sure to skip the poppy seed muffin beforehand.", "description": "Every few months, I stumble across an account from someone who claims to have failed a drug test due to a poppy seed bagel, muffin, or bread.
