We put three kids in one bedroom and we do bunk beds so they can sleep.\"\n\nAs the housing coordinator for the Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council (MIIC), Winnipeg's largest refugee settlement agency, it's her job to find affordable homes for refugees fleeing to Canada. That means Cerka has to overcome some significant barriers.\n\nThe clock starts ticking the moment refugees land at the airport. Cerka has 14 calendar days to find them a place. That's how long people can stay in transitional housing at Welcome Place, run by MIIC.\n\n'The Budget Issue'\n\n\"The most difficult part is the budget issue,\" said Cerka. \"The money they get, it's not enough.\"\n\nValentina Cerka crunches the numbers. She says what refugees get from the federal government for rent often doesn't match what landlords are charging.

How much they get is determined by the size of the family and the age of the children.\n\nThe family of seven, with two adults and five kids under 18, will receive $1,060 a month for rent and utilities. According to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the average price of a three bedroom apartment in Winnipeg was $1,446 in 2018.\n\n\"I know those are the rates that are set, but they don't match reality,\" said Cerka.\n\nSearch and negotiate\n\nCerka has learned to be a good negotiator. She is constantly asking landlords to lower the rent, to accommodate large families, and to rent to people who have no guarantor, no credit or rental history in Canada.\n\nCerka negotiates with a landlord, trying to bring prices down for her clients. (Photo courtesy Valentina Cerka)\n\nShe knows that some landlords have strict regulations around siblings of different genders and different age groups sharing bedrooms. She doesn't call them if she is working with a large family, so Winnipeg's 2.9 per cent vacancy rate shrinks even lower.\n\nIf my family can't live there, why can they? - Valentina Cerka\n\nThen there are the bugs.\n\nCockroaches, bed bugs, mice infestations, Cerka sees them all in her search for affordable housing. She works with landlords to deal with these problems before she lets families sign leases.\n\n\"I ask myself, 'Can I live there with my son?'\" said Cerka. \"If my family can't live there, why can they?\"\n\nFinding a home after fleeing violence\n\nCerka identifies with her clients because she arrived in Canada as a refugee herself. She fled Albania for Yugoslavia, where she lived in a refugee camp and gave birth to her son. Then war broke out and she fled again, this time arriving in Winnipeg in 1993 with her seven-month-old baby.\n\n\"I didn't have to suffer that much because the rental rates were not this high,\" said Cerka. She took the first apartment settlement workers showed her. They moved to a cheaper place the following year while she went to school and worked.\n\nWhen Valentina Cerka arrived in Winnipeg as a refugee, her son Mikael was just seven months old. (Photo courtesy Valentina Cerka)\n\nAfter becoming a single mother in 1997, Cerka worked four jobs in order to buy a small house. She remembers carrying her sleeping child to the car at 3 a.m. so she could deliver newspapers before starting her day job at Welcome Place. Evenings and weekends were spent working as a waitress.\n\nCerka cries every time she tells her story. She feels guilty for not spending more time with her son when he was young. It's something they've talked about.\n\n\"I said, 'I hope you don't hate me, and I hope you realize that what I did, I did it for you because [the] home we have, it's going to be yours.'\" said Cerka. Her son reassured her that he is grateful for all of her sacrifices.\n\n'It's like I'm looking at myself'\n\nBack in her office, Cerka congratulates two clients, brothers, who are moving into a two bedroom unit on the upper floor of a duplex. If they pool their rent money, $695 each, they can afford the $900 rent and utilities.\n\n\"They're happy! They like it,\" said Cerka. \"They're moving before the 14 days, so that's perfect.\"\n\nCerka and her staff have found housing for 180 people so far this year, including 59 families. Cerka celebrates each success.\n\n\"Looking at these people it's like I'm looking at myself, what I was when I came here,\" said Cerka. \"l needed this help, and these people need this help, so I have to do it. It's a responsibility.\"\n\nThen she picks up the phone again, still on the search for a place for the family of seven \u2014 and the ones who will arrive after them.", "description": "Valentina Cerka has 14 days to find government sponsored refugees permanent housing.
