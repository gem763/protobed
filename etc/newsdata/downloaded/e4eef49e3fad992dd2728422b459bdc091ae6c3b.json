(Adrian Wyld/THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nScheer is campaigning today in three ridings held by the Liberals in Winnipeg.\n\n\"My thoughts are with all of the families who are affected by the snowstorms in Manitoba,\" Scheer tweeted earlier today.\n\n\"Canada's Conservatives are committed to ensuring Indigenous communities have the energy infrastructure needed to maintain essential services.\"\n\nNearly all of the roughly 680 people living at Lake Manitoba had to make a sudden two-hour drive southeast to Winnipeg on Saturday after their power went out.\n\n\"Try dealing with the crisis instead of looking for votes,\" said Edward Prince, another evacuee from the First Nation. \"Look after the people.\"\n\nFollowing his campaign announcement at the hotel \u2014 which was to list the policy priorities of an incoming Conservative government over its first 100 days \u2014 Scheer said he had made a personal donation to storm relief through the Red Cross but would not disclose the sum.\n\nPrince and Missyabit said the evacuation process was disorganized and they still don't have enough food or water. Missyabit said she is not getting any assistance for her 19-year-old disabled son.\n\n\"We're not animals to be shuffled around like this,\" Missyabit said. \"It's frustrating.\"\n\nNearly 21,000 Manitoba homes and businesses remained without power early Monday in the wake of a snowstorm that the province's Crown energy utility said had left an unprecedented amount of damage to transmission lines, towers and more \u2014 damage that will take days to repair.\n\n\"First Nations should be dealt with,\" Prince said. \"This is ridiculous. A lot of us don't even have a change of clothes.\"\n\nDamage from downed trees and power lines posed hazards in Portage la Prairie. (Ahmar Khan/CBC)\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross opened a warming shelter at the RBC Convention Centre in downtown Winnipeg over the weekend for the First Nations, which it said was necessary because of the potential number of evacuees as well as a lack of available hotel rooms. A Red Cross spokesperson told CBC News it's prepared to set up another shelter that could double the number of people it can support.\n\nPremier Brian Pallister declared a state of emergency early Sunday morning.\n\nSerious infrastructure damage in Portage la Prairie.

That's their priority right now and so we've made that decision.\"", "description": "Evacuees in Manitoba driven from their homes by a massive recent snowstorm that cut off power to thousands said today they were annoyed by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's decision to campaign in Winnipeg today.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Olivia Stefanovich Is A Senior Reporter For Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau Based In Ottawa.
