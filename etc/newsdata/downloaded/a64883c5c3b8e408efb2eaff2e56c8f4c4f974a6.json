While many protests were peaceful there were also deadly incidents of arson and looting, as well as violent clashes between the security forces and protesters.\n\nThey have shown little sign of abating despite Mr Pi\u00f1era announcing measures to ease Chileans' discontent with high levels of inequality and other grievances.\n\nMore than 7,000 people have been arrested and the response by Mr Pi\u00f1era's government to the protests has come under heavy criticism.\n\nHe declared a state of emergency in many of Chile's major cities and night-time curfews but the measures only seemed to further incense protesters.\n\nA rally on Saturday is estimated to have drawn more than one million people to the streets of the capital, Santiago, in what organisers said was the largest demonstration since democracy was restored in Chile in 1990.", "description": "The country will also no longer host next month's Apec trade summit, as mass protests continue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F2B8/production/_109463126_mediaitem109463122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
