If you\u2019re allergic to pollen, why would that cause an allergic reaction to oranges or peaches? And how come these new allergies aren\u2019t showing up on diagnostic tests?\n\nA mouthful of symptoms\n\nConnecting the dots\n\nSeasonal Allergy Associated Food Allergy Birch pollen Apple | Almond | Carrot | Celery |Cherry| Hazelnut |Kiwi |Peach |Pear | Plum Grass pollen Celery |Melons |Oranges | Peaches | Tomato Ragweed pollen Banana | Cucumber |Melons | Sunflower | Zucchini\n\nTypically affecting older kids, teens, and young adults\u2014unexpected and unexplained food allergies are showing up increasingly often . And this allergy mystery had the experts puzzled.Food allergy symptoms can be similar to common seasonal allergies. But diagnostic tests that reliably confirm a seasonal allergy rarely confirmed a food allergy. But why? Food allergies are common enough. And although some come with dire reactions, many of the more typical reactions\u2014itchy, watery eyes, sneezes, hives, rashes, constant runny nose\u2014really disrupt people\u2019s lives. Especially when the symptoms aren\u2019t seasonal, but persist year-round. A key insight emerged when experts nailed down what made these new food allergies different than seasonal allergies\u2014the first symptoms people reported were swelling and itchiness of the lips, mouth, tongue, and throat immediately after eating a certain fruit, vegetable, seed, or nut. That wasn\u2019t the way typical seasonal allergies announce themselves.The new phenomenon earned a name of its own: oral allergy syndrome. And it\u2019s now estimated that more than 60 percent of all food allergies are somehow associated with seasonal allergies. That\u2019s a lot of discomfort for a lot of people. But how to connect the dots? Enough data came in to show that common seasonal allergies were definitely connected to allergic reactions to certain foods:\n\nIt\u2019s cross-reactivity\n\nKeep your fingers off the triggers\n\nBut why? What connects ragweed and zucchini? Birch pollen and hazelnuts? It took a long time to put all the pieces together.Our immune system is fearless, diligent, and powerful. It\u2019s on the job 24 hours a day, every day, throwing its best protective and destructive stuff at every unwanted intruder. But sometimes, it mistakes a harmless presence\u2014a food, for example\u2014for a dangerous one. The result is \u201cfriendly fire,\u201d good guys attacking good guys. But still\u2026why? Now we know. When a seasonal allergy sufferer eats an associated \u201ctrigger\u201d fruit, nut, seed, or vegetable, the immune system sees familiar proteins\u2014very similar to those associated with the underlying seasonal allergies themselves. So our rapid response immunity team leaps into fight mode, in a process called cross-reactivity. The outcome of the battle is an allergic reaction. What\u2019s not yet understood is the seemingly random timing\u2014why the immune system suddenly decides that what we\u2019ve eaten for years is a threat. Research will eventually find ways to obstruct or eliminate oral allergy syndrome . Meanwhile, here\u2019s what various experts recommend to keep it at bay.Obviously, the surest way to prevent an oral allergic reaction is to avoid your trigger foods. Fortunately, there are ways to \u201cde-fang\u201d your trigger foods so you can still enjoy them.A great many reaction-causing proteins reside in a fruit or vegetable\u2019s skin. Just peeling them before eating\u2014wearing gloves\u2014can reduce the likelihood or intensity of a reaction.\n\nFruit juice alone, without the whole fruit\u2019s flesh and skin, is little more than liquid sugar that tastes good\u2014and lacks the whole plant\u2019s fibers. Also, by pressing, you may activate enzymes and protein that change the nutritional profile.\n\nMany commercial smoothies contain raw, unpasteurized juices or purees that might be among your trigger foods.\n\nAll sorts of breakfast cereals, trail mixes, energy bars, and the like contain nuts, or were processed in a plant where nuts have also been processed.\n\nWith some trigger foods, cooking can destroy the proteins that cause oral allergy reactions. If, for example, you love tomatoes, apples, potatoes, pears, or (most) soft fruits, breathe a sigh of relief. But if nuts, some spices, strawberries, or celery are your trigger food, you\u2019re out of luck. Nuts and strawberries, bless their sweet hearts, contain heat-resistant allergens. Sorry. What about juices? If they\u2019ve been pasteurized, they\u2019ve been cooked\u2014so many fruit and veggie juices are usually okay. But a few caveats:So read the ingredients labels before consuming, well, almost everything.Pop the fruits or veggies in the microwave on a low power setting for about a minute, then chill them immediately. This may deter or reduce the allergic reaction. It eliminates the main reaction-causing proteins, and works especially well for apples. Of course, protecting against the underlying seasonal allergy will also make a world of difference. That means, as always, a healthy diet and lifestyle. Those in themselves will keep your immune system humming along. But it certainly doesn\u2019t mean resorting to Big Pharma\u2019s billion-dollar OTC babies. There are safer and more affordable natural remedies that are equally or more effective. Here are some recommendations.\n\nAs always, nature provides wonderful solutions.sounds like an unlikely allergy-remedy. But five human clinical studies show that it can actually halt allergy symptoms starting in just 15 minutes. And folks who took it daily for three months or more reported their symptoms all but disappeared.is a member of the sunflower family. It\u2019s proven effective against allergies\u201490 percent of patients improved in clinical trials, making butterbur as effective as Big Pharma\u2019s big earners, Zyrtec\u00ae and Allegra\u00ae., an extract of rosemary, has proven anti-allergenic properties, reducing the histamine production that is part of every reaction., a compound found in many fruits and vegetables, particularly onions, performs as well as pharmaceutical drugs in clinical trials., an enzyme from pineapple, has anti-inflammatory abilities that make it another good choice for treating seasonal allergies. Extracts ofhave been used for centuries to treat allergies. Consult with your doctor on the suitability and dosages best for you.is a healing technique that uses micro-doses of allergens to treat specific symptoms, \u201ctraining\u201d the immune system to not attack them when they\u2019re present. Remedies are packaged according to symptoms\u2014runny nose, itchy eyes, cough and so on, making it easy to find the one you need.\n\nThe fewer allergens, the better, outside and in. You can\u2019t do much about the ones outside. But you can reduce exposure to pollen and dust mites in your home. There are mattresses and pillow covers, for example, made to control dust mites. For a super-cleanup, I recommend a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air filtration device. You\u2019ll be amazed at what you\u2019ve been living with when it\u2019s been running for a while. Finally, a tip from NASA\u2019s playbook: green plants, which those super-smart scientists call \u201cliving air filters.\u201d Get plants big enough for at least 6-inch containers, and put out one plant for every 100 to 120 square feet of space. Note: no flowering plants\u2014pollen. If you experience oral allergy syndrome reactions, or a sudden new food allergy, let your doctor know right away. As I said, food allergies are rarely truly threatening. But be like your immune system\u2014be safe rather than sorry. I hope this will help you breathe easier.
