Yezi Zhang, a college student, was there, too, and her emotions were decidedly mixed.\n\nMs. Zhang, a 24-year-old from the city of Hangzhou, was among a few thousand Chinese fans who showed up at the Mercedes-Benz Arena despite the N.B.A.\u2019s clash with the Chinese government. Beijing officials have put growing pressure on the N.B.A. to apologize after an executive at the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The N.B.A., citing free speech, has said the executive won\u2019t be punished.\n\nIf the league doesn\u2019t fully apologize, Ms. Zhang said, then she and the league might be over.\n\n\u201cAt first I was quite happy about the game, but then after the recent issue I started feeling quite awkward,\u201d she said, adding that she dare not post images of the game online for fear of disapproval from friends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to chase the star players,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t do it at the cost of the dignity of the motherland.\u201d", "description": "An exhibition game between the Lakers and the Nets may signal a thaw.
