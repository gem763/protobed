Should we do that or is it better to take a lump sum?\n\nMore and more pensioners are finding a shortfall between their incomings and outgoings\n\nAge Partnership's Andrew Morris replies: With pension incomes falling and increasing household bills, we are finding more customers are looking at ways to bridge the deficit between income and outgoings.\n\nOne of the first things we need to understand is whether the shortfall is for the rest of your lives or for a set amount of time, for example, until your state pension starts. This will help shape the options you should consider.\n\nIf the shortfall is for a set period of time then equity release may be a suitable solution and should be considered alongside other options like any other savings or assets that you could access.\n\nBut if the shortfall is for the rest of your life, then equity release may not provide enough money to solve the problem.\n\nIn this case, downsizing or perhaps taking in a lodger may be a more suitable solution?\n\nShould you wish to explore equity release, I\u2019ll outline the options available to you and the questions you should ask.\n\nThe most common type of equity release plan is a lifetime mortgage and with this type of plan there is the option to take the money you require as an upfront lump sum or to take the money on a drawdown basis.\n\nThis is where an initial lump sum is released and then further withdrawals can be taken in the future from a pre-agreed facility.\n\nAge Partnership adviser Andrew Morris\n\nThis gives you the flexibility to take money as and when needed. Debit interest is only accrued on money once it has been released, either initially or from the reserve. So with drawdown plans you don\u2019t build up interest on money that you don\u2019t need right now.\n\nAs you only want a monthly top up, a lump sum alone would appear to be the wrong option, and a drawdown plan may be more suitable as you can release money as and when you need it.\n\nYou would need to release a minimum of at least \u00a310,000 at the start and the minimum drawdown amount usually ranges between \u00a31,000 - \u00a35,000 per-withdrawal.\n\nThese minimum amounts may be too large for your needs and may mean accruing debit interest on money you are not using \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t be something I would advise.\n\nYou\u2019re correct in your reference to a new type of equity release product which provides a regular monthly income, it\u2019s called an income lifetime mortgage.\n\nYou can choose to take the income for a fixed term, typically between 10 to 25 years, with a minimum initial cash sum, typically \u00a32,500.\n\nThe level of income available and the term available will be dependent upon property value and your age.\n\nIncome withdrawals usually start at \u00a3200 per month and are therefore smaller than the minimum withdrawal on some drawdown options. This can result in less interest being built up over the long term.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting though that the interest rate will be set at the prevailing rates at the time you draw down. So unlike a lump sum plan you won\u2019t know what interest rate will apply to the income until it is taken.\n\nThe equity release market has doubled in size in three years, with \u00a33.6billion released in 2018\n\nWith both of these options the money released is secured against the home and debit interest is accrued on the borrowing. Interest or capital payments are usually allowable, but if they are not made then the interest is compounded.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that all plans which meet Equity Release Council product standards offer a no negative equity guarantee, which means you can\u2019t pass on debt to your estate.\n\nIn summary, a drawdown option or an income plan may be suitable but it would be dependent on your personal circumstances, how much you need each month and for what period of time.\n\nThe traditional lump sum would appear not to meet your needs as it will accrue too much debit interest on money you are not using. I recommend speaking to a qualified equity release adviser to discuss your options.\n\nWill Kirkman of This is Money adds: While equity release is right for some, it comes with some significant drawbacks that you should be aware of, the biggest being the compound interest that comes with a roll-up plan.\n\nAs there are no monthly repayments, the interest is added to your loan, meaning that charges compound over the years and can eat into your equity significantly, which can leave little to pay for care in later life or to pass on to children.\n\nFor example, on an average rate of 4.91 per cent, over a 20-year period a \u00a330,000 equity release loan can compound into a debt of \u00a379,933 - add 10 years to that, and you will owe the provider \u00a3130,476.\n\nAs Andrew explains above, most equity release loans now carry a no negative equity guarantee, meaning the borrower will never owe more than the value of their home.\n\nCheck that the provider is a registered member of the Equity Release Council to ensure that this applies.\n\nOften downsizing achieves the same goal as equity release while protecting your inheritance\n\nAs Andrew also mentioned, using a drawdown facility means you will only pay interest on what you've taken out.\n\nSpeaking to an adviser will help with the sums, but it also pays to do as much research yourself as you can.\n\nIf you're looking to boost your retirement income, often downsizing can be a preferable alternative to equity release. This way you get a lump sum, but also lower your monthly outgoings. On top of this, your inheritance is protected.\n\nYou can read our comprehensive guide to equity release by clicking here.\n\nYou can also use our compound interest calculator to see how much you could end up owing. The calculator is designed to calculate savings interest, but can also be used to calculate the interest on a loan.\n\nTo use the calculator, if you're considering taking a lump sum, just use the 'lump sum' option, while 'monthly saving' can be used to calculate how much you would owe if they withdrew monthly with a drawdown plan.", "description": "My husband and I are retiring next year and we don't think that between us, our pensions will provide us with enough income to keep up with our lifestyle.
