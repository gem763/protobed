It has extended loans worth billions of dollars to build railways, roads and power plants, mainly using Chinese workers.\n\nRussia, which has strong ties with some of the countries in the region, openly opposes North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union enlargement to the six Western Balkan states.\n\n\"[The] hearts and minds of North Macedonia citizens should guide [the] country forward, not Russian bots and trolls on social media,\" Pompeo said. \"You've contributed troops to fight alongside ours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. You have contributed to the coalition which has defeated the ISIS caliphate.\"\n\n\"I am confident that the United States Senate will ratify your accession protocol this fall, so that we can formally fold you into the NATO team,\" he added.\n\n'For the world'\n\nNorth Macedonia's attempts to integrate with Western institutions were hampered until it agreed with its neighbour Greece last year on its new name.\n\nGreece had long insisted that \"Macedonia\" - the name the country chose after the breakup of Yugoslavia - implied a territorial claim on the Greek region of that name.\n\nFlying in from Rome, Pompeo became the most senior US official to visit Montenegro since 2017 when that country joined NATO. He is also the most senior US official to visit North Macedonia since 2001.\n\n\"The United States will continue to partner with you for the good of your citizens, for the region, and for the world,\" he said.\n\nPompeo said the US was about to finalise a deal for \"$36 million worth of light tactical vehicles\" for Montenegro.\n\nHe commended intelligence cooperation with Montenegro, through which he said the US has \"been able to develop a patch against the latest Russian malware that now protects millions of devices worldwide\".\n\n\"It is of strategic importance for Montenegro to have US and EU presence in the Balkans so there would be no space for [influence] of those countries who do not share [the] same values,\" Montenegro Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said.\n\nPompeo's trip to southern Europe has been overshadowed by an impeachment inquiry in the US against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe top US diplomat has yet to comment on evidence presented in the probe on Thursday, when it was revealed that the former US special representative for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, thought it was \"crazy\" to withhold military aid from Kiev as it confronted a threat from Russia.\n\nAt the start of a meeting with Montenegrin officials, Pompeo did not respond to a journalist's question on whether he thought Volker had acted appropriately in the case.", "description": "Visiting southeastern Europe, US secretary of state warns leaders over Beijing's conditional infrastructure investments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/411240bfb618436e90a56acb475ff71e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
