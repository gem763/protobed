I think it\u2019s important that we establish right here, right now that the liberal values of Stanford University, Western values, are the ones that should win.\u201d\n\nSchmidt has previously been critical of the Trump administration, telling Google employees in 2017 that the administration would do \u201cevil things.\u201d Breitbart News has previously reported that emails between Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook show that Schmidt met with Podesta and was interested in assuming the role of \u201chead outside advisor\u201d to the campaign.\n\n\u201cI met with Eric Schmidt tonight,\u201d wrote Podesta. \u201cAs David reported, he\u2019s ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc. He was more deferential on structure than I expected. Wasn\u2019t pushing to run through one of his existing firms. Clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to push others out.\u201d\n\nPodesta further pushes Mook to meet with Schmidt, writing, \u201cHe\u2019s still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon. I think it\u2019s worth doing. You around? If you are, and want to meet with him, maybe the four of us can get on the phone in the am. \u201c\n\nPodesta outlined what he and Schmidt discussed, writing, \u201cThe thing [Schmidt] really pressed me hard on was geography. Very committed to the idea that this be done in a city where young coders would want to be, preferably outer borough NYC. Thought No Cal was priced out of the market and too into itself. Thought DC lacked talent in this arena.\u201d\n\nGoogle as a company has also been accused of working with the Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed that Google as a company was \u201cdirectly engaged\u201d in the campaign. Specifically, Assange claimed, \u201cThe chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, set up a company to run the digital component of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nEric Schmidt did, in fact, create a company in the last quarter of 2015 called The Groundwork whose website is empty except for a single placeholder logo. Breitbart has previously reported on The Groundwork and how it was reportedly developed to install Clinton in the Oval Office.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
