Which is important, because people are going to want to return to Earth. They\u2019re not going to want to leave Earth forever. They\u2019re also going to be able to go between\u2019\n\n\u2018We get to choose, do we want stasis and rationing, or do we want dynamism and growth?\u2019 Bezos asked during the invite-only event in Washington DC on May 9th.\n\n\u2018This is an easy choice. We know what, we want we just have to get busy.\n\n\u2018If we\u2019re out in the solar system, we can have a trillion humans in the solar system \u2013 which means we\u2019d have a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. This would be an incredible civilization.\u2019\n\nThe concept was first posited in the 1970s by Bezos\u2019 former professor O\u2019Neill, whose proposed habitats would rotate in space to create artificial gravity based on centrifugal force.\n\n\u2018These are very large structures, miles on end, and they hold a million people or more each,\u2019 Bezos said.\n\nThe habitats, reminiscent of the film Interstellar, could be built close enough to Earth to allow people to travel back and forth, and house \u2018a million people or more each.\u2019 And, according to Bezos, they\u2019d have the \u2018ideal climate\u2019 at all times, \u2018like Maui on its best day, all year long\u2019\n\nThese cities may replicate cities on Earth, such as that pictured above, or start from scratch with their own futuristic architecture, Bezos noted. And, there would no rain, no storms, no earthquakes\n\nThe concept was first posited in the 1970s by Bezos\u2019 former professor O\u2019Neill, whose proposed habitats would rotate in space to create artificial gravity based on centrifugal force. Blue Origins' take on the design was on display at the secretive event\n\n\u2018Some of them would be more recreational \u2013 they don\u2019t all have to have the same gravity \u2013 they can have a recreational one that keeps it zero-g so you can go flying with your own wings.\u2019\n\nThey may replicate cities on Earth or start from scratch with their own futuristic architecture, Bezos noted.\n\nAnd, there would be 'no rain, no storms, no earthquakes.'\n\n\u2018These are beautiful, people are going to want to live here,\u2019 Bezos said.\n\n\u2018And they can be close to Earth so that you can return. Which is important, because people are going to want to return to Earth. They\u2019re not going to want to leave Earth forever. They\u2019re also going to be able to go between.\u2019\n\nAccording to Bezos, traveling between different space colonies would be as simple as \u2018a day trip.\u2019\n\nBut, we still have a long way to go before the vision can become a reality.\n\n\u2018This is going to take a long time, this is a big vision,\u2019 Bezos said. \u2018The price of admission to do interesting things in space right now is just too high.\u2019\n\nBuilding off of a concept introduced decades ago by physicist Gerard O'Neill \u2013 who Bezos himself studied under during his time at Princeton \u2013 the Blue Origin founder (left) outlined self-sustaining habitats that could hold entire cities, agricultural areas, and even national parks in space\n\nAccording to Bezos, a trip between different space colonies would be as simple as \u2018a day trip.\u2019 But, we still have a long way to go before the vision can become a reality. \u2018This is going to take a long time, this is a big vision,\u2019 Bezos said. \u2018The price of admission to do interesting things in space right now is just too high\u2019\n\nWhile the event started off with the elaborate concept images of self-sustaining space habitats, the real star of the talk turned out to be something much closer to home \u2013 the moon.\n\nOn stage, Bezos took the wraps off a massive model of what will be the firm\u2019s first lunar lander, dubbed Blue Moon.\n\n\u2018This is an incredible vehicle, and it\u2019s going to the moon,\u2019 Bezos said, according to CNN, which live-blogged the event.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the lander has been in development for the last three years and is on track for a 2024 crewed moon landing \u2013 falling in line with the five-year deadline revealed earlier this year by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe plan could ultimately serve as a stepping stone for colonization of the moon and deeper space targets, Bezos suggested.", "description": "Building off of a concept introduced by physicist Gerard O'Neill \u2013 who Bezos himself studied under during his time at Princeton \u2013 the Blue Origin founder outlined  habitats that could hold cities.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/13/22/13454822-0-image-a-2_1557781473821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-13"}
