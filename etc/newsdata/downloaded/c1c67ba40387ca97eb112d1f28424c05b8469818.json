Minutes later, German police arrested a Russian man attempting to leave the scene on an electric scooter after he discarded a pistol and silencer.\n\nThe murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili is the latest in a flurry of assassinations of Kremlin antagonists or attacks on them.\n\nLast year, Western governments expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning in the U.K. of a former Russian spy and his daughter, which London has blamed on the Russian military foreign-intelligence service GRU. The two survived exposure to the Russian nerve agent novichok.\n\nThe assertion by U.S. officials marks the first time the U.S. linked Russia to the slaying. German officials initially said the killing might be related to organized crime. Authorities in at least three countries\u2014Germany, Poland and France\u2014are now investigating.\n\n\u201cThe United States believes that Russia is responsible for this assassination,\u201d a U.S. official said.\n\nGerman police released this image of the suspected killer, who has not been identified. Photo: Berlin State Police\n\nGerman authorities haven\u2019t commented further about the attack and the man in custody, despite speculation that the killing might have been politically motivated. The Kremlin hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment. It has denied any involvement in Mr. Khangoshvili\u2019s death.\n\nU.S. officials declined to say which government officials or organizations in Russia they believe to have been involved in the alleged plot to kill Mr. Khangoshvili.\n\nThe Kremlin has emphatically denied any involvement in killings overseas even though Russia formally legalized the practice in 2006. Since then several Kremlin opponents have died in attacks in the Middle East, Turkey and in Ukraine. Attacks in Europe have been rarer.\n\nThe absence of a German government reaction to Mr. Khangoshvili\u2019s murder has sparked criticism from opposition parties that Berlin is eager to avoid a confrontation with Russia. A spokesman for the German government declined to comment and said the investigation was continuing.\n\nThe Berlin prosecutor\u2019s office, which is leading the investigation, declined to comment. But in a sign of the mounting suspicions, U.S. officials and a German official familiar with the case said Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service, the BND, has now joined the probe. The BND didn\u2019t respond to a written request for comment.\n\nOne official said the suspect had recently come out of Russian prison after serving a murder sentence. Upon his release, he was given a bona fide Russian passport under the name Vadim Sokolov, which U.S. officials believed to be a cover. Within days, he used the document to apply at the French Embassy in Moscow for a special visa allowing holders to travel freely through Europe\u2019s Schengen document-free travel bloc.\n\n\u201cA fake identity with a real passport can only be provided by authorities in Russia,\u201d one U.S. official said.\n\nThe suspect then flew to Paris and from there traveled to Warsaw, where he stayed for several days before traveling on to Berlin, the U.S. official said. He rented out a room at a Warsaw hotel and left his luggage there when he departed for Berlin, with the intention of returning, a Polish government official said.\n\nGerman police released this image of the bicycle they say the accused killer used to approach Mr. Khangoshvili and shoot him twice in the head. Photo: Berlin State Police\n\nIn Berlin, the suspect, whose real identity remains unknown to investigators, is thought to have been briefed by accomplices about the daily routine of Mr. Khangoshvili. Around midday on Friday, Aug. 23, investigators said, the suspected killer confronted the Chechen \u00e9migr\u00e9 in a park in central Berlin as Mr. Khangoshvili was on his way to the mosque where he regularly worshiped.\n\nThe suspect rode to the victim using a bicycle that officials said had been placed near the scene before the shooting. He sped toward Mr. Khangoshvili and shot him twice in the head with a Glock 26 handgun fitted with a silencer in full view of passersby, the people familiar with the probe alleged.\n\nThe suspected assassin then hid in a bush, changed his clothes and disposed of the gun and the bicycle in the Spree River near the park where the murder took place, according to police. Witnesses called the police, who arrested the suspect as he was about to flee on the scooter, police said.\n\nGerman police are now investigating who procured the bicycle and the scooter. The suspect was intending to travel back to Poland after the killing, officials said.\n\nGerman police released this image of the scooter they say the alleged killer used to try to flee the scene. Photo: Berlin State Police\n\nPolice are likely to run into uncertainties in determining who, precisely, the gunman was working for inside Russia.\n\nWestern officials said that Russian assassinations outside its borders have traditionally been directed either by the federal government in Moscow or by Chechnya\u2019s pro-Kremlin leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, who commands a security apparatus of ethnic Chechens.\n\nThe people familiar with the investigation said there is another possibility\u2014namely, that the murder was ordered by Chechnya, not Moscow, but still executed with the help of Russian operatives who fitted the assassin with a fake identity and new passport.\n\nFriends of Mr. Khangoshvili said he had for years dodged attempted assassinations and that his death in Berlin capped a career of fighting Moscow, first as a field commander and eventually as a hunted refugee.\n\nA confidant of Chechnya\u2019s former president, Aslan Maskhadov, said Mr. Khangoshvili distinguished himself as a midlevel commander in the breakaway region\u2019s second war against Russia in the early 2000s.\n\nOne acquaintance said he likely aroused the hatred of Russia\u2019s security services for his role in a raid on the Russian city of Nazran in 2004 in which dozens of security service officers died.\n\nAfter rebel resistance was crushed inside Russia, Mr. Khangoshvili fled with others to the neighboring state of Georgia, where for several years he was employed informally by the Georgian government, specializing in counterintelligence against the Russians. There, he narrowly escaped a kidnap attempt and an ambush in which his car was riddled with bullets.\n\nHe left Georgia in 2015, hoping to find work in Ukraine, which was fighting its own war against Russia, but in Kiev he failed to find a job with the Ukraine\u2019s premier security service, the SBU. Amid a spate of assassinations, he feared for his safety and left with his wife for Germany.\n\nIn Germany, Mr. Khangoshvili applied for refugee status, but was refused repeated requests for special protection from the German government, said Givi Targamadze, a former official in the Georgian government who kept in touch with him until recently.\n\nAt the time of his death, Mr. Khangoshvili was still trying to obtain state-appointed bodyguards through the German court system, Mr. Targamadze said. \u201cHe felt that even though he wasn\u2019t able to get the protection he asked for, he felt relatively safe in Germany,\u201d Mr. Targamadze said. \u201cApparently he wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2014Thomas Grove in Moscow contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com, Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.com and Michael R.
