How long you are on it is a different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.\u201d\n\nAfter infighting within the party over the course to take on impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi officially launched an impeachment inquiry last week.\n\nShe tasked six of her committee chairs to work under an \u201cumbrella approach\u201d to investigate the president, with the main priority for Democrats right now being the incident involving Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the current Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son, Hunter.\n\nMost recent counts have more than 200 Democrats in favor of at least starting the inquiry, although they would need at least 218 willing to actually impeach the president to move it through their chamber.\n\nShould the House pass articles of impeachment, the Republican-held Senate would have to hold a trial and vote to effectively impeach Mr. Trump.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
