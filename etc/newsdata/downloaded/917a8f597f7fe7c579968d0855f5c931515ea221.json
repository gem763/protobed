If front-runner Joseph R. Biden drops out of the race, the chances increase he says. A lot. Mr. Morris told all of this to talk radio host John Catsimatidis a mere 48 hours ago.\n\n\u201cWill Hillary run again? She could triumph over a weak and divided field, but many Democrats are terrified to see her as the face of their party again. The Ghost of Hillary Past is threatening to become the Ghost of Hillary Present for Democrats,\u201d writes National Review columnist John Fund.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much for Hillary to think of herself as the best contender for the nomination. Her team is privately dismissive of the Democratic field,\u201d Mr. Fund continues, revealing that a source familiar with the situation acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton actually could win the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cIn a divided field she could raise huge bucks, rally older feminist voters, and win like Trump did over a divided field based on sky-high name ID,\u201d the source said.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of Clinton entering the 2020 race is virtually zero. Which means that her comments are probably intended to do exactly as advertised: keep her name in the news cycle in hopes it\u2019ll help her sell more books,\u201d counters Vanity Fair columnist Eric Lutz \u2014 citing \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women,\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s latest book which was published Oct. 1 and now ranked at No. 200 on Amazon.\n\nMr. Lutz also wonders about Philippe Reines \u2014 who advised Mrs. Clinton for a decade and recently told Fox News that she was seriously mulling a run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less clear why someone like Reines would float the idea of a 2020 bid; maybe he legitimately thinks Clinton is the 2020 savior Democrats need. Maybe he\u2019s simply trolling, playing on Republicans\u2019 most gleeful hopes on the party\u2019s favorite TV station. It\u2019s true that, according to multiple reports, Democrats \u2014 and especially those in the establishment wing of the party \u2014 are starting to worry. It is probably not true that Clinton will appear to save them, try as Fox might to summon her,\u201d Mr. Lutz concludes.\n\nJOURNALISTS IN THE BIG CITY BUBBLE\n\nThose pronounced characteristics and beliefs evident in many members of the press could be a result of their living circumstances. No, really. A sizable number of them live in big city bubbles, far from heartland America.\n\n\u201cNew York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., are the financial, entertainment and political capitals of the United States \u2014 and that may help explain why they are home to a disproportionately large share of the nation\u2019s newsroom employees. About one-in-five newsroom employees (22%) live in these three metro areas, which, by comparison, are home to 13% of all U.S. workers,\u201d says a new Pew Research Center analysis of census data from 2013 to 2017.\n\n\u201cAmong the 10 largest U.S. metro areas by total population, only New York and Washington are home to larger shares of the nation\u2019s newsroom employees than of U.S. workers. Newsroom employees are about twice as likely as workers overall to live in New York (12% vs. 7%) and Washington (5% vs. 2%). Los Angeles has about the same share of each (5% of the nation\u2019s newsroom employees vs. 4% of all U.S. workers),\u201d the pollsters says.\n\n\u201cThe remaining seven metro areas \u2014 Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia and Houston \u2014 each have between 1% and 3% of both newsroom employees and U.S. workers overall. These 10 areas combined account for about 35% of all newsroom employees in the U.S., but about 28% of workers overall.\u201d\n\nTHOSE YOUNG SOCIALISTS\n\nYet another poll confirms that young Americans remain charmed by the idea of socialism \u2014 and even communism.\n\n\u201cLabor camps, ecological ruin, shortages of everything from aspirin to toilet paper, and the ever-present risk of that midnight knock on the door \u2014 what\u2019s not to love about communism? At least, that\u2019s what one out of three millennials must think, according to a new survey conducted by Victims of Communism and YouGov,\u201d writes PJ Media columnist Stephen Green.\n\n\u201cBut it gets better, er, worse. Not only did 30% of the 23-38 age cohort have a \u2018favorable\u2019 view of communism, 70% said they\u2019d be happy to vote for socialism,\u201d Mr. Green says.\n\n\u201cThe press, the universities, and even the dominant popular culture have all been co-opted by the progressive left, after a decades-long march through the institutions. So if you\u2019ve been taught that your victimhood group has rights superior to your own \u2014 if you\u2019ve been told your whole life that economic progress is killing the planet, if you believe in your heart that needs and wants trump economic reality \u2014 well, then what\u2019s wrong with a little communism?\u201d asks Mr. Green.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been taught this; no wonder they believe it. Or as Lenin also said, \u2018Give me your four-year-olds, and in a generation I will build a socialist state,\u2019\u201d he concludes.\n\nHOAXUS POCUS\n\nThe mirth and muscle of President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign continues with a new line of items featuring the theme \u201cStop the Witch Hunt,\u201d reflecting Democratic obsession with impeaching Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cHoaxus pocus. The greatest witch hunt in the history of the USA continues. The only people scared this Halloween are Shifty Schiff, Nervous Nancy and Democrat Hack Jerry Nadler about their chances in 2020,\u201d the campaign notes, referring to House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler \u2014 all depicted in caricature confronting a crystal ball.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats continue their bogus witch hunt of President Trump because they still can\u2019t accept the results of the 2016 election,\u201d says campaign manager Brad Parscale. \u201cThe President will continue delivering for the American people as he promised them in 2016, and there is no stopping him.\u201d\n\nFind the T-shirt and other goodies at Shop.DonaldJTrump.com.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 13% of Americans say all their friends have political views similar to their own.\n\n\u2022 37% of Americans say most have politically similar views.\n\n\u2022 19% say half their friends have similar views, half don\u2019t.\n\n\u2022 9% say a few friends have similar views.\n\n\u2022 3% say none of their friends have similar political views.\n\n\u2022 19% don\u2019t know what their friends political views are, and couldn\u2019t comment.\n\nSource: A YouGov poll of 16,647 U.S. adults conducted Oct. 21.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
