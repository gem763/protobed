Our world is one of green forests, blue skies and glowing orange sunsets \u2014 but all those beautiful, vibrant shades are an illusion. Living Colour, a documentary from The Nature of Things, delves into our vivid vision to uncover the secrets of colour. Here are a few things we learn in the film.\n\nColour is an illusion, not part of the real world\n\nWe think of colour as being a fundamental property of objects in life: green trees, blue sky, red apples. But that\u2019s not how it works.\n\n\u201cWhat colour is not is part of our world,\u201d says neuroscientist Beau Lotto. \u201cEvery colour that people see is actually inside their head \u2026 and the stimulus of colour, of course, is light.\u201d\n\nAs light pours down on us from the sun, or from a lightbulb in our home, objects and surfaces absorb some wavelengths of light and reflect others. \u201cThe ones that are reflected then land onto our retina,\u201d says Lotto. There, those reflected wavelengths are transformed into electrical signals to be interpreted by our brain.\n\nSo we don\u2019t really \u201csee\u201d colour, but reflected light, as interpreted in our brain. \u201cIt\u2019s a useful perception of our world, but it\u2019s not an accurate perception of our world,\u201d says Lotto.\n\nWe can see about a million different colours\n\nMost humans are trichromats, which means our eyes have three different types of cone cells: red, green or blue, able to detect about 100 shades each. In combination, our cones allow us to see about a million different colours.\n\nAmong mammals, it\u2019s mainly humans, apes and Old World monkeys that have three cone types. Most other mammals are dichromats, meaning they only have two types of cones and are only able to see 10,000 combinations.\n\nOne evolutionary theory to account for our great colour vision comes down to communication, according to Mark Changizi, a cognitive scientist.\n\nNon-human primates that have trichromatic colour vision like us also tend to have bare skin on their faces and backsides. When this skin flushes, it can signal things such as ovulation, and trichromatic colour vision helps potential mates see this. Humans, as the \u201cnaked ape,\u201d similarly use our colour vision to understand the health status of others.\n\nWith so much bare skin, we can see a range of blushing and blanching. If another person blushes with too much colour or looks \u201cwhite as a sheet,\u201d we can see these involuntary cues and know about their true health or physical status. \u201cThis is how you \u2018see\u2019 the health of your child, for example,\u201d says Changizi.\n\n\u201cI can lie about being angry or sad, but you can\u2019t lie about being oxygenated \u2026 That\u2019s what\u2019s called an honest signal. You can\u2019t fake it.\u201d\n\nWe may have early bacteria to thank for our colour vision\n\nProfessor Jay Neitz, a colour vision researcher at the University of Washington, notes that the key to colour vision \u2014 our eye\u2019s photoreceptors \u2014 didn\u2019t spring up overnight. In fact, the first \u201ceyes\u201d to evolve on our planet were rudimentary at best.\n\nBefore there were any fish or invertebrates swimming in the seas, the ancestors of bacteria were floating in the currents. Those archaebacteria absorbed energy from the sun, just as plants do today. But back then, the sun\u2019s UV rays were very damaging.\n\nThese single-celled early earthlings responded to blue-yellow light, which kept them out of harm\u2019s way. They would migrate away from the intense sunlight of the day and rise up toward the sea\u2019s surface with the orange light of dusk and dawn, when they could absorb energy more safely.\n\nMillions of years later, the slimy eel-like hagfish evolved with a primitive eye that also detects blue-yellow light, controlling their daily rhythms. It\u2019s possible, Neitz notes, that more complex eyes and cone cells slowly developed from these early versions, letting us see the world in vibrant Technicolor.\n\nOur memories may affect how we see colours\n\nAnya Hurlbert of Newcastle University is investigating how our experiences and memories may impact the way we perceive the colour of objects. In particular, she\u2019s interested in a phenomenon called colour constancy.\n\n\u201cColour constancy is what the brain does to compensate for different colours of \u2026 light shining on objects,\u201d says Hurlbert. \u201cWhen the light shining on objects changes,\u201d from blue to white, for example, \u201cthe light reflected from the objects changes.\u201d\n\nConsider holding a ripe banana in your kitchen \u2014 it undoubtedly looks yellow. If you take that banana outside and look at it under very different lighting conditions, it will still look yellow. \u201cThe brain adjusts for this difference in order to keep the object looking the same colour,\u201d Hurlbert says. The typical banana shape may even be the key to seeing it as yellow, as Hurlbert explains during a striking demonstration in Living Colour. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty powerful perceptual effect.\u201d\n\nIn other words, our brain sometimes jumps to conclusions when it comes to colour and maintaining our perception of the world.\n\nOur words may affect how we see colours\n\nThe way you differentiate between colours may depend on the language you speak.\n\nCognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky, a professor at the University of California San Diego, has studied how language allows us to discriminate between different hues. \u201cLanguages divide up the colour spectrum in lots of different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cSome languages have lots of words for colours; some languages have only a couple of words.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the Russian language has two different words for what English speakers would call blue: one for light shades and the other for dark shades. \u201c[My team and I] wondered if Russian speakers are getting a lifetime of practice dividing blue into light ... and dark. Are they actually getting better at distinguishing between different shades of blue?\u201d Boroditsky says, who conducted a study to find out.\n\nAs it turns out, native Russian speakers were faster at identifying those different shades when compared to native English speakers.\n\n\u201cWhat a lot of these studies are showing us is that language and culture and experience actually trains the very nuts and bolts of perception,\u201d says Boroditsky. \u201cIt changes even what colour you see when you look out in the world.\u201d\n\nMORE:\n\nMeet three people who may see the world completely differently than you do\n\nVantablack: One of the darkest materials ever made\n\nThe mantis shrimp \u2014 a colour vision superstar?\n\nIn the contest of colour vision equipment, the mantis shrimp takes the top prize. It has perhaps the most extraordinary eyes in the animal kingdom.\n\n\u201cThey have, in many ways, the most unusual eyes we\u2019ve ever discovered,\u201d says Tom Cronin, a biologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who studies the plucky little crustaceans. They have about 12 primary colour receptors (compared to our three) and can even detect two types of polarized light. But strangely, the shrimp does not ace colour discrimination tests.\n\nThe mantis shrimp\u2019s biological need for such incredible colour vision hasn\u2019t been fully determined. \u201cThey may well have this super colour vision for some super task that we haven\u2019t discovered yet,\u201d says Cronin.\n\nShrimp-inspired cameras are now being tested for a number of different applications, from detecting cancer cells to helping self-driving cars \u201csee\u201d in dangerous conditions.\n\nWatch Living Colour on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/LivingColour_ColourRoundup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
