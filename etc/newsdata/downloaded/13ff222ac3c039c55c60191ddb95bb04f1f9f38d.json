Earlier this month, Waterville Mayor Nick Isgro balked at the change and issued a formal proclamation to keep \u201cColumbus Day,\u201d calling the late explorer a \u201cpioneer,\u201d News Center Maine reported.\n\nThe University of Maine College Republicans thanked the mayor in a Facebook post on Oct. 4, writing that the societies conquered by Columbus \u201cwere corrupted by rampant ritual sacrifice and cannibalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Nick Isgro, for standing up to the Radical Left-Wing agenda that is being pushed by Establishment Republicans in Augusta with the help of the Left,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThe most successful tactic of Communists is rewriting history and destroying our heritage. We must not forget the brutal societies that Christopher Columbus and other explorers discovered in America. These societies were corrupted by rampant ritual sacrifice and cannibalism.\u201d\n\nUniversity President Joan Ferrini-Mundy and Vice President of Student Life Robert Dana responded to the message by sending out a campuswide email on Oct. 7, saying the group was spreading \u201c15th-century Spanish war propaganda to dehumanize indigenous peoples\u201d and that their message was neither \u201csupported by nor reflective of\u201d the school\u2019s \u201cvalues and principles of inclusivity and equity,\u201d Campus Reform reported.\n\nThe conservative group later responded to the email on Facebook, saying the administration had put their members in danger and demanding a formal apology from the university.\n\n\u201cIf ANY of our members are attacked, bullied, or intimated as a result of his actions, we will hold him personally responsible,\u201d the group wrote.\n\nMr. Dana later told News Center Maine that the school supports free speech.\n\n\u201cThe University felt that because our name was implicated in the post, of course, we had to express our value structure \u2014 what we believe in, what we\u2019re doing here at UMaine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe support every student\u2019s right to free speech and to meandering through the marketplace of ideas.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
