At an August breakfast in Manhattan\u2019s West Village, Rudd was as charming as advertised. Clad inconspicuously in a baseball cap, T-shirt and shorts, still sporting his summer vacation beard, he was conscious of his celebrity without indulging in it, as when he spoke credibly about taking the subway like a civilian. (\u201cIf I talk to somebody, they\u2019re like, \u2018Why are you riding the subway?\u2019 Because I need to get somewhere!\u201d)\n\nBut \u201cLiving With Yourself\u201d also allows Rudd to find the humor and the humanity in the old, original Miles: a man who was already struggling to fulfill his modest ambitions and must now contend with an unwanted doppelg\u00e4nger, whose very existence creates standards he can\u2019t live up to.\n\nThe truth is, there is a certain amount of the old Miles in Rudd, too : The actor knows how it feels to want the same seemingly fundamental things as everyone else \u2014 and to be misapprehended in those pursuits. He wants to feel that he is good at what he does and is expressing himself through it, but he also wants to hold on to a sense of commonality and privacy that he sometimes feels is slipping away.\n\nWhen it comes to his work, Rudd said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any sort of grand statement to make, to anybody. I don\u2019t want people to know that much about me, really. I don\u2019t have much of an interest in being an open book.\u201d", "description": "The star of \u201cAnt-Man\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d confronts himself, quite literally, playing both an imperfect man and his perfect clone in \u201cLiving With Yourself.\u201d", "authors": ["Dave Itzkoff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/arts/13rudd1/13rudd1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
