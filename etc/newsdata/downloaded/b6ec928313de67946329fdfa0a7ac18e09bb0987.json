It reports that White House officials understood Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior to be improper and tried to conceal the wrongdoing. And we learn that the Justice Department has been more deeply involved in the affair than it had previously acknowledged.\n\nRead the whistleblower complaint regarding President Trump\u2019s communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nThe complaint significantly bolsters the case that the quid pro quo of the July 25 phone call was a promise by Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden in exchange for an invitation to meet Mr. Trump at the White House. As we previously wrote, obtaining a meeting with Mr. Trump was a top priority for Mr. Zelensky, a neophyte politician, following his inauguration in May. He needed to show that he had U.S. support as Ukraine faced continuing military and political pressure from Russia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, \u201cMultiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on the issues that had been publicly aired\u201d by Mr. Giuliani and one of his Ukraine allies, a corrupt former prosecutor who had fed him false stories about Mr. Biden and the disclosure of illegal payments to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager.\n\nThe whistleblower also says Mr. Trump downgraded the delegation to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, ordering Vice President Pence not to attend, and \u201cmade clear\u201d to U.S. officials that Mr. Trump \u201cdid not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy \u2018chose to act\u2019 in office.\u201d\n\nThe rough transcript of the July 25 call clearly shows what this pressure produced. Mr. Zelensky raises the subject of a visit to the United States, then reiterates that \u201cwe will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation.\u201d Mr. Trump responds: \u201cGood. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General [William] Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuid. Pro. Quo.\n\nAs the whistleblower describes it, White House and State Department officials did their best to hide or smooth over Mr. Trump\u2019s improper behavior. They placed the rough transcript of the call into a computer system \u201creserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action.\u201d Apparently other such transcripts have been similarly \u2014 and improperly \u2014 stashed there. Meanwhile, State\u2019s envoys met with Mr. Zelensky and advised him on \u201chow to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made.\u201d\n\nMr. Barr denies that he played any role in this affair. But Justice now acknowledges that it advised intelligence officials not to forward the whistleblower memo to Congress even though Mr. Barr is mentioned in it and material from Ukraine \u2014 evidently solicited by Mr. Giuliani \u2014 is being reviewed by John Durham, the U.S. attorney Mr. Barr appointed to investigate the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn short, Mr. Trump\u2019s abuse of power had a host of enablers. Congress should hold them all to account.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump tries to force Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election\n\nGreg Sargent: The big, alarming question about Trump hovering over today\u2019s hearing\n\nJennifer Rubin: The \u2018perfect\u2019 call \u2014 and those dense enough to say so\n\nPaul Waldman: The acting director of national intelligence just showed how corrupt the Trump administration is\n\nHenry Olsen: The whistleblower complaint doesn\u2019t do Democrats any favors\n\nE.J.
