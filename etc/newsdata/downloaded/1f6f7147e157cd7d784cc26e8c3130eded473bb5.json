And in some regions, such as the Cape Town CBD, the nearest non-halaal stores are several kilometres away.\n\nAvailability of the burger in the city was a common complaint on social media.\n\nWhy are both Cape Town CBD still going to be halaal. can`t it be one is other not? \u2014 Edward Veerapen (@eveerapen) September 11, 2019\n\nFor others, the drive to the nearest Bacon King store was considerably further:\n\nSorry guys, but its not worth driving 35km. Quite disappointed actually. \u2014 jaime odendaal (@TheTinySalmon87) September 17, 2019\n\nHi thanks for losing very loyal customers where you didn't consider having stores that don't sell this near to each other. Literally have to travel 100km or more to my nearest store that doesn't sell. Pathetic \u2014 Mubz22 (@MubzD22) September 10, 2019\n\nStill, given the grand promises made by the Bacon King advertisements, we thought the drive could be worth it.\n\nBurger King describes the burger as one \u201csmothered with mayonnaise and ketchup, followed by three rashers of crispy bacon, and a layer of cheese on a 100% pure beef patty, and another layer of cheese with another 100% pure beef patty again, nestled between a fresh bun with sesame seeds.\u201d\n\nThis giant stack of meat and cheese doesn\u2019t come cheap, though. The hamburger on its own costs R69.90. Include a side of small chips and a drink, and you\u2019re in for a fast food meal that costs R89.90.\n\nThis prices it well above similar burgers at fast food competitors like Steers and McDonalds, and moves it closer to more premium options like those at RocoMamas.\n\n\n\nFor just R10 more, you can buy a full cheese and bacon burger at Spur, minus the soft drink.\n\nSo we made the drive \u2013 and wished we hadn't.\n\nBusiness Insider South Africa went looking for the new Bacon King burger in Cape Town in order to put it to the test. Our nearest branch, from the CBD, is at Blue Route Mall, 15 kilometres away.\n\nUpon arrival, the cashier commented that the Bacon King has been in high demand, with people requesting it even before its arrival earlier this month.\n\nEven so, most patrons we observed during our stay appeared to be sticking to the traditional Whopper, which is R20 cheaper than the new Bacon King.\n\nThe staff were chirpy, friendly, and fast, and our Bacon King meal arrived just five minutes after we\u2019d ordered. Although requested as an eat-in item, the burger was wrapped and bagged.\n\nIn spite of high expectations - set by the searing social media hype and the illuminated Bacon King picture above the cashiers head - our first impressions of the burger were disappointing.\n\nThe bouncy sesame-dotted bun, careful beef patty stack, oozing cheese, and glistening rashers of bacon promised on social media \u2013 and prominently on the restaurant menu \u2013 were nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead we found the bun flat and lacklustre, and almost dense and soggy to the touch.\n\nA quick check under the hood revealed the possible source of the bun issues. As the advertising copy points out, it really was \u201csmothered with mayonnaise and ketchup\u201d.\n\nSet in the sauce were two small, haphazardly-placed rashes of bacon, two large but otherwise typical Burger King style patties, and half a dozen slices of cheddar cheese layered between them.\n\nAlthough it would be unrealistic to expect a fast food burger to excel on presentation, or even to match its marketing image, at this price point it would be reasonable to expect a burger that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s been quite so hastily slapped together.\n\n\n\nAt the very least, given the burger\u2019s unambiguous name, the bacon could also have been made to look less like an afterthought.\n\nThe true test, though, was to come in the eating. And, unfortunately, this too was underwhelming.\n\nThe dense bun immediately compressed under the pressure of our fingers to patty level. And although the saucy, cheesy mixture was initially pleasant, it quickly became too much.\n\nThe burger was also far from hot, and felt possibly like it had been left on the shelf while staff finished off frying the admittedly perfectly cooked side of chips.\n\nThe expectations of \u201cthree rashers of crispy bacon\u201d were also quickly dashed. The bacon was scarce, especially given the size of the bun and patties, and it lacked any perceptible crispiness that might have elevated the burger slightly closer to its cult hero status.\n\nThe copious amount of cheese, mayonnaise and ketchup also meant that everything quickly blended together with the bread, and it was hard to actually taste the addition of the prized bacon.\n\nThe burger is unapologetically meaty, but without any other items in the mix to add some much-needed crunch, or at least a bit of texture to liven it up, it quickly became a fairly dull and limp burger.\n\nIn all, our tasting suggested that there was little more to this burger than a few patties, some sauce, and a few rashers of uninspired bacon.\n\nAlthough much of the social media commentary is based around availability and hype, some people have reported back on their own experiences, suggesting we aren't alone in our disappointment, though that is not the universal experience.\n\nSeveral people on Facebook and Twitter claimed that the burger met their expectations. Some have also posted pictures of burgers that appear similar to that received by Business Insider South Africa, claiming that their experience was less than satisfactory. And some who\u2019ve tried the Bacon King burger at international Burger King branches pointed out the local version is markedly different.\n\nI think Burger King's burgers are okay but you never serve up this much bacon and your bacon is NEVER crisp. \u2014 Niels (@greengrogardens) September 17, 2019\n\nIf this was a traditional fast food item at a reasonable price point, the Bacon King may have faired adequately.\n\nBut given the social media hype, driven by a national campaign sporting an image of a voluptuous burger brimming with delectably crispy bacon, it seems unlikely that this is one burger that\u2019ll live up to expectations. Instead, it seems more likely that loyal Burger King fans will resort to adding bacon to their Whoppers, rather than forking up for the Bacon King.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "After six years in operation, the arrival of bacon at Burger King South Africa was eagerly anticipated.
