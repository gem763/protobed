The president and his campaign publicly berated Minneapolis\u2019s mayor. But even then it was easy to see why a city would want Trump\u2019s team to pay in advance.\n\nAs the Minneapolis rally loomed, CNN went back to a number of cities that had been identified in June by the Center for Public Integrity as places with outstanding bills in to the Trump campaign. CNN found that there was at least $841,000 still outstanding. The total, though, is more than that: Dave Levinthal, who reported the initial tallies for the Center for Public Integrity, confirmed in an email to The Washington Post on Thursday that he had checked back with all the cities he had identified in July and that none had been paid as of his most recent outreach.\n\nAdding in the bill from Albuquerque, that brings the total outstanding bill to more than $1 million \u2014 $1,052,395.78, to be precise. El Paso, which hasn\u2019t been paid for costs from a February rally, added a late fee of about $99,000 earlier this year, bringing the total to $1,151,183.36. Add in the $530,000 that Minneapolis was originally seeking and the total nears $1.7 million.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Trump-Campaign-Has-Over-Million-Outstanding-Bills-American-Cities"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
