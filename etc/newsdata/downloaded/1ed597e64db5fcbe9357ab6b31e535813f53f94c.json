I love both countries, and I was building peace.\"\n\n- Gun rights advocate -\n\nStarting in 2013, Butina built a bridge to the United States through ties between her very small Russian gun rights group and the National Rifle Association, the powerful, Republican-aligned American firearms lobby.\n\nHer group hosted NRA leaders in Russia and she and her influential Moscow sponsor, Alexandr Torshin, attended NRA events and US political gatherings, where they met with influential Republicans.\n\nAttending a Trump rally in 2016, Butina was singled out to ask the future president a question about US-Russia relations.\n\nHer social media was full of pictures of her posing with various firearms, endearing her to US gun activists. She became the girlfriend of a mid-level Republican and NRA operative, Paul Erickson.\n\n- 'Not this evil person' -\n\nIn 2016, she enrolled in American University, but prosecutors said she was in regular contact with embassy personnel with intelligence ties.\n\nThey said that although she was not an employee of any of Moscow's spy services, she knowingly took part in an operation to \"spot and assess\" potential US espionage targets.\n\n\"There is no doubt that she was not simply a graduate student,\" Assistant US Attorney Erik Kenerson told the court.\n\nShe denied it, but ultimately agreed to plead guilty to the charges of being an unregistered foreign agent.\n\n\"I humbly request forgiveness. I'm not this evil person depicted in the media,\" she told the court before being sentenced.", "description": "Maria Butina, the red-headed gun advocate from Russian who built a network of high-level Republican contacts before being arrested for spying, is expected to return to her country after her Friday release from a Florida prison.
