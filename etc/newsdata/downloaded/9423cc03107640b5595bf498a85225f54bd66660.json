Chicago's street grid corresponds almost exactly with the directional points of the compass.\n\nIt happens in other cities with gridded streets, too \u2014 Manhattanhenge, for example \u2014 but Chicago is unique in that the phenomenon takes place every year on the spring and fall equinoxes.\n\nWith perfect early fall weather of partly cloudy skies and temperatures in the 60s, I timed my departure from NPR's Chicago bureau on Michigan Avenue at about 6:20 p.m. CT and walked east up an incline on Randolph Street, across from the north end of Millennium Park.\n\nSeveral dozen amateur (and maybe professional) photographers had already set themselves up on prime real estate in the road's median, on curbs and along a railing on an overpass above where the street separates into upper and lower levels.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Schaper/NPR David Schaper/NPR\n\nBut others, myself included, just dodged taxicabs, buses and Ubers and stepped into the bike line or the street to capture the spectacular moment. It's one of the rare instances I've experienced when hurried city drivers didn't seem to mind stopping for the many people moving in and out of traffic as they stared into a blinding orange glare.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Schaper/NPR David Schaper/NPR\n\nIn the same way our Washington, D.C., colleagues attach the word \"gate\" to designate the scandal du jour, Chicagohenge gets its name from Stonehenge, the monument of massive rocks in England that scientists believe was erected more than 4,000 years ago. On certain dates, the rising and setting sun lines up with the stones, leading some to suggest that Stonehenge could have been built by early astronomers.\n\nThe next date to catch Chicagohenge is when the weather is almost certain to be less enjoyable: March 19, 2020.", "description": "Twice a year, on the fall and spring equinoxes, the sun sets perfectly framed by Chicago's skyscrapers.
