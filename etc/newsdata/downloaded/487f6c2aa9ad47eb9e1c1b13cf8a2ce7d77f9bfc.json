The group of 52 soldiers came from a southern French unit of the male-only force which is made up of largely foreign recruits.\n\nIn the final stages of preparation before being sent to French operations in west Africa, the men were ordered to enter a difficult area of mountainside in Valfr\u00e9jus, Savoie, with sealskins, skis and rescue equipment. The exposed, uneven mountainside, at an altitude of 2,600 metres (8,530ft), was treacherous and weather conditions were risky.\n\nAt about 1pm there was what was described as a terrible cracking sound and a cry of \u201cAvalanche!\u201d. Six soldiers died: an Albanian, a Hungarian, a Nepalese, a Moldovan, an Italian and a Madagascan who had taken French nationality. Seven others were wounded.\n\nThe investigation found an expedition on that mountainside required extreme vigilance and knowledge on the ground. The trial, which begins on Thursday, will examine whether the officers failed to consult local mountain experts, gendarmes and weather forecasters.\n\nJean-Michel Quillardet, a lawyer for a Ukrainian soldier who was injured, said the men were pushed to their limit and continued the mission because they did not want to let their captain down. He noted that the most senior members of the hierarchy were not on the march but instead involved in administrative tasks that day.\n\n\u201cThe investigation dossier is very clear: there was a risk of avalanche,\u201d Quillardet told France Inter radio. \u201cFirst, the soldiers who decided on the exercise didn\u2019t make contact with weather services or ski slope agents to at least inform themselves whether there was a danger or not. Second, during the march [on the mountain], there were witnesses who said they were \u2018going through hell\u2019. I will plead that, for these legionnaires, a lot from other countries, it was \u2018march or die\u2019. This is a concept of military command that seems absurd in the 21st century: officers lacked humanity.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for the accused officers denied they had been imprudent, arguing that the avalanche was not their fault.\n\nIn 2015, four former French Foreign Legion soldiers were given suspended prison sentences for violence against a fellow recruit who died from heatstroke during an exercise in one of the legion\u2019s toughest desert training camps, in Djibouti. In 38C (100.4F) midday heat, the recruit\u2019s water was taken from him, poured out and a soldier ordered that no more should be given to him. Punches followed and eventually, after begging \u201cwater, water\u201d, the recruit collapsed. The soldiers were expelled from the force after the incident, which was described by the legion as \u201cmonstrous\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\nThe French Foreign Legion \u2014 which once conjured up images of white kepis, brutal tests and men on the run from the law, thanks to films such as Beau Geste, starring Gary Cooper \u2014 is now a streamlined elite force which is engaged in many of France\u2019s most important military operations.", "description": "Four officers face manslaughter trial after six recruits died on gruelling training exercise", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/437f4d803c93d9cd9a725b9fc32dba64b3639199/177_101_1884_1130/master/1884.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7274eb1c42bca2bd9c3c78f5f109d95", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
