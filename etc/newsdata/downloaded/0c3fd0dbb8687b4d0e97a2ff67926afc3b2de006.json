Reminder: There are 104 days until the Iowa caucuses and 378 days until the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Trump has happily waded into the intraparty feud between Hillary Clinton and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, not just to criticize his 2016 opponent but to defend the honor of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who many Democrats blame for Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016. With Election Day just over a year away, the topic of potential third-party spoilers entering the race has been raised.\n\nLast week, Clinton said that Russia was \u201calso going to do third-party again\u201d and suggested without specific evidence that they were grooming Gabbard for that role, a charge Gabbard vociferously disputed, to the point of challenging Clinton to enter the primary and challenge her directly. Gabbard told CNN in August that she had ruled out a third-party bid.\n\nClinton also attacked Stein, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s a Russian asset \u2014 I mean, totally. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate. So I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton just called the respected environmentalist and Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, a \u2018Russian Asset,\u2019\u201d wrote Trump in a tweet over the weekend. \u201cThey need a Green Party more than ever after looking at the Democrats disastrous environmental program!\u201d\n\nBecause Stein\u2019s vote total was higher than Trump\u2019s margin of victory in some critical Midwestern swing states, she has been labeled as a key to Republican victory. But the data doesn\u2019t back up the supposition that all of Stein\u2019s voters would have gone for Clinton: They could have stayed home, opted not to vote for president or switched their vote to a different third-party candidate or even Trump.\n\nFrom left: Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump, Jill Stein and Ross Perot.

Stein, Libertarian Gary Johnson and independent candidate Evan McMullin combined for over five percent of the vote, compared to just 1.5 percent for the third-party candidates in 2012. That opened the door for Trump to win with just 46.1 percent of the popular vote. Third-party voters were still a small fraction of the number of eligible voters who didn\u2019t show up, a total that was roughly 100 million in the last presidential election.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the bump in third-party voting in 2016 was that Trump and his Clinton were what Gallup described as \u201chistorically unpopular\u201d by election day. They were both underwater in popularity, with Clinton at 52 percent disapproval and Trump even deeper at 61 percent disapproval. It\u2019s a sharp contrast to eight years prior, when both Barack Obama and John McCain had approval ratings in the low 60s.\n\nThe electoral system in the United States is not kind to third party candidates. Ross Perot, the Reform Party\u2019s 1992 nominee, had the most success of any recent non-establishment candidate by far, winning 19 percent of the popular vote. But he didn\u2019t earn a single electoral vote, coming closest in Maine where he fell by eight points to eventual winner Bill Clinton.\n\nRalph Nader, the Green Party candidate in 2000, received 97,000 votes in Florida, which went to Republican George W. Bush by a margin of just over 500, and gave him the election. Nader has sought to deflect the charge of being a spoiler in the race, and it\u2019s unreasonable to assume that all of his votes would have gone to Democrat Al Gore instead, but a detailed statistical analysis supports the inference that without him on the ballot the election would have turned out differently.", "description": "Hillary Clinton suggested the Hawaiian congresswoman could help throw the race to Trump, but there are other potential third-party challengers lurking.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/15kD7pbNuhFi8jE8rvF50Q--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/b1a69a30-f4e3-11e9-9ebb-9092f6e5eed1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
