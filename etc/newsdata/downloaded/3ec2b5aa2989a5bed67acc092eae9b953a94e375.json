From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nCouncils only use bed and breakfasts as a last resort, but the continued loss of social housing was leaving many with no alternative in which to house homeless families, the LGA said.\n\nThere are currently 7,040 households in bed and breakfast accommodation \u2013 up from 2,450 a decade ago, an increase of 187 per cent.\n\nTermination of a private rented sector tenancy is now one of the biggest causes of homelessness, with 97 per cent of areas in England currently unaffordable for renters who are entitled to housing support.\n\nCllr David Renard, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesperson, said the \u201clast thing\u201d councils wanted to be doing was placing people in bed and breakfast accommodation, but that they were increasingly exhausting all their options and having little choice but to use B&Bs.\n\n\u201cNot only is this far from ideal for families, it is very expensive for councils, who are already under significant financial pressures,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cCouncils would much rather use these scarce resources to build more affordable homes and prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place.\u201d\n\nHe urged the government to use the Queen\u2019s Speech to \u201ckick-start the genuine renaissance in council housebuilding\u201d which he said was needed to reduce homelessness and solve the national housing crisis.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
