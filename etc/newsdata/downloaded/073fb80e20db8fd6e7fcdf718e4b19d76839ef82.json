REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo\n\nGPI, which runs the Burger King chain of fast-food restaurants in South Africa and operates casinos, had reported a loss last year after its struggling units - Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and ice-cream business Baskin-Robbins - dented the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nThe closure of both units, announced earlier this year after GPI failed to find a buyer, helped lift the investment company\u2019s headline earnings per share (HEPS).\n\nThe company\u2019s HEPS - the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items, came in at 8.91 cents per share compared with a headline loss of 11.18 cents per share last year.\n\n\u201cWe have made excellent progress in improving the overall profitability of the business, and this will continue to be a strong focus, along with driving new restaurant growth in Burger King,\u201d CEO Mohsin Tajbhai said in a statement.\n\nIn 2016, GPI signed a franchise agreement with Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group, which owns Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, betting that South African demand for snacks and drinks from international chains would hold up, despite pressures on disposable income.\n\nHowever, retailers have been struggling to boost sales as a slowing economy, high unemployment rate and rising fuel costs reduced consumers\u2019 spending power.\n\nThe liquidation of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts unit saw Grand Parade\u2019s headline loss narrow to 25.1 million rand ($1.70 million) from 36.6 million rand last year, while Baskin-Robbins\u2019 loss reduced to 11.5 million rand from 24.9 million rand in the year-ago period.\n\nGPI said the company is planning to focus on its Burger King outlets, which helped lift earnings to 38 million rand, compared with 27.1 million rand loss posted a year earlier.\n\n($1 = 14.7270 rand)", "description": "Grand Parade Investments (GPI) on Friday posted a full-year profit as closure of its loss-making Dunkin' Donuts unit lifted the South African investment company's earnings.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431901551&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0HY-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
