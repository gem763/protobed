Five plays later, Dobbins scored on a 14-yard run.\n\nAD\n\nWith 11:49 to play in the fourth quarter, Young swooped in on Coan for a four-yard sack, again jarring the ball loose. Werner recovered for a second time, and eight snaps later, Fields completed a four-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Chris Olave for the final points.\n\nAD\n\nTime to put Chase Young at the top of your Heisman rankings \ud83e\udd2d\n\n\n\nMatchup NIGHTMARE.\n\n\n\n(via @CFBONFOX)pic.twitter.com/hA3LJZTJRf \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 26, 2019\n\nYoung has played defensive end and linebacker this season and is forecast to be among the first few players selected in the NFL draft if he declares after this season.\n\nThrough eight games, Young has 13.5 sacks, one short of breaking Vernon Gholston\u2019s program record for a season. Young also is on pace to challenge major college football\u2019s single-season sack record of 24, set by Alabama\u2019s Terrell Suggs in 2004.\n\n\u201cObviously going into the season you want to play the best. You want to break every record,\u201d Young told reporters outside the Buckeyes locker room. \u201cBut I feel like right now I really, you know, just can\u2019t be worried about a sack record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got keep on trying to perfect my craft and do what I do, and those other things will come.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The 2016 Washington Post All-Met Defensive Player of the Year matches Buckeyes' single-game record with four sacks in 38-7 win against Wisconsin.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cr4vgTAYMeP6XSiOvdlcN-xTENA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OVHAVNHYFMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
