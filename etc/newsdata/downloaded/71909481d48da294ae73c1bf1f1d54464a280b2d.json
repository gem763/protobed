Either he can abandon the push to get his Brexit deal passed into U.K. law now and go to the polls on the basis that MPs are blocking him from delivering Brexit. Or he could try and strike a deal with Labour on a new timetable to get his Brexit deal through parliament before pushing for a vote. Whenever he chooses, of course, he'll need a majority of MPs to agree to call a vote.\n\nIn part, his decision will rest on the length of the delay offered by Brussels. European Council President Donald Tusk has urged EU27 leaders to grant the U.K.'s formal request for an extension until January 31, with the possibility of leaving sooner if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by the U.K. and European parliaments. He has the support of the European Parliament, Ireland and Germany, but at a meeting of EU diplomats in Brussels on Wednesday afternoon, France was pushing for a shorter extension, diplomats said. The EU has yet to announce a new deadline.\n\nThe timing of any election will also have significant implications on the positioning of the two main parties, and both are split about which scenario would play most to their advantage.\n\nSo far, Johnson has appeared most tempted by the first option. His spokesman this week has given bullish briefings that \u201cthis broken parliament will always vote for delay rather than a deal,\u201d suggesting that as soon as the EU grants an extension, he will call an election.\n\n\"How much does not delivering Brexit by October 31 hurt Boris Johnson? We just don\u2019t know\u201d \u2014 Anthony Wells, director of YouGov\u2019s political polling\n\nBut polling experts doubt this is the safest bet for the prime minister and today the Johnson-supporting Sun newspaper argued in a leader column that he shouldn't be tempted by a quick poll. \u201cThe Tories have a decent lead in the polls depending on which pollsters you look at, but the question is how well that translates into seats,\u201d said Anthony Wells, director of YouGov\u2019s political polling.\n\nIf the Remain vote splits between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, that could benefit the Tories, but if the two parties do well in different places, \u201ceven quite a big Conservative lead could end up not translating into a particularly good result,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe second question is, how much does not delivering Brexit by October 31 hurt Boris Johnson? We just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Tories have their eye on Labour-held, Brexit-voting seats in the north, but it\u2019s not clear if they can win them. \u201cIt\u2019s hard territory for them,\u201d Wells said. In seats such as Mansfield, which the Tories took off Labour last time, \u201cthere were demographic movements on their side anyway,\u201d with populations that are becoming older and more middle class.\n\nTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, said that by triggering an election before he has delivered Brexit, Johnson \u201cruns the risk of Nigel Farage telling the country that this isn\u2019t really Brexit and that he might not get it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s actually got the Withdrawal Bill through, Farage may criticize the kind of Brexit that Boris Johnson has achieved, but it will be very difficult to argue to voters that Brexit hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Bale said. He suggested that missing the October 31 deadline may not damage Johnson much if he uses the extra time to get his deal through. \u201cCompetence is a very big factor in British elections, and being seen to have delivered on a promise \u2014 albeit a few weeks late \u2014 will be a massive advantage to Boris Johnson.\u201d\n\nUltimately, according to Bale, voters who are planning to vote Tory \u201cjust want to \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 \u2014 and they will reward the person who has done that for them.\u201d\n\nDavid Herszenhorn and Jacopo Barigazzi contributed reporting.\n\nThis insight is from POLITICO's Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU available to Brexit Pro subscribers.
