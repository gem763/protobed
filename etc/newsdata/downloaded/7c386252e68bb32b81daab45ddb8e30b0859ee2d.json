Donations will be held in the cryptocurrency that the contribution is made in and grants will be paid out in the same cryptocurrency.\n\nIt seems that UNICEF actually believes that cryptocurrencies and their associated technologies will become a significant part of our future.\n\n\u201cIf digital economies and currencies have the potential to shape the lives of coming generations, it is important that we explore the opportunities they offer,\u201d said UNICEF\u2018s executive director Henrietta Fore. \u201cThat\u2019s why the creation of our Cryptocurrency Fund is a significant and welcome step forward in humanitarian and development work.\u201d\n\nThe first contributions to the fund come from the Ethereum ETH Foundation and is submitting the donation through a French branch of UNICEF.\n\nThe executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, Aya Miyaguchi, said in keynote speech at the Ethereum conference, DevCon, that 100 ETH (around $18,000 at the time of writing) has already been sent to UNICEF\u2018s new fund, CoinDesk reported.\n\nUSA, Australia, and New Zealand branches of UNICEF are also primed to receive cryptocurrency.\n\nThe first three projects to be granted funding are Prescrypto, a prescription tracking tool, Atix Labs, a software house, and Utopixar, a token-based rewards system to encourage social change.\n\nWhether any of the fund\u2019s recipients go on to make a noticeable social impact remains to be seen.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of what happens if the markets tank. Hard Fork has reached out to UNICEF to find out how it plans to deal with sudden cryptocurrency devaluations, and will update this piece should we receive a reply.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that UNICEF has turned to cryptocurrency to boost donations.\n\nLast year, UNICEF Australia used an iteration of cryptocurrency mining script Coinhive to allow people to donate their CPU power and mine Monero on its behalf when they visited website The Hope Page.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
