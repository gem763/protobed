It\u2019s also claimed that the squad are unhappy with a lack of days off and they feel mentally burdened by the demands put on them by Pochettino.\n\nThe players didn\u2019t appear to be carrying much mental baggage during their demolishing of Belgrade, who were put to the sword by braces from Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son, as well as a goal from Erik Lamela.\n\nSpurs refound their form against Red Star (Picture: Getty)\n\nAnd, speaking after the game, Pochettino raised the rumours himself in an interview with BT Sport and dismissed the suggestion as nonsense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked if the result was a positive one for his side, Pochettino said: \u2018Yes for the confidence and then tomorrow day off because we score five goals\u2026there\u2019s always rumours and complaints about a day off [laughs].\n\n\u2018I say \u201cokay, you want day off? Then day off tomorrow. If you\u2019re going to be happy like this with a day off then fine, day off\u201d.\n\n\u2018Always in football you try to find reasons from nowhere but the problem was on the pitch. Our performances weren\u2019t great and that\u2019s all.\u2019\n\nPochettino reverted to a 4-2-3-1, pairing Tanguy Ndombele with Moussa Sissoko behind a front four of Kane, Son, Dele Alli and Lamela.\n\nSpurs raced into a 2-0 lead thanks to their high energy pressing game and it appeared to be a return to the tactics that made Pochettino such a success in north London.\n\nThe Argentine admits the club have lost their way since last season but says it\u2019s how you respond to setbacks that matter.\n\n\u2018You always try to find a way\u2026.a spark for the team to start again,\u2019 said Pochettino.\n\n\u2018There are things in football you cannot explain. The dynamic changed after the final of the Champions League of course it\u2019s so difficult and complex to explain but the most important thing is to build together, not to create drama, to stay calm and to believe. To know this can happen in any team but to stay strong in your principles and translate that confidence to the squad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Of course you cannot stop the rumours but the most important thing is to show we are together. If we don\u2019t win then the reason is because we are not performing, not some stupid thing happen inside.\u2019\n\nMORE: Tanguy Ndombele masterclass gives Spurs fans tantalising glimpse of new era under Mauricio Pochettino", "description": "Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hit back at claims he's lost the dressing room after his side's 5-0 win against Red Star Belgrade.
