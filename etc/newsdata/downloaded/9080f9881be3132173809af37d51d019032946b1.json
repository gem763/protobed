Further, there were, in my judgement no reasonable grounds to believe \u2018Nick\u2019 and the statement that he had told the truth was not consistent with information then available.\u2019\n\nMr Proctor said the Met\u2019s commissioner Cressida Dick should \u2018consider her position\u2019, accusing her of showing \u2018no leadership or professional ability to insist on investigation into Beech himself.\u2019\n\nHe accused her of failing to change previously inaccurate statements on Beech\u2019s credibility, reports MailOnline.\n\nSeveral disturbing drawings appearing to depict abuse were examined during Beech\u2019s trial (Picture: PA)\n\nFormer Conservative MP Harvey Proctor was also a victim of Beech\u2019s false claims (Picture: PA)\n\nThe former politician said police involved in the case \u2018lacked common sense and yielded to intense pressure from Tom Watson\u2019.\n\nHe branded Watson \u2018an irresponsible politician out for his own publicity in to galvanise his advancement to become deputy leader of the Labour Party\u2019.\n\nMr Proctor\u2019s barrister, Geoffrey Robertson QC, said: \u2018Operation Midland was conducted incompetently, negligently and almost with institutional stupidity.\n\n\u2018The allegations were inherently incredible, there was not a shred of evidence during or after they were investigated and Beech had already been shown by another police force to be a fantasist.\u2019\n\nCressida Dick has been slammed for \u2018showing no leadership\u2019 over the case (Picture: REX)\n\nWatson said the report contains \u2018multiple inaccuracies\u2019 about him which he says has been \u2018selectively leaked\u2019 in a bid to move the spotlight away from the Met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the findings do not make it clear that Lord Brittan was interviewed by police before they received his letter, which sir Richard said sent officers into a \u2018panic\u2019.\n\nThe MP for West Bromwich added: \u2018I have always said that it wasn\u2019t my place to judge whether sexual abuse allegations were true or false \u2013 that was for the police.\n\n\u2018The police asked me to encourage the hundreds of people that came to me with stories of child abuse to report their stories to the police.
