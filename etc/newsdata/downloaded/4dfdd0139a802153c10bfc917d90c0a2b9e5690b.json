Since July, the S&P 500 has lost roughly 135 points because of the trade war, according to its data.\n\nSource: Renaissance Macro Research More\n\nTrump still cares about big stock market losses, but \u201cnot as much as people think,\u201d says Dutta. Trump said last week that short-term economic pain inflicted on the U.S. will not deter him from his tariff strategy. \u201cChina has been ripping this country off for 25 years, for longer than that and it\u2019s about time whether it\u2019s good for our country or bad for our country short term. Long term it\u2019s imperative that somebody does this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Dow soared more than 200 points on Monday after Trump said China and the U.S. are getting back to the negotiating table. At the G7 summit standing next to French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said China wants to make a deal \u201cvery badly\u201d and that \u201c[he\u2019s] not sure they have a choice.\u201d\n\nInvestors, however, may have been too eager to reward the president\u2019s optimism with a lift in stocks. Trump has no plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping directly and he\u2019s recently shown an ability to stomach bigger market losses. The more than 600-point drop in the Dow following China\u2019s retaliatory tariff escalation Friday only compelled Trump to hit back with higher tariffs. Trump said the $300 billion worth of imports from China that were set to be taxed at a 10% rate on Sept. 1 will now be taxed at a 15% rate; and starting Oct. 1, the $250 billion worth of Chinese imports currently taxed at 25% will be taxed at a rate of 30%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens to a question during a press conference on the third and final day of the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France Monday, Aug. 26, 2019.

Results of a recent Pew Research Center survey indicate Americans believe economic ties between China and the U.S. are poor. And what\u2019s more, unfavorable opinions of China have reached a 14-year high. According to the survey 60% have an unfavorable opinion of China, up from 47% in 2018.\n\nThere\u2019s also no guarantee that a Democratic president will drop Trump\u2019s tariff strategy. Although presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was critical of Trump\u2019s latest escalation of tariffs over the weekend, he asserted that \u201cof course\u201d he, too, would use tariffs to reach a deal with China.\n\nIn the meantime, companies are slowly trying to move their global supply chains out of China. As more American companies do this, Xi continues to lose leverage.\n\nMore from Sibile:\n\nThese people are most likely to lose their jobs first in a recession\n\nHow Fed Chair Powell can avoid a stock market nightmare\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s efforts to keep immigrants out hurts the U.S. economy\n\nTrump delays tariffs to appease Christmas shoppers\n\nHere\u2019s the truth about Trump\u2019s Pledge to America\u2019s Workers", "description": "Stock market losses no longer act as a constraint on the President\u2019s trade agenda, says Renmac\u2019s head of economics.", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rCM9sW_cEyTpkjbjwNBGFg--~B/aD04Nzc7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/02dc8360-c90b-11e9-ba9e-390d6c97c35d", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
