There is a growing amount of research in this field of integrative oncology which supports the use of complementary therapies in collaboration with traditional oncology care.\n\nThe Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) published guidelines approved by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 2018 specifically for breast cancer patients.\n\nHere's a breakdown of treatments that are currently recommended, and not recommended, according to available science.\n\nNon-traditional methods to add to your breast cancer care\n\nAnxiety and stress is very common when undergoing breast cancer treatment. \"Approximately 30% to 54% of breast cancer patients in the US suffer from anxiety within 2 years after diagnosis and 13% to 15% have symptoms of anxiety that persist for years,\" according to a recent study. Anxiety can significantly impact the quality of life of breast cancer patients and how well someone tolerates treatment.\n\nMeditation has the highest rated evidence for reducing anxiety related symptoms. Meditation may be intimidating to start as some people find difficulty being alone with their thoughts, but there are also meditation phone apps such as 10% Happier, Headspace and Calm that many find helpful.\n\nOther methods that have shown to improve anxiety and stress in breast cancer patients include music therapy, stress management and yoga. Acupuncture, massage and relaxation can also be considered for reducing anxiety.\n\nPHOTO: Yoga4cancer (Yoga4cancer) More\n\nWhat's recommended versus what's not to control symptoms\n\nAlthough there has been significant improvements in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, some breast cancer patients experience difficulty in getting their symptoms controlled.\n\nBefore starting any of these therapies or practices, please discuss these treatments with your cancer doctors.", "description": "When Teri Richardson was given the diagnosis of breast cancer, she said she felt like her breath was taken away.
