The Democrats said the public will soon understand how Mr. Trump improperly pressured Ukraine for an investigation of Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d the Democratic chairs of four key committees said in a joint statement. \u201cThe next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the resolution Thursday.\n\nThe White House blasted the resolution as a scam to railroad the president.\n\n\u201cThe resolution put forward by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi confirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote,\u201d said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. \u201cThe White House is barred from participating at all, until after [Intelligence Committee] Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the administration.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 path forward makes it more likely that the highly charged impeachment proceedings will extend into next year\u2019s presidential campaign and congressional elections.\n\n\u201cWe are not bound by any timeline,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat.\n\nAs the Democrats\u2019 machinery of impeachment ground on, the president met with 25 faith leaders at the White House Tuesday, including James Dobson, Ralph Reed and pastors Paula White of Florida and Robert Jeffress of Dallas.\n\n\u201cThey took the time to pray for the president and for the nation,\u201d said Deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere. \u201cThe leaders discussed the administration\u2019s many accomplishments for the American people and how the communities they represent from across the country are benefitting from these important policies.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders have been under intense pressure to hold a vote formally authorizing an impeachment inquiry, after weeks of secretive hearings and selective leaks building their case against the president. It culminated last week in Republican lawmakers storming into the secure hearing room, demanding an open process.\n\nBut Mrs. Pelosi has been reluctant to call for a recorded floor vote, with Democrats from districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016 worried about casting an early vote against him.\n\nCritics said the resolution still doesn\u2019t formally authorize an impeachment inquiry. It simply directs the three relevant committees \u201cto continue their ongoing investigations.\u201d\n\nUnder the resolution, Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \u2014 the president\u2019s chief nemesis \u2014 would be given the power to call open hearings in which he and ranking Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California or their staffers could ask questions of witnesses for up to 45 minutes each. Other lawmakers would get five minutes.\n\nThe measure also spells out that the depositions of numerous witnesses who have testified privately to date \u2014 including Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman of the White House National Security Council staff, who testified against the president on Tuesday \u2014 will be made public. But the resolution provides for redactions of classified material and other information deemed \u201csensitive.\u201d\n\nThe open-ended investigation by the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees would eventually provide a report by Mr. Schiff\u2019s panel to the House Judiciary Committee, which would then craft its own rules for drawing up articles of impeachment and holding formal impeachment hearings. The resolution says the Intelligence committee will submit \u201cfindings and recommendations.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Louisiana Republican, called the process a \u201cSoviet-style\u201d inquiry and urged GOP lawmakers to vote against the resolution. His office said the measure \u201creaffirms and builds upon [the] tainted process by using the biased evidence obtained as the foundation for impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution fails to provide the minority and the administration with the same due process rights which have been afforded in past presidential impeachments and is simply meant to authorize the production of a tainted document authored by Chairman Schiff,\u201d his office said in a whip notice.\n\nMr. Scalise and Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, complained that Mr. Schiff shut down Republicans\u2019 questions in the private session on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely ridiculous and it\u2019s why this should be in public,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.\n\nBefore the resolution was introduced, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner dismissed the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort Tuesday as \u201csilly games.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to impeach the president for the last three years, or get him out of office, and they have been unsuccessful,\u201d Mr. Kushner told Israel\u2019s Channel 13 News in his first public comments on impeachment. \u201cThe best thing going for the president is that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and at this point, they\u2019ve investigated him over and over and over again. I think the American people are sick and tired of it.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s son-in-law said Mr. Trump\u2019s record of accomplishment \u201cis unimpeachable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to do the things that the American people care about,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cIf [Democrats] want to play silly games, then we\u2019ll obviously deal with that in the appropriate manner, but we\u2019re not going to let that distract us as an administration.\u201d\n\nIn the secure room at the Capitol where lawmakers have questioned witnesses, Lt. Col. Vindman told lawmakers that he was concerned about the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he warned Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland \u2014 a key player in the Ukraine incident \u2014 that the push to open an investigation into the Biden family crossed a line.\n\nHe also said he raised his concerns with the NSC lead counsel.\n\nCol. Vindman is the first current White House official to testify. A Purple Heart recipient, he was cast as a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d by the president before his testimony began Tuesday morning.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing with a packed schedule through next week, including a deposition with Timothy Morrison, who allegedly told William Taylor, a top diplomat to Ukraine, about military aid being contingent on Ukraine opening up investigations for the president.\n\nDemocrats said in a \u201cfact sheet\u201d that the president and his team will be able to respond in the eventual Judiciary hearings to evidence, to request additional testimony or witnesses, and attend the hearings.\n\nThe White House said it amounts to a \u201cscam\u201d in which Mr. Schiff, \u201cwho repeatedly lies to the American people, [will] hold a new round of hearings, still without any due process for the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House\u2019s rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2014 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cThis resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the administration.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
