He had this alphabet board to talk with.\n\n'Instead of answering with \"no\" or \"yes\" he would answer in an incredibly long sentence. But he had depression and felt terribly guilty that he was a burden.\n\n'My way of coping at 13 was I found an agent. I thought, \"f**k this, I'm going to invent my own life\". It was a refusal to accept what happened.'\n\nThe Harry Potter star, who is now one of Britain's most iconic actresses, believes her passion for acting stems from 'dysmorphia', as she finds it therapeutic to 'be someone else'.\n\nIconic: The Crown actress, now 53, was just 13 when her father Raymond underwent an operation to remove a brain tumour, which tragically went wrong and left him quadriplegic and partially blind (pictured 2018)\n\nThe star added that it was a 'release' to become someone else and that she 'couldn't wait' to play other people.\n\nHelena has built up a reputation for taking on gothic roles, such as Bellatrix Lestrange in the Harry Potter' movies, Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and several other movies directed by her ex-partner Tim Burton.\n\nThe star admitted that although she feels 'typecast' as a villain, she doesn't mind as she has always wanted to be a 'character.'\n\nHelena never went to drama school and made her professional acting debut jn a TV advert aged 16.\n\nStart: She said: 'My way of coping at 13 was I found an agent.
