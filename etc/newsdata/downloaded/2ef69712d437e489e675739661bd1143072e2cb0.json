She is still having her surname pronounced as \"tee-am\".\n\nAs her father is Senegalese, her name is pronounced \"cham\", as in (appropriately) champion, which she once was.\n\nAfter all the medals she has picked up, you would have thought someone would have thought: \"That's an unusual name; I wonder how it's pronounced?\"\n\nHowever, it seems it has always been a case of: \"Let's just give it a shot and say anything. No-one will notice.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nBut, oh boy, we Africans have noticed.\n\nIn the pre-social media days, we would phone each other and say: \"Did you hear how they pronounced that name?\"\n\nNowadays, we are more likely to share audio or video clips seconds after the \"offence\" has been committed.\n\nAde Daramy Mame Biram Diouf has the distinction of having both his first name and his surname serially mispronounced\"\n\nSuch \"fouls\" are also common in the world of football where with such huge African stars playing for major European clubs one would have thought their names would trip off the tongue.\n\nTop tips\n\nCommentators who have no problem pronouncing Spanish defender Cesar Azpilicueta's last name can trash the two-syllable surname of Mohamed Diam\u00e9, the former Senegalese international who now plays in Qatar.\n\nImage copyright Fifa via Getty Image caption Mame Biram Diouf's name should be pronounced \"Mam Biram Joof\"\n\nSo here's a quick guide for commentators out there:\n\nDiam\u00e9 - it is not pronounced \"dee-ah-may\", but \"jammeh\" exactly as the surname of that former Gambian President Yahyah Jammeh\n\nLiverpool star and Senegalese player Sadio Man\u00e9's first name is not pronounced \"sah-dee-oh\", but \"sah-jaw\"\n\nThe first name of England's Dele Alli is shortened from the Nigerian name \"Bamidele\" - and therefore does not rhyme with \"telly, jelly or smelly\", but with \"waylay\"\n\nThe surname of Stoke City's Mame Biram Diouf, from Senegal, is not pronounced \"dee-oof\", but \"joof\", rhyming with roof\n\nBadou Ndiaye is also with Stoke and from Senegal - and his last name does not sound like \"in-de-eye\" or \"en-gee\", but \"nj-eye\"\n\nFor Fulham's Aboubakar Kamara, who is of Mauritanian descent - pronounce each syllable \"ka-ma-ra\"\n\nThe last name of Moussa Wagu\u00e9 of Senegal, who plays with Barcelona, does not rhyme with \"vague\". It is pronounced \"wah-geh\"\n\nFrom this list you can see that for Senegal their talent on the pitch is a double-edged sword.\n\nIn fact, Mame Biram Diouf has the distinction of having both his first name and his surname serially mispronounced.\n\nHe is not \"Mamay Biram Dee-oof\", but \"Mam Biram Joof\".\n\n'Get ear plugs'\n\nAnd it isn't enough for a player like Pape Bouba Diop to score the goal that defeated defending champions France in the first game of the 2002 World Cup or that he spent a combined eight years in English football, for him to get his name said correctly.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Papa Bouba Diop scored against France in the 2002 World Cup\n\nHe was always referred to as \"Papa Bouba Dee-op\" - for the record, the first name is pronounced \"pap\", which rhymes with trap, cap or slap, and the surname rhymes with \"robe\".\n\nIt's a pity to be pointing this out when his 17-year career has ended, as it would have been nice to have heard his name pronounced correctly, even once, during his playing days.\n\nAhead of the last football World Cup, I produced what I called \"Ade Daramy's World Cup Primer\" (that's pronounced as \"Aa-day and Da-ra-mee\").\n\nIt advised Africans to make sure they had at least a couple of essentials for every global sporting contest: a widescreen TV and earplugs.\n\nSo if commentators cannot be bothered to or will not change their ways - we will just have to settle down, get in the popcorn and keep buying those earplugs and endure for the next World Cup kicking off in Qatar in 2022.\n\nMore Letters from Africa\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica", "description": "A guide to correctly saying the names of West Africa's sporting successes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B2A4/production/_109323754_gettyimages-text.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
