The World Health Organisation has classified playing video games on the internet as an official mental health disorder. 'Gaming disorder' is defined as 'a pattern of gaming behaviour characterised by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.' To be diagnosed with gaming disorder, the individual must: (1) Experience significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (2) Have experienced this impairment for at least 12 months WHO advises gamers to be mindful of how much time they spend playing, especially if it is to the exclusion of other daily activities. They should also be alert to changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning which could be attributed to gaming.\n\n'The NHS is rising to the challenge - as it always does - with these new, innovative services, but we can't be expected to pick up the pieces, which is why tech giants need to recognise the impact that products which encourage repeated and persistent use have on young people and start taking their responsibilities seriously too.'\n\nDr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, director of the Centre for Internet and Gaming Disorders and the Royal College of Psychiatrists' spokeswoman on behavioural addictions, said: 'Gaming disorder is a serious mental health condition which can have a hugely debilitating effect on people's lives, both for patients and their families who can be left feeling utterly helpless in the wake of their loved one's addiction.\n\n'Gaming disorder is not a mental illness to be taken lightly: we are talking about instances where someone may spend up to 12 hours a day playing computer games and can end up becoming socially isolated and lose their job as a result. I am delighted to be leading this new clinic.'\n\nThe new treatment centre for gaming addiction will be based at the National Centre for Behavioural Addictions in London, which also hosts a service for betting addicts.\n\nMr Stevens has previously said is unfair taxpayers are being forced to 'pick up the huge tab' for the expansion of services to help people who are addicted to online gambling.\n\nHe called for a mandatory levy on betting firms and slammed them for 'pumping out' online adverts.\n\nMany other countries are grappling with the issue of gaming and internet addiction.\n\nIn South Korea, the government has introduced a law banning access for children under 16 from online games between midnight and 6am.\n\nMeanwhile, in Japan, players are alerted if they spend more than a certain amount of time each month playing games.\n\nIn China, internet giant Tencent has also limited the hours that children can play its most popular games.", "description": "Teenagers addicted to gaming will get one-to-one therapy from psychiatrists either in person at the National Centre for Behavioural Addictions in London clinic or via Skype (file, action from Fortnite)", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward Health Reporter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19401030-0-image-a-10_1570460345341.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
