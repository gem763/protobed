As we squander election after election, Labour\u2019s pro-Remain membership has drained away.\n\nYesterday\u2019s shift towards backing a Final Say on Brexit in two hypothetical scenarios, and promising to campaign for Remain in one of them, is just another step in what seems like an endless journey. It\u2019s certainly progress \u2013 but we\u2019re not there yet.\n\nIn Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s email to Labour members, which followed a discussion on Monday with party affiliated trade unions, he wrote that \u201cwhoever becomes the new prime minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or no deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for Remain.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

But Corbyn does not mention the second scenario agreed with union leaders such as Len McCluskey, a Eurosceptic with considerable influence on party policy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Why would Labour want to give itself the option of campaigning against their own deal? And, more fundamentally, why is there no clear condemnation of the very concept of Brexit?\n\nMy party, and the country as a whole, deserves better. Young people especially need to know that their futures aren\u2019t being weighed against political expediency.\n\nWe don\u2019t need more platitudes and fudges. We don\u2019t need assurances that the leadership has our best interests at heart \u2013 and we certainly don\u2019t need a list of very specific circumstances listed out in which they would consider saving us from a project which the majority of the country now knows is doomed to end in disaster.\n\nThe positive case for Brexit has all but collapsed. Arguments which claimed we would be happier, healthier, and richer in the mythical sunlit uplands after breaking ties with our closest allies and trading partners are now only memories. Instead, we hear about periods of \u201ceconomic turmoil\u201d, necessary sacrifices, and desperate promises of sufficient food, water and medicine. Believe in Britain indeed.\n\nNot a single person has put forward a clear and viable solution to the Northern Irish border in the event of Brexit becoming a reality, and that is because there isn\u2019t one. Regardless of the \u201ctechnological solutions\u201d (which sound more and more like magic than modern tech advances) proffered by politicians who are unable to provide any detail of what those solutions might be, the fact remains that the Good Friday Agreement would be violated in every single type of Brexit, be it no deal, Norway-plus, Canada-plus, a customs union, or whichever pie-in-the-sky fantasy happens to be the flavour of the week in Westminster.\n\nAs a country we have woken up. So why is Labour determined to avoid condemning this plutocratic project in all but the most specific of circumstances?\n\nJeremy Corbyn says that Labour is for the many, not the few. Until his claims are backed up by an unambiguous support for remaining in the EU, they are simply empty words.\n\nCathleen Clarke is an activist with Our Future, Our Choice", "description": "As a Remain-supporting Labour member, watching my party\u2019s leadership being dragged towards the position that the majority of its voters and members already\u00a0hold has been nothing short of agonising.", "authors": ["Cathleen Clarke"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/09/11/corbyn-austerity.jpg"}
