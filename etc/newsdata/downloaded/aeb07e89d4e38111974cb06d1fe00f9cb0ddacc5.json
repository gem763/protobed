Photo: Gerardo Mora/Getty Images\n\nWith all the hubbub right now surrounding an anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s complaint about President Trump\u2019s questionable July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the subsequent impeachment proceedings against him, let\u2019s check in on Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, to see how he\u2019s doing.\n\nOh.\n\nThe complaint, which was published this week, alleges that President Trump tried to pressure President Zelensky into investigating former vice-president and current 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of next year\u2019s election. Giuliani, in a very Giuliani fashion, is heavily involved in the controversy; he\u2019s been accused of flouting national security procedures in his frequent meetings with Ukrainian officials.\n\nAs the situation grows more serious, Giuliani has responded by publicly spiraling out in a variety of ways, including: saying absolutely deranged things on TV, threatening to start a podcast, calling a journalist to scream about being a hero, and showing off some of his texts on his iPad, which appears to have size 80 font.\n\nHere he is on CNN last week. In just under a minute, the president\u2019s attorney managed to both deny that he had ever pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, and confirm that he had pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden.\n\nRudy denying he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden followed by Rudy admitting he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden within 30 seconds of each other in this clip is just incredible to watch pic.twitter.com/Vx1fTrEz8Q \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 20, 2019\n\nThen, on Thursday, The Atlantic published an interview with Giuliani, in which he ranted against the whistleblower complaint, and fumed, \u201cIt is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons \u2014 when this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\nHours later, on Thursday night, he appeared on The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, and held up an iPad with texts from the administration\u2019s special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker (texts which Giuliani says prove it was the State Department that reached out and asked him for help in Ukraine in the first place) in a font big enough to be seen from the International Space Station.\n\nWe know @RudyGiuliani is not quite on the level, but if these giant iPad texts are real, then it's further evidence we need to investigate the State Department's role in this mess.\n\n\n\nWe have to get to the bottom of this corruption.
