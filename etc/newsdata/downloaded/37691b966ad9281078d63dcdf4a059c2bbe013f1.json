His blunder the following Thanksgiving night schooled the entire Dallas Cowboys in that same painful lesson.\n\nEleven months earlier, Lett\u2019s showboating shy of the goal line after recovering a fumble allowed Don Beebe to catch him from behind and denied Dallas a sure touchdown. But that had come in the Cowboys\u2019 52-17 blowout of Buffalo.\n\nThis time, his gaffe cost the Cowboys a crucial victory over Miami and allowed the Dolphins to pull off a 16-14 win in one of the most bizarre endings in NFL history.\n\nLett, who now tutors defensive tackles for the Cowboys - who host the Dolphins again Sunday - was a Pro Bowl defensive lineman on the Cowboys\u2019 three Super Bowl teams of the 1990s but he\u2019s known as much for two blunders as his big plays.\n\nHe said he looks back on that Thanksgiving night in 1993 \u201cpretty much the same way. It was a cold-ass game and we were winning and we were up and I made a bone-head play.\u201d\n\nThe Dallas sideline went crazy when Jimmie Jones blocked Pete Stoyanovich\u2019s 41-yard field goal try with 15 seconds left and the Cowboys clinging to a 14-13 lead at the old Texas Stadium, where a rare thunder snowstorm had made the field both icy and dicey.\n\nEverybody on the Cowboys sideline was hugging or high-fiving as the football spun like a top on the slush as the final seconds ticked away.\n\n\u201cI thought we had won the game,\u201d Michael Irvin said afterward. \u201cI grabbed Troy Aikman and we were hugging.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy first thought was to look around for someone to shove into it,\u201d Miami center Jeff Dellenbach said that night. \u201cBut then that guy came charging into the damn thing.\u201d\n\nThe roar of the crowd drowned out Lett\u2019s teammates who were yelling, \u201cFire! Fire!\u201d - football code for \u201cStay away!\u201d\n\nLett came barreling in between three Dolphins surrounding the spinning ball and slid between them, his left foot scooting the ball toward the goal line.\n\nSuddenly, the ball was live.\n\nDellenbach recovered the ball at the Dallas 1 with 3 seconds remaining, and Stoyanovich was good on his second chance, nailing the 19-yarder as time expired.\n\nDallas coach Jimmy Johnson called it the most disappointing defeat of his life and Miami coach Don Shula called it the weirdest win he\u2019d ever experienced.\n\nLett hid out in the trainer\u2019s room after the game.\n\n\u201cMy teammates were great. They were my support group. They were doing interviews for me. Nate Newton was doing interviews for me. All my teammates had my back and Coach Johnson had my back,\u201d Lett recalled. \u201cIt was a tough time, but it was also great for me to have that support and those people behind me.\u201d\n\nLett said winning the Super Bowl two months later was all the catharsis he needed.\n\n\u201cI would like to hope people would look at my career as a guy that contributed to three Super Bowl championship teams and (see) a good player that played on some great teams in some great games,\u201d Lett said.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what happened to the teams in the aftermath of that implausible finish:\n\nDALLAS\n\nOddly, it turned out to be the last loss for Jimmy Johnson in Dallas. Jerry Jones fired him a few months later after Dallas had successfully defended its Super Bowl title.\n\nThe Cowboys fell to 7-4 with the loss but won their next eight, beating Buffalo again in the Super Bowl and giving Lett peace of mind.\n\n\u201cWinning that Super Bowl, holding that Super Bowl trophy \u2026 erased all of that and I moved forward,\u201d Lett said.\n\nSo did the Cowboys, who won another Super Bowl under Barry Switzer two years later.\n\nThey\u2019re 4-10 in the playoffs since then, including 2-3 under Jason Garrett, who was Aikman\u2019s backup QB in 1993.\n\nBehind Ezekiel Elliott, Dak Prescott and DeMarcus Lawrence, the Cowboys are 2-0 and believe they\u2019re Super Bowl-capable like those 1990s teams.\n\nMIAMI\n\nThe Dolphins improved to 9-2 with their bizarre win in Dallas but they wouldn\u2019t win again, losing their last five without an injured Dan Marino and missing the playoffs.\n\nShula retired two years later, and Jimmy Johnson replaced him and led Miami to the playoffs three times in his four seasons with the Dolphins.\n\nMiami has fallen on hard times with only two playoff berths in the past 17 seasons and no playoff wins since the 2000 season.\n\nThis year, they\u2019ve been outscored 102-10.\n\nMEMORABLE GAMES\n\n-Jan. 16, 1972. The Cowboys defeat the Dolphins 24-3 in Super Bowl 6 at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans after losing to the Baltimore Colts the year before. It was the Dolphins\u2019 only loss until Sept. 23, 1973, at Oakland, after they\u2019d won Super Bowl 7 over Washington to cap the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\n-Nov. 22, 1973. The Dolphins beat the Cowboys 14-7 in Dallas on their way to repeating as Super Bowl champs.\n\n-Oct. 27, 1996. The Cowboys roll over the Dolphins 29-10 in Miami in a game that was most remarkable for who was on the sidelines: Dallas\u2019 Barry Switzer and Miami\u2019s Jimmy Johnson.\n\n-Nov. 24, 2011. The Cowboys beat the Dolphins 20-19 on another Thanksgiving Day but this time the temperature was 59 degrees, not 32 with 100 percent humidity and wind chill of 19 as it had been in 1993.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Leon Lett learned in the Super Bowl never to celebrate too soon.
