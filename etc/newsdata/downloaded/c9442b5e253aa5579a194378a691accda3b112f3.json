REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nU.S. Open runner-up Medvedev, chasing his fourth ATP Tour title in a breakthrough 2019 season, will meet Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\nThird seed Medvedev won 84% of his first-serve points and saved four of five break points to improve his win-loss record for the calendar year.\n\nThe tiebreak saw the first 10 points won by the server before Medvedev pounced to capture the opening set as Greek sixth seed Tsitsipas struggled with his backhand.\n\nServing for the match at 5-4, Medvedev conceded a break after committing four errors.\n\nBut he shook off the disappointment by breaking Tsitsipas in the next game and went on to book a spot in his sixth straight final with a clinical serve and volley combination.\n\nTSITSIPAS THWARTED\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I really felt good today and I felt like I could win this match. I didn\u2019t feel bad,\u201d said Tsitsipas, who has yet to beat Medvedev after five career meetings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to beat him the next time or the time after that one, but I know there\u2019s going to be a time where I\u2019m going to find opportunities and beat him.\u201d\n\nNovak Djokovic, Rafa Nadal, Roger Federer, Dominic Thiem, Medvedev and Tsitsipas have all booked places in the ATP Finals, with two spots still up for grabs at the season-ending tournament in London.\n\nWorld number six Zverev strengthened his position in the Race To London standings with a 6-3 6-4 win over Italian Matteo Berrettini.\n\nThe victory helped Zverev climb to seventh with 2,855 points in the race, 330 points more than eighth-placed Berrettini.\n\nZverev heads into his first Shanghai Masters final with a 4-0 head-to-head record against Medvedev, although their most recent meeting came over a year ago in Toronto.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played some fantastic matches, all going my way until now. I hope tomorrow that will not change,\u201d fifth seed Zverev said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the best player in the world right now. I hope it\u2019s just going to be a good match tomorrow.\u201d", "description": "Russia's Daniil Medvedev remarkably reached his ninth final of the season as he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6(5) 7-5 at the Shanghai Masters on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440079524&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0G5", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
