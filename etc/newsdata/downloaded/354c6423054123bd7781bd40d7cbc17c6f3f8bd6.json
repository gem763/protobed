REUTERS/Yara Nardi\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brad Pitt traded laughs on Monday in a call to the International Space Station with a NASA astronaut, who somersaulted during the zero-gravity interview ahead of this week\u2019s release of the actor\u2019s new film, the space thriller \u201cAd Astra.\u201d\n\nPitt peppered astronaut Nick Hague with dozens of questions about what life was like in space. He interviewed Hague from Washington via a transmission line from NASA\u2019s Mission Control Center in Houston.\n\n\u201cMost important question: Who controls the jam box?\u201d Pitt asked, referring to the space station\u2019s music.\n\n\u201cWe have a rotating playlist, we take turns. And it\u2019s nice because we have the international flair as well,\u201d Hague replied. \u201cGetting to hear some traditional music from Russia over dinner is a nice change, exposure.\u201d\n\nPitt plays astronaut Roy McBride, who travels to the outer edges of the solar system to find his missing father, confronting a mystery along the way that threatens humanity\u2019s existence back on Earth. \u201cAd Astra\u201d - whose Latin title means \u201cto the stars\u201d - opens in U.S. theaters on Friday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was given an early copy of the movie\u2019s script to provide visual and technical expertise, according to its film and TV liaison, Bert Ulrich. Detailed images of Mars from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory informed the film\u2019s recreation of Martian landscapes, he said. \u201cThe script did not have a NASA storyline, but there were ways that we could still help them,\u201d Ulrich said in an interview, adding that the film shows some parallels to NASA\u2019s Moon-to-Mars Artemis program, such as the way characters use the moon to travel further to Mars.\n\nAfter asking questions like how realistic his zero-gravity movements were in a studio environment - as Hague performed one for him - Pitt said he had one last question \u201cand I need to call on your expertise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was more believable, Clooney or Pitt?\u201d the actor asked, referring to George Clooney, a good friend who played an astronaut in the 2013 film \u201cGravity\u201d and has starred with Pitt in a number of other films.\n\n\u201cYou were, absolutely,\u201d Hague replied.\n\n(This story corrects paragraph two to indicate Pitt interviewed astronaut from Washington, not Houston; Fixes dateline)", "description": "Brad Pitt traded laughs on Monday in a call to the International Space Station with a NASA astronaut, who somersaulted during the zero-gravity interview ahead of this week's release of the actor's new film, the space thriller \"Ad Astra.\"", "authors": ["Joey Roulette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430597780&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1P9-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
