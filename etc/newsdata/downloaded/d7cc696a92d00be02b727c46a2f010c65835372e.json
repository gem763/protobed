There is likely to be a long period of realignment where the manager looks to determine which assets to keep and which to sell and even then, a buyer will have to be found for the assets they wish to dispose of.\n\nThis is likely to be a long process and will incur transaction costs for investors [but] a positive may be that the market responds well to this change and the significant discount closes a little.'\n\nInvestors will see fees rise\n\nA small scrap of comfort for investors in the Patient Capital Trust has been that they have not been paying any fees to Woodford for managing it.\n\nThe trust was launched with no management fee and instead had a performance fee of 15 per cent of any excess returns over 10 per cent a year. It never managed to achieve a level of performance that would have seen a fee charged.\n\nManagement fees will now be set at 1 per cent of the market cap up to \u00a3600million and 0.8 per cent thereafter with no management fee for the first three months.\n\nBut investors need to be wary of a performance fee also set to be introduced. This will be15 per cent of any excess returns above a net asset value per share of 77p, but will only be applied from 31 December 2022.\n\nThe trust would also need to record some growth to get their, with the net asset value at 63.23p on 22 October 2019.\n\nThereafter, a performance fee of 15 per cent of performance above a hurdle of 10 per cent of NAV each year will be payable, subject to a high watermark.\n\nSam Murphy, associate director of investment companies research at Numis, said: 'The change in the fee structure is understandable and we had expected any new manager to have a base and performance fees.\n\n'The performance fee is not earned until the NAV is above 77p, which implies the manager has confidence in the portfolio valuations. In addition, Link/HS Markit has completed a review of the top twenty positions which resulted in numerous painful valuation write downs, but should give comfort that the scope for further write-downs may be limited in the near term.'\n\nBroker upgrades Patient Capital Trust to a buy\n\nBroker Stifel has upgraded its rating for the trust from Hold to Buy following the news as it said the 'clarity on a new manager and appointment of such an experienced house is a positive'.\n\nAnalyst Iain Scouller added: 'This remains a high risk investment with significant uncertainties surrounding unquoted valuations, portfolio liquidity and bank debt renewal remaining.\n\n'However, we do view the clarity on management arrangements as positive for the share price and following the significant fall in the price in recent months, we take a contrarian view and upgrade to Buy.'\n\n'At this stage, the intention appears to be to manage WPCT as a continuing company rather than a run-off vehicle. We think the board needs to take soundings from shareholders on this issue now that the new manager has been unveiled.\n\n'In the short term, it appears that making new investments will be difficult given the need to pay down bank debt. We hope there may be some unquoted realisations in the weeks ahead, which would help.'", "description": "Woodford's name will be removed from his trust, which was launched to much fanfare, and it will be rebranded as the Schroder UK Public Private Trust.", "authors": ["Jayna Rana For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
