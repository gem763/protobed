The researchers published the revelation and a debugged version of the script, which amounts to roughly 1,000 lines of code, on Tuesday in the journal Organic Letters.\n\n\u201cThis simple glitch in the original script calls into question the conclusions of a significant number of papers on a wide range of topics in a way that cannot be easily resolved from published information because the operating system is rarely mentioned,\u201d the new paper reads. \u201cAuthors who used these scripts should certainly double-check their results and any relevant conclusions using the modified scripts in the [supplementary information].\u201d\n\nYuheng Luo, a graduate student at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, discovered the glitch this summer when he was verifying the results of research conducted by chemistry professor Philip Williams on cyanobacteria. The aim of the project was to \"try to find compounds that are effective against cancer,\u201d Williams said.\n\nUnder supervision of University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa assistant chemistry professor Rui Sun, Luo used a script written in Python that was published as part of a 2014 paper by Patrick Willoughby, Matthew Jansma, and Thomas Hoye in the journal Nature Protocols . The code computes chemical shift values for NMR, or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a common technique used by chemists to determine the molecular make-up of a sample.\n\nLuo\u2019s results did not match up with the NMR values that Williams\u2019 group had previously calculated, and according to Sun, when his students ran the code on their computers, they realized that different operating systems were producing different results. Sun then adjusted the code to fix the glitch, which had to do with how different operating systems sort files.\n\nWilloughby, the first author of the 2014 study who wrote the script, called the new study \u201ca beautiful example of science working to advance the work we reported in 2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did a tremendous service to the community in figuring this out,\u201d he said.\n\nWilliams said that the original study is an elegantly written paper that is \u201cincredibly useful to a large group of people, and the error is very subtle.\" Nevertheless, the researchers believe that the glitch could have produced serious downstream effects.\n\nFor example, if the code led Williams to wrongly identify the contents of his sample, chemists trying to recreate the molecule to test as a potential cancer drug would be chasing after the wrong compound, Williams said.\n\n\u201cThe process of science here worked exactly as it\u2019s supposed to\"\n\nIt is unclear how many papers this glitch may have affected\u2014researchers do not typically disclose the operating system they use for their analyses since it should be irrelevant, Williams said. According to metrics from Nature Protocols, the 2014 paper has been accessed nearly 1,900 times and cited in 158 other studies. However, not every study that cited the paper may have used the script.\n\nRob Keyzers, a chemistry lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand who had cited the protocol in a study published this year, said in an email that he was not aware of the glitch. He added that he was not \u201cunduly worried\u201d about his results since his group did not use the script containing the glitch. \u201cI will certainly check our data carefully to make sure that we are not making any undue claims though,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late July, Williams and Sun reached out to the authors of the original paper, alerting them to the glitch. Williams said he hoped that by working together, they could bring the problem to the attention of researchers who had used the code.\n\n\u201cI personally haven\u2019t had the opportunity to go to the original authors [of a study] and announce a bug, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect,\u201d Sun said, adding that the authors were \u201cvery gracious\u201d and encouraged him and Williams to publish their findings.\n\n\u201cThe process of science here worked exactly as it\u2019s supposed to,\u201d Williams said.\n\nProcess chemist Lucas Moore, who tweeted about the study, said in an email that \u201cnews of a bug like this is something that we in the scientific community tend to spread far and wide\u2013we really want to get it right.\u201d\n\nWilloughby and Hoye plan to update the Nature Protocols study acknowledging the glitch and providing Sun\u2019s fixed code, according to correspondence from Hoye quoted in the new paper.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Nature Protocols said that they are looking into the issues raised in the new study, but for confidentiality reasons cannot comment on individual cases.\n\nThe incident is a reminder that science is collaborative and ideally self-correcting, but that nothing can be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cThis is a very small and subtle error,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe all kind of assume that a computer program always spits out the correct answer.\u201d", "description": "The discovery is a reminder that science is collaborative and ideally self-correcting, but that nothing can be taken for granted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e474a99d7c90009cb4964/lede/1570655089492-GettyImages-1026204996.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
