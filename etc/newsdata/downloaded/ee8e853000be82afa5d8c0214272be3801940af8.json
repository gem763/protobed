Justin then moved on with Hailey Baldwin, but Selena kept a low profile and reportedly spent some time focusing on her own health (as well as moving behind-the-scenes and producing content for Netflix).\n\nNow, on Tuesday, the 27-year-old has released a new song and video, and a lot of people think it's about her relationship with the Sorry hitmaker, who recently said \"I do\" to Hailey Baldwin in a lavish ceremony. The song is titled Lose You to Love Me.\n\nAs with any art, this song might be about anyone, but we decided to take a closer look at the song's lyrics as they might relate to Selena's famous past relationship.\n\nHERE'S A LOOK AT SOME OF THE LINES IN THE SONG THAT COULD BE ABOUT JUSTIN:\n\n\"You promised the world and I fell for it/ I put you first and you adored it/ You set fires to my forest/ And you let it burn/ Sang off-key in my chorus 'cause it wasn't yours.\"\n\n\"I saw the signs and I ignored it/ Rose-coloured glasses all distorted.\"\n\n\"You set fire to my purpose, and I let it burn/ You got off on the hurtin', when it wasn't yours.\" NOTE: Justin's 2015 album was titled, Purpose.\n\n\"In two months, you replaced us/ Like it was easy/ Made me think I deserved it, in the thick of healing.\" NOTE: Selena and Justin reportedly broke up in April. The 25-year-old was then spotted on reportedly his first date with Hailey Bieber in June. They were then engaged in July, according to USA Today.\n\n\"This chapter is closing down/ It's goodbye/ It's goodbye for us.\"\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO FOR THE SONG \u2013 WHICH WAS FILMED ON AN IPHONE - HERE:\n\nWith a clip of the song Selena tweeted: \"Thank you all for standing by my side through the highs and lows. I couldn\u2019t do it without you all and I can\u2019t wait to start my next adventure with you.\"\n\nSEE THAT TWEET HERE:\n\nThank you all for standing by my side through the highs and lows. I couldn\u2019t do it without you all and I can\u2019t wait to start my next adventure with you. ??
