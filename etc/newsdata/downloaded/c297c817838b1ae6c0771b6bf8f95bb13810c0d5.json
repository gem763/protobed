Stylistically those are all interesting match ups.\u201d\n\nAnd Sandhagen, who\u2019s looking to work on his craft, is in no rush to return to action. However, he does believe that a fight with Edgar or Cruz would make sense not just for him, but for them too if they want to get a shot at bantamweight champ Henry Cejudo.\n\n\u201cSo that leaves me with two options, either Frankie or Cruz,\u201d Sandhagen said. \u201cThey have nobody else to fight that\u2019s going to do anything for them as far as getting closer to a title. I\u2019d love to fight either one of them early next year, but I\u2019m spending the rest of my year working on new techniques and getting better. I have the long term in mind, so it\u2019s on them if they want to wait. I\u2019m doing what\u2019s going to make me the best when I start to really peak in this sport.\u201d", "description": "Cory Sandhagen eyes matchups with former champions Frankie Edgar or Dominick Cruz.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/cory-sandhagen-raphael-assuncao-ufc-241-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
