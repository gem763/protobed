An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez was stuck with the loss.\n\nHouston's victory broke Washington's eight-game winning streak in the post-season as the Astros spoiled the Nationals' chance of becoming the first team to win nine consecutive games in the playoffs.\n\nOh, how the tables turned\n\nIt's the Fall Classic and anything can happen, even if that means a 180 on one of the most vital stat lines.\n\nThe Astros entered the game struggling. They especially struggled with runners in scoring position as Houston was 3 for 17 with RISP through the first two games of the World Series. Maybe it was a change of scenery, maybe it was the 0-3 start they were staring at, but something clicked for the Astros on Friday. They were 4 for 10 with RISP at Nationals Park.\n\nInstead the Nationals were the ones left on the losing end of the battle. Washington was 7 of 21 with RISP in the first two games, but the table certainly turned and Washington came up empty. They were 0 for 10 on the night.\n\nThe Astros needed a big moment which came in a lot of smaller ones\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston was trying to avoid the dreaded 0-3 deficit that just one team of the last 18 has overturned in the World Series. In order to come away with a win on the road, the Astros needed a big moment.\n\nTheir bats had been mostly horrible leading up to Game 3. Altuve was batting .358 with five home runs in the postseason. He had three hits in Game 2. Michael Brantley has also been producing somewhat, hitting .280 in the playoffs, however after this duo things get grim. The rest of the line, including Alex Bregman, Yuli Gurriel, Yordan \u00c1lvarez and George Springer have all struggled to get hits.\n\nWhile the Astros didn't have a breakout moment, they put together a good enough effort to outlast the streaking hot Nationals.\n\nThe layoff seems to have affected An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez\n\nS\u00e1nchez had his first appearance in two weeks after starting on the mound for the Nationals on Friday.\n\nWashington was hopeful he would come out of the layoff quickly returning to form. In two starts this month, S\u00e1nchez gave up only one run on five hits with 14 strikeouts and three walks in 12 2/3 total innings.\n\nThe rested pitcher was up against Zack Greinke who made two starts since S\u00e1nchez's last outing this time around. It seemed like it would take a few innings for S\u00e1nchez to get warmed up but things didn't get off to a great start. He allowed runs in the second and third and things went downhill from there.\n\nS\u00e1nchez gave up four total runs off 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings of work. He struck out four and walked one. S\u00e1nchez was replaced in favor of Fernando Rodney after the Astros took a 4-1 lead.", "description": "The Astros are back in contention for a second World Series in three seasons after a 4-1 win over the Nationals in game three.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/f6IGtGdPq5X5UxabkJzCIQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m_gGWbEYoiBYCPYeTztl7g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/591374b8c8d3e4158617084a3806a8cb", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
