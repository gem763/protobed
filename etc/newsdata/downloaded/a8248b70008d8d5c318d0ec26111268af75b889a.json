Puskar, File)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram pickup unseated General Motors\u2019 Chevrolet Silverado as the second-best selling vehicle in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year.\n\nWith a United Auto Workers strike underway that has shut down GM\u2019s pickup production, the Ram likely will beat the Silverado for the full year for the first time, according to auto sales experts.\n\nAt the end of September, the Ram had a lead of nearly 52,000 vehicles, according to company sales figures released Wednesday. So far this year, U.S. buyers snapped up 461,115 Rams, an increase of 23% over the same time last year. GM sold 409,316 Silverados during the first nine months, down 3.6% from a year ago.\n\nFord\u2019s F-Series pickup remained the most popular vehicle in America with 662,574 sold through September, down 2.4% from a year ago.\n\nFull-size pickup trucks from the three traditional Detroit automakers are usually the top selling vehicles in America, which loves pickups. Although the places change at times on a monthly basis, normally Ford is the winner, followed by the Silverado and the Ram.\n\nBut about 49,000 GM union workers, including those who build both light- and heavy-duty pickups, went on strike Sept. 16, halting U.S. pickup truck production at factories in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Flint, Michigan. On Tuesday, a pickup plant in Silao, Mexico, had to close due to a parts shortage caused by the strike, cutting all GM pickup production .\n\nBoth sides in the contract dispute are exchanging proposals, but there\u2019s no end in sight for the strike, which is now in its 17th day.\n\n\u201cAt the current rate, it does not seem likely that the Silverado will be able to make up the sales it needs to overtake the Ram pickup,\u201d said Zo Rahim, manager of economics and industry insights for Cox Automotive.\n\nThe Ram has had strong retail sales and has performed well with commercial fleet buyers, Rahim said.\n\nGM said its pickup sales are down this year because it ran short of inventory as it switched factories over to make new versions of the light-duty and heavy-duty models. The company says Silverado retail sales to individual buyers are strong. Excluding sales to rental companies and other fleet customers, the Silverado and the GMC Sierra pickup, also made by GM, outsell Ford and Fiat Chrysler full-size pickups, the company said.\n\nOverall, GM\u2019s sales are down just under 1% for the year. Analysts say that since dealerships were well stocked before the strike began, it didn\u2019t hurt GM\u2019s third-quarter sales. But as inventories are depleted, GM\u2019s sales could start to decline if the strike lasts much longer.\n\nTotal U.S. new vehicle sales fell 1.3% during the first three quarters compared with 2018, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. Edmunds occasionally provides content to The Associated Press. Americans bought 12.77 million vehicles through September, Edmunds said.\n\nJ.D. Power and Associates expects overall sales for the full year to be around 17 million, still a healthy number but about a 1% decline from 2018 figures.\n\nAfter sales figures were released Wednesday, GM shares fell 4% to $34.66 in late-day trading.", "description": "Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram pickup unseated General Motors\u2019 Chevrolet Silverado as the second-best selling vehicle in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year.
