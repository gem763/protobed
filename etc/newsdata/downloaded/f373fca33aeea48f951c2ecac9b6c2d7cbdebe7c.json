That\u2019s what\u2019s so ridiculous about this system,\u2019 said David.\n\nWoman lied that she had been kidnapped, sexually assaulted and force-fed drugs\n\n\u2018She often does a \u201cyes\u201d with different breathing, a sound, or through her eyes. It\u2019s very subtle.\u2019\n\nThe telecare system has a microphone and a camera attached to a touch screen display, where a professional will be on the other side watching for signs of distress.\n\nIf there is an emergency they will send a response team to Ruth but the family are worried they wouldn\u2019t make it in time.\n\nRuth communicates yes or no through subtle signals like breathing which may not be picked up on a camera, say her family (Picture: David Cherry)\n\nThe family said they were told Ruth would be taking part in a trial for the new technology but were later informed her carers were being removed overnight, forcing mother Shona, 54, to move into the flat to make sure her daughter is safe.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t see a way that this was a good idea,\u2019 David continued.\n\n\u2018Even though my sister\u2019s GP, her neurosurgeon, the fire brigade and the police said this was inappropriate for Ruth and could be potentially dangerous, the council went ahead and pushed it through.\u2019\n\nMore than 330 perverts detained after arrest of one of UK's worst ever paedophiles\n\nDavid said his mum \u2018can\u2019t face leaving Ruth alone\u2019, as she often wakes in the night and sometimes in distress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he said his mother \u2013 who also cares for his epileptic father, Ian, and brother, Stuart, who has autism \u2013 was told she must not assist Ruth during the night, as it will \u2018interfere with the system\u2019.\n\n\u2018Mum has to stay in her room all night, she\u2019s not allowed to go and help,\u2019 added David.\n\nDavid (left) has launched a petition to get the decision overturned (Picture: David Cherry)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been very stressful. Mum\u2019s been sat there hearing her making noises for hours but she can\u2019t do anything. She did think about breaking it one night though when Ruth was upset.\u2019\n\nHe described it as \u2018mad\u2019 that Ruth\u2019s carers, who are her friends as well as physical support, are expected at the end of the day to hand over to a computer system with a stranger on the other end.\n\nDavid, who runs film workshops for people with additional needs, thinks the move is down to budget cuts.\n\nAlthough he \u2018sympathises\u2019 that services are incredibly stretched, he believes this \u2018isn\u2019t the way to save money\u2019 and that using computers instead of human care is \u2018setting a scary precedent\u2019.\n\nDavid is concerned his sister is being put in danger (Picture: David Cherry)\n\nA spokesperson for East Renfrewshire Health and Social Care Partnership said: \u2018The care of our residents is our absolute priority and we are always considering the best way to deliver services which suit their individual needs.\n\n\u2018The revised policy for overnight support was introduced following careful consideration, and due to significant advances in technology we can now care for people in a less intrusive and more effective way throughout the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are committed to continuing to work closely with families to ensure the best provision is in place.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
