Changes to the safety, regulatory and airspace management systems are also required to accommodate the increasing fleet of unmanned airborne systems as they take on more commercial air transport roles,\" he said.\n\n\"Aviation\u2019s most important contribution on the continent is to connect markets. In this respect, reforming Africa\u2019s air transport regulatory framework remains critical.\"\n\nHe pointed out that, unfortunately, there are differing views on the African Union\u2019s Single Africa Air Transport Market (SAATM) initiative, intended to help governments leverage sustainable economic growth by opening up and connecting trade and tourism markets with expanded air services.\n\n\"There are concerns (among some) on the impact of SAATM on their businesses. In addition some airlines and regulators fear what they see as uneven playing fields,\" said Zweigenthal.\n\n\"For airlines to be profitable, revenue must exceed costs. In Africa the revenue generated reflects the competitive state of play. Yields are generally higher on regional flights and lower for international flights. This is a result of the intense competition provided by airlines from beyond Africa.\"\n\nPaul Steele, senior vice president member and external relations at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said, in his view, aviation in Africa almost have a blank canvas. This offers a real opportunity for the industry to be flexible, but this would require both airlines and governments to make a mindset change about the benefits of something like SAATM can bring,\" said Steele.\n\n* Fin24 is a guest of AASA at its AGM.", "description": "The tragic loss of the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX this March raised serious questions \u2013 including about certification in Africa,says the CEO of the Airline Association of Southern Africa.", "authors": ["Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6578/2fadad5b1f5b4e66a90106dc2af4ec87.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
