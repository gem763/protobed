REUTERS/Stringer\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d for China\u2019s economy to grow at a rate of 6% or more because of the high base from which it was starting and the complicated international backdrop.\n\nThe world\u2019s No.2 economy faced \u201ccertain downward pressure\u201d due to slowing global growth as well as the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, Li said in an interview with Russian media which was published on the Chinese government\u2019s website, gov.cn.\n\nChina\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.3% in the first half of the year, and Li said the economy was \u201cgenerally stable\u201d in the first eight months of the year.\n\n\u201cFor China to maintain growth of 6% or more is very difficult against the current backdrop of a complicated international situation and a relatively high base, and this rate is at the forefront of the world\u2019s leading economies,\u201d Li was quoted as saying.\n\nAnalysts say China\u2019s economic growth has likely cooled further this quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% in April-June. Morgan Stanley says it is now tracking the lower end of the government\u2019s full-year target range of around 6-6.5%.\n\nIn response, the authorities have increased support, announcing on Sept. 6 a cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for the third time this year, releasing 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) in liquidity into the economy.", "description": "Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said it is \"very difficult\" for China's economy to grow at a rate of 6% or more because of the high base from which it was starting and the complicated international backdrop.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430281047&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F001", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
