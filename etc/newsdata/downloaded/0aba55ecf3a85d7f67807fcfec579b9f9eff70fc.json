The charges were upheld so far by two FIFA judicial bodies, the Court of Arbitration for Sport and Switzerland\u2019s supreme court.\n\nPlatini has challenged the Swiss federal ruling at the the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nHe says \u201cthat means I don\u2019t pay this fine\u201d while contesting the human rights case in Strasbourg in his native France.\n\nThat ongoing sense of injustice, and unpaid debt, could cause FIFA\u2019s ethics committee to impede his return.\n\nPlatini suggests: \u201cThey will try to use what they want so that I don\u2019t come back, I am sure.\u201d\n\nSoccer\u2019s world body declined to comment Monday on its rules enforcing payment of fines.\n\nFIFA did confirm that Blatter paid his fine of 50,000 Swiss francs ($50,250) first imposed in 2015.\n\nBlatter is serving a six-year FIFA ban, upheld by CAS, for authorizing an uncontracted $2-million payment to Platini in 2011. Blatter also extended his former protege\u2019s FIFA pension plan to add more than $1 million by 2015.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michel Platini is free to work in soccer again on Tuesday morning after his four-year ban by FIFA expires overnight.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Graham Dunbar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/soccer_platinis_comeback_94214_c0-211-5044-3151_s1770x1032.jpg?c122bd649662bfa6fab128664345a3a93efc659f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
