I love a good lager and anything sour. That\u2019s basically it. But I do appreciate the nuances of beer and all the accessories that make beer drinking an experience. I love the pomp and circumstance of getting a Stella chalice at a bar. With sours, the plump, bulbous tulip glasses that fill with bright pink beers make me enjoy them even more. And recently, I was introduced to these stout glasses, a peculiarly-shaped piece of drinkware designed to give you the best possible sip.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not a big stout drinker, but when the weather starts to get chilly, they\u2019re big in my household. These glasses have a slender base that helps bring out the aroma and bitterness of the stout (which can sometimes get lost in the heavy chocolate or coffee notes). The more rotund top gives the head ample space to bloom.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe all of this mumbo-jumbo, these glasses were created in collaboration with Rogue, creators of the best-selling Left Hand Milk Stout. If there\u2019s a stout drinker in your life, these make a great gift to help them appreciate all that goes into drinking a good beer. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
