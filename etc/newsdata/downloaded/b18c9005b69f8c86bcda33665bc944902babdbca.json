I follow every twist of it in Parliament and I enjoy the drama.\n\n\"I would like a career in politics. I want to get try to get in there and make a difference.\n\n\"I imagine its is very intimidating, and a lot of pressure, but I am not going to let that put me off.\"\n\nHarry, 18, a self-described left-winger, said: \"I got interested in politics through social media.\n\n\"When Brexit and Trump being elected happened there was so much more discourse about politics. Because people have such strong opinions you end up getting into it more. It feels more important.\n\n\"I like to know what I am talking about and studying politics helps with that. It is rewarding to be able to have a discussion with somebody and explain how you feel.\"\n\nTim Evans, professor of business and political economy at Middlesex University, says politics is a lot less predictable - and lot \"messier\" - than it used to be, and students do not fit neatly into categories like Leave and Remain.\n\n\"I think it's the most exciting time to study and to teach politics since the rise of the libertarian right in the 1980s and the collapse of the Soviet Union,\" he says.\n\nBut like other academics he is at pains to stress that Brexit is not the only game in town. Students are also looking to the global picture and issues such as climate change and artificial intelligence.\n\nRobert Lamb, head of politics at Exeter University, says: \"Our students have chosen to study politics because they are increasingly desperate to make sense of the tumultuous and bewildering times in which they live.\"\n\nOthers see Brexit as a narrow, parochial issue which can put young people off politics.\n\n\"The increase in interest in studying politics should not be seen only as a result of dramatic developments in British politics around Brexit but wider shifts in global politics,\" says Dibyesh Anand, Professor of International Relations and Head of the School of Social Sciences, at Westminster University.\n\n\"In fact, in our case, a very diverse student body has meant relatively tepid interest in British politics but a high interest in politics beyond Britain as well as international relations.\n\n\"To an extent, this could also illustrate a challenge British politics faces - it remains dominated by white men - and students from BME background, especially women, do not feel it is welcoming of them.\"", "description": "Brexit may be driving many to distraction - but it is boom time for university politics departments.", "authors": ["Brian Wheeler", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2C18/production/_109288211_d2e9b835-540d-41b1-9999-4eb3cb246cb9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
