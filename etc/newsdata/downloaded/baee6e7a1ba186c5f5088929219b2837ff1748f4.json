Vance Jr. His office is investigating the Trump Organization\u2019s involvement in buying the silence of two women who claimed to have had affairs with the president. In August, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office issued a grand jury subpoena to the president\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for the president\u2019s tax filings and other financial documents.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s lawyers have said the investigation is politically motivated and that the quest for his tax records from January 2011 to the present should be stopped because he is immune from any criminal probe as long as he is president.\n\nThe president\u2019s legal time immediately appealed the ruling and was granted a temporary stay of enforcement of a grand jury subpoena by the U.S. Circuit Court for the Second Circuit.\n\nPresident Trump took to social media to blast Marrero\u2019s decision, accusing Democrats and Manhattan prosecutors of political retribution.\n\n\u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump. A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump.
