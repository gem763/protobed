REUTERS/Juan Gonzalez\n\nPolice in armoured trucks watched over the gathering masses. The night before, vandals wreaked havoc nearby, looting, setting fires and sowing chaos amid a melee of sirens, protesters banging pots and heavy black smoke.\n\nPresident Sebastian Pinera\u2019s newly appointed spokeswoman Karla Rubilar condemned the previous night\u2019s mayhem, saying it did not reflect the wishes of the majority.\n\n\u201cThe violence is over-taking the legitimate demands of the social movement,\u201d Rubilar told reporters. She called on all Chileans, from soccer players to cultural icons, to reject the rioting.\n\nDays earlier, more than a million Chileans marched peacefully against inequality in Santiago, the largest protest since Chile\u2019s return to democracy in 1990.\n\nThe continuing unrest in Chile follows a week of riots, arson and protests over inequality that have resulted in at least 18 dead and 7,000 arrested, prosecutors said. Chilean businesses lost more than $1.4 billion. The city\u2019s metro suffered nearly $400 million in damages.\n\nPilar Zofoli, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, said the violence and destruction to public spaces and services was making life miserable for Santiago\u2019s working class.\n\n\u201cI support this cause, but I don\u2019t like the way things are going,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the end, this affects us, not the rich.\u201d\n\nProtests over a hike in metro fares spun out of control earlier this month, prompting Pinera to pledge sweeping social and economic reforms, and to upend his cabinet.\n\nChile, the world\u2019s top copper producer, has long boasted one of Latin America\u2019s most prosperous free-market economies. A plummeting copper price and global trade tensions, however, have dragged on the export-dependent economy and exposed entrenched inequality.\n\nSMOKE, FIRE\n\nA putrid blend of smouldering fire from an overnight blaze downtown and tear gas hung heavily over Santiago through much of Tuesday. Chileans in business attire wore makeshift masks or wet towels over their faces as they headed to and from work. Many schools and businesses remained closed, or shut early.\n\nCatalina Barrera, an 18-year-old high school student, said she felt Pinera\u2019s announcements had missed the mark. The protests would go on, she said.\n\n\u201cIf, after that massive march on Friday, we get nothing but a cabinet change in which they continue to nominate more of the same people, then violence is our only option,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nStudents, unions and other social groups have joined the Chile protests in massive numbers, but a leader or spokesperson has yet to emerge. Chile\u2019s fractured opposition parties have supported the demonstrations but have not led them, leaving a power vacuum that has hindered negotiation with the masses and left little end in sight.\n\n\u201cSo much damage, so many jobs lost, and so many people behind it all,\u201d said Ruben Saltibanez, a maintenance worker at a building partially razed in an arson attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s getting hard to take.\u201d\n\nA U.N. spokesman on Tuesday said its human rights office was very concerned by the violence and destruction, and said it would soon send a mission to Chile to investigate human rights abuses.\n\nECONOMIC IMPACT\n\nThe protests have ground Santiago to a near halt for more than a week. Rioters have looted more than 600 businesses, including many supermarkets and electronics shops. An iconic mall and shops in the mirror-windowed Costanera Center, South America\u2019s tallest building, remained closed Tuesday.\n\nChile\u2019s all-important copper and lithium mining industries had seen varying degrees of impact as of early this week.\n\nBHP (BHP.AX) told Reuters late Tuesday its Escondida copper mine, the world\u2019s largest, was operating at a reduced rate after union workers walked off the job for part of the day.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nElsewhere, copper miners said riots had otherwise mostly spared production, though continuing protests had hobbled port facilities, public transportation and supply chains, impacting operations.\n\nIndigenous protesters had for several days last week blocked access to lithium miner SQM\u2019s operations in the Atacama salt flat, one of the world\u2019s richest reserves of the ultralight battery metal.\n\nSQM declined to comment on the impacts of the blockade.", "description": "Chileans took to the streets again on Tuesday, pouring by the thousands into plazas and shutting down main boulevards in a sign that government promises of reform continued to fall short.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446334234&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1ZU", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
