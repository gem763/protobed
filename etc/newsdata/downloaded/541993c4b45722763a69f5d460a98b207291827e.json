But sleeping on the side lowers the risk even more, it says.\n\nTIPS FOR A HEALTHY PREGNANCY Pregnancy health charity Tommy's gives a list of actions which would have a positive impact on the health of a pregnancy and the future child if done before the mother stops contraception. Take folic acid Taking 400mcg of folic acid daily from two months before stopping contraception can help protect babies from developing neural tube defects such as spina bifida. Quit smoking Smoking during pregnancy causes 2,200 premature births, 5,000 miscarriages and 300 perinatal deaths per year in the UK. Be a healthy weight Being overweight before and during pregnancy increases the risk of potentially dangerous conditions such as pre-eclampsia and diabetes. Eat healthy and be active A healthy mother is more likely to give birth to a healthy baby, and both will help maintain a safe body weight. Speak to your GP if you are taking medication Some medications may affect pregnancy, and it is best to check with a GP as soon as possible Source: Tommy's\n\nTo uncover whether sleeping position affects birth weight, the scientists looked at four studies on the subject.\n\nThe position people nod off in tends to be 'maintained for the longest duration throughout the night', they wrote.\n\nOf the total 1,760 expectant mothers included in the study, 57 (3.2 per cent) said they had tended to sleep on their back during the past one-to-four weeks.\n\nResults - published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology - found these women's babies were smaller than the other infants.\n\nThis was statistically significant. However, both 'groups' of babies were still a healthy weight.\n\nThe average birth weight for newborns is around 7.5lb (3.5kg), however, between 5.5lb (2.5kg) and 10lb (4.5kg) is considered normal, according to the University of Michigan.\n\nAside from sleeping on the back, lying on the left, right or any other position was not found to have any effect.\n\nThe scientists claim this may be due to their study being relatively small.\n\nLying on the back towards the end of pregnancy is thought to compress the vena cava, the large vein that returns blood from the head to the heart, and the aorta, which carries blood to the rest of the body.\n\nThis reduces the amount of blood a woman's heart pumps out, which in turns lowers oxygen and nutrient supply to the foetus, the scientists wrote.\n\nPregnant women can easily switch their sleeping position from their back to their side, the scientists wrote.\n\nTommy's launched a Sleep On Side campaign in 2017. The scientists claim movements like this 'have the potential to increase birth size'.", "description": "Scientists from the University of Auckland asked more than 1,700 women who were at least 28 weeks pregnant about the position they had nodded off in most over the past few weeks.", "authors": ["Alexandra Thompson Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/13/19203236-0-image-a-110_1570018910403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
