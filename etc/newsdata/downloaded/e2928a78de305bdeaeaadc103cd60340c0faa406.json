Yes, if there is an election this side of Christmas, it is going to be a sprint. It\u2019s going to be hard work for all concerned.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of members locally, hundreds. The activist base is strong... the local party are totally up for the fight and we are going to throw everything at it.\n\n\u201cYes, it is a challenge but it\u2019s a challenge I relish.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This is a prime minister and an administration that is dividing and ruling.\n\n\u201cAll of his language, his whole approach, is to feed division, not to try to heal it. The broader public is beginning to realise this.\u201d\n\nThe MP said it was \u201cpatent nonsense\u201d that he was jumping ship, saying he had represented part of Wokingham borough since 2010 and had also worked as a GP in the area.\n\nOn his decision to join the Liberal Democrats, he added: \u201cThis is a party that knows it is going places and that things are changing.\n\n\u201cThe divisions between parties are changing, the borders between parties are changing, and I am a liberal conservative with a small c. They don\u2019t live in the Conservative Party any more.\u201d\n\nDr Lee is among several disaffected MPs to join the Liberal Democrats, including ex-Tories Sam Gyimah and Sarah Wollaston, and former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna, Angela Smith and Luciana Berger.\n\nHowever, his admission also caused controversy, prompting the resignation of the chair of the party\u2019s LGBT+ caucus over his record.\n\nIn 2013, Dr Lee abstained on a vote on same-sex marriage, while in 2014 he tabled an amendment to the immigration bill to demand people are tested for HIV before they can enter the UK.", "description": "Tory defector Phillip Lee will challenge arch-Brexiteer John Redwood for his Berkshire seat in an upcoming general election.
