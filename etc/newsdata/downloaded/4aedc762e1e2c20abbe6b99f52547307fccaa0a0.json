The Nightmares Fear Factory in Niagara Falls, Ont., attracts up to 600 to 800 visitors daily, while ScreamFest in Calgary \u2014 known for its haunted houses \u2014 has seen as many as 20,000 to 32,000 attendees. Even major tourist attractions like Ontario\u2019s Casa Loma and Canada\u2019s Wonderland will set up haunted houses in time for Halloween.\n\nIn BE AFRAID: The Science of Fear, a documentary from The Nature of Things, we meet Margee Kerr, a sociologist who studies fear and is an expert on haunted houses. Kerr believes that the popularity of these attractions has a lot to do with our body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight mode,\u201d when our breathing speeds up and neurotransmitters including dopamine and oxytocin \u2014 typically associated with feeling good \u2014 are released. Knowing we\u2019re not in actual danger lets us enjoy this elevated state. \u201cAfterwards, we can kind of claim the feeling of success and accomplishment that we actually did something that was truly stressful or truly threatening, and we made it,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cSurviving\u201d the experience also provides a sense of relief and grounds us in the moment. With the right kind of scare, we can leave behind the stresses of daily life, if only temporarily. So what goes into making the perfect haunted house?\n\nCreate the right conditions\n\nAccording to Kerr, when it comes to a truly thrilling experience, context is everything. \u201cTo really enjoy being afraid, we have to have some knowledge that we\u2019re not truly in danger,\u201d she says, \u201cthat we\u2019re not truly at risk of serious bodily harm.\u201d That sense of safety can be what turns a traumatic experience into an exciting one.\n\nThe perfect haunted house strikes a balance between making us feel afraid and letting us know that we\u2019ll make it out at the end. One way to do that is to make sure participants can go through the haunted house with friends or a significant other.\n\n\u201cIn those moments of intensity \u2026 we\u2019re building really layered, complex memories that include these other people, and so we come to think of them as, you know, the trusted other,\u201d says Kerr. \u201cIt becomes an incredibly powerful bonding moment.\u201d\n\nFind the perfect monsters\n\nA haunted house wouldn\u2019t be scary without monsters and ghouls, and finding the most frightening creatures can create the ideal atmosphere. According to Kerr, clowns make the \u201cperfect monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have somebody who has a painted-on smile, but their mouth is actually frowning. You can\u2019t really get an idea of what they\u2019re feeling or what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s dissonance. It\u2019s our brain saying, \u2018Is this person, you know, safe or not?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat dissonance is what\u2019s behind some other iconic horror tropes, such as defiled childhood toys. These nightmarish objects take the familiar and distort them, confusing our senses and leaving us unsettled.\n\nUse all the senses\n\nAny one of our senses can be stimulated to elicit a threat response in a haunted house. Loud noises, flashing lights, optical illusions and even things that are surprising to the touch can all disrupt our predictive processing, Kerr explains, which is how our brains make sense of and navigate the world. \u201cAnything that is surprising is going to startle people and activate the sympathetic nervous system,\u201d she adds.\n\nOur sense of smell can be especially powerful. \u201cIt\u2019s the only sense where we\u2019re actually sensing molecules from the environment that trigger the neurons to fire,\u201d says Kerr. Smell has also been found to be strongly tied to our emotions and memories, making it an evocative addition to a haunted house (like filtering a smoky scent into a creepy, burnt-out bedroom).\n\nBut haunted house designers need to be careful: our brains understand fear and disgust differently, and adding a smell that\u2019s too strong or revolting can pull people out of the experience.\n\nMORE:\n\nA single pill may be the key to overcoming many paralyzing fears\n\nKeep it new and interesting\n\nIt is possible to overdo certain scares. Our startle reflex reacts strongly to surprises, but after repeated startles, that reflex can become saturated. This means that people will actually start to tune them out as they get used to them, so in an ideal haunted house, startling effects should be spaced out.\n\nNovelty also tends to work better than taking a room or scare to its grisly extreme. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of thinking creatively about novel, different, unexpected types of set-ups,\u201d Kerr explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about engaging people and surprising [them] in unexpected ways, instead of making things more violent.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s best to skip the gore and get a little inventive instead.\n\nWatch BE AFRAID: The Science of Fear on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/BeAfraid_HauntedHouse_1920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
