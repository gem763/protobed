Every cell has six billion letters of DNA code and just one wrong letter can leave someone with a debilitating illness. \u201cThink about one misspelled word in a stack of one thousand bibles due to one wrong letter. That letter can put a boy in a wheelchair,\u201d says molecular biologist Eric Olsen.\n\nBy mapping the human genome, we now know the DNA errors that are at the root of nearly 7,000 diseases \u2014 and we can use CRISPR to fix them. The technology acts like a spell-checker, locating a specific DNA sequence, removing and replacing it.\n\nWhile this technology has the power to heal, we learn in the Nature of Things documentary The Genetic Revolution, it\u2019s changing our world in all kinds of unexpected ways.\n\nThe dawn of designer babies\n\nCRISPR has the potential to turn human reproduction on its head.\n\nFertility specialist John Zhang is at the cusp of \u201chuman engineering\u201d and has successfully used the DNA of three adults to create a three-parent baby. Since it\u2019s illegal to implant an altered human embryo into a patient in the U.S., Zhang had to travel to Mexico to perform the treatment and says, \u201cfrom this point on we know human reproductive medicine is going to change forever.\u201d\n\nWhile this method has the potential to produce a child who might otherwise suffer from a hereditary disease carried by one parent, applications could go beyond that, says Marcy Darnovsky, executive director for the Centre of Genetics and Society.\n\nBut the use of CRISPR can go further. \u201cYou get the parents who say, \u201cWell, since we\u2019ve invested this much money in making sure our child doesn\u2019t have a higher risk of breast cancer, let\u2019s also choose, whatever, hair colour, skin colour, eye colour,\u201d says Darnovsky. And Zhang agrees, \u201cI think the public will utilize the designer baby technology.\u201d\n\nThe United Kingdom recently became the first country in the world to permit the use of \u201cthree-person IVF\u201d to prevent incurable genetic diseases, so there\u2019s no doubt \u2014 more three-parent babies, and possibly designed babies, are on the way.\n\nGrowing new human organs \u2026 in pigs\n\nPablo Ross, a biologist from the University of California is conducting some cutting-edge research that he hopes has the potential to save millions of lives. Ross is placing human cells into pig and sheep embryos and hopes to combine the DNA of two species to create an almost endless supply of replacement organs for humans.\n\nIt sounds like something right out of a science fiction novel \u2014 and it is. In Oryx and Crake, Canadian author Margaret Atwood imagined a world where pigs were infused with human DNA, raised for their organs and then discarded. It didn\u2019t end well, as the \u201cpigoons\u201d became dangerous predators who devoured their human creators.\n\nFor now, in this study, the pig-human embryos are terminated at 28 days \u2014 well before birth, but Ross is hopeful for the future. \u201cPigs that nowadays are being grown to provide meat and bacon for breakfast... could also provide life-saving organs.\u201d\n\nMORE:\n\nHuman gene editing could change the world \u2014 what are the laws governing it in Canada?\n\nGenetically engineering entire populations\n\nAltering the genetic code of organisms comes with a lot of unknowns, but that hasn\u2019t stopped some scientists, like Kevin Esvelt, who leads the \u2018Sculpting Evolution\u2019 lab at MIT, from wanting to try it out on a large scale.\n\nHe is working on a technique called a \u201cgene drive\u201d, a way of editing an animal\u2019s genetic code and have changes passed down to their offspring, eventually creating a new genetically modified population. \u201cNo one had imagined that we would be able to edit entire wild species. We could get rid of all sorts of other incredible health problems,\u201d claims Esvelt.\n\nHis work has focused on eliminating Lyme disease, a bacterial infection carried by white-footed mice and transferred to humans through tick bites. A small percentage of mice are naturally immune to Lyme disease, and \u201cwe can, using CRISPR, insert that [immunity] DNA into the reproductive cells of mice, so their offspring will inherit that immunity,\u201d he says. From there, Esvelt plans to release the immune mice back into the wild, where he hopes they will reproduce and pass on their immunity, eliminating Lyme disease in the entire population.\n\nStudies are also underway to reduce the rate of malaria in mosquitoes, a disease that kills nearly half a million people each year.\n\nWhile CRISPR could bring us huge benefits, the stakes are high. Nobody wants a \u201cFranken-mouse.\u201d\n\nEsvelt, the designer of the gene drive, is wary however, and working on an \u201cundo\u201d button in case it goes wrong in the wild. Until then, he urges scientists not to use his own creation, \u201csome boxes should be left closed. More than technological power, it is wisdom we need.\u201d\n\n\n\nWatch The Genetic Revolution on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/TNOT_GenRev_roundup_1920.jpg"}
