(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nOne day after House Democrats released a resolution formalizing the ongoing impeachment inquiry process, top Senate Republicans dismissed the non-binding legislation as a stunt designed to deny President Trump \u201cdue process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have denied President Trump basic due process and are cutting his counsel out of the process in an unprecedented way. House Democrats\u2019 new resolution does not change any of that,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. \u201cThe draft resolution that has been released does nothing of the sort. It falls way short, way short.\u201d\n\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern released the impeachment resolution, which sets up procedures for the \u201cpublic-facing phase\u201d of the impeachment probe, including open hearings before the Intelligence Committee.\n\nUnder the process outlined in the resolution, Republicans on the panel will be able to request witness testimony, but Democratic committee chairmen will have the option to decline those requests.\n\nFurther along in the process, Trump and his lawyers will be allowed to question witnesses and request testimony and documents before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nA floor vote on the resolution is expected as soon as this week.\n\nHouse Democrats have for weeks been conducting closed-door hearings featuring witnesses to Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelensky, and others familiar with the recent administration of U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nRepublicans have long complained that these hearings represent a departure from the norms of due process due to their private nature and Schiff\u2019s exercise of tight control over members\u2019 time. Echoing this theme, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said Tuesday that Schiff has overseen a \u201csoviet-style\u201d process by encouraging witnesses not to answer questions from Republicans that he considers to be unfair, while allowing Democrats unfettered access to the witnesses.\n\nMcConnell took a shot at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff over this lack of transparency, arguing that the promise of a future opportunity to question witnesses and demand documents in a public setting does not change the \u201cunfair process\u201d currently unfolding in \u201cany way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are providing the administration with \u201cno due process now, maybe some later. But only if we feel like it is not a standard that should ever be applied to any American and it should not be applied here to the president of the United States,\u201d the majority leader said.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham also excoriated the House resolution on Wednesday, saying the process Democrats have embraced is \u201csubstantially different than the way we\u2019ve done it in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Intel committee is part of the process, which has never been done, and the president\u2019s counsel is not allowed to participate in the Intel committee,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a behind-closed-doors, lack-of-due-process. And they\u2019re trying to create something new that I think is just substandard and dangerous to the presidency.\u201d\n\nAll Senate Republicans except have signed onto a resolution condemning the House\u2019s impeachment process, with Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska withholding their support.", "description": "After Democrats released a resolution formalizing the ongoing impeachment inquiry process, top Senate Republicans dismissed the non-binding legislation.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Frederick M.
