Ryan Anderson had a provocative op-ed in the New York Post this weekend focusing on one of the cases they are hearing that could potentially shake up the ongoing debates over transgender identity in this country. It\u2019s the case of Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and I\u2019ve written about this one several times over the past year.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve missed it thus far, the case deals with Aimee (formerly Anthony) Stephens. For more than half a decade, Stephens worked for the funeral home as a man before announcing that he would henceforth be \u201cidentifying\u201d as a woman and dressing like one at work. After much deliberation and discussion, the funeral home determined they couldn\u2019t allow this and he was terminated. This led us to the lawsuit the Supremes will now be considering.\n\nAnderson attempts to cut through the social justice talking points and dig down to what might be the key question. Is the Supreme Court ready to embrace reality and settle this question once and for all? After all, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans discrimination based on sex, so the funeral home couldn\u2019t employ only men (or women) as funeral directors based on nothing more than that criteria. But at the same time, the Supreme Court has ruled on this question before and determined that the Constitution \u201crequires neither asexuality nor androgyny,\u201d to meet this bar.\n\nThat\u2019s why bans on sex discrimination didn\u2019t abolish sex-specific private facilities (like bathrooms), sex-specific fitness standards (for police and firefighters) or sex-specific athletic competitions (like the NBA and WNBA). After all, sex-specific bathrooms, fitness standards and sports leagues don\u2019t disfavor men or women. On the contrary, they prevent disadvantageous treatment. Forcing women to undress in locker rooms with men or to compete athletically against competitors with male muscle mass and stamina wouldn\u2019t respect equality but undermine it. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took this point for granted when she wrote the high court\u2019s majority opinion instructing the all-male Virginia Military Institute to become co-ed. She noted that going co-ed \u201cwould undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.\u201d\n\nAnderson\u2019s research is thorough and he brings up a number of valid points. Even some of the most liberal justices on the bench have gone on record in relatively recent times as recognizing the fundamental differences between men and women. They\u2019ve also spoken to the privacy issues involved in reasonable ways. But now they\u2019re being asked to fundamentally reshape the definitions of words including sex, male and female. As Anderson points out, blurring these lines to appease a radical theory being embraced by social justice warriors is harmful to actual women, particularly in competitive environments (such as sports) or where privacy issues are concerned.\n\nWhile the author makes a good case, as I\u2019ve said here before I\u2019m not at all hopeful that the Supremes are ready to tackle this subject. And Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC offers the justices the perfect escape hatch to avoid taking a stand on the underlying questions of sex versus gender. The court has been notoriously shy about tackling weighty social issues like this, the same way they\u2019ve been steering clear of sticky Second Amendment cases.\n\nThe complaint brought by Aimee Stephens offers the court the chance to deliver an extremely narrow judgment, boiling the case down to one of simply workplace discrimination based entirely on a dress code. They don\u2019t need to decide if the funeral home could fire someone based on being either a man or a woman. That\u2019s already settled law. They can\u2019t. And they don\u2019t even have to define whether or not Stephens is a man or a woman. (A decision I predict they very much won\u2019t want to make.)\n\nInstead, they could simply choose to decide whether or not the employer could fire the funeral director for wearing a professional \u201cskirt suit\u201d usually worn by ladies rather than the dress suit typically worn to the office by males. And I get the sense (based on previous workplace dress code decisions) that the EEOC will carry the day on that question. Then, no matter how narrowly they tailored their decision, transgender activists will hoist Stephens upon their shoulders and declare the ruling a great victory for transgender rights.\n\nI\u2019d love to be wrong about this one and perhaps I will.
