That's helped the sentiment but the markets still remain unconvinced,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\nMarket sentiment was still a bit jittery as news broke on Friday that Chinese officials unexpectedly cancelled a visit to U.S. farms next week following their two days of negotiations in Washington.\n\nThat led to losses in Wall Street on Friday with the Dow closing 0.6% lower, the S&P500 0.5% down and Nasdaq off 0.8%.\n\n\"There has not been any progress, at least officially, in terms of the more contentious issues,\" Catril added.\n\nAnalysts said they'd closely follow U.S.-China trade talks in coming weeks.\n\nLater in the day, September manufacturing activity surveys are due from the United States and European Union with market looking for a small rebound.\n\nIn currencies, the dollar gained a tad against the safe haven Japanese yen to 107.61. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was up 0.11%.\n\nThe euro was mostly flat as was the British pound .\n\nBrent crude futures gained on Monday, rising 1.1%, or 72 cents, to $65 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures added 1.2%, or 71 cents, to $58.80 a barrel.\n\nThe Pentagon has ordered additional troops to be deployed in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia's air and missile defences following an attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the additional troops are for \"deterrence and defence\" and Washington aimed to avoid war with Iran.\n\nBut with markets calmer since the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi Arabian refineries, gold pulled back.\n\nSpot gold was off 0.2% at $1,513.71 an ounce.\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "Wall Street stock futures edged up in early trade on Monday, setting an upbeat tone for Asian markets on hopes of an interim Sino-U.S. tariff deal after the U.S. Trade Representative characterised their two days of talks as \"productive\".
