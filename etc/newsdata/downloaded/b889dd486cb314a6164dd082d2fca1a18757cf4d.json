(Justin Lane/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nA crackling Saturday night at the U.S. Open wound up notable mostly for a crackerjack display of sportswomanship. First, No. 1 Naomi Osaka\u2019s 6-3, 6-0 win over both 15-year-old sensation Coco Gauff and the Cocomania sweeping these tennis premises proved pretty much a formality.\n\nNext came an informality laced with grace, when Osaka asked Gauff to refrain from the loser\u2019s customary quick exit and remain on court alongside Osaka for the interview normally reserved for the winner alone. Gauff, still 15 and not even yet 15\u00bd , demurred at first and feared crying in front of an audience. Osaka, 21, kept asking and suggested Gauff postpone her cry until the shower. Gauff relented and closed her remarks as rapidly as she could with, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take this moment away from her because she really deserves it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean, it was kind of instinct because when I shook her hand I saw she was kind of tearing up a little, then it reminded me how young she is,\u201d Osaka said. She said she figured that \u201cnormal people don\u2019t watch the press conferences unless they\u2019re fan-fans,\u201d and so, \u201cI was thinking it would be nice for her to address the people who watched her play.\u201d And: \u201cFor me, I just thought about what I wanted her to feel leaving the court. I wanted her to have her head high and not walk off sad.\u201d And: \u201cI feel like the amount of media on her now is kind of insane, so I just want her to take care of herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe just proved that she\u2019s a true athlete,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cFor me, the definition of an athlete is someone who on the court treats you like your worst enemy but off the court can be your best friend.\u201d\n\nAs the good feeling swirled in a stadium with two tennis families who know each other and whose fathers speak often, Osaka acknowledged Gauff\u2019s parents and teared up. Gauff\u2019s parents beamed at Osaka. Osaka \u00adfinished, Gauff exited, and Osaka applauded her.\n\nSaid Gauff: \u201cShe was crying; she won. I was crying. Everybody was crying. . . . I don\u2019t know why she was crying. I was like, \u2018You won the match!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat, she did. If anything, the 65 minutes displayed the know-how the Japanese-Haitian raised in the United States has attained in her \u00admarches to the 2018 U.S. Open title, the 2019 Australian Open title and two turns at the No. 1 ranking. Her groundstrokes proved more durable, seared more and wreaked more gasps.\n\n\u201cShe trusts her strokes a lot,\u201d Gauff said, \u201cso that\u2019s why she hits winners. In order to hit a winner, you have to trust that you\u2019re going to do it. I can work on that more.\u201d Osaka whacked 24 winners to eight for Gauff and made 17 unforced errors to Gauff\u2019s 24, yet she trimmed those errors from 12 in the first set to five in the second. She won the ace category by 5-2 and (happily) lost the double-fault department by 7-1.\n\nAs they began amid fanfare and a crowd pulling hard for the teenager, Osaka won all three first games at 30 and posted a 7-1 lead in winners to accompany her 3-0 lead all told. Gauff held serve for 3-1 with a 105-mph ace up the middle, a 119-mph ace up the middle and some hand-to-strings applause from Osaka.\n\nGauff never held serve again, going 1 for 7 in her service games. She won 42 percent of first-serve points to 74 percent for Osaka. Thus did her U.S. Open conclude along a similar impressive track as her breakthrough Wimbledon, her road ending when running up against the upgrade in caliber present in a top-10 player. At Wimbledon, it was the seventh-ranked player and eventual champion (Simona Halep, by 6-3, 6-3), and here, it was a No. 1 who has reached her first Grand Slam fourth round since her title in Australia.\n\nIt was also an occasion that brought, to the front rows at opposite ends of the court, two sets of parents with remarkable story lines.\n\nOsaka was born in Japan to a Japanese mother, Tamaki Osaka, and a Haitian father, Leonard Francois, who met in Hokkaido. The parents soon moved Naomi to Long Island, and for a blueprint of how to develop two daughters, Naomi and older sister Mari (who has reached No. 280 in the world), Francois had Richard Williams, the father of Venus and Serena Williams.\n\nGauff was raised in Florida by a former Florida State women\u2019s track heptathlete and a former Georgia State men\u2019s basketball player. Candi, her mother, was a five-time Florida high school champion and a Junior Olympic champion. Corey, her father, played on a Georgia State team that beat Stetson, Texas San \u00adAntonio and Little Rock to win its 1991 conference tournament. Then Mr. Gauff scored six points with five assists and three steals in a 117-76 loss to Nolan Richardson\u2019s powerhouse Arkansas in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nTennis has brought the two families into acquaintance, just as New York, that bastion of international meetings, brought them into Saturday night. Osaka and Gauff speak of each other amiably, and Gauff said: \u201cI mean, my dad and her dad have known each other for a long time. They always talk all the time. We\u2019ve known each other for quite a few times now. She\u2019s a great person. She\u2019s nice. Her mom is one of the nicest people ever. She\u2019s so amazing. Her whole family is just great.\u201d", "description": "The defending champion beat the 15-year-old Gauff 6-3, 6-0, to advance in New York.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf", "Some International Sports For The Washington Post.
