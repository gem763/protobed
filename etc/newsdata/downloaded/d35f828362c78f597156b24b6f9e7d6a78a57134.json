The day will end with dinner in a lavishly decorated and illuminated Rose Garden.\n\nKazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nOn a briefing call, the White House said the visit is meant to highlight the \u201cbreadth and depth\u201d of the United States\u2019 relationship with Australia, and their economic and security cooperation \u2013 specifically in regard to North Korea and Iran, as Australia recently announced their participation in joint patrols with the United States in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe leaders will also roll out a plan related to rare earth elements and minerals security, unveil new space and technology research partnerships, and discuss plastic pollution in the ocean.\n\n\u201cIt is the first [Australian] state visit that we've had since Prime Minister Howard came to the United States shortly after 9/11. And in those 18 years, the Australians have really been shoulder-to-shoulder with us all over the world in so many different areas and this is really a perfect time to highlight the alliance and the contribution,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nMorrison also plans to travel to Wapakoneta, Ohio, on Sunday to tour an Australian-owned plant with Trump.\n\nTrump and Morrison last met on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Biarritz, France.\n\n\u201cScott, he is fantastic,\u201d Trump said after their meeting.\n\nAfter a full day of work on Friday, the Morrisons, Trumps, and an exclusive list of guests will be treated to a special state dinner under the stars. At a preview, string musicians played in a row along the Colonnade and tables were set with gold plates and crystal glasses that sparkled under the lights. The first lady planned the dinner along with her social secretary, Rickie Niceta.\n\n\u201cAs the head of the executive branch, one of the president\u2019s most important roles is to conduct diplomacy with foreign nations,\u201d explained Lindsay Chervinsky, White House Historian with the White House Historical Association. \u201cState dinners provide the opportunity to highlight the role of other cultures in American life, cement existing friendships, improve tense relationships, and celebrate important treaties and agreements that improve national security and international relations.\u201d\n\nThe menu on Friday will pay \u201chomage to Australia\u2019s special blend of culinary adaptations from its various cultures,\u201d according to officials. It will feature Dover Sole, Sunchoke Ravioli and a Lady Apple Tart for dessert. Guests will be served wines from both United States and Australia, although the president, who doesn\u2019t drink, will likely sip on his preferred beverage of Diet Coke or water.\n\nGuests will also hear a performance from the largest gathering of military musicians from the United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nThere are still some details about the dinner that the first lady\u2019s office is keeping secret: The guest list and the designer of the first lady\u2019s gown won\u2019t be revealed until minutes before the dinner kicks off.", "description": "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will be the second foreign leader honored with a rare state visit to the White House since President Donald Trump took office.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-scott-morrison-file-gty-ml-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
