He said that if MPs begin the process of passing a bill Tuesday forcing the government to request an extension from European leaders in the event of no deal, it would make negotiations \u201cabsolutely impossible.\u201d In that case, government officials briefed that Johnson could call a general election for October 14.\n\nRaab said that the draft bill prepared by rebel MPs would \u201cundermine\u201d the government\u2019s prospects of getting a deal with the EU.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
