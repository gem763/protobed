This is what Prime Minister Abe confirmed with President Trump at the summit meeting,\u201d Motegi told reporters.\n\nA Japanese government statement also said further talks would seek to eliminate the existing 2.5% U.S. tariff on Japanese cars and would not result in the imposition of U.S. import quotas on Japanese autos.\n\nLighthizer, during a previous stint at USTR in the 1980s, helped negotiate voluntary export restraints on Japanese autos, which led to increased U.S. production by Japanese automakers. But Japan still exports about 1.7 million cars a year to the United States, making up about 10% of U.S. vehicle sales.\n\nWednesday\u2019s deal was met with cautious praise from farm groups and lawmakers, who said they looked forward to a more complete deal.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during a signing ceremony on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019.
