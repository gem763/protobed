Biden Jr. was making an impassioned case for protecting undocumented immigrants one recent Sunday when he abruptly stopped himself. \u201cThere\u2019s many more things, but \u2014\u201d he said before trailing off at a union forum. Minutes later, Mr. Biden interrupted himself again. \u201cSo there\u2019s a, there\u2019s \u2014 my time up?\u201d he said, echoing a line he had used when he stumbled in the first presidential debate this year. \u201cI guess not. I guess it is.\u201d\n\nThis rambling, semi-coherent style causes him problems when he veers into saying things that seem off-topic, outdated, or just plain confused. For instance, his war story in which he gets most of the details wrong. Or his record-player answer which really was a trainwreck. Or his statement that \u201cpoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d Just this month he gave an answer in which he referenced \u201cgay, gay bath houses\u201d:\n\nThe LGBTQ Town Hall went great for Biden, uh pic.twitter.com/QUjQlJI1Xg \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) October 11, 2019\n\nHe keeps doing this so often that it\u2019s impossible not to notice. And yet, based on recent polling, a lot of Democrats don\u2019t seem that concerned over it. A few even find it to be part of his charm:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s real hard to follow,\u201d Ms. Hunter, 57, said. \u201cI have a lot of concern about his ability to concentrate, his attention span, the ability to get the job done.\u201d But Patty Madden, 69, and Bev Alderson, 60, two former teachers, said Mr. Biden\u2019s informal, story-laden speaking style was part of his charm. \u201cI love it,\u201d Ms. Alderson said. \u201cIt appeals to the common people, working class, Americans, everybody!\u201d \u201cI know he falls over some of his words, we all do,\u201d Ms. Madden said. \u201cOh, big deal!\u201d Ms. Alderson interjected. \u201cHe speaks from his heart.\u201d\n\nThis is not all that different from the dynamic that seems to insulate President Trump from criticism among his supporters. Yes, he says things no other president would say, but that\u2019s because he\u2019s not concerned about political correctness. He\u2019s just speaking the blunt truth. Similarly, for Biden\u2019s people, even his gaffes are a reason to like him more.\n\nI think Biden\u2019s Democratic competitors have been going relatively easy on his gaffes thus far, in part because he\u2019s popular and in part because they like him personally. But that dynamic is changing and, if he wins the nomination, it will change dramatically when he\u2019s facing off with Trump in a debate. Trump, I suspect, would seize on these gaffes, possibly even in real-time. Then instead of politely ignoring these gaffes the media and the public will have to decide if they want to embrace them. Maybe they will but I\u2019m no convinced these statements will remain charming through next November.", "description": "\"I have a lot of concern about his ability to concentrate...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/biden-debate.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
