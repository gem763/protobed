While there are various online campaigns and efforts by various NGOs to spread awareness around ban on crackers, the onus ultimately lies with people. With a WHO report stating last year that the 14 most polluted cities in the world are in India. Kanpur topped the list, followed by Faridabad and Varanasi; Delhi came in at the sixth spot. So, it\u2019s evident that the national capital is not an isolated case. It is also clear that the scale of the problem is huge and air pollution may well be the biggest health risk facing India. So here are some common myths surrounding air pollution, which pose a greater risk. We debunk them for you:Pollutants are toxic substances emitted as a result of fuel burning. These toxins severely impact our immune system, so our body loses its strength to fight infections. So, just as smoking cigarettes will not make you immune to lung cancer and consuming arsenic will not make you immune to poisoning, breathing in polluted air will only make your respiratory organs weaker. This in turn may lead to asthma, lung cancer, COPD and even heart attacks.As per the EPA guidebook for indoor air quality, indoor air is often as bad as, and sometimes worse than outdoor air. Multiple sources within homes and work spaces, that may not have a significant impact individually, cumulatively can pose a serious risk, especially considering that we all spend a majority of our time indoors\u2013either at home or at work. Cooking, burning incense and candles, using perfumed sprays and deodorants and smoking indoors reduce indoor air quality. Work spaces may also have a higher degree of VOC\u2019s from furniture and paints.Air quality in many cities of India (10 out of 20 of the most polluted cities globally are in India - WHO) far exceeds the AQI standards prescribed by the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) throughout the year. A Greenpeace report that studied air quality in every Indian state throughout the year, showed PM, ozone and nitrogen-oxide levels constantly higher than the annual average prescribed by CPCB throughout the year. Grey skies are only more visible in the winter months, owing to the phenomenon of inversion.These masks will not stop you from inhaling harmful air pollutants. A typical half-face surgical mask has a pore size of around 5-10 micrometre, whereas the pollutants that pose maximum health risks for humans are of 2.5 micrometres or less. Moreover, such masks rarely cover the nose and mouth completely providing enough gap for pollutants to percolate freely, especially from sides.Each of us can make a difference. Changing our own behaviour such as keeping cars and bikes well-tuned, adopting greener fuels like petrol instead of diesel that have lower emissions, segregating and composting our waste, car-pooling and using public transport can help us reduce our own carbon footprint. By reporting waste burning and cars emitting black fumes to authorities, and driving awareness in our own communities we can make wider impact to help reduce air pollution in our neighbourhoods.Air pollution is caused due to toxic substances. These when inhaled enter the blood stream and weaken the immune system, making us more susceptible to respiratory and coronary illnesses. So even people who are perfectly healthy can develop respiratory problems when exposed to air pollution for an extended period of time. WHO in its report also highlighted that air pollution is responsible for causing an estimated one-quarter (24%) of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25% from stroke, 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29% from lung cancer.", "description": "From wearing surgical masks to staying indoors, we look at some common air pollution myths and debunk them", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/delhi-sm-thumb1571813571.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
