Instead, he told The Telegraph, \u201cit\u2019s more about the inefficiency of the whole system\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s full of inefficiencies, with charities applying for different funding from different places. It\u2019s unfortunately just the way this sector works. There\u2019s no individual entity which is responsible for this, it needs technology to help make it more efficient.\u201d", "description": "Charities are spending \u00a31.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social", "Religious Affairs Editor", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/07/03/Charity-donation-box-008-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYh_8IBLdAWMRn6BKLOqynKISCJilmQGoDZwrXpMQ-co.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
