The company says he decided not to renew his contract. SAP Executive Board members Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein have been appointed co-CEOs.\n\nMcDermott, who started his business career as a deli owner in Amityville, Long Island and recently spoke at our TechCrunch Sessions: Enterprise event, joined SAP in 2002 as the head of SAP North America. He became co-CEO, together with SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, in 2008 and the company\u2019s sole CEO in 2014, making him the first American to take on this role at the German enterprise giant. Under his guidance, SAP\u2019s annual revenue and stock price continued to increase.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McDermott decided to step down at this point. Activist investor Elliott Management recently disclosed a $1.35 billion stake in SAP, but when asked for a comment about today\u2019s news, an Elliott spokesperson told us that it didn\u2019t have any \u201cimmediate comment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the company saw a number of defections among its executive ranks in recent months, with both SAP SuccessFactors COO Brigette McInnis-Day and Robert Enslin, the president of its cloud business and a board member, leaving the company for Google Cloud.\n\n\u201cSAP would not be what it is today without Bill McDermott,\u201d said Plattner in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cBill made invaluable contributions to this company and he was a main driver of SAP\u2019s transition to the cloud, which will fuel our growth for many years to come. We thank him for everything he has done for SAP. We also congratulate Jennifer and Christian for this opportunity to build on the strong foundation we have for the future of SAP. Bill and I made the decision over a year ago to expand Jennifer and Christian\u2019s roles as part of a long-term process to develop them as our next generation of leaders. We are confident in their vision and capabilities as we take SAP to its next phase of growth and innovation.\u201d\n\nMcDermott\u2019s biggest bet in recent years came with the acquisition of Qualtrics for $8 billion. At our event last month, McDermott compared this acquisition to Apple\u2019s acquisition of Next and Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram. \u201cQualtrics is to SAP what those M&A moves were to those wonderful companies,\u201d he said. Under his leadership, SAP also acquired corporate expense and travel management company Concur for $8.3 billion and SuccessFactors for $3.4 billion.\n\n\u201cNow is the moment for everyone to begin an exciting new chapter, and I am confident that Jennifer and Christian will do an outstanding job,\u201d McDermott said in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cI look forward to supporting them as they finish 2019 and lay the foundation for 2020 and beyond. To every customer, partner, shareholder and colleague who invested their trust in SAP, I can only relay my heartfelt gratitude and enduring respect.\u201d\n\nUpdating\u2026", "description": "SAP today announced that Bill McDermott, its CEO for the last nine years, is stepping down immediately.
