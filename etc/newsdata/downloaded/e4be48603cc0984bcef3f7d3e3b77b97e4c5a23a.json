There is no antidote or vaccine and the only known way to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of affected livestock.\n\nThe second and third cases in the South were also reported from cities in Gyeonggi Province, where Paju is situated and is adjacent to the inter-Korean border.\n\nWhile Seoul authorities have never confirmed whether the outbreak stemmed from the North, Pyongyang in late May told the World Organisation for Animal Health that dozens of pigs had died from the disease at a farm near the Chinese border.\n\nIn June, Seoul said the disease was \"highly likely\" to enter the country from the North and ordered fences to be erected at farms along the border to prevent possible contact between pigs and wild boar.\n\n- No antidote -\n\nKim Jun-young, a vet and a vice president of the Korean Veterinary Medical Association in the South, said it was possible the outbreak had spread to all provinces in the isolated North.\n\n\"North Korea does not have enough disinfectants, and (it is likely that) pigs are simply being buried after being culled,\" Kim said.\n\n\"It's possible that the virus has already been spread to all regions of the North if anyone dug the bodies of dead pigs and sold the meat, or... vultures ate them and spread the virus.\"\n\nThere are around 6,700 pig farms across South Korea and pig farming accounts for 40 percent of the total livestock industry.\n\nSeoul believes Pyongyang raises some 2.6 million pigs across 14 state-run farms. The outbreak could worsen food shortages in the impoverished North, where, according to the World Food Programme, its output last year hit the lowest level since 2008.\n\nIn May, the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization said pork prices had risen by up to 50 percent both in China and on the Chicago futures exchange as a result of the outbreak of African Swine Fever which was first detected in Asia in August last year.\n\nLast month, it said almost five million pigs in Asia had died or been culled because of the spread of the disease.", "description": "South Korea confirmed its fourth case of African swine fever on Tuesday, as Pyongyang was yet to respond to Seoul's request to make joint efforts to tackle the deadly animal disease.
