His mother Dr Anna Murrett (left) said she had never heard of it\n\nThe Citibank worker's housemates were away for the weekend, and nobody knew he died until he didn't show up for work the following Monday.\n\nHis mother, Dr Anny Marrett, said he hadn't been sleeping well in the lead up to his death.\n\n'He'd been at a party and he'd come home late; he'd had a few drinks. He might not have taken his medication dose before the party,' the GP told news.com.au.\n\n'A friend called him around lunch to ask him for golf but he turned it down because he was too tired. We think a combination of lack of sleep, missing tablets and having a few drinks possibly contributed to his death.'\n\nDr Marrett received the heartbreaking news on Monday morning, after her son failed to show up to work.\n\n'I'm a GP but I hadn't heard of the condition, I'm ashamed to say. There's more awareness about SIDS,' she said.\n\nThe 29-year-old's (pictured) housemates were away for the weekend, and nobody knew he died until he didn't show up for work the following Monday\n\nThere are roughly 300 epilepsy-related deaths in Australia every year, with around half of those stemming from SUDEP.\n\nThe rare condition occurs in around one in every 1,000 Australians with epilepsy.\n\nIn most cases, the person is found to have passed away in bed while they were asleep.", "description": "George Murrett, 29, from Sydney, died in his sleep from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy - the unexpected death of a person with epilepsy, where no reason for the death is found.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/09/20074070-0-image-a-17_1571819263559.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
