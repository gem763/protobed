D'Arnoud lofted a pinch-hit sacrifice fly that scored pinch-runner Michael Brosseau and broke a 3-3 tie. Robertson, whose double had tied the game in the seventh, hit a single off Ryan Tepera that drove in Kiermaier with an insurance run.\n\nNick Anderson (5-4) got the win and Oliver Drake struck out three straight for his second save in three tries for the Rays, who are battling Oakland and Cleveland for the American League wild-card spots.\n\nJays falter despite Kay's strong outing\n\nThe Blue Jays lost their six straight despite a strong outing by Anthony Kay in his major league debut.\n\nConsecutive singles by Avisail Garcia, Tommy Pham and Austin Meadows produced Tampa Bay's first run off Kay in the fourth inning, and the rookie walked in another run. But Kay struck out Kiermaier and Mike Zunino with the bases loaded, thwarting a possible big inning by the Rays.\n\nThe 24-year-old left-hander, acquired from the New York Mets in the Marcus Stroman trade of July 28, gave up four hits and three walks while striking out eight in 5 2/3 innings.\n\n\"He's a bulldog on the mound. He pitches inside, he changes speeds. He did a great job,\" said Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo. \"Eight strikeouts against a good lineup. He was awesome. I wanted to say 'wow' and he was wow.\"\n\nKay became the 19th starting pitcher used by the Blue Jays this season, tied for second-most in American League history behind the 24 used in 1915 by the Philadelphia Athletics.\n\n\"It hasn't sunk in fully yet,\" Kay said. \"Just having my friends and family here, I think, makes it the most special. It was really cool.\"\n\nRays starter Charlie Morton was dominant until the sixth, when he gave up four hits and a walk. Bases-loaded singles by Reese McGuire and Jonathan Davis drove in two runs, and Billy McKinney drove in a third with a 400-foot fly ball, giving Toronto a 3-2 lead before Morton finished his outing with his 10th strikeout.\n\nMorton went six innings, reaching a career high of 176 1/3 innings in his 30th start. He gave up three runs on five hits and three walks.", "description": "Travis d'Arnaud and Daniel Robertson drove in runs with two outs in the eighth inning, helping the Tampa Bay Rays to a 5-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275111.1567907010!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/blue-jays-rays-baseball.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
