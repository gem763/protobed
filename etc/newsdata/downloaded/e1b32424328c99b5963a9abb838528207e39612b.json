They have sunk what little is left of their money into their studio in a last-ditch effort to stay on The Block.\n\nWithout the $10,000 prize money, they will be heading home to Cairns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows what it is like to be in our shoes,\u201d Tess said, wiping away her tears.\n\n\u201cI know they\u2019ve done The Block before, but no-one has done it this size before. No-one has been told you are not going to finish from day one.\u201d\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t shed any tears on camera, it was clear that Luke was devastated by the news.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating to come all the way down here and not finish the job that you set out to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have so many more big plans for this place, but we have absolutely no money left to do that now.\u201d\n\nAs Tess and Luke threw everything they had at their studio, there were some who took smug pleasure in their downfall. Cam took great delight in spreading the news of Tess and Luke\u2019s demise to the other households, using their grim tale as a warning to others to be more frugal.\n\nMeanwhile, Dan and Keith kept telling all who would listen that the honeymooners were putting in the hard yards too late in the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I have seen Tess in there helping out. It\u2019s great to see. But it\u2019s 71 days too late,\u201d Dan remarked smugly.\n\n\u201cThey should\u2019ve been doing this since day one. This is why they have no money. That\u2019s what couples have to do. It\u2019s too little, too late!\u201d\n\nThere was certainly no sympathy for the couple\u2019s situation from neighbours turned nemesis Mitch and Mark.\n\n\u201cTess and Luke have to take responsibility for how they manage their budget and their spend,\u201d Mark said. \u201cWe all started in the same place. We all started in the same building and with the same budget.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s fair to say Mitch and Mark\u2019s decision to pull their plasterers had left Tess and Luke high and dry. They quickly fell behind the other teams when they couldn\u2019t find a new crew to plaster their walls. No sooner had they finally locked in a team than they were forced to cancel them after their apartment was hit by an overnight storm.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Tess and Luke who were affected by the downpour. All three cash-strapped teams bore the brunt of storm damage due to leaks in their unfinished roofs.\n\nEl\u2019ise and Matt had to completely re-do their en suite due to rain damage. With the well dry of funds, there was nothing the couple could do to speed up the process and get back on track except weep (El\u2019ise) and let fly with a string of expletives (Matt).\n\nIt was a similar story over at Andy and Deb\u2019s place (without the tears and tirades) because the comedian, typically, tried to find the funny side in the setback.\n\nLuckily for all three couples, the show\u2019s producers decided to cover any damage costs to their rooms (given it was their shoddy roofing that caused the problem), plus foreman Keith arranged additional workers (free of cost) to help carry out the repairs.\n\nDan also turned up with some McCaf\u00e9 refreshments (and $5000) for El\u2019ise and Matt.\n\nWhy? Supposedly to reward them for hard work, but it\u2019s more likely the producers are desperate to find ways to keep the cash-strapped teams going until auction day.\n\nAmid all this pressure to complete the biggest room in their properties on a shoestring and in wild weather, the teams were once again pulled off site for a challenge.\n\nThis time they were given $3500 and 6.5 hours to renovate and landscape five small properties for homeless people. They were given the added task of styling the houses to match the Colorbond steel used to build them. Because who doesn\u2019t match their bed linen to their home\u2019s structural steel framework?\n\nIt is somewhat ironic that the contestants have been set a challenge aimed at providing safe and attractive accommodation homeless people.\n\nAfter all, last year The Block came under fire for converting The Gatwick, a boarding house for homeless people, into a luxury complex. Locals worried about the flow-on effect to the local area in displacing so many homeless people.\n\nThis year they have repeated the same move in renovating The Oslo, a building which also provided a haven for many of the suburb\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nIt was nice to see the top-rating show giving something back. And, of course, that fact wasn\u2019t lost on saintly Deb.\n\n\u201cYes, everyone wants to win the $5000 but when you feel like you\u2019ve contributed \u2014 even just a little bit \u2014 to something like that it\u2019s awesome,\u201d she commented.\n\nJesse and Mel took out the win because they managed to create an interior that included a living, dining and bedroom space. The other four teams managed to squeeze in only two of the three. It marks the couple\u2019s third straight win.\n\nAnd nobody was happy to see that bar Jesse and Mel \u2014 and, of course, the producers!\n\nGame on. Or should that be, game over?", "description": "Tess and Luke have finally run out of money, and everyone from Scott Cam to Mark and Mitch are kicking them when they\u2019re down.", "authors": ["Siobhan Duck"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10204531/capi_8457633aff3fa71ae5f67d44bce71031_1841bde5dbcf6c29a5f5be657b48dfe6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
