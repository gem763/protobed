Coproduced by DreamWorks Animation and China-based Pearl Studio, the animated film follows the adventures of Everest, a yeti longing to return to his mountain home, and Yi, the Chinese girl committed to getting him there. At one point in the film, a map of the South China Sea is shown bearing the \u201cnine-dash line,\u201d a boundary China has unilaterally declared to lay claim to most of the sea. However, parts of that same body of water are claimed by Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan, and the movie\u2019s decision to depict that line of demarkation has lead to a growing release nightmare for the film.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s censorship board initially agreed to permit Abominable to premiere on November 7, if the image of the map was removed from the version screening in their country. However, Universal Studios, which is distributing the film everywhere but China (Pearl Studio is Abominable\u2019s Chinese distributor) has refused to make the cut. \u201cUniversal has decided not to make the censor cut required by the Malaysian censor board and as such will not be able to release the film in Malaysia,\u201d a spokeswoman told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, Vietnam pulled the film from theaters over the same scene on October 14, ten days after its release in the country, with the Philippines following suit soon after. Back in 2016, an international tribunal at the Hague determined China had no legal standing to claim rights to most of the South China Sea. China subsequently rejected the ruling.", "description": "Malaysia joins Vietnam and the Philippines in banning the DreamWorks-Pearl Studio film Abominable over its depiction of China\u2019s unilateral claim to the South China Sea, demarcated by the nine-dash line.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/20-Abominable-Controversy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
