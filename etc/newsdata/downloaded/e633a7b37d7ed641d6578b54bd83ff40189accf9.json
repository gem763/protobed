And we let them off the hook.\u201d\n\nStock-market investors may be sharing that sentiment after seemingly having victory in sight on Tuesday like the Arizona Cardinals then-coached by Green back in 2006.\n\nBut there may be hope yet for Wall Street.\n\nEarly Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.28% was boasting a nearly 130-point gain, and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.23% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.13% were enjoying a healthy start to a month that has been known for its turbulent streak.\n\nHowever, after the weakest manufacturing report in about a decade, the investment mood was shattered. All three benchmarks finished with declines of at least 1% and the Dow and S&P 500 notched their worst daily losses since Aug. 23, according to FactSet data.\n\nThat said, the analyst at Bespoke Investment Group say that a weak start to October doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all is lost for the remainder of the month and year.\n\nThere have been 14 trading days in which the S&P 500 has fallen by at least 1% in the first trading day in October. But, the S&P has gained an average of 3.75% for the rest of October when it has had such a start and has finished positive in the remaining three months after a 1% decline to start the month, boasting an average gain of 7.2% for the quarter.\n\n\u201cBulls would certainly take a 1% decline today if it meant 7%+ gains through year-end compared to the average gain of 2.43% for all years,\u201d Bespoke wrote on Tuesday (see the table below).\n\nOctober has notoriously been a rough stretch for equity indexes, marked by the stock-market plunge that led to the 1929 Great Depression, the 1987 crash and the 2007-\u201908 financial crisis, prompting Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac to refer to the month as the \u201cjinx month\u201d for equities.\n\nBut in this case, maybe Tuesday\u2019s reminder that October is fraught for investors means that all the bearishness is out of Wall Street\u2019s system.\n\nBespoke cautions, however, not to get too carried away with optimism that their data may imply:\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t to suggest that markets are going to be free and clear for the rest of the year, but it goes to show that bad starts to Q4 aren\u2019t the end of the world either,\u201d Bespoke\u2019s analysts write.\n\nRead: The stock market just delivered a reminder about October volatility as Dow, S&P 500 wipe out third-quarter gains\n\nAll of this action puts the onus on Friday\u2019s jobs report to demonstrate that the wheels aren\u2019t entirely coming off U.S. economic expansion in its history-setting 11th year.", "description": "October is what we thought it was!
