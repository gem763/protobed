REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer\n\nGermany\u2019s export-reliant economy is suffering from weaker foreign demand and business uncertainty caused by trade disputes and Britain\u2019s planned but delayed exit from the European Union.\n\nContracts for \u2018Made in Germany\u2019 goods were down 2.7% from the previous month, driven by a big drop in bookings from non-euro zone countries, the economy ministry said. That undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a 1.5% drop.\n\nThe reading for June was revised up to an increase of 2.7 from a previously reported 2.5% increase.\n\n\u201cOverall, new orders in the manufacturing sector had a weak start to the third quarter,\u201d the ministry said.\n\n\u201cIn light of still unresolved international trade conflicts and muted business expectations in manufacturing, there are still no signs of a fundamental improvement in the industrial sector in the coming months,\u201d the ministry added.\n\nOrders from non-euro zone countries plunged nearly 7% on the month while demand from other euro zone countries and domestic bookings rose slightly, the data showed.\n\nWithout the distorting effects of bulk orders, industrial orders rose 0.5% on the month in July, the ministry added.\n\n\u201cThe misery in manufacturing continues. The decline in new orders significantly increases the risk of a recession for the German economy,\u201d VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.\n\nThe German economy contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter on weaker exports, with the drop in foreign sales mainly driven by Britain.\n\n\u201cThe danger is great that negative growth will also be recorded in the third quarter,\u201d Gitzel added.", "description": "German industrial orders fell more than expected in July on weak demand from abroad, data showed on Thursday, suggesting that struggling manufacturers could tip Europe's biggest economy into a recession in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426436549&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840G2", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
