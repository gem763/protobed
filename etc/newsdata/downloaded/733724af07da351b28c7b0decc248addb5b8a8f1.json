(for Now)", "language": "en", "text": "The president claimed the credit for Mr. Bishop\u2019s success and for that of the Republican Greg Murphy, who won in North Carolina\u2019s Third District. In his Thursday speech, Mr. Trump boasted that he\u2019d rallied voters \u201clike no one has ever seen.\u201d He promised to do the same next year in dozens of House races. \u201cI got a lot of energy!\u201d he said.\n\nAgain and again, he hit the same note: Stick by me, and there will be so much winning.\n\nWary of intraparty drama that could complicate the president\u2019s re-election, his campaign team has been working for months to smooth the way. In four states, Republicans are canceling their presidential primaries and caucuses. While not unprecedented, the move is seen as part of a broader attempt to choke off any primary challenges. Mr. Trump currently has three Republican challengers \u2014 all extreme long shots.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is doing his best to make the Republican Party his own personal club,\u201d complained one of the contenders, Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s something a mob boss would do,\u201d said another, former Representative Joe Walsh.\n\nEvery president appropriates his party\u2019s election apparatus for his own ends, but the Trump team is absorbing the infrastructure entirely. In December, the campaign made public that it was formally merging key operations with the Republican National Committee to create a single entity, called Trump Victory. A primary goal, Politico reported at the time, was to limit staff overlap \u201cand the kind of infighting that marked the 2016 relationship between the Trump campaign and the party.\u201d\n\nAdvisers have also been working overtime to make sure there is no whiff of dissent at next summer\u2019s nominating convention, as there was in 2016.\n\nThis streamlining comes with risks \u2014 at least for those not named Trump. This week, an investigation by ProPublica revealed that the R.N.C. has been withholding data from down-ballot candidates about how voters in particular states and districts view the president. Why? Party insiders suggested it was to prevent candidates in places where Mr. Trump isn\u2019t especially popular from attempting to distance themselves from him or from leaking data that could embarrass him. This could complicate the strategies of Republicans running in tough swing districts.\n\nMichael Steele, the R.N.C.\u2019s former chairman and a Trump critic, told ProPublica the committee no longer asks candidates, \u201cWhat do you need?\" The question, he said, is, \u201cDo you support Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nThough he dominates his party today, this question clearly continues to gnaw at the president.", "description": "Why is the president so obsessed with party loyalty?", "authors": ["Michelle Cottle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/opinion/13gop/13gop-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
