Quarterback Matt Ryan had been hounded all day and knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter with ankle and foot injuries. His defense, already the NFL\u2019s worst in most statistical categories, was torched again.\n\nAnd special teams utterly fell apart - missing a field goal, allowing a fake punt, giving up a long punt return, botching an onside kick and fumbling away a punt for a touchdown.\n\nYet despite the latest evidence, Quinn said he didn\u2019t think the season, at 1-6, is entirely lost. His teams have dropped 11 of their past 15 games and have almost no hope of turning this season around.\n\n\u201cI never think you\u2019re out of the fight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t think that way as a team member, and I certainly don\u2019t think that way as a coach. I recognize that when you don\u2019t play well, those are fair questions, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever out of the fight.\u201d\n\nQuinn, who led Atlanta to the 2016 NFC title, insisted he\u2019s still the right choice for the job and added he has no plans to step aside as defensive coordinator, a role he assumed after last season.\n\nBut he looked like a man out of answers as he stepped down from the podium and over a few steps where Falcons owner Arthur Blank waited to give him a big hug. Blank said after huddling briefly with Quinn that he has no immediate plans to make a change and fire the coach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing for everybody,\u201d Blank said. \u201cWe understand that it is.\u201d\n\nDuring the team\u2019s stay in Arizona two weeks ago, Quinn made some adjustments in defensive play-calling, appointing some of his assistants to help out during games and allow him to concentrate more on the big picture.\n\nNothing has worked. The Falcons have lost five straight and have another tough assignment next week against contending Seattle.\n\nPlayers have said throughout the season that they are to blame for not executing the game plan, and defensive end Vic Beasley said that was the case again this time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tough,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cWe definitely feel like we put a lot of time in each and every week and we definitely feel like we have the players to go out there and win, but it just ain\u2019t happening for us right now.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons allowed five sacks, as many as their defense has registered all year. They trailed by double digits at halftime for the fifth time and have been outscored by an aggregate 120-50 in the first half.\n\nDevonta Freeman finally snapped in frustration early in the third quarter and was ejected for throwing a punch at Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald. Freeman\u2019s departure left Atlanta with third-stringer Brian Hill and return specialist Kenjon Barner at running back. Top reserve Ito Smith was carted off the field at the end of the first quarter with head and neck injuries.\n\nQuinn will take the only course of action he knows, getting everyone back together Monday at team headquarters to dissect the latest loss.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it still counts on the performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you look to and when you\u2019re not meeting it, there\u2019s lots of reasons. That\u2019s why I try to spend most of my time saying, \u2018OK, how do we make sure all three phases can get connected to do it?\u2019 But you don\u2019t hit in one area, two areas or all three, you want to keep digging for the answers. It\u2019s definitely frustrating.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dan Quinn's job security keeps taking hits, and this week was no exception.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/rams_falcons_football_76586_c0-212-2400-1612_s1200x700.jpg?ce689c71fffe6641aadef7419fc56a081eaa4480", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
