The time has come to close them.\u201d\n\nBut the move has been bitterly opposed by the dictator\u2019s family and admirers. In June this year, just days before Franco\u2019s body was due to be dug up, the supreme court ordered the exhumation to be suspended while it considered an appeal from his family and other groups.\n\nThree months on, the court is due to reveal its ruling on whether the government can proceed with the removal of the valley\u2019s most famous occupant.\n\nThe hulking monument, which was partly built by captured republicans and political prisoners, is a mass grave containing the remains of more than 30,000 people who fought on both sides of the war.\n\nThe end of the Spanish civil war - archive, 1939 Read more\n\nAlthough supposedly a memorial to all those killed in the conflict, only two graves are marked: Franco\u2019s and that of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falangist party.\n\nThe Francisco Franco Foundation, which exists to promote and preserve the fascist dictator\u2019s legacy \u2013 and which was also part of the legal challenge \u2013 is already weighing up its next moves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident in the strength of our arguments,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s president, Juan Chicharro Ortega.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens but the signs and media leaks may suggest that the supreme court will approve the exhumation order.\u201d\n\nTimeline Spain heads for fourth election in four years Show Hide 2015 general election Voter anger over economic woes and corruptions scandals leaders to a hung parliament. The two main parties - the ruling People\u2019s party (PP) and the Socialists (PSOE) - suffer big loses at the expense of newcomers (leftwing) Podemos and (rightwing) Ciudadanos. Neither the PP nor the PSOE manage to secure a majority in parliament to form a new government, so \u2026 2016 General election \u2026 another election is held in June. Voter turnout is the lowest since the transition to democracy in 1975. The PP\u2019s vote share increases, but parliamentary deadlock continues. PSOE leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez refuses to allow PP leader Mariano Rajoy to form a minority government, citing the corruption scandals swirling around the PP. S\u00e1nchez resigns Years of simmering discontent among PSOE members with S\u00e1nchez boil over and he is ousted as leader after powerful factions rebel against his refusal to allow Rajoy to form a government. Rajoy secures role as PM With S\u00e1nchez gone, the political paralysis is broken and Rajoy returns as PM after the PSOE abstains on an investiture vote in parliament. S\u00e1nchez re-elected as PSOE leader S\u00e1nchez regains the leadership of the still-divided PSOE, his hardline anti-Rajoy stance bolstered by a slew of corruption scandals involving former senior PP figures in Madrid\u2019s regional government. Rajoy testifies in court Rajoy becomes the first serving Spanish PM to testify in a criminal case. He emphatically denied any knowledge of an illegal funding racket in the PP. Cifuentes scandal The president of Madrid\u2019s regional government, PP's Cristina Cifuentes, resigns after video footage emerged of her apparently being caught stealing two tubs of face cream seven years previously. Rajoy had refused to heed calls to sack Cifuentes after an earlier scandal involving false claims about her academic qualifications. S\u00e1nchez becomes PM The PSOE calls a vote of no confidence in the scandal-plagued Rajoy administration, and it passes through parliament with the help of regional parties and Podemos. S\u00e1nchez is sworn in as PM the next day. Budget impasse S\u00e1nchez is unable to get his 2019 budget passed through parliament after the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties who had supported him against Rajoy vote against it. Yet another election is called. 2019 general election Another inconclusive election sees the PSOE increases its vote share, as the PP vote plummets and the far-right Vox party enters parliament for the first time. Speculation immediately turns to how the PSOE will secure the majority needed to form a government. Fresh elections loom again S\u00e1nchez\u2019s efforts to put together a government are hobbled by the refusal of the Citizens party to countenance a pact with the PSOE, and by the socialists\u2019 own firm veto on entering a coalition with Unidas-Podemos. If an agreement is not reached by 23 September a new general election will be held on 10 November.\n\nHowever, Ortega believes that even if the body is exhumed, the move could yet backfire on the PSOE.\n\nIt has been suggested that Franco could be reinterred next to his wife in her mausoleum in the Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery near Madrid. But the Franco family said that if the body is dug up, it ought to be reburied in the family crypt in the Almudena cathedral, which stands in the centre of the capital.\n\n\u201cMr S\u00e1nchez may win a partial victory by getting the general\u00edsimo out of the Valley of the Fallen, but how\u2019s he going to explain it all if he ends up in the Almudena cathedral of all places?\u201d said Ortega. \u201cIt\u2019ll be much easier and closer for people who want to come and lay flowers.\u201d\n\nThe Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH), which works to find and excavate the bodies of those killed during the civil war and buried in mass graves, says it is high time Franco left the valley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very democratic for a country to spend public money on the upkeep of a dictator\u2019s tomb,\u201d said the association\u2019s president, Emilio Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect metaphor for the impunity of the dictatorship.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the tens of thousands of bodies now lying in valley had been \u201ckidnapped\u201d from their original resting places around Spain after the regime decided that the site should house both the nationalist and republican dead and serve as a monument to national reconciliation.\n\n\u201cNo government has ever wanted the door of the valley to open so that they can come out of there,\u201d said Silva.\n\nTime, he added, was running out for all those elderly Spaniards who want to retrieve the remains of the relatives they lost in the civil war and rebury them before they themselves die.\n\nDespite all the talk of the wounds of the past, the court\u2019s decision could have a very contemporary impact as Spain prepares for its fourth general election in as many years.\n\nAlthough the PSOE won the most votes in April\u2019s vote, the party fell short of a majority. Attempts to form a government came to nothing over recent months and another election will be held on 10 November.\n\n\u201cIf the court says on Tuesday that they can get him out \u2013 and if the government does \u2013 that could provoke a certain reaction from the far-right that could mobilise the PSOE vote,\u201d said Silva.\n\nWhatever happens, however, the ARMH doesn\u2019t want to see Franco moved from the valley to Mingorrubio-El Pardo as the cemetery is owned by the state and funded from the public purse.\n\n\u201cIf the government allows him to end up in the Almudena cathedral in the middle of Madrid, it\u2019ll be a symptom of political and democratic weakness,\u201dadded Silva.\n\n\u201cBut what we don\u2019t want is to keep seeing our taxes used to maintain his tomb, which is what\u2019s happened ever since we returned to democracy.\u201d", "description": "Fascist dictator\u2019s remains likely to be removed from Valley of the Fallen, but next destination can prove controversial", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02eca7b9a2f8a86bcb260f30d2e7bd238b0dbb2d/0_62_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=87f214120ea370c0db532348a5d08000", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
