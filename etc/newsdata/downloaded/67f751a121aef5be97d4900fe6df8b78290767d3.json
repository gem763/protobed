It was ever thus.\n\nDavid Black, leaning over the counter of a hardware store in Fivemiletown, just north of the border in County Tyrone, said: \u201cIt\u2019s Northern Ireland. Nobody wants us anyway, not in London or Dublin. We\u2019re just the scapegoat. People are just fed up.\u201d\n\nBrian Johnston, who has a shop 12 miles (19km) away in Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh \u2013 which has a heavily fortified police station as an ugly reminder of the past \u2013 said: \u201cThe people that are impacted the most from Brexit are people on the border. But they don\u2019t talk to us about it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leanne Thompson is a dairy farmer on the Irish border.

It is too close. Buyers were saying they would like to buy, but they didn\u2019t want to risk living at the border.\u201d\n\nThe complex area of frontier between the Irish counties of Monaghan and Cavan and the Northern Irish counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone zigs and zags in a horseshoe shape.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for us is the border \u2013 can we travel? Politicians just don\u2019t understand what life is like here,\u201d said Thompson.\n\nDrive out of her gate and turn left, and you are in the Republic of Ireland; turn right and you are in Northern Ireland, but within minutes back in the Irish Republic again as you approach Clones.\n\nHer farm is in Northern Ireland. She gets her electricity from the Irish Republic. Her children go to school in Northern Ireland. Her neighbour\u2019s farm is in the Republic of Ireland. The old bog road to the left connecting the two main roads to Clones was once closed.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t do that now, because they have built houses on it,\u201d Thompson said. A dividend of peace that will be a nightmare for authorities after Brexit \u2013 deal or no deal.\n\nI cross the border six or seven times a day; so do most of my customers. What are we going to do after Brexit? Brian Johnston\n\nIn a garage down the road, nestled off a three-mile stretch that is Northern Ireland, the 68-year-old owner is confident there will be a hard border. \u201cThere are already mobile customs units going up and down here doing random checks for booze and cigarettes. Any intensification of that will effectively mean holdups and delays. That is a hard border. It\u2019s not watchtowers or soldiers,\u201d the owner said.\n\nThe road, despite being a rural single carriageway, is the main artery from Cavan to Monaghan, shuddering with HGVs and dairy collection tankers whose drivers barely register as they pass from the N54 (Irish road name) to the A3 (Northern Irish road name) and back again to the N54.\n\nJohnston said: \u201cI cross the border six or seven times a day; so do most of my customers. What are we going to do after Brexit?\u201d\n\nHe owns an agriculture and equine supplies business and has already taken steps to mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit, opening a second shop across the border in Butlers Bridge to ensure he keeps supplies and custom flowing in the event of mandatory checks on agrifeed.\n\nFor dairy farmers like Thompson on the border, Brexit poses an existential threat, and faith in politicians is in short supply.\n\n\u201cBrexit is just less than 40 days away and we are still in the dark. No one has spoken to us,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t get our milk collected every day or if there is a tariff, we would go out of business.\u201d\n\nThe flourishing local dairy business has consolidated to such an extent that much of the creamery production is south of the border, leaving farmers metres or miles to the north on a Brexit cliff edge.\n\nThey are paid 24 cents (21p) a litre, but EU tariffs on imports to the Irish Republic would add 21 cents a litre to the cost, leaving the farmer with no business.\n\nThere is also a fear that communities once split in two by border checks, road closures and sectarianism are at risk of a repeat division because of Brexit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ciaran Mulhall at the Peace Link\u2019s playing fields. The centre has built cross-community links through sport. Photograph: Lisa O'Carroll/The Guardian\n\nCiaran Mulhall, an administrator at The Peace Link, a sports centre, said: \u201cThere are eight roads into the town, but only two or three were open in the Troubles. It meant people from nearby couldn\u2019t be bothered coming into Clones.\u201d\n\nIt was built with \u00a36m of EU money and has been vital in building post-conflict relations through sport.\n\nRosslea, the hometown of the Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster \u2013 four miles away \u2013 felt light years away during the Troubles.\n\n\u201cThat four-mile journey turned into a 16-mile journey into Clones because of detours caused by road closures,\u201d said Mulhall. People from Rosslea gravitated towards Enniskillen, 24 miles away, because there was less hassle. Clones suffered badly, with businesses disappearing through lack of custom.\n\n\u201cThere were no new businesses opening in the town. Protestants wouldn\u2019t come here to shop or to have a drink,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cThe disconnect was always there. Even though people lived just two miles away, the habits were formed and were ingrained and when peace came, it was still difficult to persuade people to come into town.\u201d\n\nFive years since opening, The Peace Link is now proving a cross-community draw and building social cohesion.\n\n\u201cWe have people from all over the place, people in their 40s who grew up in the Troubles coming in and meeting people they would not have met before even though they just lived out the road,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cYou hear them saying: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a nice guy, they are all normal.\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, suspicions will be there for a long time between Protestants and Catholics, but in this place [the sports centre], religion doesn\u2019t matter like it did.\u201d\n\nBusiness in Clones has also picked up, with a couple of new shops. \u201cWe\u2019re still about a fifth of where we were before the Troubles. We\u2019re only looking for our fair share, to get back what we lost during the Troubles, and Brexit puts that at risk,\u201d said Mulhall.\n\n\u201cIf there are any checks on the road, these people will turn back to their old ways and reverse what has happened.\u201d", "description": "With Brexit putting jobs, homes and peace at risk, people on the complex frontier feel abandoned", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Kim Leadbeater", "Catherine Anderson", "Sean Farrell", "Antoinette Sandbach"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab22e0b50f4d6b5cf806008b72ea9dcfd52c397e/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=975f493ac96132d328c10deecefaea5c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
