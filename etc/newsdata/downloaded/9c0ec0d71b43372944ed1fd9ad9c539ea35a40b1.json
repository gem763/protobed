Ramon Azeez and \u00c1lvaro Vadillo netted in either half to leave Bar\u00e7a, who started with Lionel Messi on the bench, without a win in all four away matches this season.\n\nA win against a side they have beaten 11 times in their last 12 league meetings would have taken Bar\u00e7a top of the table on goal difference. But despite the introduction of Messi at half-time, it was Granada who took their opportunity to leapfrog Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and hit the summit.\n\nEuropean roundup: Lukaku seals Milan derby win as Ramsey scores for Juve Read more\n\nThe hosts went ahead in the second minute through Azeez. Roberto Soldado robbed Junior Firpo, fed Antonio Puertas and his cross was headed in by the striker from close range, leaving Bar\u00e7a trailing for the fourth time in five league matches.\n\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen made a fine save to push Puertas\u2019s shot wide as Granada attempted to double their advantage. Yangel Herrera, on loan from Manchester City, fired over before Bar\u00e7a had their first attempt on goal on the stroke of half-time, with Luis Su\u00e1rez having a shot blocked.\n\nErnesto Valverde shook things up at half-time, bringing on Messi and Ansu Fati for Junior and Carles P\u00e9rez. But Granada refused to be overawed and almost went 2-0 up following a howler from Ter Stegen.\n\nThe goalkeeper, under no pressure at all, dropped a catch before recovering to smother the ball before it could cross the goalline. Granada did double their advantage in the 66th minute, though, Vadillo scoring from the penalty spot after a handball from Arturo Vidal, who had just come on as a substitute.\n\nMessi tried in vain to haul Barcelona back into the game, sending in numerous crosses that came to nothing and having a shot saved by Rui Silva. The defeat \u2013 their second in five league games \u2013 sends Barcelona down to seventh in the table, three points behind Granada at the top.\n\nSu\u00e1rez said later that Barcelona have a \u201ctough year ahead of us\u201d. The striker said on AS: \u201cIt\u2019s a worrying defeat, a defeat that hurts. And a defeat that we have to take a real good look at, because there are lots of things that we have to improve.\n\nEden Hazard can shine at Real Madrid without being the new Cristiano Ronaldo | Barney Ronay Read more\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go yet, but these are the types of games that win you the title. We have to be tougher if we\u2019re going to win the league. We have a tough year ahead of us.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go behind so early,\u201d he said. \u201cThat made everything that bit tougher for us. We had possession of the ball, but we couldn\u2019t make it count. We have to analyse what happened.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to look at is the way we\u2019re playing as the away side, because the lack of cutting edge and chances is worrying. We\u2019re Barcelona, and we have to go out there to win the game \u2013 we can\u2019t start the way we did.\u201d\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid also slipped up as they were held to a goalless draw by Celta Vigo at the Wanda Metropolitano. Goalkeeper Rub\u00e9n Blanco was in inspired form for the visitors, producing several fine saves as Diego Simeone\u2019s men were frustrated.\n\nVillarreal left it late to beat Real Valladolid 2-0 and move up to fourth. The home side finally made the breakthrough in the 77th minute through Santi Cazorla. The former Arsenal midfielder scored from the penalty spot after Javier Ontiveros was brought down, and, Ontiveros netted a second a minute from time.", "description": "Goals from Ramon Azeez and \u00c1lvaro Vadillo in either half took Granada to a shock 2-0 home victory over Barcelona as the Andaluc\u00edan side went top of La Liga", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591609f2cf6d5ee0ba2fae47eb3ef4b282d28a4d/679_431_4273_2564/master/4273.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fb3626be81a7c234e95071d204c681ae", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
