Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Zac Gallen had just moved into his Miami apartment.\n\nTwo weeks later, he needed to move out.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA day after making his seventh career start with the Marlins and lowering his ERA to 2.72 with seven innings of two-run, eight-strikeout ball, the rookie right-hander was summoned to manager Don Mattingly\u2019s office.\n\nGallen, who was just beginning to get acclimated to his new surroundings, initially assumed the coaching staff wanted to go over his last outing. But the Marlins had other plans on July 31 \u2014 and they weren\u2019t sending Gallen back down to the minors.\n\nInstead, Miami sent the 24-year-old to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a trade-deadline deal. In exchange, the Marlins received middle infield prospect Jazz Chisholm. Mattingly and Michael Hill, Miami\u2019s president of baseball operations, delivered the news.\n\nWell, sort of.\n\n\u201cAt first, they didn\u2019t tell me what team I\u2019d been traded to. So at the end of the meeting, I was like, \u2018Hey, where am I going?\u2019\u201d Gallen, who will match up against Reds righty Trevor Bauer on Sunday, told Yahoo Sports.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say. But at the time, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just like I\u2019ve got to pack up my stuff within like 12 hours. It was crazy.\u201d\n\nDifferent city, same results\n\nGallen found out about the trade at 2:30 p.m. He left Marlins Park two hours later after cleaning out his locker, saying his goodbyes and talking to reporters. Next, it was time to pack. Fortunately, Gallen had a close friend in town, who proved to be a huge help with the move.\n\n\u201cMy phone was blowing up all day,\u201d Gallen said. \u201cAnd it was tough because I had to decide what to bring with me and what I was going to get shipped in my car a couple weeks later. I\u2019m kind of a paranoid packer.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, after taking a flight out west, Gallen found himself in another meeting with Diamondbacks GM Mike Hazen and manager Torey Lovullo. And this one went a bit differently.\n\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019re excited to have you. We wanted you for a few months now, and we were finally able to make it happen,\u2019\u201d Gallen was told.\n\n\u201cSo that was awesome to hear,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get traded, it\u2019s good and bad. One team doesn\u2019t want you, I guess you could say, but another does, so it\u2019s cool. I was really glad to hear that they had so much interest in me.\u201d\n\nWhile the Diamondbacks have sputtered of late, their playoff hopes hanging by a thread after a four-game sweep at the hands of the New York Mets at Citi Field, Gallen hasn\u2019t slowed down. And Arizona has yet to feel the sting of losing staff ace Zack Greinke, who they moved to Houston at the deadline.\n\nIn seven starts with the Diamondbacks, Gallen has compiled a 2.61 ERA. On Sept. 4, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning. In his last outing, against the Mets, he struck out nine \u2014 including All-Stars Jeff McNeil and Pete Alonso a combined five times in six plate appearances.\n\nZac Gallen, Filthy 87mph Changeup (release/spin axis/slow). \ud83d\ude37 pic.twitter.com/C6HdG4NOQz \u2014 Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 11, 2019\n\nHe is the second NL pitcher to begin his career with 14 consecutive starts allowing three or fewer runs. Over that span, he has averaged 11 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really good,\u201d Arizona veteran Robbie Ray said. \u201cHe knows how to pitch.\u201d\n\nOr, as one Diamondbacks source put it, \u201cSure, we had to give up Jazz. But he\u2019s been a damn good pickup for us.\u201d\n\nGallen didn\u2019t necessarily expect to be traded, though he had been before \u2014 a young player on a rebuilding team \u2014 but he\u2019s enjoyed his new environment so far.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the year, I didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d be anywhere close to a playoff hunt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then here I am two months after I made my debut and we\u2019re right in the mix. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nOh, what could\u2019ve been in Miami\n\nIn an alternate universe, Miami would still have a Big Three. It just wouldn\u2019t consist of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nA new trio of Luis Castillo, Chris Paddack and Domingo German would dominate on the mound. And with a potent lineup featuring Christian Yelich (Brewers), Giancarlo Stanton (Yankees), Marcell Ozuna (Cardinals) and J.T. Realmuto (Phillies), the Marlins would be among the favorites to reach the World Series in 2019.\n\nBut none of that is going to happen.\n\nCastillo has emerged as an NL Cy Young award candidate \u2014 in Cincinnati. Paddack just wrapped up a solid rookie year with six shutout innings against the Cubs \u2014 in San Diego. And German became an unsung hero, winning 18 games \u2014 in the Bronx.\n\nAll three starters were dealt away by the previous regime.\n\nCastillo netted Dan Straily. Paddack netted Fernando Rodney. And German (and Nathan Eovaldi) netted Martin Prado and David Phelps.\n\nWHAT IF of the day:\n\n\n\nWhat if the #Marlins didn\u2019t make bad trades & still had:\n\n\n\n1. Chris Paddack (for Rodney)\n\n2. Luis Castillo (for Straily)\n\n3. Domingo German (for Prado)\n\n4. Anthony Desclafani (for Latos)\n\nand had kept some combo of Yelich, Ozuna, Stanton, Gordon & Realmuto WHAT IF \u2014 Jim Bowden (@JimBowdenGM) May 10, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Marlins CEO Derek Jeter has gutted the team since taking over in 2017 \u2014 jettisoning all of the impact hitters listed above \u2014 and a massive rebuild is underway. Miami has the third-worst record in the majors, while drawing less than 10,000 fans per game.\n\nThe returns for Yelich, Stanton, Ozuna and Realmuto have been a mixed bag.\n\nLewis Brinson and Isan Diaz (Yelich deal) haven\u2019t been able to get over the Mendoza line. Sixto Sanchez (Realmuto deal) has a high ceiling as a starter. Righty Sandy Alcantara (Ozuna deal) was Miami\u2019s lone All-Star. And unloading Stanton\u2019s massive contract looks like it\u2019s already been a victory for the Marlins, even if the prospects they acquired from the Yankees (Jose Devers and Jorge Guzman) don\u2019t pan out.\n\nGallen was part of the Ozuna deal as well. Prior to his promotion, he went 9-1 with a 1.77 ERA at Triple-A New Orleans, and was just named Triple-A Pitcher of the Year by Baseball America as a result.\n\nBut Miami elected to take a shot on Chisholm, a raw, toolsy 21-year-old with high upside. He hit a combined .221/.321/.441 with 21 homers in 112 games at Double-A in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe were dealing, in our minds, from an organizational strength,\u201d Jeter told reporters in August. \u201cWe felt as though pitching is one of the strengths we had in the organization at the time and we want to continue to acquire top-notch position players, which we were able to do.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell whether it turns about to be another mistake by the once beloved Yankee captain and the rest of his front office.\n\nZac Gallen\u2019s rise to the majors\n\nWhen the Philadelphia Phillies won the championship in 2008, the South Jersey native Gallen wanted to attend the parade with his friends. But his mother, Stacey, wouldn\u2019t let him.\n\nYou see, Gallen didn\u2019t root for the Phillies growing up. The Cardinals were his favorite team, and Mark McGwire his favorite player.\n\n\u201cThe Phillies weren\u2019t really competitive when I was younger,\u201d Gallen said. \u201cSo it was fun for me to rag on my friends that were Phillies fans.\u201d\n\nAnd now, \u201cMy mom was like, \u2018No, you\u2019re not going, you weren\u2019t a fan. If you\u2019re not a Phillies fan, you can\u2019t go. You\u2019re not missing school.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Man, that stinks.\u2019 It was Halloween, so it wasn\u2019t a \u2018real\u2019 day of school, but I never hopped on that bandwagon.\u201d\n\nAs fate would have it, after starring at Bishop Eustace Prep School and then North Carolina, Gallen was selected by St. Louis in the third round of the 2016 MLB Amateur Draft. He ultimately made his major-league debut three years later with Miami, tossing five innings of one-run ball \u2014 against the Cardinals on June 20 at Busch Stadium.\n\nJun 20, 2019; St. Louis, MO, USA; Miami Marlins starting pitcher Zac Gallen (52) pitches during the first inning against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGallen looked up to sinker-slider pitchers Tim Hudson and Mike Leake (now his teammate) before his repertoire changed as he got older. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal,\u201d Gallen said of being in the same rotation as Leake, a pitcher he also admired for never having been in the minors.\n\nHe throws a fastball that averages 93.1 mph, plus a slider/cutter, a changeup and a curveball (which he didn\u2019t have until his sophomore year in college). Opponents are batting just .163 against his changeup, according to Brooks Baseball.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just been an ever-developing timeline of working on pitches that do certain things, and I\u2019ve been able to give guys different looks which has been able to help me out a ton,\u201d Gallen said.\n\nThree scouts told Yahoo Sports that Gallen projects as a No. 3-4 starter in the majors.\n\n\u201cHe fights command a little bit, but he\u2019s an aggressive guy,\u201d one scout said. \u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nGallen has started his career pitching above that projection, though. And he\u2019s got a chance to prove that Derek Jeter and the Marlins were wrong to trade him.\n\nMaybe he can even keep his next apartment for a while.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Diamondbacks righty Zac Gallen is just the second NL pitcher to begin his career with 14 consecutive starts allowing three or fewer runs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/56TySJb_kbnW1JGu.DCgMQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjQuOA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ki7leh.14FUxaEtaZ.idZQ--~B/aD0xNzk0O3c9MjQ4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/91e1aba0-d67e-11e9-8d37-e6edf05f6d20", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
