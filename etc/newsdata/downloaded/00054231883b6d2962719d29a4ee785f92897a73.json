USA TODAY\n\nYou may feel like you'll be paying off student loans until the day you die. But even that may not be the end of it.\n\nIt all depends on the type of loans you have and the lender, says Adam Minsky, a student loan attorney with offices in Boston and New York.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to determine if the loan is federal or not,\u201d Minsky says. \u201cIf it\u2019s private, then it\u2019s more nuanced; it comes down to what the contract says and when the loan was issued.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what happens to your student debt if you die and what you can do to ensure you won\u2019t burden the people left behind.\n\nPersonal finance: This is how much the average American saves each year\n\nWhat happens to your federal loan debt\n\nIf you die, your federal student loans will be discharged, meaning no further payments will be required. Your parent, spouse or another person you appoint will need to submit proof of death to your loan servicer. This means an original or copy of the death certificate.\n\nWhat happens to your private loan debt\n\nCLOSE Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are already vowing to do something about student loan debt. This is why the $1.6 trillion issue could play a big part in the 2020 election. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nIf you die with private loan debt, its future will depend on the lender\u2019s policy.\n\nPrivate loans you took out on your own are likely to be forgiven. (Ask your lender about its death discharge policy.) But a private loan that is co-signed by a parent or someone else might not.\n\nCo-signers are just as responsible for the loan as the student is. If the student dies, the co-signer is obligated to repay the loan unless the lender has a policy stating otherwise.\n\nThis applies to most existing loans, but not to new loans. All loans taken out after Nov. 20, 2018, must release a co-signer in the event of the student borrower\u2019s death, due to a provision in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act.\n\nIf you have a loan that was issued before Nov. 20, 2018, and your lender doesn\u2019t have an official discharge policy, there is still recourse. The lender will have a process in place called \u201ccompassionate review\u201d that could still result in your loans being forgiven or co-signer released, says April Query, regional and community services manager for College Foundation of North Carolina. Contact your lender to find out what the process entails.\n\nSick of seeing Christmas decorations before Halloween? Blame 40% of America\n\nWhat happens to your parents' loans?\n\nFederal direct PLUS loans will be discharged if a parent borrower or student for which the PLUS loan was taken out dies. Proof of death must be submitted to the servicer in the form of an original or copy of the death certificate.\n\nIf you have a private parent loan, contact your lender to find out its policy.\n\nNo tax implications for now\n\nUnlike some other debt forgiveness programs, death or disability discharge will not trigger a tax bill. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included a provision that made student debt that is discharged due to death exempt from taxes. This rule is in effect until 2025 and applies to all federal and private student loans.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo avoid any headaches for your estate, there are steps to take now to protect your loved ones.\n\nTalk to your parent (or someone else). If you have federal loans, tell your parents who your servicer is and how to contact them so they\u2019ll know where to send a death certificate. The same goes for any private debt. It\u2019s an uncomfortable talk, but it\u2019s necessary.\n\n\u201cOtherwise the parent might not know who to reach out to,\u201d says Query.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to burden your parents with this responsibility \u2013 \u201cI could see a parent completely forgetting to go and do that,\u201d says Query \u2013 you can ask someone else. She suggests finding a backup family member or friend to submit a death certificate to your servicer. You can ask someone or appoint them officially in your will.\n\nConsider death discharge policy when comparing private loans. This might not make or break your decision, but look for a lender that will discharge all debt for both you and your co-signer.\n\nCheck your private lender\u2019s policy. If you have existing private debt, your options will depend on your lender\u2019s policy. If it has a discharge policy that doesn\u2019t include your co-signer, find out if co-signer release is available to get them off your loan for good.\n\nConsider refinancing. You can refinance with a private lender that has co-signer release or a policy of discharging debt for the co-signer in case of death if your current lender doesn\u2019t offer this relief.\n\nTake out a larger life insurance policy, as a last resort. If you don\u2019t want to refinance or release your co-signer, Minsky suggests taking out a life insurance policy with a payout that your estate can use to cover your remaining debt.\n\nMORE: Income-driven repayment: Is it right for you?\n\nMORE: Deferment vs. forbearance: Which is right for your student loans?\n\nMORE: This is what happens to your debts after you die\n\nAnna Helhoski is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.
