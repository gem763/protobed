The build, the bog-brush haircut. Even his Teutonic \u2018I\u2019ll be Bach\u2019 monotone makes him sound like The Terminator.\n\nWe learned Fankhauser (above) received an extra \u00a3750,000 in 2017. Committee chairman Rachel Reeves (Lab, Leeds West) asked how much of that he intended to hand back to help with redundancy payments. \u2018Honestly, chair, I wasn\u2019t thinking of that,\u2019 he sighed\n\nHerr Fankhauser was up before the business committee yesterday. It was painful viewing at times.\n\nAs performances go, he made wooden old Arnie look like that great thespian Ralph Richardson.\n\nAlongside him was chairman Frank Meysman, with a neck-tie arranged in one of those fat Windsor knots last fashionable in the 1970s.\n\nAlso in attendance: fellow directors Sten Daugaard, Martine Verluyten and Warren Tucker. For two and a half hours they were grilled. None of this gal\u00e8re emerged with any credit.\n\nFormer Thomas Cook employees are pictured above in Westminster for the inquiry.

It was painful viewing at times\n\n\u2018Tank you for dis opportunity to say how deeply sorry vee are,\u2019 Fankhauser remarked upon opening, suitably humbled and hair-shirted.\n\nHis words might have rung a little less hollow had he not rolled in sporting what looked suspiciously like an autumn suntan.\n\nBehind him sat a number of ashen-faced Thomas Cook customers who\u2019ve been left out of pocket, as well as several of the firm\u2019s employees. Delightfully, they\u2019d turned up in their company uniforms.\n\nSwiss-born Peter Fankhauser is a ringer for the Austrian beefcake. The build, the bog-brush haircut.

I bet he wasn\u2019t!\n\nTuba-voiced Reeves had clearly eaten her oats that morning.\n\nWhile unlikely to be troubling the after-dinner speaking circuit, she\u2019s a smart cookie. She gave Brussels-born Meysman a proper going-over.\n\nSo often it\u2019s the businesses\u2019 chairmen, those cheery, hands-off creatures, whose main duty is invariably turning up to present the trophy at company golf day, who end up looking clueless in these situations.\n\nSure enough, the Belgian was no different. \u2018What is the position of Thomas Cook now? Reeves asked him. \u2018It no longer exists,\u2019 Meysman replied.\n\n\u2018And why is that?\u2019 she probed. \u2018That\u2019s a good question,\u2019 he pondered.\n\nAt that moment, I\u2019m fairly sure I could hear the meaty thwack of his media adviser\u2019s palm against his own forehead.\n\nTop of the committee\u2019s agenda was the remuneration that Fankhauser and his directors received during his five years in charge, in particular the \u00a320million they snaffled in bonuses [File photo]\n\nReeves\u2019 summing-up was a rip-snorter. The sort of rollicking designed to shame.\n\nThe failure of Thomas Cook, she declared, was down to their misjudgments while earning salaries higher than their employees could expect to earn in a lifetime.\n\nShe asked them to reflect on the dignity the employees had shown so lacking in themselves.\n\nAs words gently echoed around the committee room, the executives sat gormlessly for several moments, their glares frozen like five gargoyles staring back from the guttering.", "description": "HENRY DEEDES: Swiss-born Peter Fankhauser is a ringer for the Austrian beefcake.
