The Company continues to work closely with the federal and state governments toward a sustainable, long-term solution, and lifting of the blockade paves the way for the government-sponsored dialogue to resume. Operations at the mine remain temporarily suspended pending further evaluation of the situation on the ground and assurances that the blockade will not be allowed to resume.\n\nIn order to protect people, assets, and the long-term viability of the mine, operations at Pe\u00f1asquito had been safely suspended since the illegal blockade began on September 14.\n\nThe illegal blockade impacted Pe\u00f1asquito\u2019s third quarter production by approximately 11,000 gold ounces, 1.7 million silver ounces, 13.7 million pounds of lead and 22.8 million pounds of zinc, and is expected to impact the Company\u2019s full-year results for the operation. Through September 30, this represents an approximate production shortfall of 11,000 gold ounces and 51,000 gold equivalent ounces from co-products.\n\nPe\u00f1asquito Q3 2019 results Consolidated\n\nproduction Consolidated\n\nsales Gold (koz) 58 36 Silver (koz) 7,416 4,583 Lead (\u2018000 lbs) 51,100 29,700 Zinc (\u2018000 lbs) 83,100 107,100\n\nPe\u00f1asquito has enhanced water availability for the mine\u2019s 25 neighboring communities through a number of projects, including water treatment plants, new wells, pipelines and water trucks, along with 90 other infrastructure and community development projects. This includes installing and operating a Reverse Osmosis Plant in the Cedros community with a capacity of 600,000 liters of drinking water per day.\n\nPe\u00f1asquito directly employs more than 6,500 people while supporting another 20,000 indirect jobs in the region. Since 2005, the Company has invested approximately US$5 billion in Pe\u00f1asquito.\n\nAbout Newmont Goldcorp\n\nNewmont Goldcorp is the world\u2019s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.
