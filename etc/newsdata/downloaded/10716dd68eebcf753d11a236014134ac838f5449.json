As such, it\u2019s a worthy successor to the Commission\u2019s 2015 report on immigration detention facilities. For this most recent report, however, we didn\u2019t even visit a detention facility. That didn\u2019t stop the Commission majority from expressing its outrage at immigration detention, based solely on media reports and a public comment hearing in Washington, D.C. attended primarily by immigration advocates. As I note in my dissenting statement, the Commission received testimony from a grand total of three former detainees, two of whom complained of treatment they had received during the Obama Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commission report willfully misunderstands and mischaracterizes asylum claims, which, in essence, it assumes simply mean my home country isn\u2019t the best place to live or the U.S. is better than my home country. Actually, grounds for asylum are limited and specified by statute. \u201cMy home country isn\u2019t the best place to live\u201d isn\u2019t among them. The report also ignores the fact that most of those who initially pass a credible fear screening (which starts the asylum process) aren\u2019t ultimately granted asylum. And only 44.5 percent of those who pass an initial credible fear screening even bother showing up in court to press their asylum claim. The majority simply vanish into the interior of the country, never to be seen again.\n\nThe report also paints an unjust portrait of our approach to detained children, baldly claiming that children \u201cdie in detention.\u201d Even a cursory examination of the underlying facts reveal that Border Patrol agents sought medical care for children as soon as they showed signs of illness, and in one case where a child arrived at the border with a congenital heart defect, she was given medical care and surgery at not one, but two hospitals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commission\u2019s report is a pathetic effort to smear the president and the men and women who attempt to enforce our immigration laws.
