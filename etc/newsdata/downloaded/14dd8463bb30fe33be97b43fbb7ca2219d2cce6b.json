Shepard and Kristen Bell pose on vacation in Turks and Caicos in January 2018.\n\nWhen it comes to bedtime stories, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard aren\u2019t afraid to play favorites.\n\nThe couple revealed their top children\u2019s books while promoting Lightlife\u2019s plant-based burger. They have two daughters, 6-year-old Lincoln and 4-year-old Delta.\n\nOne story that both Shepard and Bell love reading to their kids is \u201cQuackenstein Hatches a Family\u201d by Sudipta Bardhan-Quallen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s by one of my favorite writers and has a bunch of fun pictures and large words!\u201d Bell told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a bird who adopts an egg at the zoo and thinks he\u2019s gonna have a chick, but it turns out to be a platypus,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cHe\u2019s scared of it for a while, and then he falls in love with it. And the platypus calls him \u2018Dad.\u2019 It\u2019s so cute. We\u2019ve probably read that more than any other book.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear Girl\u201d by Amy Krouse Rosenthal and Paris Rosenthal is also a family hit. Bell said she loves how the book \u201cpromotes empowerment and self-esteem about being who you are.\u201d\n\nShepard added that he also loves Shel Silverstein\u2019s classic \u201cThe Giving Tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why because it\u2019s so heartbreaking,\u201d the actor said. \u201cEvery time I read it I ask, \u2018Why do we read this book? It\u2019s so brutal.\u2019 And yet, it\u2019s a childhood favorite of mine, and I\u2019m now passing on this masochistic book to my kids.\u201d\n\nLately, however, bedtime stories have been a bit more grueling in the Bell-Shepard household.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a lull of books because the 6-year-old now has to practice reading,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cSo now we\u2019ve moved on to books that she can read, and they\u2019re terrible. Basically, each girl gets one book a night before bed, so we read one that\u2019s really boring \u2015 and then we\u2019ll break out \u2018Quackenstein\u2019 or some other book we love.\u201d\n\nThe pair also opened up about sharing the parenting load and the philosophies that have informed their marriage. Shepard said his approach \u201cstems from a selfish place\u201d of wanting to have a say in parenting conversations.\n\n\u201cI try to tell new dads, \u2019You\u2019re only entitled to an opinion at the same percentage of work you put in. So if you\u2019re doing 10% of everything, don\u2019t expect to have a 50-50 weighted opinion in the debate \u2015 and there are daily debates on what you should do as a parent,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cYou have to earn that. You have to have the capital to have that vote. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit at the table when we\u2019re making these decisions if I was participating at a fraction of what she was.\u201d\n\nBell agreed, noting that, \u201cIf worse comes to worst, you can always remind your partner, \u2018That kid is 50% yours. So I\u2019ll do 50% of it, but that other 50% is yours.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile she is admittedly a tad biased, Bell said she has also found two episodes of her husband\u2019s podcast, \u201cArmchair Expert,\u201d to be helpful. One features Belgian author and psychotherapist Esther Perel, who shares her thoughts on how to make marriage work. The other episode includes a conversation with American psychological researcher John Gottman about his findings on relationships. The main message: Communication is key.\n\n\u201cThere have been times when both my husband and I have needed to say to one another, \u2018I need you to pick up some slack around here.\u2019 And because there\u2019s an underlying trust in our partnership, we\u2019ve handled it really well,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to say, \u2018I need you to make more lunches,\u2019 and he can say \u2018OK, loud and clear.\u2019 It\u2019s often after some tense words, don\u2019t get me wrong. We get defensive toward each other, but those are just irrelevant triggers. The outcome is that we\u2019re listening to each other because we know we\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGood Place\u201d star added that she feels lucky she and Shepard are able to laugh together easily and even find it helpful to make fun of each other a little bit.", "description": "The couple have two daughters, Lincoln and Delta.", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da4befe20000069055008b3.jpeg?cache=CQx4OnzYWG&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
