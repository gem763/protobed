He is the author of Holding the Line: Inside Trump's Pentagon With Secretary Mattis, from which this article is adapted.\n\nLong before real planning for it began, and long before the first news stories about it, those of us in the top levels of the Pentagon heard President Donald Trump demand the military parade he would eventually get. The bizarre request was one of the first signs I had of the enormous rift between my boss at the time, Defense Secretary James Mattis, and the president.\n\nThe clash came in the middle of Trump\u2019s first Pentagon briefing on America\u2019s military and diplomatic \u201claydown\u201d\u2014a term of art used to describe all of the locations around the world with U.S. forces and embassies\u2014on July 20, 2017. Mattis, for whom I was working as chief speechwriter, had hoped the briefing would educate Trump on the United States\u2019 longstanding commitment to the rest of the world. That is not at all what happened.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nInstead, the president burst out in the middle of the meeting.\n\n\u201cI just returned from France,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you see President Macron\u2019s handshake?\u201d he asked no one in particular. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let go. He just kept holding on. I spent two hours at Bastille Day. Very impressive.\u201d\n\nA pause.\n\n\u201cI want a \u2018Victory Day.\u2019 Just like Veterans Day. The Fourth of July is too hot,\u201d he said, apparently out of nowhere. \u201cI want vehicles and tanks on Main Street. On Pennsylvania Avenue, from the Capitol to the White House. We need spirit! We should blow everybody away with this parade. The French had an amazing parade on Bastille Day with tanks and everything. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d\n\nThose of us in the control room linked to the Pentagon conference room shifted uncomfortably, shooting glances at each other. Where was this going? We\u2019d opened the control room door 30 minutes before to improve air flow. A Secret Service agent poked his head in, apparently uncomfortable with the conversation and the light it cast on the president. \u201cHey,\u201d he asked, \u201cdo you guys need to still be in here?\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt was far from what Mattis had expected as he prepared meticulously for the meeting just hours before.\n\nAs the seconds ticked down, Mattis\u2019 nervous energy had been palpable. Unusually so. Normally stoic and deliberate with his movements, this morning he was electrified. He was pacing in his office in the Pentagon, moving from a standing desk that faced the Potomac to the small circular table and back again. He shuffled his notes, putting them into a nondescript dark blue folder, pausing for a few seconds in hesitation before pulling them out again to rearrange their order. Things needed to be perfect.\n\nI understood why he was nervous. We all did. At any time, this briefing would be a big deal for the department, regardless of the president. But in Trump\u2019s case, the briefing had a heightened importance.\n\nJust a few weeks earlier, Trump had declared America\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. He was also threatening to dismantle the nuclear deal with Iran, withdraw from NATO, pull U.S. forces back from South Korea, Germany and Japan, give Russia a pass on its electoral interference in the 2016 election, and, in his spare time, start a war with North Korea.\n\nIn private, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Mattis feared these actions signaled America\u2019s diminished authority as a world leader and emboldened China, Russia and Iran to fill the vacuum. They felt incredible pressure to educate the president, believing that if only Trump could be made to recognize the value of American allies and the stability afforded by the presence of our troops, he\u2019d reconsider and alter course.\n\nIf anyone could change the president\u2019s mind, it was Mattis. He had maintained a close relationship with Trump since he was confirmed in early 2017, visiting the White House two or three times a week for meetings, lunch and sometimes dinner. It was obvious to us that Trump valued Mattis\u2019 opinion and simply liked having him around to bounce ideas off.\n\nI suspect Trump also liked that, as far as cabinet members go, Mattis was about as low-key as a senior official could get. He was careful not to seek the spotlight and minimized his interaction with the press, explaining, \u201cIf I say six and the president says a half dozen, I guarantee you the article the next day is going to be \u2018the secretary of defense and the president disagree on the fundamentals.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe plan for the briefing was for Mattis to speak first, walking Trump through details on every U.S. military deployment abroad, demonstrating America\u2019s return on investment. Tillerson would follow with slides on U.S. embassies and missions abroad. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn would speak last to highlight the importance of global trade flows. I would be in an adjoining control room, watching, listening and running the slide show.\n\nAs lead organizer for the briefing, I arrived hours early to ensure everything was ready before setting up shop in the control room. The president, however, was running a few minutes behind, which only added to the tension.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s motorcade finally pulled up, Mattis greeted the president at his armored limo, known as \u201cThe Beast,\u201d and they posed for a quick photo. Reporters shouted questions, to which the president simply replied, \u201cWe\u2019re doing very well against ISIS. ISIS is falling fast,\u201d before Mattis whisked him into the entryway and to the conference room.\n\nTrump stood at the head of the table facing three large television screens. He was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Tillerson, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and senior adviser Jared Kushner. Seated to his left were Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford and Cohn. Notably absent was National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster. Sitting with the \u201cback benchers,\u201d or senior officials who sit in chairs along the walls of the room, was Steve Bannon.\n\nTrump took his place at the head of the table with a frown fixed on his face. Offering few greetings to anyone, he sat with his arms crossed, refusing to look at Mattis. To me it seemed that his mind was already made up. He appeared to see this entire briefing as pointless\u2014but perhaps I was reading too much into all of this. At least I hoped so.\n\nAs planned, Mattis kicked off the meeting with remarks we had rehearsed in his office a number of times. Mattis tends to turn professorial during important meetings, providing the audience with excessive detail rather than tailoring his approach to the group he\u2019s speaking with. This instinct worsens when he is anxious about an event, and he will spend an inordinate amount of time on tactical details that have little bearing on strategic outcomes in order to bolster his confidence level. Unfortunately, to the room his opening sounded too much like a lecture.\n\nTrump scowled.\n\nMattis worked through his first slide about \u201cchokepoints,\u201d extremely narrow, landlocked corridors between larger bodies of water. He then shared his philosophical view about America\u2019s two fundamental powers of intimidation and inspiration, telling the president a story I\u2019d heard many times.\n\nYears before, a terrorist had attempted to kill then-two-star general Mattis with an improvised explosive device. Marines notified Mattis that they had captured the terrorist as he was trying to place the device on the road Mattis frequently traveled, using two 155-millimeter mortar rounds, a car battery and a detonator. Not the terrorist\u2019s finest day. As Mattis told me during a meeting in his office, \u201cThe terrorist realized as he stared down the rifle barrels pointed at him that he was in danger of losing his 401(k).\u201d\n\nMattis decided to speak with the terrorist after he was apprehended. Once in a holding room, Mattis slid a cup of coffee across the table to help break the ice as he sat down. Ultimately, the terrorist wanted to know: \u201cDo you think if I\u2019m really good at Guantanamo, will they let me move to America after I\u2019m released?\u201d As Mattis told it, the story represents two fundamental powers: We can intimidate others through our military superiority, but America\u2019s power to inspire is every bit as\u2014and perhaps even more\u2014powerful.\n\nMattis continued with his briefing, walking through in exacting detail the force ratios in each major geographic location. He sought to convince the president that our allies and partners put forward far more troops in support of stability abroad than America does. In short, America gets a good deal from an overseas military presence.\n\nThe president frowned, fiddling with the papers in front of him while glancing around the room.\n\nMattis\u2019 third slide triggered a stronger response from Trump. A visual depiction of our Pacific posture, this slide zoomed in on the U.S. forces located in Japan and South Korea\u2014forces that had kept the peace in both countries for more than six decades. It detailed the numbers of troops in each country, the cost to American taxpayers, and the costs borne by our allies to support forces in their country. Mattis made the point that America had been willing to accept unfair terms following World War II in order to get both countries back on their feet, but that now would be an opportune time to update our trade agreements should Trump desire to do so.\n\nMattis loved this slide because it outlined the significant contributions both nations were making, with Japan footing part of the bill to shift U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam, and South Korea paying to move Army soldiers to a new base. He emphasized to the president the importance of Japan paying to offset the costs for a new base, saying it was the first time in history they\u2019d done so.\n\n\u201cWho is paying the rest of the bill for the move to Guam?\u201d the president demanded. He was upset that Japan was only covering a part of the total costs required to relocate the base.\n\nThere was silence. But only briefly.\n\n\u201cOur trade agreements are criminal,\u201d Trump thundered\u2014despite the fact that Mattis was not talking about anything trade-related. \u201cJapan and South Korea are taking advantage of the United States.\u201d This was decidedly not the message Mattis\u2019 slide intended to convey.\n\nOut of nowhere, the president added, \u201cAnd the USS Ford [the navy\u2019s newest aircraft carrier] is completely out of control with cost overruns!\u201d\n\nMattis struggled to regain control of the meeting. In one sense he got what he\u2019d wanted. The president was definitely engaged, but not in the way Mattis had hoped.\n\nTwenty-five minutes later, it was Tillerson\u2019s turn to run the gauntlet. Tillerson was by nature a slow talker. I could tell at once that was not an endearing quality to Trump. When Tillerson\u2019s turn was over, Trump looked like a kid who had been told it was time for recess.\n\nCohn\u2019s brief was easily the best of the three. It consisted of only three slides. Sensing the president\u2019s mood, Cohn was in and out in under five minutes. All eyes shifted to the president.\n\n\u201cA very good study, thank you,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThis is one big monster created over a number of years. Japan \u2026 Germany \u2026 South Korea \u2026 our allies are costing more than anyone else at the table!\u201d Again, not the message any of us had intended.\n\nThen the president paused. His eyes seemed animated by a thought.\n\nHe followed with his observations about Macron\u2019s handshake and his outburst about Victory Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Secret Service agent asked if we all needed to be there, we stayed seated. Yes. Yes, we did. Just try to get us to leave.\n\nMattis and his team\u2019s response to the president\u2019s suggestion made clear that they were adamantly opposed to a military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Mattis and others voiced concern that a parade like what Trump wanted would harken back to Soviet Union\u2014like displays of authoritarian power. Mattis stated that precious taxpayer dollars would be better spent elsewhere, and that the optics of such a display of power would boomerang, causing more harm to America\u2019s international prestige than any domestic benefit could outweigh. Mattis was also concerned that a parade would risk eroding the military\u2019s long-standing apolitical reputation.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter\u2014Trump was serious. Mattis deflected and played for more time by saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at some options and get back to you, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nOn it went, with Tillerson and Mattis taking turns with the president, each jumping in to try to keep the discussion focused on the importance of America\u2019s alliance structure, of the critical nature of our global footprint and the economic benefit the United States derives from ensuring global stability and order.\n\nAlong the way Cohn interjected at times, as did Priebus, trying to find some areas of common agreement that would satisfy the president.\n\nPence and Kushner sat stone-faced, not uttering a single word throughout the entire meeting. Maybe they were the smart ones. Over time Mattis began to shut down, sitting back in his chair with a distant, defeated look on his face. He had cared so much about this meeting, had poured his heart and soul into it, and had believed firmly in his ability to bring Trump around to his way of thinking. None of his attempts were working. From my vantage point, Mattis was playing a game of chess against a president fixated on \u201cRock, Paper, Scissors.\u201d\n\nMattis did not think Trump was a raving lunatic, as some were trying to portray the president. In fact, Mattis had made a point of noting to us that America elected Trump for a reason. That the president had tremendous political skills, a sharp intuition and a formidable business career. Those qualities deserved respect. But still Trump could tax Mattis\u2019 patience, and the president\u2019s view of the world was both simplistic and troublesome. That was clear today.\n\nAcross the table from Mattis, Tillerson also became increasingly frustrated, jousting verbally with the president before becoming so exasperated that he stopped talking completely for the last half-hour of the meeting. Tillerson sat back in his chair with his arms crossed, an incredulous scowl on his face as he shot pointed looks over to Mattis.\n\nMany times during Tillerson\u2019s tenure, reporters would claim that he thought his boss was an idiot\u2014and each time Tillerson would deny it publicly. But there was no doubt among most observers in the room that day that Tillerson was thinking exactly that. Both men\u2014Mattis and Tillerson\u2014were despondent. We had just witnessed a meeting with Trump, up close and personal.\n\nNow we knew why access was controlled so tightly.\n\nFor the remainder of the meeting, Trump veered from topic to topic\u2014Syria, Mexico, a recent Washington Post story he didn\u2019t like\u2014like a squirrel caught in traffic, dashing one way and then another.\n\nThe issues were complicated, yet all of the president\u2019s answers were simplistic and ad hoc. He was shooting from the hip on issues of global importance.\n\nWith that, the meeting ended.\n\nI learned an important lesson that would pay off when Trump returned for a briefing the following January: only use slides with pictures \u2026 no words.\n\nDespite the challenging environment that existed between the Pentagon and the White House, Mattis was able to score a succession of victories over the next eight months: releasing the nation\u2019s first national defense strategy after going more than 10 years without one; working with coalition and Kurdish forces to bring ISIS to the edge of defeat in Syria; and working with Congress to restore funding to begin rebuilding a badly depleted military.\n\nStill, despite these wins, Trump and power struggles within the administration soon took their toll on Mattis. Those of us on his front office team watched as ally after ally in the administration\u2014Tillerson, McMaster and chief of staff John Kelly\u2014took incoming fire from the White House and the media. By the end of April 2018, Tillerson and McMaster would be gone.\n\n\n\n***\n\nOn May 11, 2018, I watched as the tide within the administration shifted away from Mattis. That day, Mattis hosted a group of newly appointed senior counterparts in the Pentagon, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton, along with other principals and military officials.\n\nAfter presentations from Mattis, Bolton, Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Steve Mnuchin and chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, Mattis opened the floor for discussion. Things quickly got interesting as senior leaders jockeyed for influence.\n\nBolton jumped right in after Mattis opened the floor, saying that the \u201cproblem is that all of the departments have different priorities.\u201d \u201cTo serve the president,\u201d he said, \u201cdepartmental efforts should be integrated.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wrong, but the way he said it gave me pause. His comment seemed to indicate that as national security advisor he should be the integrator and therefore the de facto lead. After a year within the administration, I thought he was probably right. Someone needed to be in charge of coordinating the administration\u2019s efforts.\n\nBolton looked over at Mnuchin. \u201cSteve, there are differences, and that\u2019s OK. We have to give the president crisper alternatives.\u201d Around the table it went. Bolton was making some compelling points, not the least of which was that \u201cthe administration was losing time\u201d by merely bouncing from distraction to distraction. Mnuchin tried to wield the most influence by making sweeping, declarative statements as if he was speaking for the White House. Kudlow was also attempting to assert himself by saying that he and Bolton needed to do a better job with the interagency process, implying that as chief economic adviser he was a key player in how things ran in the administration. For the next five minutes, Mnuchin and Kudlow went back and forth, cutting each other off to get their word in.\n\nIt was as if the treasury secretary and chief economic adviser had started their own trade war in the Pentagon.\n\nMattis finally had enough. He cut Kudlow off mid-sentence. \u201cI think we\u2019re all there, Larry \u2026 \u201d Rejoining the conversation, Mattis employed tired soundbites rather than actually engaging in an in-depth discussion. He seemed weary.\n\nThe meeting petered out about an hour and 45 minutes after it started. Sensing things were rapidly coming to a close, Mattis thanked everyone for coming. Gathering his things, he turned and walked out of the room and down the hall, fully expecting the others to flow out of the room behind him.\n\nThey didn\u2019t.\n\nInstead, the other principals and uniformed members remained behind and clustered in small groups to continue their conversations. That by itself isn\u2019t too noteworthy\u2014leaders usually congregated afterward to follow up on issues raised during a meeting\u2014but what happened next is.\n\nMattis came back.\n\nI\u2019d never seen anything like this. Mattis makes a decision and sticks with it, come hell or high water. But this time he didn\u2019t. He must have made it down the hall before realizing that no one else had followed him out, then turned around to come back to the room.\n\nI watched as two minutes after Mattis left the room, he returned, awkwardly standing in the doorway and watching the scene before him. He didn\u2019t say a word to anyone. He just stood there by himself. A few people glanced up and saw him standing there, but they didn\u2019t invite him into their conversation.\n\nAfter another minute, Mattis slowly turned and walked back out again.\n\nAlone.\n\nFrom HOLDING THE LINE: Inside Trump\u2019s Pentagon With Secretary Mattis by Guy M.
