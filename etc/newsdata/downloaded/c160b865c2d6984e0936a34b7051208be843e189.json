(AP) - Rookie PJ Washington erupted for 27 points on seven 3-pointers, and the Charlotte Hornets opened the post-Kemba Walker era with a thrilling come-from-behind 126-125 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Hornets made 23 3-pointers, the most in franchise history in a regulation game. Their record is 24, but that came in a double-overtime game.\n\nDevonte Graham was a difference-maker off the bench with 23 points on 6-of-7 3-point shooting to go along with eight assists, while Marvin Williams had 17 points on five 3s.\n\nTogether, Washington, Graham and Williams were 18 of 25 from 3-point range, offsetting the Bulls\u2019 78 points in the paint.\n\nLauri Markkanen led the Bulls with 35 points and 17 rebounds. Chicago also got a strong game from their top draft pick Coby White, who had 17 points and seven assists in his NBA debut in his home state.\n\nWashington, who wasn\u2019t announced as a starter until 90 minutes before tipoff, hit 5 of 8 from beyond the arc in the first half and set a Hornets franchise record for most points by a rookie in a season opener.\n\nCody Zeller added 15 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte.\n\nTerry Rozier, Walker\u2019s replacement, struggled in his Charlotte debut with seven points on 2-of-10 shooting and wasn\u2019t even in the game in the final minute, instead replaced by the red-hot Graham.\n\nThe Hornets overcame a 10-point deficit with less than 6 minutes to play as Graham hit a pair of 3-pointers to ignite a rally. Graham also had two key free throws to put the Hornets up 3 late in the game.\n\nInstead of going for a 3 to tie the game, Zach Lavine drove for a layup with 4 seconds left. The Hornets ran out the clock from there with the Bulls unable to foul.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBulls: Outrebounded the Hornets 49-41. \u2026 Allowed the Hornets to shoot 52.3% from 3-point range.\n\nHornets: Coach James Borrego went with Rozier, Dwayne Bacon, Miles Bridges, Zeller and Washington as his starting five, a combination that has just 13 years of combined NBA experience. \u2026 The previous record for points by a Hornets rookie in a season opener was Emeka Okafor with 19. \u2026 Nic Batum left the game in the second half with a sprained hand.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBulls: Visit the Grizzlies on Friday night.\n\nHornets: Host the Timberwolves on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rookie PJ Washington erupted for 27 points on seven 3-pointers, and the Charlotte Hornets opened the post-Kemba Walker era with a thrilling come-from-behind 126-125 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/bulls_hornets_basketball_81844_c0-194-4656-2910_s1200x700.jpg?35418f3c228a6aa2ac620223801ae15ae7468ef5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
