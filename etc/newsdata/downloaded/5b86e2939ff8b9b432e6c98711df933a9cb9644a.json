Okay, it\u2019s not exactly floating. The sturdy arms attached to the screen\u2019s sides play a central role in the effect, giving it a huge range of movement, more so than almost any other laptop made for gaming or not. It\u2019s like if the articulating screen from the Microsoft Surface Studio all-in-one desktop came to a laptop, along with a similarly high price.\n\nThe entry-level configuration that I\u2019m reviewing costs $3,799, and despite the similarities it has with Microsoft\u2019s artist-friendly desktop, Acer\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t support active styluses, like Surface products or many other laptops do. I don\u2019t think that most gamers will care about this omission, but it\u2019s nonsense that a laptop this expensive with a design that mirrors a drawing surface doesn\u2019t actually work as one.\n\nOur review of Acer Predator Triton 900 Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Moveable 4K screen\n\nPowerful hardware\n\nComfortable key switches Bad Stuff Screen doesn\u2019t support digitizer styluses\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely humongous\n\nCramped keyboard and trackpad setup\n\n4K screen is limited to 60Hz refresh rate Buy for $4,106.99 from CDW Buy for $3,799.99 from Newegg\n\nAs for what the screen can do, you can move back and forth without altering the viewing angle. And if you need to rotate it, the hinge allows for a 180-degree flip. Is this mostly a gimmick? Yes. How essential is a moveable screen during gaming? Not very, at least for me, though it comes in handy if you\u2019re dealing with errant glare. (It\u2019s going to happen with a display this glossy.) The main reason that I don\u2019t find myself adjusting the screen during gameplay is that it\u2019s so darn sharp that even the smallest details pop no matter how far away I have it situated.\n\nA lot of my enjoyment of the moveable display came when I wasn\u2019t gaming. Its 17.3-inch screen is a huge canvas where having a multiwindow arrangement running all day long feels pretty comfortable. I find that a clear picture angled parallel to my eyes helps me concentrate better, and the Triton 900 is always at the ready to accommodate in that regard, whether I\u2019m sitting or standing up at work. That\u2019s not something that a standard clamshell laptop can provide, at least without frequently adjusting my chair, desk, or physically moving myself around.\n\nAcer Predator Triton 900 specs 17.3-inch 4K IPS touchscreen display\n\nIntel Core i7-9750H six-core processor\n\n32GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM\n\n2x 512GB NVMe SSD storage\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card\n\nFullHD webcam\n\n72Wh battery\n\n9.04-pound weight\n\n16.85 (w) x 11.94 (d) x 0.93 (h) inches\n\nSurprisingly, the premium on its moveable screen isn\u2019t egregious. It\u2019ll cost you roughly the same (plus or minus a few hundred dollars, depending on the brand) as any other gaming laptop with a six-core 9th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia RTX 2080 graphics card, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 4K IPS LCD display. If you were already planning on spending the big bucks on a hulking gaming laptop that\u2019s not very portable (instead of saving thousands on a DIY desktop build with similar specs), this currently seems to be one of the more interesting choices.\n\nThe Triton 900 physically dominates my shared desk at home. It\u2019s almost 17-inches wide, plus an extra half an inch on each side for the screen\u2019s hinges. It weighs nine pounds, which makes carrying it around a literal pain. It\u2019s tough to find a bag that can accommodate a 17-inch laptop these days. Even if you do find one, it doesn\u2019t change that this laptop just isn\u2019t any fun to haul around, especially since it can\u2019t last for long without its 330W power adapter, piling on another two pounds.\n\nThe bottom chassis that the screen is tethered to is much like what you\u2019d find on other gaming laptops. Its machined aluminum is angularly styled at nearly every corner, which will certainly elicit some sort of reaction out of bystanders. It\u2019s wide enough to fit two top-firing speakers, an 82-key (80 percent) backlit low-profile mechanical keyboard, and a trackpad side to side, though not without a few compromises.\n\nIts speakers are powerful enough to make my glass table vibrate, but they don\u2019t sound great. They\u2019re fine in a pinch, like for video conference call, but they lack the punch that would make me want to use them instead of a set of headphones. The mechanical keys have a satisfying click to them, and they\u2019re more enjoyable to use than ones found on a MacBook, though the key travel distance is still shallow. The trackpad is located to the right of the keyboard (to the benefit of right-handed people only), and using it is actually a good experience, thanks to its Windows Precision trackpad drivers.\n\nI have a few quibbles, however. The keyboard is near the front of the chassis, leaving nowhere to rest your palms and wrists while you type. This is more of a constraint than a misguided design decision since Acer had to make room for powerful hardware and enough fans to keep it all cool. If you don\u2019t use a wrist rest already, you\u2019ll probably need to buy one. But if you plan to game on your lap, the keyboard will be even more uncomfortable to use.\n\nThe question mark key and right Shift key on the right side are squished together in such a way that errors are almost guaranteed while typing quickly. The trackpad is responsive to touch and multifinger gestures, though its tall orientation feels cramped. It\u2019s definitely not suited for fast-paced games. If you decide not to use the trackpad, it can be turned into a number pad by tapping its corner twice. These virtual numkeys aren\u2019t tactile and sometimes don\u2019t respond to quick taps, so it won\u2019t be a good replacement for an external number pad, though it can work in a pinch.\n\nThe tall orientation of the trackpad is awkward, so you\u2019ll want to use a separate mouse\n\nThe keyboard also includes macro keys, user-programmable shortcuts, above the function keys. A key labeled \u201cP\u201d (for Predator, presumably) switches between up to three macro groups, giving you nine configurable keys that you can assign a function to. You can assign a button to do things like launch an installed app, increase the fan speed, disable the Windows key, and more. All of this is really useful if you find yourself wanting to tweak lots of settings on the fly, something that gamers usually do.\n\nThis is all configurable in Acer\u2019s PredatorSense suite, a utility where you can also do things like tweak the backlight pattern of the keyboard and the light that shines on the glass-covered fan near it, overclock the machine\u2019s graphics card, and monitor its running temperature.\n\nThere are vents all around the Triton 900, a few for taking in air and some for blowing it out. A system this powerful gets hot, up to 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) while running Battlefield V at 4K resolution with ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS (deep learning supersampling) feature switched on. With the fans roaring loudly, I was a little frightened to put it on my lap, but it was surprisingly tolerable (though much too warm for the summer months). The laptop blows a majority of the hot air out of the back, a place with which my fingers and legs don\u2019t really come into contact. There\u2019s an air intake on the top of the chassis next to the Gorilla Glass-covered heatsink and fan that takes up the rear half of the computer. Acer\u2019s decision to push the keyboard so close to the front ensures that the CPU and GPU can stay cool, and it works at the expense of an ergonomic keyboard and mouse setup.\n\nThe unique keyboard position makes it possible to adequately cool the processor and graphics card\n\nYou can usually count on a healthy amount of ports on a gaming laptop, and the Triton 900 isn\u2019t a letdown. There are two USB 3.1 (Type-A) ports, headphone and microphone jacks, a Thunderbolt 3 port, and, somewhat bafflingly, a fold-out USB 2.0 port to the left of the keyboard. Acer calls it an \u201cXbox controller port,\u201d so the idea is that you\u2019ll plug in an Xbox wireless adapter, fold it shut, then forget about it. Though, I found that the port had enough clearance once folded in to fit a small flash drive or a USB receiver for my Logitech mouse. The last few remaining ports include Ethernet, HDMI, and DisplayPort.\n\nThis laptop is no slouch when it comes to performance. Outside of gaming, it showed no signs of slowing down under what I\u2019d consider to be a moderate load: 20 Google Chrome tabs open, along with Affinity Photo for editing photos, and a few other apps. You\u2019d hope for as much from a $3,799 laptop, right?\n\nBattery life is another story, though. This is a big weak point for gaming laptops, in general, but this one\u2019s lifespan under that same load came in at about an hour, which is disturbingly short. It has a 72Wh battery inside, which is less than smaller, thinner devices, like the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Turning on Apex Legends shortened the runtime to around 45 minutes. This computer burns through its battery quickly.\n\nAnother common issue for high-end gaming laptops built with 1440p or 4K displays is that they usually can\u2019t run every game smoothly at native resolution. For example, the Triton 900 runs Battlefield V and Apex Legends at sub-30 frames per second when set to 4K resolution, with all of the graphical settings switched to maximum. Overclocking (easily switched on via Acer\u2019s preinstalled software suite) improve things quite a bit, though I still wasn\u2019t getting a super smooth 60 frames per second in either game.\n\nThere were plenty of games that I tested, like Astroneer and Forza Horizon 4, that run beautifully at native 4K resolution. However, Cyberpunk 2077, and other graphically intensive games will arrive as we near the verge of a new console generation. This machine will be ready for them, but you can expect some of the latest games to be too punishing for its overclocking ability to keep up.\n\nGraphically intensive games will push the Triton 900 to its limits\n\nThe fact that the 4K screen supports G-Sync might be a selling point for some. For background, G-Sync is Nvidia\u2019s technology that precisely syncs up a screen\u2019s variable refresh rate to what the graphics card is outputting. G-Sync, compared to V-Sync used in a traditional display, minimizes screen tearing and other graphical hitches without increasing input lag. So, ideally, you get better performance out of your hardware without costing you precious milliseconds, which is the kind of precision that competitive gamers want. Unfortunately, this screen is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, so the fastest frame rates you\u2019ll see are capped at 60 frames per second. It looks great, though you can better see this tech in action on high refresh rate monitors that allow 144 frames per second (or more) to be displayed.\n\nTalking about a device\u2019s limitations is important, especially when it costs nearly $4,000. Gaming laptops strive to pack in the most performance hardware, so you\u2019ve got to hand it to manufacturers when they figure it out, especially when they also implement a fun, moveable screen. But the compromises here, which are mostly inherent in all gaming laptops, lay on thick.\n\nAcer\u2019s Predator Triton 900 is powerful enough for a gamer to enjoy, but its 60Hz refresh rate display is a disappointment. This amount of money should get you a screen with a faster refresh rate, and as a gamer, I\u2019d look elsewhere if that\u2019s important to you. And if you\u2019re an artist who\u2019s intrigued by the Surface Studio-inspired display, its lack of active stylus support is a huge oversight on Acer\u2019s part.\n\nThe Triton 900 is a weird compromise between a killer gaming setup and a designer\u2019s dream machine\n\nWhat good is a laptop that\u2019s so big that you can\u2019t reasonably tote it around without some serious effort? What good is a 4K display if the machine can\u2019t run many popular games at that resolution? It\u2019s not great.\n\nI applaud Acer for attempting to broaden the appeal of its gaming laptop by appealing to artists or really anyone who has loads of cash and wants a laptop with an interesting design. But, in doing so, the Predator Triton 900 is left halfway between meeting what die-hard gamers and artists want in a machine. It\u2019s capable of a lot, but the caveats, small as they seem, are deal-breakers.", "description": "Acer\u2019s new Predator Triton 900 is a new spin on a gaming laptop design with a massive 17-inch articulating display.
