Enjoying it with my boys,' followed by a blue heart emoji\n\nIt's been a tough few weeks for Coleen, whose dramatic revelation about Rebekah Vardy enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from the pregnant WAG, following claims that she had been selling stories about her.\n\nColeen admitted that stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection were only viewed by Rebekah and these were subsequently followed by media outlets, including MailOnline.\n\nRebekah cut her family holiday to Dubai short after Coleen's dramatic accusation, which has captured Britain in the so-called 'war of the WAGs.'\n\nSources close to Becky say leading law firm Kingsley Napley has sent Coleen a letter on her behalf demanding she provides them with the evidence she has against Becky so that she can complete her investigation.\n\nCancelled: The WAG, 33, told her Twitter followers she was home in the UK with her youngest son Cass, 20 months, recovering after falling 'poorly with an infection'\n\nMeanwhile, friends of Coleen say she will not be goaded into coming forward with any further evidence as she is happy with her own investigations.\n\nBecky has called in a forensic team to analyse her Instagram account. The aim is to identify the mole who sold fake stories to The Sun from Coleen\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nColeen wrote on October 9: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nOne on one: Coleen posted a snap of little Cass in a local park and told her fans the pair had enjoyed a 'lovely morning in the fresh air' on Sunday\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while).\n\nDrama: Coleen (pictured left in June 2016) has been embroiled in a so-called WAG war with Rebekah (pictured right in February 2019)\n\nThe statement: Coleen made these claims on Instagram on October 9 after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah's account\n\nWag-atha Christie: Coleen tweeted these words back in January, highlighting how she has been trying to get to the bottom of who was leaking stories on her life for some time\n\n'Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nRebekah hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations, she wrote: 'Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant. As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for. If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nShe continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'", "description": "The WAG,\u00a033, cut a casual figure as she was seen carrying a\u00a0Rumpus Resort carrier bag outside the luxury\u00a0lingerie, swimwear, resort wear and jewellery shop.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/15/20135954-0-image-a-73_1571928129123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
