Nearly as galling to Rothy\u2019s, Steve Madden\u2019s shoes retail for half the price. (Rothy\u2019s charges $145 for its shoes. Steve Madden sells its version for $70, and unlike Rothy\u2019s, which are never discounted, Steve Madden\u2019s version of the shoe is currently on sale at Nordstrom Rack for $39.99.)\n\nSteve Madden \u2014 now a 29-year-old company that\u2019s publicly traded, valued by investors at $3 billion, and largely still run by Steve Madden himself (he\u2019s its creative and design chief) \u2014 is known for finding inspiration in the work of other brands that wish it would not. Among a handful of companies to tangle legally with the shoe titan in recent years is venture-backed Allbirds, which accused Steve Madden of copying its wool trainer in 2017.\n\nAllBirds soon settled its lawsuit with the company. Alas, now AllBirds is reportedly fighting an Austrian footwear company, Giesswein Walkwaren, for making and selling sneakers that are \u201cidentical in all material respects\u201d to Allbirds\u2019s wool runners.\n\nMeanwhile, Rothy\u2019s just last month settled with a company, OESH, against which it had separately filed a patent and trade dress infringement lawsuit alleging its round-toe ballet flats are too similar to Rothy\u2019s own.\n\nNeither is an uncommon situation. Instead, both underscore that for young retail brands, fending off competitors both big and small can prove both expensive and distracting. Indeed, the question begged is whether it\u2019s worth engaging.\n\nWhile that\u2019s something that usually be determined only in hindsight, not everyone thinks it makes sense to spend the time and resources battling knock-offs. When we talked earlier this year with the venture-backed slipper-shoe startup Birdies, cofounder Bianca Gates noted that Target had already begun offering a similar slipper at a cheaper price point. \u201cEverybody copies everybody,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company could use some of its funding to wage war, but she thought focusing on the company\u2019s product made more sense. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to create a brand beyond the silhouette of a slipper, because that can be knocked off, it\u2019s not defensible. What is defensible is why [a customer] is buying Birdies, and why she is telling her friends to shop us.\u201d", "description": "In August, after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the venture-backed shoe startup Rothy\u2019s, shoe giant Steven Madden filed a pre-emptive lawsuit asking a federal court to rule that its Rosy Flat shoes don\u2019t copy design elements of the Point ballet flat that Rothy\u2019s began selling soon after its 2016 launch.
