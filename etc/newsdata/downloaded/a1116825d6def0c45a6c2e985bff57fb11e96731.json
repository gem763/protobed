The move ends with jumping up into a tucked position by bringing the knees towards the chest.\n\nBURPEES: She first recommended people do burpees for 20 seconds, advising them to first hit the squat position (top) before jumping out into a plank (bottom)\n\nHIGH KNEES: After doing the burpee for 20 seconds and taking a 10 second rest, people are recommended to move on to high knees\n\n'Once your feet are underneath you, jump up and bend your knees to bring them in toward your chest by using your abdominals,' she said. 'At the same time, draw your elbows in towards your knees.'\n\nKelsey recommends doing the move for 20 seconds before moving on to high knees, the next move in the four-part cardio series.\n\nFor high knees, the fitness trainer advises for people to keep their elbows tucked into their sides while the lower portion of the arm is extended outwards over the mat with the palms facing down.\n\nEach knee should then attempt to hit the palm of the hand when getting pulled up towards the chest.\n\n'Keeping your weight in the balls of your feet, start lifting your knees to tap your hands, alternating sides,' Kelsey told the publication.\n\nTHE SPRAWL: Then the next move in the cardio series is called a sprawl. It entails someone first hitting the squat position (pictured)\n\nTHE SPRAWL: After hitting the squat, it is advised to place the arms down on the mat and jumping back into a plank (pictured) before then propelling the body back into a squat\n\nJUMP SQUAT: Then the final exercise in the cardio series is a jump squat. Participants first hit the squat position (left) before jumping straight into the air (right)\n\nThis exercise should continue for 20 seconds before transitioning to the third move of the series, the sprawl.\n\nThe third move mirrors a similar body position as the burpee where the participant first hits a squat before shooting their legs back into a plank. Then reverse the movement to bring the legs back into the squat position after briefly holding the plank.\n\nAgain, this move should be done for 20 seconds before moving onto the fourth and final move of the series.\n\nKelsey's last cardio move for the HITT series is the jump squat.\n\nShe advises jumping up towards the ceiling and straightening the legs before landing back down into a squat position.\n\nThis move is done for 20 seconds before finishing the first round of the workout.\n\nKelsey recommends taking a 10 second break between each move and running the entire workout for as long as someone is comfortable in order to break a sweat and get the heart rate up.", "description": "Kelsey Wells works as a fitness trainer who transformed her body postpartum.
