The fields have a capacity of 500,000 barrels per day.\n\nWhile that\u2019s unlikely to hit the world market directly because both countries are still committed to the OPEC+ deal, it would raise the amount of spare capacity available to OPEC.\n\nOne modest hope of support for prices has come in the quarterly reports of the oilfield services companies, where both Halliburton (NYSE: ) and rival Schlumberger (NYSE: ) reported sharp drops in U.S. drilling in the three months to September. Halliburton said North American revenues were down 11% on the year, while Schlumberger on Friday took a $1.6 billion charge against its U.S. pumping business.\n\n\u201cThese results from Halliburton bring into crystal-clear focus the speed with which North America (NAM) land well construction and completion activity eroded during course of Q3,\u201d Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts wrote in a note.\n\n- Reuters contributed to this report", "description": "Oil Prices Tumble Again on Oversupply Fears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0R0GY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
