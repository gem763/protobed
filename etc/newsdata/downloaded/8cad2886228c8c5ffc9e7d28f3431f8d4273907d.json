It's up to me or it's up to Mr. Truchon or other people like us to decide if we prefer the quality of life to the quantity of life,\" Gladu said.\n\nThe 74-year-old, who uses a wheelchair, has post-polio syndrome, a condition that has weakened her muscles and reactivated her childhood scoliosis. At this point, even breathing has become difficult, she said, but her death isn't imminent.\n\nQuebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin determined provisions in the existing federal and provincial assisted-dying laws that require death to be \"reasonably foreseeable\" are an infringement on the \"life, liberty and security of the person\" under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nBaudouin gave the federal and provincial governments six months to come up with something new before suspending that provision of the laws.\n\n\"It's up to people \u2026 like us to decide if we prefer the quality of life to the quantity of life,\" said Nicole Gladu.<br><br>She says yesterday's decision that parts of Quebec's assisted dying law are unconstitutional has given her that freedom.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/polqc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#polqc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0NVLqHPki8\">pic.twitter.com/0NVLqHPki8</a> \u2014@CBCMontreal\n\nIt also granted an exemption to Gladu and Truchon that allows them to apply for medically assisted death immediately.\n\nWhen asked about her next steps, Gladu said she is still \"digesting\" the judgment and wants to consult with her friends before deciding what to do.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Gladu said. \"It's a politician's answer, but believe me, I don't know.\"\n\nSpeaking through a friend, given his own difficulties with speech, Truchon said he will live through the winter and spring and, \"after that, we'll see.\"\n\nTruchon, who has cerebral palsy and no longer has the use of his four limbs, said the ruling represents a \"victory for social justice\" and gives people the right to die, which he sees as \"a privilege.\"\n\nTruchon, who has cerebral palsy, has been fighting for the right to have access to medically assisted dying.
