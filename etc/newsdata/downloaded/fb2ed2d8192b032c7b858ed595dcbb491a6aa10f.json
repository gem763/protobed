HMNY, -10.00% , the corporate parent of the service that sought to give users unlimited entry to films at the theater as they wanted for a monthly subscription price, announced Friday afternoon that it would shutter the service as of Saturday. The company\u2019s board is reviewing options, including selling the entire business or just MoviePass.\n\nThe service has been inactive since shutting down just ahead of the July 4 weekend, which Helios & Matheson said at the time was a pause to update the app and \u201crecapitalize\u201d the struggling movie-subscription business. In Friday\u2019s announcement, though, the company said that \u201cits efforts to recapitalize MoviePass have not been successful to date.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Company is unable to predict if or when the MoviePass service will continue,\u201d the two-paragraph statement reads. \u201cThe Company is continuing its efforts to seek financing to fund its operations. There can be no assurance that any such financing will be obtained or available on terms acceptable to the Committee.\u201d\n\nHelios & Matheson was a sleepy data-analytics company when it acquired MoviePass about two years ago. The service had just 20,000 subscribers at the time, but rapidly began amassing new users after Helios & Matheson amassed its large stake and slashed the MoviePass monthly fee to $9.95 from up to $50 a month, eventually crossing the 3 million mark.\n\nHelios & Matheson stock multiplied by more than 10 as investors jumped in on the movie-subscription business, but the warnings of big losses from paying full price to theaters so people could see as many movies as they want every month for roughly the price of one ticket eventually came true. Helios & Matheson was recording cash deficits of more than $20 million a month, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFor more: The spectacular rise and fall of MoviePass\n\nThe movie-theater companies, which had initially scoffed at the idea of MoviePass, instead became competitors. AMC Entertainment Holding Inc. AMC, +2.22% , for example, introduced a new tier to its loyalty program, AMC Stubs, that allows users to see up to 3 movies a week for $19.95 a month. On the anniversary of launching that service in June, AMC said that 860,000 people had signed up for the A-list service.\n\nHelios & Matheson executives previously said that they knew the service would lose money, but expected to make it up by monetizing users\u2019 data and selling advertising for movies and theater chains. That plan didn\u2019t pay off, though, and the company\u2019s stock has plunged even amid splits that sought to shore up the price. Shares, which sell for a fraction of a penny, fell 10% at the end of Friday\u2019s session, as the news was announced, falling from 0.2 cents to 0.18 cents.\n\nPrevious coverage by MarketWatch staff writer Sarah Toy contributed to this article.", "description": "Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc., the corporate parent of MoviePass, announced Friday afternoon that it would shutter the service as of Saturday.
