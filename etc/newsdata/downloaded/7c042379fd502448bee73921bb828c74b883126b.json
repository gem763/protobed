I don't think I can take the bus. We can just take the Rolls if you want.'\n\nAdil, 19, from Cheshire (pictured), is the son of a self-made multi-millionaire and has never had to worry about money in his life\n\nThe wealthy heir (pictured), who has a chauffeur and has never taken public transport in his life, is baffled when he takes the bus while staying with a less privileged family-of-five in Preston\n\nAdil - the son of a self-made multi millionaire - is faced with the challenge on his last day, when Daniel - a father-of-three - announces they will be taking public transport into town.\n\n'I thought it was funny that he's never been on a bus before at 19,' says Daniel, who has spent the last five months unemployed after losing his job. 'Quite bizarre, really.'\n\nAdil adds: 'Me personally, I would never get a bus,' before exclaiming: 'Oh god, it's here.'\n\nWith encouragement from Daniel - and because the bus is the only way the family get around without a car - the heir hops on.\n\n'What does this button do?' a bewildered Adil asks, as Daniel struggles to believe he doesn't know how the bus' stop button works.\n\nExcitedly pressing the button to indicate the pair will be getting off at the next stop, Adil uses the tip of his finger, as if scared to touch anything else.\n\nAdil spends a few nights with Cheryl and Daniel Bennett and their daughters Skylar, two, Miley, seven and Elisa, five. Pictured, Adil, far right\n\nDaniel tells Adil they're going to have to take the bus to get into town, but the privileged teen isn't too keen (pictured together)\n\nOnce out on the street again, the heir shares his first impressions of public transport.\n\n'We still have to walk a lot from the bus stop to the shop,' he observes. 'I'll be honest here, I don't think I'll ever use the bus again.'\n\nThe family-of-five's modest lifestyle is a far cry away from Adil's privileged upbringing - who was offered a director job at his father's company aged 18.\n\n'I do admit I spend a lot and I should stop, but it's not happening,' Adil explains.\n\nHis family own a fleet of executive cars, including his Rolls Royce, which comes with a chauffeur named Samir.\n\nThe family's impressive six-bedroom home boasts eight bathrooms and a gold-plated dining-room - not to mention walls decorated with Swarovski crystals.\n\nAdil's parents, who spend about \u00a3200 a week on food, and \u00a3500 to \u00a3600 on drinks, also employ a full-time housekeeper, a gardener, and an occasional chef.\n\nAnd the wealthy teen admits he particularly likes to splash his cash on bags - including a \u00a32.500 Louis Vuitton weekend bag made from plastic.\n\nSamir (pictured holding an umbrella) is Adil's personal chauffeur and bodyguard and drives him around at his request\n\nDaniel takes a closer look at Adil's Rolls-Royce Cullinan and jokes he could 'live' in there. The car costs the price of two apartments in his street\n\nAt home, Adil's every need is cared for, and a house keeper looks after the house, but while staying with Daniel and Cheryl, the heir has to do the washing up\n\nAdil is challenged to buy the family-of-five's dinner for the evening under ten pounds. He goes six pounds over budget\n\nFor a few days, Daniel and Cheryl's world collide with Adil's easy outtake on life, and the privileged teen is quickly given a reality check.\n\n'It's quite shocking to see people struggling,' he admits.\n\nDuring his stay, Adil shops and cooks for the family, but fails to rustle up a dinner for a tenner - falling \u00a36 over budget instead.\n\nBut seeing Daniel and Cheryl make their monthly intake work makes Adil reflect on his own privileges.\n\n'I've never made a sacrifice before, it's clearly woken me up, now,' he says. 'It's really touched me. I feel a very big difference now.'\n\nFollowing his eye-opening experience, Adil buys the family tickets to Dancing On Ice - a present he knows will make them happy.\n\nAnd Cheryl and Daniel draw their own conclusions from living with the wealthy heir.\n\n'I think what this experience taught us is that how much money you have in the bank doesn't define who you are,' says Daniel.\n\n'It doesn't make you a bad person because you're rich. It doesn't necessarily mean you're a good person because you're not rich.'\n\nRich Kids Go Skint airs tonight at 9pm on 5Star\n\nTouched by Daniel and Cheryl's effort to buying dancing lessons for their daughters, Adil buys the family tickets to go see a dance show", "description": "Adil, 19, from Cheshire, appears on tonight's episode of Rich Kids Go Skint on Channel 5, and gets a shock when he moves in with a family-of-five in Preston who survive on \u00a3450 a month.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20286478-0-image-a-13_1572278904668.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
