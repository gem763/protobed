Over the next year, EU and British negotiators would work on a trade deal and other arrangements. \"This is a great deal for our country \u2014 the UK \u2014 and our friends in the EU,\" Johnson said Thursday night. \"Now is the moment for our parliamentarians to get this done.\"\n\nThe House of Commons will meet for a vote on Saturday, and already, the revised agreement has been rejected by the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party and dragged by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said it's an \"even worse deal\" than the one crafted by former Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nUnder U.K. law, Johnson is required to seek a Brexit extension if a deal is not approved by Saturday, but he has been adamant about leaving the EU by the Oct. 31 deadline, deal or not. One EU diplomat told The Guardian they are leaving \"the door open to the possibility of an extension,\" if needed.
