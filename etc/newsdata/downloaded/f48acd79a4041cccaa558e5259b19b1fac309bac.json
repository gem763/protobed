Mueller detailed a series of contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia.\n\nTrump, who is running for re-election next year, has called the Russia investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and has repeatedly sought to discredit it.\n\nBarr, a Trump appointee who is the top U.S. law enforcement official, is personally involved in investigating Trump\u2019s complaints that he and his 2016 campaign were improperly targeted by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe U.S. attorney general in May appointed federal prosecutor John Durham to look into the matter. U.S. Democrats have called the investigation an effort to sully the conclusions of Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies to benefit Trump politically, even as the House of Representatives pursues an impeachment inquiry arising from Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate domestic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said on Monday that Trump had contacted other countries to introduce Barr and Durham. Kupec did not name the countries in her statement, but U.S. media have said Barr made overtures to British intelligence and had visited Italy.\n\nCorriere della Sera said Barr\u2019s meetings focused on the origins of the U.S. Russia investigation and on the actions of Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese university professor, a key figure in the events that triggered the Russia probe.\n\nMifsud\u2019s present whereabouts are unknown. He was teaching at a Rome university when the scandal erupted.\n\nFormer Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, when he pleaded guilty last year to U.S. criminal charges arising from the Mueller investigation, acknowledged that Mifsud had told him in April 2016 that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton, three months before hacked emails started appearing online and harming Clinton campaign.\n\nPapadopoulos told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Clinton. Australian officials passed that information to their U.S. counterparts two months later, helping trigger an FBI probe into Russian attempts to influence the Trump campaign.\n\nThe newspaper said Barr requested that the Italian agencies provide any documentation they had gathered.", "description": "Attorney General William Barr held two secret meetings with Italian intelligence agencies as part of an investigation by President Donald Trump's administration into the origins of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 American election, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reported on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436267575&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF91145"}
