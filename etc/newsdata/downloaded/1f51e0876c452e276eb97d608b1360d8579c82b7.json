The Kurds are very well protected,\u201d Trump added. \u201cPlus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels.\u201d\n\nHe went on to attack the Kurds again, referring to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a militant organization inside Turkey also known as the PKK, as \u201cpart of the Kurds\u201d and \u201cprobably worse at terror, more of a terrorist threat in many ways, than ISIS.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, Trump appeared to be echoing Erdo\u011fan, who has regularly pushed such claims against the Kurds.\n\nThe Kurdish forces in Syria, for their part, have been forced to make awkward alliances, joining forces with Bashar Assad\u2019s Russia-backed government, in order to fight for their survival as the Turks continue a brutal offensive against them. It's not clear how many fighters have been killed since the Turkish offensive started on Oct. 9, but at least 160,000 civilians have been displaced, according to the U.N.\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s Betrayal of the Kurds Is as Incoherent as It Is Dangerous\n\nTrump left the Kurds exposed in Northern Syria when he announced that he\u2019d withdraw U.S. troops from the area. That effectively gave Turkey the green light to launch its long-threatened attack on Kurdish forces, who they argue are terrorists. Since then the administration has struggled to offer a coherent strategy for the region, vacillating between trying to broker a ceasefire and throwing the Kurds, once a key U.S. ally, under the bus.\n\nErdo\u011fan, meanwhile, has insisted that he won\u2019t back off. Sanctions or not, his country will go ahead its attack on the Kurds in Syria.\n\nThat's been a gift to ISIS, whose members have seized on the chaos. Hundreds of ISIS prisoners have escaped detention camps in Northern Syria after Kurdish forces abandoned their posts to weather the Turkish offensive.\n\nOn Wednesday Trump again tried to downplay the threat that those ISIS fighters could pose to the U.S., saying that the prisoners were released \u201cjust for effect.\u201d He also repeated his claim that ISIS escapees were primarily Europe\u2019s problem, not America\u2019s.\n\nAs Trump downplayed the crisis in Northern Syria, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were boarding a plane to Turkey to continue their effort to broker a ceasefire.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019, in Washington.
