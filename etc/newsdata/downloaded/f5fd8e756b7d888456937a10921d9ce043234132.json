He declined to back Netanyahu\u2019s bid to form a narrow right-wing and religious coalition after the April election, bringing about Tuesday\u2019s unprecedented repeat vote.\n\nNO SPEECH AT UNITED NATIONS\n\nWith Israeli politics in flux, Netanyahu canceled his annual speech at the U.N. General Assembly next week, a spokesman said, a visit that might have provided an opportunity for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Netanyahu highlighted his close ties with Trump in his election campaign.\n\nTrump told reporters in Los Angeles on Wednesday that he had not yet spoken with Netanyahu about the election, adding \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d. The Trump administration plans soon to release an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that may prove a dead letter: The Palestinians have rejected it in advance as biased.\n\nOnce the last votes are tallied, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will consult with leaders of parties that won parliamentary representation about whom to tap to try to form a government. The nominee would then have up to 42 days to do so.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a statement during a news conference in Jerusalem September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nAddressing Likud legislators on Wednesday, Netanyahu, 69, said he had met the leaders of right-wing factions, his traditional allies, and they had pledged to work in unison with him to form the next government under his stewardship.\n\nA Likud spokesman said the right-wing bloc would approach \u201call Zionist parties\u201d in the next few days to try to negotiate an alliance, and that Netanyahu did not want another election.\n\nGantz, a political newcomer, has not ruled out a unity administration with Likud. But he has said Blue and White would not join such a government if it included Netanyahu, citing looming corruption charges against the prime minister, who has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a further complication, Lieberman has rejected any alliance that includes ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties - members of Netanyahu\u2019s current caretaker government. Lieberman has sought to limit religious influence on everyday life in Israel.\n\nSpeaking after meeting his allies, Netanyahu again took aim at what he has termed \u201canti-Zionist\u201d Arab parties, saying his right-wing grouping would make \u201cevery effort\u201d to prevent the formation of a \u201cdangerous government\u201d dependent on Arab support.\n\nHe was referring to a possible Gantz-led coalition reliant on the tacit backing of Arab members of parliament, who have accused Netanyahu of racism towards their community, which comprises around 20 percent of Israel\u2019s population.\n\nA joint list of Arab parties put on a strong showing in Tuesday\u2019s election, winning 13 seats. But no Arab party has ever formally joined a coalition government in Israel.\n\nSlideshow (24 Images)\n\nThree corruption investigations and the Israeli attorney general\u2019s announced intention to charge Netanyahu with fraud and bribery have also chipped away at his seeming invincibility.\n\nNetanyahu can argue at a pre-trial hearing in October against indictment. But an election loss could leave him more at risk of prosecution in the graft cases, without the shield of parliamentary immunity that his current political allies had promised to seek for him.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to win a ruling majority in an election that produced a virtual tie between his right-wing bloc and a center-left grouping that would be led by former military chief Benny Gantz.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431283970&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1ER", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
