Partially reversing a 1.81% slide from Saturday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,055.\n\nA bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning intraday low $9,880.7.\n\nBitcoin fell through the first major support level at $9,904.27 before rallying to a late morning intraday high $10,105.\n\nFalling short of the first major resistance level at $10,160.37, Bitcoin slid back to sub-$10,000 levels.\n\nThrough the latter part of the day, support at $10,000 delivered, however, giving Bitcoin just a 2nd day in the green for the week. The bearish week left Bitcoin down by 2.59% for the week.\n\nFor the bulls, the extended bullish trend remained intact in spite of just 2 days in the green out of 10. While having tested support at the 38.2% FIB in the week, Bitcoin continued to steer well clear of the 62% FIB of 7,245.\n\nThe Rest of the Pack\n\nFor the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board.\n\nEOS and Ripple\u2019s XRP led the way down on Sunday, with losses of 4.66% and 4.54% respectively.\n\nBinance Coin (-2.82%), Stellar\u2019s Lumen (-2.02%), Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.92%), and Ethereum (-1.75%) also struggled on the day.\n\nLitecoin and Bitcoin Cash ABC saw more modest losses of 1.27% and 1.21%.\n\nFor the week, it was a mixed bag. EOS and Bitcoin Cash SV joined Bitcoin in the red, with losses of 6.45% and 0.28% respectively.\n\nIt was a bullish week for the rest of the majors, however. Stellar\u2019s Lumen and Ethereum led the way, with gains of 16.47% and 11.51% respectively.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP and Litecoin also saw solid gains for the week, with the pair up by 6.21% and 3.02% respectively.\n\nBinance Coin and Bitcoin Cash ABC saw more modest gains of 0.1% and 0.8% respectively.\n\nThrough the week, the total crypto market cap slid from a week high $273.58bn on Wednesday to a Thursday week low $261.55bn before recovering to $273bn levels late on Thursday.\n\nIt was downhill from there, however, with the crypto market cap falling back to $262bn levels. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $263.56bn.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance recovered to 68.1% following Bitcoin\u2019s trend-bucking gain on Sunday.\n\nThis Morning\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.55% to $10,000. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from an early morning high $10,077 to a low $9,964.5\n\nBitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\n\nElsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to buck the trend with a 0.21% gain. It was red for the rest of the pack, however.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen and Binance Coin led the way down, with losses of 2.07% and 1.43% respectively.\n\nFor the Bitcoin Day Ahead\n\nBitcoin would need to move through the morning high $10,077 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $10,146.43 into play.\n\nThrough the early part of the day, Bitcoin would need support from other broader market, however, to reverse the early morning loss.\n\nIn the event of a Bitcoin breakout, we would expect the second major resistance level at $10,237.87 to limit any upside.\n\nFailure to move through the morning high could see Bitcoin kick off the week in the red.\n\nA fall through the morning low $9,964.5 would bring the first major support level at $9,922.13 into play.\n\nIn the event of an extended sell-off through the day, Bitcoin could visit sub-$9,900 levels before any recovery.\n\nBarring a crypto meltdown, however, we would expect Bitcoin to steer clear of the second major support level at $9,789.27.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The crypto bears drag the majors into the red at the start of the week.
