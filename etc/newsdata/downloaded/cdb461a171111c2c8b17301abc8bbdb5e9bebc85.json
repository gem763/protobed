But it was when she came to the impact climate change had had on her own life, and on her family in Puerto Rico, that she became emotional.\n\n\n\n\u201cI speak to you as a human being, a woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children\u2019s future,\u201d she said, her voice breaking as if she was struggling to hold back tears.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat our actions are responsible for bringing their most dire possibilities into focus.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom the moment she began speaking, the main hall at the summit became completely still, and when she finished, the ovation she received far exceeded that received by the veteran climate campaigner and former vice-president Al Gore, Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen; or the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe got a rockstar welcome in that audience,\u201d Nicholas Reece, a city councillor from Melbourne, Australia, said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about her which is really mobilising and electrifying people around the world, particularly young people.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter her speech, Ocasio-Cortez joined the weekly Fridays for Future rally outside Copenhagen city hall, where she called on the gathered activists to \u201cmake sure the politicians sweat a little bit\u201d.\n\nA substantial crowd, combining local activists with mayors and youth delegates from the summit, had turned out to meet her.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to face the oil and coal industry, the CO 2 -emitting industry, Wall Street, Bolsonaro, Donald Trump,\u201d she said to cheers from the crowd. \u201cWe can\u2019t and won\u2019t win by staying home.\u201d\n\nEmily Baliozian, a youth delegate who had come to the summit from Paris, watched Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s speech despite the pounding rain.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was so empowering. It was clearly directed to us. I know it, she\u2019s going to be president one day, because we\u2019re going to be the voters of tomorrow,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super cool that she came all this way,\u201d said Selma White, 14, a regular at Copenhagen\u2019s Fridays for Future protests. \u201cIt\u2019s really inspiring.\u201d\n\n\n\nOcasio-Cortez arrived in Copenhagen on Wednesday morning and immediately began posting images of the city to her 4 million followers on Instagram.\n\n\n\nShe was invited to attend a royal dinner hosted by Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and his wife, Princess Mary, at the city\u2019s Christiansborg Palace on Thursday evening.\n\n\n\nBut she stayed away from the summit itself until the moment she delivered her speech.", "description": "Congresswoman said world needs to adopt \u2018a cooperative, collaborative\u2019 system at C40 World Mayors summit in Copenhagen", "authors": ["Richard Orange"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8608644c0dd032dd2d690461dec7e59c67cfc23b/0_361_5324_3194/master/5324.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5bf3cf406e1661a2fa7674f7c29a2792", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
