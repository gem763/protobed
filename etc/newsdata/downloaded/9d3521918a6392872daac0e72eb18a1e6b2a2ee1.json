The commission found that only the New Orleans ferry subsidy, at $9.88 a trip, exceeded New York City\u2019s own per-ride subsidy of $9.34.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNew Orleans and New York City, however, are national outliers among the nine ferry systems that each serve more than 1 million passengers a year.\n\nThe Citizens Budget Commission\u2019s numbers, coupled with the city's recent acknowledgment that most of its ferry riders have healthy salaries, point to one of the most frequent questions transit advocates ask about the NYC Ferry: If its riders can afford to pay more, why not charge them more \u2014 like the $6.75 riders pay for the express bus \u2014 and free up money for other pressing transit needs?\n\n\u201cThe key difference between NYC Ferry and the other ferry systems is that the other ferry systems have much higher fares,\u201d said Sean Campion, a senior research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission.\n\nA one-way trip on the NYC Ferry costs $2.75. A ride on the San Francisco Bay Ferry, however, costs between $7.20 and $15.90. A ride on the Golden Gate Ferry costs about $13. The per-trip subsidies for those are a bit more than $4 a ride.\n\nThose ferry services are \u201ccertainly a premium service, and the fares to an extent reflect that,\u201d said Ian Griffiths, co-founder of Seamless Bay Area, a transit advocacy group.\n\nOne reason that de Blasio\u2019s ferry service has proven so controversial among transit types is that even as he is subsidizing a premium service for people who arguably don't need as much of a subsidy, he has allowed the New York City bus system, on which many more people rely, to languish.\n\nDe Blasio launched his ferry service in 2017, as the subways were cratering and the bus system was losing ridership. While riders and transit operators were grappling with a transit crisis of generational proportions, de Blasio cast his ferries as a viable alternative to the governor\u2019s languishing MTA, which runs buses on New York City streets. The mayor even pegged the fare to the price of a subway or bus ride, at $2.75 a trip, to make ferries \u201caffordable to everyday New Yorkers just like our subways and buses.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the very same time as our subways were more and more congested and our roads were more and more congested, this was something that needed to happen for a long time,\u201d said de Blasio in January.\n\nBut de Blasio\u2019s rhetoric has had only passing relationship with reality. Ferries may be a boon for some coastal New Yorkers, and they may even make good sense in a city bound by water, but experts agree they carry far too few people to be a real solution to the region\u2019s transit or traffic congestion crises.\n\nIn 2017, local MTA buses provided 691 million trips. Most of its riders are low-income New Yorkers of color, just the sort of New Yorkers de Blasio purports to represent. The city projects de Blasio\u2019s ferries will provide 4.6 million trips this year.\n\n\"It just seemed the mayor was punting on going after street space,\" said Benjamin Kabak, the author of the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog and a frequent critic of the ferry system.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s claims that the ferry would correct \u201cinequities,\u201d also seemed far-fetched, except in strictly geographical terms. Thanks to the lack of a uniform fare payment system, riders transferring from ferries to a MTA bus or subway had to pay the $2.75 fare twice, instead of just once as they do when transferring between buses and subways. As many suspected, and a study released last week confirmed, riders of the ferry system are mostly middle-class, white New Yorkers.\n\n\u201cIt stings that the \u2018Tale of Two Cities\u2019 mayor is the one who rolled [the ferry] out,\u201d said Stephen Smith, a former transportation writer who now works in real estate. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious why he did, because it was something he could do without any MTA input at all. But part of being mayor is doing difficult things, like wrangling bureaucracies that don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you.\u201d\n\nAs de Blasio was touting the benefits of his ferry service, advocates were asking him to create truly dedicated bus lanes, too \u2014 ones that other vehicles couldn\u2019t block with ease. Bus ridership has fallen in recent years, and some advocates fear a death spiral, with falling ridership catalyzing service cuts, which, in turn, could catalyze more riders to abandon the bus.\n\nThey saw the bus-ferry funding discussion as \"zero sum,\" said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a guy who\u2019s put a ton of money into ferries and BQX and has done little to improve road infrastructure for buses,\u201d said Sifuentes, referring to the mayor\u2019s slow-moving light-rail plan. \u201cIf the mayor did a little bit of everything \u2014 more money for ferries, more money for these projects like BQX, and real money for projects like bus infrastructure, I don\u2019t think anyone would have a problem with that. Or at least, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe de Blasio administration argues that after it launches more ferry lines, it will be able to drive the per-trip subsidy down to between $7 or $8, which would be more in line with the per-trip subsidy on the Long Island Rail Road.\n\nIn a statement, City Hall spokesperson Seth Stein said the mayor \u201cis laser focused on getting New Yorkers moving ... any claim otherwise is blind to the facts,\u201d and he\u2019s embracing an \u201call-of-the-above approach to our transportation system.\u201d\n\nStein pointed to the mayor\u2019s promise to increase bus speeds 25 percent by the end of 2020 and his recent support for Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s congestion pricing plan.\n\nBut last week, even as he launched the city\u2019s most \u201caggressive\u201d bus lane in history \u2014 on 14th Street \u2014 the mayor's rhetoric suggested he had no plans to apply that approach anywhere else, anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI said I accept this as a pilot and only as a pilot,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to see what those results are and it\u2019s going to tell us whether it\u2019s something we want to do other places, and some places might be ripe for it and other places not, obviously. But no, the jury is out.\u201d\n\nAdvocates don\u2019t begrudge the mayor a ferry system, exactly, but they do begrudge him sentiments like that.\n\n\"To me, at least, the way to fix this is just remove some of the subsidy on the fares,\" said Kabak. \"I don\u2019t think ... the mayor has made a particularly convincing case that we need to be subsidizing this fare to the point it's $2.75 forever.\"", "description": "A one-way trip on the New York ferry costs $2.75.
