This has encouraged a sense of impunity among wrongdoers \u2013 and dismay among victims.\n\nAhrar al-Sharqiya, the Turkish-backed rebel group allegedly responsible for killing nine civilians near Tel Abyad at the weekend, exemplifies this phenomenon. It was previously accused of abusing civilians, including forced disappearances and looting, during last year\u2019s Turkish-led occupation of Afrin in north-west Syria.\n\nFighters in Jaish al-Sharqiyah, another faction attached to the rebel Free Syrian Army, were also accused of human rights abuses in Afrin. FSA officials later pledged action would be taken against those responsible. But according to a Human Rights Watch report, this never happened.\n\nTurkey\u2019s proxy forces are not alone in committing alleged war crimes in Syria. A military offensive last spring in Idlib province in north-west Syria by Syrian and Russian forces caused hundreds of civilian deaths, and displaced tens of thousands of people. In one episode, four hospitals were deliberately targeted by Russian bombers in the space of 12 hours.\n\n\u201cIntentional attacks against civilians are war crimes, and those who have ordered them or carried them out are criminally responsible for their actions,\u201d Michelle Bachelet, the UN\u2019s human rights chief, declared in July. Mark Lowcock, another senior UN official, angrily accused UN security council members of \u201cdoing nothing for 90 days as the carnage continues in front of your eyes\u201d. But a UN board of inquiry into Idlib has yet to report its findings.\n\nBashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s president, has frequently been accused of war crimes through illegal use of chemical weapons. One of the most notorious incidents occurred in the town of Khan Sheikhun, where nearly 100 people died in a sarin gas attack in April 2017.\n\nThe international chemical weapons watchdog officially blamed the regime for the attack, as did the US and Britain. But Assad flatly denied it, Russia said the incident was staged \u2013 and no one has been held to account.\n\nDonald Trump and other western leaders have also faced war crimes controversies, for example over airstrikes in Raqqa and Mosul during coalition operations against Islamic State. Unknown numbers of civilians died in the bombings. Yet their deaths have not been investigated or, in Britain\u2019s case, even acknowledged.\n\nWhen it comes to war crimes, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Trump, Assad, the Russian and US air forces and the rebel militiamen in Tel Abyad all have one thing in common: they are unlikely to face prosecution. The culture of impunity stretches from the top to bottom.\n\nThe international criminal court, which has lead responsibility for investigating war crimes, lacks authority and is not officially recognised by the US, Russia, Turkey or Syria. The UN\u2019s international commission of inquiry on Syria, created in 2011, has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights law \u2013 but Assad\u2019s refusal to cooperate has stymied it.\n\nIn practice, hopes of justice for war crimes victims mainly rely at present on independent, non-government organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Syria Campaign and the Commission for International Justice and Accountability that collect and document evidence and witness statements that could be used in future prosecutions.\n\nRecent history suggests most culprits will escape justice, including the killers now on the rampage around Tel Abyad. But this may be changing. Groundbreaking cases brought in Germany and France this year against alleged Syrian state torturers, which are expected to go to trial, have raised hopes the law is slowly catching up with the lawless.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "After the latest atrocity by pro-Turkey forces, the long era of impunity may be near an end", "authors": ["Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf37e08ff06d0bb12fc99f43f82a479085185844/0_211_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c610746bc795e65c8560359923887694", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
