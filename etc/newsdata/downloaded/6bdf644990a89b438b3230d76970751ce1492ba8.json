I want to say that the Wall Street Journal\u2014the editor there who went to my wedding, Matt Murray\u2014the reporters, who are probably good reporters, but they couldn\u2019t wear my jockstrap as a reporter or hold it, I think hold it is the term,\u201d he boasted.\n\n\u201cUhh, where are we going?\u201d Fox Business anchor Neil Cavuto wondered, speaking for all of us. (Also, side note, as Journal reporter Joe Flint asked: Does Gasparino wear a jockstrap to work every day?)\n\n\u201cHere is the thing,\u201d Gasparino continued. \u201cThey won\u2019t cite us breaking the story two days ago but it was my producer, Lydia Moynihan, who beat the hell out of the Wall Street Journal\u201dand at least\u2014I know they\u2019re mad that 14 years ago I left them in the dust, that I went to work other places including here\u2014but get over it! Give Lydia\u2014you took her story!\u201d\n\nAfter his colleague suggested the Journal was holding a 14-year-old grudge against him for leaving the paper, Cavuto calmly pointed out that the newspaper is corporate partners with Fox.\n\n\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Gasparino huffed. \u201cYou took her story. Give her credit!\u201d\n\nGasparino would go on to spend the next few moments scolding the Wall Street Journal for not giving his producer due credit for breaking the AT&T-DirecTV story. Cavuto, meanwhile, reminded the Fox Biz correspondent that \u201cwe all breathe the same air\" while pondering \"how much more\" Gasparino can destroy his career.\n\n\u201cListen when they break stories\u2014the Wall Street Journal does this\u2014we say it,\u201d an undeterred Gasparino replied. \u201cRight? Don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cavuto mumbled as Gasparino laughed before tossing to commercial break.", "description": "Neil Cavuto calmly pointed out that Wall Street Journal is a corporate partner with the Fox Business Network.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568918446/cavuto-coast-coast_3_poxout", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
