(Elise Amendola/Associated Press)\n\nThe Dolphins, as you may have heard, appear to be tanking and are coming of a dismal 59-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe Patriots stomped the Steelers to open the season and are about to acquire the services of wide receiver Antonio Brown.\n\nThese two teams play each other on Sunday in Week 2, and Vegas is acting accordingly: As of Monday afternoon, the Patriots are 16.5-point road favorites over the Dolphins, a number that could grow as the week goes on and more money comes in on the defending Super Bowl champions.\n\nThat type of number isn\u2019t seen all that much in the NFL. In fact, the Patriots were the last team to be favored by at least 17 points on the road back in 2007, when New England went undefeated in the regular season. According to Pro Football Reference, the Patriots were 18.5-point favorites over the Ravens for a Week 13 game in Baltimore but failed to cover the big number, winning by just three in a game the Ravens led in the fourth quarter.\n\nSuch big road favorites have not been good betting propositions over the years. Here are the six biggest in Pro Football Reference\u2019s database:\n\nGame Date Spread Score Favorite cover? 49ers at Falcons 10-11-87 49ers by 23 49ers 25, Falcons 17 No Patriots at Ravens 12-3-07 Patriots by 18.5 Patriots 27, Ravens 24 No 49ers at Patriots 10-11-92 49ers by 17.5 49ers 24, Patriots 12 No Bills at Colts 11-29-92 Bills by 16.5 Colts 16, Bills 13 (OT) No Titans at Browns 12-17-00 Titans by 16 Titans 24, Browns 0 Yes Patriots at Bills 11-18-07 Patriots by 16 Patriots 56, Bills 10 Yes\n\nIn all, favorites of at least 17 points \u2014 home or away \u2014 are 19-30-3 against the spread, per Pro Football Reference\u2019s database. Favorites of at least 19 points \u2014 and the Patriots could still get there by Sunday \u2014 are just 2-12 against the spread.\n\nThere\u2019s also New England\u2019s recent performances in Miami, which have not been great:\n\nSeason Spread Score Patriots cover? 2018 Patriots by 9.5 Dolphins 34, Patriots 33 No 2017 Patriots by 10.5 Dolphins 27, Patriots 20 No 2016 Patriots by 7.5 Patriots 35, Dolphins 14 Yes 2015 Patriots by 9 Dolphins 20, Patriots 10 No 2014 Patriots by 5 Dolphins 33, Patriots 20 No 2013 Dolphins by 2.5 Dolphins 24, Patriots 20 No 2012 Patriots by 9 Patriots 23, Dolphins 16 No\n\nSo what I\u2019m saying, Miami, is that there\u2019s a chance. Maybe not a chance to win, but a chance to keep things within the point spread.\n\nRead more:\n\nAntonio Brown and the Patriots are a match so crazy it just might work\n\nNFL players increasingly want to use their leverage, and realize how little they have\n\nHow Kyler Murray went from a 5-foot-5 high school star to NFL\u2019s most anticipated QB\n\nCowboys didn\u2019t play hardball with Ezekiel Elliott.
