The EU has said that it will retaliate against any Airbus-linked tariffs when the WTO rules early next year on a similar dispute over subsidies the U.S. supplied to Boeing Co.\n\nAnd while the EU\u2019s top trade negotiator, Cecilia Malmstrom, said she\u2019s hopeful a settlement can be reached that would avoid a tit-for-tat tariff escalation, the bloc has already published a preliminary list of U.S. goods -- from ketchup to video-game consoles -- being targeted in a $12 billion plan for retaliatory levies related to the Boeing case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still in favor of a settlement,\u2019\u2019 Le Maire said. \u201cBut the American administration must be aware that if there is not a settlement, Europe will not have any other choice but to retaliate and to put sanctions.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in the interest of Europe to enter into a trade war with the U.S. and I strongly believe too that it\u2019s not in the interest of the U.S.,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n--With assistance from Viktoria Dendrinou, Nikos Chrysoloras and Caroline Connan.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Maria Tadeo in Madrid at mtadeo@bloomberg.net;Stephanie Bodoni in Luxembourg at sbodoni@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Richard Bravo, Nikos Chrysoloras\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
