But after videos showed that Mayfield did shake hands with Sherman, the defensive star changed his tune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely my bad,\u201d Sherman said Wednesday during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show. \u201cI never want anybody to have to deal with some stuff that they didn\u2019t do. And so, you know, the questions that he\u2019s gonna get and the annoying, nonsense questions about some stuff that happened in a game that\u2019s already been done, you know, sure he\u2019ll get an apology for that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably reach out to him via text or social media to actually get ahold of him and talk to him in person, I mean on the phone. But, yeah, because that sucks. Yeah, yeah, he definitely deserves an apology, and that\u2019s my bad on that.\u201d\n\nMayfield threw two interceptions - one by Sherman in the first quarter - as the Browns were trounced 31-3 by the unbeaten 49ers.\n\nSherman said he still feels insulted by Mayfield, but that he probably should have \u201cphrased it differently\u201d during a postgame interview.\n\nMayfield will meet with reporters following practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Richard Sherman is backpedaling after blitzing Baker Mayfield.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/browns_49ers_football_67670_c0-158-3782-2363_s1770x1032.jpg?05f6137234f202e48854883e2f49c6d0b1c653b7", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
