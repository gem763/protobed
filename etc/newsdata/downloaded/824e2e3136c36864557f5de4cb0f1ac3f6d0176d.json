When one of the pro-life activists walked behind the vandal\u2019s car to take down his license plate, the man reacted by disclosing his full name and encouraged the pro-life group to \u201ccome find\u201d him.\n\nActivists from the pro-life organization, Created Equal, were confronted over the summer by 31-year-old David Jarvis, who willingly identified himself after he tore down pro-life banners that the pro-life group had been displaying on an overpass in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCreated Equal oftentimes displays images of aborted babies to raise awareness about the realities surrounding abortion.\n\n\u201cCome find me. David Jarvis,\u201d said Jarvis after he tore the pro-life banners down, moments before getting into his car and driving away. The Created Equal team later called the police, who arrived at Jarvis\u2019 place of employment where they found the aggressor in his office \u2014 fulfilling his request.\n\nThe June 23 incident, as well as Jarvis\u2019 interaction with police \u2014 courtesy of the Columbus Police Department \u2014 was caught on video, and shared to social media by the pro-life organization.\n\nWatch below:\n\n\u201cPut your hands on me and I\u2019ll sue the fucking piss off you. Trust me,\u201d said Jarvis to the pro-life activists, before tearing their banners down. \u201cFuck you \u2014 come find me. David Jarvis.\u201d\n\nLater in the video, two police officers can be seen arriving at Jarvis\u2019 workplace to question him about his behavior.\n\n\u201cI saw some offensive imagery, and, uh, didn\u2019t feel it was necessary for everyone on their way to work this morning to see,\u201d explained Jarvis to the officers. \u201cSo, I pulled back up, and I pulled some signs down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know that they have a right to do that, right?\u201d asked one of the officers.\n\n\u201cThey do have a right,\u201d conceded Jarvis. \u201cI get it, yes. I can acknowledge that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so, you know that what you did \u2014 lawfully \u2014 you know you had no legal grounds to do what you did, you understand that, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 what did \u2014 what?\u201d reacted Jarvis, seemingly taken aback at the suggestion that he may have broken a law.\n\nJarvis told the officers that while he knows what he did \u201cwasn\u2019t right,\u201d he wasn\u2019t aware that he had broken any laws. The officer then asked if Jarvis made any threats toward the pro-life activists.\n\n\u201cYes, I said if you touch me, I\u2019ll fucking sue the piss out of you,\u201d said Jarvis, laughing. \u201cI told them my name. I said, \u2018come find me.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know what could possibly go into your head, thinking that was a good idea,\u201d said a second officer. \u201cYour personal opinions of abortion are yours, just like their personal opinions of abortion are theirs. They\u2019re lawfully allowed to do that. They\u2019ve been doing it for weeks, if not months.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you did was wrong, legally wrong. You can\u2019t do that. They\u2019re lawfully protesting. That\u2019s their right\u201d the officer continued. \u201cIf they would have talked to you the way you talked to them \u2014 and threatened them? What would you have done?\u201d\n\nThe officer then informed Jarvis that he could possibly be sued by the pro-life activists.\n\n\u201cBring it. I don\u2019t care,\u201d reacted Jarvis.\n\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s that kind of attitude that got you where you\u2019re at right now,\u201d said the officer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at my office,\u201d quipped Jarvis.\n\nThe vandal is later seen standing outside with the officers, as they write him a ticket.\n\n\u201cDo they have to have a permit or anything to do that?\u201d inquired Jarvis after receiving his ticket.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the officer. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re not obstructing traffic.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, because I\u2019m gonna be a pain in their ass,\u201d affirmed Jarvis. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t just hang signs without the DOT [Department of Transportation] approving them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re not in the street,\u201d noted the officer.\n\nCreated Equal told Breitbart News in a statement that the organization is working with prosecutors to press charges against Jarvis.\n\n\u201cDavid Jarvis has been charged with criminal damage/endangering, a second-degree misdemeanor,\u201d said Created Equal to Breitbart News, \u201cJarvis is surprisingly pleading \u2018not guilty\u2019 despite multiple videos showing evidence of his crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cPro-abortion activists are losing the argument, and instead of seeking debate they are escalating the violence on peaceful preborn defenders,\u201d said Created Equal president Mark Harrington. \u201cWe will never cave to acts of violence or intimidation. We will return hate with love for mothers and their babies.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "A man took a detour on his way to work to tear down several pro-life banners that he had seen hanging on an overpass in Columbus, Ohio.
