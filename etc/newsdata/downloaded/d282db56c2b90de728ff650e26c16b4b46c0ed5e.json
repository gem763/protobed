The Foreign Ministry has repeatedly warned other nations against interfering in Hong Kong, reiterating that it was an \"internal affair\".", "description": "Hong Kong set for more subdued weekend of protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9O05C-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
