Souls, even baseball-loving souls, are not that tightly connected. But if a crowd of such size could articulate, with perfect diction and in unison, its deepest desire suddenly turned into a firm belief, those words would\u2019ve been, \u201cIt\u2019s finally going to happen!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt,\u201d of course, has not happened yet \u2014 the return of a Washington baseball team to the World Series for the first time since 1933.\n\nBut the Nationals now lead this best-of-seven NLCS, 3-0. So far, St. Louis has been squashed flatter than a stack of 25 Cards. One more win is required to visit the World Series for the fourth time in Washington history, joining 1933, 1925 and 1924.\n\nHowever, this old game has been holding postseason tournaments since 1903, and this is the number of times that a team trailing 3-0 in a seven-game series has come back to win: one.\n\nSo many people have waited so long for this. I don\u2019t even think owner Ted Lerner remembers the 1933 World Series \u2014 he was only 8.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe always talks about going to the 1937 All-Star Game at Griffith Stadium as an early memory,\u201d said principal owner Mark Lerner, Ted\u2019s son. \u201c[Tuesday] is my father\u2019s 94th birthday. I want it so bad for my dad. It\u2019d bring us all to tears.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd cheers.\n\n\u201cThe fans have definitely showed up,\u201d all-star third baseman Anthony Rendon said. \u201cHey, standing room only \u2014 let \u2019em in. The more the merrier.\u201d\n\nThis night had the feeling of a three-hour celebration more than a competition. The Nats beat not only the Cardinals but their ace Jack Flaherty, the pitcher with the best ERA in the NL in the second half of the season: 0.94. The Nats moved that decimal point one space, up to 9.00 for the night, with four runs in just four innings.\n\nAD\n\nAll night, the crowd, often standing on two-strike counts, implored pitcher Stephen Strasburg, a symbol of Nats power himself, to ring up another strikeout. He obliged, fanning 12 in seven innings without yielding an earned run.\n\nHowever, it was the eruptions for Nats runs that had a visceral, utterly uninhibited, doubt-free sense of release like nothing before in the 15 years since big league ball returned to Washington. This is not the teams of 2012, or 2014, or 2016 or 2017 that, despite 95 to 98 wins, found ways to not get past the division series. This is the team that has already won three elimination games this October \u2014 over Milwaukee in the wild-card game and in Games 4 and 5 to shock the Los Angeles Dodgers, a team most believed to be far superior.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing pressure games for months,\u201d said Rendon, who\u2019s hitting .379 in this postseason with an 1.109 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. \u201cWe just want to ride the wave as long as we can.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the fifth inning Monday, just as he had in the fourth, Kendrick rifled an identical-trajectory petrified rope of a double \u2014 this time off the left-center field wall \u2014 to drive in Rendon, who had a single, double and walk. Next, Ryan Zimmerman, the dignified old soldier of the bunch, drilled another double to score Kendrick for a 6-0 lead.\n\nVictor Robles homered in the sixth for a 7-0 lead that sounded tantamount to a forfeit with Strasburg on the mound. The blast got the whole place standing \u2014 a posture the fans seldom abandoned for the rest of the evening.\n\nIf this night had a symbolic moment \u2014 not just for the present, but for the future \u2014 it came in the seventh inning. The Cardinals, on three singles and an outfield slip for an error by Juan Soto, finally scored a run off Strasburg. Manager Dave Martinez came to the mound.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou grabbed your hamstring,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cNo, I cramped up. I want to stay,\u201d Strasburg replied.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . in . . . the . . . game,\u201d Strasburg said.\n\n\u201cLet him finish [the inning],\u201d catcher Kurt Suzuki said.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nStrasburg struck out the next two Cardinals, Nos. 11 and 12. His career postseason ERA is now back to 1.10 after allowing no earned runs in seven innings.\n\nThe standing ovation he received is the kind that contributes to keeping players who have an opt-out in their contracts \u2014 the kind of player like Strasburg, who has such a clause for after this season \u2014 from considering such departures too seriously.\n\nAD\n\nThe respect and affection that Strasburg has earned in Washington is something it might take him another 10 seasons to capture in another town. After his 21 wins this season, including three so far in the playoffs, and the astronomical likelihood that he will have been the Nats\u2019 No. 1 horse in reaching the World Series, it is almost unthinkable that the Lerner family, Strasburg and his agent will not be able to massage his deal enough to keep him in D.C., perhaps even beyond his current \u201cfinal\u201d year of 2023, much like the Dodgers extended Clayton Kershaw under similar circumstances after he had helped the Dodgers reach the World Series.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats crowd also did its best \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d chants for Rendon, who in addition to his hitting made one of his most amazing dive-left, reflex-stab, snag-it-after-it\u2019s-past-you robberies at third base.\n\nRendon, who is in his walk year, is a trickier proposition. But it is a truism in baseball that the further a team goes in October, especially if it makes the World Series, owners suddenly find additional funds to keep stars because . . . they deserve it.\n\nAD\n\nA franchise that has not been to a World Series within the memory of anybody younger than Ted Lerner can feed off that success at the box office for years. Whatever Rendon contract talks are at, just add 10 percent or so and make the whole Nats Nation jubilant.\n\nYou think, perhaps that there is no Nationals Nation? Wait until you wake up the morning after the Nats win one more game against the Cardinals. Immigration requests to that happy country, no longer plagued by playoff doubts, may be a long list indeed.\n\nAD\n\nFor the final memory of a night that sets the stage for unexpected glory, perhaps soon, for a team that was left for dead in late May, just recall the greeting for Strasburg as he returned to the dugout after his 12th and final strikeout.\n\nAD\n\nGerardo (Baby Shark) Parra, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and Max Scherzer cornered him \u2014 as teammates also did after his final regular season game \u2014 and encircled him in the kind of group hug that, in earlier years, might have embarrassed the self-contained Strasburg in the extreme.\n\n\u201cNot much of a hugger,\u201d Strasburg grinned afterward. \u201cBut they surrounded me.\u201d\n\nThis time \u2014 again \u2014 he seemed to love it. Why wouldn\u2019t he? After all, on Monday night, all 25 Nats, their coaches and manager, General Manager Mike Rizzo, anybody associated with this Stay in the Fight team, was encircled and trapped in an enormous hug \u2014 from 43,675 in attendance and hundreds of thousands more who would have if only their arms could stretch for miles.\n\nAD\n\nOne more win, never an easy one to get, and there will be champagne and citywide offers of appreciative kisses, too.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals and the NLCS:", "description": "A region\u2019s fan base, waiting 15 years since baseball\u2019s return and 86 since a D.C. team last appeared in the World Series, is embracing its moment.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ntd5b9hCBkMk7AGJpiMdKh1XqAY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V2Q76WXO7UI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
