Mulvaney added that once the administration was able to satisfy concerns that Ukraine was \u201cdoing better with\u201d corruption and establish that European nations were giving \u201ca considerable sum of money in nonlethal aid, once those two things cleared, the money flowed.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former officials who have been providing testimony to the House\u2019s impeachment probe paint a different picture. According to their statements as described by people familiar with their closed-door testimony, the administration was pushing for Ukrainian leaders to conduct investigations into the server and the role of former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter on the board of Ukrainian energy giant Burisma \u2014 probes Trump himself referenced in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The push was largely being driven by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, they said, whom diplomats were told to work with on Ukraine policy, according to Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who said he was disappointed by the directive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nSpeaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to say whether Giuliani had been acting in Ukraine with his blessing, arguing that it was his \u201cconsistent policy . . . not to talk about the internal deliberations\u201d of the administration. He defended the decision to bring in an outside figure like Giuliani, however, arguing that \u201cit happens all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is completely appropriate,\u201d Pompeo said, pointing out how former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took advice from Sidney Blumenthal and former ambassador Bill Richardson had been deputized to help on North Korea policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers vehemently disagree.\n\n\u201cRudolph W. Giuliani running around meeting with heads of state on behalf of the president\u2019s political interests is a profoundly shocking and important thing for us to understand,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Himes sits on the Intelligence Committee, one of three House panels conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nNot just Democrats are upset. According to the testimony of Fiona Hill, who was the top White House aide on Russia, former national security adviser John Bolton was livid at Giuliani\u2019s involvement, calling him a \u201chand grenade.\u201d\n\nBolton also wanted it known, she testified, that he refused to be a part of what he called a \u201cdrug deal\u201d between Sondland and Mulvaney, two of the three officials \u2014 along with former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker \u2014 who had been tasked to handle Ukraine policy with Giuliani after the ouster of U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe committees have not yet struck a deal with Bolton to testify in their impeachment probe, though there is significant interest among the panels conducting the investigation to have him come forward.\n\nThere appears to be bipartisan interest as well in hearing from Giuliani. Meanwhile, Pompeo said Sunday that he would \u201cdo everything I\u2019m required to do by law\u201d if asked to come forward and testify in the probe.\n\nIn the coming week, the House panels will host at least five government officials who were in some way connected to the use and redirection of Ukraine military aid, including Michael Duffey, the official at the Office of Management and Budget who signed off on the apportionment letters that froze the money.\n\nAD\n\nTrump directed Mulvaney to hold back the aid to Ukraine a week before his July 25 phone call with Zelensky, upending the traditional process of sending that money out through the State and Defense departments. In his revised statements, Mulvaney has said that the process was slowed not because of a quid pro quo but because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the level of contributions from European nations.\n\nAD\n\nFor the past five years, the Trump administration and the Obama administration have sent Ukraine increasing amounts of military aid to fend off Russian-backed separatists in its eastern provinces. Before this year, no officials raised the concerns Mulvaney cited to the point of withholding military aid until the last days of the fiscal cycle, a move by the Trump administration that alarmed diplomats and lawmakers of both parties.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that pretty much everybody who was inside the White House, from the whistleblower to all of the other witnesses who have released opening statements, had profound discomfort with what Rudolph W. Giuliani was doing and believed . . . that the military aid was being held up for the president\u2019s partisan gain,\u201d Himes said.\n\nAD\n\nRepublican lawmakers have challenged Democrats to prove that, however, arguing that the panels should be holding more proceedings in public and releasing to members the transcripts and full contents of the materials witnesses in the impeachment probe are turning over to investigators.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all being done in secret. . . . If they wanted to do an impeachment, they should be doing this out in the open,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Fox\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cThey are creating this false narrative for television. It\u2019s all for sound bites, and it\u2019s an embarrassment to the United States of America.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say that the materials will be made public, and that the delays are the result of a probe that is moving at breakneck pace and being presented every day with \u201cjaw-dropping new information\u201d \u2014 such as Mulvaney\u2019s news conference, which Democrats saw as tantamount to a confession.\n\n\u201cThere is not one word of testimony, written or spoken, which contradicts the notion that the president used the assets of the United States military aid, a White House meeting, to advance his political interests of getting Ukraine to meddling in the next, the upcoming presidential election,\u201d Himes said.\n\nKyle Swenson contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The president\u2019s top advisers defended the Trump administration Sunday on Ukraine policy as the House\u2019s Democrat-led impeachment probe heated up.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KwRo8EDXBugDrvi2aLKEqFGTlbg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GY57UGHTJQI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
