You\u2019re getting older prisoners starting big sentences and the young prison officers are coming straight from university, with very, very little life experience.\n\n\u2018And they\u2019re having to deal with major traumatic events like somebody dying in front of them or caring for somebody that is at the end of their life.\u2019\n\nThe officer\u2019s warning was echoed by the Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke, who says he expects the number of over-50s in our jails to top 14,000 by 2022.\n\nHe called for a new strategy to deal with the issue, saying elderly prisoners who are no longer an escape risk could be moved to lower-security institutions.\n\nChief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke says he expects the number of over-50s in our jails to top 14,000 by 2022\n\nHe added: \u2018The question is do they need to be held still in levels of security which are not needed for their physical capabilities and which inevitably are very expensive as well?\u2019\n\nPrisons minister Lucy Frazer told MPs yesterday that new jail wings are being built with the needs of older offenders in mind, including with wider corridors.\n\nBritain\u2019s oldest inmate is thought to be paedophile Ralph Clarke, who got a 13-year term in Birmingham in 2016, aged 101.", "description": "Paedophile retired lorry driver Ralph Clarke, 104, is believed to be Britain's oldest prisoner after he received a 13-year jail term in Birmingham in 2016.", "authors": ["David Barrett For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20060082-0-image-a-43_1571785560894.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
