She claims she was asked to leave home at just 16 after a series of rows with her parents.\n\nAfter two failed marriages and a relationship with League One footballer Luke Foster - the father of her son Taylor- she 'upgraded' in the words of a former partner, to Jamie Vardy.\n\nThe couple, who have been married since 2016, live with their five - soon-to-be-six - children in the palatial house close to Leicester, where Jamie is a striker for the city's Premier League club.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nTeen wedding bells; Rebekah Vardy wed Mark Godden in a \u00a37,000 ceremony when she was just 19; when she appeared on I'm a Celebrity in 2017, her former husband, who she was married to for just six months, said he hoped she would 'go through hell' during the reality show\n\nWags at war: Rebekah Vardy, currently heavily pregnant with her fifth child, was named by Coleen Rooney as the frenemy responsible for selling stories about her\n\nThe couple married in 2016 at luxurious Peckforton Castle in Cheshire although many of Jamie's close family didn't attend the nuptials, with Rebekah blamed for causing a rift between Jamie and his mother Lisa and stepfather Phil (Pictured at the Pride of Sport Awards, London, 2018)\n\nRebekah, 'Becky' to close friends, was first married to Mark Godden after a whirlwind romance when he was 21-years-old and she was just 18.\n\nThey met at his local pub in Witney where she was a barmaid and he was playing in the darts team.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror in 2017, he claimed they became engaged when Becky Nicholson, as she was then called, spotted a ring in a magazine and told him: 'I want that. Buy it for me.'\n\nIt's reported the pair spent \u00a37000 on their wedding on the beach in Mexico in 2001, but the union lasted just six months.\n\nRoom for the brood!

We weren\u2019t doing that badly, in my mind \u2013 living in a five-bed house, driving around in a Mercedes,' he told the Mirror.\n\nThe couple parted amicably in 2013 and Rebekah, who was working in Viper nightclub in Sheffield, a job Foster got her, soon moved on to her current love match Jamie, who she met while planning his birthday party.\n\nJust three months later, she fell pregnant with their daughter Sofia.\n\nFoster said: 'She's now got the husband she always wanted, one who can keep her in the lifestyle she's dreamt of.

She said that to my face. She said he'd treat her a hell of a lot better.'\n\nBecky and Jamie went on to wed at a lavish ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire in 2106.\n\nBut many of her husband's close family stayed away, with Rebekah blamed for causing a rift between Jamie and his mother Lisa and stepfather Phil, who did not attend their wedding.\n\nJamie's daughter Ella, then five, was kept away from the glitzy nuptials by his former girlfriend Emma Daggett.
