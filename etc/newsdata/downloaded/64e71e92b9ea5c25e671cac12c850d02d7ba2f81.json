Cozy turtlenecks, camel coats and ankle boots make the bitter farewell to summer a little more tolerable. And the perfect accessory to that new wardrobe is polishing your nails in the season's latest hues and finishes. With so many to choose from (and so much Instagram inspiration) it can be tough to distill what those new trends are. We tapped not one, not two but four experts this season to get to the bottom of it all. Rita Remark, Essie's Lead Artist and Global Educator, Raven Wilson of Tips and Treats Nail Studio in Brampton, ON, CEO of Bio Sculpture Gel Canada Erica Nieuwenhuis, and Kassie Jones of Holdengrace in Toronto all weighed in the deeper tones, the pearlescent finishes and the '90s trends that are back for fall 2019.\n\nFrench kiss\n\nJust like bucket hats, cargo pants and brown lipstick straight from the '90s, the French manicure is coming at you. \"Classic French manicures are back this season,\" says Remark. She recommends a pink base with a crisp white tip, or off-white for a more subtle look. Jones says she's giving the French mani a twist this season, opting for the \"tip in a varying shade of the base colour.\"\n\nTry: YSL La Laque Couture Nail Lacquer in Blanc Arty, $37, Sephora\n\nGo wild\n\nAnimal prints have been all over runways for several seasons now, and they've finally made it onto nails. Whether it's a cheetah print or a tortoise shell look, there are several ways to incorporate this art into your manicure. \"Have the print cover half or just a small part of the nail, leaving the not-printed part either sheer or in a contrasting colour,\" suggests Jones. And if you're thinking this look is best left to the experts, here's some good news: you can DIY this will relative ease. Example: start with a caramel-brown base, and then dot on misshapen brown spots. Before it's completely dry, smudge the dots by running over your nails with clear polish.\n\nTry: Zoya Nail Lacquer in Foster, $12.99, Nail Polish Canada\n\nSpice it up\n\n\"Popular fall shades would all feel at home in a spice cabinet,\" says Remark of her favourite nude alternatives for fall. Colours like cayenne, cumin, cinnamon and sage are her favourites, as well as toasty almonds and caramels. For Wilson, her picks are also inspired by the season, but in more dark and rich tones, like mustard yellows, earthy greens and deep reds. \"They warm the soul in a sense and who doesn't love a set of colours that can complement any skin tone and outfit? It's the perfect accessory.\"\n\nTry: Essie Nail Polish in Soles on Fire, $11.99, Shoppers Drug Mart\n\nShades of grey\n\nGreys are a great option for fall because they're a moodier version of those more pink-toned summery nudes. But this fall, give those smoky shades a hit of the purple that was so popular on fall runways. \"We love a grey toned purple,\" says Jones, recommending deep purple-greys for fall. Nieuwenhuis agrees. \"Neutral shades with a hint of dove grey or lavender will steal the show as the 'new nudes' for fall 2019.\"\n\nTry: CND Vinylux Long Wear Nail Polish in Lilac Eclipse, $15.95, Amazon\n\nLong story\n\nLength is always a huge debate come a season change, and for fall 2019, a few trends persist. \"The coffin shape has been killing it all year and will continue to do so,\" predicts Jones, adding that it complements all hands, all colours and all kinds of nail art. For Remark, it's all about long almond or oval nails because \"they add drama.\" Nieuwenhuis has an added tip for your tips. \"Nail shape and length is so dependent on lifestyle and personal preferences,\" she says, recommending that you find a shape that flatters your natural nail shape and nail beds. If you struggle with growing out your nails, try a press-on version to get that added length.\n\nTry: Ardell Nail Addict Nail Set, $7.90, Ardell Shop\n\nMake it matte\n\n\"Matte for the win!\" says Wilson. \"A glossy finish will always be a classic, but a matte finish in the fall just does something extravagant for the style and spirit.\" Jones favours mattes in fall, too, particularly painted over a metallic polish for more of a brushed metal look, while Nieuwenhuis uses mattes for a slightly different result. \"Velvety-suede finishes add sophistication to dark colours,\" she says.\n\nTry: Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Matte Top Coat, $9.97, Walmart\n\nPearly glow\n\n\"Throwback finishes like pearl, metallic and iridescent will be very popular in polish this season,\" says Remark. But, she says that unlike their '80s predecessors, they're more sophisticated thanks to muted colours like emerald, taupe and nude. Nieuwenhuis loves a pearlescent finish as an alternative to another go-to colour. \"The trendy white nail will remain popular, but instead of a stark white, imagine a creamy white with a hint of opalescence.\"\n\nTry: Essence Shine Last & Go!
