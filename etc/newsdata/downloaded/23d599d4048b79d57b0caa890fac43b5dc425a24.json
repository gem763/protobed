Just brought my reusable mug to @Starbucks &saw staff use a disposable cup, pour it into my mug, then toss the disposable cup. Totally defeats the purpose of trying 2 reduce waste,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThen I looked around to see so many people sitting @ the cafe all w disposables! Ugh.\u201d\n\nView photos Steve Granitz/WireImage More\n\nWhile many users agreed with Silverstone on her tweet, others speculated that Starbucks may be merely following a health code.\n\n\u201cThere are sanitation considerations to take into account as far as personal mugs go. I would not be surprised to learn that the Starbucks employee was following proper sanitary protocol,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense but it\u2019s our policy. Even if you are in the cafe and come up get a refill, we are technically supposed to throw your cup away and give you a new one,\u201d wrote another.\n\nHowever, a Starbucks representative tells PEOPLE that they actually encourage partners to make beverages in reusable cups \u201cwhenever possible\u201d as part of their commitment to reduce waste. They currently offer customers a 10 cent discount on their beverage should they bring their own tumbler.\n\nDepressing!

She continued with another two tweets regarding the chain\u2019s use of non-dairy milk, an important subject to Silverstone as she is vegan herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always frustrated by extra charges for non-dairy milk. Y should we be penalized 4 making the eco-choice?\u201d she argued. \u201cIt would be amazing for @Starbucks to lead the way &consider enviro externalities associated w the dairy industry by having dairy cost + or at least = plantmilk fees.\u201d\n\nAlso!I'm always frustrated by extra charges for non-dairy milk.

In a video for the nonprofit Farm Sanctuary\u2019s Compassionate Meals program back in May 2017, Bear said his favorite thing about being a vegan is \u201cthat you don\u2019t have to eat yucky meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe amazing thing about it is that it\u2019s turned me into a health nut, because you feel so good, you feel so different,\u201d Silverstone has said of the diet choice. \u201cSo being able to do something that is good for the Earth, good for the animals and good for you all at the same time seems like such a no-brainer.
