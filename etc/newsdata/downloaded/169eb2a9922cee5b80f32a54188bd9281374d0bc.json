For our hero, the strawberry, to defeat its nemesis, a fungus called wilt, the aromatic red fruit makes a deal with the devil\u2014and duly becomes America\u2019s favorite berry. But its success relies on fumigants, toxic gases injected into the soil that kill everything in their path. So what are fumigants? What\u2019s their effect on farm workers, local communities, and the environment? And can the strawberry break free from their poisonous grip? Listen to this episode to find out.\n\nUnlike many of our favorite fruits and vegetables, we know exactly where and when the cultivated strawberry that we buy in our grocery stores and farmers\u2019 markets was born: 300 years ago in a greenhouse in Versailles, France. The scientist Patrick Edger, whom Gastropod listeners will remember from our \u201cCutting the Mustard\u201d episode, and whose recent work includes a collaborative project to assemble the strawberry genome, told us the tiny North American strawberry Fragaria virginiana accidentally crossbred with strawberries collected from Chile, Fragaria chiloensis, in the French greenhouse\u2014\u201cand then, all of a sudden, they saw this massive strawberry emerge,\u201d said Edger. \u201cAnd that really transformed the strawberry industry.\u201d", "description": "For a century, the industry has used fumigants to farm berries year-round.", "authors": ["Nicola Twilley", "Cynthia Graber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTR4FJJS/facebook.jpg?1567003291"}
