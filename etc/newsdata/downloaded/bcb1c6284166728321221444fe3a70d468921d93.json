And it should show that it is absolutely the correct, objective outcome based on the constitutional principles our democracy is built on. No doubt the judges will be accused of being political again but if people could actually look at this objectively rather than through the leave/remain lens, they would realise the judges couldn\u2019t have arrived at a different conclusion. manicswiregirl\n\n\u2018A reminder that decency still exists in the corridors of power\u2019\n\nJust when you think your country is descending into a banana-republic shit-hole, along comes beautiful British justice and reminds you that decency still exists in the corridors of power. Good times. mannyklein\n\n\u2018Surely now this is a case for a vote of no confidence\u2019\n\nSurely now this is a case for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister and the government. They sought to bypass parliament, misled the house, misled the Queen and all to avoid scrutiny of their peers and the democracy of our country. To be fair if Boris had any morality or shame at all he\u2019d resign. But of course he won\u2019t. Owlyross\n\n\u2018Terrific\u2019\n\nParliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous decision of all 11. Speakers can reconvene parliament, gov need do nothing. Terrific. Tenthred\n\n\u2018Stick that in your pipe and smoke it Johnson\u2019\n\nStick that in your pipe and smoke it Johnson. Six defeats in the HoC in a week, a majority of -44 and now the law tells him he\u2019s acted illegally, his government\u2019s claim to legitimacy does seem rather threadbare. It\u2019s remarkable that starting with Cameron we\u2019ve had the succession of the worst PMs in British history all within the space of three years and guess what, they\u2019re all Tory. kumano\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s hope this is the start of the process to achieve what is truly in the nation\u2019s best interests\u2019\n\nLooks like Boris and his cabal will be returning to the UK sooner than expected. Let\u2019s hope this is the start of the process to achieve what is truly in the nation\u2019s best interests, as opposed to the select few who seem intent on achieving Brexit no matter what the cost. briski71\n\n\u2018Time for Johnson to go\u2019\n\nProrogation was unlawful. Fantastic. Time for Johnson to go. Pity there is no opposition. Ceterumcenseo1\n\n\u2018Supporting the rule of law is something that unites our continent\u2019\n\nUnanimous. Good. The Judiciary is as one. It supports the rule of law.\n\nThat is a founding pillar of the EEC/EU. It is something uniting our continent. Something that Brexiters, (wishing to secede from international courts,) do not uphold. \u201cShe [Lady Hale] says it is for the Speaker to decide what happens next.\u201d freespeechoneeach\n\n\u2018My pride in Britain was lapsing but is a little bit restored\u2019\n\nThey get it, these judges. So good to see. And Lady Hale is explaining it all so well. My pride in being British was lapsing, but is a little bit restored. Alednam\n\n\u2018Now let\u2019s call an election\u2019\n\nMy thanks as a citizen to parliament, the supreme court and the speaker of the house for protecting our democracy from crony capitalism at it\u2019s worst. Now let\u2019s call an election, revoke A50 and consign this folly to the dustbin forever. thosefatpants", "description": "You have been reacting in the comments to judges ruling that the suspension of parliament was unlawful", "authors": ["Guardian Readers", "Rachel Obordo", "Ashley Chalmers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c2b26deaf54511492cdb41fd72963b9a5c4c1a/0_76_1612_967/master/1612.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1ac3fbf168ea9b14062a8ff2e28e5e48", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
