Its service in Chicago will end on Dec. 31.\n\n\"This decision was not made lightly,\" the company said in a statement posted Friday. \"We have had to face the hard reality that despite our efforts, we underestimated the investment and resources that are truly necessary to make our service successful in these complex transportation markets amid a quickly changing mobility landscape.\"\n\nCar2Go said that since it launched in North America in 2009, transportation has changed drastically, with options that range from \"traditional automakers to ride-hail giants to micro-mobility disrupters.\"\n\nIn Calgary, which has had Car2Go since 2012 and is the only Canadian city affected, the company informed its users Friday via a email.\n\n\"Despite our best efforts over the years encouraging the city to implement policy that better supported carshare, and amid an ongoing economic recession and an increasingly competitive marketplace, we are unable to continue operating in Calgary,\" Car2Go said.\n\n\"We deeply regret any inconvenience this decision may cause you.\"\n\nIt said the last date users would be able to start a trip in Calgary would be Oct. 31, with all trips ending no later than 11:59 p.m. MT that day.\n\nFocus shifts to Montreal, Vancouver, 3 U.S. cities\n\nCar2Go users can still use their memberships in other North American locations listed on their website.\n\nThe company said it would refocus its efforts on \"the cities that present the clearest path to free-floating carshare success\" \u2014 Montreal, Vancouver, New York City, Washington D.C., and Seattle.\n\nCar2Go stopped operations in Toronto in May 2018, blaming city hall and saying a free-floating car-sharing pilot program passed by council after months of debate was overly restrictive. Specifically, it called the parking permit fees of about $1,500 per vehicle \"unprecedented.\"\n\nCalgary Coun. Evan Woolley tweeted Friday that he had already spoken with senior transportation staff and the city was working on \"a solution to keep this important mobility option\" in the city.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken with senior transportation staff and we\u2019re working on a solution to keep this important mobility option in Calgary. <a href=\"https://t.co/86MECOexFU\">https://t.co/86MECOexFU</a> \u2014@EWoolleyWard8\n\nThe news is getting mixed reviews from Calgarians on Twitter.\n\nSuch a sad loss for mobility options in the city. \u2014@brewingrealty\n\nI am so sad!! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/car2go?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@car2go</a> has been a staple in the way I have gotten around <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/yyc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#yyc</a> since I moved here for the first time. Having and encouraging alternative modes of transportation and vehicle use are part of a healthy city. Disappointing to see that this will no longer be an option \ud83d\ude1e <a href=\"https://t.co/ck5xRWJf6R\">https://t.co/ck5xRWJf6R</a> \u2014@k_plotnikoff\n\nI'm not a user and this is the best news ever. I am sick of those people clogging up my dog park parking and using it as a parking lot for them. I am sick of them clogging up downtown parking.<br>One of my biggest pet peeves in this city now gone.<br>Next up bike lane removal!! \u2014@FinsUpSailor\n\nMore to come.", "description": "The vehicle-sharing service Car2Go\u00a0says it's pulling out of Calgary and four other North American cities\u00a0before the end of the year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4292893.1505512240!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/17c25.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
