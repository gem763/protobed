No other event since 9/11 has posed such a serious threat to the international order or challenged the conventions that the world has come to take for granted. That, one year on, the international community still knows very little about what happened is a serious source of concern. Whether all aspects of the Saudi journalist\u2019s death will ever come to light will determine what kind of world our children will live in.\n\nIn the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s demise, my administration adopted a policy of transparency. Over the past year, Turkey\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement agencies, along with diplomats and prosecutors, cooperated closely with their counterparts and took steps to keep national and international audiences informed. Turkish authorities shared their findings with Saudi Arabia as well as other countries, including the United States, Russia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. We have also cooperated with the international investigation led by Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. Finally, we have requested that Saudi Arabia extradite Khashoggi\u2019s murderers to Turkey, where they committed the crime.\n\nTurkey\u2019s response to The Post contributing columnist\u2019s killing is based on our desire to uphold the rules-based international system. Hence our refusal to let the Khashoggi murder be portrayed as a bilateral dispute between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey has always seen, and continues to see, the kingdom as its friend and ally. My administration, therefore, made a clear and unmistakable distinction between the thugs who murdered Khashoggi and King Salman and his loyal subjects.\n\nOur long-standing friendship, however, does not necessarily entail silence. Quite the contrary, as the Turkish proverb goes, \u201cA real friend speaks bitter truths.\u201d\n\nThe 15-member assassination squad that murdered Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia\u2019s Consulate in Istanbul and chopped his body into pieces served the interests of a shadow state within the kingdom\u2019s government \u2014 not the Saudi state or people. Had we believed otherwise, this atrocity would have indeed been treated like a bilateral problem. However, we continue to see what happened as a question of justice rather than politics, and maintain that national and international courts alone can deliver justice.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s assassination was a tragedy but also a blatant abuse of diplomatic immunity. That the murderers traveled on diplomatic passports and turned a diplomatic building into a crime scene \u2014 and were seemingly assisted in the attempted coverup by Saudi Arabia\u2019s top diplomat in Istanbul \u2014 set a very dangerous precedent. Perhaps more dangerous is the impunity that some of the killers seem to enjoy back in the kingdom.\n\nIt is no secret that there are many questions about the court proceedings in Saudi Arabia. The near-complete lack of transparency surrounding the trial, the lack of public access to hearings and the allegation that some of Khashoggi\u2019s murderers enjoy de facto freedom fail to meet the international community\u2019s expectations and tarnish the image of Saudi Arabia \u2014 something that Turkey, as its friend and ally, does not desire.\n\nThere is an effort underway to justify this lack of transparency with reference to national security. There is a very thick line between doing everything in one\u2019s power to deliver terrorists to justice and committing premeditated murder over the target\u2019s political views. The kidnapping of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, for example, was perfectly legitimate. Yet it would be ridiculous to suggest that Khashoggi\u2019s killing served the cause of justice in any way, shape or form.\n\nGoing forward, Turkey pledges to continue its efforts to shed light on the Khashoggi murder. We will keep asking the same questions that I raised in an op-ed for this newspaper last year: Where are Khashoggi\u2019s remains? Who signed the Saudi journalist\u2019s death warrant? Who dispatched the 15 killers, including a forensic expert, aboard the two planes to Istanbul?\n\nIt is in our best interest, and in the best interest of humanity, to ensure that such a crime is not committed anywhere again. Combating impunity is the easiest way to accomplish that goal. We owe it to Jamal\u2019s family.\n\nRead more about Jamal Khashoggi:\n\nA missing voice, a growing chorus\n\nFred Ryan: Why the world will not forget the horror of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder\n\nHatice Cengiz: My quest for justice continues.
