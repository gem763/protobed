Given the allegations of impropriety?\"\n\nSwitching the topic, Ms Arcuri replied: \"Do you want me to talk about your sex life?\n\n\"Because I would love to ask you a few questions. About who you worked with and were married and then decided to\u2026you know.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nStunned Piers suggested they could talk about his own sex life \"another time\", adding: \"I'm not the one accused of impropriety with Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London.\"\n\nGiggling Ms Arcuri asked: \"Has it been 10 minutes yet? Are you falling in love with me?\"\n\nPiers' co-host Susanna Reid then also mockingly asked if he was falling in love with the American businesswoman.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMs Arcuri repeatedly refused to answer the direct question about a sexual relationship with the now PM.\n\nShe added: \"Because the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I really am not going to answer that question.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to put myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer. I'm being used as a pawn.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nTaking to Twitter , one viewer said: \"The girl talking about @BorisJohnson is being open and honest. Piers Morgan building up to drilling her again. His approach makes people feel uncomfortable. When will @gmb get a better host?\"\n\n\"Morgans interview is embarrassing #gmb Digging and digging rather crudely,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Hahahahaha Morgan ain't getting what he wants from this woman hahahahaha he seriously is trying to get blood out of a stone ..morgan is really scraping the bottom of the barrel now\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers were surprised by Pier's conduct during the interview and took to Twitter with their complaints.\n\n\"Jennifer Arcuri gone off on a 10 minute monologue... never ever known @piersmorgan to be so silent,\" said one viewer.\n\nAnother added: \"Jennifer Arcuri on #gmb well rehearsed story, come on @piersmorgan challenge her. Something's not right.\"\n\n\"What is the point of an interview where the interviewee is giving a monologue with no challenge,\" said a third.\n\nA fourth agreed: \"This is the quietest I\u2019ve ever seen @piersmorgan\"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "The American businesswoman turned the tables on red-faced Piers Morgan when asked about her 'intimate relationship' with Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528252.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jennifer-Arcuri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
