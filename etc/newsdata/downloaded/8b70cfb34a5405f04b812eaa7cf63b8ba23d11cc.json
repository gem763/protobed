There was initial trepidation, this person said, about even having the meeting.\n\nAD\n\nTrump said that Boris Johnson asked him to set up the meeting.\n\nAD\n\nWith no prior knowledge that a meeting had been set up, Dunn\u2019s parents declined to participate, saying that a meeting should take place on British soil and at a time when they felt more prepared.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said all along we are willing to meet her, but it has to be with therapists and mediators. And that\u2019s not just for us; it\u2019s for her as well,\u201d said Charles, the mother. \u201cTo be thrown into a room together with no prior warning, that\u2019s not good for her mental health, and it\u2019s certainly not good for ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a bit of pressure, but we stuck to our guns,\u201d added Dunn, the father, explaining that Trump asked them two or three times to meet with Sacoolas.\n\nAD\n\nTrump said he met with the family in the Oval Office and thought they would want to meet the driver. \u201cI offered to bring the person in question in and they weren\u2019t ready for it,\u201d Trump said. The president said that accidents like that happen because of the difference on which sides of the road people drive. \u201cThat happens to a lot of people by the way,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nIn another televised interview with \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d on Wednesday, Charles explained how the president took her hand and agreed with her when she said to him, \u201cIf this was your son, surely you would be doing the same thing, you\u2019d be trying to get justice for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Yes, yes, I would,\u2019 \u201d she said, adding that Trump then said he would try to look at the case \u201cfrom another angle,\u201d though Dunn\u2019s parents say they are unsure as to what that means.\n\nAD\n\nTrump previously called Dunn\u2019s death a \u201cterrible accident\u201d and said driving on the wrong side of the road \u201chappens.\u201d\n\nIn remarks last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, \u201cI hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country.\u201d\n\nThe Dunn case has triggered widespread controversy in Britain and thrust the concept of diplomatic immunity under the spotlight, triggering a debate about whom it should protect and what exactly it should cover. In recent weeks, Dunn\u2019s parents have campaigned both at home and more recently in the United States to have Sacoolas cooperate with the British legal system.\n\n\u201cWe promised Harry as a family when we lost him that night that we would make sure justice was done,\u201d Charles said in remarks earlier this week.\n\nJosh Dawsey in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Dunn's parents had no idea they were to meet President Trump at the White House, much less the woman they want to return to Britain.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7b4OdN8RLvRmJZmkoXXoiK08fvU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/34RWZAXQAAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
