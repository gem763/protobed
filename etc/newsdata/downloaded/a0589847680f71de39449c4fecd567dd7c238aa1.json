He\u2019s home now,\u201d said Jose Joel at the Mexico City airport, where white-gloved ushers placed Jose Jose\u2019s coffin in a glistening vintage hearse.\n\nAccompanied by a police escort, the hearse made its way to the Palace of Fine Arts, where the coffin was placed on a red carpet beneath a giant black-and-white picture of Jose Jose with the words \u201cHow sad it was to say goodbye\u201d \u2014 the opening lyrics to his most famous song, \u201cEl Triste.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was one of a kind, unique in all the world. No one can ever, ever replace him,\u201d said Leticia Hernandez, 58, carrying a poster with photographs of the singer as the National Symphony Orchestra played his classic songs in the background.\n\n\u201cHe will live on in our hearts,\u201d said another mourner, 52-year-old Araceli Segura, through tears.\n\nThe coffin was then brought for a mass at the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico\u2019s patron saint, where Marysol sang a hymn in her father\u2019s honor.\n\n\u2013 Collective grief \u2013\n\nThrongs of mourners also gathered at a statue of the singer in his home neighborhood, Claveria, for a collective outpouring of grief.\n\nThe Mexican half of his remains will be laid to rest in a cemetery in the capital alongside those of his mother, a concert pianist.\n\nJose Romulo Sosa Ortiz, as he was born, sold more than 100 million albums in a career spanning over five decades.\n\nHe adopted the stage name Jose Jose in tribute to his father, an opera singer who was also named Jose, after his death in 1968.\n\nLiving under the constant gaze of the public, Jose Jose openly struggled with alcoholism.\n\nHe quit drinking in 1993, but health issues led him to give up singing in the early 2000s.\n\nHe moved to Miami in 1995 with Salazar.", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Thousands of tearful fans said a final goodbye in Mexico City Wednesday to superstar singer Jose Jose, whose death last month", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/ff04bc_fans-line-up-pay-tribute-late-mexican-singing-legend-jose-jose-palace-fine-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
