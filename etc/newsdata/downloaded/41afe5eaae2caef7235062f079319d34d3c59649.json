He\u2019ll try to further close that gap at Bellator 231.\n\nMowry (6-0 MMA, 2-0 BMMA), the undefeated prospect who stands 6-foot-8, returns to action on Friday when he takes on promotional newcomer Gokhan Saricam (4-0 MMA, 0-0 BMMA). It\u2019s the next chapter in his attempt to climb up the divisional pecking order, and Mowry doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s far off from being considered among the best.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m close,\u201d Mowry told MMA Junkie at Bellator 231 media day. \u201cThe only thing that separates me from the dudes that were in the (heavyweight grand prix) tournament is just fights. All those dudes, they have a lot of, \u2018Been there, done that\u2019 mileage on them. They\u2019ve fought the best dudes. Even if it wasn\u2019t all heavyweights the dudes in that bracket were super skilled and tough guys. Before too long I think I can be there.\u201d\n\nBellator 231 takes place at Mohegan Sun Arena. Mowry vs. Saricam is part of the preliminary card, which streams on MMA Junkie prior to the main card on Paramount.\n\nMowry has yet to prove himself against upper echelon heavyweight competition. A win over Saricam is unlikely to change that standing, but Mowry is more concerned about getting his experience level up. When the time comes for a big jump in, Mowry knows he has the traits to compete.\n\n\u201cI have a good chin,\u201d Mowry said. \u201cI\u2019ve sparred a lot of heavy hitters. I already knew that but it does make me deep down kind of happy that whenever the chips are down I can pull through.\u201d", "description": "Steve Mowry believes there's only one thing that separates him from the top tier names in the Bellator heavyweight division.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Samano", "The Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Mmajunkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/steve-mowry-bellator-231-pre.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
