Months later, the two announced the filing of a defamation lawsuit against the president, who had called his accusers \u201cliars\u201d looking for \u201c10 minutes of fame.\u201d\n\nThe suit recently got the go-ahead from a New York appeals court, giving new hope to a raft of Trump accusers. But Zervos and Allred didn\u2019t celebrate the victory together.\n\nThe former Apprentice contestant had split with her high-profile lawyer, and in recent months quietly filed a complaint against her with the state bar association. Now she is going public with her grievances against Allred.\n\nZervos told The Daily Beast that Allred chastised her in phone calls and belittled her in emails. And she says the attorney refused to disclose a phone call they had in 2011 about her allegations\u2014a conversation Zervos says proves her accusations were not politically motivated.\n\n\u201cI realize speaking publicly about Gloria Allred could make my case against Mr. Trump more difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t sit and watch her take on more victims and not say anything.\u201d\n\nAllred called Zervos\u2019 allegations \u201cfalse,\u201d but said she was unable to comment further because of her ethical obligations to her former client.\n\n\u201cI have been a lawyer for 43 years, and my law firm and I are proud that we have always maintained the highest ethical standards and we will continue to do so for the remainder of our careers,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nAt their first press conference together, in October of 2016, Zervos sat next to Allred at a table covered in microphones, looking doe-eyed and shaken. Through tears, she told reporters that Trump had aggressively kissed her twice in 2007\u2014at one point grabbing her breast and grinding his genitals into her at what was supposed to be a business meeting. She said the experiences\u2014which Trump denies\u2014had caused her \u201ca great deal of pain and anguish.\u201d\n\nAllred painted Zervos as one of many victims who felt compelled to come forward after Trump announced his presidential bid. The now-infamous Access Hollywood tape had just been released, and Allred said Zervos decided to speak out after \u201chearing Mr Trump\u2019s words on that tape.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt or near the time of what she alleges was Mr. Trump's sexual misconduct towards her, she did share with two people close to her what she experienced with Mr. Trump,\u201d Allred said at the press conference. \u201cBut she told nobody else.\u201d\n\nBut Zervos says she had told somebody else: Allred herself. In 2011, Zervos had become anxious that the media would get wind of her story. She reached out to a friend, who approached Allred\u2019s daughter, lawyer Lisa Bloom, for legal help. Bloom then contacted Allred, who agreed to a phone call with Zervos and her friend.\n\nZervos says her friend reached out to Allred to prep her for the call. Documents reviewed by The Daily Beast show Allred, her co-worker Nathan Goldberg, and Zervos\u2019 friend exchanging several communications about \u201cpotential legal representation\u201d for \u201cS. Zervos\u201d in October 2011.\n\nWhen Zervos eventually connected with Allred on the phone, however, the call did not go well. Zervos says she pushed back when her friend described Trump as a \u201cmaniac,\u201d and told Allred she wasn\u2019t interested in filing a lawsuit. Allred, she says, scolded her for wasting her time.\n\nBut everything changed when Trump ran for president. Instead of asking her if Trump\u2019s hair was real, Zervos says people started asking whether he had ever sexually harassed her. With outlets like The New York Times covering Trump\u2019s history with women, Zervos became convinced her encounters with him would eventually come out. So she returned to the famed attorney who already knew her story.\n\nAccording to Zervos, the second meeting with Allred did not go much better than the first. She says Allred made her feel like \u201ca dime a dozen\u201d and insinuated that Trump wouldn\u2019t even remember her. And even though Zervos preferred to talk to a print news outlet, she says, Allred repeatedly pressured her to do a press conference.\n\nAllred denied pressuring Zervos into doing a press conference and said her client would have pre-approved any statement she read at the event.\n\n\u201cI have represented thousands of clients in my career and take pride in the fact that I pay individual attention to each of my clients whose cases I am handling,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cI treat each of my clients with respect and provide advice to my clients with a view to protecting them, their legal claims, and their legal rights.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Zervos says she desperately wanted Allred to reveal that they had met years earlier. She thought this information would prove she was not a political operative or fame-seeker\u2014allegations Trump and his supporters have levelled against his accusers.\n\n\u201cI think that people wonder why you took issue in the 11th hour with [Trump\u2019s behavior],\u201d Zervos told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd had it been known that I came forward in 2011, it would have shown it was something that caused me angst for a long time. It would show it was not a politically motivated situation. And it would show I was not looking to make a quick buck.\u201d\n\nBut no matter how many times she asked, she says, Allred refused to discuss their 2011 visit publicly. She says she attorney gave her a rotating list of reasons for this, at times suggesting it would make her case look worse and at others insisting the judge wouldn\u2019t like it.\n\nIn October of 2017, a year after Zervos\u2019s press conference, The New York Times revealed that Bloom, Allred\u2019s daughter, had been working with disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein to help him fend off allegations of sexual assault. The newspaper would later reveal that Allred had also brokered a number of confidential settlements with Weinstein\u2019s accusers. (Allred has since defended the practice of securing private settlements, arguing that some victims may prefer not to go through the grueling process of a civil trial.)\n\nThe revelations shocked many people who saw Allred and Bloom as crusaders for women\u2019s rights. Allred has represented women in some of the most infamous sexual assault and harassment cases, from Bill Cosby to Jeffrey Epstein, and also represents a number of other Trump accusers. When it was first revealed that her daughter had worked with Weinstein, Allred put out a pointed statement saying she only worked with victims of harassment, not the accused.\n\nAt the time, Zervos emailed Allred to express her frustration.\n\n\u201cIt is unfair that this situation makes me appear less credible while simultaneously adding fear and lack of trust to victims and future victims of powerful men,\u201d she wrote in an Oct. 7, 2017, email reviewed by The Daily Beast. \u201cI try to walk a day in other people's shoes but I do not understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not understand,\u201d Allred responded to Zervos. \u201cAre you a victim of Harvey Weinstein?\u201d\n\nFive months later, Zervos fired Allred. Both women issued brief statements, with Allred saying the split had nothing to do with the merits of Zervos\u2019 case, and Zervos saying it had nothing to do with Allred\u2019s work as her attorney. The remaining attorney on the case, Mariann Wang, thanked Allred\u2019s firm for \"all their work on this important case.\u201d\n\nBut one year later, Zervos filed a bar complaint against her former lawyer, claiming Allred had continued to discuss her case in the press. When she was a client of Allred's, Zervos wrote, the attorney had made had inaccurate statements about her case and warned her \u201chow much worse things would get\u201d if she tried to leave the firm. The attorney, she continued, was an \u201cunethical opportunist who repeatedly goes against clients\u2019 written wishes and agreements.\u201d\n\n\u201cGloria knows my case with Mr. Trump is very important to me and I am scared to rock the boat in any way,\u201d she continued. \u201cWith this she repeatedly violates me knowing I do not have an outlet.\u201d\n\nAllred says she responded to each of Zervos\u2019s allegations in writing to the state bar. In September, the organization notified her it had completed its investigation and concluded that Zervos\u2019s complaint \u201cdoes not warrant further action,\" meaning she had not violated any rules of professional conduct.\n\nAllred said she could not comment on the specific allegations without Zervos\u2019s written consent.\n\n\u201cThe allegations, even if untrue, involve communications between lawyer and client ,\u201d she said. \u201cWe responded to her complaint directly to the State Bar which made its decision to close the file because their investigation showed that there was no basis for taking any action.\u201d\n\nZervos says she plans to refile her complaint against Allred within the next three months. She is also still pursuing her defamation case against Trump, which Allred and Wang filed in 2017. In Allred\u2019s absence, Wang is now the lead attorney on the case, which asks for Trump to retract or apologize for his statements, as well as paying damages.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have attempted to have the case thrown out, claiming a sitting president cannot be sued in state court. But a New York appeals court ruled in March that the case could proceed on matters unrelated to his conduct in office.\n\nIn a statement after the appeals court decision, Wang said the court had affirmed that the president is \u201cnot above the law,\u201d adding, \u201cWe look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth.\u201d", "description": "The former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant says Allred belittled her and wouldn\u2019t disclose they discussed her allegation against Trump five years before the election.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571886491/191022-Shugerman-Summer-Zervos-Gloria-Allerd-tease_mgevnx", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
