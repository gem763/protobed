The Nationals need the same type of domination on Monday to keep their season alive. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Nationals\u2019 season is on the line Monday night, so they\u2019re turning to ace Max Scherzer.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that Manager Dave Martinez\u2019s best bullpen plan, using starters in relief, blew up in Sunday night\u2019s crushing, 10-4 loss. It doesn\u2019t matter the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 bats awoke in a scary way in Game 3. It doesn\u2019t matter that, in postseason games facing elimination, teams were 0-4 before this season when Scherzer starts. The only important thing is how the Nationals respond.\n\nThe Nationals clubhouse was quiet on Sunday after the game, but it wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary. Players sat at their lockers and scrolled through their phones. They showered, dressed and shuffled out. They repeated they didn\u2019t feel any extra pressure with their backs against the wall because, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s been that way since late May. They expressed complete confidence because they have Scherzer on the mound.\n\nThe veteran right-hander hasn\u2019t been the overwhelming force he was for much of the first half this season, but he gutted through a rocky start in the wild-card game to give his team five innings of three-run ball. The Nationals need better from him in Game 4, and they need to pounce on Rich Hill, perhaps the weakest starter they\u2019ll see this postseason.\n\nThe 39-year-old left-hander throws a fastball and a curveball and little else, and he missed three months of the season with a strained left forearm. He\u2019s made three starts since returning from the injured list and, while he\u2019s allowed one run in total, he hasn\u2019t lasted longer than three innings or thrown as many as 50 pitches.\n\nThe Nationals can bounce him from the game early and dig into a Dodgers bullpen that, as Sunday night showed with Joe Kelly in the sixth inning, is anything but lockdown itself.\n\nGame information\n\nNLDS Game 4: Los Angeles Dodgers at Washington Nationals (Dodgers lead 2-1)\n\nWhen: 6:40 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Nationals Park in Washington\n\nTV: TBS. | Stream: TBS.com\n\nStarting pitchers: Rich Hill (4-1, 2.45 ERA) vs. Max Scherzer (11-7, 2.92 ERA).\n\nLineups\n\nNationals:\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nKurt Suzuki C\n\nMichael A.
