The group organizing Saturday's march, All Under One Banner, said were hoping to get 100,000 people to attend.\n\n", "description": "Thousands in Scottish Capital March for Independence", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/07/2019100700473_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
