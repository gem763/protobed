Tensions only flared up further after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver supported Mr. Morey and his right to freedom of speech.\n\nSix Nike stores across two cities in China confirmed to Reuters they have pulled Rockets gear from their shelves. An NBA store near Shanghai also reported removing the team\u2019s merchandise.\n\nA manager of the Shanghai basketball-themed NBA Playzone, who reportedly asked to remain unnamed, confirmed they also removed Rockets merchandise from the store shelves.\n\n\u201cRockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,\u201d they said, referencing the Golden State Warriors colors.\n\nThis could mean trouble for the NBA, as their market in the world\u2019s most populated country is worth more than $4 billion and has the greatest growth potential.\n\nNike, Nike\u2019s China office and NBA China did not return Reuters\u2019 request for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
