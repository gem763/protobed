We\u2019d like to be playing a bit better in some regards at times, but hopefully we can put that performance out there on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very self-critical in terms of our performances and obviously after the Japan game we would have liked to have done things differently.\n\n\u201cBut we knew how good a team Japan were, so we always knew that would happen if we didn\u2019t play well, and it did happen.\n\n\u201cSo I think looking at the Scotland game last night, Japan were excellent again. They have been through the whole tournament.\n\n\u201cThey were clinical with the ball, every time Scotland gave them the ball they seemed to hold it for 20 or 30 phases.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty impressive, so I\u2019m sure they will go on and really worry South Africa.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s failure to launch past a World Cup quarter-final has become a millstone around the team\u2019s neck.\n\nDay 20 of #RWC2019 \u2705\n\n\n\nA spectacular end to the Pool stages with wins for Tonga, Wales and Japan \ud83d\udc4f\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s our #StoryOfTheDay \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udd8c#USAvTGA #WALvURU #JPNvSCO pic.twitter.com/whOqwdJsiM \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 13, 2019\n\nNow Kiwi boss Schmidt has the chance for another history-making achievement, should he guide Ireland past his homeland and into a maiden World Cup semi-final.\n\nIreland lost 22-10 to Wales in the 2011 quarter-finals, before Schmidt\u2019s injury-ravaged men were thumped 43-20 by Argentina in Cardiff four years ago.\n\nSexton hopes Ireland\u2019s defeat to Japan will prove their main aberration for this competition then, especially as Schmidt\u2019s side this time approach the knockout phases with a clean bill of health.\n\nIn 2015, Ireland faced Argentina without Sexton, captain Paul O\u2019Connell, back-row stalwarts Sean O\u2019Brien and Peter O\u2019Mahony \u2013 and further backline talents Jared Payne and Tommy Bowe.\n\nBundee Aki faces a disciplinary hearing on Monday night and could be ruled out for the remainder of the tournament through suspension after his red card against Samoa.\n\nBut beyond that Ireland have everyone battling for selection, leaving Sexton hopeful of yet more history this weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that having lost a pool game that we\u2019ve got that quarter-final performance out of our system that we\u2019ve had in other tournaments,\u201d said Sexton.\n\n\u201cThe way we played against Japan was probably very similar to the way we played against Wales and Argentina in the last two tournaments.\n\n\u201cThe difference now is we\u2019re not favourites going into this quarter-final whereas we were in the last two.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re building nicely, we haven\u2019t hit our best performance yet and we need to get close to that to get the right result on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt makes a big difference having everyone fit, even just for the quality of training.\n\n\u201cI remember that Argentina week. We had guys like (analyst) Vinny (Hammond) running against us, and it wasn\u2019t the best quality opposition, physically and personally!\n\n\u201cBut this week we have everyone fit, we\u2019ve two good sides for training, so we can make the most of it.\u201d", "description": "Irish fly-half says the negativity around the country\u00b4s World Cup campaign is", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/02/wire-19673792-1571018026-418_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
