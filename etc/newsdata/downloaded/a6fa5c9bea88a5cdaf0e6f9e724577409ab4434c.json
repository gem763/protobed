However, there are now three.\n\nBut Hyundai isn't the worst case. Affiliate Kia has no female executives at all among its 176 top managers.\n\nHyundai has pledged to boost the number of female executives this year, but it is hardly on the cutting edge of equal opportunities.\n\nThe glass ceiling is still a widespread reality in Korea. According to a recent report by the Economist, Korea had the severest workplace discrimination against women in the OECD.\n\nAt Samsung Electronics the situation is marginally better with female executives accounting for four percent of the top managers, although the figure is nothing to be proud of either.\n\nHyundai points out that carmaking is different to other industries and naturally attracts more talented men, but in other countries female CEOs like Mary Barra at General Motors are thriving.\n\nFemale customers are also becoming an important market for the car industry, and a company like Hyundai that is so welded to the old ways could find its fortunes sinking in this segment.", "description": "Glass Ceiling Still Rock-Solid in Korean Business", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2016/03/25/2016032501293_0.jpg", "published_at": "2016-03-25"}
