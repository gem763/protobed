Although, there was not any magical change in Indian economic scenario, but only the sentiments turned very bullish; amid hopes of upcoming changes. I find that finally the Indian equity markets realize and remained stand still amid repeated attempt to break the highest level, what they had witnessed on September 20th, 2019; in the absence of no further boosting news flow.\n\nOn the other hand, U.S. stocks fell on Friday after reports that the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, which further raised worries about escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. This step taken by the United States looks evident enough to limit U.S. investment in China, but may halt the upcoming meet on October 10th \u2013 11th , 2019.\n\nNo doubt that this step taken by the United States may spark a major sell-off in Shanghai which will not only create negative impact on trade negotiations, but also enhance the fear of global economic slowdown further, which was supposed to be cooled down with expectation of positive developments on trade deal between the two major economies of the world; which resulted in some easing in gold futures during the last week when gold futures came downward up to the levels of $1493; but once again bounced back up to the levels of $1503; which enhances the probabilities of more upward swing in gold futures to retain the levels of $1550 during the upcoming week; amid growing uncertainty at international level.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the global economy is slowing, and will continue to weigh down by unresolve tariff trade and recent tightening. Secondly, growing dilemma over a deal or no deal between the U.S. and the China will keep the global equity markets under more bearish pressure. I find that amid such scenario, Nifty 50 looks ready to take a decisive move due to shifting its focus of investors from news flow to economic fundaments.\n\nSecondly, on analysis of the movements of sectoral indices of India, I find that Nifty Media, Nifty Metal, Nifty Pharma and Nifty Realty were down more than 2%, whereas Nifty Auto, Nifty Commodity and Nifty and Nifty PSU Banks were down more than 1%; most of the other sectors were down near 0.5%. I find that the Nifty 50 may see a gap-down opening on the first trading session of the upcoming week; which will confirm the continuity of downward move further during the week.
