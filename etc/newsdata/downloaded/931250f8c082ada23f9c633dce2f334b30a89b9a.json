On Sunday he plans to make a statement of intent.\n\nOn Sunday Froome will race in an exhibition-style team time-trial for Ineos at Saitama, Japan. While on Friday, he also rode part of July\u2019s Tokyo Games road race route.\n\n\u201cThe accident has certainly changed me, given me a new start,\u201d said a determined looking Froome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like starting from zero again, below zero if you like, that\u2019s what it feels like,\u201d he said, his voice wavering slightly.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s completely changed my motivation, given me a challenge I\u2019ve never had before. This could be perceived as an incredibly difficult and negative situation, but I\u2019ve tried to turn that around to try and achieve something unprecedented.\u201d\n\nFroome will be 35 years old when the Tour embarks from Nice next June. With three other Grand Tour winners on the Ineos roster, he knows the size of the challenge ahead, not least building up the strength in his injured leg.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get the legs back to 50-50 (instead of 65-35 strength balance),\u201d says the Africa-born Briton, clearly dragging his right leg as he walks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got more surgery (in December) to remove a big metal plate and about six screws. It\u2019s quite tender, the muscle and soft tissue that\u2019s being impacted by this metal plate on my hip,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Get back where I left off\u2019 \u2013\n\nBefore the accident, Froome made no secret of his ambition to equal the five Tours de France won by Eddy Merckx, Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, but is now focussed just on starting another one.\n\n\u201cThe Tour de France is the driving force, the big prize for me is to try and get back to the Tour de France, it\u2019s still too early to say if it\u2019s doable. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to get back to where I left off,\u201d he says.\n\nFroome says the unusual 2020 Tour de France route is double motivation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Tour de France we haven\u2019t seen for decades,\u201d he says of the constantly mountainous 21-day race which has more steep climbs than usual.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much more punchy, much more explosive Tour route than usual,\u201d Froome says, analysing a route he admits he has pored over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a route that looks a lot more like a Vuelta a Espana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a typical parcours where we only see three or four \u2018GC\u2019 days, there\u2019s at least half a dozen there,\u201d he says of the demanding stages where those fighting for the general classification can make decisive moves.\n\n\u201cIt gives a lot of opportunities to the main rivals to really slug it out. That\u2019s what all fans want to see.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Mount Fuji \u2013\n\nDave Brailsford, Froome\u2019s boss and the mastermind of seven Tour de France wins, has said Ineos will pick a team which emphasises strength in depth. Froome says they will need it.\n\n\u201cCertainly there\u2019ll be strength in depth, with four Grand Tour winners on the books.\n\n\u201cBut if you look at that course on paper we\u2019ll need very versatile riders to be in that selection of eight. Guys who can do everything.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the current champion, 22-year-old Colombian Egan Bernal fits the bill, Froome smiled.\n\n\u201cEgan has handled himself very well and obviously had the Tour de France win to show for it this year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s no slouch.\u201d\n\nWhile in Japan, Froome has done a recon on the Tokyo 2020 Olympic road race, going up Mount Fuji in a car before tackling the final part of the route on a bike.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never won a one-day race,\u201d Froome said.\n\n\u201cBut the Olympic route we saw yesterday is fantastic. I can\u2019t wait to get stuck into it, to analyse it and figure out what it\u2019s going to take to win a race like that.", "description": "Saitama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Still limping heavily, Chris Froome is fighting back from less than zero, he told AFP on Saturday, in what he describes as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
