Behind every meat dress, Muppet ensemble and hair bow is a man with a plan.\n\nThis is Frederic Aspiras, the hairstylist who has been Gaga's co-pilot in creating some of her most iconic looks.\n\n\"Collaborating with Gaga is absolutely never boring,\" Aspiras told \"Good Morning America\" with a laugh. \"She always puts everyone on her toes and it's exciting every time we have to do an event or a movie or a music video.\"\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images, FILE\n\nGaga doesn't follow trends, she sets them. Which is why for New York Fashion Week, we tapped Aspiras to show us what Gaga-inspired hairstyle will be making waves on and off the runway.\n\n\"The Grammys look that we did this year is a style that a lot of women can wear,\" Aspiras said. \"It's very sexy, it embodies rock 'n' roll and it embodies effortlessness and confidence and I think it's important to show during Fashion Week that women can be strong and successful with a little bid of edge.\"\n\nFrom Gaga's secret hair care weapon to the creative collaboration process, Aspiras gave us a behind-the-scenes look at how things work in the Haus of Gaga.\n\nBefore getting to the root of hairstyling, Aspiras loves having a consultation with the artist he is working with.\n\n\"Normally what I do with Gaga is we sit and we talk about what we're going to do,\" he explained. \"Whenever we do a red carpet or we go to Fashion Week, we collaborate.\"\n\nHow to create a Gaga-esque inspired hairdo for NYFW\n\nLauren Cowart\n\nFor our demo, Aspiras tapped model Lumia Nocito and worked with Joico's line of hair care products which he often uses on Gaga. To start, he always likes to work with clean hair, so by using a volumizing shampoo and conditioner on Nictoto's locks.\n\n\"This amps your hair up,\" Aspiras explained. \"It't going to keep that fullness and that style lasting all night long.\"\n\nAspiras applies his secret weapon.\n\nLauren Cowart\n\nGaga's hair goes through a lot. Many of her iconic looks involve bleach, wigs and extensions.\n\n\"We change Gaga's hair quite often. Her real hair, her wigs, that can take a toll,\" Aspiras, who is a brand ambassador for Joico hair care products, told \"GMA.\"\n\nHer secret ingredient? Use a heat protectant.\n\n\"Having the right product can be a savior and what I love about Joico is that it helps protect hair.\"\n\nAspiras recommends adding a volumizing styler like Joico JoiFULL Volumizing Styler to your routine.\n\n\"It helps to protect your hair from heat, it helps to keep the volume and the texture. It has 24-hour style retention,\" he said.\n\nHe applies a couple of pumps from root to end on damp hair.\n\nAspiras heats things up.\n\nLauren Cowart\n\nNext, Aspiras runs the blow dryer through damp hair and brushes it out with a boar bristle paddle brush.\n\nAfter applying a few more spritzes of styler, Aspiras begins to separate hair into sections to prep for curling.\n\n\"What I was inspired by for this look was Gaga's look for the Grammys,\" Aspiras said. \"We did an edgier, rock'n'roll vibe. It's a '70s inspired look.\"\n\nAspiras is the king of the curling iron.\n\nLauren Cowart\n\nTime for the fun part ... the curling process!\n\n\"We're going to curl the hair and then pin and stack it up,\" Aspiras said.\n\nAspiras curls each section of hair away from the face and then pins it to let it cool.\n\n\"Definitely before you start curling your hair you want to use product that helps keep the curl and the retention of it,\" Aspiras said. \"Using foundation products before you start styling is key.\"\n\nUnleash the curls!\n\nLauren Cowart\n\nAspiras unpins the curls that were resting at the top of the head and blows them out with a blow dryer to break the curls up.\n\n\"I'm taking a large-tooth comb and combing through gently and kind of keeping the wave of the hair,\" he said.\n\nAspiras adds a little grit.\n\nLauren Cowart\n\nGaga's stylist likes to add a little dry shampoo to the finished look to help with the hair's texture and volume.\n\n\"A finishing product that we'll be using is the Weekend Hair,\" said Aspiras. \"It'l give you more of that texture and more of an undone finish.\"\n\nSpeaking of an \"undone finish,\" we are gaga about the final look!", "description": "We are going gaga over Frederic Aspira's definitive guide to the perfect New York Fashion Week hair.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/FredericAspiras_091019_v01_DG_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
