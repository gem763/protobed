But the video was not admissible in the case and the Italian league judge decided this week that evidence from police was not deemed sufficient to punish Cagliari.\n\nThe Italian league also didn\u2019t punish Cagliari for racist abuse aimed at Moise Kean, Blaise Matuidi and Sulley Muntari in recent seasons.\n\nThe anti-racism flyers distributed said: \u201cHelp us explain to whoever might betray our values that this can\u2019t be their stadium.\u201d\n\nIt also included a poem, \u201cWe are Sardinians,\u201d written by Nobel Prize winner Grazia Deledda: \u201cWe\u2019re Spanish, Africans, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, Pisans, Byzantines\u2026\u201d\n\nCagliari moved up to eighth place. Genoa is 12th.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Playing at home for the first time since a match marred by racist chants, Cagliari beat Genoa 3-1 in Serie A on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/italy_soccer_serie_a_63481_c0-128-3072-1919_s1770x1032.jpg?ec3ec833cbd3bfb619bcda603a6ba49c4f57d9ba", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
