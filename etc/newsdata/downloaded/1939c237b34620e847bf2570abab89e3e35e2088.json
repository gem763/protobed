Last month, it approved a law giving the government special powers to protect the Milan exchange from possible outside threat.\n\nThe BondVision trading platform is used by institutional investors, including the Bank of Italy, and mostly trades Italian government bonds, with a daily volume of 5-6 billion euros.\n\nThe sources who spoke about the possible overhaul said the plan the LSE was considering envisaged shutting down BondVision because Refinitiv has a similar bond trading platform, Tradeweb <TWO.O>.\n\nOne of the sources said that LSE was also considering moving the management functions of clearing house unit Cassa di Compensazione & Garanzia (CC&G) and settlement house Monte Titoli from Italy to London.\n\nIn London the LSE operates LCH, one of the world\u2019s biggest clearing houses.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Elvira Pollina and Giuseppe Fonte, additional reporting by Giselda Vagnoni in Rome and Huw Jones in London, editing by Silvia Aloisi, Jane Merriman and Andrew Heavens)", "description": "MILAN/ROME (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange  has given assurances to Italy that it plans to continue investing in its Italian trading platforms and does not intend to move them out of the country, a Bank of Italy source said on Thursday.
