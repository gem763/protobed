He did not live at home, I believe. She said her husband was working as a chef in a restaurant or in McDonald's.\n\n\"I saw Juli every day with her children, taking them to school or picking them up. We would talk to each other, and say hello and ask how are the girls.\n\n\"She came to my house about twice. She would come with her girls and they would play with my children. She and her children were always smiling and happy.\n\n\"Juli would stop and talk to me but Shakur never did. Whenever I saw him I would never say hello or anything. He never spoke to me.\n\n\"The last time I saw Juli's children was when they finished school for the Christmas holidays. The children seemed fine and very happy.\n\n\"The last time I saw Juli was December 28. I was outside my house washing my husband's car. We said hello to each other.\n\n\"I never saw any visitors to Juli's house.\"\n\nMs Banweyana didn't know anything was wrong until she saw Ms Begum's sister Sheli checking on her.\n\nSheli called the police after her sister didn't answer her door.\n\nThe bodies of Ms Begum and her children were then found with sheets draped over them.\n\nJurors heard Shakur had had sex with his wife one last time before suffocating her, then strangling Anika with a sock and beating Thanha to death.\n\nTwo days later, at about one o'clock on January 3, Shakur went to a travel agent to purchase a one-way ticket to Bangladesh.\n\nWitness Mohammed Choudry, who worked at KMC Travel Agency in London at the time, said: \"He said his mother was unwell so he was in a hurry.\n\n\"It wasn't unusual. We would see people, especially Bangladeshis, purchasing one-way tickets.\"\n\nThere were no flights available that evening so Shakur booked an air India flight, the cheapest one available, for 9pm the next day. He paid \u00a3340, the court heard.\n\nPolice later managed to pinpoint Shakur's phone to the vicinity of Heathrow Airport on January 4.\n\nShakur, formerly of Whitechapel, denies three counts of murder.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Mohammed Abdul Shakur, 46, is on trial over the deaths of wife Juli Begum, 26, and children Anika, five, and Thanha, six", "authors": ["Jen Tombs", "Image", "Pa", "Nicholas Razzell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14268165.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Bodies-found-in-east-London-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
