According to E! News Kutcher and his wife, Mila Kunis, aren\u2019t thrilled with the recent attention to their personal life.\n\n\u201cThe unwanted attention has been hard to deal with. They have no interest in being dragged into the spotlight or reliving the past,\u201d a source told E! News. \u201cAshton knew it was coming and he did have a heads up. But of course he would prefer not be brought into this.\u201d\n\nIn the book, Moore revealed that Kutcher asked for threesomes during their marriage and eventually cheated on Moore.\n\n\u201cDemi was always very private so it came as a surprise that she wanted to air all of her dirty laundry and have so much focus and attention on her personal life,\u201d the source added. \u201cMila and Ashton are just riding out the media attention and know it will die down soon.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with WSJ, Moore revealed that she had no intention of making anyone uncomfortable and that she hoped to speak to her ex-husbands, including Bruce Willis, before the book was published.\n\n\u201cI'd definitely like to engage with them before it comes out,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a sensitivity to anything that might make them uncomfortable. I had no interest in anybody being a bad guy.\u201d\n\nAs for Kutcher\u2019s current marriage, Kunis is reportedly not worried about this new information coming to light.\n\n\u201cMila is very supportive and understanding. It was a different time in Ashton\u2019s life and feels like a lifetime ago for all of them,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThey have moved on from all of that and have a completely different life now with their kids and family.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\u201cThe unwanted attention has been hard to deal with,\u201d a source said.", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/471iX.Ff6eOR9c.d6e4euA--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/ab8899a117a033149a4adcf61e0c63b1", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
