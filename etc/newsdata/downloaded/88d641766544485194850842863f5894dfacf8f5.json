But for some people it's hallucinations, sneezing and severe fatigue.\n\nThere are quite a few words you\u2019d associate with orgasm (pleasure, release, satisfaction) but these are some of the strangest ones that probably wouldn\u2019t cross your mind \u2013 hallucinations, sneezing and severe fatigue.\n\nThey might sound crazy, but those symptoms have actually been reported in scientific literature as unusual side effects of the normal orgasmic response \u2013 which experts refer to as something called the \u201cperi-orgasmic phenomena\u201d, according to a new review in Sexual Medicine Reviews.\n\nRead more: How to use the latest tech to have better sex and improve your relationship\n\nA typical orgasm \u2013 which the scientists define as the peak physical reaction to sexual stimulation \u2013 can include whole-body and pelvic sensations, as well as flushing, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and heavy breathing, the researchers say.\n\nPsychological effects can include feelings of happiness, love and relaxation.\n\nBut with peri-orgasm phenomena, some physiological or psychological effects occur that fall beyond those normal responses.\n\nHere, the eight strangest side effects that can be triggered by an orgasm.\n\nOrgasm side effect #1: Hallucinations\n\nIn some cases, your skills in the sack can take her to another world. Of nearly 50 women who claimed to experience an \u201cexpanded sexual response\u201d, 76 to 100% noted a flying experience or sensation of flight, according to a 2011 study from Turkey.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, up to 24% noted a sense of entering a cartoon world, up to 75% noted a feeling of leaving their bodies, and up to 24% listed d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a component, too.\n\nOrgasm side effect #2: Sickness\n\nIt\u2019s called post-orgasm illness syndrome, and it\u2019s a constellation of symptoms that have been reported in men after ejaculation, including severe fatigue, intense warmth and a temporary flu-like state.\n\nRead more: Is getting the flu vaccine worth the hype?\n\nBasically, your body mislabels proteins in your own semen as foreign invaders, which ramps up your immune response and makes you feel sick. Post-orgasm illness syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, but if you think sex is linked to your symptoms, make an appointment with an allergist, says Dr Mohit Khera, a urology professor at Baylor College of Medicine. That can help ID a semen allergy.\n\nOrgasm side effect #3: Weakness\n\nOrgasmolepsy \u2013 the sudden onset of weakness that occurs with orgasm \u2013 was first reported back in 1928, and usually occurs in connection with narcolepsy or other sleep disorders. Symptoms typically last for less than 30 seconds and include a complete loss of muscle control.\n\nPrevalence rates of orgasmolepsy differ among studies, but one of the highest-powered listed it as 22% among those with sleep disorders.\n\nResearchers aren\u2019t sure what causes it, but they believe firing of the amygdala response \u2013 coupled with hypocretin deficiency, which occurs with narcolepsy \u2013 may be to blame.\n\nOrgasm side effect #4: Crying\n\nCrying after sex is a symptom of something called postcoital dysphoria, a constellation of after-sex effects that include tearfulness, melancholy feelings, depression, anxiety or agitation. They can appear up to an hour after sex, and often occur in stable relationships, researchers say.\n\nNearly one in three female University students reported experiencing at least one symptom of postcoital dysphoria at least once, a 2011 study in the International Journal of Sexual Health.\n\nRead more: Virtual porn could give her better orgasms \u2013 and help you last longer in bed\n\nIt can be alarming to see your partner cry after sex, but it might just be a biological reflex to the hormonal and neurological that occur with it, says Dr Lori Brotto. Or, she may feel lonely after the intimacy of sex is over.\n\nOrgasm side effect #5: Sneezing\n\nCase reports linking sneezing to sex have been around since the 1900s \u2013 in fact, one from 1972 detailed a 59-year-old man who developed severe sneezing and a runny nose after orgasm, which continued for 10 years.\n\nResearchers believe that activating one part of the parasympathetic nervous system during orgasm may actually trigger a different branch of it, too, which sparks your sneezing symptoms.\n\nOrgasm side effect #6: Pain\n\nPain with orgasm can occur in women, even if pain isn't felt with intercourse. In fact, a 2009 study described three cases of women who experienced it, even without any anatomical or infectious causes of pain.\n\nRead more: This guy's powerful orgasm made him lose vision in one eye\n\nGuys aren\u2019t immune, either \u2013 men with chronic prostate disease have also been known to experience pain with orgasm, too.\n\nOrgasm side effect #7: Foot sensations\n\nAccording to a 2013 case report in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, a 55-year-old woman complained of \u201cundesired orgasmic sensations\u201d that originated in her left foot \u2013 which was the same feeling as when she was having sex with her husband.\n\nIn fact, whenever she experienced a vaginal or clitoral orgasm, she felt the same sensation in her left foot afterward. The researchers believe it may be due to partial regeneration of damaged nerve fibres in her foot.\n\nOrgasm side effect #8: Headache\n\nHeadaches caused by orgasm belong to the type 2 category of headache: Those which are bilateral, explosive and are triggered by some kind of excitement.\n\nRead more: Immune system myths you need to stop believing\n\nThe duration of orgasm headaches can range from several minutes to three hours, and may be alleviated with anti-migraine meds or pre-treatment with propranolol.\n\nArticle originally published on www.menshealth.com\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "These words you\u2019d associate with orgasm \u2013 pleasure, release, satisfaction.
