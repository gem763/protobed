These markets are coming down from a robust period, and despite the lower sales and price trends, it still wouldn\u2019t be accurate to call them soft.\u201d\n\n\n\nLuxury prices, defined by Douglas Elliman as the top 10% of the market, were hit a little harder than the rest of the market, decreasing 6.2% year on year to $2.34 million, the report said.\n\n\n\nThe price drops were to be expected since many potential third-quarter high-end sales were pushed forward to avoid the introduction of new and higher transfer tax rates on July 1, according to a separate result from brokerage Halstead.\n\n\n\nThe rush in quarter two resulted in a record-setting number of closings over $2 million, but the haste left quarter three lacking.\n\n\n\nThe new citywide property tax rules effectively raised the cost of buying a home over $2 million.\n\n\n\nThe rates changed from a general 1% tax on home sales over $1 million to a progressive tax of 1.25% on sales between $2 million and $3 million, and up to as much as 3.9% on sales of homes of $25 million or more. The tax on homes sold for between to $1 million to $2 million remained at 1%.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Swoon to Unveil Huge Installation at the IFPDA Print Fair in New York\n\nTransactions also took a hit, with closed sales down 5% to 1,447 in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, a report from Corcoran said.\n\n\n\nBut in Brooklyn, the market was impacted far less than neighboring Manhattan, according to a report from brokerage CORE.\n\n\n\nIn Manhattan during the third quarter, sales fell 14.2% compared to the same period last year, Mansion Global previously reported.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe changes to the mansion tax start at $2 million. As a result, only 19% of inventory was immediately impacted, while 7% of sales were above that same threshold,\u201d Garrett Derderian, managing director of market analysis at CORE, said in the report. \u201cLower mortgage rates supported sales and contract activity to a much greater extent than Manhattan, as fewer deals are all cash.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was a different story in neighboring Queens, where prices hit new highs in quarter three, despite seeing sales decline 7%, according to Douglas Elliman.\n\n\n\nBoth the median and average sales prices set record highs this quarter, rising 4.5% to $600,000 and 2.5% to $651,216 year over year, respectively.\n\n\n\n\u201cQueens seems to be a standout quarter after quarter since it enjoys the spillover from Brooklyn as buyers seek out greater affordability,\u201d said Steven James, president and CEO of Douglas Elliman New York City, in the report. \u201cMarket uncertainty and potential homebuyers\u2019 search for affordability are challenges facing all the markets in the New York City metro area right now, and we\u2019ll have to see how sellers adjust going forward.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-115486?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
