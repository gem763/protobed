For two decades, previous administrations have stood idly by while the number of American aluminum smelting plants dwindled from 23 down to 5. But not President Trump\u2014he decided to act. In 2018, Trump instituted a 10 percent aluminum tariff on foreign competitors, recognizing that it was the only way to ensure China\u2019s market manipulations didn\u2019t damage American businesses.\n\nClearly, the president made the right call. As a recent Reuters article emphasized, Trump\u2019s America First policy approach brought the U.S. aluminum industry back from the brink of collapse. The president\u2019s aluminum tariffs have helped to secure the jobs of some 4,000 U.S. workers, defending their factories, their industry, and, most importantly, their livelihoods.\n\nBut now, America\u2019s metalworkers face yet another major hurdle. In addition to foreign adversaries, the U.S. aluminum industry must also contend with potentially devastating domestic policy. Dissatisfied with the president\u2019s America First priorities, a group of politicians has introduced the APEX Act\u2014a bill that will not only undermine the president\u2019s agenda but will also weaken the American aluminum industry in the process.\n\nAs it currently stands, President Trump\u2019s tariffs prevent countries like China from utilizing its artificially low prices to destroy America\u2019s aluminum manufacturers. However, the APEX Act seeks to change that, undoing the progress made under the aluminum tariffs and leaving domestic producers vulnerable once again. Specifically, the bill would grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the power to set reference prices for aluminum. According to an October 23 coalition letter and the 17 freedom-minded organizations which undersigned it, including Citizen Outreach, where I serve as president, the APEX Act \u201cwould threaten domestic aluminum production, strengthen foreign manufacturers and dangerously disrupt the aluminum commodities market.\"\n\nLegislative allies of the corporate beverage lobby have seemingly crafted the APEX Act as a means to pad their bottom lines. Having previously purchased cheap aluminum from foreign sources, these beverage manufacturers have transitioned to purchasing more domestic aluminum following the implementation of Trump\u2019s tariffs. But now, these lobbying interests are attempting to return to the status quo, sacrificing American business for foreign profit. The beverage lobby has, on multiple occasions, called for intervention in aluminum prices, and the APEX Act is just the latest legislative push to get there.\n\nIf enacted, the APEX Act would effectively provide the CFTC with the singular authority to establish government controls on the price of aluminum, which would spell disaster for the industry at large. The price controls would counteract the tariffs\u2019 competitive protections, forcing U.S. metalworking companies to accept unsustainable, practically nonexistent profit margins. The American aluminum industry would once again slip into a state of decline, paving the way for foreign competitors to take their place.\n\nTowns would lose their local businesses, workers would lose their jobs, families would lose their breadwinners, and the United States would lose a piece of its national identity. All of that to save beverage manufacturers and their corporate distributors a few pennies on the dollar. This would be the legacy of the APEX Act\u2014and for that reason, it must not be adopted.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s America First policies have done this country a great service by revitalizing the U.S. aluminum industry. Now, it is incumbent upon Congress to ensure this trend continues. This isn\u2019t a partisan issue. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that aluminum must remain an essential component of the United States economy. However, the APEX Act would ensure just the opposite\u2014the aluminum industry\u2019s swift decline.\n\nAs such, American legislators need to ask themselves: Are they willing to sacrifice yet another industry to China, hanging their fellow Americans out to dry for marginally cheaper soft drinks? For our country\u2019s sake, hopefully, the answer is no.", "description": "When it comes to President Trump, even some of his .10/25/2019 19:40:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Chuck Muth", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/206/c5b24dd0-d0d3-422c-b0cb-03470d293abc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
