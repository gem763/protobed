Some of the least-free nations on the planet, from Russia to Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Egypt, Libya and 12 more.\n\nThis, evidently, is what the anti-globalist \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy the president hawked at this week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly looks like: This country standing not only among but also in front of a pantheon of human rights offenders.\n\nThe move is dispiriting but not surprising. The administration has been on a crusade to replace science-based approaches to women\u2019s health with a focus to \u201cdefend life and family.\u201d The State Department\u2019s annual human rights reports have scrapped statistics on the rates of contraceptive access and maternal mortality worldwide. (Those statistics showed, among other things, that 8 percent of such deaths result from unsafe abortion.) The administration has massively expanded the gag rule that prevents organizations from receiving federal funds if they even mention abortion to clients, and it has imposed a similar stricture on providers at home.\n\nThe United States even threatened in the spring to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution on rape amid armed conflict because it mentioned reproductive-health services for victims.\n\nAll this runs counter to a robust body of research that stresses the dangerousness of stringent abortion restrictions. The U.N. Human Rights Committee issued a comment last year clarifying that international law\u2019s right to life does include the right to an abortion for exactly that reason. States, the council said, can regulate voluntary terminations of pregnancy, but those regulations cannot jeopardize women\u2019s lives or cause them undue suffering.\n\nAbortion access isn\u2019t the only thing the Trump administration means to put under assault. The language it seeks to purge protects comprehensive services that give women control over their lives. Those services include contraceptive care, gender-based violence prevention and HIV treatment. The administration says it seeks to avoid terms that evade \u201c international consensus,\u201d but that gets it backward: The international community has agreed for decades on the need for all people to have access to a panoply of reproductive services, and now the United States has banded with the notoriously oppressive to attempt a retroactive hecklers\u2019 veto.\n\nThose who still believe in the liberal world order can take cold comfort in the likelihood that the rogue\u2019s gallery won\u2019t win on this one; 58 countries signed on to a counter-statement helmed by the Netherlands in favor of the status quo. But the episode has shown what\u2019s in store for this nation and the world under Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist paradigm. Putting America first means putting it shoulder to shoulder with serial repressors. It also means putting women last.", "description": "In pushing to strike U.N. language on sexual and reproductive health, the U.S. aligns itself with Russia, Saudi Arabia and other oppressive regimes.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4MioVdGSuNL5nskz8A9M67Y8BSQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DR4DKPXAY4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
