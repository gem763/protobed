Sporting edgy black packaging (against a sea of traditional white packaging down the diaper aisle), the diapers are made from plant-based materials and are said to be absurdly soft (per the parental reviews out there). It\u2019s the most ideal diaper for picky millennial parents: cool-looking box, soft fit, and an Earth-saving story.\n\nAll from a company that is approaching 150 years old.\n\n\u201cSomebody told me to call it Beyond Diapers,\u201d joked Kimberly-Clark CEO Michael Hsu in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Of course Hsu was referencing the wildly popular plant-based food maker Beyond Meat (BYND).\n\nImportantly for Kimberly-Clark, the new diapers are selling like hotcakes and are priced at a premium to most other Huggies and rival offerings.\n\nFeatured in a stylish black box with the iconic Huggies logo, Huggies\u00c2\u00ae Special Delivery\u00e2\u00a2 diapers are now available online in sizes Newborn through Size 6, and at major U.S. retailers at the end of July, and Canadian retailers in August. More\n\nFor Hsu, a long-time consumer products executive who took over in January after a six-year stint rising up the ranks at Kimberly-Clark, the diapers are part of his early efforts to make the company\u2019s products more relevant to shoppers. By building in added bells and whistles into Huggies, Depends undergarments (think more flexible materials) and Cottonelle toilet paper (yes, toilet paper can always be softer) Hsu believes Kimberly-Clark could command higher price points in some ultra competitive product categories.\n\n\u201cAfter a previous few years of slower growth, we are really trying to re-accelerate our growth. We have had some challenging market positions,\u201d Hsu concedes.\n\nSo far, so good\n\nKimberly-Clark\u2019s second quarter earnings took most on Wall Street by surprise, giving Hsu an early win and bolstering confidence that his strategy is the right one.\n\nSecond quarter earnings of $1.67 beat analyst forecasts by 3 cents. Organic sales rose 5%, no small feat for Kimberly-Clark. Wall Street was impressed by 8% organic sales growth in the personal care business, along with an improvement in diaper sales in China.\n\nHsu lifted the company\u2019s full-year organic sales and operating income guidance, too.\n\nKimberly-Clark\u2019s stock is hovering around a 52-week high.\n\nNow, Hsu and his team just have to prove to Wall Street the second quarter wasn\u2019t a fluke. And that investments in improving product quality won\u2019t chip away too much at the bottom line.\n\n\u201cWe see near-term stock upside in Kimberly-Clark with conservative fiscal year guidance, but still harbor longer term concerns about the sustainability of strong recent top line results,\u201d wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian in a note to clients.\n\nSaid Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English, \u201cWe remain Neutral rated on the stock as we try to balance the potential of sustained top-line momentum with a lower flow through to profitability and earnings per share.\u201d\n\nKey to impressing investors\n\nHsu does have a secret weapon besides softer Huggies to please investors. That is a massive cost-savings plan. Kimberly-Clark recently took the cover off a new $500 million to $550 million cost savings program that will end by 2021. The company is 18 months into the operational fine-tuning \u2014 it has realized 40% of the savings so far.\n\n\u201cWe are executing the largest restructuring in our history right now, it\u2019s structurally lowering our cost base,\u201d Hsu proclaims.\n\nBlack packaging for Huggies diapers though... who would have thought?\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark is beginning to enjoy a nice revival.
