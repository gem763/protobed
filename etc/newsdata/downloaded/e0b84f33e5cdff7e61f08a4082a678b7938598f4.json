(Allison Joyce/Getty Images)\n\nBangladesh took in 750,000 Rohingya expelled from Myanmar in a military-led crackdown. Two years on, facing simmering conflict between natives and the recent arrivals, and after failed attempts to persuade some refugees to return, the host country is running out of patience for the Rohingya.\n\nAuthorities have blamed Rohingya militants for the killing of a ruling-party politician last month and accused refugees of smuggling drugs from Myanmar \u2014 a trade that activists say entices some for want of opportunities in the camps. Several Rohingya are reported to have been killed in recent shootouts with police.\n\nLimits on Internet and cellphone service imposed this month, along with curbs on aid agencies, offer some of the clearest signs that Bangladesh is growing tired of the camps in its impoverished southeast and is looking for ways to nudge the Rohingya back to Myanmar without resorting to force. The mostly Muslim refugees have resisted two attempts to repatriate a handful of them to Myanmar, a Buddhist-majority nation that denies them many rights and whose army violently ejected them in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s actions are an easy solution to a bigger problem,\u201d said Imtiaz Ahmed, director of the Center for Genocide Studies at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh, in relation to the communication restrictions and challenges of security and repatriation.\n\n[A year after the assault on the Rohingya, Myanmar\u2019s generals are unapologetic]\n\nOn Monday, Bangladesh\u2019s telecom regulator ordered network operators to halt all cellphone service in an area covering the Rohingya camps near Cox\u2019s Bazar, near the Myanmar border. The move followed a limited shutdown on cellphone service, between 5 p.m. and 5 a.m., imposed on Sept. 1.\n\nIt mirrored Myanmar\u2019s decision in June to block mobile Internet services in its western regions that were formerly home to many Rohingya.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s deputy director, Nahidul Hasan, cited state security and law and order as justification for the clampdown. Bangladesh had previously banned sales of SIM cards in the camps, but they were widely available and locals often sold them to refugees. The government says official identification, which Rohingya lack, is needed to buy a SIM card.\n\nOn a recent day here at the tail end of monsoon season, refugees congregating inside their homes and under storefront awnings voiced fears about the growing pressure.\n\n\n\nChildren watch a video on a mobile phone in a Rohingya refugee camp in Cox's Bazar.

How can you restrict Internet and confiscate mobile phones?\u201d said Abu Murshed Chowdhury, co-chairman of Cox\u2019s Bazar CSO-NGO forum, a network of nonprofit and human rights groups.\n\n[The \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019 of the Rohingya]\n\nBrad Adams, Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia director, said in a statement that Bangladesh faced a challenge in dealing with the refu\u00adgee crisis but had \u201cmade matters worse by imposing restrictions on refugee communications and freedom of movement.\u201d\n\nActivists say Bangladesh officials are penalizing the Rohingya after some refugees held a rally Aug. 25 to commemorate the two-year anniversary of their expulsion and to call on Myanmar to grant them a proper path to repatriation through citizenship. Since 1982, Rohingya have been unable to legally marry, gain access to education and many jobs, or move freely within Myanmar.\n\n\u201cThe protest was not meant to cause Bangladesh harm in any way,\u201d Khatun said. \u201cWe are grateful to this country for giving us space, but we want to know about our future.\u201d\n\n\n\nRohingya refugees watch a film on a phone in Cox's Bazar.

The head of the Office of Refugee Relief and Repatriation and the official in charge of the camp where the rally occurred were transferred out of their roles.\n\nBangladesh also banned two aid groups, including the U.S.-based Adventist Development and Relief Agency, from operating in the camps. Mohammad Ashraful Afsar, an official in Cox\u2019s Bazar district, told the Dhaka Tribune that the organization had been encouraging Rohingya to resist attempts to repatriate them and that it had financed the protest, including by giving them clothes.\n\n[Pulitzer Prize-winning Reuters reporters freed from prison in Myanmar]\n\nThe U.S. agency denies this. \u201cFor visibility, donors gave T-shirts to refugees in some of the camps. It wasn\u2019t meant for the rally, it was meant for ongoing activities,\u201d said Iqbal Hassan, a field monitoring officer. \u201cWe have had no role in repatriation efforts or even a role in counseling Rohingya for or against repatriation.\u201d\n\nHassan said his organization employed almost 5,000 Rohingya laborers who helped to build pathways and bridges and repair monsoon damage. \u201cThey will lose their livelihood now,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed concerns about the role of NGOs, suggesting they were fomenting opposition to efforts to return refugees to Myanmar.\n\n\u201cActually, these agencies never want them to go back,\u201d Hasina told a news conference in June. She also questioned Myanmar\u2019s commitment to providing a safe space that would allow the Rohingya to go home. Myanmar says it is doing all it can but has not agreed to grant Rohingya full citizenship rights.\n\nWith frustration building, and a solution as elusive as ever, the situation in the camps is increasingly tense. Refugees fear they will remain in limbo.\n\n\u201cWill we only survive this life by taking rice and lentils from aid groups?\u201d asked Nurul Alam, a shopkeeper who fled Myanmar in 2017.\n\n\n\nA man walks through a refu\u00adgee camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar during a downpour last month.
