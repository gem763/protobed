Majorities of Americans say they've lost trust in the federal government and each other \u2014 and think that lack of trust gets in the way of solving problems, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThat's the worst part of all, as Axios' Felix Salmon points out: Even a small amount of misinformation infects everything and makes it much easier for people to disbelieve any fact.\n\nThe backstory: This didn't happen overnight, and has more than one root cause:\n\nThe rise of partisan TV news in the U.S., led by Fox and now widespread throughout cable news, broke the homogenizing and unifying hold of the old TV networks.\n\nThe internet sped things up and broke them down. It gave everyone a megaphone, allowing wider participation in political dialogue but also accelerating the spread of unvetted information and amplifying the most raucous and extreme voices.\n\nThis is the fertile ground on which bad actors today are merrily scattering the seeds of doctored videos, bogus memes, political slurs and other species of misinformation.\n\nAs Axios' Sara Fischer and Kaveh Waddell reported last month, misinformation tactics in the 2020 election are getting more sophisticated. New twists include smarter bots, pages and accounts that build a following before spreading deception, and a shift from mass platforms to more obscure and less monitored venues.\n\nBut it's not just the election. Today, misinformation is coming at us from all directions:\n\nIt's used against our government by international criminals.\n\nIt's also used by our government, with a president whose Twitter feed needs a fact check for practically every tweet.\n\nIt's used against businesses, by competitors and short-sellers who hope to profit from rumor.\n\nIt's also used by businesses on topics like climate science or tobacco research when the facts might harm their bottom lines.\n\nIt's used against social media platforms by partisans on the right making unsubstantiated charges of bias.\n\nIt's used against scientists when their findings, in areas like gun violence, reproductive health or (again) global warming, clash with deeply held partisan positions.\n\nAnd it becomes a public health threat every time misinformation warriors clustered on both left and right spread doubt, yet again, about vaccines.\n\nMore than anywhere else, it's a huge problem for the news media, where public trust is at historic lows.\n\nBetween the lines: Our misinformation apocalypse has many contributors across the political spectrum, but one group benefits: authoritarians. They flourish when citizens overwhelmed with bad information give up on trying to figure out the truth.\n\nThe bottom line: We won't be able to solve our problems if we can't even agree which ones are real.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nMisinformation haunts 2020 primaries\n\nNew fake-news worry for Instagram\n\nThe coming deepfakes threat to businesses\n\nThe 2020 campaigns aren't ready for deepfakes", "description": "It's undermining trust in politics and government, but also business, technology, science and health care.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/a2AWJ8NC-JrD4jHyGLXvKDkcexY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/11/1568232007964.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
