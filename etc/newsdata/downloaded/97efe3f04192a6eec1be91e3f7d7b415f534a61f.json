REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting ready for a strike because we want GM to treat people fairly,\u201d said Elzy, 64, waving a sign saying \u201cUAW On Strike\u201d outside the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s engine plant in Flint, Michigan, on Monday. \u201cGM knew this was coming and they\u2019ve been stashing new trucks all over the county so they can keep selling while we\u2019re on strike.\u201d\n\nAt midnight around 48,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) headed for the picket lines after labor contract talks reached an impasse over healthcare benefits, wages, profit-sharing and the use of temporary workers on Sunday.\n\nThe union and GM restarted bargaining on Monday.\n\nGM has relatively high inventories of its high-margin vehicles, but the strike is expected to shut down all of its North American facilities quickly and could hurt the U.S. economy.\n\nMost of GM\u2019s profits come from the U.S. market.\n\nLike many others on the picket line in Flint or outside the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant Monday morning, Chaz Akers, 32, of Ferndale, Michigan, said he wants he wants temporary workers to be hired full-time.\n\n\u201cI work right across from a temporary employee who\u2019s been there for two and a half years,\u201d said Akers, who has worked at GM 3-1/2 years. \u201cI install the passenger side headlight. He installs the driver side headlight. I make more money than he does. I have better health insurance than he does. It ain\u2019t fair. It ain\u2019t right. If you\u2019re going to pay people to do a job, pay them all the same.\u201d\n\nAkers and other workers outside the Detroit plant, which does not have product allocated beyond the end of the year, said getting another product for the plant is not enough if GM does not address the disparities in worker pay.\n\nU.S. automakers use temporary employees, who are paid less and receive fewer benefits, to be more cost-competitive versus their Asian and European counterparts with non-unionized plants in the U.S. South.\n\nThe mood on the picket lines in Flint and Detroit at the start of the widely anticipated strike was good-humored and morale among picketers was high. Most drivers passing by honked their horns to cheers from strikers under a gray, cool fall sky. Outside the Detroit plant, a large red city fire engine did the same and turned on its emergency lights.\n\n\u201cWe stood up to help GM through bankruptcy, we made concessions and we\u2019ve built good product for them,\u201d said Marty Chovanec, 61, who was hired at GM\u2019s Flint truck plant at the age of 19.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been patient and we haven\u2019t had a raise in 12 years,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that GM is making record profits, we deserve a cut and a fair share.\u201d\n\nHarrison Bowyer, 50, showed up to show his support and to picket in Flint even though he is not scheduled to be on duty until Friday.\n\n\u201cGM works the crap out of temp workers and then throws them away, so I\u2019m fighting for jobs for future generations\u201d he said. \u201cNo one walks out on a paycheck for no reason, but as much as it\u2019s going to hurt us, if the strike lasts a while, it will hurt GM more.\u201d\n\nThe last time the UAW struck against GM, in 2007, the strike was over in two days. A more painful strike occurred in Flint in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the automaker more than $2 billion.\n\nWhile workers on the picket lines said they hope the strike is over quickly, they said they have been socking away cash to help make ends meet. Union strike pay for workers is $250 per week, a fraction of their normal wage.\n\nOutside the Detroit plant, Dawn Bryant, 39, of Detroit, whose husband works at a GM plant in Romulus, said she took a temporary job on the assembly line about six months ago because she felt it would lead to a full-time position.\n\n\u201cIf this goes on for weeks, how will we survive?\u201d she said. \u201cNo one could live off $250 a week. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nBryant added, however, that it is a struggle earning about $10 an hour after taxes and health care premiums, and said GM should give her a path to full-time employment.\n\nOutside GM\u2019s Flint engine plant, Eric Cooley, 44, said everyone loses in a strike.\n\n\u201cBut when the company is making billions and billions of dollars, it\u2019s only fair to give us a little more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call the American way.\u201d", "description": "Willie Elzy has been readying for a possible strike against General Motors Co for months and, pointing to a parking lot full of freshly built pickup trucks, he says it's clear the automaker has been preparing too.", "authors": ["Nick Carey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430509940&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F16A", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
