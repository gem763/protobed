As I watch and read about the ongoing impeachment proceedings against President Trump, I get more and more heartsick about the way Congress is behaving.\n\nFor something as serious as removing a president from office, I would expect Congress to conduct a thorough investigation, seeking out information from all sources. The proceedings should not include a pre-determined assumption of guilt, as we see today. This is, sadly, similar to the Kavanaugh hearings, in which a candidate was assumed guilty before and during the hearing. The Democratic Party is hell-bent on a guilty charge with no evidence. That is not the America I grew up in, nor is it what I want.\n\nWe have 535 members in Congress, yet thus far just a very small percentage of that body (Adam Schiff and company) are driving all that we hear \u2014 or don\u2019t hear. Any president should be treated with respect and everything should be done to provide an open discussion. I\u2019m not seeing that, and I am saddened that we have a nation that seems to be accepting the tragedy unfolding before our eyes.\n\nWe must remember: Congress works for us.\n\nTOM TYSCHPER\n\nGilbert, Ariz.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
