Add Interest\n\nEarly media reports about the whistleblower complaint, which was filed in August, said that president Trump may have urged the president of Ukraine, Voldymyr Zelensky, to launch an investigation into Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, during a July phone conversation.\n\nTrump has since acknowledged discussing Biden on the call, but denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMuch is still unclear about what led to the whistleblower report and there's much that's still unknown, but here's some context and a timeline of important developments that occurred around the complaint and in its aftermath:\n\nJune 13, 2019: Trump tells ABC News' Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos that he would consider accepting damaging information about a political rival from a foreign country without alerting the FBI first\n\nAsked by ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos, in an Oval Office interview, whether his campaign would accept damaging information on opponents from foreigners -- such as China or Russia -- or hand it over to the FBI, Trump said, \"I think maybe you do both.\"\n\n\"I think you might want to listen, there isn't anything wrong with listening,\" Trump continued. \"If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] 'we have information on your opponent' -- oh, I think I'd want to hear it.\"\n\nJune 18, 2019: The Department of Defense announces $250 million in aid for Ukraine\n\nIn a press release, the Department of Defense announced plans to provide equipment to support military operations in Ukraine.

At some point, the aid is put on hold.\n\nJuly 24, 2019: Former special counsel Robert Mueller testifies on Capitol Hill\n\nMueller testified before two House committees about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nJuly 25, 2019: Trump partakes in the now controversial phone call with the new president of the Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nTrump took part in what he has referred to as a \"routine\" phone call with the newly elected Ukranian leader. The substance of what he said in this phone call reportedly prompted the whistleblower complaint.\n\nJuly 28, 2019: Trump announces that Dan Coats will be leaving his role as director of national intelligence\n\nThree days after the call with Ukraine, Trump tweets that Coats, who had been serving as the director of national intelligence since March 2017, would be stepping down.

John Ratcliffe to fill the role.\n\nAug. 8, 2019: Trump changes course on DNI nomination, Coats' top deputy resigns\n\nAfter a failed attempt to rally support for Ratcliffe, Trump announces that he will instead name Joseph Maguire to fill in for Coats. Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle -- as well as some members of the intelligence community -- had hoped that Trump would name Sue Gordon, Coats' second in command, to fill the role, but Trump announced in a tweet on Aug. 8 that Gordon would also be departing.\n\nAug. 12, 2019: The whistleblower files a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general\n\nAn unidentified member of the intelligence community filed a complaint with Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community. In the complaint, the whistleblower outlined several instances of concern related to the president's communications with a foreign leader. \u200bThe complaint has not been made publicly available, but the inspector general revealed the nature of the complaint in a letter, and sources have told ABC News other details of the complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower's filing would not be reported publicly for almost a month.\n\nAug. 16, 2019: Joseph Maguire assumes role of acting director of national intelligence\n\nJ.

In the meantime, the U.S. does not disperse aid to Ukraine.\n\nSept. 2, 2019: Deadline passes for Maguire to alert Congress to the whistleblower report\n\nUpon receipt of a report from the inspector general, the law gives the director of national intelligence one week to determine whether the concern rises to the level of requiring a report to the House and Senate Intelligence committees. Maguire does not alert Congress to the whistleblower report by this deadline.\n\nSept. 9, 2019: Atkinson expresses his concerns to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and ranking member Devin Nunes in a letter\n\nAfter Maguire did not disclose the information to Congress, Atkinson did.

He also said he believed there were efforts to keep details of the report out of the hands of Congress.\n\n\"I believe that there is an effort to prevent this information getting to Congress, and if the assertion is accurate that the Department of Justice has made and the DNI has affirmed, that this involves a potentially privileged communication, then at one level or another, likely involves either president or people around him,\" he said.\n\nSept. 20, 2019: Trump tries to redirect focus to Biden\n\nTrump tells a group of reporters that his communications with foreign officials are \"always appropriate.\" He also pointed questions back to Biden.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what I discussed, but I'll tell you this, somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement,\" Trump said.\n\nSept. 20, 2019: The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump urged Zelensky to work on an investigation into Biden's son eight different times.\n\nThe report suggests that during his phone call with Zelensky, Trump urged the Ukraine president to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on a probe into Biden's son.\n\nSept. 21, 2019: Ukraine foreign minister says that Trump did not put pressure on Zelensky during the July call\n\nUkraine foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko told a Ukrainian media outlet that Trump did not put pressure on the Ukraine president during the phone call.\n\n\"I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,\" Prystaiko said. \"This conversation was long, friendly and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\"\n\nSept. 22, 2019: Trump acknowledges discussing Biden with Ukraine's president\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nTrump defended his July 25 phone call with Zelenksy while speaking with reporters before departing for a trip.\n\n\"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\" Trump said.\n\nSept. 22, 2019: Schiff suggests that the contents of the report could move the needle closer to impeachment.\n\nSchiff appeared on CNN saying impeachment might be the \"only remedy\" if reports of Trump withholding military aid were true.\n\n\"This seems different in kind and we may very well have crossed the Rubicon here,\" Schiff said.\n\nSept. 22, 2019: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi releases a letter calling for the administration to allow Congress access to the whistleblower complaint\n\nIn her letter, Pelosi wrote that the blocking of the complaint marked a \"grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\"", "description": "A timeline of events surrounding the whistleblower report on President Donald Trump's phone call with the Ukraine President.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-6-rt-er-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
