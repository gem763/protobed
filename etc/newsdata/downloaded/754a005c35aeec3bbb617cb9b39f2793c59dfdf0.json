The 2019 version of Nancy Drew is an 18-year-old former beauty queen whose Ivy League plans and sleuthing hobby are put on hold after the sudden death of her mother. \u201cI don\u2019t go searching in the dark anymore,\u201d Nancy, played by newcomer Kennedy McMann, says ominously. \u201cNot after the darkness found me.\u201d In addition to a heaping dose of adolescent trauma, our heroine has a deadpan voice and a penchant for sardonic wit. She also has sex. Lots of it.\n\nShortly into the show\u2019s pilot, viewers are treated to a teen drama trademark\u2014a fully clothed, under-the-covers sex scene between Nancy and Ned \u201cNick\u201d Nickerson (Tunji Kasim), who has been recast as a casual hookup with a criminal record rather than a doting boyfriend. There are quite a few of these steamy-lite montages in the first two episodes of Nancy Drew.\n\nThis should come as no surprise given that it was created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, the duo behind The O.C. and Gossip Girl, and practically the inventors of the attractive-twenty-somethings-playing-sexed-up-teens formula for a hit TV show. Schwartz and Savage are essentially the patron saints of bingeable, guilty pleasure melodrama. Unfortunately, their latest attempt fails to match the charm of their earlier work, though McMann, who has never starred in a major television show or movie before, is a formidable anchor for the series.\n\nNancy Drew is set in the fictional New England town of Horseshoe Bay, Maine, which one character, a wealthy out-of-towner, describes as like the town in Jaws, \u201cbut with no shark. At least the shark made things exciting.\u201d But beyond the idyllic red-white-and-blue color palette and picturesque pine-tree-lined bluffs, Horseshoe Bay is plagued by dark secrets surrounding the mysterious death of a local girl. Lucy Sable, like Nancy, was crowned winner of the Sea Queen beauty pageant in 2000, just before she disappeared, leaving behind only a tiara and a shred of a pink dress.\n\nSome of Horseshoe Bay\u2019s more superstitious residents believe that the ghost of Lucy haunts the vacation town. Indeed, Nancy appears to be tormented by (surprisingly) frightening visions of the dead beauty queen, often signaled by an eerie chorus of children\u2019s voices chanting a refrain that will inevitably be stuck in my head for days to come: \u201cLucy Sable once was able to look upon the sea. But someone got her in the water and that\u2019s where she\u2019ll always be. Count to five, enjoy the view, hope the killer doesn\u2019t get to you.\u201d All of this effective spookiness is promptly undermined, however, by the fact that the townspeople couldn\u2019t come up with a more creative name for their ghost than \u201cDead Lucy,\u201d which is repeated frequently and with grave seriousness.\n\nWith her college aspirations derailed and the debt remaining from her mother\u2019s medical bills, Nancy is working at a seafood restaurant when she finds herself an unlikely suspect in the murder of a socialite. Eager to clear her name and unable to resist the pull of her one-time passion for detective work, she sets out to solve the mystery herself. Through Veronica Mars-esque voiceover narration, viewers access Nancy\u2019s innermost thoughts as she pieces together clues and begins to suspect all of those around her. Other suspects include Nick, and her three coworkers\u2014high school nemesis George Fan (Leah Lewis), ditzy rich girl Bess Marvin (Maddison Jaizani), and burnout dishwasher Ace (Alex Saxon). Her father, played by Scott Wolf, is her lawyer, though their relationship is strained by the loss of Nancy\u2019s mother.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to watch Nancy Drew without drawing comparisons to Riverdale, only strengthened by the fact that it airs directly after the popular high school soap about characters from the Archie comics. Both shows are adapted from source material that was popular in the 1940s and \u201950s. Both reimagine beloved, squeaky-clean teen protagonists as modern-day teenagers who have sex, talk back to their parents, and, oh, regularly commit felonies. They have in common a pulpy, neo-noir tone and possibly supernatural elements. The dialogue in Nancy Drew is similarly cheesy, and, at times, forced and unnatural for the sake of explaining unnecessarily complicated plot developments.\n\nMost crucially, though, the two CW shows share the irritatingly effective habit of ending each episode with a montage set to a top-100 pop song and packed with no less than ten cliffhangers, ensuring that, despite my better judgment, I have no choice but to tune in every week.\n\nNancy Drew premieres on Oct. 9 at 9:00 p.m. ET on The CW.", "description": "The 2019 version of the iconic teen girl detective feels like a cross between \u201cRiverdale\u201d and \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d\u2014from the minds behind \u201cThe O.C.\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl.\u201d Strap in.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_674,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570595764/191009-julian-nancy-drew-hero_ojdlwg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
