It provided us the impetuous to do it faster and realise the strategy quicker than what we originally planned,\" he said.\n\nSee also: Amazon Web Services: A cheat sheet (TechRepublic)\n\nAs part of the strategy, corporate, student, and researcher workloads are being migrated. Molinia said the project is well underway and has been for the last 12 months. He noted how while there is still a year left until completion, the university is already reaping the benefits.\n\n\"[Moving to the cloud] showcases our ability to pivot and deliver that organisational and transformation change,\" he said.\n\n\"From a staffing perspective, it's given a new lease of life as it's adding more personal value to their capability and skill set.\n\n\"In addition, it means we have a clear focus on what applications we have, when they need to run, and that's what the consumption-based models forces us to focus on really running IT as business.\n\n\"Previously, you buy a server, install a computer and the app is built, and you don't water or treat it as much as you should. This puts it in line of sight because you need to make sure you're on top of the application and things remain current.\"\n\nHe touted how the university's decision to not build a new data centre will also have positive impacts on the environment.\n\n\"University of Newcastle wants to be known for its environmental sustainability position. One of the key factors is we're exiting a data centre. Part of that process is do you build another data centre or do you try something different, and that environmental sustainability value is featured in that decision making process,\" Molinia said.\n\nOnce the migration is completed, Molinia said the university would look to introduce new technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, voice recognition, and facial recognition.\n\n\"It's going to help researchers deliver on their research outcomes much faster and also improve our ability to use data as an asset. There are huge amounts of opportunities not just from an emerging tech perspective, but also our ability to run the business more effectively,\" he said.\n\nRelated coverage", "description": "The university will exit from its on-premise datacentre.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/05/43803e37-124e-46fa-8a13-9e4c9e92f953/thumbnail/770x578/eb2438a90a3f33d3231e6df481a38fba/istock-university-students.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
