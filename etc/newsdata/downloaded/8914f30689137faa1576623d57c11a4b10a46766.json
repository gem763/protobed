People within the free software community had whispered to one another for years, but the emails reignited debate about his position within the community.\n\nSelam Jie Gano, the MIT alumna who first published excerpts from Stallman\u2019s emails, told The Daily Beast of Stallman\u2019s resignation: \u201cIt was going to happen eventually. It was obvious that he wasn\u2019t following our community values and guidelines. I hope this motivates a larger conversation.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Friday that Stallman had also advocated for the legalization of child pornography and the abolishment of age of consent laws for more than 15 years on his personal site, stallman.org, the same blog he used to announce his resignation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery", "Thedailybeast.Com Richard-Stallman-Famed-Mit-Computer-Scientist-Who-Defended-Jeffrey-Epstein-Resigns Source Articles Via Rss"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
