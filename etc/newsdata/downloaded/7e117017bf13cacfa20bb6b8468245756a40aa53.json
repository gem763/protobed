Woof mates, it\u2019s smooth as syrup.\n\nTaking to the Triple J studios while in town for the annual Listen Out Festival, the Brooklyn rapper switched lanes from her typical bass-heavy beats to lay down a silky smooth lounge version of Blackstreet\u2018s massive hit, \u2018No Diggity\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019d probably know Leikeli47 from her track \u2018Money\u2019, which is a god damn mood and an earworm of a banger, and she gathered in a full horn section, percussion, and backup singers to groove through the slick rendition of the 1996 R&B hit.\n\nREAD MORE Flume And Friends Lead The Absolutely Enormous Listen Out 2019 Lineup\n\nLet this be another addition to my personal pitch for Biggest \u2018Like A Version\u2019 Compilation CD Ever, because I simply cannot stop listening to it. Plus the contrast between the audio and the visual of Leikeli47 in her full-face balaclava (with extra access to put her hoops in her lobes) is just so so good.\n\nCheck out the performance below, and if you wanna see Leikeli47 in full flight, she smashed through her own track \u2018Tic Boom\u2018 as well.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to cop Leikeli47 live at Listen Out Fest in Sydney tomorrow, Oct 5, at Centennial Park.", "description": "Brooklyn rapper Leikeli47 swung into the Triple J studios to lay down a damn smooth renditon of Blackstreet's 'No Diggity' for Like A Version.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/leikeli47-lav-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
