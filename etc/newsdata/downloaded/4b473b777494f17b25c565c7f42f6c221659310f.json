We benchmark against UK national data, published by the Health and Safety Executive, confirming we have over 40 per cent fewer injuries, on average, than other transportation and warehousing businesses in the UK.\n\n'At UK fulfilment centres, ambulance calls occurred at a rate of 0.000003 per worked hour, which is dramatically low.'\n\nAmazon denies claims of workers' stress in its warehouses, saying they're not convinced the 'staff polled' actually worked for them.\n\nFrom January 2016 to August 2019 there were 159 cases of chest paint, 85 of staff being found unconscious, 51 of breathing problems, 38 for trauma, 20 for falls and two electric shocks at seven warehouses\n\nA spokesperson for the company said: 'We haven't been provided with confirmation the people who completed the survey worked at Amazon.\n\n'We don't recognise these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings.\n\n'We have a focus on ensuring we provide a great environment for all our employees and last month Amazon was named by LinkedIn as the 7th most sought after place to work in the UK and ranked first place in the US.\n\n'Amazon also offers public tours of its fulfillment centres so customers can see first-hand what happens after they click 'buy' on Amazon.\n\n'Amazon ensures all of its associates have easy access to toilet facilities which are just a short walk from where they are working.'", "description": "Amazon's 11 UK warehouses, or 'fulfillment centres', have been attended by ambulances 606 times.
