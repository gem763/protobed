REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe Los Angeles event was the second major presidential forum dedicated to LGBTQ issues during the Democratic nominating campaign, following an event in Iowa last month that drew 10 of the 19 candidates vying to take on U.S. President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nBiden, the front-runner in the Democratic race, struggled during the previous forum to articulate his positions, particularly his vote as a U.S. senator for a military funding bill that included the \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, which banned harassment of closeted gay soldiers but barred those who were out from military service..\n\nBiden later backed repeal of that policy and while he voted for a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman, he backed same-sex marriage before President Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president.\n\nOn Thursday night, he defended his record and assailed efforts to curb LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cI would curtail foreign assistance to countries who engage in this kind of behavior,\u201d said Biden, adding he would establish an office in the State Department with the job of promoting LGBTQ rights around the world.\n\nBiden was followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who if elected would be the first openly gay U.S. president.\n\nButtigieg was able to speak in the first person about his experience as a gay man. He recounted serving in Afghanistan in the military while he was still closeted and realizing he might die without being able to know what it was like to fall in love and marry.\n\nOn the subject of public health rules that bar gay men from giving blood dating from the HIV epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, Buttigieg\u2019s personal experience colored his answer.\n\n\u201cMy blood is not welcome in this country and it\u2019s not based on science,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cIt\u2019s based on prejudice.\u201d\n\nAs president, he said, he would move to change the policy.\n\nCRITICISM OF TRUMP RECORD\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker opened the forum, stressing inclusion and acceptance.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lead the people if you can\u2019t love the people \u2013 all the people,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a top Democratic contender, missed the event while he recovers from a heart attack.\n\nGay rights advocates have expressed dismay at the Trump administration\u2019s record on LGBTQ issues, including a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.\n\nLawyers for the Department of Justice argued at the U.S. Supreme Court this week that federal civil rights law does not prohibit employers from firing workers based on their transgender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nAhead of the forum, Buttigieg and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris released plans to secure equality for LGBTQ people.\n\nAll three support the Equality Act, like most other Democrats, which would explicitly add LGBTQ protections to federal anti-discrimination law.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThey also vowed to make pre-exposure prophylaxis, a drug that helps lower the risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus, accessible and affordable to all who want it.\n\nButtigieg said he would eliminate the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, in part by restoring the White House Office of National AIDS Policy that has gone dormant under Trump.\n\nAll three candidates promised to elevate LGBTQ concerns as president. Warren said she would appoint a special envoy at the State Department, while Harris said she would create a White House position, chief advocate for LGBTQ+ Affairs, to coordinate efforts across the entire federal government.", "description": "Joe Biden said on Thursday he would withhold foreign aid from countries that persecute lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, as he joined eight other Democratic presidential candidates at a televised forum on LGBTQ issues.", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439501388&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A033", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
