They led to the game being halted twice in the first half after fans made monkey noises towards Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford. The sports minister, Nigel Adams, wrote to the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, asking him to take \u201curgent action\u201d, with Bulgaria already having been punished with a partial stadium ban for \u201cracist incidents\u201d during a previous qualifier.\n\nUefa confirmed on Tuesday that its control, ethics and disciplinary body had opted to impose a two-match stadium ban \u2013 one match longer than is usual for a second offence \u2013 as well as ordering the Bulgaria Football Union to pay a \u20ac75,000 fine. However, the second will be suspended during a probationary period of two years.\n\nThe sanction means Bulgaria\u2019s qualifier against the Czech Republic on 17 November will be played behind closed doors, while they have also been ordered to display a banner with the words \u201cNo to Racism\u201d with the Uefa logo.\n\nIt is understood Uefa only considered the match against England as a second offence following racist chanting during the home qualifier against Kosovo in June, even though Bulgaria were also sanctioned after a banner supporting Bulgarian national resistance was displayed during their match against the Czech Republic in Prague.\n\nGuidelines state a second offence should usually carry a one-match stadium closure and a \u20ac50,000 fine, while it is estimated that the financial implications of a behind closed doors fixture could cost the BFU up to \u20ac500,000. Any subsequent offence can be punished with points being deducted or the offenders being thrown out of the competition \u2013 a fate that Fare argued should have applied in this case.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the speed of this decision but we are disappointed that Bulgaria will not be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying competition given their previous record and obvious inability to deal with the problems they face,\u201d Fare said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe think that the evidence and circumstances of this match would have justified European football being given a stronger signal on the need to tackle racism.\u201d\n\nKick It Out said: \u201cWe are disheartened but not surprised to learn of Uefa\u2019s response to the racist abuse directed at England players. In our view, they have missed an opportunity to send an uncompromising message on racism and discrimination. The current sanctions, however \u2018tough\u2019 Uefa think they may be, are clearly not working and leave victims with little faith in their ability to prevent abusive behaviour.\n\n\u201cWe feel Uefa\u2019s entire disciplinary process in response to racial discrimination should be overhauled, and urge them to explain the decision-making process behind their sanctions for incidents of discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe BFU was fined a further \u20ac10,000 for disturbances during a national anthem, with England ordered to pay \u20ac5,000 for the same offence.\n\nAfter the racism in Bulgaria, where do we go from here? \u2013 Football Weekly special Read more\n\nA spokesman for the FA said: \u201cWe sincerely hope the disgraceful scenes in Sofia are never repeated. Our priority remains our players, support team and fans and we will do all we can to ensure they never have to endure such circumstances again.\u201d\n\nThe BFU said that its work to combat racism in the past had helped them avoid more severe sanctions.\n\n\u201cThanks to the diligent and competent work of the [BFU] administration and the union\u2019s legal partners, as well as the persistent efforts to combat racism, xenophobia and tribal intolerance, the Bulgarian national team avoided more severe sanctions,\u201d read a statement.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely believe that in the future, Bulgarian football fans will prove with their behaviour that they have unjustifiably become the subject of accusations of lack of tolerance and respect for their opponents. This will be of benefit to all \u2013 for both football players and fans, as well as for Bulgaria\u2019s international sporting prestige.\u201d\n\nHartlepool have been charged by the FA following an alleged incident of racism during their National League match against Dover on 21 September. The match was held up for 10 minutes after abuse was directed at Dover\u2019s Inih Effiong by a small number of fans.", "description": "Bulgaria have been ordered by Uefa to play their next competitive home game behind closed doors after the racist chanting which marred the Euro 2020 qualifier with England", "authors": ["Ed Aarons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e6830f77cc984103c1a007386532fa8025514fe/0_129_3123_1874/master/3123.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=633229b9687d1b2d8e3fa6967e37c844", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
