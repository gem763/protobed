It was as loud here on Saturday night in appreciation of her losing effort as it has been for any of her six triumphs in New York since 1999, among the 23 grand slam titles that have garlanded her career.\n\nBianca Andreescu stuns Serena Williams to win US Open final Read more\n\nThis is significant. Support for the emotional and complex Williams has not always been unequivocal in the land where she was born, in a sport still striving to shed its white, country-club past \u2013 and making slow if welcome progress.\n\nBefore this US Open, a statue was unveiled of Althea Gibson, the first black player to contest Wimbledon. She won it twice \u2013 and won the US twice. Those who saw her compared her to Serena\u2019s sister, Venus. She railed against prejudice with a stubborn disregard for the conventions of her era, and to do so in the 1950s took immense courage.\n\nShe led the way \u2013 much as Jack Johnson did for Joe Louis who did for Muhammad Ali: fighters in every sense, but according to their own instincts. They would not be owned \u2013 unlike their ancestors who battled slavery of a different kind.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nWilliams needs no history lessons. She has been writing her own chapters in the narrative for more than two decades. She is every bit as stubborn as Gibson, as aware as Ali \u2013 but maybe not as popular. (Then again, who, black or white, was?)\n\nShe has always followed her own compass and that sometimes has led her into cul-de-sacs. She has created enough chances to add to her legacy since giving birth in September 2017, reaching the finals of four of seven slams \u2013 without winning a set.\n\nShe lost to Angelique Kerber (when she was three months into her comeback) at Wimbledon; Naomi Osaka, infamously, here; Simona Halep at Wimbledon two months ago; and, on Saturday night, Halep\u2019s devotee, a player who might be as good or better than Osaka.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Serena Williams reached the Wimbledon final earlier this summer but lost to Simona Halep.

That is a remarkable achievement \u2013 and not dissimilar to the heroics Williams has been performing since she won her own first slam here when she was 17, two years younger than Andreescu.\n\nWhether Andreescu will be as great a player as Williams nobody knows. For now and the foreseeable future, we have both of them.\n\nRafael Nadal wary of in-form Daniil Medvedev in race for ultimate prize | Kevin Mitchell Read more\n\nWhen she came off Arthur Ashe Stadium, Williams resisted suggestions that she is freezing in front of the one last challenge in her career: to equal and then pass Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 grand slam titles. It is the question that refuses to go away, and she has developed a defence to guard against it: semi-denial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily chasing a record. I\u2019m just trying to win grand slams,\u201d she told her disbelieving audience, adding with more candour: \u201cI\u2019m, like, so close, so close, so close, yet so far away. I don\u2019t know what to say. I guess I got to keep going if I want to be a professional tennis player. And I just got to just keep fighting through it.\u201d\n\nJust 48 hours earlier, however, she told ESPN something that went largely unreported, and was way more revealing: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t understand is when I get 24 \u2013 because it\u2019s inevitable \u2013 you guys are going to ask me about 25 and to pass the record. And that\u2019s what you don\u2019t get.\u201d\n\nYet there was no escaping the roar of that crowd.\n\nAnd genius should never be disregarded, because that is what has sustained her all her career and all her life.", "description": "Serena Williams has lost her past four grand slam finals but still has the fire inside to win her 24th major, the same as the Australian Margaret Court", "authors": ["Kevin Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3088c25375a36d6475ab8d37eba21c1c15223a1b/0_210_4775_2864/master/4775.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28e9038460c1eed584f7adbde248d4d4", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
