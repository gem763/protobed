The network currently reaches 70 million people.\n\nThat viewership may increase. Newsmax TV has announced a major expansion of its production capabilities and is now ready to hire staff and even new talent to spread its unapologetic conservative message. Chief executive officer Christopher Ruddy says Newsmax has spent the past several years building out the Newsmax TV network\u2019s distribution and is now close to \u201cmission accomplished,\u201d he tells Talkers Magazine, a broadcast industry publication.\n\nMr. Ruddy is now hiring dozens of producers, bookers, correspondents, anchors and show hosts according to the source.\n\nNewsmax has had \u201cmeteoric growth\u201d Mr. Ruddy says, and believes there\u2019s room for more conservatives in American media.\n\n\u201cI like Fox News Channel, but we believe the country needs more conservative voices, not less. Imagine if there was just one conservative website or just one talk radio network,\u201d says the CEO, who plans to muscle up his network and up its competitive ante for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAnd one more thing. The production operation is based in New York; Talkers Magazine advises interested potential staffers to send their resumes to [email protected] Indeed, Newsmax is already posting job openings online at job sites frequented by the media community.\n\nQUESTION OF THE MOMENT\n\n\u201cHow long can Democrats live on a diet of Nothingburgers?\u201d\n\nSo asks Stephen Kruiser, associate editor of PJ Media, citing the Democratic Party\u2019s never-ending zeal to trip up President Trump on a variety of issues.\n\n\u201cMy answer is a simple: one side is operating in the real world, and one has been swimming in a sea of delusion for over three years,\u201d writes Mr. Kruiser.\n\nGALLUP: REPUBLICANS STILL CONDEMN THE MEDIA\n\n\u201cAmericans remain largely mistrustful of the mass media as 41% currently have \u2018a great deal\u2019 or \u2018fair amount\u2019 of trust in newspapers, television and radio to report the news fully, accurately and fairly. This latest reading represents a four-percentage-point dip since last year,\u201d writes Gallup analyst Megan Brenan.\n\nThe findings are tepid, but not as tepid as 2016 when trust in the media hit a record low of 32%. Democrats appear pretty pleased with the media: 69% say they trust it, along with 36% of independents.\n\nRepublicans are a completely different story.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s description of the media as \u2018the enemy of the people\u2019 has undoubtedly colored the views of all Americans. Republicans became increasingly mistrustful of the media in 2016 when Trump was campaigning for president and was sharply critical of the media\u2019s coverage of him. Between 2015 and 2016, Republican trust in the mass media fell 18 points to its historical low of 14%, where it remained in 2017. Following a seven-point boost last year, it has returned to 15%,\u201d Ms. Brenan notes.\n\n\u2018AN IN-KIND CONTRIBUTION\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s some wisdom as impeachment controversy continues to percolate.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s one of the dumbest and most ridiculous political moves that we\u2019ve seen in history,\u201d former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cI think this should be looked at as an in-kind contribution to the president\u2019s reelection campaign. All this is doing is helping fuel his campaign. They\u2019re raising more money. They\u2019re rallying his base and they\u2019re unifying the Republican Party by attacking this president,\u201d she says.\n\nIMPEACHMENT TWEETS UP 469%\n\nThe data is already in about the rush of Twitter activity centered on the possible impeachment of President Trump. The analytical results are, well, unpredictable.\n\nSEMrush\u2014 an online visibility management and content marketing platform \u2014 examined the chatter surrounding impeachment,and here is what they found:\n\n\u201cSearches for \u2018Trump impeachment\u2019 increased 469% from September 23 to 25,\u201d says the organization, which also found that impeachment tweets were also at peak levels in May, February and November \u2014 of 2017.\n\n\u201cTweets about Trump are surprisingly more neutral than polarizing when looking at data from September 23, 2019 to September 25, 2019. 6.04% were negative, 9.43% were positive, and 84.53% were neutral,\u201d the group says.\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale: Laramie River Overlook, custom-built stone and wood ranch home on 44 acres near Wheatland, Wyoming.
