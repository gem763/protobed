Marching bands played Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy \u2014 infusing life into what was, decades ago, an abandoned quarry on the outskirts of town.\n\nThat town, Matera \u2014 famous for the 9,000-year-old cave dwellings of its Sassi \u2014 is enjoying a moment in the sun as a European Capital of Culture. The aforementioned meeting point \u2014 appropriately named Cava del Sole (\u2018Quarry of the Sun\u2019) \u2013 is where the Matera 2019 festivities kicked off.\n\nThe Cava is central to Matera\u2019s origin story. Workers carved out the quarry, which dates back to the 18th century, through blood, sweat and tears. The resulting blocks of tuff became the building materials for Matera\u2019s monuments and stone homes.\n\nHowever, in the 1950s, with Matera in a state of disrepair, residents were relocated to nearby modern housing, and the Cava del Sole was eventually left behind.\n\nBut it takes a village, and Materans are resilient villagers. In the 1980s, its artisans, along with young creative Italians, reclaimed and revived their lost cave city. Today, it is emblematic of a Neolithic-meets-Digital Age Renaissance.\n\nThe Cava del Sole went through a revamp too, in the lead-up to Matera 2019. It now includes such modern features as a 7,000-capacity outdoor entertainment arena, and a modern conference hall.\n\nAs visitors from all over the world have poured into these and other exhibition sites throughout 2019, the Southern Italian village has become a global village.\n\n\u00a9Luca Centola\n\nAtelier of the World\n\nJust as the ancient stone town was re-shaped at the hands of forward-thinking creatives, artists from all over the world are playing a big role in the last few months of this landmark year, as initiatives see them paired with local Basilicata communities for Matera Residencies 2019.\n\nResidents open their doors to visiting creators, ushering in an unforgettable cultural exchange. Artists get a chance to experience regional tradition and hospitality. In turn, they teach locals new skills and share their own visions of Matera via their work.\n\nAnother such programme, Gardentopia injects inventive energy into forgotten exurban zones. There, on the edges of towns, global creators, landscape designers and the community collaborate to literally and figuratively cultivate a \u2018greener Basilicata\u2019 through vegetable and flower gardens.\n\nAnd as part of Altofest, townspeople are welcoming international artists into their homes, where live audiences can enjoy contemporary art performances. Taking place between 4 November and 8 December, the programme\u2019s theme is \u2018Living in the Future\u2019.\n\nSimilarly casting a gaze ahead.. to 2024, Feldkirch, a contender for that year\u2019s European Capital of Culture designation, is partnering with Matera on the Pulverturm Artist Residency Project.\n\nIts aim is to establish a network of creators from both locales by inviting artists from Matera and the Basilicata to stay in the Austrian city starting in 2020. Continuing for several years, the initiative features a distinct theme each year, with the first being figurative art.\n\nPlotera Weeks - Plovdiv and Matera Together For an Open Future\n\nIn the meantime, the current European culture capitals, Matera and Plovdiv, are culminating a blockbuster year with their own joint projects \u2014 bridging the 1,000 km which separate the Italian town from the Bulgarian city.\n\nAmong them is another international artists\u2019 residency. European Eyes on Japan is a decades-long programme which brings European photographers to Japan to chronicle the lives of its citizens \u2014 particularly those living in rural and marginalised areas. The resulting images can be seen in publications, as well as exhibitions in Japan and the European Capitals of Culture.\n\nThis year, photographers Alessia Rollo from Matera and Vladimir Tochigi from Plovdiv were chosen to participate. Their work was on display this summer in Matera\u2019s 11th century Church of Santa Maria de Armenis, and shows again in Plovdiv between 21 October and 27 November. The exhibition heads to Japan in 2020.\n\nThe European Capitals of Culture continue to explore the theme of cast-aside quarters in the Fusion Urban Games Festival (between 31 October through 10 November).\n\nCurious visitors and residents can take to the streets, parks, deserted spaces and intriguing undergrounds of Matera and Plovdiv for games which inspire players to delve into issues like our relationships to cities and technology, and what it means to live in urban peripheries during the mobility era.\n\n\u00a9Luca Centola\n\nBack to Where it All Began\n\nThe sun will begin to set on Matera 2019 with the Festival of Open Culture, taking place at various citywide locations starting 7 December and running through 20 December, the date of the year\u2019s official closing festivities.\n\nThe events are expected to draw visionary creators and big thinkers for a synergy of ideas, music, design, literature, theatre and cinema.\n\nAt the closing ceremony, guests will gather in the spot where it all started, where steel meets stone: The Cava del Sole. As Italian and European musicians perform, images which tell the story of the town\u2019s 12 months as a European culture capital, will be projected onto walls,\u2014 with the whole spectacle broadcasting live.\n\nBut looking back also means looking forward. Matera has now cemented its legacy as a key international destination for inclusive cultural projects co-created by artists and residents \u2014 together: global villagers.\n\nThis citizenry should also include immigrants from the Mediterranean and beyond, insists Paolo Verri, Director of the Matera-Basilicata 2019 Foundation. His words echo the sentiment which likely inspired European experts to select the town for their 2019 designation: \u201cIf not the capital of culture, Matera was already the appointed capital of hospitality.\u201d\n\nThe opening of Matera 2019 was of course punctuated by a classical anthem. In a similar spirit, its conclusion on 20 December will showcase the shift from analog to digital sounds \u2014 using music to drive home another poignant message. Like Matera, any community can grow and evolve when global villagers come together to re-imagine an old culture through a new lens.\n\nMatera 2019\u2019s Festival of Open Culture - Highlights\n\n\u2022 A Start-up is Born: spotlight on fresh projects/businesses launched in 2019\n\n\u2022 Matera 3019: a multimedia \u2018play\u2019 in which a future world is imagined by Italian and European youngsters\n\n\u2022 Deep Dive Into Digitisation: through educational activities organised in collaboration with major players in communication and digital technology\n\n\u2022 Passing of the torch to 2020 European Capitals of Culture: Galway, Ireland and Rijeka, Croatia", "description": "In January, thousands of citizens of Italy\u2019s Basilicata region gathered in a unique location to celebrate an historic occasion through music \u2014 which reverberated around adjacent tuff rock.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/29/40/1000x563_cmsv2_d32fa80e-d3fc-5eb2-a2ff-85f1c9a234da-4252940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
