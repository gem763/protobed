Turkey considers those fighters a threat to its own borders and security.\n\nMr. Trump knows Turkey from his earlier life in real estate \u2014 he sold his brand name to the Trump Towers Istanbul in 2010 \u2014 but like presidents before him, he has struggled to devise a consistent policy toward the country.\n\nInstead, he has focused on his personal relationship with Mr. Erdogan in conversations that people familiar with them describe as typically \u201cfawning.\u201d Mr. Trump usually begins by praising Mr. Erdogan, who is himself notorious for haranguing American presidents with grievances, according to those people.\n\n\u201cWe have a great friendship as countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an appearance with Mr. Erdogan that September. \u201cI think we\u2019re, right now, as close as we have ever been. And a lot of that has to do with the personal relationship.\u201d The following July, he was spotted fist-bumping the Turkish leader at a NATO summit in Brussels.\n\nThat chumminess has unsettled both appointed and elected officials suspicious of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s repressive policies, Islamist sympathies and deepening relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Nearly everyone agrees, however, that simply shunning the head of a NATO-member nation at the pivot point between East and West is not practical.\n\nThe Trump-Erdogan friendship has already survived at least one major test, when relations flared over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s continued detention of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was jailed for nearly two years in a widespread crackdown after a failed coup in Turkey. When Mr. Brunson was not freed as he expected, Mr. Trump announced in a hostile tweet that he was doubling tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum and watching the Turkish lira slide.\n\nAfter Mr. Brunson was freed last October, Mr. Trump expressed public gratitude to Mr. Erdogan for \u201cmaking this possible.\u201d", "description": "The Turkish leader has repeatedly talked the president around to his view of the world.", "authors": ["Michael Crowley", "Carlotta Gall"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/us/politics/08dc-trumperdogan/merlin_162369690_a81ed3e0-463c-4034-a0ca-bc8b6ed05a53-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
