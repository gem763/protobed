(John Locher, AP)\n\nA single ticket sold in Wisconsin matched all six numbers in the Wednesday night Powerball drawing to win the third-largest jackpot in US lottery history. Due to strong ticket sales, the jackpot climbed to an estimated $768.4m at the time of the drawing with a cash option of $477m.\n\nPowerball said the winning numbers are 16, 20, 37, 44, 62 and the Powerball number is 12.\n\nThe $768.4m is the third-largest behind the world record $1.586bn Powerball jackpot shared by winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, and the $1.537bn Mega Millions jackpot won in South Carolina last October.\n\n\"It's going to be a very green spring for our first Powerball jackpot winner of 2019,\" David Barden, Powerball Product Group chairperson and New Mexico Lottery CEO, said in a statement. \"A jackpot of this size can make many dreams come true \u2013 not just for the winner, but for all Lottery beneficiaries and the lucky state of Wisconsin.\"\n\nAlthough the prize has grown steadily since the last jackpot winner on December 26, the odds of matching the five white balls and single Powerball remain one in 292.2 million.\n\nThe $768.4m estimated figure refers to the annuity option, paid over 29 years. Nearly all grand prize winners opt for the cash prize, which for Wednesday's drawing would be an estimated $477m. Both prize options are before taxes.\n\nSeven tickets matched all five white balls, but missed matching the red Powerball in Wednesday's drawing to win a $1m prize. Those tickets were sold in Arizona, two in California, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey and New York. Two other tickets, sold in Kansas and Minnesota, matched all five white balls and doubled the prize to $2m, because the tickets included the Power Play option for an additional $1.\n\nPowerball is played in 44 states, plus Washington, DC, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A single ticket sold in Wisconsin matched all six numbers in the Powerball drawing to win the third-largest jackpot in US lottery history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8682/5c2beabbd2704936a2f6e6a1900389dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-29"}
