And yet, it still has no good way of spotting the ball after plays, which can lead to huge swings in games.\n\nLuckily for the NFL, a weird moment Thursday night didn\u2019t end up affecting the outcome of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers-Carolina Panthers game. But it easily could have.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt started just before the two-minute warning. Panthers receiver D.J. Moore made a catch but was short of the first down. Then, when a second official spotted the ball, he wasn\u2019t.\n\nSpot of the ball clearly changed\n\nMoore seemed to be short of the first down. Due to the yellow line on broadcasts, we\u2019re all very aware of where the first-down marker is. The initial spot had Moore short of the first. It was going to set up a fourth-and-1 for the Panthers. Then everyone saw what happened next.\n\nThis is science pic.twitter.com/dkHcaDGYgi \u2014 Steve Palazzolo (@PFF_Steve) September 13, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s an imprecise system, and the officials had to move fast because the Panthers were in hurry-up mode. But that can\u2019t happen. The ball moved forward enough to go from it being fourth-and-1 (which seemed to be the correct spot) to first-and-10.\n\nThe game went to the two-minute warning, and when the broadcast returned it was first-and-10 for the Panthers. There was no challenge or review.\n\nNo challenge came from Bucs\n\nThe Buccaneers should have challenged before the two-minute warning, but were probably unaware of the incorrect spot. It was easy to see on television due to the yellow line superimposed on the field, and not so easy to see the ball moving forward a couple feet from the sideline.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s odd that after all these years there\u2019s not a more precise system. Officials will eyeball the spot, which can be off by a lot sometimes, then measure the first down by the slightest measurement using the links of the first-down chain. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nThe NFL avoided what could have been a major controversy. Had the Panthers won, many Buccaneers fans would have cited that play over and over. As we saw at the end of the drive, the Panthers were no sure thing to pick up a fourth-and-1.\n\nAlas, it might not be long until the next NFL officiating controversy sticks.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians talks with officials during Thursday night's game.
