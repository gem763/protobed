Michael Bennet\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden*\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker*\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg*\n\nFormer HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro*\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\n\nFormer Maryland Rep. John Delaney\n\nHawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard*\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand*\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris*\n\nFormer Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee*\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar*\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke*\n\nOhio Rep. Tim Ryan\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders*\n\nCalifornia Rep. Eric Swalwell\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren*\n\nWriter and spiritual guru Marianne Williamson*\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang*\n\nIn order to qualify, all candidates had to hit either a fundraising or a polling threshold. For fundraising, candidates had to have at least 65,000 donors and at least 200 donors in each of 20 states. For polling, candidates had to garner at least 1% support in at least three national or early-state polls.\n\nCandidates marked with an asterisk (*) above met both thresholds according to the DNC.\n\nOn Friday, the DNC is set to announce which 10 candidates will take the stage on each night of the debates on June 26 and 27.\n\nOf the 23 major candidates in the race, three did not make the first debate: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock; Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam; and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton.\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nNot all of the candidates agree with the DNC's assessment. On Thursday morning, Bullock's campaign sent a letter to the DNC making the case that he should be in the debate.\n\nAt issue is one ABC News/Washington Post poll from February, which had Bullock registering 1% support. Bullock's camp lists this among his qualifying poll results. And indeed, in its initial qualifying criteria, the DNC listed both ABC and Washington Post polls as qualifying polls.\n\nThe DNC recently told Politico that it would not count that poll because it asked voters whom they would support in the primary in an open-ended fashion, rather than having them pick from a list.\n\nBullock waited to enter the race until the Montana legislature was out of session, which also gave him less time to try to amass 65,000 donors.", "description": "A total of 20 candidates will debate over two nights in late June.
