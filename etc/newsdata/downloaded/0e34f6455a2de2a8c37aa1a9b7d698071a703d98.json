Anderson had two more hits in his pursuit of the American League batting title.\n\n\u201cI hope that any time we go out and play a decent ballgame it\u2019s a foreshadow of what we want to be,\u201d Chicago manager Rick Renteria said. \u201cThat will ultimately be the goal, and we want it to start occurring sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nDylan Cease (4-7) allowed a run and five hits in six innings - the first quality start for the White Sox since Sept. 6. Cease struck out eight with two walks.\n\nThe White Sox chased Jordan Zimmermann (1-12) in the fourth. The Detroit right-hander allowed several hard-hit balls and received little help from his defense, which made three errors in the first four innings.\n\n\u201cThey know what happened. I don\u2019t have to run in there and yell at them,\u201d Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. \u201cWe talk to them in the dugout whenever something happens, but I wish we weren\u2019t having to do that every night.\u201d\n\nMoncada\u2019s two-run homer in the third put the White Sox up 4-0. The Tigers intentionally walked him the following inning to load the bases, and Jim\u00e9nez followed with a drive to right for the rookie outfielder\u2019s 29th home run of the year. That made the score 9-1 and ended Zimmermann\u2019s outing.\n\n\u201cIt was out of the zone - high fastball,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cWhen I hit it, I say that it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nZimmermann allowed nine runs and 11 hits in 3 2/3 innings.\n\n\u201cEverything I threw up there either got hit hard or found a hole,\u201d Zimmermann said.\n\nAnderson doubled and singled and raised his league-leading average from .335 to .336. DJ LeMahieu of the New York Yankees is at .328.\n\nDetroit (45-108) is likely to pick first in the draft for the second time in three years. The Tigers have baseball\u2019s worst record, and the closest team to them is Baltimore, which won Friday to move 4 \u00bd games above Detroit.\n\nJim\u00e9nez finished a double shy of the cycle and was certainly aware of that after the game.\n\n\u201cNext question please,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\nYolmer Sanchez had four hits for Chicago.\n\nGOOD MATCHUP\n\nThree of Cease\u2019s four wins have come against Detroit. He\u2019s 3-0 with a 3.38 ERA against the Tigers in this, his debut season.\n\nFINALLY\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough year for Daniel Palka, who hit 27 home runs for the White Sox as a rookie in 2018 but has bounced back and forth between the majors and minors this season. Palka was 2 for 64 at the plate for Chicago before going 3 for 5 on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s handled it well,\u201d Renteria said. \u201cHe\u2019s kept his nose to the grindstone. Keeps trying to give you as good at-bats as he can.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nWhite Sox: Chicago put RHP Dylan Covey (right shoulder inflammation) on the injured list, retroactive to Monday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWhite Sox: Ivan Nova (10-12) is slated to start for Chicago in the second game of this series.\n\nTigers: Tyler Alexander (1-3) takes the mound for Detroit.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Eloy Jim\u00e9nez, Yo\u00e1n Moncada and Tim Anderson are giving Chicago some encouraging glimpses of a better future for the White Sox.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/white_sox_tigers_baseball_23887_c0-183-4385-2739_s1770x1032.jpg?eb14b066b53736646c6f8c6ec71f16ebdbe56a5c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
