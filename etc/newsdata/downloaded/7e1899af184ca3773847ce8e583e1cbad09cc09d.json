Max Rose, D-N.Y., called on the United States to penalize Chinese pharmaceutical companies for their role in supplying massive amounts of fentanyl that ultimately took American lives.\n\n\"It's time that we show these Chinese pharmaceutical companies -- that are making a profit off of killing Americans -- that there are significant consequences to that,\" Rose said during \"Your World\" on Saturday.\n\nRose, co-sponsor of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, also praised President Trump's focus on the issue and claimed the United States had \"zero doubt\" that China was behind fentanyl trafficking.\n\n\"90 percent of the fentanyl coming into the country right now -- fentanyl that's killing our kids across the country -- is coming directly from China,\" he told Fox News host Neil Cavuto.\n\nFREE BEACON EDITOR IN CHIEF: TRUMP IS ASKING CHINA TO 'PAY A PRICE' IT CAN'T AFFORD\n\nHe added that while the rest comes from Mexico, the original source is China. \"We have got to put sanctions on these Chinese pharmaceutical companies that are still willingly shipping fentanyl onto our shores,\" he said -- adding that he didn't believe China's word that it was trying to combat the trafficking.\n\nRose called for an on-site lab at John F.
