You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAmid a growing backlash, the health secretary rowed back from his comments, telling Channel 4: \u201cI know Charlotte well and I entirely trust what she has to say\u201d.\n\nEx-Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd dealt a fresh blow to the prime minister, by publicly declaring she agreed with Mr Hancock.\n\nThe row cast a dark cloud over the first day of the party's conference in Manchester and comes after the prime minister was forced to deny any conflict of interest over his involvement with an American businesswoman while he was London mayor.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Times Style, Ms Edwardes said: \u201cI\u2019m seated on Johnson\u2019s right; on his left is a young woman I know.\n\n\u201cMore wine is poured; more wine is drunk. Under the table I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.\n\n\u201cMy mother always said: \u2018Wear a badge to the cinema with which to stab wandering hands\u2019. But this is work, so I am silent.\u201d\n\nDowning Street categorically denied the account. A No 10 spokesman said: \"This allegation is untrue.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The health secretary should apologise for his disgraceful remarks.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister must be held to account for these accusations. No man, no matter how powerful, should get away with abusing his position to harass women.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson said: \u201cA boss putting his hand on a junior colleague\u2019s inner thigh isn\u2019t a \u2018private matter\u2019, Matt Hancock; it\u2019s sexual harassment and an abuse of power.\n\n\u201cAppalling to suggest otherwise.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Jess Phillips said: \u201cIt\u2019s always a private matter when it\u2019s the PM, I\u2019m guessing they won\u2019t be pushing forward with legislation on sexual harassment that Penny Mordaunt had started the consultation on, so he isn\u2019t embarrassed progress will slow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so tiring and predictable.\u201d\n\nHowever, female Tory MPs defended the prime minister over attacks on his character.\n\nPenny Mordaunt, who was sacked as defence secretary by the prime minister, said he was a \u201cdecent person\u201d who cares a \u201cgreat deal\u201d about the problems facing women and girls.\n\nAt a fringe event in Manchester, Ms Mordaunt said: \u201cHe is not the individual that he is quite often painted as being.\n\n\u201cHe occasionally has the style of Frank Spencer in a china shop. But he\u2019s a decent person. I think he cares a great deal about women and girls.\n\n\u201cAnd certainly that was my experience when he was foreign secretary.\u201d\n\nLiz Truss, the women\u2019s minister, claimed she had not seen the allegations when asked by The Independent at a fringe event.\n\nShe said: \u201cI haven\u2019t read that particular story, I have been in a series of meetings.\u201d\n\nMs Truss said the prime minister was \u201cabsolutely a feminist\u201d, adding: \u201cHe has shown that time and time again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also somebody who believes in equality right across the board.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the prime minister denied any conflict of interest in the award of grants and access to his friend Jennifer Arcuri while he was mayor of London.\n\nIn an interview on BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson was asked whether he declared an interest under the Greater London Authority\u2019s code of conduct over the award to Ms Arcuri of public money and privileged access to mayoral trade missions.\n\nHe replied: \u201cThere was no interest to declare.\u201d\n\nAnd he added: \u201cEverything was done in accordance with the code ... and everything was done with full propriety.\u201d", "description": "Downing Street has been forced to deny allegations Boris Johnson groped a female journalist as a storm of outrage threatened to overshadow\u00a0the party's annual conference.
