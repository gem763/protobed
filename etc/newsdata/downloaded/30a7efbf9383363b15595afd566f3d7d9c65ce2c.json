After its finale last spring, the HBO behemoth is now looming over the Emmy Awards, airing Sunday night on Fox. Despite that and other odds-on nominees, there\u2019s room for surprises in the competition and the awards show itself. Here are five things to keep an eye on at the 71st Emmys.\n\nA Host-less Show\n\nEven before controversy caused Kevin Hart to bail out as host of the Oscars, Emmy organizers decided not to recruit a host this year, producers say, in part because they knew celebrities are increasingly leery of such gigs. Plus, by skipping a monologue and other host-led bits, producers gained more show time to work with. Roughly 21 minutes are allotted to stuff other than the announcing and accepting of awards, 27 of which have to be handed out during the three-hour telecast.\n\nHowever, the lack of a host doesn\u2019t give winners time to ramble on in their acceptance speeches. As nominees are reminded, \u201cThere is a thank-you cam offstage, where they can continue thanking their cat, their dog and their agent,\u201d says executive producer Ian Stewart, whose company Done+Dusted is running this year\u2019s show in tandem with Don Mischer Productions.\n\nMr. Mischer, a veteran producer of such spectacles, adds, \u201cThe two things that make these shows successful are: who wins, and what they say when they get up there. As producers, we have absolutely no control over that.\u201d\n\nNetflix\u2019s \u2018When They See Us,\u2019 a dramatization of the story of the five teenagers wrongly imprisoned for a 1989 assault on a jogger in Central Park, is a contender for the limited-series award.

Last year, Netflix topped HBO in total nominations, 112 vs. 108, breaking HBO\u2019s 17-year streak as the most-nominated network. Ultimately, the two industry heavyweights tied for the most Emmy wins in 2018.\n\nThis year, HBO landed back on top with 137 total nominations, breaking its own record, thanks in large part to a flood of nominations for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (more on that below). Netflix came in second with 118 nominations, while NBC was a distant third place with 58 nods.\n\nThough Netflix has proved masterful at awards campaigning, having secured nominations in almost every category, the streamer has so far been denied a crowning win in a series-level category. In recent years, Netflix looked on as direct rivals became the first streamers to win best drama series (Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d) and best comedy series (Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel \u201d).\n\nOn Sunday Netflix does have a shot at seizing its first top award in the category of limited series (aka miniseries). This award has seesawed between HBO and cable network FX in recent years. Netflix has a strong contender in \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d director Ava DuVernay\u2019s dramatization of the story of the five teenagers wrongly imprisoned for a 1989 assault on a jogger in Central Park.\n\nThe Dragon in the Room\n\nThough the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was divisive, to put it mildly, Emmy voters have been eager to honor the last lap around the track for a series whose scale and success changed the industry.\n\nWith 32 total nominations, a record for any series in a single season, the show is expected to win best drama (as it did for its previous two seasons) and also break the record \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d previously set, in 2015, for the most single-year awards for a series.\n\nIn addition to an expected farewell tribute during the awards show, settle in for lots of \u201cGame\u201d-related names. The drama categories are stacked with them, including best supporting actress, where four out of six nominees played characters in the fictional kingdom of Westeros: Gwendoline Christie, Lena Headey, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams.\n\nTony Hale, Gary Cole and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in \u2018Veep,\u2019 which ended this season.

But that showing pales next to Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s streak. If she gets the award for lead actress in a comedy series on Sunday night, it would be her seventh win for her role in the scathing political satire. That would break her tie with Cloris Leachman as the performer with the most overall acting wins.\n\nYet \u201cVeep\u201d is facing a field of critical hits: \u201c Barry \u201d (HBO), \u201cFleabag\u201d (Amazon), \u201cRussian Doll\u201d (Netflix), \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d (Pop TV), \u201cThe Good Place\u201d (NBC) and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d (Amazon).\n\nThe latter, set in the stand-up comedy scene of the 1950s and \u201960s, took home the top comedy award last year, and seems to have a head of steam. The show earned six trophies, the most of any comedy series, at last week\u2019s Creative Arts Emmys for categories not featured in the main telecast.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge created and stars in Amazon\u2019s \u2018Fleabag,\u2019 which is up for the comedy-series award.

When Henry Winkler won his first Emmy last year, for his supporting role as a self-obsessed acting coach in HBO\u2019s \u201cBarry,\u201d he got a standing ovation and read a speech he said he\u2019d written 43 years previously, when he was known as the Fonz. Producer Don Mischer says that moment caused the energy level in the theater to soar.\n\nThis year, keep an eye on British phenom Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She created and starred in the darkly comic character study \u201cFleabag,\u201d whose second season (on Amazon) has been one of the most critically acclaimed runs of the year. \u201cFleabag\u201d is up for the comedy-series award, and Ms. Waller-Bridge is nominated for lead actress.\n\nOh, and she also created the stylish thriller \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d which has multiple nominations, including best drama, and put two cast members into the running for lead actress: Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh. A win for Ms. Oh, an eight-time Emmy nominee, would make her the first actress of Asian descent to take home the top award.\n\nWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com", "description": "Another farewell to \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and a close race in comedy are among things to watch for in Sunday\u2019s awards show for television", "authors": ["John Jurgensen", "John.Jurgensen Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109266/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
