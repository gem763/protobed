REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar and British pound were steady on Wednesday as European Union leaders consider Britain\u2019s request for a Brexit delay, and are expected to grant a three-month extension to the Oct. 31 deadline for its departure.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter he had recommended late on Tuesday that EU leaders back a delay. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced by parliament to ask for three months, but there is still a chance that some EU countries, notably France, could demand a shorter extension.\n\nJohnson paused his bill to enact the Brexit deal he struck last week with the European Union\u2019s 27 other member states, after dramatic votes on Tuesday in which the British parliament accepted the deal in principle but rejected a three-day timetable for passing the necessary legislation.\n\nForeign exchange trading was generally quiet following a sell-off Tuesday that saw the pound drop against both the dollar and the euro. Against the dollar, the pound was last down 0.02% to $1.287 GBP=. Against the euro, the pound was 0.8% stronger to 86.34 pence EURGBP=.\n\nThe dollar index was up 0.08% at 97.606 .DXY.\n\n\u201cWith Brexit on ice for now, attention has shifted to the EU to see if indeed it grants the UK more time \u2013 likely three months or less. While weaker, the bottom hasn\u2019t fallen out of the pound given that a no-deal Brexit has seemingly been taken off the table. Expecting the unexpected with respect to Brexit \u2013 and sterling \u2013 remains a central theme,\u201d said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.\n\nJohnson did not follow through on his threat to pull the deal if parliament defeated him on the timetable, which was understood by the market as all but eliminating the chances of no-deal exit.\n\n\u201cThings could change very quickly today, depending on the EU response,\u201d said Adam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, adding, however, that he did not see much downside risk now that a no-deal Brexit appeared to be ruled out.\n\nSafe haven currencies earlier Wednesday had been boosted by the Brexit uncertainty. But after the EU was seen as likely to approve an extension, gains in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc faded. The yen JPY= was last marginally lower at 108.55 per dollar, with the franc CHF= at 0.991 per dollar.", "description": "The dollar and British pound were steady on Wednesday as European Union leaders consider Britain's request for a Brexit delay, and are expected to grant a three-month extension to the Oct. 31 deadline for its departure.", "authors": ["Kate Duguid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444090329&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M10M", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
