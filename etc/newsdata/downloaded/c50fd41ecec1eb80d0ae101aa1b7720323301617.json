Hong Kong Government Takes Out Overseas Ad to Reassure Investors\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong\u2019s government has taken out an advertisement overseas as it seeks to reassure investors the city is stable and the economy is strong.\n\nA full-page advertisement attributed to the government appeared in Thursday\u2019s edition of the Australian Financial Review, a publication aimed at the business community.\n\n\u201cYou have read a lot, seen a lot, heard a lot about the events and protests in Hong Kong,\u201d it starts. \u201cBut what you read, see, hear -- or \u2018share\u2019 on social media -- is just one piece of a complex social, economic and political jigsaw puzzle. It is a puzzle that we will solve on our own. And, it may take time.\u201d\n\nThe ad points out that Hong Kong\u2019s government is committed to \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d, has a tradition of peaceful protest, but rejects the use of violence.\n\n\u201cDespite recent disruptions, the fundamentals and institutional underpinning of our economy and society are strong,\u201d the advertisement reads. \u201cWe remain a safe, open, welcoming and cosmopolitan society and an internationally connected, vibrant and dynamic economy. We will no doubt bounce back. We always do.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been gripped by the worst unrest since the former colony\u2019s return to Chinese rule in 1997, sparked by proposed legislation to allow extraditions to mainland China. Protests have disrupted the global financial hub\u2019s streets, subways and airport, resulting in more than 1,100 arrests. In a bid to quell three months of violence, the city\u2019s Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Wednesday formally withdrew the extradition bill.\n\nAustralia hosts a large Chinese diaspora, which has become engaged in the debate over Hong Kong\u2019s future. Rallies have been held in major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne as well as on university campuses, with tensions high between supporters of the mainland government and pro-Hong Kong democracy campaigners who have taken out their own newspaper ads in recent weeks.", "description": "Hong Kong Government Takes Out Overseas Ad to Reassure Investors", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1N0WX_L.jpg"}
