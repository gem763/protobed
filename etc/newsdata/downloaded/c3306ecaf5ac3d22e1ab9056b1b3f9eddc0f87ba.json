These states, with their privileged position in the nominating contests of both parties, harbor countless citizens who don\u2019t believe a candidate has earned their votes until and unless they\u2019ve asked for them in person. The locals have no compunction whatsoever about shaking down said candidates for all sorts of things, ranging from support for their provincial obsessions (e.g., the anti-tax pledges extorted by New Hampshire Republicans or the bipartisan Iowa demands on behalf of the Great Corn Idol of ethanol subsidies) to some fundraising help for state legislative candidates. And when actual voting grows nigh, the weather in these two states can turn as icy as the glare of voters if you challenge their political duopoly. I mean, there\u2019s a reason campaign staffers sometimes refer to the largest city in New Hampshire as \u201cMancharctica\u201d (as I discovered when visiting the place during a blizzard in December of 2003).\n\nSo if you are, say, Joe Biden, the front-running former vice-president with a broad path to the presidential nomination, you might be tempted to deny that total victory in Iowa and New Hampshire is essential. And in fact, his staff is testing out that theory on the political commentariat this very week, as Politico reports:\n\nBiden advisers have said they\u2019ve laid the groundwork in early voting states but \u201care now ramping up for Super Tuesday and beyond,\u201d and they have no expectation other top-tier candidates will leave the race after the first contests.\n\n\u201cWe feel we are going to be in a very dominant spot,\u201d after the first four early states, another adviser said.\n\nStill, the campaign downplayed expectations in first-in-the-nation Iowa as well as in the first primary state, New Hampshire, which borders the home states of Warren and Sanders.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, historically, there\u2019s an incredible home field advantage for a Massachusetts candidate or a New Englander,\u201d an adviser said.\n\nThe heretical idea that Biden doesn\u2019t have to win either of the traditional table-setters seems to becoming a staple talking point of Uncle Joe\u2019s people, right along with his alleged superior \u201celectability\u201d against Donald Trump. As many observers instantly pointed out, though, only one major-party candidate has ever won the ultimate prize without winning either state since the modern voter-controlled nomination process emerged in the 1970s, and that candidate didn\u2019t actually lose Iowa (in 1992, Bill Clinton safely skipped Iowa since the state\u2019s own beloved Senator Tom Harkin was running, which basically took it off the table). Candidates who tried to skip (e.g., Al Gore in 1988) or shirk (e.g., Rudy Giuliani in 2008) Iowa and New Hampshire have most definitely come to grief.\n\nAs Jonathan Bernstein points out, this history represents a pretty small and illogical sample when you think it through:\n\nRemember, we\u2019ve only had a handful of competitive nomination contests, and even fewer that lacked an overwhelming favorite. That means we\u2019ve seen only a small number of the scenarios that could plausibly play out. It\u2019s easy to imagine a strong candidate with broad support finishing behind a factional candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire (or two different factional candidates) and then gaining in other states. Or two weak candidates with particular appeal in Iowa and New Hampshire could win early but fail to catch on elsewhere. Hey, if it hadn\u2019t been for his debate \u201cglitch\u201d in 2016, Marco Rubio conceivably could\u2019ve finished second in New Hampshire after taking third in Iowa, and then won South Carolina.\n\nPerhaps the strongest argument against the Essential Duopoly Premise is that since 2008, Iowa and New Hampshire have been joined in the charmed circle of protected early states by Nevada and South Carolina, mostly because (a) both parties, and particularly Democrats, were embarrassed by the unrepresentative nature of the first two lily-white states, and (b) pols in Iowa and New Hampshire decided their protected status would be tougher to breech if they had more allies. So it certainly makes sense for Biden, whose best early-state bet is South Carolina, to treat the four opening acts as a unit.\n\nAnd indeed, Biden\u2019s not looking so hot in the first two states at this point. In the RealClearPolitics polling averages, he\u2019s at 26 percent in Iowa, just eight points ahead of Elizabeth Warren, who has a king-hell organization in the state and a lot of enthusiasm. In New Hampshire, he\u2019s in even more trouble: at 21 percent, he\u2019s less than two points ahead of Bernie Sanders (who trounced Hillary Clinton in the Granite State in 2016) and less than seven points ahead of Warren. But in Nevada, he\u2019s at 30 percent, which is nearly double the level of support for Warren and Sanders (who are tied at 15.3). And in South Carolina, Biden is at 38 percent, with Sanders, Warren, and Harris bunched together in the low teens.\n\nBeyond the \u201cearly states,\u201d it\u2019s understandable that Team Biden is talking about Super Tuesday (March 3), because that day features a large number of states awarding tons of delegates (notably California and Texas). Unless Biden has already dropped out by then, he\u2019s going to get a lot of them.\n\nLooking at it all objectively, there are actually two reasons why Iowa and New Hampshire could benefit Biden in the long run, even if he loses both states. First of all, it would be extremely helpful to him if both Sanders and Warren stay in the race as long as possible and neither is able to consolidate a progressive and/or anti-Biden bloc. One plausible scenario is that Warren wins Iowa and Sanders wins New Hampshire. If that happens, both candidates should have the juice to keep going at least until Super Tuesday and perhaps well beyond it. Second of all, the first two states could knock out potential rivals of Biden for the votes of moderate Democrats and of African-Americans. On the latter front, nothing could help Biden more in the overall delegate chase than for Kamala Harris and Cory Booker to crash and burn early on.\n\nConversely, of course, the enormous media and voter attention paid to Iowa in particular could give the winner, or even a trailing candidate who massively beats expectations, a serious bump in money and support that could overwhelm the rest of the field quite rapidly.\n\nTo answer the question in the headline of this piece, yes, Joe Biden can lose Iowa and New Hampshire and still win the Democratic presidential nomination. If he does so, of course, he will get his revenge on the Duopoly by weakening its grip of the nominating process.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s staff is talking up the idea that he can win the nomination even if he loses Iowa and New Hampshire, which nobody\u2019s done before.
