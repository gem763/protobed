Although he did not accuse the All Blacks directly of spying on them, Jones did lead into a light-hearted exchange with reporters.\n\n'I've got no idea, mate,' Jones responded when asked who had been filming England's training session.\n\nEddie Jones said the New Zealand media are 'fans with keyboards' ahead of their semi-final\n\nThe comment was made after the England coach said someone was filming their training\n\n'Mitch [New Zealand assistant John Mitchell] could have been one of them. He's got about 15 different disguises. Look, everyone knows what everyone else does. There are no surprises in the game any more.\n\n'There was definitely someone in the apartment block filming but it might have been a Japanese fan.'\n\nHe added: 'Someone has to ask questions, because the New Zealand media doesn't. You guys are just fans with keyboards, so someone's got to ask them some questions about what's going on.'\n\nWhen asked about what his friend and New Zealand coach, Steve Hansen, would make of it all, Jones said: 'He'll laugh, I'm sure he will.'\n\nJones did not accuse the All Blacks of spying and had a joke about it in his press conference\n\nNew Zealand coach Steve Hansen is yet to comment on the mystery cameraman in Chiba\n\nThe England head coach continued to see the funny side of the predicament, as he added: 'Yeah we've got someone there now mate.\n\nHe then backtracked and explained he hadn't spied on an opponent in years: 'I haven't done it since 2001. We used to do it.\n\n'You just don't need to do it any more because you see everything. You can watch everyone's training on YouTube or whatever. There's no value in doing it, absolutely zero.\n\n'We knew from the start. It doesn't change anything. We love it.'\n\nEngland are training in preparation for their World Cup semi-final against New Zealand\n\nThe England camp is not fazed by the incident and will continue as normal for Saturday\n\nLooking forward to Saturday's showdown with the defending World Cup champions, Jones insisted that all the pressure is on New Zealand to retain their title.\n\n'We don't have any pressure, no one thinks we can win. There's 120 million Japanese people out there whose second team are the All Blacks. There's no pressure on us. We just have to have a great week, relax and enjoy it.\n\n'They're looking for their third World Cup so that brings pressure.'\n\nJones claimed past experiences against the tournament favourites will help them improve on their previous meeting back in November 2018, where England narrowly lost 15-16.\n\n'We trialled some things in November against them and now we've got a few things we want to do a little better in this game. And now we've got the opportunity to do it.\n\n'I don't think they're vulnerable but the pressure is real. The busiest guy for them will be Gilbert Enoka, the mental skills coach. They've got to think about winning this three times. It's potentially the last game for their greatest ever coach and for their greatest ever captain [Kieran Read]. They will be talking about it the whole week. It's always much harder to defend the World Cup and they'll be thinking about that.\n\nJones is set to announce his starting team for the semi-final against New Zealand on Thursday.", "description": "England head coach Eddie Jones has admitted he does not know who was filming his squad's training session from an apartment block overlooking their field in Chiba.
