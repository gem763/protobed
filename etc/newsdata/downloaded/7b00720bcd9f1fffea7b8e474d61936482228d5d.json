In a way it has been co-evolution. With cats, it is way more recent. They come from a solitary ancestor that isn\u2019t a social species.\u201d\n\nThe African wildcat we domesticated our housecats from, Felis lybica, tends to lead a solitary life, mostly meeting when it is time to mate. \u201cCats are the only asocial animal that\u2019s been domesticated. Every other animal we\u2019ve domesticated has a social bond with other members of its species.\u201d\n\nGiven that cats are such an outlier among the animals we live with, it\u2019s no wonder that we might have been getting their signals wrong.\n\n\u201cBecause they are so self-determined and can take care of themselves, cats are becoming more and more popular,\u201d Hiestand says. \u201cBut whether the lifestyle suits them is another question. Humans are expecting cats to be like us and like dogs. And they aren\u2019t.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Bbc.Com Future Article"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
