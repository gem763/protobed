Crutch down to the kitchen, fill the rucksack, crutch back upstairs. It\u2019s like going camping in your own house. I\u2019m sure I could have put my foot down. But if I did so I was risking everything.\u201d\n\nAfter the surgery came the pain, excruciating in the early days. He kept telling himself that some people had to deal with this every day of their lives. All he had to do was survive six weeks. But there were times, in the middle of the night when he would lie awake aching for the loo and wondering what the least worst option would be.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wake my girlfriend up at 4am and say \u2018Can you empty my wee?\u2019 She would have done but she has work the next day. You find yourself doing silly things. Trying to hold it for the morning. Wondering if I can I wee in the pot and put it on the side. Will it spill? I can\u2019t carry anything whilst I crutch. Can I hold it with my teeth? Trying to plot how to get to the toilet in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nHe found himself looking forward to milestones much simpler than being able to lace up his boots and go outside and volley a football. \u201cIt just went to an appreciation of, \u2018I can\u2019t wait until I can walk\u2019. Or, \u2018I can\u2019t wait until I can sit on the toilet properly\u2019. I wasn\u2019t allowed to bend my leg so I when I was on the toilet I had to have a little footstool to rest my foot on. I had one as a kid to reach the toilet.\u201d\n\nAt the end of July, as he approached his holiday in Greece and then Los Angeles, there were concerns that the angle of bend his new knee could achieve was not on schedule. By then he was already running on a machine and doing some squatting but he needed that flexion to do all the things that once came as second nature \u2013 jumping, twisting, falling over and getting back up. That was when it was decided that his surgeon, Andy Williams, would put him under again and manipulate the leg. He plays the video on his phone and turns the volume up.\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s knee injuries explained\n\nHis leg is being pushed back beyond its usual angle of bend. \u201cThe scars are tearing,\u201d he says. \u201cThere you see it ping back to where it wants to go to. Even after I had this I was still way off it.\u201d What will truly bring it back will be the times in training or games when he falls on it and the knee is forced to give way again. It will be sweet agony for a couple of seconds but it will do the knee good. He imagines that moment: \u201cHave that! BOSH! A minute of pain and then I run it off.\u201d It will take around two years to regain the full range of motion.\n\nThen there was the World Cup. He watched it at home and enjoyed it. He was persuaded by mates to watch the group game against Belgium at Shoreditch Boxpark. It was a source of fascination to see the support so enraptured. He watched groups of friends meeting after work, rushing in time for kick-off, and the shared anxiety of being a fan. \u201cI said to my friends, \u2018Is this what it\u2019s like when I\u2019m playing and you lot watch the game down the pub?\u2019 They were like, \u2018Yeah, Chambo, this is why it\u2019s so weird for us. Because we know you\u2019re just an idiot and yet we sit with people at the pub worshipping you\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved every minute of it as a supporter. I felt that buzz that we all do as England fans. Plus of course, the lads, as well as the staff, are my mates. They are people who I\u2019ve grown very close to, and who I want to be successful. As players, we saw a lot in Gareth Southgate when he took over that perhaps took longer for everyone else to get about him. I love that he proved so many people wrong.\n\n\u201cAs a professional, as someone who would in all likelihood been playing some part, it was surreal. It\u2019s hard to explain the feeling without it sounding selfish or maybe even unpatriotic. But it isn\u2019t that. It\u2019s human nature I suppose \u2013 the \u2018it-could-have-been-me-feeling\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe was not a first XI pick when he missed out on Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup. This time, his performances for Liverpool had meant that he started both the crucial March friendlies against Holland and Italy. He believed he could have started for Southgate had he been fit, and stayed in the team.\n\n\u201cThat is where you have to fight the injury in ways that go beyond just the hard work and the boredom of rehab. You are missing out on great experiences and great moments \u2013 and these moments are taking place in front of your eyes. I suppose I did feel an element of grief at what the injury had taken away from me and that was worse at certain periods \u2013 especially the World Cup. A month earlier I\u2019d had to watch a Champions League final I would have played some part in and now I am watching England put in their best World Cup since 1990.\n\n\u201cThe further they went, the more I had to contend with that mixture of emotions. What do I feel in my bones? I loved seeing the boys play so well. I got carried away like everyone else. We were singing in the living room like I bet a lot of English families were. In the knockout stages I had proper goose-bumps before each game. I wanted them to get to the final and win it, although I know that would have come with something else too \u2013 a kind of mourning that I had missed out. I would have backed myself to deal with it positively though. I\u2019m that kind of person.\u201d\n\nHe watched the first game of Liverpool\u2019s season in an Irish bar on Sunset Boulevard at lunchtime, empty apart from him and his friends and a couple of fans who did not realise until the end of the game who it was under the baseball cap. As his rehabilitation continued he was conscious of managing expectations. A video taken of him on the indoor pitch at Melwood pinging a ball sweetly on the half-volley with his left foot was shot on Oct 21. He did not post it on Instagram until Nov 16, when he felt he was closer to training with the first team.\n\nHe had Christmas Day at home uninterrupted by training for the first time since he turned professional. The club had given him New Year off, which he spent with Perrie in Dubai. He was back there later that month with the first team and by Feb 12, when the squad went away again to Marbella, he joined in first team training for the first time. A little irritation to his knee meant that he was limited to rondos, the keep-ball exercises. It was supposed to be a private session but someone at the hotel caught the session on their phone and secretly he did not mind. He had looked sharp.\n\nThere are no half-measures when it comes to a player returning to full-contact first team training. A judgment has to be made as to whether he can either live with the intensity or not. Back at Melwood the week after Marbella he went in for the first time. He got the impression that a couple of his team-mates might be standing off him, and his reaction was to be as physical with them as he would be pre-injury. \u201cAfter that they feel it\u2019s fine to do the same to me. Because I am not pussyfooting around, then they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cHendo [Jordan Henderson] crunched me first time back. He didn\u2019t mean to but he gave me a good little tackle and clattered into me. I stumbled and then reacted, chasing the ball.\u201d He felt fine. There was another convention to be observed too. He had not yet played against the summer\u2019s new arrivals, and in his mind was the old anxiety of re-establishing himself among the pack.\n\n\u201cI wanted to look better than Naby Keita and Fabinho and [Xherdan] Shaqiri because they hadn\u2019t seen me. In my head I didn\u2019t care I had been out 11 months, there was the pressure of \u2018I need to show them\u2019. As soon as I was out on the pitch, when Trent or the full-back would get the ball I was making the runs I was making last year. Suddenly, I was in behind Matip and thinking, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here\u2019. But I was also thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve still got it, boys\u2019.\u201d", "description": "A year ago, a brutal injury left Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's dreams of playing in a Champions League final and a World Cup in tatters.
