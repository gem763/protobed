Here's how the event was advertised.\n\nCNN political analyst April Ryan is moderating a \"grassroots fundraiser event\" for 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, with tickets going as high as $500: https://t.co/yKlHmMssIh \u2014 Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) October 18, 2019\n\nHaving realized the conflict of interest she had placed herself in as a journalist, Ryan, who also works as a White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, is now backing out of the event. She explained on Twitter that the Buttigieg campaign did not make it clear that the venue was going to be a fundraiser. She looks forward to chatting with the South Bend, Indiana mayor at a \"more appropriate\" place.\n\nI agreed to interview Pete Buttigieg this weekend \u2013 the campaign was not clear that the venue would be a fundraiser. We\u2019ll be rescheduling the interview to a more appropriate time/place. Looking forward to asking him the tough questions the AURN audience wants answers to. \u2014 AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) October 18, 2019\n\nYet, critics were quick to note that Buttigieg also invited Ryan to be his guest at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner in September.", "description": ".10/19/2019 6:53:40AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/93/39964fba-b5b4-41bd-81b1-5e0932061af4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
