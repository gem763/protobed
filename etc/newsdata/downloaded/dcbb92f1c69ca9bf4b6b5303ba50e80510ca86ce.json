Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith a 0.7% yield and a eight-year payment history, investors probably think Gravita India looks like a reliable dividend stock. A 0.7% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Gravita India!\n\nNSEI:GRAVITA Historical Dividend Yield, October 22nd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Gravita India paid out 30% of its profit as dividends. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Of the free cash flow it generated last year, Gravita India paid out 46% as dividends, suggesting the dividend is affordable. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nIs Gravita India's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Gravita India has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Gravita India has net debt of 4.76 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the limit of most investors' comfort zones. Judicious use of debt can enhance shareholder returns, but also adds to the risk if something goes awry.\n\nNet interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 1.56 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Gravita India, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.\n\nWe update our data on Gravita India every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. The first recorded dividend for Gravita India, in the last decade, was eight years ago. It's good to see that Gravita India has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past eight-year period, the first annual payment was \u20b90.80 in 2011, compared to \u20b90.30 last year. The dividend has fallen 63% over that period.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Gravita India Limited (NSE:GRAVITA) from a dividend investor's perspective.
