The foldable drone was precisely the shot in the arm the industry needed to help make the technology more accessible for the masses.\n\nIn July, I paid a visit to the markets of Shenzhen, and it\u2019s clear that the design has had a profound impact on both the industry at large and the public perception of a drone\u2019s platonic ideal. DJI, meanwhile, has spent the last few years refining the line and building up a robust software offering.\n\nThe Mavic\u2019s design has also impacted DJI\u2019s other line, including, notably, the DJI Spark. In spite of superficial similarities, however, the selfie drone was never really considered part of the Mavic line. After all, the higher-end drones have long appealed to professionals, thanks to their ability to capture great footage in spite of a small footprint.\n\nAnnounced today, the Mavic Mini is the next logical step in that evolution. Like the Spark, the new drone is small enough to rest comfortably in the palm of your hand. Unlike the Spark, however, the sub-250 gram drone is designed to serve as a more serious imaging product, capable of shooting 2.7K video at 30fps or 1080p video at 60fps. For stills, it can do 12 megapixels courtesy of a 1/2.3-inch sensor, all mounted on a three-axis motorized gimbal.\n\nGranted, none of that can compete with the Hasselblad camera mounted on the latest Mavic Pro, but weight and pricing were both concerns here. And besides, the Pro is sticking around, so DJI will want to differentiate between tiers. There\u2019s another big difference here, as well \u2014 one that deserves to be highlighted for prospective buyers: there\u2019s no built-in obstacle avoidance. The requisite sensors were not included for the aforementioned reasons.\n\nWhile I can understand cutting corners here, that\u2019s a pretty big one for two key reasons. First, DJI is very much positioning this as a first-time drone for many. Second, the thing is tiny, meaning it\u2019s pretty easy to lose line of sight on the thing quickly.\n\nI will say that, as someone who has flown a few of these things, the Mini handles well and is quite easy to maneuver, in spite, or because, of its small size. Also, DJI offers up free demo software, so you can take a virtual drone for a spin before potentially sacrificing the real thing. Even so, the lack of the feature feels like a pretty glaring omission here.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s plenty to like here, including a battery that should get a solid 30 minutes of flight time on a charge, along with a slew of different shooting modes that will make you look like you know what you\u2019re doing with the press of a button.\n\nThe drone is up for pre-order today, priced at $399. There\u2019s also a $499 package that includes three batteries, an extra set of propellers, a carrying case, a charging hub that will also charge your phone and some beefy propeller cages.
