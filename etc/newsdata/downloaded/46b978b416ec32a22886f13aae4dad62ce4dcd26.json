Bird started the electric scooter craze in 2017, and spread to 120 cities in its first 14 months Lime launched in 2017 and has a current market valuation of $1.1 billion Uber got into the electric scooter market by acquiring Jump in 2018 Lyft launched its own brand of electric scooters in 2018 Ford purchased Spin for $40 million in 2017 Longtime scooter manufacturer Razor switched to electric scooters in 2018\n\nFor Yee, the Office of Emerging Technology could actually 'cut down on some of the recklessness that we saw in the past where companies just came in and operated and didn't bother asking the city whether or not they needed a permit.'\n\nIf the rest of the board approves of Yee's idea, the Office could be opened as soon as January 2020.\n\nIn one infamous 2018 episode, many San Francisco residents were upset to discover Lime's electric scooters had been designed to broadcast a loud warning message if someone stood on them or tried to move them before paying via a smartphone app.\n\nAaron Peskin, a San Francisco supervisor, said: 'I've gotten plenty of complaints from residents and shopkeepers who are p***ed off about the noise as well as the police state intimidation tactic.\n\n'It's kind of ironic they go and plop them in the middle of the sidewalk, and then these things start abusing people.'\n\nMany people have labelled the scooters, which do not need to be docked like some ride-sharing bike schemes, a menace and have questioned their legality.\n\nThe startup culture in the city is inextricably linked to the rapidly rising wealth levels in the city.\n\nEarlier this year, real estate agents predicted the city would become home to more than 10,000 new millionaires following IPOs from a number of the biggest tech companies with headquarters in the city.\n\nOne real estate developer estimated the value of a single-family home in the city could rise from an already astronomical $3 million to $5 million within five years.", "description": "San Francisco has been home to some major tech startups over the last decade but some residents are sick of the city being treated like an incubator of business experiments.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/23/19712694-0-image-a-7_1571090594751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
