These had to be spam, or bots gravitating toward any video with sufficient engagement, or an astroturfing campaign organized by Facebook\u2019s PR team. There could not possibly be this many people who love Mark Zuckerberg this much. Fast Company quickly published a piece that said the comments \u201csure look censored\u201d; minutes later, Facebook was on the record with several outlets denying any interference. When a post or video has an extraordinarily high volume of comments, Facebook automatically sifts through them using \u201cranking signals\u201d to filter out inauthentic or \u201clow-quality\u201d posts, a spokesperson told The Washington Post, but nothing was different for this particular stream.\n\nOnce the stream ended, it was easy to go back and find negative comments (\u201cLIZARD,\u201d \u201cLiar,\u201d \u201cOppressor of free will, free speech, and the king of manipulation of the weak-minded!\u201d), as well as a fair amount of total gibberish, but it was also fairly obvious that the thousands-upon-thousands of super-positive comments were not from bots. They were too specific and strange not to be real.\n\nDaphne Keller: Facebook restricts free speech by popular demand\n\nThe idea that some people might love Mark Zuckerberg should not have been entirely surprising\u2014Ashley Feinberg reported more than three years ago on \u201cthe bizarre world of unsolicited Mark Zuckerberg fan art,\u201d which is exactly what it sounds like (my favorite is the one where Zuckerberg is cast among the Avengers). There are quite a few Mark Zuckerberg fan clubs on Facebook, several of which have more than 1,000 members.\n\nClicking on 50 of the most enthusiastic live-stream comments at random led me to entirely authentic-looking profiles, and messaging people who posted them led me to a dozen entirely authentic conversations with avowed Mark Zuckerberg fans.\n\n\u201cI love my Facebook. I\u2019ve learned more about life than any school or college could teach me, thank you so much for creating Facebook, Mark, God bless,\u201d Zen Shabbar, a Jordanian man who now lives in California wrote on the side of the live-stream, appending four hearts and four prayer-hand emoji.\n\nWhen I wrote to him on Facebook Messenger, he said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d considers himself a fan of Zuckerberg\u2019s, as does his 23-year-old son. He typically makes a point of watching Zuckerberg\u2019s speeches, he told me, and the only other CEO he has ever felt similarly about was Steve Jobs. Though the past few years of privacy scandals have bothered him, he still feels that Zuckerberg is a \u201cremarkable young man\u201d who deserves his affection. \u201cI think he created something wonderful and brought people closer to each other,\u201d he added.\n\nAlmost everyone I spoke with agreed that they would use the word fan to describe their relationship to Zuckerberg, and many mentioned that they were endeared to him by the way his \u201chumble\u201d appearance contrasted with his otherworldly technological feats.", "description": "The Facebook CEO\u2019s recent speech was met with thousands of adoring, over-the-top comments.
