Photo: HBO\n\nThe 71st Emmy Awards air this Sunday, September 22. Which nominees will take home Emmy gold? And who should win, but won\u2019t? Lucky for your awards pool, Vulture staffers Jen Chaney, Matt Zoller Seitz, and Kathryn VanArendonk are here to break down their expert Emmy predictions for the major contenders in comedy, drama, limited series, and variety series.\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n\nPhoto: Steve Schofield/Amazon\n\n\u2022 Barry (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Fleabag (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 The Good Place (NBC)\n\n\u2022 The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Russian Doll (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Schitt\u2019s Creek (Pop)\n\n\u2022 Veep (HBO)\n\nMore often than not, Emmy voters tend to reward things they\u2019ve rewarded before, which is why Veep previously won in this category three years in a row. But with Veep ineligible last year, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel was able to swoop in and conquer. So will Maisel repeat? Or will Veep, in its last season, take home a fourth best-comedy Emmy?\n\nLet\u2019s start with what (probably) won\u2019t win. I can\u2019t imagine Schitt\u2019s Creek walking away with an Emmy because the competition is too stiff and the nomination felt like its own reward. The Good Place should have been in this category several years running, and that it took so long to be nominated makes me suspect it doesn\u2019t have a strong chance of winning either.\n\nThat leaves the five comedies that earned the most nominations overall. Russian Doll scooped up 13 nods, which speaks to the fact that it\u2019s well liked and respected. But it might be a little too offbeat and serialized to capture the votes it needs to win. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Barry won \u2014 its second season was even better than its first \u2014 but it would have to get past Mrs. Maisel, Veep, and Fleabag, and that\u2019s a high bar.\n\nIn any other year, I\u2019d say the voters would do what they always do and go with an established previous winner: either The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel or Veep, which would be a fitting way to bid the HBO comedy farewell. But Fleabag has buzz and cultural momentum behind it that the other two don\u2019t. Everyone loves it and they fell in love with it at exactly the right time, just as Emmy voting was getting underway. \u2014Jen Chaney\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Fleabag.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy\n\n\u2022 Anthony Anderson, Black-ish (ABC)\n\n\u2022 Don Cheadle, Black Monday (Showtime)\n\n\u2022 Ted Danson, The Good Place (NBC)\n\n\u2022 Michael Douglas, The Kominsky Method (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Bill Hader, Barry (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Eugene Levy, Schitt\u2019s Creek (Pop)\n\nI\u2019ll get right to the point: This one is going to Bill Hader for the second year in a row. No other performance in this category comes close to having all the different layers that Hader\u2019s does.\n\nBut let\u2019s run through them nonetheless. I feel the same way about Levy\u2019s nomination that I do about Schitt\u2019s Creek\u2019s for outstanding comedy: nice to be nominated, but probably won\u2019t win. This is Anthony Anderson\u2019s fifth nomination for Black-ish; he\u2019s never won and I don\u2019t see that changing this year. Cheadle is one of the high points of Black Monday, but some voters may not even be familiar with such an under-the-radar cable series. Danson is a treasure on The Good Place, but I think there\u2019s more support for Barry than NBC\u2019s existential comedy.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that Douglas could win for Kominsky Method, especially since he\u2019s playing a retired actor, a character that may appeal to people in the industry, especially older members of the Television Academy. But I can\u2019t get past the fact that Barry got 17 nominations, and the show couldn\u2019t be what it is without Hader. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Bill Hader for Barry.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy\n\n\u2022 Christina Applegate, Dead to Me (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Rachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Veep (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Natasha Lyonne, Russian Doll (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Catherine O\u2019Hara, Schitt\u2019s Creek (Pop)\n\n\u2022 Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag (Amazon)\n\nThis category is tough. I can imagine a scenario where any of these women might win. That being said, as terrific as both of them are, Applegate and O\u2019Hara seem like the easiest to rule out. Fleabag has a lot of momentum behind it, but I think it will get rewarded in other categories. Brosnahan could repeat, but I am skeptical of that happening either. Lyonne, who carries Russian Doll with a brash, ballsy, and personal performance that also feels like the completion of a comeback story that began with Orange Is the New Black, would be a fun underdog surprise.\n\nBut come on: It\u2019s got to be Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who has won an Emmy for every single season she\u2019s spent playing Selina Meyer on Veep. She\u2019s as close to a shoo-in as this category has. And having observed her work up close, I think she deserves to win one more time. Her ability to capture 1,000 different emotions in a single scene and to make every line of dialogue sound fresh, take after take, is awe-inspiring. In this season of Veep, she showed us what it looks like when a politician fully shifts to the dark side, and she did it fearlessly. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Julia Louis-Dreyfus for Veep.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy\n\n\u2022 Alan Arkin, The Kominsky Method (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Anthony Carrigan, Barry (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Tony Hale, Veep (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Stephen Root, Barry (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Tony Shalhoub, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Henry Winkler, Barry (HBO)\n\nThis category is dominated by actors from Barry, including Winkler, who won last year and is a justifiably beloved figure in the industry. He could very well win again \u2026 or all the Barry nominees could cancel each other out.\n\nThat would leave Arkin, Hale, and Shalhoub. Of those three, I think Hale and Shalhoub \u2014 the two Tonys \u2014 have the strongest chances. My hunch is that Shalhoub will ultimately prevail, but by a thin margin. Hale has been a magnificent foil to Louis-Dreyfus throughout Veep and has been nominated six times, winning twice. Shalhoub is also popular among the electorate, who nominated him for all eight seasons of Monk and gave him three Emmys for his role in it. Given the love for Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, I think he would have won last year if it hadn\u2019t felt so right to finally give an Emmy to Winkler. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Stephen Root for Barry. Winkler is great and Carrigan is the definition of a hoot as Noho Hank, but Root\u2019s performance went to deep and constantly surprising places this season. It\u2019s also Root\u2019s first Emmy nomination. This guy\u2019s been a great actor forever. Give him an award!\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Tony Shalhoub for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy\n\n\u2022 Alex Borstein, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Anna Chlumsky, Veep (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Sian Clifford, Fleabag (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Olivia Colman, Fleabag (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Betty Gilpin, GLOW (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Sarah Goldberg, Barry (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Marin Hinkle, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Kate McKinnon, Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n\nMcKinnon has won this award twice, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll snag it a third time this year. I\u2019m ruling out Hinkle because if anyone from Mrs. Maisel is going to win in this category, it\u2019s Borstein, who won last year. Gilpin is phenomenal on GLOW, but my guess is that GLOW doesn\u2019t have enough broad support among voters to push her over the edge. Goldberg did exceptional work on Barry this season, but I suspect that, like Gilpin, she\u2019ll be overshadowed by other nominees.\n\nClifford is superb on Fleabag as Claire, who got to crack through her hard shell this season and show a softer side (her delivery of the line \u201cI look like a pencil\u201d alone is Emmy-worthy). There\u2019s a chance she could win, but I suspect this will come down to Borstein, last year\u2019s winner, whose rat-a-tat patter on Maisel is something to behold; Chlumsky, who has been nominated for Veep on five previous occasions but still hasn\u2019t won; and Colman, who, in addition to being a spot-on, self-involved stepmother on Fleabag, is also coming off an Oscar win and delightful acceptance speech that endeared her even more to the public. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Sarah Goldberg for Barry. I don\u2019t think she gets nearly enough credit for making the narcissistic Sally such an empathetic but still very funny character.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Olivia Colman for Fleabag. And I won\u2019t be mad about it.\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Comedy Series\n\n\u2022 Barry, \u201cThe Audition,\u201d Alec Berg (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Barry, \u201cronny/lily,\u201d Bill Hader (HBO)\n\n\u2022 The Big Bang Theory, \u201cThe Stockholm Syndrome,\u201d Mark Cendrowski (CBS)\n\n\u2022 Fleabag, \u201cEpisode 2.1,\u201d Harry Bradbeer (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, \u201cAll Alone,\u201d Amy Sherman-Palladino (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, \u201cWe\u2019re Going to the Catskills!\u201d Daniel Palladino (Amazon)\n\nI\u2019ll just rule out The Big Bang Theory right now, since it\u2019s tough for any multi-camera series, even a very popular one in its final season, to win in this category. I\u2019ll also cross off the Barry episode \u201cThe Audition\u201d and Maisel\u2019s \u201cAll Alone\u201d because the other episodes from those series are more compelling nominees.\n\nThat leaves us with the nerve-jangling \u201cronny/lily\u201d from Barry, the glowing nostalgia of \u201cWe\u2019re Going to the Catskills!\u201d from Mrs. Maisel, and the all-forward-momentum of the first episode of Fleabag\u2019s second season. I think it\u2019s going to be a really tight race between these three, but I suspect the audacious action sequences of \u201cronny/lilly\u201d will win the day. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 This is a close call, but I lean toward Fleabag because it\u2019s so tightly constructed and directed by Bradbeer as if he\u2019s visually channeling Waller-Bridge\u2019s voice.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 \u201cronny/lily,\u201d as directed by Hader for Barry.\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Comedy Series\n\n\u2022 Barry, \u201cronny/lily,\u201d Alec Berg and Bill Hader (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Fleabag, \u201cEpisode 2.1,\u201d Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 The Good Place, \u201cJanet(s),\u201d Josh Siegal and Dylan Morgan (NBC)\n\n\u2022 PEN15, \u201cAnna Ishii-Peters,\u201d Maya Erskine, Anna Konkle, and Stacy Osei-Kuffour (Hulu)\n\n\u2022 Russian Doll, \u201cNothing in This World Is Easy,\u201d Leslye Headland, Natasha Lyonne, Amy Poehler (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Russian Doll, \u201cA Warm Body,\u201d Allison Silverman (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Veep, \u201cVeep,\u201d David Mandel (HBO)\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be fun if Erskine, Konkle, and Osei-Kuffour won for PEN15? It definitely would be, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t see that happening. I don\u2019t see it happening for Russian Doll or The Good Place either, despite the strength of the writing on both shows. (Side note: It\u2019s bizarre that \u201cJanet(s)\u201d was nominated for writing but D\u2019Arcy Carden, the woman who played Janet and every other character in that episode, got bupkis.)\n\nThe Barry episode \u201cronny/lily\u201d stands out more for its direction than its writing, at least in my view. That\u2019s why I see this as a two-script race between the first episode of Fleabag season two and the final episode of Veep. On the one hand, I can imagine many voters wanting to honor Waller-Bridge since Fleabag is predicated on the uniqueness of her voice. On the other, the Veep finale is extremely well written and speaks to the insanity of our political moment by coming at it sideways from a parallel universe. It\u2019s tragedy as comedy. Plus, Veep has only one writing Emmy to its credit and that seems wrong. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 I declare this one a tie and give a prize to both Fleabag\u2019s Waller-Bridge and Veep\u2019s Mandel. Am I allowed to do that? Who cares? Selina Meyer proved there are no rules anymore.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Veep.\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\n\u2022 Better Call Saul (AMC)\n\n\u2022 Bodyguard (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Killing Eve (BBC America)\n\n\u2022 Ozark (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Pose (FX)\n\n\u2022 Succession (HBO)\n\n\u2022 This Is Us (NBC)\n\nI could write a couple of paragraphs that engage in all kinds of pseudo-statistical Emmy analysis, but let\u2019s be honest: Game of Thrones is going to win. It doesn\u2019t matter that some elements of the final season weren\u2019t as satisfying as they could have been, or that some fans started a petition asking for a redo (as if premium-cable dramas should be treated like lousy putts in miniature golf). On every scale \u2014 popularity, narrative scope, production values \u2014 Game of Thrones was the biggest show in recent memory. Emmy voters will definitely give it one more trophy for best drama as it heads into the sunset. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Better Call Saul. It continues to be quietly and consistently excellent, to a degree that is unprecedented for a spinoff prequel to a respected series like Breaking Bad. Maybe it will get an Emmy in this category someday. But it\u2019s not going to happen on Sunday.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Game of Thrones.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama\n\n\u2022 Jason Bateman, Ozark (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Sterling K. Brown, This Is Us (NBC)\n\n\u2022 Kit Harington, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Bob Odenkirk, Better Call Saul (AMC)\n\n\u2022 Billy Porter, Pose (FX)\n\n\u2022 Milo Ventimiglia, This Is Us (NBC)\n\nIf Game of Thrones is really on a roll, there\u2019s a chance that Harington could win here. But I don\u2019t expect that to happen, nor do I expect either Brown or Ventimiglia from This Is Us to triumph. And Odenkirk, like the show in which he stars, seems destined to get nominated every year and never win.\n\nI can\u2019t completely put a line through Jason Bateman\u2019s name because voters seem to really like Ozark, which suggests he could be a surprise winner. But if I had to put money on this \u2014 which, to be clear, I don\u2019t and I\u2019m not \u2014 I would put it on Billy Porter, who has been doing a ton of press and promotion to make sure his terrific performance as Pray Tell isn\u2019t forgotten. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Billy Porter for Pose. No one else could play that role but him. Plus, I want to hear his acceptance speech.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Drama\n\n\u2022 Christina Applegate, Dead to Me (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Emilia Clarke, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Jodie Comer, Killing Eve (BBC America)\n\n\u2022 Viola Davis, How to Get Away With Murder (ABC)\n\n\u2022 Laura Linney, Ozark (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Mandy Moore, This Is Us (NBC)\n\n\u2022 Sandra Oh, Killing Eve (BBC America)\n\n\u2022 Robin Wright, House of Cards (Netflix)\n\nMy sense is that neither Davis, who won in this category in 2015, nor Wright, who has been nominated every year of House of Cards\u2019 existence without a win, will take home this Emmy on Sunday night. How to Get Away With Murder doesn\u2019t have a lot of traction behind it, and I\u2019m guessing that a lot of voters would rather put House of Cards behind them, despite Wright\u2019s tenacious performance. As for Moore, her work hasn\u2019t attracted the heft or buzz that the other nominees\u2019 performances have.\n\nLike Bateman, Linney could be a surprise winner for Ozark. But I\u2019m inclined to think that the three women who played three of the more determined, ruthless women on television \u2014 Clarke, Oh, and Comer \u2014 are at the top of the pack. Clarke could get dinged by the fact that Daenerys\u2019s story line felt a bit rushed in GOT\u2019s finale season. Oh seems like the obvious pick since she won last year. But my eyes are on Comer, who is Oh\u2019s skillfully manipulative dance partner on Killing Eve and wasn\u2019t even nominated last year. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Jodie Comer for Killing Eve, whose portrayal of Villanelle is as unpredictable as it is unsettling.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama\n\n\u2022 Alfie Allen, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Jonathan Banks, Better Call Saul (AMC)\n\n\u2022 Nikolaj Coster-Waldeau, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Peter Dinklage, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Giancarlo Esposito, Better Call Saul (AMC)\n\n\u2022 Michael Kelly, House of Cards (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Chris Sullivan, This Is Us (NBC)\n\nThis is Dinklage\u2019s race to lose. He\u2019s won the Emmy in this category three times before and, whatever you may think of Game of Thrones, he\u2019s been consistently excellent as Tyrion. His performance was one of the strongest parts of the show\u2019s finale and absolutely central to the way the story was resolved. Everyone else in this category is very good. But Dinklage\u2019s work stands out as important and vital in a way that the others don\u2019t quite. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Peter Dinklage for Game of Thrones.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama\n\n\u2022 Gwendoline Christie, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Julia Garner, Ozark (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Lena Headey, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Fiona Shaw, Killing Eve (BBC America)\n\n\u2022 Sophie Turner, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Maisie Williams, Game of Thrones (HBO)\n\nThe odds are slim that Shaw will win for Killing Eve \u2014 at least that\u2019s the consensus over at Gold Derby \u2014 which means this will either go to Garner or one of the ladies from Game of Thrones. With four nominees from Westeros, there\u2019s a real chance they\u2019ll split the vote. In any other season, I would have said Headey looks poised to win, but the writers did so little with Cersei in the final GOT season that she wasn\u2019t provided with much of a showcase. Christie got to do some of the more touching, emotional work of the four nominees here, and I can see her winning (and also imagine the internet celebrating that win).\n\nBut there is something to that splitting-of-the-vote possibility, which is why my guess is that Garner, who\u2019s proven her range as an actor not only on Ozark but The Americans and Dirty John, will prevail. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Gwendoline Christie for Game of Thrones, who radiated both joy and sorrow during the final season.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Julia Garner for Ozark.\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Drama Series\n\n\u2022 Game of Thrones, \u201cThe Iron Throne,\u201d David Benioff and D. B. Weiss (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Game of Thrones, \u201cThe Last of the Starks,\u201d David Nutter (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Game of Thrones, \u201cThe Long Night,\u201d Miguel Sapochnik (HBO)\n\n\u2022 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, \u201cHolly,\u201d Daina Reid (Hulu)\n\n\u2022 Killing Eve, \u201cDesperate Times,\u201d Lisa Br\u00fclhmann (BBC)\n\n\u2022 Ozark, \u201cReparations,\u201d Jason Bateman (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Succession, \u201cCelebration,\u201d Adam McKay (HBO)\n\nGiven the scale and ambition of Game of Thrones, plus this being its last season, I believe it will win here. The question is: Which episode? \u201cThe Iron Throne\u201d was a finale peppered with the kind of visual flourishes \u2014 remember Dany and her dragon wings? \u2014 that seem designed to catch Emmy voters\u2019 attention. \u201cThe Long Night,\u201d with its complex battle sequences, could win, too, although it would be more than a little comical to reward an episode that many viewers complained they could not fully see.\n\nBut of the three Game of Thrones episodes nominated, those are the two truly significant ones. For a while I believed \u201cThe Long Night\u201d would win, but the more I think about it, the more I think voters will want to reward Benioff and Weiss for their direction. Either way: Internet\u2019s so gonna internet when this category is announced! \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Game of Thrones for \u201cThe Iron Throne.\u201d Purely on a scene-by-scene basis, \u201cThe Iron Throne\u201d was well directed and probably deserves the award? [Ducks.]\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Drama Series\n\n\u2022 Better Call Saul, \u201cWinner,\u201d Peter Gould and Thomas Schnauz (AMC)\n\n\u2022 Bodyguard, \u201cEpisode 1,\u201d Jed Mercurio (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Game of Thrones, \u201cThe Iron Throne,\u201d David Benioff and D.

But the script for the Game of Thrones finale was definitely not its strongest asset, which opens the door a little bit. That opening could provide the chance to reward a series that has recently become the most talked-about show on television, at least based on Twitter memes and Vulture\u2019s Slack channel.\n\nThat would be Succession, and its wry, dark season-one finale, written by Armstrong. Sometimes the winners in this category go to shows that were good for a very long time but never quite broke through the Outstanding Drama ceiling \u2014 see last year\u2019s winner, The Americans, or Friday Night Lights a few years back. This time, Emmy voters may actually try to look to the future. \u2014JC\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 \u201cWinner,\u201d the season finale of Better Call Saul. First of all, it\u2019s called \u201cWinner,\u201d so it\u2019s pretty much telling you what it is. Second, that episode is filled with sharp writing, including the brilliantly deceptive speech that Jimmy makes during his bar hearing. Third, it ends with a phrase that is also an origin story: \u201cS\u2019all good, man.\u201d\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Succession and \u201cNobody Is Ever Missing.\u201d\n\nOutstanding Limited Series\n\nPhoto: Michael Parmelee/FX\n\n\u2022 Chernobyl (HBO)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Escape at Dannemora (Showtime)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Fosse/Verdon (FX)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Sharp Objects (HBO)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 When They See Us (Netflix)\n\nThis was an extraordinary year for limited series, maybe one of the strongest in memory. HBO\u2019s Chernobyl was perhaps the biggest surprise of the year, and not merely because it represented such a profound about-face for creator and writer Craig Mazin, previously known for (and typecast by) the Hangover movies. It drew viewers back, week after week, to a story of manmade disaster and bureaucratic ineptitude, complete with revolting images of people dying of radiation burns and poisoning. It has to be considered the dark horse candidate.\n\nSharp Objects was a master class in elliptical storytelling from its sole director, Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, but the grimness of the subject matter (as relentless as Chernobyl, but without the saving grace of spectacle) might work against it, along with Vall\u00e9e\u2019s role in seemingly taking away season two of Big Little Lies from its auteur director, Andrea Arnold. Showtime\u2019s Escape at Dannemora was also a surprise coming from director Ben Stiller, not the person you might expect to tell the true-life story of a prison break masterminded by two inmates (Paul Dano and Benicio Del Toro) in a sexual relationship with a prison worker (Patricia Arquette).\n\nFX\u2019s Fosse/Verdon was catnip for fans of Broadway, musical theater, and showbiz history; the murderer\u2019s row of behind-the-scenes producing talent amplified the must-see factor, even more so than the spot-on casting in every major role. But despite strong feminist underpinnings, its early installments played like another entry in the Toxic Male Genius genre, and it might suffer from being nearly impenetrable if you don\u2019t know the main players. Still, it grows in power once you realize that it isn\u2019t going to do the things you expect, and its reverence for the traditions of show business might put it over the top \u2014 Emmy voters love shows that reassure them they\u2019re doing exciting, important work.\n\nThe most altogether brilliant achievement in this category is the Central Park Five drama When They See Us, directed and co-written by Ava DuVernay with a precision, visual sophistication, and breadth of vision that marked it as a huge step up from her already impressive filmography of works about or related to the experience of African-Americans in the criminal-justice system. Both structurally and tonally audacious, this was one for the ages, maybe the closest thing to an epic neorealist drama that American television has yet produced. \u2014Matt Zoller Seitz\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 When They See Us.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Fosse/Verdon.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series\n\n\u2022 Mahershala Ali, True Detective (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Benicio Del Toro, Escape at Dannemora (Showtime)\n\n\u2022 Hugh Grant, A Very English Scandal (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Jared Harris, Chernobyl (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Jharrel Jerome, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\nThe front-runners in this category are Mahershala Ali of True Detective, who was awe-inspiring as a police detective struggling with memory across three time periods, and Hugh Grant playing parliamentary leader Jeremy Thorpe in A Very English Scandal, an outwardly cheerful yet ruthless character trying to neutralize threats from a much younger lover (Ben Whishaw). Ali won two Oscars back-to-back, which is a hard prestige lure to resist on top of his excellence, while Grant recently has come back into vogue as a character actor and can be relied upon to give a charming, thoroughly English acceptance speech.\n\nBenicio Del Toro was thrilling as a tough and conniving inmate in Showtime\u2019s Escape at Dannemora, but it\u2019s questionable whether he showed us anything new or different in the part. Sam Rockwell\u2019s work as Bob Fosse in FX\u2019s Fosse/Verdon deserved more credit than it got \u2014 he was overshadowed by Williams\u2019s fresh and brilliant work as Gwen Verdon \u2014 and the actor was further hampered by the fact that he wasn\u2019t Roy Scheider, who had played a far more appealing incarnation of the character in Fosse\u2019s 1979 autobiographical musical fantasy All That Jazz.\n\nThe two most impressive performers in this category are the subtlest. Jared Harris\u2019s performance as safety advocate Valery Legasov in HBO\u2019s Chernobyl was a heartbreaking portrait of a scientist and policy expert being ignored and silenced for the sake of politics; he infused the role with his customary gift for drying out melodrama and tragedy to make it more affecting.\n\nJharrel Jerome, who excelled as teenage Kevin in Moonlight, was the only actor in Ava DuVernay\u2019s When They See Us to play both the teenage and adult incarnations of his character, Korey Wise. The lighting, makeup, and hairstyling helped, but it was mostly Jerome\u2019s masterful body language that sold the character\u2019s evolution \u2014 the sense that Wise was so transformed by his unjust experience that the emotional weight he carried had turned physical. It\u2019s as altogether impressive a performance as any of the nominees, coming from an actor who\u2019s still at the beginning of what ought to be a long career. \u2014MZS\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Jharrel Jerome for When They See Us.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Jared Harris for Chernobyl.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series\n\n\u2022 Amy Adams, Sharp Objects (HBO)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Patricia Arquette, Escape at Dannemora (Showtime)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Aunjanue Ellis, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Joey King, The Act (Hulu)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Niecy Nash, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Michelle Williams, Fosse/Verdon (FX)\n\nIn any other year, Amy Adams\u2019s work as the traumatized, homeward bound investigative journalist in Sharp Objects would feel like a sure thing. Consistently outstanding in a variety of movie roles since 2005\u2019s Junebug, she reached a new peak of subtlety as Camille Preaker, seeming to turn the character\u2019s younger incarnation (played Sophia Lillis of the It films) and director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\u2019s impressionistic flash cuts into scene partners, even though she was acting against nothing and no one when her pieces of the puzzle were filmed.\n\nBut then Michelle Williams came along playing Gwen Verdon in Fosse/Verdon. She has the transformative, quasi-Method intensity that awards voters love to reward whenever the practitioner is a macho guy like Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, Leonardo DiCaprio, or, back in the day, Robert De Niro. But it\u2019s a deeply human, accessible performance that never feels like a mere impression. And the story line of the miniseries \u2014 an accomplished female performer\u2019s superb work is overshadowed by the death of her more famous male partner \u2014 unintentionally rhymes with Williams\u2019s own journey through grief that it seems inconceivable that she won\u2019t win this year.\n\nIn comparison, all of the other nominated performers are going to seem like footnotes, which is a shame considering the strength and skill displayed by Aunjanue Ellis and Niecy Nash in When They See Us, and the daring, chameleonic work of Joey King in The Act and Patricia Arquette in Escape at Dannemora. (Arquette, another national treasure, has a better shot at supporting actress in this category, for playing King\u2019s unhinged mother in The Act.) \u2014MZS\n\nThe Emmy should (and will) go to \u2026 Michelle Williams for Fosse/Verdon.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series\n\n\u2022 Patricia Arquette, The Act (Hulu)\n\n\u2022 Marsha Stephanie Blake, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Patricia Clarkson, Sharp Objects (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Vera Farmiga, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Emily Watson, Chernobyl (HBO)\n\nBetween her performance in Escape at Dannemora and her ominous and oppressive turn in Hulu\u2019s The Act, it\u2019s been a peak year for Patricia Arquette. She gave a committed, intense, yet refreshingly non-condescending performance in The Act, playing a drug-addicted mom inflicting Munchausen syndrome by proxy on her daughter (Joey King), inhabiting the character so completely that if you\u2019d never seen Arquette in anything else, you might think she was a brilliant local who\u2019d won the part in an open call.\n\nBut it\u2019s doubtful that anyone can beat Patricia Clarkson, who played a different, even more smothering mother in HBO\u2019s Sharp Objects. Although a less obviously transformational performance than Arquette\u2019s, Clarkson is a lot more crowd-pleasing, bringing an almost Tennessee Williams\u2013like edge of caustic, undermining wit to her character, and injecting a welcome element of borderline camp into an otherwise funereal story. In comparison, the other four outstanding performances in this category \u2014 Vera Farmiga as the destructive prosecutor and Marsha Stephanie Blake as a crusading mother in When They See Us; Margaret Qualley\u2019s wide-eyed young Ann Reinking in Fosse/Verdon; Emily Watson as the intrepid Ulana Khomyuk in Chernobyl \u2014 don\u2019t stand a chance. \u2014MZS\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Patricia Arquette for The Act.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Patricia Clarkson for Sharp Objects.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series\n\n\u2022 Asante Blackk, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Paul Dano, Escape at Dannemora (Showtime)\n\n\u2022 John Leguizamo, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\n\u2022 Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Chernobyl (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Ben Whishaw, A Very English Scandal (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Michael K. Williams, When They See Us (Netflix)\n\nWhile Michael K. Williams is heartbreaking in When They See Us, John Leguizamo has a cleaner dramatic arc as Raymond Santana Sr., the father of another of the imprisoned teens. Not only is he at the center of one of the most daringly directed sequences \u2014 an elegant passage-of-time montage, built around a series of phone calls \u2014 he captures the predicament of a man placed in an emotionally impossible position, having remarried and started a new family while his son was incarcerated, and trying to play peacemaker in their arguments without taking sides. Leguizamo deserves to win an Emmy for his work here. Not only is the performance itself nearly immaculate, it sums up three decades\u2019 worth of his memorable performances as authentic New York characters, some boldly stylized, others achingly real.\n\nIn comparison, Paul Dano in Escape at Dannemora, Ben Whishaw in A Very English Scandal, and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd in Chernobyl don\u2019t register quite as strongly. But Skarsg\u00e5rd, a beloved and consistently excellent character actor, feels like the front-runner here anyway, for his performance as a Soviet official who goes from interfering with attempts to deal with the nuclear disaster to endorsing those same impulses.\n\nAsante Blackk, a first-time actor cast as one of the railroaded teens in When They See Us, deserves special mention for the delicacy and transparency of his acting, as well as for the iconic magnetism of his face. He probably won\u2019t win because almost nobody does their first time out, and especially not when they\u2019re as young as Blackk is. But he\u2019s so remarkable that we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if lightning strikes. \u2014MZS\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 John Leguizamo for When They See Us.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd for Chernobyl.\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Limited Series\n\n\u2022 A Very English Scandal, Stephen Frears (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Chernobyl, Johan Renck (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Escape at Dannemora, Ben Stiller (Showtime)\n\n\u2022 Fosse/Verdon, Jessica Yu, \u201cGlory\u201d (FX)\n\n\u2022 Fosse/Verdon, Thomas Kail, \u201cWho\u2019s Got the Pain\u201d (FX)\n\n\u2022 When They See Us, Ava DuVernay (Netflix)\n\nThomas Kail and Jessica Yu both directed strong episodes of Fosse/Verdon: The second episode, which flashed back to the beginning of the title characters\u2019 relationship, and the fourth, which contrasted Fosse\u2019s career success directing Pippin! and Liza With a Z with Gwen Verdon\u2019s struggle acting in the short-lived dramatic play Children! Children! Yet neither were as moving and nearly perfect as the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth episodes (three of which were also directed by Kail), so it\u2019s puzzling why these two were singled out.\n\nBen Stiller\u2019s direction of the true-life prison drama Escape at Dannemora was a startling departure from everything he\u2019s done in the past \u2014 it was even composed in CinemaScope dimensions that emphasized the oppressive architecture of the prison \u2014 but it might\u2019ve been better as a self-contained film than as a miniseries. Stephen Frears, a sly veteran with amazing range, made A Very English Scandal brisk and understated, which enhanced both the comedy and the tragedy, but the project seems overshadowed by the grandioseness of other titles in this category \u2014 namely the immense, terrifying, often blackly comedic Chernobyl. The HBO miniseries\u2019 sole director, Johan Renck, feels like the front-runner, unless the voters\u2019 tendency to reward projects about show business shifts things in Fosse/Verdon\u2019s direction.\n\nBut by all rights, this should be When They See Us director Ava DuVernay\u2019s year. Equally impressive for its structure, its control of tone, its deployment of period details, the breadth of its research, and the depth of its feeling, it\u2019s one of the finest TV productions to debut in the streaming era. \u2014MZS\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Ava DuVernay for When They See Us.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Johan Renck for Chernobyl.\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Limited Series\n\n\u2022 A Very English Scandal, Russell T. Davies (Amazon)\n\n\u2022 Chernobyl, Craig Mazin (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Escape at Dannemora, \u201cEpisode 6,\u201d Brett Johnson, Michael Tolkin, and Jerry Stahl (Showtime)\n\n\u2022 Escape at Dannemora, \u201cEpisode 7,\u201d Brett Johnson and Michael Tolkin (Showtime)\n\n\u2022 Fosse/Verdon, \u201cProvidence,\u201d Steven Levinson and Joel Fields (FX)\n\n\u2022 When They See Us, \u201cPart Four,\u201d Ava DuVernay and Michael Starrbury (Netflix)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the studious grit of Escape at Dannemora or the incisive drollness of A Very English Scandal besting the other nominees in this category. Craig Mazin seems likely to take it for Chernobyl, because it\u2019s a substantial achievement in its own right, blending historical sweep, journalistic muckraking, and gallows humor, and because it\u2019s the kind of career about-face that voters love to single out. My heart is with Ava DuVernay and Michael Starrbury\u2019s script for the fourth episode of When They See Us, the centerpiece of which is a 45-minute tour de force about the experience of Korey Wise in Rikers Island penitentiary. It boasts expressionist sequences reminiscent of the final half-hour of The Last Temptation of Christ, and wraps up with a series of genuinely cathartic moments. \u2014MZS\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Ava DuVernay and Michael Starrbury for When They See Us.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Craig Mazin for Chernobyl.\n\nOutstanding Variety Talk Series\n\nPhoto: Scott Kowalchyk/CBS\n\n\u2022 The Daily Show With Trevor Noah (Comedy Central)\n\n\u2022 Full Frontal With Samantha Bee (TBS)\n\n\u2022 Jimmy Kimmel Live! (ABC)\n\n\u2022 Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO)\n\n\u2022 The Late Late Show With James Corden (CBS)\n\n\u2022 The Late Show With Stephen Colbert (CBS)\n\nWhile I would love it if this award went to Full Frontal, I\u2019m afraid Samantha Bee\u2019s incisive commentary hasn\u2019t reached a level of widespread cultural buzz to make it an obvious choice for Emmy voters. Trevor Noah\u2019s Daily Show has a slightly better chance: He\u2019s gotten more recognition for slowly but surely remaking that show into a new thing. Like Full Frontal, though, it doesn\u2019t feel like that narrative has been quite visible enough for Noah to break through.\n\nIn the short history of this category, it has been remarkably stable. First it was Jon Stewart\u2019s Daily Show in 2015, then Last Week Tonight every year since. I\u2019m not sure that any of the other shows have enough momentum to topple John Oliver. But if the award were to go to another nominee, it might be the year for Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show. After a rocky introduction and early months spent getting his footing, Colbert has been ascendant in late night this year. He\u2019s gotten credit for embracing politics, often more directly and sharply than the other big late-night programs, and Colbert has also distinguished himself as both an interviewer and a monologist. It still feels like Last Week Tonight\u2019s award to lose, but from a momentum standpoint it might be time to look toward The Late Show. \u2014Kathryn VanArendonk\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Last Week Tonight.\n\nOutstanding Variety Sketch Series\n\n\u2022 At Home With Amy Sedaris (truTV)\n\n\u2022 Documentary Now!

(Showtime)\n\nLook, Saturday Night Live is probably going to win this. There is a slight chance it goes to Who Is America? instead, because Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s Showtime series had a couple big breakout moments and people seem to really love it when that guy does pranks by dressing up and doing a silly voice. But SNL has become the default choice in this category, winning the past two years running, and the show\u2019s most recent season was plenty strong enough to validate that decision once again.\n\nFor my money, though, the single best variety sketch series of the year was Documentary Now! Hands down, no question, chisel it in stone, make a fake Sondheim musical about it and then make a fake D.A. Pennebaker documentary about the fake musical. The details are what tip Documentary Now! over the edge from funny into brilliant. The costumes and the fonts and the camera angles and the absolutely obsessive re-creations of editing rhythms and character tics, all of it is meticulous and thoughtful and great. Saturday Night Live will probably win, but Co-op has my heart. \u2014KVA\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Documentary Now!\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Saturday Night Live.\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Variety Series\n\n\u2022 Documentary Now! (IFC)\n\n\u2022 Full Frontal With Samantha Bee (TBS)\n\n\u2022 Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO)\n\n\u2022 Late Night With Seth Meyers (NBC)\n\n\u2022 The Late Show With Stephen Colbert (CBS)\n\n\u2022 Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n\nGiving this Emmy to Last Week Tonight for the fourth consecutive year feels both safe and correct. It is an intensely writerly show, which is not to say that other late-night shows don\u2019t involve a great deal of writing, too. But Last Week Tonight is like the late-night version of a very funny term paper, written by the kids in your class who actually started doing research the moment they got the assignment rather than spending a few hours in the library the night before it was due. The writing is right up top. It is the thing you celebrate.\n\nYet, in the interest of shaking things up and of rewarding other truly great work, this award should go to Late Night With Seth Meyers, a show that has been consistently crushing its scripted segments. Late Night has been explicit about highlighting its writers as well, especially in its \u201cJokes Seth Can\u2019t Tell\u201d bit, where women from the Late Night writers\u2019 room come out and perform all the jokes Meyers could never do. An award for Late Night here wouldn\u2019t just be about celebrating the material itself, although it would and should do that. It\u2019d be a way for the Emmys to celebrate positive behind-the-scenes shifts in late-night comedy, and to reward a show that owns its writing and its writers. \u2014KVA\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Late Night With Seth Meyers.\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Last Week Tonight.\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Variety Series\n\n\u2022 Documentary Now!, \u201cWaiting for the Artist,\u201d Alex Buono and Rhys Thomas (IFC)\n\n\u2022 Drunk History, \u201cAre You Afraid of the Drunk?\u201d Derek Waters (Comedy Central)\n\n\u2022 Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, \u201cPsychics,\u201d Paul Pennolino (HBO)\n\n\u2022 The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, \u201cLive Midterm Election Show,\u201d Jim Hoskinson\n\n\u2022 Saturday Night Live, \u201cHost: Adam Sandler,\u201d Don Roy King\n\n\u2022 Who Is America?, \u201cEpisode 102,\u201d Sacha Baron Cohen, Nathan Fielder, Daniel Gray Longino, and Dan Mazer\n\nEverything I said about the variety sketch series category goes double here. Saturday Night Live tends to win this category \u2014 it\u2019s won seven of the last nine years \u2014 and because SNL is part of the Zeitgeist in a much more broadly visible way than any other show in this category, it feels like a very safe bet. The nominated SNL episode was the one hosted by Adam Sandler, which included several great sketches and an especially poignant moment as Sandler sang a song in memory of Chris Farley. It\u2019s gonna be a hard one to beat.\n\nBut Documentary Now! had some of the best directing anywhere on TV last year. The episode nominated is \u201cWaiting for the Artist,\u201d the show\u2019s Marina Abramovic spoof, and it exemplifies the best of what Documentary Now! can be: goofy and stupid and intellectual and subtle all at one. (Did I mention goofy and stupid?) None of it would work without Rhys Thomas and Alexander Buono\u2019s direction, which is usually so straight-faced that it actively resists the show\u2019s spoofiness. It\u2019s amazing, and I\u2019m thrilled it was recognized with a nomination even though I doubt it will win. \u2014KVA\n\nThe Emmy should go to \u2026 Documentary Now!\n\nBut the Emmy will go to \u2026 Saturday Night Live.", "description": "Who will win at the 2019 Emmy Awards?
