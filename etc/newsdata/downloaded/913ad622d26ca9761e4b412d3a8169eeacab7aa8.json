The Sun Devils became ranked after beating the Spartans a year ago, but went on to lose their next two games. Colorado is trying to bounce back from a 23-20 overtime loss to Air Force at home.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nArizona State\u2019s secondary vs. Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault. While their offense is still trying to find a footing, the Sun Devils have been solid on defense. Arizona State shut down Michigan State last week and has held its first three opponents to a combined 21 points. The Sun Devils will face perhaps their toughest test to date in trying to corral Shenault. The junior is one of the nation\u2019s top receivers and had a huge game in Colorado\u2019s 28-21 win against Arizona State, finishing with 13 catches for 127 yards while scoring four combined touchdowns.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nColorado: DE Mustafa Johnson. A 6-foot-2, 290-pound junior, Johnson had 8 \u00bd sacks last season and has three through the first three games. Arizona State has a young offensive line and has had trouble protecting the quarterback, so Johnson could wreak havoc.\n\nArizona State: RB Eno Benjamin. The junior is known for his running ability, but has become just as big a threat catching passes out of the backfield. Benjamin is fifth in the FBS with 137 yards receiving and has scored two touchdowns through the air. He needs seven yards rushing against Colorado to reach 2,000 for his career.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nArizona State has scored at least 10 points in 122 straight games, four shy of the FBS modern-era record. \u2026 Colorado has outscored opponents 51-24 in the fourth quarter. \u2026 Jayden Daniels can become the fourth Arizona State QB since 1970 to win his first four starts with a win on Saturday. \u2026 The Buffaloes are sixth nationally in kickoff returns at 34.3 yards per return. \u2026 The Sun Devils are one of four teams to not allow any first-half points this season with Memphis, Wisconsin and Baylor. \u2026 Colorado is second nationally with a turnover margin of plus-2.33.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Colorado (2-1) at No. 24 Arizona State (3-0), Saturday at 10 p.m. EDT (Pac-12 Network).", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/sacramento_st_arizona_st_football_78555_c0-150-3600-2248_s1770x1032.jpg?831f1c713c800600b4988e33b8c39c4d6a4cbcd9", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
