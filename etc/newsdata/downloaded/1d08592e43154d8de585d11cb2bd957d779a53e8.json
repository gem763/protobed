(Shamil Zhumatov / Reuters)\n\nOn Russia, Iran, the U.S., decency, wine, a marvelous photo, and more\n\nFor years now, some of us have said, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing he\u2019s still alive.\u201d We\u2019re talking about Alexei Navalny, the leader of the Russian opposition. (The previous such leader, Boris Nemtsov, was murdered within sight of the Kremlin in 2015.) Over and over, Navalny has been attacked \u2014 physically, that is. In the past few days, it is possible he has been the victim of a poison attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019re not shy about poisoning, Putin\u2019s guys. (For a story about Navalny, go here.)\n\nA question: What if Navalny dies? What will the reaction of the rest of the world be, and of the United States in particular? (Years ago, we enjoyed the designation \u201cLeader of the Free World.\u201d) Will there be a shrug, as in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi? A statement of regret from the State Department? Something a bit sterner, possibly?\n\nWill a mouthy, conscientious member of Congress say something?\n\nThese are things to be thought of, even now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, President Trump was asked who ought to be held accountable for the Khashoggi murder. \u201cMaybe the world should be held accountable,\u201d he answered, \u201cbecause the world is a vicious place.\u201d\n\nNext time, we will do better, I hope.\n\n\u2022 Here is a report from last week:\n\nA prominent LGBT rights campaigner has been found dead with multiple stab wounds and signs of strangulation in the Russian city of St Petersburg. The body of a 41-year-old woman was found in bushes near her home in the city on Sunday, local police said. Relatives and friends later named the victim as Yelena Grigoryeva . . . Ms Grigoryeva, who had reportedly received death threats, regularly campaigned for human rights in Russia.\n\nThey are possibly the most careless people in the world, these Russian activists. They keep losing their lives.\n\n\u2022 In this new era of strongmen, who will defend democracy? Who will stick up for it, even fight for it? Look to the streets of Hong Kong and Moscow, where democracy protesters are being beaten by thugs. I admire them no end \u2014 the protesters, that is, not the thugs. Would I be among those protesters? Would you?\n\nFor myself, I can\u2019t answer with confidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish someone in the United States would utter a peep for them \u2014 not scribblers and yakkers like me, but an official. If it can\u2019t be the president, how about a congressman, how about anybody? Someone willing to express the solidarity, or at least the best wishes, of the American people?\n\nHe likes to keep a low profile, following the example of his ex-president father, but I nominate George W. Bush.\n\n\u2022 According to reports, the Iranian economy is in free fall. Hurray, I guess. But I must tell you something: One reason I prize Magnitsky sanctions is that they target individuals \u2014 wrongdoers, human-rights violators, villains \u2014 not populations at large.\n\nWill our sanctions on Iran backfire? Will they cause a pro-American population to turn against us and rally to their oppressive regime? I don\u2019t know.\n\nBut these are questions that policymakers always have to weigh (and I\u2019m sure ours have).\n\n\u2022 The temperature is awfully high in America now \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about the weather, although the heat, in some places, has been rough. I\u2019m talking about politics, and race in particular.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is only 2019. How about 2020, when the presidential election is in full swing? How much higher can the temperature go? Will America be able to take it, without combusting?\n\nFor years, through the Reagan administration, Michael Kinsley predicted \u201ca long hot summer\u201d \u2014 because people would rebel against the depredations of the Reaganites, essentially. The long hot summer never came. Kinsley, to his credit, joked about it.\n\nAnyway, I hope the summer of 2020 is on the cool side, but I\u2019m not predicting it (especially having no training in meteorology).\n\n\u2022 For reasons I could explain, I went back to a book review I wrote in 2017. I covered two books, actually: a collection by Gertrude Himmelfarb and a collection of Kenneth Minogue. In this review, I quoted Roger Scruton, and I think I will do a little pasting \u2014 copying and pasting.\n\nHere goes:\n\nScruton, after Minogue\u2019s passing, wrote an appreciation, saying, \u201cIn many ways he was a model of the conservative activist. He was not in the business of destroying things or angering people. He was in the business of defending old-fashioned civility against ideological rage, and he believed this was the real meaning of the freedom that the English-speaking peoples have created and enjoyed.\u201d Scruton also said, \u201cFor Ken Minogue, decency was not just a way of doing things, but also the point of doing them.\u201d That is an unusual, striking sentence, worth pondering.\n\nYes. I am thinking of David French, my friend and colleague, who has been attacked as \u2014 well, too decent to be a real conservative, and to get things done. David was moved to write a piece called \u201cDecency Is No Barrier to Justice or the Common Good\u201d (here).\n\nDavid is a warrior \u2014 in the courtroom, on the battlefield (the literal one), in journalism, and in still other arenas. But he\u2019s not a jackass, which a lot of people resent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(I understand them, so help me. I touched on this in an article earlier this year, here.)\n\n\u2022 Look, far be it from me to comment on wine \u2014 I have no standing. (Whines, yes; wines, no.) But President Trump tweeted, \u201cI\u2019ve always said American wine is better than French wine!\u201d\n\nMy feeling is: Maybe we give them this one. Wine. If we Yanks need to boast \u2014 \u201cwhere there\u2019s never a boast or brag\u201d \u2014 there are other things . . .\n\n\u2022 Speaking of tweets, I loved one from Tiana Lowe of the Washington Examiner, formerly of National Review. She was reacting to a story headlined \u201cIs it weird for adults to visit Disney parks without kids? Twitter fiercely debates.\u201d She wrote, \u201cI just cannot imagine having the energy to care if other people minding their own business went to an amusement park.\u201d\n\nThis reminded me of something George Bush said, a long time ago. (I mean Bush the Elder.) It went something like this: \u201cOne reason I\u2019m a conservative is that I don\u2019t toss and turn nights, worried that someone, somewhere, is having a good time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(I realize that today\u2019s Right does not consider Bush to have been a conservative. During his career, however, he was a right-wing monster, at least in the eyes of the Left.)\n\n\u2022 Care for a little language? Here\u2019s a golf article from Reuters. The headline: \u201cKoepka dominates one-sided bout with McIlroy in Memphis.\u201d If you have \u201cdominates,\u201d you don\u2019t need \u201cone-sided.\u201d That\u2019s redundant.\n\nBut I loved a phrase within the article \u2014 one that is new to me: \u201c. . . McIlroy missed a short birdie putt at the third hole from inside four feet and never recovered, his body language the only evidence needed that he was not quite on-song.\u201d\n\nOn-song. Must be a Britishism. A good one.\n\n\u2022 Here\u2019s an old-fashioned word: moxie. More and more, I admire this, as one of the best qualities. It came to mind when I was reading this piece by Will E. Young, who was a student journalist at Liberty University. What moxie this kid had, and has. It\u2019ll stand him in good stead as he journeys onward.\n\n\u2022 Some names? I have a new young colleague named Chris Tremoglie \u2014 Three Wives. I said, \u201cAh, a bigamist!\u201d This week, I got a letter from a man named Cinquemani. I said, \u201cThank you, my five-handed friend!\u201d (He replied, \u201cThat would have made Grandpa smile.\u201d)\n\nAs regular readers know, I\u2019m fond of names, and always interested in them, and I bet these two names have very good stories behind them, unknown to us moderns.\n\n\u2022 Every day, I hear talk of \u201cprivilege.\u201d And, almost always, people mean the material. If I were the exhorting type, I would exhort all parents: Make your children \u201cprivileged\u201d \u2014 with good books, good music, good games, good humor, sound morals, and, above all, real love.\n\n\u2022 I saw a photo the other day and thought \u2014 and said \u2014 \u201cMagazine-worthy.\u201d It was snapped by our Molly Powell \u2014 National Review\u2019s Molly Powell \u2014 who lives in New Hampshire. With her permission, I share it with you.\n\nA bit of New Hampshire on a late afternoon, with bee balm and daylilies gracing the stage:", "description": "On Russia, Iran, the U.S., decency, wine, a photo, and more.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Jack Crowe", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kyle Smith", "Rich Lowry", "Read More"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/alexei-navalny-supporters.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
