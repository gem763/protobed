Greg Abbott (R) released a series of executive orders on Thursday in response to two recent mass shootings in the state \u2015 and none of them address gun control.\n\nThe Republican governor, an avid gun-rights advocate, issued eight orders, including one requiring the department of public safety to develop guidance for how law enforcement agencies should submit reports on suspicious activity. Another aimed to create an awareness-raising initiative for the public to be \u201cmore likely to report information about potential gunmen.\u201d\n\nIn his announcement, the governor acknowledged that \u201cmore must be done,\u201d and said he would work \u201cexpeditiously\u201d with lawmakers on \u201claws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals, while safeguarding the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding Texans.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what legislative measures Abbott plans to push. HuffPost reached out to Abbott for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nAs of this month, it is now even easier to carry guns in Texas churches, schools and more, due to several bills passed by Texas lawmakers in May and later signed by Abbott, which loosened the state\u2019s already lenient restrictions on guns.\n\nThe National Rifle Association \u2015 which has given Abbott an \u201cA\u201d rating for being \u201cpro-gun\u201d \u2015 praised the recent bills as \u201cNRA-supported legislation.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidate and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) \u2015 who has issued policy plans and emotional pleas for gun control after the mass shootings in his home state \u2015 was quick to point out what was missing from Abbott\u2019s executive action plan:\n\nNot one of these orders mentions guns... https://t.co/mv1M2QZ1Yl \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 5, 2019\n\nIn recent years, the state has seen several high-profile mass shootings on its soil, including a 2018 school shooting in Santa Fe that left 10 people dead and a 2017 church shooting near San Antonio that left 26 people dead, half of whom were children.\n\nIn other states, governors have used their executive powers to take action on guns in the past.\n\nIn August, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) announced an executive order on guns, including increasing data sharing across law enforcement agencies, expanding the state\u2019s gun buyback program and increasing surveillance on hate groups to prevent mass shootings. Wolf also called on legislators to mandate universal background checks on all gun purchases.\n\nIn North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper (D) signed an executive directive on guns last month, including strengthening background checks by increasing data sharing between the state and the federal background check system.\n\nUnder current Texas laws, legal gun owners don\u2019t need an additional permit to carry long guns \u2015 like the ones used in the El Paso and Odessa shootings \u2015 in unrestricted public areas. There is also no background check requirement for private sales, a loophole through which the Odessa shooter, who had failed a 2014 background check, was able to buy the gun he used.", "description": "Gov.
