I was raised Christian and have Jewish ancestors. When I was offered an amazing opportunity to visit the places I\u2019d read about in the Bible growing up, I said yes. There is something absolutely magical about Israel. I\u2019ve never felt such a sense of spirituality or connection to God\u2026something I\u2019ve been missing for a few years now. Spirituality is so important to me\u2026to be baptized in the Jordan river \u2013 the same place Jesus was baptized \u2013 I\u2019ve never felt more renewed in my life. This trip has been so important for my well-being, my heart, and my soul. I\u2019m grateful for the memories made and the opportunity to be able to fill the God-sized hole in my heart. Thank you for having me, Israel.\n\nHowever, the 27-year-old singer faced an immediate backlash from anti-Israel campaigners, who accused her of undermining the Palestinian cause in the ongoing conflict.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely frustrated. I accepted a free trip to Israel in exchange for a few posts. No one told me there would be anything wrong with going or that I could possibly be offending anyone,\u201d she complained. \u201cWith that being said, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve hurt or offended anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes people present you with opportunities and no one tells you the potential backlash you could face in return,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis was meant to be a spiritual experience for me, NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT and now I realize it hurt people and for that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nLovato, who nearly died last year of a heroin overdose, has occasionally waded into political debates with regard to LGBT rights, mental health, and the imposition of stricter gun laws.\n\nIn 2016, she spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia about raising awareness for mental health, while she also performed at the anti-Second Amendment March for Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C. in March last year.", "description": "Pop superstar Demi Lovato has apologized\u00a0after facing backlash for visiting Israel, and insisted that \"no one told\" her that there would be any issue with her visiting the country.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/demilovatobaptize1-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
