Now, just a year later, there are 19, according to the Champlain Local Health Integration Network (LHIN).\n\nThe Champlain LHIN has determined Konopeskas, who has cerebral palsy, needs three PSWs to visit twice a day for about an hour each time, first to get her out of bed and assist with her personal hygiene in the morning, then again in the evening to get her back into bed.\n\nBefore she was admitted to hospital, Konopeskas had the help of just one PSW twice a day.\n\n\"It costs over $1,000 to have me here every day,\" she said. \"It would be cheaper to have the PSWs, and as a taxpayer and a citizen ... I'm ashamed to be here.\"\n\nKonopeskas says she's lost mobility since being admitted to hospital, where she's receiving no physiotherapy. (CBC)\n\nLosing mobility\n\nPrior to her surgery in November 2017, Konopeskas, who taught high school English and French before becoming a federal government translator, was able to walk and used a scooter for longer distances.\n\nShe said she's lost mobility since being in hospital, where she isn't receiving any physiotherapy.\n\nThere's no privacy and no dignity. - Maria Konopeskas\n\n\"I have slowed down and I've gotten weaker,\" she said. \"Being in the hospital has done that.\"\n\nKonopeskas said she's seen a hand-pedalling machine gathering dust in a nearby office at the Ottawa Hospital's General campus.\n\n\"I want to move and exercise so my muscles don't hurt,\" she said. \"I've been begging to use it.\"\n\n'The safest option'\n\nThe Champlain LHIN would not agree to an interview, but in a statement interim CEO Catherine Butler said the agency is committed to meeting the needs of its home-care clients.\n\n\"Recently, the province-wide shortage of PSWs has been affecting our ability to do so for all of our clients in this region. At times, because of this shortage, the safest option for some clients is to remain in hospital,\" Butler wrote.\n\n\"We deeply and genuinely regret the problems this shortage causes for our clients and their loved ones, and completely understand clients want to go home.\"\n\nKonopeskas enjoys a rare visit. 'People have forgotten about me.' (CBC)\n\nKonopeskas's private hospital hospital room is small and crammed with books. The sunny window ledge is dotted with flowering plants.\n\n\"I read a lot, I think a lot and I pray a lot, but the days here are long,\" she said. \"They are rather soul-destroying, and it's monotonous.\"\n\nHer room is on a locked ward, and she often hears the shouts of older dementia patients in the night.\n\n\"There's no privacy and no dignity,\" she said. \"My friends haven't seen me. People have forgotten about me.\"\n\nMore demand for PSWs\n\nRobin Meyers, director of community support services at Carefor, a not-for-profit agency that provides community health care in Ottawa, said there's been a 40 per cent increase in the demand for PSW services over the last two years.\n\nDespite hiring more than 100 new workers in that time, Meyers said Carefor is still short 15 employees.\n\nThe average PSW who works in a client's home earns about $19 per hour, $5 or $6 less than they would in a hospital, Meyers said.\n\n\"To bring this ... crisis under control, it's not just the actual shortage of PSWs,\" she said \"There's wage parity, job conditions and recruitment, and everyone has to come to the table to solve this.\"\n\nRobin Meyers is director of community support services for Carefor. (supplied )\n\nApartment sits empty\n\nAfter a long wait for an accessible apartment in a housing co-op in Vanier, Konopeskas finally got a unit in July 2018 \u2014 while she lay languishing in hospital. She's never lived there.\n\n\"It's what I hold on to, and I keep saying I've got a home to go home to,\" she said. \"I've paid rent for over a year and I've paid hydro and for a water heater [even thought] I haven't used one drop of that water. But I'm not going to lose it. I waited too long to get it.\"\n\nOn Nov. 26, Konopeskas will contest the LHIN's PSW assessment before Ontario's Health Services Appeal and Review Board, where she'll be represented pro bono by a lawyer who will argue for her discharge from hospital.\n\n\"I'm going to have my say,\" she said. \"I pray for justice.\"", "description": "Maria Konopeskas, who has cerebral policy, has an accessible apartment waiting for her.
