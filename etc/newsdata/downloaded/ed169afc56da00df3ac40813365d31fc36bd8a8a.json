REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nThe couple disembarked from a British Royal Air Force plane, after an eight-hour flight, at about 9.30 p.m. (1630 GMT) at Nur Khan Airforce base in Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad.\n\nThey were greeted by Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Thomas Drew, the British High Commissioner, as well as two children who gave them bouquets of flowers.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge wore a long pale blue variation of the shalwar kameez, a dress or tunic worn over trousers, Pakistan\u2019s traditional national outfit that many on social media and in the fashion industry had hoped she would don during her visit. Prince William wore a navy suit with a blue tie.\n\nThe trip has been described by Kensington Palace as the most complex the couple have undertaken due to security and logistical issues. It is the first by members of the British royal family in more than a decade.\n\nThe release of public details of the tour were limited due to tight security, but the visit would take them around the north and west of the nation of 208 million people, with the focus on climate change, access to education and security.\n\n\u201cThe couple would like to see the breadth and depth of the country from the leafy capital here in Islamabad to the vibrant city of Lahore, the mountainous countryside of the north and the rugged border regions of the west,\u201d the British High Commissioner said in a video on his official Twitter account.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking forward to building a lasting friendship with the people of Pakistan. I know they will get a very warm welcome,\u201d he added.\n\nExcitement built up on Monday, with \u2018#RoyalVisitPakistan\u2019 trending on Twitter and television stations airing footage from historic royal visits, including one by Prince William\u2019s grandmother Queen Elizabeth in 1961.\n\nSome rickshaw drivers in Lahore and Rawalpindi, a garrison city next to Islamabad, painted their vehicles with the Pakistani and British flags.\n\nForeign policy experts and officials have said the trip, made at the request of the British foreign office, represented a soft power push, which may help both sides further their diplomatic aims.\n\nIt comes as Britain seeks to reinvigorate its foreign relationships with the looming deadline for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, while Pakistan works to repair its global image to boost tourism and investment.", "description": "Prince William and his wife Kate arrived in Pakistan's capital on Monday, beginning a five-day visit that will focus on boosting ties and addressing challenges such as climate change.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440802584&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1H6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
