When the current monetary operational procedures were put in place in the early 1980s, a central element was that the RBA would operate only at the short end of the yield curve, to set the overnight cash rate. This fitted the intellectual vogue for minimal interference with free-market outcomes, but there were good practical reasons as well.\n\nLeaving the market to set the long end of the yield curve gave useful feedback on the state of financial markets, inflation expectations and the business cycle.\n\nMore important still, it meant that the RBA was not directly involved in orchestrating the price of a wide range of financial assets. When long-term rates fall, the capital value of longer-term bonds rises. This is happy news for bond-holders. With falling yields, bond-holders made more than 10% return in the first half of this year, mainly from capital gains. But when the time comes for long-term rates to rise, the substantial capital losses for bondholders will be unwelcome. If the RBA is setting this asset price, it will be blamed, undermining its reputation and perhaps making it reluctant to take the necessary action. Better to leave the price of longer-term securities to the unconstrained market.\n\nWhere does this leave QE? If it is just a largely ineffectual measure which, while doing little to stimulate the economy, doesn\u2019t do much harm other than offend a few operational technicalities, then the RBA might as well give in to the pressure to act, just to demonstrate that it is doing all it can to support the economy.\n\nBut futile measures can delay effective responses. Recall the 1990 recession. When Bob Hawke\u2019s new treasurer John Kerin introduced his belated stimulatory budget in mid-1991, the cycle was already at its nadir. By the time the deficit had its stimulatory effect, the recovery was already well under way with such vigour that wages rose quickly and the RBA had to raise interest rates sharply to hold the line on inflation. A timely and modest budget stimulus, applied earlier in the cycle, would have softened \u2018the recession we had to have\u2019.\n\nFiscal expansion is slower to put in place than monetary policy. This is not an argument against its use: it is a reason for being ready to implement it in a timely way. That moment is now, and delaying until the RBA has given QE a try is just a futile diversion.", "description": "Trying the most ineffective option first simply means that better policies will come along too late.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8869%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_560%2C$y_325/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cdae4df7a7084a9e33f34ffdfc2cacdd272bcfc3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
