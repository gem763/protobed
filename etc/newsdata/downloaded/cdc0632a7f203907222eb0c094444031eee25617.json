Epstein was arrested in July on new, federal charges of sexually abusing dozens of girls in the early 2000s. In August, he was found dead while in federal custody.\n\nThe revelations prompted renewed scrutiny of Epstein's philanthropy and the sometimes complicated relationships between donors and institutions\n\nHarvard's decentralisation makes a review more complicated than it would be at some other institutions, Mr Bacow wrote.\n\nMost of the gifts from Epstein, designated for use on research and education, were spent years ago, Mr Bacow wrote.\n\nThe largest gift, $6.5 million (\u00a35.2m), was given in 2003 for the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and spent by 2007, according to the university.\n\nThe ongoing review identified a current-use fund and a gift to arts and sciences faculty with an unspent balance of $186,000 (\u00a3149,000), Mr Bacow noted, and university officials have decided to donate that amount to funds benefiting victims of trafficking and sexual assault.\n\n\"This is an unusual step for the University,\" Mr Bacow wrote, \"but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein's egregiously repugnant crimes.\"\n\nMr Bacow also noted that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member who had benefited from donations from Epstein, designated Epstein as a visiting fellow in the psychology department in 2005, and that they were working to learn more about that appointment.\n\nMr Kosslyn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\n\"Epstein's behaviour, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors,\" Mr Bacow wrote. He said he would convene a group at Harvard to consider how to prevent such situations, and expressed hope that peer institutions could collaborate on solutions.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein's crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard's past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact . . .\"\n\n\"Harvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.\"\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nRead more\n\nHead of MIT research lab steps down over Epstein ties\n\nPrince Andrew makes first appearance since since Epstein scandal\n\nJeremy Renner shuts down app after trolls impersonate Jeffrey Epstein\n\nSealed documents 'contain hundreds of names mentioned in Epstein case'\n\nPeter Mandelson pictured with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005\n\nWhat Epstein's accusers had to say when given their moment in court", "description": "Harvard University accepted about $9 million (\u00a37.2 million) in donations from financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1998 and 2007, according to results of an investigation released Thursday evening by the school's president.In a letter to the campus, Harvard President Lawrence Bacow said the school rejected", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_vnWfZAni1VPq_o7rLY_zw--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/48fa37250b9e187b22c8110dff0561d1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
