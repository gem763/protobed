But the social network confesses that it still has a lot to learn.\n\nThe social media giant said Thursday it is expanding its \u201cToday In\u201d service to 6,000 cities and towns across the U.S., up from 400 before.\n\nLaunched in early 2018, the service lets Facebook users opt into local information, including news articles, missing-person alerts, local election results, road closures and crime reports. Facebook aggregates posts from the official Facebook pages for news organizations, schools, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters.\n\nThe mobile-only tool lives within the Facebook app; turning it on adds local updates to a user\u2019s regular news feed. In areas with scant local news, Facebook will add relevant articles from surrounding areas.\n\nSome 1,800 newspapers have closed in the United States over the past 15 years, according to research from the University of North Carolina. Newsroom employment has declined by 45% as the industry struggles with a broken business model partly caused by the success of companies on the internet, including Facebook.\n\nCampbell Brown, head of global news partnerships at Facebook, said Facebook has a responsibility to support journalism, while also noting that the media industry has been in decline \u201cfor a very long time.\u201d Brown, a former news anchor and host at NBC and CNN, said local reporting remains the most important form of journalism today.\n\n\u201cThere is no silver bullet,\u201d Brown said in an interview. \u201cWe really want to help publishers address challenges in local markets.\u201d\n\nWarren St. John, CEO of hyperlocal news service Patch, said the service means potential new readers because it goes to people who haven\u2019t necessarily liked a Patch Facebook page.\n\n\u201cFacebook has taken its lumps, perhaps rightly so over the last couple of years, but I think what they have done around local news is pretty unique,\u201d he said. This includes grants and accelerator programs for local news organizations, \u201cpassing the expertise and knowledge of a Silicon Valley tech firm down to the local publisher ecosystem.\u201d\n\nToday In won\u2019t automatically turn on for people even in the areas it serves, which could limit its reach. So far, Facebook says, 1.6 million people have activated the feature and receive news from some 1,200 publishers every week.\n\nThe service has no human editors and uses software filters to weed out objectionable content. Tweaking the algorithm to find relevant local stories has been complicated. Does a road closure matter if it\u2019s 100 miles away? How about a murder?\n\nAlready, Facebook says it\u2019s learned from publishers\u2019 input about what doesn\u2019t work. For instance, it now allows only posts from publishers registered with its \u201cNews page index,\u201d which means they meet guidelines such as focusing on current events and information, and don\u2019t have a record of publishing misinformation. Obituaries from funeral homes and real estate posts \u2014 both of which previously showed up under \u201cnews\u201d \u2014 are no longer eligible.\n\nFacebook has also learned that local news doesn\u2019t work like national news. Political stories, for instance, don\u2019t generate a lot of local interest.\n\nFacebook isn\u2019t paying licensing fees or sharing ad revenue with these news outlets. But the company says publishers get additional referrals to their websites, more so than when people see the same stories in their regular news feed, based on data from its test partners.\n\nWhile people scroll through their news feeds passively, people engage with articles more when they appear in Today In, said Jimmy O\u2019Keefe, a product marketing manager at Facebook.\n\nGoogle also announced changes to its news service Thursday, saying it would slightly alter its search system so original news stories on a topic show up before follow-ups or repeated news from other publications. Similar to Facebook, the company has been working on showing news articles from authoritative, proven publications.\n\nOutside researchers studying local news data provided by Facebook found that about half of the news stories in the Today In feature met what they called a \u201ccritical information need\u201d in the communities it served.\n\nThe researchers said Facebook users interacted the most with stories serving a critical need \u2014 such as information on emergencies, transportation and health \u2014 even though \u201cnon-critical\u201d stories such as sports were more numerous. The researchers \u2014 Matthew Weber at the University of Minnesota and Peter Andringa and Philip Napoli at Duke University \u2014 received no funding from Facebook.\n\nLarge metro areas such as New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco are still excluded from Today In. The abundance of news and population density there makes it more difficult to provide relevant local information. A big local story in Brooklyn, for instance, might be irrelevant in the same borough just a few miles away.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Facebook is trying to coax \"news deserts\" into bloom with the expansion of a tool that exposes people to more local news and information.", "authors": ["Barbara Ortutay"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/facebook-today-in-local-news-expansion.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
