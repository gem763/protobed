To address it, they were advised, they should reach out to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to the interviews and records.\n\nThe timing of the communications about the issue, which have not previously been reported, shows that Ukraine was aware the White House was holding up the funds weeks earlier than United States and Ukrainian officials had acknowledged. And it means that the Ukrainian government was aware of the freeze during most of the period in August when Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and two American diplomats were pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a public commitment to the investigations being sought by Mr. Trump.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Ukraine-Aid-Freeze-Impeachment.Html Smid Tw-Nytimes Smtyp Cur"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
