The new launcher, creatively titled the Rockstar Games Launcher, is a way for players to buy and play Rockstar games. It\u2019s very bare-bones at the moment, but it works. Mostly.\n\nThe Rockstar Launcher was first spotted by numerous GTA and Red Dead fans across Twitter earlier today. It\u2019s similar to Blizzard\u2019s Battle.net launcher with a similar layout and store.\n\nThere are seven games currently for sale, though games like Manhunt, Midnight Club, older top-down GTA titles and other classic Rockstar games aren\u2019t currently for sale. Users who download the launcher can get a free copy of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nWhen first downloaded and installed, the launcher adds Rockstar games you already own to your library. However, if you own those games on Steam, you have to click a button that says \u201cPlay On Steam,\u201d launching another launcher within the launcher. Fun! According to a blog post by Rockstar, the launcher also features cloud save and automatic updates.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet what this means for the future of Rockstar\u2019s games on PC. However, many Rockstar fans are speculating that this new launcher is further proof that Red Dead Redemption 2 will eventually be available for PC players.\n\nThere\u2019s not much in the Rockstar Launcher yet, though if you don\u2019t own San Andreas it\u2019s worth checking out. However, according to GTA data miners, the version is the same as the Steam version which is based on the mobile ports and is missing some graphical touches and songs.", "description": "Rockstar Games has released a new digital launcher for its games on PC.
