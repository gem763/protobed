More recently, Rihanna demanded that the president cease playing her hit \u201cDon\u2019t Stop the Music\u201d at what she called his \u201ctragic rallies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe estate representing Prince, who died in 2016 at age 57, first joined that angry chorus last October after Trump added \u201cPurple Rain\u201d to his regular playlist at his rallies, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign quickly responded, according to the letter posted on Twitter. The Oct. 15, 2018, letter from Megan Newton, a Washington-based attorney who has represented a GOP super PAC in the past, pledges that the Trump campaign \u201cwill not use Prince\u2019s music in connection with its activities going forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNeither Newton nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to messages about why that promise was apparently broken on Thursday.\n\nLike all the musicians who have tried to disentangle their work from Trump\u2019s political bombast, the legal recourse is murky for Prince\u2019s estate.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Travis M. Andrews reported in 2016, politicians generally have the right to use songs at rallies as long as they get a \u201cblanket license\u201d for the artist\u2019s entire catalogue from ASCAP and BMI, which license songs. Artists can opt out of BMI licenses, though, and others have sued under the theory that it\u2019s false advertising to implicitly suggest they support the candidate by using their music.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven if Donald Trump has the ASCAP right to use a Neil Young song, does Neil have the right to nevertheless go after him on right of publicity? I say he does,\u201d Lawrence Iser, a copyright attorney, told Rolling Stone after Trump used Young\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World\u201d to help announce his candidacy in 2015.\n\nDuring his career, Prince battled fiercely to maintain tight control over his music rights. And Prince\u2019s personal politics would seem an unlikely match for the GOP president, who used his Thursday night rally to once again slam refugees and former vice president Joe Biden. As the Hill reported, Prince supported the Black Lives Matter movement before his death and was close with President Barack Obama, even playing a secret show at the White House in 2015.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cThe Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince\u2019s songs.\u201d", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y3PXMi7K8DiKBvL9VbzaEiG4PmA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YGL2USUC6MI6TNMF4NVRNJJRVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
