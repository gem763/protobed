We may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.\n\nThe environmental impact of fast fashion has inspired change within the industry. With textile production releasing more carbon equivalent (CO2e) per year than international flights and maritime shipping combined, many brands have risen to the challenge of creating sustainable fashion products.\n\nA few months ago I set out on a fashion challenge to educate myself and explore the world of sustainable footwear. Beyond recycling and using public transit whenever possible, I had no idea I could effect change by doing what I already love to do: shop.\n\nALSO SEE: The 'invincible' winter boot you'll be seeing everywhere this year\n\nI\u2019ve rounded up some of the most popular sustainable sneakers on the market in an effort to help you make more socially and environmentally responsible choices.\n\nRoyal seal of approval: Rothy\u2019s\n\nI was first introduced to Rothy\u2019s after Meghan Markle wore a pair of the brand\u2019s woven flats during her royal tour of Australia in 2018. Combining both fashion and function, Rothy\u2019s has transformed more than 40 million plastic water bottles into shoes for both women and kids. Available in a variety of styles, I opted for The Sneaker in Black Honeycomb as an alternative to my basic black flats.\n\nAs someone with a wide foot, Rothy\u2019s are a snug fit. They aren\u2019t uncomfortable, but they don\u2019t have much give. I love that my Rothy\u2019s are designed to be machine washable. Instead of searching for ways to wash and take care of some of my other favourite sneakers, I just have to remove the sustainable insoles, toss them in the wash on cold and let them air dry.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage via Rothy's.

The one downfall about fast fashion (aside from the environmental impact) is that although it\u2019s affordable, it\u2019s often low quality, which makes finding a product that has the best of both worlds a challenge. Thankfully, ALDO shoes has introduced a new line of sneakers made from 100% recycled polyester knit and a foam sole that contains algae biomass that are affordable and comfortable. According to their website, the each pair of shoes in their RPPL collection helped clean and filter 35 litres of polluted water in an attempt to help solve the algae crisis threatening freshwater marine life.\n\nHaving worn my pair of light pink RPPLs for several weeks, aside from the price tag, I really enjoy that the design can go toe-to-toe with pricier sneaker brands. I can dress my RPPLs up or down thanks to their athletic lace-up look and have worn them on several long walks with my dogs without issue. If you\u2019re looking to dip your toe into the world of sustainable shoes without breaking the bank, this is a great place to start.\n\nImage via ALDO.
