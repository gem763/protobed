It's unclear when they will return.\n\nThe vice president has become the leading voice on the push for a cease-fire in the region as Trump remains committed to pulling troops out of Syria and has called on other countries to fill the void left by the U.S.\n\n\"We\u2019re having very strong talks with a lot of people,\" Trump said at a White House ceremony on Tuesday afternoon to honor the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues. \"We want to bring our soldiers back home after so many years. They\u2019re the greatest warriors in the world. They\u2019re policing. They\u2019re not a police force.\u201d\n\n\"We\u2019re being very tough on Turkey and a lot of others,\" he added. \"They have to maintain their own properties now. They have to maintain peace and safety.\"\n\nPence told reporters on Monday that Trump urged Erdo\u011fan to halt a Turkish invasion into northern Syria and begin negotiations with Kurdish forces in the region.\n\nEfforts to broker a cease-fire, paired with sanctions on Ankara announced Monday, mark a shift in strategy for the White House amid fierce bipartisan backlash over Trump's decision to pull U.S. troop out of northern Syria.\n\nThe change in strategy has had a ripple effect in the roughly 10 days since it was announced.\n\nWithin days, Turkey had launched an offensive into the region. The Turks targeted Kurdish forces, which have served as a key ally to the U.S. in the years-long fight against ISIS in the region.\n\nIn an effort to turn back the Turkish offensive, the Kurds struck a deal to join Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. The two had previously been on opposing sides of a bloody civil war, and Assad is backed by Russia.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will join Vice President Pence on a trip to Turkey this week in an attempt to broker a cease-fire in northern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pencepompeo_10152019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
