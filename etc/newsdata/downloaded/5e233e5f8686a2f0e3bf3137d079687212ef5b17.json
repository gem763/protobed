The video, and transcripts of the interview, were made public on Friday after an Ontario judge lifted a publication ban. Families of the victims were shown the video before it was released to the public.\n\nDuring the meandering discussion with Detective Rob Thomas, Minassian said he belonged to an online subculture of sexually frustated men, and described his path towards radicalization, saying he drew inspiration from other men who used violence as a form of retribution for \u201cbeing unable to get laid\u201d.\n\n\u201cI know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way,\u201d he said, adding they are \u201ctoo cowardly to act on their anger\u201d.\n\nClad in a white prison jumpsuit, Minassian told police that his interactions with women left him embarrassed and angry. He described a Halloween party in 2013, where he tried to speak with young women, but was often ignored or laughed at.\n\n\u201cI consider myself a supreme gentleman,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI was angry that they would give their love and affection to obnoxious brutes.\u201d\n\nWho are the 'incels' and how do they relate to Toronto van attack? Read more\n\nA friend at Toronto\u2019s Seneca College, where Minassian studied software development, first directed him to online message boards for men who identify as \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d or \u201cincels\u201d.\n\nThe group views their inability to meet women as punishment for their status as \u201cbeta-males\u201d and direct their anger at the people with active sex lives who they derisively call \u201cChad\u201d and \u201cStacey\u201d.\n\nMinassian claimed to have been in contact with Elliot Rodger, who killed six people and himself in a 2014 the campus at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2014. Rodger was a self-described incel who posted deeply misogynist videos and a sprawling online manifesto calling for an \u201coverthrow\u201d of what he said was feminist domination.\n\nMinassian told police he was \u201cradicalized\u201d at around the time of Rodger\u2019s attack \u2013 and began to fantasize about starting his own \u201crebellion\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was thinking that I would inspire future masses to join me in my uprising as well,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told police that he decided that a 10ft delivery van \u201cwas the perfect medium size to use as \u2026 my weapon\u201d.\n\nWhile he hadn\u2019t initially chosen Yonge Street as his target \u2013 one of the busiest thoroughfares in Toronto \u2013 he decided it was \u201ctime to go for it\u201d after seeing all of the pedestrians milling about the shops lining the street.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that this is it \u2013 this is the day of retribution,\u201d he told Thomas.\n\nThe video also revealed how the attack was stopped.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s drink got splashed on my windshield, and I was worried that I would crash the van anyways,\u201d said Minassian, explaining why he stopped the vehicle and got out.\n\nHe then sought out a police officer, hoping to provoke a \u201csuicide by cop\u201d. But Ken Lam, a constable, resisted opening fire on Minassian, even though he repeatedly pretended to draw a weapon.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t react,\u201d said Minassian.\n\nMinassian\u2019s trial, which will begin in February 2020, will be overseen by only a judge alone. Minassian has admitted to driving the van but has not yet entered a plea. The judge overseeing the case has said that Minassian\u2019s state of mind will be an important part of the trial.\n\n", "description": "Alek Minassian said in an interview after his arrest he drew inspiration from men who used violence as retribution for \u2018being unable to get laid\u2019", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abe2db610c1441c86d76744f40694e0888418c83/0_182_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0f4c2bcd3ebb93ae7546ad9bdd86d5a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
