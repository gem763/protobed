The only thing missing was the scrutiny and sniping from competitors that normally accompanies the rise of a new primary leader.\n\nThat changed on Tuesday night at Otterbein University, a small college outside Columbus, Ohio. Otterbein was named after the founder of the United Brethren in Christ, but the mood was anything but brotherly as Warren faced a barrage of criticisms from most of the other 11 Democrats on stage.\n\nThe candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused \u2014 sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly \u2014 of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues\u2019 ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were \u201cpunitive\u201d and a theory of governing that was a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s biggest gains have come since the last debate, so Tuesday's debate was the natural point for a more full-throated engagement from the other candidates. Until now, three elements central to Warren\u2019s candidacy have received relatively little pressure from her opponents as she has slowly ticked up in the polls.\n\nThe first is whether the candidate of always having a plan can escape the question of Medicare for All\u2019s cost that has haunted her candidacy for months. The second is the corollary character question about whether her refusal to cough up more details and numbers will damage Warren\u2019s robust approval ratings. Finally, Warren has made strides to convince Democrats that she can beat Trump, but until Tuesday she hasn\u2019t had to answer sustained attacks that her platform is too far left to win.\n\nShe seemed to hold up relatively well \u2014 no major slip-ups \u2014 but the arguments her rivals made against her are a harbinger of what\u2019s to come this fall, after a relatively smooth ascent over the past several months.\n\nWarren is often credited with running the most disciplined campaign, and she was clearly prepared for the evening\u2019s offensive. Indeed, her most persistent critic, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has raised as much money as Warren but has only a fifth of the vote share to show for it, has been signaling for weeks that he would aggressively challenge her in Ohio.\n\nThrough three hours of sporadic attacks, Warren remained energetic (some voters had to be surprised to learn midway through the evening that Warren is 70 years old), occasionally cutting (\u201cMedicare for all who can afford it,\u201d she called Buttigieg\u2019s plan), and unmoved by her interlocutors\u2019 insistence that she confess to the true costs of her health care plan. (A direct question \u2014 \u201cWill you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?\u201d \u2014 was answered with references to \u201cmy principles,\u201d the number of selfies she\u2019s taken this year and anecdotes about the indignities of the modern medical system, but neither a yes or a no.)\n\nThe evening\u2019s attacks began with the issue that has dominated all four Democratic primary debates \u2014 in fact, the issue that has dominated Democratic politics since FDR: how to achieve universal medical insurance in the United States.\n\nUnlike Bernie Sanders, the progenitor of the Warren policy, the Massachusetts senator has declined to explain how she would pay for her plan to transition all Americans into the popular Medicare program that now only serves people over 65. Her refusal to detail the costs was turned into cudgel by Buttigieg and others to question not just her policy but her honesty.\n\n\u201cWe heard it tonight,\u201d said Buttigieg when asked whether Warren was \u201cevasive.\u201d \u201cA yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders butted into the conversation, it was as a foil that Warren\u2019s attackers could use. \"I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d said Sanders, one of the few candidates who declined to press Warren.", "description": "WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014\u00a0Elizabeth Warren has enjoyed many of the trappings of a front-runner: the polling lead in Iowa and New Hampshire, a near-tie with Joe Biden nationally, explosive fundraising, big crowds.
