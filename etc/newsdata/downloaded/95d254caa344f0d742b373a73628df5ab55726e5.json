The big mystery surrounding the company is how it will price and bundle forthcoming subscription video and gaming services, and Apple fans should expect new details when Chief Executive Tim Cook and his team take the stage.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why Roku thinks Apple and Disney will give the streaming platform a big boost\n\nCFRA analyst Angelo Zino is calling for a \u201cboring\u201d slate of iPhones on Tuesday, but he\u2019s still betting that the event will be \u201cmust-see TV\u201d due to the expected announcements on services. Reports indicate that Apple is planning to charge $4.99 a month for its Arcade gaming service and $9.99 a month for its Apple TV+ video product, and it will be interesting to see whether consumers are willing to pay up for those offerings given a lack of big-name publishers for Arcade and a relatively small content library for TV+.\n\n\u201cWe think Apple could look to perhaps bundle its Apple TV+ offering (for instance, alongside Apple Music) at a discounted rate to spur new subscribers,\u201d Zino wrote. He\u2019ll be looking for launch-date information on both TV+ and Arcade.\n\nRead: Apple has committed more than $6 billion to original content ahead of streaming launch, says report\n\nWhen it comes to the iPhone, Zino expects the company to keep its sizes and prices constant. Apple currently offers the 6.1-inch iPhone XR for a starting price of $749, the 5.8-inch iPhone XS for $999, and the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max for $1,199. Refreshed versions likely promise a faster processor across all models and a triple-lens camera for the two more expensive versions, according to Zino. The upcoming low-end model may again feature an LCD screen, but this might be the last time Apple goes with LCD technology in one of its new phones.\n\nSee also: Here\u2019s everything Apple isn\u2019t telling you about its new credit card\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives expects Apple to highlight the upgraded camera technology as well as new artificial-intelligence capabilities in the devices. Video and the device\u2019s construction could also be used as selling points.\n\n\u201cThe video capability on iPhone 11 Pro versions will be significantly stepped up with real-time re-cropping technology that appears to be quite impressive in our opinion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe shatter-resistant technology should improve durability of the iPhone 11 and will be another selling feature for upgrades.\u201d\n\nIves also thinks Cook may tease the next version of the AirPod wireless earphones, which could be waterproof and due out around the holidays.\n\nApple is scheduled to hold its fall \u201cspecial event\u201d at 1 p.m. Eastern time on Sept. 10. Its stock has climbed 35% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.09% , of which it is a component, has risen 15%.", "description": "Apple Inc.\u2019s fall event is usually all about the iPhone, but this year the device will likely be relegated to a supporting role.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG336_AppleT_ZG_20190325163149.jpg"}
