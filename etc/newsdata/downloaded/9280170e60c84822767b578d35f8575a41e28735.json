Environmental protection agents this week destroyed excavators and tractors found at an illegal mine in a national forest. Videos of the equipment on fire quickly spread across social media.\n\n\u201cLook, that\u2019s an order from our president, Jair Bolsonaro,\u201d one miner said in a video widely shared on messaging apps here. \u201cThey are burning the workers\u2019 equipment.\u201d\n\nThe damage, the miner said, would cost him $200,000.\n\nBolsonaro won the backing of Brazil\u2019s powerful agricultural lobby last year in part on promises to limit indigenous rights and expand development in the Amazon. In April, his administration said the government would no longer burn mining and logging equipment seized in raids of illegal operations. Agents had destroyed the equipment to prevent new mines from sprouting elsewhere.\n\n\n\nPolice raid a mining operation in the rainforest.

That is not the order.\u201d\n\nBut that was before the world started watching.\n\nAn international backlash against Bolsonaro\u2019s allegedly lax environmental oversight in the Amazon spiked with the fires in the rainforest last month, dealing the president his biggest crisis since he took office in January.\n\nDeforestation under Bolsonaro has nearly doubled, according to the country\u2019s Space Research Institute. Forest fires have surged. An international outcry over the destruction has led to boycotts of Brazilian leather abroad and jeopardized an important trade deal with Europe.\n\n\n\nBrazilian authorities monitor a fire they set to destroy machinery used for illegal mining. (Sebastiao Moreira/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nBolsonaro, caught between domestic calls for looser environmental regulation and global demands that Brazil preserve the rainforest, has dodged calls for international intervention while quietly increasing raids.\n\nThe president sent 800 soldiers and agents to the region to extinguish fires and look for illegal activity.\n\nTensions between environmental protection agents and farmers, loggers and miners in the region are rising. About 250 miners blocked traffic on a highway Monday and demanded a meeting with Environmental Minister Ricardo Sales to legalize their mines.\n\nEnvironmental protection agents who uncovered an illegal mine at an indigenous reservation were shot at last week.\n\nThe miners say they feel betrayed by the administration they helped elect.\n\n\u201cYou said this wouldn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d one miner said in a message posted online. \u201cI wish, Bolsonaro . . . that you could see this video and explain to Brazil why this is happening.\u201d\n\n[Bolsonaro wants to develop the Amazon. The Munduruku fear the end of their way of life.]\n\nBolsonaro is trying to lift Brazil out of years of economic stagnation. Nearly 13 million people are unemployed, and in the Amazon, where jobs are scarce, mining is increasingly attractive.\n\nBolsonaro said throughout his campaign last year that he wanted to tap into the riches of the Amazon to spur economic growth. He promised to open indigenous lands for mining.\n\nMining in indigenous reserves remains illegal, but critics say Bolsonaro\u2019s comments effectively encouraged invasions of tribal land. Greenpeace Brazil estimates that there are mines in 18 indigenous territories.\n\n\u201cMiners are workers, people who unfortunately live on the margins of society,\u201d said Danicley Aguiar, a member of Greenpeace\u2019s Amazon campaign. \u201cBut this is not how you fix their lives. They need economic growth and the creation of formal jobs.\u201d\n\nFor tribal members who live in the reserves, Aguiar said, mining has brought violence, disease and destruction. In July, illegal miners invaded the Waipi-Apina tribal land in the eastern Amazon and killed a tribal chief.\n\n\u201cFor indigenous people, these mines are a death sentence,\u201d Aguiar said. \u201cIf indigenous land were to be open for mining, it would mean the complete destruction of their political and social organization and the ecosystem in which they live.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsonaro says he might accept G-7 offer to help fight Amazon fires \u2014 if Macron apologizes\n\nAs the Amazon burns, breathing problems spike\n\nWhy the Amazon is burning, why it\u2019s likely to get worse\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The protest is the latest challenge for a president caught between domestic demands for development and international pressure to protect the rainforest.", "authors": ["Marina Lopes", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nlLYPGmZ2osQhV-Sf0tHZ6FaD1Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/76246LGT4QI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
