The world\u2019s largest arms fair is an event for those \u201cin the know\u201d, namely weapons manufacturers, international militaries and delegations from governments including Saudi Arabia.\n\nOrganisers hail the \u201cunrivalled scale\u201d of the four-day fair held at London\u2019s ExCeL centre, despite loud opposition from Sadiq Khan, the local authority and protesters who are arrested in their scores at every DSEI. More than 35,000 people are expected to attend this week, each one of them carefully vetted and searched before being allowed inside the cavernous conference centre to mingle with ministers and heads of the world\u2019s largest militaries.\n\nThey will be greeted by a jarring spectacle, where suited delegations quaff free wine over cabinets full of ammunition. Meetings deciding multi-million pound weapons deals happen in the shadow of real tanks and helicopters. DSEI puts an unsettlingly corporate sheen on what is, in reality, a festival of killing machines, from guns to drones, jets, ballistic missiles, hand grenades, rocket launchers and mortars. In the event\u2019s language, death is \u201cdefence\u201d, weapons are \u201ctechnology\u201d, and countries accused of war crimes and human rights abuses are \u201cstrategic partners\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAndrew Smith, of the Campaign Against Arms Trade, accused attendees of being \u201ctotally detached from the impact of the deals they are celebrating\u201d. \u201cThe kind of weapons being promoted at DSEI have played a central role in atrocities throughout the world. But that human cost will go totally unacknowledged by the organisers,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sales being negotiated next week will only strengthen the regimes and dictatorships in attendance and could be used in abuses for years to come.\u201d\n\nAll of this could not happen without the British government\u2019s support, which comes in the form of financial backing from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Trade, and the supply of a roster of ministers to deliver speeches and mingle with foreign delegations. The government has invited Saudi Arabia to the event, despite the Court of Appeal ruling the sale of weapons used in the Yemen war unlawful, and protests have long fallen on deaf ears.\n\nWhen The Independent visited the last DSEI in 2017, the then-defence secretary, Michael Fallon, suggested the UK would \u201cspread its wings across the world\u201d with increased arms and equipment exports after Brexit. \u201cAs we look, exiting the European Union, to go increasingly global, we see our equipment as a platform for even stronger partnership,\u201d Mr Fallon told delegates, while hailing Britain as the world\u2019s second-largest weapons exporter.\n\nAs hoped-for trade deals remain unsigned and the UK slides towards a no-deal Brexit, the government\u2019s reliance on the arms economy looks likely to continue for many years to come.", "description": "Most people will not have heard of Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) or be aware of its appearance in London every two years.
