Brown caused quite the scene during the flight, which was scheduled to fly from London to Amsterdam.\n\nThe visually impaired cyclist, who won bronze in the London 2012 Paralympics, is part of a climate change activist group called Extinction Rebellion, according to the Independent.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is just one of many groups protesting air travel's impact on climate change. According to the Air Transport Action Group, air travel accounts for 2 percent of global CO2 emissions.\n\nBrown live-streamed himself climbing on top of the airplane and explained, \u201cWe\u2019re protesting against government inaction on climate and ecological breakdown. They declare a climate emergency and then do nothing about it.\u201d\n\nHe climbed on the plane during boarding, according to the Independent, however he eventually stopped the live-stream because he was becoming \u201cdizzy\u201d and said he was \u201cscared\u201d of heights.\n\nHe had a valid ticket and had passed through security without an issue.\n\nA suspected fellow protester, who was also filming Brown\u2019s protest from the ground, was taken into custody for allegedly helping him get his plane ticket.\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protester is removed from a British Airways Plane at London City Airport. | George Cracknell Wright/LNP/Shutterstock More\n\nHe spent about an hour on the plane before being taken away by police, who used a cherry-picker to safely get him down, according to the BBC.\n\n\u201cThat was a reckless, stupid and dangerous thing to do for all concerned,\u201d Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick told the outlet. \u201cBut I think you can see that it is quite a hard thing to predict or stop from happening.\u201d\n\nBut Brown was not the only Extinction Rebellion protester to be arrested at London City Airport on Thursday. Another man, who has yet to be identified, refused to sit in his seat aboard an Aer Lingus flight bound for Dublin.\n\nBBC political editor Nicolas Watt was aboard the same flight and tweeted updates about the man, saying he \u201cstood up with [his] iPhone to deliver a lecture on climate change up and down the aisle.\u201d\n\nMy flight from London City airport to Dublin has just been grounded by a climate change protestor. On runway and about to take off when smartly dressed man in late middle age stood up with iPhone to deliver lecture on climate change up and down aisle \u2014 Nicholas Watt (@nicholaswatt) October 10, 2019\n\nWatt added that the man remained calm and polite, even when refusing the cabin crew\u2019s orders to take his seat. The man was escorted off the plane after it taxied back to the gate.\n\n\u201cAnd the final irony of the climate protest on our flight. We cannot take off until we have taken on extra fuel...to replace the fuel used up during the protest, our pilot notes with humour,\u201d Watt tweeted.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said there is no law prohibiting a protester from buying a plane ticket.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between a security threat and a protest threat,\u201d he said.\n\nIn all, 50 protesters were arrested at London City Airport on Thursday, according to the BBC. Some had allegedly glued themselves to the floors and pavements while others blocked entrances. By the afternoon, police said most of the protesters had left the airport.", "description": "James Brown, an Irish\u00a0climate change protester who also happens to be a former paralympian, was arrested for climbing on top of a British Airways plane at London City Airport on Thursday,\u00a0the BBC reported.", "authors": ["Andrea Romano"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lhvqOOa0bx21j28RGN7T5w--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel.travelleisure.com/e0bc250b522849c2dddf52f65a00c4e5", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
