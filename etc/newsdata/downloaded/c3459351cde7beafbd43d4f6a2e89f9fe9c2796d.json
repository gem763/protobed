McDonald's claim they offer all staff guaranteed hours.\n\n\"Many workers have never been offered that, you have to qualify for it, and it's still at the manager's discretion.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. They are using it a smokescreen to cover up for the fact workers don't have the hours they need to put food on the table.\"\n\nA McDonald's spokesman said: \"We are extremely disappointed that a very small number of our people in just a handful of our restaurants are considering industrial action.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\"It is encouraging that there has been a steady decrease in the already small numbers of our people previously balloted.\n\n\"In October 2018, when activity was last planned, ultimately none of our people actually took action.\n\n\"As a growing and successful organisation we, along with our franchisees, will continue to invest in our people and create quality jobs and opportunities for all.\n\n\"We regularly review pay and benefits to ensure we are rewarding our people, and we pay well above the government minimum wage.\"", "description": "The 'McStrike' also calls for a guaranteed working hours and notice of shifts four weeks in advance", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Zuma Press Pa Images", "Pa Images", "Tass Via Getty Images", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727912.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BSE-McDonalds-Store.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
