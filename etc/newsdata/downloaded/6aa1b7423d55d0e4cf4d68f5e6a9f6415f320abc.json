And I don\u2019t want to overstep anyone\u2019s boundaries and make anyone feel left out\u2019.\n\nKim was the voice of reason (Picture: Reuters)\n\n\u2018Traveling with a family like this is a unique situation that not everybody does,\u2019 he went on to explain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I definitely think this trip, out of the other trips we\u2019ve been on, has a little bit more pressure. The truth of the matter is\u2026there are camera crews everywhere and tons of people walking around who Kourtney and I have known for over 10 years, but Sofia\u2019s never really done anything like this. So it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t want her to feel out of place and she\u2019s not as comfortable as I am. So I\u2019m just trying to be conscious of everybody\u2019s feelings\u2019.\n\nRiddled with worry, Scott ended up calling his ex-sister-in-law for advice.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s kind of weird,\u2019 he told Kim Kardashian. \u2018I\u2019m trying pay attention to everyone without neglecting anyone.\n\n\u2018Sofia mentioned to me that I\u2019m acting a little different around Kourtney. It\u2019s tough. Sometimes, Kourtney and I have so much history and have known each other for so long.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been trying to be mindful and not make Sofia uncomfortable, just because Kourt and I have known each other our whole lives.\n\n\u2018It puts so much stress on me and turns into me not being happy. I\u2019m not even fun to be around for anybody. I think this trip, out of the other trips we\u2019ve been on, has been a little more pressure because there are camera crews everywhere\u2019.\n\nThe pair patched things up (Picture: Keeping Up With The Kardashians)\n\nTo her credit, Kim sided with Sofia and encouraged her former brother-in-law to take her feelings in consideration \u2013 and reassure her that their relationship is important to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She seems like she\u2019s pretty cool with everything,\u2019 Kim told Scott during a phone call.\n\n\u2018So if she\u2019s speaking up about something that bothers her, you kind of have to pay attention and Kourtney, like, completely has to understand that\u2019.\n\nScott went on to confront Kourtney, telling her that all he wants is for both women to be comfortable. \u2018I want you to be comfortable, I want Sofia to be comfortable\u2019.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s [Sofia] always like\u2026you guys have your way\u2026and it\u2019s hard. She feels like she doesn\u2019t fit in sometimes. I haven\u2019t really had a second by myself to have a conversation and make her feel comfortable. She\u2019s never been in this life that we\u2019ve had for ten years. It\u2019s a lot. I\u2019m trying to juggle it, and being on camera is a lot for her\u2019.\n\nKourtney\u2019s response was understanding, and she told him: \u2018I think you put so much pressure on this to make it perfect,\u2019 she told him, referring to their joint holidays. \u2018I don\u2019t even mind if you guys go off and do your own thing,\u2019 she told him. \u2018I just feel like\u2026you\u2019re in it, then let\u2019s enjoy what\u2019s happening and make the most of it. If we\u2019re all going to do something, then let\u2019s be in the moment and have fun\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the conversation, Scott took Sofia away to have some time to themselves, and admitted that travelling together with his children, their mother, and his girlfriend was \u2018one of the best things\u2019 in his life.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
