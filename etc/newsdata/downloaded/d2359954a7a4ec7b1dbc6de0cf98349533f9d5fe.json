The free Wi-Fi will be available at Lyon, Parliament and Rideau stations, Watson said.\n\nUsers will have to log onto the Telus network to gain access, but don't need to be Telus customers.\n\nThe Wi-Fi will only be available on the platforms, but Watson said passengers will also be able to access cellular service in the tunnel using their own data plans.\n\nThe Wi-Fi service will \"help make our transit customer experience more convenient and more enjoyable,\" Watson said.\n\nOver the coming year, Telus will be adding free Wi-Fi service to all 13 Confederation Line stations. Watson didn't specify whether that will be extended to existing Trillium Line stations.\n\nProviding the free Wi-Fi is costing the city $2.6 million, while Telus is investing more than $10 million, according to John Manconi, Ottawa's general manager of transportation services.", "description": "Passengers on Ottawa's new Confederation Line will have access to free Wi-Fi at three underground stations when the LRT\u00a0opens Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5276183.1568046009!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ottawa-oc-transpo-o-train-confederation-line-lrt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
