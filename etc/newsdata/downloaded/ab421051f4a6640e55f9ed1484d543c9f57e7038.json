She said children tend to bite when they do not have the language to express their emotions.\n\n'Our findings resonate with other studies which have found an increase in the number of pre-school children with poor language skills,' she said.\n\n'Too much screen time and the pressures on working parents \u2013 which means they are not spending time talking to their children \u2013 have been blamed for the rise in children's problems communicating.\n\nThe warning came as a poll of nursery owners, managers and workers found that 27 per cent say they have seen a rise in the number of children biting in the past five years\n\nFamily life is so busy but it is vital parents take time to sit and chat with their children and read books to them so they develop good language skills at an early age.\n\n'Otherwise it is nurseries that have to pick up the slack.'\n\nMiss Learner highlighted a recent study by the Booktrust charity which found that some parents are using technology such as Amazon's Alexa, apps and video messaging to give their child a night-time story.\n\n'Reading books to your children and spending time talking to them builds their confidence and curiosity as well as their language and self-esteem,' she argued.\n\n'It is no wonder there is a rise in children biting at nursery due to them getting cross and frustrated over an inability to communicate as well as it being a cry for attention.'\n\nStella Ziolkowski, director of quality and training at the National Day Nurseries Association, said biting was part of children's development.\n\nShe agreed that it was a way for those who cannot talk to 'express difficult feelings such as anger, frustration or fear'.\n\nBut she added that babies and toddlers can also bite to help relieve teething pain, while some children may be imitating others, doing it to get attention or acting in self-defence.", "description": "The warning came as a poll of nursery owners, managers and workers found that 27 per cent say they have seen a rise in the number of children biting in the past five years.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19374788-0-image-a-27_1570403293742.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
