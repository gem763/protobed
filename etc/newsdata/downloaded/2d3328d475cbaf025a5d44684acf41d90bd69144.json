It was initially suspended in June, and then finally dropped earlier this week.\n\nIn the meantime, the protesters' demands had spiralled into calls for a much wider set of reforms.\n\nFour of their demands remain unmet:\n\nWithdrawal of the \"riot\" description used about the protests by the authorities\n\nAmnesty for all arrested protesters\n\nAn independent inquiry into alleged police brutality\n\nUniversal suffrage for the elections of the chief executive and Legislative Council, Hong Kong's parliament\n\nSome also want Hong Kong's embattled political leader, Carrie Lam, to resign, accusing her of being controlled by the mainland government in Beijing.\n\nBut the protests have sometimes turned violent.\n\nOn Saturday, some protesters attempted to gain access to the international airport, the site of previous demonstrations. But police only allowed airline passengers with a ticket to board trains and buses bound for the terminal.\n\nBy Saturday night, the situation had destabilised into running clashes between protesters and police, with tear gas being fired in the city - a common sight during the weeks of demonstrations.\n\nIs the US likely to get involved?\n\nThe appeal for US intervention comes despite President Donald Trump's characterisation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping as \"a great leader who very much has the respect of his people\".\n\n\"I have zero doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it,\" Mr Trump tweeted in mid-August.\n\nOn Saturday, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said China should show \"restraint\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence\n\nInstead of a crackdown, he urged Chinese authorities to \"to sit down and talk with the protesters and resolve the differences.\"\n\nFor its part, China has not only warned foreign powers not to interfere, but has outright accused the US and Britain of encouraging the protests.\n\nThe US State Department has issued a travel advisory for Americans visiting Hong Kong, warning that US citizens and diplomatic staff \"have been subject to a People's Republic of China propaganda campaign falsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong.\"", "description": "The protesters march near the US consulate general on the 14th straight weekend of demonstrations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mskyj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
