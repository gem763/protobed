It was a celebratory affair, complete with a reggae band, but for founder and chief executive Patrick Byrne, it held a tinge of melancholy.\n\nHe was about to resign, and not exactly by choice.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s chief financial officer had just informed the board of directors that Overstock could not renew its insurance policy as long as Byrne was in charge. The CEO\u2019s incessant broadcasting of his involvement in a \u201cdeep state\u201d investigation had irreparably linked his personal life with the public company. On Overstock letterhead the week before, he claimed that he had romanced a Russian agent at the urging of the \u201cMen in Black\u201d \u2014 his term for federal agents \u2014 and effectively inserted himself into an international political scandal.\n\nNow Overstock\u2019s insurance provider had concerns about the company\u2019s ability to \u201cmanage the CEO\u2019s personality and public comments,\u201d according to internal emails obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nIn his Aug. 22 resignation letter, dated two days after the anniversary party, Byrne said he\u2019d become ensnared in \u201ccertain government matters\u201d and that his \u201crabbi,\u201d Warren Buffett, had advised him to come clean to the American people. Later that day, Byrne appeared on Fox Business wearing a \u201cMake America Grateful Again\u201d hat and claimed a federal agent had offered him $1 billion to keep quiet.\n\nBut he was obligated to come forward because, he told Fox, \u201cThis country\u2019s gone nuts.\"\n\nByrne\u2019s resignation capped an unconventional and controversial two-decade run at Overstock.com, a billion-dollar retailer best known for moderately priced home goods. But the company that revolutionized furniture-buying to become one of the biggest successes in e-commerce was now reeling from a series of missteps and diversions, leaving it with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses. The company\u2019s flagship site had become an afterthought for Byrne, 56, who wanted desperately to sell it to focus on his cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest bombshell was Byrne\u2019s claims of entanglement with the FBI. In a corporate news release last month, Byrne said he had been assisting federal agents in their investigation of Russian election interference through his three-year relationship with Maria Butina, the accused Russian agent.\n\nOverstock shares fell 36 percent within days of the news release as anxious investors absorbed Byrne\u2019s accounts of political intrigue, espionage and, in his words, a \u201chandful of trysts\u201d with Butina. The board was losing patience, and its chair, Allison Abraham, had begun forwarding hate mail to him, he said. Abraham did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSoon Overstock\u2019s insurance carrier was expressing reservations about renewing its liability plan for directors and officers, a scenario that corporate insurance experts say is highly unusual.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of companies that are too toxic to touch, but for one individual to be a liability risk for the whole company? That\u2019s pretty extraordinary,\u201d said Dan Bailey, an Ohio-based lawyer who has been drafting such policies for more than 30 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen that before.\u201d\n\nInternally, executives explored whether they could get a policy that covered all directors and officers except Byrne. When it became clear they couldn\u2019t, Byrne says, he knew it was time to walk away.\n\n\u201cI figured that when one is having to parse finely what \u2018impossible\u2019 means when it comes to getting insurance, it was time to leave,\u201d said Byrne, who spoke to The Post by phone and through more than 80 emails over three weeks.\n\n***\n\nOverstock was designed to keep its shoppers guessing.\n\nThe site began as an online flea market where wholesalers could offload just about anything, including exercise machines, bedsheets and Star Wars figurines.\n\nThe company got its start in 1999, at the height of the dot-com boom, when Byrne took a $7 million stake in D2: Discounts Direct, an online outlet for excess inventory and relaunched it under the new banner. It grew rapidly: Annual revenue catapulted from $1.8 million in 1999 to $25.5 million in 2000. By 2002, the company saw $92 million in revenue and turned its first quarterly profit.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, Overstock revolutionized e-commerce,\u201d said Stormy Simon, who started working for the company in 2001 and was its president from 2013 to 2016. \u201cWe were the first to ship couches and huge rugs across the country. There wasn\u2019t a lot of competition \u2014 it was just us, Amazon and eBay.\"\n\nMany of the company\u2019s early practices have become standard in online shopping. Overstock was a pioneer in \u201cdrop shipping,\u201d in which companies cut out the middleman by allowing third-party vendors to ship directly to customers. Meanwhile, its Club O membership program \u2014 introduced in 2004, a year before Amazon Prime \u2014 allowed shoppers to pay a flat fee for a year\u2019s worth of free shipping. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Post.)\n\nBy the mid-2000s, though, new competitors emerged. Overstock moved to improve efficiency and invested heavily in updating its computer systems. But it ended 2005 with $25 million in the red. A year later, losses widened to $97 million.\n\nIts stock also was in free fall, shedding about 80 percent of its value from 2005 to 2007. Byrne attributed that decline to systematic problems on Wall Street, including naked short-selling, in which investors bet against a company\u2019s stock without having borrowed shares. It was all part of a wide-ranging Wall Street scheme, he told investors in a 2005 conference call, that involved \u201cmiscreant\u201d hedge funds, high-profile journalists and the SEC. He claimed someone called \u201cthe Easter Bunny\u201d had clued him in on the conspiracy, and that it was being overseen by a \u201cSith Lord,\u201d a reference to a Star Wars villain. (In later interviews, he compared the network of \u201cmiscreants\u201d to al-Qaeda.) Although the comments raised eyebrows, the company\u2019s board made no public effort to rein him in.\n\n\u201cI listened to that conference call with my jaw on the floor,\u201d said a former executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal affairs. \u201cBut of course nobody pushed back. Everyone was working for Patrick. It was his company, and that was it.\u201d\n\nByrne became more outspoken over time and sought a bigger platform. He started a website, DeepCapture.com, where he laid out his views and frequently took aim at former colleagues, journalists and hedge fund managers. (In a recent high-profile libel suit, a Canadian judge ordered Byrne and his site to pay nearly $1 million to a Vancouver businessman after DeepCapture accused him of being an arms dealer and terrorist.)\n\nBut the campaign also drove his billionaire father, John Byrne, to resign from Overstock\u2019s board. The man widely credited with rescuing Geico from bankruptcy in the 1970s said at the time that he disagreed with his son\u2019s \u201cjihad\u201d against Wall Street. (He rejoined the board four years later, saying his son had been \u201cright all along.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt became all about, \u2018I\u2019m going to take down Wall Street,' and that became more important than the business,\u201d said Simon, the former president. \u201cPatrick just didn\u2019t love retail after that.\"\n\nIn 2007, Byrne sued nearly a dozen major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, for $3.5 billion, alleging that a \u201cmassive, illegal stock market manipulation scheme\u201d had driven down Overstock\u2019s share price. Several of the banks settled out of court in 2010, for a collective $4.4 million. Merrill Lynch\u2019s case extended into 2016, when it agreed to a $20 million settlement. (He also collected a $5 million settlement from Rocker Partners, a hedge fund he claimed was manipulating the company\u2019s stock.)\n\n\u201cThe lawsuits ended successfully,\u201d a spokesman for Overstock said. \u201cAnd the regulatory changes advocated by Overstock lessened the debilitating consequences of the 2008 financial crisis to some of the largest banks in this county.\u201d That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned \u201cabusive naked short selling.\u201d\n\nByrne said he personally bankrolled the $30 million for his \u201cmitzvah with Wall Street,\u201d which former employees say began taking priority over the company. \u201cThe oligarchy picked a fight; I clubbed them like a little baby seal,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIt was an honor to be able to put that wealth to such good purpose.\u201d\n\nByrne\u2019s deep distrust of Wall Street lingered. Until a few years ago, the company kept $10 million in gold and silver coins, along with enough food to feed its employees for three months (the stockpile is now down to a few weeks). \u201cWhy? To make our firm robust in the face of a number of social ills that could beset our nation,\u201d Byrne said in an email to The Post.\n\nThe company also invested heavily in blockchain, the technology behind digital cryptocurrencies. It began accepting bitcoin in 2014, making it the first mainstream retailer to do so, and has continued to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Medici Ventures, its blockchain investment business, and tZero, its trading platform for digital coins. (That part of the business has been the subject of a years-long investigation by the SEC, though executives have said there has been no indication the agency plans to pursue legal action. The SEC declined to comment.)\n\nByrne has long confounded those around him. He has a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University and a black belt in taekwondo. Much of his world view, he has said, was shaped by three bouts with cancer, starting with a diagnosis of testicular cancer in his early 20s.\n\nInternally, Byrne was known for having grandiose plans and a short attention span, according to interviews with former employees and executives, and one former board member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the company candidly. Byrne relied heavily on an insular group of executives who referred to themselves as \u201ccoyotes\u201d and rarely challenged his views, several of them said.\n\nByrne left his mark on every part of the company: Its newest headquarters was designed to look like a peace sign from above, and like a \u201ccorporate version\u201d of the Roman Colosseum from ground level, according to a company release. He also helped create an internal voting system that allowed employees to weigh in on company decisions, such as whether Snoop Dogg should perform at the office or who should be fired.\n\nIn recent years, Byrne had been trying to sell Overstock\u2019s retail business, setting up meetings with Walmart, Target, Home Depot and the furniture rental company Aaron\u2019s, according to a person involved in the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were not public. Representatives for the four retailers declined to comment, as did Overstock.\n\nByrne said he had hoped to sell the retail business in an auction scheduled for March 8, 2018. But days earlier, the company disclosed that the SEC was investigating its blockchain business. Almost immediately, \u201ceverybody backed out,\u201d Byrne said, and the company was forced to put its plans on hold. Overstock has yet to find a buyer.\n\nMeanwhile, Byrne doubled down on bitcoin, pouring his ambitions and money into blockchain technology and start-ups \u2014 which is what led him to Maria Butina.\n\n***\n\nTheir story began at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.\n\nIt was 2015, and Byrne had just given a speech about cryptocurrency at FreedomFest, an annual meeting of libertarians that attracted such speakers as Donald Trump, Steve Forbes and Peter Thiel. He said he quickly noticed a \u201cstriking redheaded young woman\u201d waiting to speak with him.\n\nButina introduced herself as the president of a gun rights group in Russia and handed him her business card, Byrne wrote on DeepCapture.com. The next day, she approached him again, with a different card. This one identified her as a special assistant to the vice chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. \u201cDr. Byrne, please allow me to tell you why I am really here,\u201d she said, according to Byrne. \u201cI have been sent here to make contact with you.\"\n\nButina\u2019s attorney, Robert Driscoll, disputes Byrne\u2019s version of events: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t sent to the U.S. by anybody, and she certainly wasn\u2019t sent to the U.S. to make contact with Patrick,\u201d he said, though he confirmed that the two had a romantic relationship.\n\nByrne invited Butina to his hotel suite for a lunch meeting. Butina told him she was being groomed to become the next president of Russia, Byrne said, and invited him to Moscow to speak about bitcoin at the Russian Central Bank.\n\nByrne said he then contacted federal authorities and asked whether it would be okay to accept Butina\u2019s invitation to Russia. It took weeks, he said, to get an answer but eventually he received a \u201cgreen light\u201d telling him to move forward. He had no expectation that their relationship would turn romantic, but Butina \u201cswept me and my liberalism off my feet,\u201d he wrote on Deep Capture. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment.\n\nHe said they spent a weekend together in New York, then met up every so often in different parts of the country. It reminded him of \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d he said, referring to the 2003 film in which an aging actor played by Bill Murray and a recent college graduate played by Scarlett Johansson have a series of intimate meetings.\n\n\u201cWe had a handful of trysts like that,\u201d he told The Post in an email, \u201cspread across time, in the background of the normal narrative arc of her life.\u201d\n\nIn late 2015, he said, Butina told him she\u2019d been given orders to make contact with the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. (Driscoll disputes this.) Byrne said he reported this to \u201cthe Men in Black.\u201d\n\nTwo former FBI special agents deemed the claims improbable. It\u2019s unlikely, they said, that a highly trained foreign agent would have revealed her targets \u2014 in this case, as Byrne says, the four political campaigns \u2014 or that the FBI would have approved a romantic relationship as a means to collect intelligence.\n\nThey also dismissed Byrne\u2019s claims that his 2015 phone calls helped spearhead the massive investigation into Russian election interference that culminated in a sprawling, $32 million inquiry by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Byrne said he was never contacted by Mueller\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of steps it seems he\u2019s not aware of,\u201d said John Iannarelli, a retired FBI special agent, who called Byrne\u2019s claims \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cNothing he has said indicates that he understands how procedures operate.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why Butina might have revealed her alleged orders, Byrne said she did so while she was \u201cheavily \u2018under the influence\u2019\u201d of \u201clarge quantities\u201d of serotonin, oxytocin and dopamine \u2014 the brain chemicals that spark feelings of love and attraction.\n\nByrne claims his history with the FBI dates back to 2002, when his friend and former NBA player Bison Dele disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. Byrne wrote on Deep Capture that he had a \u201cminor involvement in helping the authorities sort it out.\u201d (Dele has never been found; authorities believe he and two others were killed by his brother.)\n\nAs for Butina, Byrne said that he was under the impression he was receiving orders from top FBI officials. Six months into the relationship, Byrne said, the bureau asked him to break up with her. And he did \u2014 by text.\n\nSoon though, Byrne says, the \u201cMen in Black\u201d returned with another request: \u201cThey wanted to ask me to rekindle a romantic relationship with Maria Butina,\u201d he wrote on DeepCapture. \u201cRussia was trying to subvert our election, and I was to get to the bottom of Maria Butina. \u2018Gloves off.\u2019\u201d\n\nByrne says he obliged, setting off a chain of events that led to his departure.\n\n***\n\nByrne is out \u2014 but the turmoil at Overstock remains.\n\nOn Monday, the company revised down its earnings forecast for the year \u2014 in part because of \u201csignificantly\u201d higher insurance costs for directors and officers \u2014 and announced that its chief financial officer had resigned. Its share price has tumbled about 20 percent this week.\n\nFormer employees say Overstock\u2019s retail site has become overly dependent on sweeping discounts and antiquated ideas. They expressed doubts that the new CEO, Jonathan Johnson, a company veteran who most recently led Overstock\u2019s blockchain arm, would be able to steer the business in a new direction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been shoulder-to-shoulder with Patrick for 17 years,\u201d Johnson, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Utah as a Republican in 2016, said in an interview. \u201cIf Patrick\u2019s the architect, I\u2019m the builder.\u201d\n\nIn practical terms, Johnson says, that means Overstock.com \u2014 synonymous for many with bed frames and bath towels \u2014 could soon become solely a blockchain company. \u201cIf the right fit comes along at the right price, well, we could find another home for retail,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company\u2019s e-commerce business has faced mounting competition in recent years, not just from rival websites, but also more traditional retailers like Walmart and Target that are doubling down on home goods and furniture. Overstock\u2019s largest competitor \u2014 and the one that seemed to most vex its executives \u2014 was Wayfair, a company that regularly posts hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses but has attracted large-scale venture capital funding and has eclipsed Overstock in revenue and market share. Last year, Wayfair posted a loss of $504 million, more than double Overstock\u2019s $218 million loss.\n\nWayfair\u2019s growing market share, former executives said, was a frequent source of tension within Overstock. And although Byrne\u2019s departure may have helped the e-commerce giant insure its executives in the short term, they say they\u2019re still worried about the company\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\n\u201cYou look at it now, and the retail business just isn\u2019t loved anymore,\u201d Simon said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to feed the baby, you should at least give it up for adoption.\u201d\n\n***\n\nByrne is now on an island in Asia, he says, waiting for the whole thing to blow over. He says he has a duty to distance himself \u2014 both physically and financially \u2014 from the company he started 20 years ago.\n\nHe has gold and silver reserves in Switzerland, though he is becoming worried about \u201cthe deteriorating world situation.\u201d Last week he sold his entire stake in Overstock \u2014 worth $90 million \u2014 and is reinvesting some of it in gold, silver and two types of cryptocurrencies, to shield his fortune from \u201cacts of retaliation from the Deep State.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is important because, in fact, I am now going to shellac them,\u201d he wrote on his blog. \u201cActually, \u2018shellac\u2019 is too weak a word for what I intend to do to the Deep State. Sit back and enjoy the show.\u201d", "description": "Insurers worried the retailer could not rein in Patrick Byrne\u2019s personality and public comments.
