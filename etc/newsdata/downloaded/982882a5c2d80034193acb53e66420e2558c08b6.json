Valuation of the company dropped to around $5bn- $10bn, less than a quarter of the $47bn originally envisioned.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, WeWork is expected to wait until mid-October \u201cat the earliest\u201d to start its investor roadshow. Softbank, its largest investor, reportedly wants the share offering pushed back further.\n\nWeWork is in a bind: it must launch its IPO by the end of the year if it is to qualify for the $6bn loan it needs to fund an aggressive expansion program. On Tuesday, the value of WeWork bonds fell, on concerns that $3bn it hoped to raise through the stock market offering may no longer be forthcoming.\n\nFor SoftBank\u2019s Son, whose estimated net worth is $23bn, the failure of WeWork comes uncomfortably soon after Uber, another loss-making SoftBank investment, went public.\n\nThe Vision Fund reportedly lost some $600m on its investment in Uber when the ride-share company\u2019s shares declined after it was floated in New York. An investment in the workplace-chat app Slack has also underperformed. Shares dropped 30% after going public in June.\n\nWhen it launched in 2017, the $100bn mega-fund was supposed to change tech investment. It would dish out installments of at least $100m, allowing tech companies to remain privately held for longer periods and then come to market at stratospheric valuations.\n\nVision Fund amassed a formidable portfolio of about 80 investments in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, e-commerce, transportation and healthcare.\n\nUber\u2019s disappointments and WeWork\u2019s chaotic path may make it far more difficult for Softbank to raise money for a $108bn fund, Vision Fund II, meant to pump further capital into tech.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which contributed $45bn to the Vision Fund, is planning to limit its exposure by only placing profits from that investment into the successor, while Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Investment, which invested $15bn, is considering limiting future investment to less than $10bn.\n\nThat still leaves an odd consortium of investors, including Apple, Goldman Sachs and the government of Kazakhstan.\n\nSoftbank is reported to be in talks with Microsoft, and reportedly told it it would push the companies in its fund to shift from the Amazon cloud platform to Microsoft.", "description": "Failure of WeWork comes soon after Uber, another loss-making SoftBank investment, went public", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b7f3f972fc11e3f92a48702238fc393dbaee1d3/0_122_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=157e84dbb7928d6d1b30d42551bd4509", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
