Investigators alleged at least three of the men were linked to a group known as the \u201cjuggboyy crew.\u201d\n\nPolice said that fingerprints of two of the suspects were found inside a stolen Honda Pilot, and fingerprints of one of those two men were found on the outside of a stolen Ford F-150 pickup truck.\n\nOther clues, according to the affidavits, included social media communications, records showing the use of at least two credit cards stolen from cars, and home surveillance videos that captured suspicious activity outside of cars.\n\nIt was not clear from the affidavits exactly why the cars were stolen. Several were found parked in a neighborhood in SE Washington near where at least one suspect lived.\n\nMontgomery officials identified the four men as:\n\n\n\nFrom left to right, Khristian Markeel Champ, Duan Jones and Christopher Taylor. (Montgomery County Police)\n\nChristopher Taylor, 19, who was charged with six counts of auto theft and multiple counts related to allegedly rifling through cars or taking items from cars.\n\nKhristian Markeel Champ, 20, who was charged with five counts of auto theft and other counts related to allegedly rifling through cars or taking items from cars.\n\nAlaunte Scott, 18, who was charged with one count of auto theft and six other counts.\n\nDuan Jones, 20, who was charged with three counts of theft less than $100, one count of theft of $100-$1,500, and 14 counts of \u201cRogue and Vagabond\u201d related to instances when he allegedly broke into cars but did not necessarily take anything.\n\nIn a news release Tuesday, Montgomery police said investigators believe the four worked together and may be linked to approximately 30 auto thefts and approximately 100 instances of break-ins of cars.\n\nJones is being represented by the public defender\u2019s office in Montgomery County. A supervising attorney there, Leonard Addison, declined to comment Wednesday. Court records for the other three suspects do not indicate whether any have retained attorneys.\n\nNone of the suspects could be reached for comment Wednesday. Two relatives for Champ spoke briefly by phone but declined to be named. \u201cThese are just allegations,\u201d Champ\u2019s grandmother said.\n\nRelatives for the other suspects could not be reached for comment.\n\nJones, Champ, and Taylor were arrested in recent weeks and have since posted bonds and been released from the Montgomery County jail, according to court records. Police said Scott is the subject of a District Court summons charging him with one count of auto theft and other counts.\n\nCorrection: This report has been corrected. Three suspects were arrested in the case, not four as the previous headline and story stated. The fourth suspect charged in the case was the subject of a summons. One of the suspects was charged with theft from a vehicle but was not charged with auto theft, as the earlier story stated. The three suspects charged with auto theft were charged with stealing no more than six vehicles. A previous version said charges involved 30 auto thefts and 100 thefts from cars.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Montgomery County Police allege several stolen cars were found on the same street in Washington.", "authors": ["Dan Morse", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Crime In Montgomery County", "Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5KZM_cDFmxfMSusbVhrOyMNr0UI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/THGMGEXKRYI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
