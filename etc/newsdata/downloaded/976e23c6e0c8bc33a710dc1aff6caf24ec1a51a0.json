While CBA has said systems have now returned to normal, customers are still reporting problems.\n\nThe outage occurred around the afternoon on October 17, according to DownDetector, with people reporting they were unable to pay for items, transfer money or receive payments from employers. Some customers alleged they had to leave trolleys of shopping goods behind as their cards would not process payments.\n\nCBA issued a tweet stating services had returned to normal by 6am on October 18 but that there was a backlog of payments to process, which would cause delay for some. Other services being affected included:\n\nSome debit card payments may be impacted\n\nCommBank app and NetBank payments\n\nBPAY services including PAY-ID payments\n\nCardless Cash and Cardless Deposits not available\n\nSome in-branch services\n\nSome call centre services\n\nProcessing of some CommBiz payments\n\n(1/3 ) Update 6AM: We've been working to restore the network systems overnight and they are now returning to normal. Some payments may be delayed. We're working through these as quickly as possible. All payments both in to and out of customer accounts will be properly processed. \u2014 CommBank (@CommBank) October 17, 2019\n\nBut by 2.15pm, CBA released another statement that services were still being delayed and that CBA customers would be treated as a priority.\n\nUpdate 2.15PM: Our services continue to operate as normal. We are working through the backlog of payments as quickly as possible and rest assured that all payments both into and out of customer accounts are being processed as a priority.

CBA has yet to provide details on what caused the issue but has referred to \"internal system issues related to an upgrade implemented on Thursday.\"\n\nIf you're not a customer with CBA and you're still being affected by the outage, CBA recommends contacting your own bank. Other banks, such as ING, however, recommend dealing with CBA directly.\n\nWe are unable to expedite funds being cleared into the account, if they are not showing in your account this means they have not come through to us yet. Should you require funds urgently you will need to refer back to CBA as the outage is from their end. ^Victoria \u2014 ING Australia (@ING_Aust) October 18, 2019\n\nWhile the situation is finally being resolved after a wild 24 hours for some Australians, it's interesting to see how these sorts of outages will affect the future as physical cash moves further into the obsolete.", "description": "A major Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) outage on October 17 left millions of Australians around the country unable to transfer or receive money while other bank customers also felt the impact.
