It took almost two months for anyone to notice.", "language": "en", "text": "But on Monday, police finally made it to the Sonoda dorm at the suburban campus outside Christchurch, New Zealand, where authorities discovered the body of a first-year student, local media reported. The student\u2019s father, who could not reach the young man through his friends, had also contacted police.\n\nThe young man\u2019s body had gone untouched for so long that police had to call in a special team to examine fingerprints, DNA and dental records so they could confirm his identity, Detective Senior Sgt. Craig Johnson told reporters. Most details surrounding the incident, including the student\u2019s name and age, had not been made public as of early Wednesday, and the coroner is still investigating the cause of death.\n\nAmid an outcry from university students that\u2019s gone all the way up to New Zealand\u2019s education minister this week, a university is grappling with a grim question: How could a dead student go undiscovered for so long?\n\nFor now, no one really seems to know.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable to imagine how these circumstances could have occurred,\u201d Cheryl de la Rey, the university\u2019s vice chancellor, said in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\nDe la Rey said Wednesday that the university will commission an independent investigation to examine the oversight, despite what she called an \u201cextensive\u201d well-being program to support students.\n\nShe declined to comment further to respect the family of the student. \u201cThis is an extremely distressing time for University students and staff,\u201d de la Rey said.\n\nA friend of the student\u2019s told the Press, a Christchurch newspaper, that he was a \u201cgood and confident guy\u201d who would sometimes \u201cgo off the grid for a week or so.\"\n\nThe Sonoda dorm, a leafy complex surrounded by cherry blossoms and tennis courts that houses first-year students, is one of six that\u2019s owned by the university but managed by Campus Living Villages, an Australian company that also oversees student housing in the United States and United Kingdom. Students pay more than $10,000 a year for a single-occupancy room in the \u201csmaller close-knit community,\u201d which has just 108 beds, split across five-person apartments, as well as a cafeteria serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, according to its website. The dorm employs two resident assistants as well as a manager, the university said, and Campus Living Villages meets with the university every two weeks to discuss \u201cstudents of concern.\u201d\n\nChris Hipkins, New Zealand\u2019s education minister, called on the university to \u201cconduct a thorough investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going into a hall of residence or a hostel, you are paying top dollar for not just a roof over your head but also the pastoral care that goes with that,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd I think clearly that\u2019s not been present in this case.\u201d\n\nSam Brosnahan, the University of Canterbury\u2019s student body president, said the death had distressed students on the usually peaceful campus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally well regarded by students as a safe place to learn, study and live,\u201d he told the AP.\n\nBut Bex Bryan, a former resident adviser at the university, said in a Facebook post she found it \u201cunbelievable\u201d it took so long to find the dead student. She had daily contact with students, planned weekend activities and knew who was away when.\n\nThe dorms \u201chave certainly taken a dive since my days,\u201d she said, \u201cevidenced by the litter and general behaviour of students there at night.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand police say they are investigating the student's death, and the University of Canterbury said it will commission an independent investigation.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YUVs2L1ayz1OwzChrkTcaGHqy2A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D7XK63W7LEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
