Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) advanced more than 3.4%.\n\nFrom a stock perspective, the supply disruptions should put a bid into U.S. energy stocks, which have meaningfully lagged the broader market, JPM analysts wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we could see a positive move in the oily small and mid-cap group,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy .SPNY sector's 5.6% rise this year was much below the 20% climb for broader S&P 500 .SPX.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of airlines and cruise line operators dropped in anticipation of higher fuel costs.
