And to be honest, the briefings had become a lot of theater, and I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Grisham argued that journalists writing books are part of the problem, asserting that \u201cthey\u2019re all getting famous off of this presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so, I think it\u2019s great what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d she added.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary: Trump ended press briefings because reporters \"weren't being good to his people. He doesn't like that. He is very loyal to his people and he put a stop to it.\" pic.twitter.com/Z0OaK6kM2D \u2014 Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) September 23, 2019\n\nGrisham has yet to hold a traditional briefing, a practice which effectively ended under her predecessor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who left the post in June.\n\nDuring her tenure, Sanders was known to opt instead for appearances on Fox News where she now works as a contributor.\n\nIn an August interview with Sinclair Broadcasting Group\u2019s \u201cAmerica This Week,\u201d Grisham indicated the briefings could return but that it would ultimately be up to President Donald Trump to make the call.\n\nIn an effort to justify the decision in her latest remarks, Grisham contended that the briefings were intended to provide a space for Trump\u2019s spokesperson to \u201cspeak to his policies and get his message out there,\u201d stating that reporters \u201cweren\u2019t being good to his people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t like that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it.\u201d\n\nIn a January tweet, Trump unleashed one of his routine attacks against the media, stating that Sanders hadn\u2019t visited the podium much because \u201cthe press covers her so rudely & inaccurately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe administration has pointed to Trump\u2019s face-to-face interactions with reporters while preparing to board Marine One, for example.\n\nHowever, as Olivier Knox, then-president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, told The New York Times, the on-the-go talks aren\u2019t a substitute for daily briefings.\n\n\u201cWhile other avenues exist to obtain information, the robust, public back-and-forth we\u2019ve come to expect in the James S. Brady briefing room helps highlight that no one in a healthy republic is above being questioned,\u201d he said in January. \u201cThis retreat from transparency and accountability sets a terrible precedent.\u201d", "description": "The press secretary said the daily briefings won't be back soon because reporters \"weren\u2019t being good to\" Trump's \"people.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f8b32300009705d61376.jpeg?cache=qckbcfniuq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
