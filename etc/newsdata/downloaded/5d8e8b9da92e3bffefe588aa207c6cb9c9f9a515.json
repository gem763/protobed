She crashed near a highway on-ramp and was arrested. A man traveling with her escaped, Silva said.\n\n\"The arresting officers saw she was on parole and was driving on a revoked driver's license,\" Silva said.\n\nLast year, Sanchez was sentenced to six years and four months in prison for driving under the influence and gross vehicular manslaughter after her 14-year-old sister Jacqueline died in the 2017 crash.\n\nProsecutors said Sanchez was livestreaming on Instagram while driving when she crashed. The video showed her taking her hands off the steering wheel.\n\nObdulia Sanchez's mugshot was released by Stockton Police Department\n\nThe car driven by Sanchez veered onto the shoulder of a road in Los Banos, about 100 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nAuthorities say she overcorrected, causing the vehicle to swerve and overturn, ejecting and killing Jacqueline.\n\nSanchez, who had a blood alcohol level of 0.1 per cent according to Merced County District Attorney Harold Nutt and hospital records, lost control of the car outside Los Banos and sent it crashing through a fence, at which point Jacqueline went flying out the back window.\n\nThat is when Sanchez made the decision to get her phone and begin livestreaming once again, capturing her bloodied sister as she died.\n\nShe was seen in a field near the crashed vehicle, looking into the camera and saying: 'Everybody, if I go to ... jail for life you already know why.'\n\nJacqueline was seen lifeless on the ground with clear signs of head trauma.\n\n'My sister is \u2026 dying. Look ... I ... love my sister to death,' Sanchez continued, adding: 'Jacqueline, please wake up.'\n\nJacqueline Sanchez (above) was killed when she was thrown out the window of her sister's car in a 2017 crash\n\nObdulia Sanchez in the livestream video moments before the crash\n\nShe then started kissing her sister's face.\n\n'I f**king love my sister to death. I don't give a f**k. We about to die. This is the last thing I wanted to happen to us but it just did,' said Sanchez, who also had blood covering her face.\n\nSanchez later explained to police that even though she was livestreaming, she did stop the video twice to call 911 and get help.\n\nDuring one of those calls, Sanchez said to the operator: 'Can you come pick up my sister, she is f**king dead. Man, I just crashed and I was DUI . Can you please come pick us up?'\n\nObdulia Sanchez (pictured in court in 2017), had been released on parole after serving 26 months in prison for driving drunk while livestreaming the crash that killed her sister\n\nAt her sentencing in February, Sanchez said: 'I'm so sorry, if I could take her place, I would. My negligence killed my sister. I was stupid, immature, and irresponsible.'\n\nShe was released from prison last month after serving two years and two months.\n\nState corrections department spokeswoman Terri Hardy said Sanchez received credit for the time she spent in jail before she was sentenced. Her sentence was also reduced under California law for good behavior with credits for various rehabilitation programs.", "description": "Obdulia Sanchez, 20, was arrested on weapons and traffic charges and a parole violation.
