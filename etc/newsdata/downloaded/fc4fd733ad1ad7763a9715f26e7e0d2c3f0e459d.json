So far, Gaines has dropped $100 on an assortment of fruity flavors like Apple Twist and Amazing Mango. Her collection should last eight months.\n\n\"I've gotten sinus infections and walking pneumonia from smoking cigarettes. I tried to quit many times using nicotine products such as the patch and gum and was never able to do so until I started vaping. I have never gotten sick from vaping,\" Gaines said. \"I believe the Trump administration's ban on flavored e-liquids and cartridges is ridiculous and unnecessary.\"", "description": "The great \"vapocalypse\" has begun and the horsemen leading the charge are from New York and Michigan.", "authors": ["Fernando Alfonso Iii"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920110029-vape-stockpiling-legislation-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
