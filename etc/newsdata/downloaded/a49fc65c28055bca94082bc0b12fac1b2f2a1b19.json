He was outraged after he learned Aug. 23 that China had formalized plans to slap duties on $75 billion in U.S. products in response to new tariffs from Washington on Sept. 1.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer then enlisted multiple CEOs to call Trump and warn him about the impact such a move would have on the stock market and the economy.\n\nHe settled on a 5% hike in tariff rates on about $550 billion in Chinese products, which he announced in an Aug. 23 tweet after the market close.\n\nIn the following days, both Mnuchin and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump's only regret was not raising tariffs higher.\n\nEarlier this month, Mnuchin said the U.S. and China have a \"conceptual\" agreement on enforcement concerns, emphasizing positive progress already made in trade talks, which are set to resume at high levels next month.\n\n\"I think the enforcement area we at least have a conceptual, an agreement on,\" Mnuchin told Fox Business Network.\n\nHe also had a warning: President Donald Trump has no problem keeping heavy tariffs on Beijing if a deal can't be reached.\n\nCNBC'S Kayla Tausche and Kevin Breuninger and Reuters contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump tweeted he will delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15.", "authors": ["Riya Bhattacharjee Chris Eudaily", "Riya Bhattacharjee", "Chris Eudaily"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105996877-1561983966425gettyimages-1152690137.jpeg?v=1561983997", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
