More than 14% said they have been penalised by a retailer for their returns behaviour, from warning emails to account deactivations.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBack in April, fashion retailer Asos announced it had changed its refunds policy to block such offenders .\n\nIn a list of sweeping changes, the clothing behemoth said it had extended its returns period - up from 28 days to 45 to allow customers to try on clothes and decide if they wish to keep them.\n\nBut alongside the changes, it added that a crackdown on fraud is underway - meaning customers who regularly buy items to wear once then return - might now be considered suspicious and refused a refund.\n\nIn an email sent out to customers, the brand said: \"We know easy returns are one of the (many) reasons you shop with us, so we've increased the time you can return stuff from 28 days to 45 days.\n\n\"If you return anything within 28 days, we\u2019ll refund you as normal\u2026 and after that (up to 45 days), you\u2019ll now get an Asos gift voucher for the amount you spent.\n\n\"We also need to make sure our returns remain sustainable for us and for the environment, so if we notice an unusual pattern, we might investigate and take action. It\u2019s unlikely to affect you, but we wanted to give you a heads up.\n\n\"If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn't sit right: e.g. we suspect someone is actually wearing their purchases and then returning them or ordering and returning loads \u2013 way, waaay more than even the most loyal Asos customer would order \u2013 then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated accounts.\"\n\nAnd if you're caught, you could have your access or account blocked.", "description": "The woman would routinely buy clothes, take the tags off, and then put them on older, used items, which she'd then return", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Lightrocket", "Reuters", "Getty", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9628827.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Zara-store-entrance-in-Eaton-Center-The-company-is-a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
