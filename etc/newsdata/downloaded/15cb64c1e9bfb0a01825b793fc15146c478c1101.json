The Domestic Abuse Bill was one of those lost when Parliament closed in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n\nLost bills can be reintroduced in the Queen's Speech, setting out the government's agenda, but all progress made so far in Parliament is undone.", "description": "Previous legislation was dropped when the prime minister suspended Parliament for five weeks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/65C8/production/_105265062_gettyimages-847527860_crop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
