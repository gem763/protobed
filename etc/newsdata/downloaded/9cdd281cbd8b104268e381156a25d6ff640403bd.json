What I discovered absolutely shocked me.\n\nYes, her normally shabby, cluttered apartment was looking strikingly stylish and modern\u2026 but it was her throw-away comment \u201cyeah, I did it all using Bumble\u201d that really stopped me in my tracks.\n\nWait, rewind. I\u2019m only new to the dating app scene myself, but the last time I checked, Bumble wasn\u2019t a trades and renovators delight\u2026 or maybe I just hadn\u2019t been reading between the lines like Lucy had. Or the second line to be more precise\u2026 that part under their name where it says what they do for a living.\n\nUpon further investigation, it seems my innocent and scattered (in a lovable way) friend Lucy had struck a very clever little gold mine indeed.\n\nAs a fellow single mama, with two kids under the age of 10, and a part time job in the beauty industry, Lucy didn\u2019t exactly have the cash or the know-how to get basic jobs done around her house; simple things, like fixing her shower for instance\u2026 which, as it turns out, was exactly how Lucy\u2019s clever little hack had first found its roots (so to speak).\n\n\u201cIt was my second date with a really cute builder called Luke (we shall simply call him the Builder) that I offered to cook dinner for him at my place\u201d says Lucy as I settle in for a really juicy afternoon.\n\n\u201cAfter dinner, and a bit of canoodling, the Builder excused himself to use the bathroom. When he returned, he mentioned that my shower was leaking.\"\n\nThis sassy mama was fixed up in more ways than one!\n\nThe light bulb (or leaky shower) moment\n\n\u201cYeah, I need to get that fixed, I just can\u2019t afford to get a plumber in\u201d she casually responded.\n\n\u201cNo more than five minutes later, the Builder had leapt to the rescue and repaired my leaking shower, along with replacing the washers on my taps,\" Lucy explains.\n\nNeedless to say, the two of them spent the evening focusing on the rest of Lucy\u2019s ahem, plumbing\u2026.\n\nA few days later, Lucy says she was smiling to herself in her newly-repaired shower, reminiscing how handy that had been to have The Builder do the jobs for free.\n\nLater that evening, Lucy was scrolling through Bumble and a dark haired, blue eyed guy called Jack caught her eye.\n\nWe shall call him the Electrician.\n\nA week later, and what do you know, Lucy\u2019s downlights have all been replaced and the Electrician had also found Lucy\u2019s hidden switch (yes, irresistible pun intended).\n\nLucy is one switched one woman - pardon the pun... Source: iStock\n\nShe was onto something...\n\nAnd so, over the course of the next six months, without mentioning a word to her friends of her brilliant new skills in \u201conline trading\u201d Lucy managed to get her gas fireplace connected, her balcony railing repaired, most of her apartment repainted, a Freedom Furniture lounge and desk assembled, her stereo surround sound hooked up and even her TV mounted, among other things.\n\nNow, I had to ask myself if this was in some ways bordering on modern day prostitution?\n\nBut Lucy insists that she sleeps at night with a smile on her face (oh, I bet she does) because she dates these blokes first and foremost because she actually fancies them.\n\nSecondly, she doesn\u2019t actually sleep with all of them, if that spark doesn\u2019t turn out to be there in person.\n\nAnd thirdly, Lucy believes it\u2019s actually a fair trade\u2026 she cooks them dinner, they do their bit to help out, she needs a hand with these jobs and they genuinely like to feel needed.\n\nShe also points out that she never bluntly asks them to do the jobs, she has just been really clever at dropping hints and playing the damsel in distress.\n\nSure, the penny may actually drop when they volunteer to help out around the house and Lucy suddenly pulls out a giant tool box with the exact repair tools required for the job to be completed on the spot.\n\nAs far as Lucy is concerned - everyone is a winner!\n\nBut so far no one\u2019s been offended and certainly no one is getting hurt\n\nAfterall, Lucy says \u201cblokes have been getting exactly what they want from dates forever and they never feel guilty about it.\u201d In her eyes, it\u2019s just a case of one woman getting what she wants out of the transaction too.\n\nJust when I was thinking Lucy should be nominated for Australian Woman of the Year, she shocks me further.\n\nA month ago, Lucy realised her car was due for rego. Which also meant it would need a service. Ordinarily, Lucy\u2019s old BMW would cost her around $1,000 for a full service and registration renewal. What to do?\n\nLet\u2019s just say that Brad the Mechanic didn\u2019t know what hit him. And neither did Neill when Lucy\u2019s tax return needed some attention in July. Oh, and then there was Matt the Physiotherapist when she hurt her shoulder at the gym. This girl was on a roll!\n\nNot only was Lucy going on great dates and being entrepreneurial at the same time, but she was also saving a pretty penny.\n\nShe's saved $10K!\n\nI asked her how much money she estimated she had \u201csaved\u201d all up over the past six months. Between the builder, plumber, decker, painter, electrician, cabinet-maker, mechanic, accountant and physio Lucy had guessed she had saved roughly $10,000.\n\n\u201cWas there no limit?\u201d I exclaimed in amazement after Lucy\u2019s last admission.\n\n\u201cWell yes\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cI would never date a gynaecologist, because that would just be weird.\u201d\n\nHmmmn, I guess you have to draw the line somewhere, I nodded in agreement, as I opened my Bumble account and took a much closer look at my recent matches.", "description": "\"When I went over for a coffee - her normally shabby, cluttered apartment was looking strikingly stylish and modern.\"", "authors": ["Rosie Jacobs"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c1358f12d5e3ee9ff28b33acc4a71f58", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
