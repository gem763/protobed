The 2014 movie Heaven Is for Real, about a young boy who told his parents he had visited heaven while he was having emergency surgery, grossed a respectable $91 million in the United States. The book it was based on, published in 2010, has sold some 10 million copies and spent 206 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Two recent books by doctors\u2014Proof of Heaven, by Eben Alexander, who writes about a near-death experience he had while in a week-long coma brought on by meningitis, and To Heaven and Back, by Mary C. Neal, who had her NDE while submerged in a river after a kayaking accident\u2014have spent 94 and 36 weeks, respectively, on the list. (The subject of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, published in 2010, recently admitted that he made it all up.) Their stories are similar to those told in dozens if not hundreds of books and in thousands of interviews with \u201cNDErs,\u201d or \u201cexperiencers,\u201d as they call themselves, in the past few decades. Though details and descriptions vary across cultures, the overall tenor of the experience is remarkably similar. Western near-death experiences are the most studied. Many of these stories relate the sensation of floating up and viewing the scene around one\u2019s unconscious body; spending time in a beautiful, otherworldly realm; meeting spiritual beings (some call them angels) and a loving presence that some call God; encountering long-lost relatives or friends; recalling scenes from one\u2019s life; feeling a sense of connectedness to all creation as well as a sense of overwhelming, transcendent love; and finally being called, reluctantly, away from the magical realm and back into one\u2019s own body. Many NDErs report that their experience did not feel like a dream or a hallucination but was, as they often describe it, \u201cmore real than real life.\u201d They are profoundly changed afterward, and tend to have trouble fitting back into everyday life. Some embark on radical career shifts or leave their spouses.\n\nOver time, the scientific literature that attempts to explain NDEs as the result of physical changes in a stressed or dying brain has also, commensurately, grown. The causes posited include an oxygen shortage, imperfect anesthesia, and the body\u2019s neurochemical responses to trauma. NDErs dismiss these explanations as inadequate. The medical conditions under which NDEs happen, they say, are too varied to explain a phenomenon that seems so widespread and consistent. Recent books by Sam Parnia and Pim van Lommel, both physicians, describe studies published in peer-reviewed journals that attempt to pin down what happens during NDEs under controlled experimental conditions. Parnia and his colleagues published results from the latest such study, involving more than 2,000 cardiac-arrest patients, in October. And the recent books by Mary Neal and Eben Alexander recounting their own NDEs have lent the spiritual view of them a new outward respectability. Mary Neal was, a few years before her NDE, the director of spinal surgery at the University of Southern California (she is now in private practice). Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon who taught and practiced at several prestigious hospitals and medical schools, including Brigham and Women\u2019s and Harvard. It was Alexander who really upped the scientific stakes. He studied his own medical charts and came to the conclusion that he was in such a deep coma during his NDE, and his brain was so completely shut down, that the only way to explain what he felt and saw was that his soul had indeed detached from his body and gone on a trip to another world, and that angels, God, and the afterlife are all as real as can be.\n\nAlexander has not published his medical findings about himself in any peer-reviewed journal, and a 2013 investigative article in Esquire questioned several details of his account, among them the crucial claim that his experience took place while his brain was incapable of any activity. To the skeptics, his story and the recent recanting of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven are just further evidence that NDEs rank right up there with alien abductions, psychic powers, and poltergeists as fodder for charlatans looking to gull the ignorant and suggestible. Yet even these skeptics rarely accuse experiencers of inventing their stories from whole cloth. Though some of these stories may be fabrications, and more no doubt become embellished in the retelling, they\u2019re too numerous and well documented to be dismissed altogether. It\u2019s also hard to ignore the accounts by respected physicians with professional reputations to protect. Even if the afterlife isn\u2019t real, the sensations of having been there certainly are. There is something about NDEs that makes them scientifically intriguing. While you can\u2019t rely on an alien abduction or a spiritual visitation taking place just when you\u2019ve got recording instruments handy, many NDEs happen when a person is surrounded by an arsenal of devices designed to measure every single thing about the body that human ingenuity has made us capable of measuring. The hero\u2019s journey is so pervasive in storytelling because it is so aspirational. It offers the possibility of escape and transformation. What\u2019s more, as medical technology continues to improve, it\u2019s bringing people back from ever closer to the brink of death. A small, lucky handful of people have made full or nearly full recoveries after spending hours with no breath or pulse, buried in snow or submerged in very cold water. Surgeons sometimes create these conditions intentionally, chilling patients\u2019 bodies or stopping their hearts in order to perform complex, dangerous operations; recently they have begun trying out such techniques on severely injured trauma victims, keeping them between life and death until their wounds can be repaired.\n\nAll of this makes NDEs perhaps the only spiritual experience that we have a chance of investigating in a truly thorough, scientific way. It makes them a vehicle for exploring the ancient human belief that we are more than meat. And it makes them a lens through which to peer at the workings of consciousness\u2014one of the great mysteries of human existence, even for the most resolute materialist. Which is how I found myself last summer in Newport Beach, California, at the annual conference of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS), which has been a formal organization since 1981. I wanted to know: What makes a person start believing that he has truly seen the other side? Why does one person\u2019s other side look so similar to so many other people\u2019s? And is there a way for science to get at what\u2019s really going on?\n\nThe conference had the joyous, clubby atmosphere of a reunion; many of the people had clearly known one another for years. Attendees wore strips of ribbon in different colors bearing legends such as SPEAKER, PANELIST, VOLUNTEER, and, for those who have had a near-death experience, EXPERIENCER. The program included panels and workshops on everything from \u201cWhat Medical Neuroscience Can Learn From NDEs\u201d to \u201cSacred Geometry Dance: Creating a Vortex to Open to the Divine\u201d and \u201cGroup Past-Life Regression.\u201d\n\nThe opening talk, by Diane Corcoran, the association\u2019s president, was clearly for newbies; the main ballroom, which seats about 300 people, was almost empty. She began by outlining the wide variety of circumstances in which people have NDEs\u2014\u201cheart attack, near-drowning, electrocution, terminal illness, combat fatigue\u201d\u2014then moved on to the typical characteristics of the experience. She referred to Bruce Greyson, one of the first doctors to study NDEs seriously, who developed a scale that rates the intensity of an experience on 16 separate counts, such as feelings of joy, encountering spiritual beings, and a sense of being separated from one\u2019s body. The scale assigns a score of 0 to 2 for each count, allowing for a maximum possible score of 32. A 7 or higher is classified as an NDE, and according to one study, the average score among people who report such an experience is about 15. However, Corcoran emphasized, the long-term effects of an NDE are as important an indicator of whether you\u2019ve had one as the experience itself. Many people, she said, don\u2019t realize for years that they\u2019ve had an NDE, and piece it together only after they notice the effects. These include heightened sensitivity to light, sound, and certain chemicals; becoming more caring and generous, sometimes to a fault; having trouble with timekeeping and finances; feeling unconditional love for everyone, which can be taxing on relatives and friends; and having a strange influence on electrical equipment. At one conference of NDErs, Corcoran recounted, the hotel\u2019s computer system went down. \u201cYou put 400 experiencers in a hotel together, something\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d she said. The scattered audience chuckled approvingly.\n\nCorcoran herself wore two name badges. One said her name and trailed a multicolored strip of ribbons like an unrolled window blind reading 35 YEARS, LEGACY SOCIETY, ASK ME, and HERE TO SERVE. (\u201cIt started as a joke,\u201d she told me of adding ribbons at each conference, \u201cand it became a tradition.\u201d) The other badge said The Colonel: her long career includes a series of senior nursing posts in the Army Nurse Corps (she has a doctorate in nursing management). She first encountered NDEs when, as a junior nurse, she served at Long Binh, the largest army base in Vietnam, in 1969. \u201cNobody was talking about them,\u201d Corcoran said when we met over breakfast. \u201cA young man told me about [an NDE] and I had no idea what he was talking about, but I could see the emotion and intensity of it for him.\u201d Since then, she has been trying to get the medical profession to take NDEs more seriously. \u201cDeath and dying is not something most physicians deal with very well to begin with,\u201d she noted drily. \u201cSo when you start to talk about phenomena where you leave your body and see and hear things, you\u2019re way out of their ballpark.\u201d More recently, she had been trying, with difficulty, to find veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who were willing to talk about any NDEs they might have had. \u201cI was always adamant in the Army that this is a medical issue. I tell [doctors] they have to make up their own minds, but there are lots of patients who\u2019ve had this experience, and if you\u2019re going to take care of them, you have to have this information.\u201d\n\nWritten accounts of near-death experiences\u2014or things that sound like them\u2014date back at least to the Middle Ages, and some researchers say to ancient times. The medical journal Resuscitation recently published a brief account of the oldest known medical description of an NDE, written by an 18th-century French military doctor. But the modern era of research into near-death experiences is generally said to have begun in 1975. That was the year Raymond A. Moody Jr., a philosopher turned psychiatrist, published Life After Life, a book based on interviews with some 50 experiencers.\n\nMoody\u2019s book set off a steady stream of memoirs, TV shows, and articles. Since then, a small community has emerged of psychiatrists, psychologists, cardiologists, and other specialists. They share Moody\u2019s belief that consciousness\u2014the mind, the soul, call it what you will\u2014may exist in some nonmaterial form, independent of but closely connected to the brain, and that NDEs may be able to provide evidence of it. The leading members of this coterie have distinguished careers at respectable universities and hospitals. They blurb one another\u2019s books and give talks on spirituality and the nature of consciousness. Of those books, probably the single best overview is The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences: Thirty Years of Investigation, an anthology published in 2009. As The Handbook outlines, by 2005 dozens of studies involving nearly 3,500 subjects who reported having had NDEs had become material for some 600 scholarly articles. Many of these articles are in the Journal of Near-Death Studies, the IANDS house journal\u2014which, the association proudly notes, is peer-reviewed. But many others are in mainstream medical publications. A search in February on PubMed, a database that is maintained by the National Library of Medicine (and that doesn\u2019t include the IANDS journal in its index), turned up 240 papers mentioning near-death experiences. Most of the NDE studies have been retrospective, meaning the researchers looked for people who\u2019d had such an experience to come forward and be interviewed. That poses a couple of problems, scientifically speaking. It means the subjects were self-selecting, so they might not be representative. For instance, people who\u2019d had scary NDEs might have been less eager to tell their stories than people who\u2019d had uplifting ones. (One of the arguments you hear for why NDEs are not hallucinations of the dying brain is that so many of the stories contain similar features; but it\u2019s notable that, while some studies indeed report only the well-known positive experiences, unpleasant NDEs account for a combined 23 percent of reports across a dozen different studies. They get far less attention, and certainly don\u2019t seem to sell nearly as many books.) Most of the interviews took place years after the fact, so memories might have been faulty. And most important, retrospective studies make it pretty much impossible to obtain reliable data on what was actually happening to the subjects\u2019 bodies and brains while they felt their souls were elsewhere.\n\nAbout a dozen prospective studies have been published, several of them in recent years. In these, researchers typically arrange for every consenting patient who survives a specific medical emergency (such as a cardiac arrest) at a hospital to be interviewed as soon as possible thereafter. The patients are asked open-ended questions about what, if anything, they experienced while doctors were trying to revive them. If they report anything unusual, the researchers check their medical records and the accounts of people who treated them, looking for things that might explain the experience or show that their brain was shut down at the relevant time. All told, these studies have collected the near-death experiences of just under 300 people. The goal for those who believe the mind really does leave the body is to find a verified case of what one prominent researcher has termed \u201capparently nonphysical veridical perception\u201d\u2014in other words, having an experience during which you see or hear things you otherwise couldn\u2019t have perceived that are later confirmed to have actually happened. (Veridical means \u201cnot illusory.\u201d) An out-of-body experience is only one of the 16 possible elements of a near-death experience on the Greyson scale, and the proportion of experiencers who report having had one varies widely from one study to another. As the only stage in an NDE that involves perceiving the physical rather than the spiritual world, an out-of-body experience has the most potential to convince skeptics. If you could prove that someone saw or heard things that brain science says they could not have seen or heard, you would have, at the very least, evidence that our understanding of the brain is even more incomplete than we thought, and at most, a sign that a conscious mind can exist apart from a living body.\n\nAs a result, reports of veridical perception have a totemic significance among NDErs. One of the most celebrated is the story of \u201cMaria,\u201d a migrant worker who had an NDE during a cardiac arrest at a hospital in Seattle in 1977. She later told her social worker that while doctors were resuscitating her, she found herself floating outside the hospital building and saw a tennis shoe on a third-floor window ledge, which she described in some detail. The social worker went to the window Maria had indicated, and not only found the shoe but said that the way it was placed meant there was no way Maria could have seen all the details she described from inside her hospital room. That social worker, Kimberly Clark Sharp, is now a bubbly 60-something with a shock of frizzy hair who acted as my informal press officer during the conference. She and her story are an IANDS institution; I heard several people refer to \u201cthe case of Maria\u2019s shoe\u201d or just \u201cthe tennis-shoe case.\u201d But while Maria\u2019s shoe certainly makes for a compelling story, it\u2019s thin on the evidential side. A few years after being treated, Maria disappeared, and nobody was able to track her down to further confirm her story. A case with a lot more evidence is that of Pam Reynolds, a singer-songwriter. In 1991 Reynolds, then 35, underwent surgery to remove a huge aneurysm at the base of her brain. Worried that the aneurysm might burst and kill her during the operation, her surgeon opted for the radical move of \u201chypothermic cardiac arrest\u201d\u2014chilling her body to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, stopping her heart, and draining the blood from her head. The cooling would prevent her cells from dying while deprived of oxygen. When the doctors restarted her heart and warmed her body back up, she would, in effect, be rebooted. Whether you saw a divine being or your brain was merely pumping out chemicals, the experience is so intense that it forces you to rethink your place on Earth. To make absolutely sure that Reynolds\u2019s brain was completely inactive during the operation, the medical team put small speakers into her ears that played rapid, continuous clicks at 100 decibels\u2014a sound level described as equivalent to that produced by a lawn mower or a jackhammer. If any part of her mind was working, that insistent clicking would show up as electrical signals in the brain stem, which the surgeons were monitoring on an electroencephalogram.\n\nThe machine confirmed that for a number of minutes Reynolds was effectively dead in both brain and body. Yet after the surgery she reported having had a powerful NDE, including an out-of-body experience, and accurately recalled several details about what was going on in the operating room, such as the shape of the bone saw used on her skull, snatches of conversations between the medical staff, and the staff listening\u2014rather inappropriately, she remembered thinking\u2014to \u201cHotel California\u201d (\u201cYou can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\u201d). For the near-death-experience community, Reynolds is Exhibit A. But none of Reynolds\u2019s reported veridical perceptions happened while her EEG recorded a flat line. They all took place before or after, when she was under anesthetic but very much alive. \u201cAnesthesia awareness\u201d is generally estimated to affect roughly one in 1,000 patients. (See \u201cAwakening,\u201d by Joshua Lang, in the January/February 2013 Atlantic.) Therefore, the skeptical argument goes, Reynolds could have heard snatches of conversation; she might have deduced some things about the bone saw from the noise it made or the vibration of it against her skull; and she might have reconstructed some false memories out of details she\u2019d noticed before or after the operation. In 2011, a year after Reynolds died (of heart failure), the Journal of Near-Death Studies devoted an entire issue to a debate about her case, in which a skeptic and two believers argued over such minutiae as the duration of the noise played by the speakers in her ears, the way bone conducts sound, and esoteric theories of how exactly a nonphysical mind might be able to perceive physical stimuli. Summing it up, Janice Miner Holden, the journal\u2019s editor, concluded that cases like Reynolds\u2019s \u201cprovide imperfect data that probably can never result in definitive evidence.\u201d\n\nOther cases of apparent veridical perception are, at the very least, intriguing\u2014but there are surprisingly few. For a chapter she wrote in The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences, Holden scoured the literature in search of such accounts. Leaving out sources like the personal memoirs published after Raymond Moody\u2019s 1975 book and focusing mostly on books published before 1975 and systematic studies by researchers and medics, she collected about 100 reports of veridical perception during a near-death experience. Only 35 included accounts of details that the authors were able to verify as fully accurate with a source other than the experiencer. There was not a single clincher\u2014an absolutely inarguable case of someone seeing something that only a disembodied spirit could have seen. Which is why a few studies have tried to take advantage of the unique circumstances under which NDEs tend to happen, to create a foolproof method for testing veridical perception. To get the kind of evidence for a disembodied consciousness that would satisfy a scientist, you need a good study protocol. Turns out, it\u2019s not hard to devise one. In The Handbook, Janice Holden outlines it: In a place where NDEs are likely to occur, plant some perceptual stimulus and then interview everyone who survives a near-death episode in the vicinity of that stimulus to determine whether they perceived it \u2026 Place the stimulus so that it is perceivable by an NDEr but not by other people in the area; in fact, to rule out the possibility that an interviewer or others might intentionally or unintentionally convey the content of the stimulus to the NDEr through normal\u2014or even paranormal\u2014means, arrange it so that the stimulus is not known even to the research team or associates. To date, six studies have tried some form of this method, mostly on cardiac-arrest patients, and all have failed to find an ironclad case of veridical perception. All involved placing some stimulus\u2014a picture or a symbol on, say, a piece of paper or an electronic display\u2014in a high location, visible only if you were floating near the ceiling. The research designers did their best to make sure that nobody\u2014not the doctors or nurses, not the patient, and not whoever interviewed the patient afterward\u2014would know what the stimulus was until after the interviews were over. (Getting the hospital staff to respect this protocol, Holden reports, wasn\u2019t always easy.)\n\nThe latest and largest such attempt was the so-called Aware study, led by Sam Parnia of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, published in Resuscitation last October. In it, 15 participating hospitals in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Austria installed shelves bearing a variety of images in rooms where cardiac-arrest patients were likely to need reviving. The results of the Aware study immediately highlight the key problem with this kind of research: it\u2019s very hard to get enough data. Over four years, the study recorded a total of 2,060 cardiac arrests. (There were more than that, but the researchers weren\u2019t able to record them all.) Of those patients, 330 survived, 140 of whom were judged well enough to be interviewed and agreed to participate. Of those 140, 101 made it past a screening interview; the others were unable to continue, \u201cpredominantly due to fatigue.\u201d Of those 101, nine remembered experiences that counted as an NDE on the Greyson scale, and two remembered an out-of-body experience. Of those two, one became too ill to interview further. That left just one subject who could recount what he\u2019d seen in detail. That one case is tantalizing. The patient, a 57-year-old man, described floating up to a corner of the room, seeing medical staff work on him, and watching himself be defibrillated. According to Parnia\u2019s paper, several of the details he described checked out. What\u2019s more, after triangulating the patient\u2019s description with the workings of the defibrillator, the researchers think he may have seen things that happened for as long as three minutes after his heart stopped.\n\nIf true, that would be remarkable. On an EEG, the brain typically flatlines within about 20 seconds of the heart stopping. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation gets enough blood flowing to slow cell death, but not enough to fire up the brain. Unlike the brain of someone under anesthetic or in a coma, this patient\u2019s brain should have completely switched off until his heart started beating on its own again. Still, the clinching evidence remains elusive. Even though the Aware study\u2019s hospitals collectively installed about 1,000 shelves with the special images at various locations, only 22 percent of the cardiac arrests happened somewhere with a shelf nearby. The star patient\u2019s wasn\u2019t one of them. It\u2019s little wonder that, next to transcendent NDE stories, experiencers find the explanations that science has to offer unsatisfying. There is no shortage of scientific theories about what causes near-death experiences\u2014or at least, what might\u2014but they are cold, unappealing, and incomplete by comparison with what NDErs say happened to them. It\u2019s well established, for instance, that an oxygen shortage (hypoxia), which is a common result of a cardiac arrest, can lead to disorientation, confusion, or hallucinations. A glitch at the temporoparietal junction, a part of the brain that acts as a kind of integrator of data from all your senses and organs and plays an important role in assembling them into your overall perception of your body, can produce an out-of-body experience. It\u2019s been suggested\u200b \u200bthat too much carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) \u200bmay\u200b give people a feeling of separation from their body or of being in a tunnel\u200b (though there\u2019s not much evidence of this)\u200b. Neurochemicals might play a part in triggering hallucinations or creating a sense of peace. And so on.\n\nDoctors who are sympathetic to experiencers\u2019 claims have no shortage of rebuttals to these materialist explanations. Sam Parnia, Pim van Lommel, and others devote lengthy sections in their books to them. Ultimately, what the rebuttals boil down to is that while these explanations may look plausible, there\u2019s no evidence that they actually do explain what\u2019s going on. Many NDEs happen without one or another of the above scientifically measurable conditions. And those conditions often happen without an NDE. Enough data simply haven\u2019t been recorded to establish correlation, let alone causation. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s hard to see how there can be enough data, at least when the experimental method is to look at records of cardiac-arrest cases. Parnia\u2019s Aware study turned up just nine patients with NDEs at 15 hospitals in four years. A Slovenian prospective study published in 2010, which did find a correlation between NDEs and hypercarbia in heart-attack patients\u2014though no correlation with hypoxia\u2014had only 52 patients in the sample, and only 11 of them reported NDEs. There is one newish bit of research that the materialist camp has seized on. A study at the University of Michigan, published in 2013, took anesthetized rats and stopped their hearts. Within 30 seconds, the rats\u2019 EEG brain signals flatlined\u2014but first they spiked, with an intensity that suggested that different parts of the brain were communicating with one another even more actively than when the rats were awake.\n\nThis sort of communication is thought to be a key step in perception; effectively, the brain\u2019s various areas are comparing notes on the stimuli they\u2019re getting. If humans experience the same death spike as rats, it may mean that the brain goes into a final, hyperactive spasm when its oxygen supply is cut as it tries to figure out what is happening. If so, that heightened activity might explain why people who say they had an NDE report that what they experienced seemed more real than the physical world. But once again, the fact that the explanation is plausible doesn\u2019t make it true. If researchers like Parnia can convincingly show that a patient like the man in the Aware study can have flashes of conscious awareness minutes or more after the heart stops, the whole debate will flare up again. For now, the death spike remains just one more disjointed piece of the NDE puzzle, which we have not yet figured out how to assemble. So where next for the science of near-death experiences?, I asked Susan Blackmore, a British psychologist who is perhaps the best-known scientific skeptic of the spiritualist explanations for NDEs. After having her own powerful out-of-body experience as a young woman, she started investigating paranormal claims, and devoted much of her career to scientifically explaining them. As far as Blackmore is concerned, the mystery has mostly been solved. We already know, she says, that a hyperactive brain under the stress of approaching death can trigger any or all of the above phenomena. The big remaining question, she wrote in an e-mail, is this: We see all of these aspects in isolation\u2014spontaneously, with various drugs, in illness and so on\u2014but in the NDE they tend to unfold in a specific order. Why is this? We might guess that it has something to do with a cascade of neurotransmitters or possibly the way hyperactivity spreads or \u2026 ? I do not know the answer here but I guess we will soon find out. I think that a scientific answer to Blackmore\u2019s question\u2014why so many NDEs follow a similar sequence\u2014would do more than merely complete the puzzle of how they happen. It would also help us understand why NDEs have such a profound effect on those who experience them. One of the speakers at the conference, Alana Karran, an executive coach who led a guided meditation that retraced the steps of a typical NDE, helped me understand the significance of that sequence. It is, she pointed out, similar to the hero\u2019s journey, or quest narrative, the structure that the American writer and mythologist Joseph Campbell identified and named the \u201cmonomyth\u201d in 1949. The quest underlies just about every form of storytelling, from religious myth to Greek epic to Hollywood blockbuster to personal memoir. In this structure, a protagonist is shaken out of his normal way of life by some disturbance and\u2014often reluctantly at first, but at the urging of some kind of mentor or wise figure\u2014strikes out on a journey to an unfamiliar realm. There he faces tests, battles enemies, questions the loyalty of friends and allies, withstands a climactic ordeal, teeters on the brink of failure or death, and ultimately returns to where he began, victorious but in some way transformed.\n\nMany of the NDEs people relate follow some version of this structure. In Proof of Heaven, Eben Alexander describes his experience as beginning with him trapped in a dark place, a kind of semitransparent mud or \u201cdirty Jell-O,\u201d filled with \u201cgrotesque animal faces,\u201d that comes to feel progressively more claustrophobic and frightening. Eventually, something pulls him up into \u201cthe strangest, most beautiful world I\u2019d ever seen\u201d\u2014an idyllic countryside. There he encounters a beautiful girl riding on a butterfly\u2019s wing, who tells him he is \u201cloved and cherished, dearly, forever,\u201d and accompanies him on a trip to a light-filled void where he meets a divine being who unlocks for him many secrets about the universe. After spending some time going back and forth between the two realms, he descends one last time into the dark place where he began, only this time the grotesque creatures have been replaced by the faces of people praying for him. If your life has been a struggle, a near-death experience sets you in a different direction: you nearly died, so something has to change. The hero\u2019s journey is so pervasive in storytelling (indeed, some would say Campbell ruined modern entertainment by identifying it) because it is so aspirational. It offers the possibility of an escape from something that holds you back, and a transformation into something better. Nobody at the conference better personified the hope for redemption and transformation than Jeff Olsen, one of the two keynote speakers. Olsen\u2019s story, which he has told in two books and in various videos on YouTube, is gut-wrenching: His car crashed after he fell asleep at the wheel while driving his family back from vacation. Lying in the wreckage with his back broken, one arm nearly torn off, and one leg destroyed, he was for a while conscious enough to register that his 7-year-old son was crying but his wife and infant son were silent. In I Knew Their Hearts, one of his books, he writes, \u201cWhat do you say to a man who feels responsible for the death of half his family?\u201d\n\nThe answer\u2014at least if you are a spiritual being\u2014is \u201cYou are perfect; you are my son as much as anyone ever was; and you are divine.\u201d That is what Olsen recounts hearing\u2014or feeling, or having somehow transmitted to him\u2014as part of a \u201cbrain dump\u201d during his near-death experience. He seemed to find himself in a room with a crib, holding the son who had been killed. When he picked him up, he in turn felt himself being enveloped by a loving presence that he understood to be his \u201cdivine creator.\u201d This is key to what makes near-death experiences so powerful, and why people cling so strongly to them regardless of the scientific evidence. Whether you actually saw a divine being or your brain was merely pumping out chemicals like never before, the experience is so intense and new that it forces you to rethink your place on Earth. If the NDE happened during a tragedy, it provides a way to make sense of that tragedy and rebuild your life. If your life has been a struggle with illness or doubt, an NDE sets you in a different direction: you nearly died, so something has to change. And that brings us back to Susan Blackmore\u2019s question: If NDEs are only the result of your brain going haywire, why do so many of them follow a sequence that just happens to track our most basic narrative structure of transformation and renewal? There appeared to be nobody at the conference who thought that near-death experiences are just a product of physical processes in the brain. But there were several people whose talks promised to address the science of NDEs.\n\nAlan Hugenot is a middle-aged mechanical engineer who walks and talks with a kinetic intensity, as if he can barely keep himself from ricocheting off the walls. His session was called \u201cLeading-Edge Science of the Afterlife.\u201d Taking the audience through a hodgepodge of advanced physics and mysticism, he concluded that the entire universe is conscious and that this explains both near-death experiences and certain paradoxes of quantum theory. As someone with a physics degree, I know that Hugenot\u2019s theory is full of holes, but I also know that the basic idea of a conscious universe is neither crazy nor new. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, one of the fathers of quantum physics, was an avid student of Hindu philosophy, and believed something similar. There\u2019s a long tradition of leading scientists holding religious and mystical beliefs. Near-death experiences are perhaps the only spiritual moments that we have a chance of investigating in a thorough, scientific way. But what makes them scientists is that they know and maintain the distinction between scientific theories, which must be testable against observable evidence, and mysticism or speculation. So at the end of Hugenot\u2019s talk, I asked him to tell me how his theory is testable. He didn\u2019t answer the question at first, but eventually said that there are experiments that could be designed. Had he designed them?, I asked. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had the chance to do that yet.\u201d\n\nMore sedate was Robert Mays, a professorial figure with a Sigmund Freud beard who outlined a detailed theory he\u2019d developed with his wife, Suzanne. Mays proposed that a nonmaterial consciousness\u2014a \u201cmind entity\u201d\u2014could direct the physical brain, like the Wizard of Oz pulling levers behind a curtain. This, Mays said, is the explanation that resolves both the problem of how a series of electrical impulses in the brain becomes the sensation of consciousness and the mystery of near-death experiences. Mays, at least, was extremely specific about which brain cells he thinks the mind entity interacts with in order to control the brain. He even has some ideas about what the mind entity might be in physical terms: \u201ca finely differentiated structure of minute oscillating electric or magnetic dipoles,\u201d he and Suzanne have written. When I asked him how his theory might be tested, he said that one could measure the influence of a person\u2019s \u201cenergetic field\u201d on \u201cliving neurons in vitro.\u201d Which would be fine, except that his idea of the energetic field is something no physicist has ever seen. For all their differences in style and subject matter, Mays, Hugenot, and others are offering similar visions: large, all-encompassing explanations that link things people know to be true with things they would like to be true and that bring a sense of order to the universe. It makes sense that NDErs would find such stuff compelling.\n\nBut why was there so much resistance at the conference to real, solid science? At my breakfast with Diane Corcoran, I asked her why nobody at the conference seemed to be discussing the materialist position. \u201cOver the years, and with the research that\u2019s been done, we\u2019ve moved past that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a skeptic or two, but we don\u2019t bring them into this environment, because this is meant to be a supportive environment, not a questioning one.\u201d She added, \u201cWe put out a call for papers, but we\u2019ve never had a skeptic put in a paper.\u201d \u201cThey probably feel that they wouldn\u2019t be welcomed,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably true!\u201d she replied. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to expand the field, and there\u2019s a lot of work in consciousness existing outside the brain.\u201d One prominent researcher, she said, argues that \u201cwhen someone publishes a paper saying \u2018This is the explanation,\u2019 it\u2019s not even worth responding to. Most people who do that have not investigated the field in any serious way.\u201d At some level, I find this reasonable. A lot of writing about NDEs does not merely question experiencers but ridicules them. And it\u2019s true that the scientific explanations, while plausible, aren\u2019t conclusive. Nonetheless, at the conference I encountered not just resistance to but a great many misconceptions about science. In the hotel corridors, I ran into Hugenot. The whole point of scientific theories, I said, is that they have to be testable. Testable means falsifiable: you have to be able in principle to do an experiment that might show a theory to be wrong. If I were to drop the cup of coffee I was holding, for instance, and it didn\u2019t go all over the floor but instead floated off down the corridor, that would falsify the theory of gravity. Every time the theory survives such a test, our confidence in it increases. But our belief in the theory always remains provisional: we\u2019re constantly on the lookout for situations in which it might not hold true. So how, I asked, is a conscious universe testable?", "description": "Empirically investigating brushes with the afterlife", "authors": ["Gideon Lichfield"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2015/03/Lichfield_opener/facebook.jpg?1522840924", "published_at": "2015-03-16"}
