Have you ever wondered though what the benefits of stuffed toys are?\n\nWhen buying a toy for your child do you buy it with a certain intention? Or because it's a cute toy that'll make your baby happy?\n\nHave you ever wondered why your little one is so calm when they play with their favourite stuffed toys?\n\nWe reached out to experts who answered these questions for us.\n\n\n\nNot just a toy\n\nJoburg based psychologist, Tsholofelo Jood, says that stuffed toys are not just a cute toy: they are way more than that.\n\n\u201cStuffed toys are psychologically important and were termed transitional objects by Dr. Donald Winnicott in 1953,\" Tsholofelo told Parent24. \"The term transitional object captures how these toys give the child the opportunity to not solely depend on the adult caregiver for comfort and soothing.\"\n\nShe explained how the toy allows the child to explore receiving support, outside the bounds of their relationship with the primary caregiver. A child\u2019s sense of security and safety is imbued in this toy, and it becomes more than a mere toy.\n\n\n\nProvides comfort in unfamiliar environments\n\nTsholofelo says young children learn to depend on the stuffed toy when they find themselves in distress, or during times of discomfort.\n\n\u201cA chosen stuffed toy fosters a sense of familiarity in unfamiliar environments. This settles a young child and makes the distress of an unfamiliar environment more bearable.\u201d\n\nFairuz Gaibie, a clinical psychologist from Cape Town, agrees that children often associate stuffed toys with positive occurrences.\n\n\u201cFor children a teddy bear tends to have additional positive associations, usually of the safety of home or caregivers. Therefore, children often feel better going to preschool or sleeping over somewhere unfamiliar if their teddies come along.\u201d\n\n\n\nReleases Oxytocin\n\nFairuz also says when we cuddle anything soft and comforting, like a teddy bear, it releases oxytocin.\n\nThis is a hormone that leaves us feeling calm and soothed.\n\nWe hardwired to be more drawn toward soft and cuddly things, and this applies to both kids and adults.\n\nAlso read: Pregnancy hormones and what they do\n\n\n\nSentimental Value\n\n\n\nFor adults, many still have stuffed toys from their childhood days, but may feel embarrassed about this when there is absolutely no need to be.\n\nAnything can hold symbolic and sentimental meaning to us - whether it is rock or a necklace.\n\nIt is often not so much the actual object that is special to us, but what it represents and symbolises, and the memories it conjures.\n\nTsholofelo reiterates this point, saying \u201cthese stuffed toys hold a lot of sentimental value for young children, because of the emotional support they provide.\u201d\n\n\n\nNurturing\n\nCuddling soft toys encourages children to be nurturing, which would also be the case if they cuddled with baby dolls.\n\nThe instinct to be gentle and caring is innate in children who are cared for gently and when they cuddle their teddies, it is often an enacting of this instinct.\n\nMany kids will make beds for their soft toys, \"feed\" them and host pretend tea parties for them.\n\n\n\nLastly, when a child is disregulated (tired, afraid or overstimulated), the softness of a teddy can serve as an effective soothing aid.\n\n\u201cStuffed toys are soft and cuddly for a reason; they are useful for kids to negotiate difficult developmental challenges. Parents are encouraged to collaborate with their children when choosing these meaningful toys,\u201d advises Tsholofelo.\n\n\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
