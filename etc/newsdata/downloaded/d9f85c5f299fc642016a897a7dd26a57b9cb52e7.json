REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nThe deal, marking the biggest shift in commercial aerospace in decades, would reshape a global passenger jet duopoly and reinforce Western planemakers against newcomers from China, Russia and Japan.\n\nIt would give Boeing a foothold in the lower end of the market, enabling it to better compete with the CSeries jets designed by Canada\u2019s Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA).\n\nThe deal values the Embraer unit at $4.75 billion.\n\nThe European Commission, which has set an Oct. 4 deadline for its preliminary review of the deal, did not respond to a request for immediate comment.\n\nThe EU competition enforcer will launch a full-scale investigation following the end of its review, which could take up to five months and raises pressure on Boeing to offer concessions to address competition concerns.\n\nThe Commission recently quizzed suppliers and rivals on the deal, indicating concerns about the concentration in the market.\n\nThey were asked about the impact of the reduced number of players, from seven to six and from three to two in various segments, a person with direct knowledge of the deal said.\n\nNo immediate comment was available from Boeing or Embraer.\n\nAviation analysts say there is limited overlap in the number of seats between Boeing\u2019s 737 family and Embraer\u2019s smaller E2 jets.\n\nThere is slightly more overlap between Airbus\u2019s portfolio and Bombardier\u2019s CSeries program which the European planemaker bought last year, they add.", "description": "Boeing is set to face a EU antitrust investigation of up to five months into its bid for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Brazil's Embraer , people familiar with the matter said on Monday.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432918643&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0P5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
