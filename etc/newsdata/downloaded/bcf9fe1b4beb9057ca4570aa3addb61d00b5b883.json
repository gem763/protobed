Still, it\u2019s a good place to start, and because both the 2020 BMW Z4 M40i and Porsche\u2019s ever-improving 2020 Boxster are droptops, at least we don\u2019t have to get into a philosophical discussion as to whether sports cars have to be roadsters, or can hardtop two-seaters also be included.\n\nYet, we do have our work cut out. Comparing the two German rivals fundamentally comes down to whether one prefers horsepower to handling, the BMW holding a distinct advantage under the hood, and the Porsche countering with significantly lighter weight. Then there\u2019s the discussion \u2014 or argument, depending on how passionate you feel about the subject \u2014 regarding the classic front engine, rear-drive layout and long hood, short deck styling of the Z4, versus the Boxster\u2019s more organic shaped, mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive setup. Thoughts?\n\nClayton Seams: While both of these cars meet the Wikipedia definition of a sports car, they go about it in very different ways. Let\u2019s start with the newcomer: The BMW Z4 is here in six-cylinder M40i form, and it\u2019s all the Internet has been talking about for the past few months. Its turbocharged inline-six makes 382 horsepower and 369 lb.-ft. of torque. It\u2019ll do zero to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds, and the base price of the M40i is a relatively sane $76,100.\n\nThen we have the Porsche 718 Boxster. It\u2019s true, the 350-horsepower Boxster S would be a more even match for the Z4, but the S starts at $81,000 \u2014 well above the Z4 \u2014 whereas the base 718 starts at $66,100. So, at least in base form, the 718 is less expensive and its 2.0L turbocharged flat-four less potent, at 300 horsepower and 280 lb.-ft. of torque. The 718 has been with us for several years now \u2014 even longer, if you count the mostly similar six-cylinder models. But enough of the tech talk. What are these two like on the road?\n\nBH: Brilliant in the case of the Boxster, very good for the Z4, the key difference not so much about where the engine is placed \u2014 both have 50/50 front/rear weight distribution \u2014 as weight. The Boxster is a tight and light 1,365 kilograms, the M40i a much heftier 1,643; even with the adaptive M Sport suspension, this makes the Z4 more of a cruiser, a role it plays with panache. Show it a challenging, twisting bit of tarmac and you feel the car\u2019s weight in the transitions. Additionally, its variable power-assist steering feels artificially heavy at speed, notably in the Sport modes (there are three) and a bit slow to respond. That said, the M40i goes where it\u2019s pointed and will take off like a bottle rocket when the pedal is mashed.\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\n2020 Porsche 718 Boxster Brian Harper , Driving\n\nMeanwhile, the 718\u2019s suspension was extensively retuned over the previous-generation model for enhanced cornering performance, including an electric power-steering system adopted from the 911 Turbo. It might not be quite as fast \u2014 4.9 seconds from rest to 100 km/h \u2014 but it carries that speed going into the turns and comes out faster, the grip positively limpet-like. And I have to point out that Porsche Active Suspension Management was one of the very options not on the tester (the car was kitted out with more than $25,000 worth of add-ons that raised the as-tested price to $91,110). So equipped with the PASM, ride height would have been dropped 10 millimetres. So, what\u2019s your preference?\n\nCS: The cars have very different personalities. The BMW is almost like a muscle car in how it excels in straight-line acceleration and comfortable highway cruising. The Porsche is closer to a true sports car and sacrifices some comfort for handling. I like to think of it this way: The BMW is the better car if one of these two has to be your only car. It\u2019s the better all-rounder, capable of comfy long-distance road trips, faultless city driving, and still able to dance on a backroad when summoned.\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for a weekend car and you already have a \u201cregular car,\u201d the Porsche is the one I\u2019d choose. It\u2019s an all-out sports car with all the joy and inconveniences that come with that. It actually has a similar amount of total storage space as the Z4 thanks to its dual trunks, but it\u2019s louder, stiffer, and smaller inside. Many have bemoaned the replacement of the traditional flat-six with the new turbo-four, but I like the mechanical thrum of the engine \u2014 it still sounds like a Porsche. Which one would you grab the keys to, Brian?\n\n2020 BMW Z4 Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 vs. 2020 Porsche Boxster Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 vs. 2020 Porsche Boxster Clayton Seams , Driving\n\n2020 BMW Z4 vs. 2020 Porsche Boxster Clayton Seams , Driving\n\nBH: Oh, I could easily find room in my driveway for both. The way I look at it, though, is that the Z4 is the \u201cwe\u201d car. Put it in Comfort mode and my wife and I could go for a long cruise on a nice road, enjoying the sights, sounds and smells that come with alfresco motoring. The Boxster, on the other hand, is the \u201cme\u201d car \u2014 seek out challenging roads and have at it. Five minutes with me getting \u201centhusiastic\u201d and there would be a sideways stink-eye from the missus, complete with a not-so-veiled warning that she would upchuck in my lap if I didn\u2019t slow down.\n\nStill, the Boxster better meets that Wikipedia definition of sports car. Porsche has a long, outstanding tradition of building cars that delight and reward, and other than lacking the glorious sound of a ripping flat-six \u2014 which, if you\u2019re willing to pay the tab, can be had in the new Spyder model \u2014 it checks the right boxes.
