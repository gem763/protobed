FMM - F24 Video Clips\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Critics condemned President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria as an abandonment of U.S. commitments that could further destabilize a volatile region.\n\nTrump defended the move on Twitter, saying it was time to \"get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\" Echoing his \"America first\" philosophy, Trump said that \"WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN\" and that \"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\"\n\nEven some of Trump's staunchest defenders decried the move, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who called it \"irresponsible\" and a \"stain on America's honor.\"\n\n'A reckless gamble': Four reasons critics decry Trump's 'impulsive' Syria withdrawal\n\nAbandoning an ally\n\nAs U.S. troops move aside, Turkey plans a military incursion into Syra against those it considers terrorist threats, including Kurdish fighters who joined America in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces \u2013 which dismantled its fortifications in the border region as part of an agreement meant to assuage Turkey's security concerns \u2013 blasted the U.S. move, saying the SDF had honored its commitments but its American allies \"did not fulfill their obligations.\"\n\nThe SDF said it lost 11,000 fighters in the war against the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nGraham said Trump's decision \"will be a stain on America's honor for abandoning the Kurds,\" and \"we have sent the most dangerous signal possible \u2013 America is an unreliable ally.\"\n\n\"The U.S. convinced the Kurds to destroy ISIS for us, causing massive Kurd casualties. Then we conned the Kurds into dismantling their defenses, promising to protect them. Now Trump invites the Turks into Syria, green lighting them to wipe out the Kurds,\" tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"Positively sinister.\"\n\nMore: On Syria, Donald Trump cites 'my great and unmatched wisdom' \u2013 others say no way\n\nThe U.S. convinced the Kurds to destroy ISIS for us, causing massive Kurd casualties.\n\n\n\nThen we conned the Kurds into dismantling their defenses, promising to protect them.\n\n\n\nNow Trump invites the Turks into Syria, green lighting them to wipe out the Kurds.\n\n\n\nPositively sinister. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 7, 2019\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp \u2014 Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) October 7, 2019\n\nWe degraded ISIS using Kurd\u2019s as the ground force. Now we have abandoned them & they face annihilation at the hands of the Turkish military\n\n\n\nISIS could now be reinvigorated when 1000\u2019s of jailed fighters break out when the Kurdish guards are forced to leave to go fight Turkey https://t.co/Uc6MvsNOZ5 \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nReviving the Islamic State\n\nIn March, the SDF triumphantly declared that the Islamic State suffered \"100 percent territorial defeat.\" But Gen. Mazloum Kobani, the commander of SDF forces, warned that the terrorist group still posed \"a great threat to our region and the world.\"\n\nThe SDF said Islamic State sleeper cells plot to free about 12,000 militants detained by the Kurdish fighters in the region and plan moves against the al-Hol refugee camp where about 70,000 people are held, including family members.\n\nBrett McGurk \u2013 who served as Trump's envoy to a global coalition fighting the Islamic State before resigning in 2018 over a disagreement on pulling U.S. forces from Syria \u2013 said Turkey \"has neither the intent, desire, nor capacity to manage\" the massive al-Hol camp, which the inspectors general for the State Department and the Pentagon \"warn is the nucleus for a resurgent ISIS.\"\n\n\"Believing otherwise is a reckless gamble with our national security,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel very bad for the Americans and allies who have sacrificed to destroy the ISIS Caliphate because this decision virtually reassures the reemergence of ISIS. So sad,\" Graham tweeted. \"President Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam. They are NOT tired of fighting us.\"\n\nMore: Brett McGurk, US envoy to anti-ISIS coalition, quits over Trump\u2019s Syria move\n\nEmboldening Iran\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the pullout will \"confirm Iran's view of this administration\" and embolden the regime to \"escalate hostile attacks which in turn could trigger much broader & more dangerous regional war.\"\n\nIn an article for Foreign Affairs magazine, McGurk predicted that a U.S. withdrawal in Syria could allow Iran to establish a \"fortified military presence\" there. He warned that \"if entrenched, it would constitute a major threat to Israel and Jordan, two vital U.S. allies.\"\n\nHe said Tehran's \"expansionist ambitions in Syria\" were \"deterred only by the presence of U.S. troops.\"\n\n\"The biggest winner of all of this will be the Iranians,\" Graham said Monday on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nHe said Iran's influence in Syria \"will eventually become a nightmare for Israel.\"\n\nThe most probable outcome of this impulsive decision is to ensure Iran\u2019s domination of Syria.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. now has no leverage and Syria will eventually become a nightmare for Israel. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\n'Impulsive' decision-making\n\nThough Trump's allies have touted his unpredictability as an asset because he keeps America's enemies off-balance, his decision to pull back from Syria was criticized as a major foreign policy decision made without careful deliberation.\n\n\"Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief,\" McGurk tweeted. \"He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\"\n\nGraham also called the decision \"impulsive,\" as well as \"short-sighted.\"\n\n\"Yes, Trump doublecrossed the Kurds, but really a total lack of foreign policy imagination created this crisis,\" Murphy tweeted. He said \"Trump wasted the last 30 months\" when he could have made a major diplomatic push to strike a deal that Turkey and the Kurds could accept.\n\nThe concerns about Trump's decision-making process on foreign policy come amid an impeachment inquiry centered on his alleged use of military aid as leverage to pressure a foreign government to investigate a political rival in the 2020 election.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgarrd, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/07/trumps-syria-withdrawal-impacts/3896713002/", "description": "Romney called it a \"betrayal\" that makes the U.S. look like \"an unreliable ally,\" speeds an ISIS resurgence and creates a \"humanitarian disaster.\"", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Published P.M.
