This winter, he\u2019s planning to hold two solo concerts at the 600-seat M Theater in the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in central Seoul on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.What\u2019s most remarkable about the rising star\u2019s journey to fame is that he got to where he is without the help of any big-name label or entertainment agency.Jukjae knew that he was going to pursue music as his career by the end of middle school.\u201cI almost only did music,\u201d he recalled during an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo, an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily. \u201cIt was more fun than going to the PC bang [internet gaming cafe] for me.\u201dJukjae dropped out of school during his first year of high school, and opted to take the qualification exam to go straight to college instead. He got his first gig as a professional musician soon after graduating from the Seoul Institute of the Arts with a degree in Applied Music in 2008.Coincidently, the first venue he was ever paid to perform in was also Sejong\u2019s M Theater.\u201cI was invited to play the guitar at Jung Jae-hyung\u2019s concert,\u201d Jukjae recalled.Jukjae\u2019s career picked up from there, and he\u2019s since worked as a guitarist with some of the hottest artists today, including Kim Dong-ryul, Park Hyo-shin, IU, Sam Kim, Jeong Eun-ji and Taeyeon.More recently, he\u2019s worked on arrangements and played the guitar on AKMU\u2019s latest album \u201cSailing\u201d and singer Kwon Jin-ah\u2019s \u201cShape of Me.\u201d\u201cMy skills have improved as I have continued working. I\u2019ve been inspired by other artists and picked up new styles while collaborating with different people.\u201dThe following are edited excerpts from Jukjae\u2019s interview.. When I was in my second year of middle school, I saw our school band perform and thought \u201cthis is it\u201d and signed up to join. That\u2019s when I held a guitar for the first time. I didn\u2019t have much interest in studying, but when I was practicing the guitar I didn\u2019t realize how fast the hours were passing.My guitar skills improved really quickly and I got along with my bandmates. I felt really happy when we harmonized well. Six of us in the school band formed a separate group and performed in festivals at other schools and entered competitions. At the time I mainly focused on rock.If I wanted to graduate from university, I needed to know how to compose. That\u2019s when I began learning songwriting. I\u2019ve actually had a thirst for singing ever since I started music. I wanted to sing myself but I didn\u2019t get the chance to because there were other friends who were better than me.In 2013, when I was performing in concerts as a session musician, I suddenly thought to myself that I would never be able to release an album if I didn\u2019t do it now. I liked how I could deliver my story and emotions in the lyrics while singing. When I\u2019m performing, I like to play songs that involve a lot of difficult and complicated tempos. My introverted personality comes out in the songs I write. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve written a lot of sentimental pieces.I\u2019m not a complete vocalist. I know the melodies and the lyrics I can sing and express best.Nothing. When I was in middle school it was trendy to put the \u201ck\u201d sound in our names. So some of my friends started calling me \u201cJukjae\u201d instead of my real name, Jung Jae-won, and I began feeling a closer bond with them. When I was performing gigs as a session musician I used my real name, but there were many people with the same name as me, so I\u2019ve been going as Jukjae since the early 2010s.American guitarist and singer-songwriter John Mayer. I can feel that he thinks a lot about his music.I\u2019m a really big fan and I even bought the same amp and guitar that he uses.The past year brought a lot of changes in my life. I feel like all the things I\u2019ve been doing finally rose to the surface, and I now have a lot of fans who listen to my songs. But I still want to show my transformation and growth through music. I\u2019m planning to release a new album soon and perform songs from it during the concert. I want to give my audience the feeling that they\u2019re having a special day.BY LEE JI-YOUNG [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/11201409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
