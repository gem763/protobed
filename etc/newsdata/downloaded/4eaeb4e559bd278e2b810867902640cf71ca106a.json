He was 69.\n\nWilson's ex-wife Valerie Plame confirmed in a text message that Wilson died Friday in Santa Fe. She called him a \"patriot\" with \"the heart of a lion.\"\n\nDemocratic congressman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico issued a statement acknowledging Wilson's passing. \"It was with profound sadness that I heard of the passing of Ambassador Wilson, a friend and fellow New Mexican for whom I had deep respect,\" the U.S. House Assistant Speaker said.\n\n\"Ambassador Wilson was a devoted patriot who put country and duty before politics and who had the courage to speak the truth in the face of extreme criticism. With his passing, our country lost a faithful public servant.\"\n\nIn this March 26, 2007 file photo, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson addresses the audience during a lecture at the University of Iowa Memorial Union.

Bush twisted prewar intelligence on Iraq to justify war.\n\nSubsequently, Plame's identity as a CIA operative was leaked in a scandal that led to the conviction of vice presidential aide Scooter B. Libby for lying to investigators and justice obstruction. President Trump pardoned Libby in 2018.", "description": "Wilson alleged\u200b that the administration of President George W.
