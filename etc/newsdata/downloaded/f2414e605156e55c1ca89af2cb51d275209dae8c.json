Please keep our family in your prayers,\" she wrote. \"I want so badly for him to hold me now and to feel his face on mine.\"\n\nThe couple had three children, the oldest just 6.

She has already said, 'If daddy didn't do the race, he would still be here, right?' I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'I wish daddy didn't do that race,' and I said, 'Me too.'\"\n\nNORWEGIAN RUNNER STRUCK, KILLED BY LIGHTNING DURING ULTRAMARATHON IN ITALY, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nThe National Weather Service Wichita had warned that the region was under the threat for another round of showers and storms on Saturday, with some likely to be strong or severe.

It all depends on where the charges accumulate,\" according to the agency. \"Lightning can strike the ground in an open field even if the tree line is close by.\n\nLightning known as a \"bolt from the blue\" can also strike from as far away as 25 miles away from a thunderstorm cloud, even when there appear to be clear skies, according to the NSSL.\n\n\"They can be especially dangerous because they appear to come from clear blue sky,\" the agency states.", "description": "A distance runner and father of three has been identified as the victim of a fatal lightning strike in Kansas on Saturday that happened shortly before he was about to cross the finish line for a 50-kilometer race.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
