Steven Novak said in the arrest affidavit that Vickery told him he was inside his girlfriend\u2019s home \u201cand they were getting intimate when they heard a scratching on the window and possibly somebody pulling on it.\u201d\n\nVickery reportedly ran outside naked and confronted Akar, who was allegedly peeping into his girlfriend\u2019s bedroom window and had exposed himself.
