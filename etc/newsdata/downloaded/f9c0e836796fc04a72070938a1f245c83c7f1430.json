On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t seem to know what to say or do when confronted with good questions from media professionals.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Pompeo appeared hopelessly lost when WSMV\u2019s Nancy Amon was far better prepared for an interview than he was. Soon after, the cabinet secretary\u2019s interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos was every bit as cringe-worthy. Reflecting on Pompeo\u2019s on-air comments, MSNBC\u2019s Nicole Wallace told viewers, \u201cThat was the worst appearance by an executive branch official I\u2019ve ever seen in my career.\u201d\n\nAlas, practice isn\u2019t making perfect. Yesterday, Pompeo made his third trip of the year to Kansas \u2013 where he doesn\u2019t want to be seen as a possible Republican U.S. Senate candidate \u2013 and sat down with KMUV in Wichita.\n\nQUESTION: So the President\u2019s press secretary has described some current and former members of your department, the State Department, as \u201cunelected radical bureaucrats.\u201d I know Vice President Mike Pence in an interview recently said an awful lot of the swamp has been caught up in the State Department bureaucracy. Do you agree with these descriptions of the State Department and employees in the department? POMPEO: I\u2019ve said repeatedly this a talented, diverse workforce capably delivering on America\u2019s mission set. I hope we get a chance, Stephen, sometime to talk a little bit about what I came on today. You seem fixated on this storyline about this inquiry. You seem incredibly fixated on that. I came here to Kansas today to talk about things that really matter, the things that when I walk around and I talk to people they care deeply about here in Kansas.\n\nNote, this was the secretary of State\u2019s opportunity to defend his own cabinet agency against ugly and misguided attacks, but after a brief, perfunctory comment, Pompeo \u2013 the nation\u2019s chief diplomat, whose sole professional focus is on American foreign policy \u2013 said he only wanted to talk about the issues he hears while walking around Kansas.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the Republican is thinking more about his next job than his current one.\n\nAlso yesterday, Pompeo sat down with the Wichita Eagle, and that interview turned messy, too.\n\nEAGLE: And what good really is the word of the U.S. in light of the president\u2019s treatment of the Kurds? Has that undercut U.S. credibility? POMPEO: The whole predicate of your question is insane. The word the United States\u2013 I\u2019ll give you a good example \u2013 the word of the United States is much more respected today than it was just two and a half years ago.\n\nI realize that Mike Pompeo, a brazen partisan, is always on the lookout for opportunities to take cheap shots at Barack Obama, but the rest of the world seems to do disagree with his answer to a question that was anything but \u201cinsane.\u201d The United States really did abandon our Kurdish allies, whom Donald Trump has chastised as \u201cno angels.\u201d The affect on American credibility abroad is real, whether Pompeo wants to acknowledge this or not.\n\nIf the secretary of State can\u2019t answer some of these basic questions responsibly, why does he keep agreeing to interviews?", "description": "If the secretary of State can't answer some of these basic questions responsibly, why does he keep agreeing to interviews?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_wh_deadline_pompeo_191018_1571691246431.jpg?itok=iSv3AwdU", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
