His reward \u2014 several days in jail on attempted murder charges.\n\nOmar Sandoval, a small store owner in Tlatelolco, Mexico, survived a robbery attempt this week when three suspects carrying knives and handguns held him up after he closed his business, Mexico\u2019s Excelsior reported. Rather than give in to the robbers\u2019 demands, Sandoval fought off the attackers using hand-to-hand techniques, disarmed one of the gunmen, and shot at them several times. The robbers survived the exchange of gunfire.\n\nHowever, as Mexican law enforcement officials arrived, they not only arrested the three robbers. Police also arrested Sandoval \u2014 initially charging him with attempted murder. Residents from Tatlelolco rallied around Sandoval as they expressed outrage at the Mexican authorities. Sandoval spent several days in jail as his attorneys worked to get the charges dismissed.\n\nNuestro vecino Omar en el momento de recuperar su libertad anoche.

The case points to an ongoing trend in Mexico\u2019s current judicial system where criminals are rarely prosecuted while average citizens are often trampled by the wheels of justice.\n\nAccording to the Index on Global Impunity measured by America\u2019s University in Puebla, Mexico ranks fourth in the list of countries with the most impunity. The study revealed the lack of professionalism in the country\u2019s investigative agencies leading to only 17 percent of actual homicide suspects being prosecuted and jailed. In addition, the group also pointed to 93.7 percent of crimes taking place in Mexico not being reported by victims, demonstrating a clear distrust of the law enforcement system in Mexico.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
