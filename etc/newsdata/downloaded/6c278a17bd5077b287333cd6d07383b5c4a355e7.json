But enough time has passed that perceptions of that dark day seem to be shifting, particularly among the young. I was just reflecting this morning on the fact that next year will be the first presidential election where some of the voters entering their polling places weren\u2019t even born when Muslim extremists from al Qaeda took the lives of more than 3,000 Americans and brought the economic capital of the world to its knees. For those people, 9/11 is something you read about in the history books or watch in grainy documentary footage.\n\nIn years past, MSNBC used to replay their live coverage from the day of the attacks in sync with the timing of events as they played out. They didn\u2019t do that last year and I don\u2019t see it scheduled on their lineup today, but perhaps they will. Or at least somebody should. It\u2019s not that we want to relive that horror show, but we need to. And those who were too young to remember, or not even born yet, should live through it again. It\u2019s important because America and all the free people of the world have an enemy. And that enemy is still out there, plotting and waiting for another chance. We may have crushed many of them on several battlefields, but they still remain. Some of them are right here in our own country.\n\nIn terms of teaching our young people, HBO is releasing three documentary specials this evening. The primary one, being released first, was designed specifically to \u201chelp children understand 9/11.\u201d The projects were produced by filmmaker Amy Schatz. I hope they turn out to be worthwhile, but the interview she gave to the AP gives me pause.\n\nOne of the biggest questions many children obviously have is why. Why would Osama bin Laden do something like that? Schatz\u2019s answer doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest questions the kids have is \u2019why? \u2018Why would somebody do that? Why would there be such cruelty?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very difficult thing to grapple with and answer so that was the trickiest part of the project.\u201d The film tells of Osama bin Laden and his activism that started with the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan. But it never truly answers the whys. Maybe no one can.\n\nExcuse me, but did you say \u201cOsama bin Laden\u2019s activism?\u201d So Schatz\u2019s films don\u2019t answer the question of why and she suggests that \u201cmaybe no one can.\u201d Sorry to point this out, but we know why. We\u2019ve known why since before it happened. Some people apparently don\u2019t like to say the words Radical Muslim Extremism. But when you\u2019ve suffered those kinds of losses you\u2019ve earned the right to name the villains.\n\nSpeaking of not naming villains, the New York Times knows who brought down the towers. Airplanes. Sadly, the Times later deleted that tweet after the ridicule began pouring in but they literally tweeted that \u201cairplanes took aim at the towers.\u201d\n\nFor a different perspective, I will suggest you read a letter titled, \u201cHappy birthday to the war without end.\u201d It was written by Lauren Kay Johnson, a former Air Force officer who was 17 when the attacks took place and almost immediately signed up to serve.\n\nShe was only one of many who marched off to war to answer those attacks. Some didn\u2019t come home alive. Others did but were forever changed by the experience. And we\u2019re still fighting today. Last night Taylor wrote an essay about how the war may never end. He\u2019s right, but perhaps not in the way he intended. Sooner or later we will bring the rest of our troops home from Afghanistan.\n\nBut the real war won\u2019t be over. The enemy is still around, in nearly every country in the world. They\u2019re lurking in the darkness and hiding right in plain sight here in our own country. And that\u2019s the war that will probably never end.", "description": "Never forget?
