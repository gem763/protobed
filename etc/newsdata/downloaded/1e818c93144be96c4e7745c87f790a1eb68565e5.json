The Democrats refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election and are on a never-ending fishing expedition to tear down President Trump,\u201d the organizers advise in their outreach, which calls on Republicans to knock on doors, make phone calls and register voters.\n\n\u201cWe need your help in standing up to these members of Congress across the nation to stop the madness. Tell them to end the impeachment inquiry and get back to work for the American people,\u201d the outreach said.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 constant personal attacks, vicious lies, and now these baseless impeachment attacks, have never had anything to do with President Trump.\n\nTheir goal has always been to silence you. They want to steal you voice and you vote. The president needs you on his side in this fight. Our country is at stake.\u201d\n\nYou can find their pitch online at StoptheMadness.gop\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
