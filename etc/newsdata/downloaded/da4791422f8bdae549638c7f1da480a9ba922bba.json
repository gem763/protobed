(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nFor President Trump, the impeachment case being built by Democrats over his alleged effort to recruit foreign help for his reelection effort isn\u2019t just a \u201cWITCH HUNT,\u201d though he calls it that, too; it\u2019s \u201ctreason.\u201d It isn\u2019t just \u201cpresidential harassment,\u201d though he also makes that charge; it\u2019s an invitation to \u201cCivil War.\u201d\n\nThe president is bringing the rhetorical heavy artillery to the most serious challenge to his presidency in nearly three tumultuous, norm-busting, warp-speed years in office.\n\nExpanding on the lexicon of outrage and victimhood honed during the probe into Russian interference in the last election, Trump is invoking the muskets-and-ramparts idioms of the country\u2019s beginnings.\n\nThe ratcheting up of his rhetoric is also indicative of Trump\u2019s tendency to interpret any criticism of him as an attack on the government, worrying critics and scholars who warn of the dangers posed by his l\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi call to arms.\n\n\u201cCharging anyone with treason is a most unusual act in American history. It\u2019s an incendiary charge which relates to the ultimate crime: overthrow of the state,\u201d said Michael J. Glennon, an international law professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nIn setting out a definition and consequences for treason in the Constitution, including death, the Founders were guarding against the \u201cdanger that the charge of treason could be made irresponsibly against political opponents,\u201d he said, adding that cavalierly throwing around words like treason and civil war belies their unique meaning in American history.\n\n\u201cI suppose it has an incendiary effect on some supporters, but we are dealing with dynamite here,\u201d Glennon said.\n\nTrump has focused his most pointed comments on Rep. Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who is one of the president\u2019s chief antagonists, and the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint concerning Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of impeachment push over accusations that Trump misused the power of his office.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam B. Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday.\n\n\u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d the president wrote.\n\nHe followed up Tuesday with more complaints about Schiff.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Congressman Adam B. Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement, which was very dishonest and bad for me, was directly made by the President of the United States? This should never be allowed!\u201d Trump bellowed on Twitter.\n\nBrought up on charges of what, exactly? And by whose order? American presidents cannot order someone arrested, and Trump didn\u2019t say whether he is enlisting Attorney General William P. Barr on this one.\n\nLast week Trump called the whistleblower \u201calmost a spy.\u201d He added: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nIn his effort to attack the whistleblower and Democrats\u2019 impeachment push, Trump has grasped at the tools he knows: communication and storytelling, said Meena Bose, executive dean at Hofstra University\u2019s Peter S. Kalikow School of Government, Public Policy and International Affairs.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump understands public communications, and this is an effort to gain the upper hand publicly, to control the narrative,\u201d Bose said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t think he is serious about trying to have Schiff arrested, but \u201che\u2019s speaking to his most loyal supporters\u201d when he suggests that his \u2014 and their \u2014 political enemies should be strung up, Bose said.\n\nTrump was complaining Tuesday about Schiff\u2019s dramatic license as he summarized the president\u2019s telephone conversation during a hearing on the whistleblower complaint.\n\nTrump\u2019s end of the call reads like a \u201cclassic organized-crime shakedown,\u201d Schiff said at that televised session Thursday. He went on to say Trump was leveraging American aid and support for Ukraine\u2019s vulnerable democracy and then put words in the president\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cI hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though,\u201d Schiff said, summarizing Trump\u2019s conversation rather than reading directly from the rough transcript of the call. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it.\u201d\n\nThe actual wording wasn\u2019t quite as blunt, but Trump\u2019s meaning was unmistakable. According to the transcript, he tells Zelensky he wants the new leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the origins of the Russia investigation. He suggests Zelensky work with Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\n\u201cThe congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle\u2019 Adam B. Schiff\u2019s fraudulently made up version of the call,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday. \u201cThis is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!\u201d\n\nIn that, Trump gives a synopsis of his defense: There was nothing wrong with what he said on the call, Schiff is deceitful, and a subject of mockery, and the entire affair is a concoction dreamed up by Trump\u2019s perceived enemies to bring him down.\n\nIn case there were any doubt that Trump is also accusing Democrats and the news media of conspiring against his voters, the president also tweeted on Tuesday a political map of the United States, showing its vast red expanses and geographically smaller blue enclaves.\n\n\u201cTry to impeach this,\u201d the graphic said.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump had tweeted a paraphrase from Baptist preacher and television host Robert J. Jeffress Jr. on Fox News. Jeffress, Trump wrote, had said that a successful impeachment \u201cwill cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\nTrump has questioned the motives and patriotism of the whistleblower and suggested that government employees who provided information to him or her should be investigated or worse. He said he wants to learn the identity of his \u201caccuser,\u201d while members of his administration echo his charge that the whistleblower unfairly retains anonymity while passing along \u201csecondhand\u201d information.\n\nNed Price, a former CIA analyst and national security spokesman in the Obama White House, said he doubts Trump thinks he really has the power to order up summary arrests.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to do, more than anything, is personalize this. He wants a target,\u201d Price said.\n\nThe anonymity of the whistleblower works for Trump\u2019s purposes, Price and others said. Faceless, at least for now, and perhaps a dweller of the intestinal \u201cdeep state\u201d Trump loathes, the whistleblower can be demonized as the enemy within.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to turn what is a question of our democracy, our national security, the sanctity of our elections, into an issue about a single person,\u201d Price said. \u201cAnd to the extent that he can personify this and remove the broader principles at play, that\u2019s how Trump is going to wage this battle. He\u2019s not going to fight on the same turf. He\u2019s going to create his own turf.\u201d", "description": "Expanding on the lexicon of outrage and victimhood honed during the probe into Russian interference in the last election, President Trump is invoking the muskets-and-ramparts idioms of the country\u2019s beginnings.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VmVHhXfOfQV-4F0L58MJHcwuhpM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/353AAMXDW4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
