REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo\n\nThe strong numbers came against a backdrop of slowing global industrial demand and weakening manufacturing surveys from Europe and United States.\n\nStrong demand from the semiconductor industry and for items such as large gas compressors has helped the firm, which also manufactures vacuum pumps and industrial tools, to weather that environment, it said.\n\n\u201cOrder intake remained on a high level despite continuous uncertainties in the global economy,\u201d Atlas Copco chief executive Mats Rahmstrom said in a statement.\n\nHowever, the company said it expected near-term demand, by which it typically means in the current quarter, to be somewhat lower than in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cWe have seen lower activity levels in some parts of the market,\u201d Rahmstrom said, pointing to automotive and the manufacturing industry.\n\nAtlas Copco shares were up 6.6% by 1140 GMT following the results.\n\nThe company \u201creported a strong set of Q3 numbers\u201d, Carnegie analysts said in a research note, highlighting \u201cblow-out vacuum orders\u201d.\n\nOrder intake rose 6% organically to 27.1 billion crowns ($2.82 billion), beating analysts\u2019 forecasts of 25.1 billion.\n\nIts Vacuum Technique unit, whose client list includes Samsung (005930.KS), TSMC (2330.TW) and ASML (ASML.AS) and which makes up around a fifth of group orders, soared 21%, while Compressor Technique, its biggest business area, was up 7%.\n\n\u201cFor vacuum equipment to the semiconductor and flat panel industry, orders increased significantly, mainly driven by customers\u2019 investments in new production technologies,\u201d the company said.\n\nQuarterly operating profit rose to 5.84 billion crowns, up from 5.26 billion a year earlier, ahead of the 5.50 billion mean forecast from a Refinitiv poll of analysts.\n\nOrder intake in the Industrial Technique unit, which holds the bulk of Atlas\u2019 automotive exposure, was down 4% organically.", "description": "Swedish engineering firm Atlas Copco reported forecast-beating third-quarter earnings and order bookings on Monday on the back of strong demand from chipmakers, sending its shares sharply higher.", "authors": ["Johannes Hellstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443308774&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0NN", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
