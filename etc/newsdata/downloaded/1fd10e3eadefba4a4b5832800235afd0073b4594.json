I\u2019m not talking about the clowns you see on TV, it\u2019s hard not to notice how far past the edge of sane they\u2019ve gone. I\u2019m talking about otherwise seemingly normal people infected by what cable news has done to them.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss CNN and MSNBC as fringe outfits preaching to the progressive choir because their ratings are an embarrassment compared to Fox News. But it\u2019s important to remember that the media is much larger than 2 substandard left-wing activist cable networks. While Fox dominates cable news, it is dwarfed by everything else. And it\u2019s what\u2019s going on in everything else that is bleeding into everywhere else.\n\nLiving inside the Beltway of Washington, DC, it\u2019s good to get outside that bubble and visit \u201creal America\u201d as often as possible. It\u2019s not only healthy to relax every once in a while, it\u2019s necessary to see what the people who pay the bills are talking about and important to note the differences between those topics and what people inside the bubble are talking about.\n\nOn that trip to the ocean, we\u2019d gone to dinner on the boardwalk with the kids at dusk. Nice place. By the time we\u2019d finished, it was after sunset and were walking back to our hotel. The boardwalk was still a little crowded, even for a Monday night. As we were approaching our street with the 11-month-old in the stroller and the 2-year-old on my shoulders, a pair of couples came walking up behind us, talking as couples do. But one of the guys was loud.\n\nThey had to be in their mid-50s and didn\u2019t seem drunk, at least by how they were all able to walk a straight line and weren\u2019t slurring their speech. But the guy who was loud was angry too. \u201cThese f*#king Nazi rallies on TV, I f*#king hate these people,\u201d he bellowed.\n\nAfter a few more f-bombs and references to President Trump and Republicans, he then called just about everyone a racist. \u201cThey had all these f*#king crackers in Georgia f*#king everything up,\u201d not noting the irony of his own middle-aged whiteness.\n\nI thought about doing what I\u2019d always done in situations like that \u2013 saying something snarky loud enough for him to hear \u2013 even something as simple as pointing out how he needs to diversify his obscenity portfolio \u2013 but with a child wrapped around my head, I thought better of it. It\u2019s not a good look to get arrested with your kids. So I shot him an eye-rolling, head-shaking look and we turned the corner.\n\nImmediately after, my wife asked me something that hadn\u2019t occurred to me before, but was telling, \u201cHave you ever randomly overheard a Trump supporter angrily talking about any Democrat?\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t. Not just a Trump supporter, but I don\u2019t recall ever overhearing any Republican heatedly attacking a liberal politician or policy. My friends and I have done it, certainly, but either at parties or some other private setting. Never just walking around or sitting in a restaurant.\n\nYet Democrats are so filled with rage that it\u2019s not uncommon, even in the real world outside the beltway, even at the beach.\n\nIt\u2019s not just my experience, people have been physically attacked for wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. And it\u2019s not just Trump supporters, people deemed to be insufficiently \u201cwoke\u201d have come under assault from coast to coast.\n\nPolitics has always evoked emotional responses from people, but rarely has it brought on psychosis. The election of Donald Trump crossed the Rubicon for the activist left, from the towers of power to the boardwalk at the beach. Many are now acting on instinct, almost a Pavlovian response, a \u201cTrump Tourette Syndrome\u201d that causes a loss of decency and self-awareness.\n\nAfter attacking any and every conservative they possibly could over old speeches, writings, and tweets, The New York Times published a piece decrying Trump supporters holding journalists to the same standards. They actually wrote, in a \u201cnews\u201d story, \u201cBut using journalistic techniques to target journalists and news organizations as retribution for \u2014 or as a warning not to pursue \u2014 coverage critical of the president is fundamentally different from the well-established role of the news media in scrutinizing people in positions of power.\u201d\n\nGod forbid they be held to the same standards they hold others to. God forbid they live the way they seek to impose on others.\n\nIt\u2019s good to get out of Washington and visit America. It\u2019s just a shame that liberals are bringing Washington to the rest of the country.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "On a recent trip to the beach in Delaware with .09/02/2019 3:15:41AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/248/ada3db04-2a91-499d-8dbf-9190ac9b68e6.jpg"}
