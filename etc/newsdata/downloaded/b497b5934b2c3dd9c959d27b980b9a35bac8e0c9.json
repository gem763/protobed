(Sean Kilpatrick/AP)\n\nOn the night that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau swept to his landslide victory in 2015, he said voters had chosen \u201ca government that believes deeply in the diversity of our country.\u201d\n\nIn the four years since, he has cast himself as a global standard-bearer for inclusion, making it the center of his political platform and public persona as few leaders have anywhere, ever. He swore in a diverse, gender-balanced cabinet. He admitted more than 25,000 refugees from Syria, and went to the airport to greet the first arrivals. His government put Viola Desmond \u2014 a black woman who spurred the end of segregation in Nova Scotia \u2014 on the 10-dollar bill.\n\nThere have been missteps \u2014 most notably, accusations this year that he pressured his attorney general, an indigenous woman, to cut a deal with a construction firm from his home province that had been charged with bribery.\n\nNow the emergence of images from years or decades ago in which Trudeau wore blackface or brownface have dealt the Liberal leader\u2019s assiduously crafted image and already shaky bid for reelection a potentially crippling blow.\n\n\u201cThis thing is a wildfire,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, chief executive of the polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs in Toronto. \u201cAll of a sudden there\u2019s just a picture, and you don\u2019t have to explain it. Everyone knows what it is.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberal Party has been locked in a tight race with Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservative Party ahead of the Oct. 21 vote. Canada\u2019s federal elections are often won or lost in the ethnically diverse middle-class suburbs outside Toronto and Vancouver, where a small percentage of disenchanted Liberal supporters switching their allegiance \u2014 or simply staying home \u2014 could swing the election.\n\n\n\nWest Point Grey Academy, a private school where Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau once taught, is seen in the Jericho Beach area of Vancouver. (Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters)\n\nThe Conservatives have been running election ads warning that Trudeau was \u201cnot as advertised.\u201d Now the images \u2014 two photos published Wednesday evening, and a video that emerged Thursday morning \u2014 appeared to validate the message.\n\nTrudeau, 47, apologized again Thursday for the incidents: A 2001 party at which he appeared with his face darkened and wearing a feathered turban, a high school performance in blackface to sing \u201cThe Banana Boat Song (Day-O),\u201d and a brief video in blackface that his campaign said was from the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cDarkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface,\u201d Trudeau said from Winnipeg in an appearance broadcast live across Canada. \u201cI should have understood that then and I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\n[Third incident of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in racist makeup emerges]\n\nThe images come just one month after Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog ruled that Trudeau broke ethics laws last year when he pressured then-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to pursue an out-of-court settlement with the SNC-Lavalin construction firm.\n\nThat incident triggered several high-profile resignations from government and blasted a hole through Trudeau\u2019s brand. Having sold Canadians on the promise of leadership beyond reproach and open to diverse views, he stood accused of backroom politicking, bullying Wilson-Raybould and being a fake feminist.\n\nSupport for Trudeau declined as the scandal unfolded early this year, but climbed again over the summer. Now he faces a new challenge.\n\nBalpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization of Canada, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the new images, but he doesn\u2019t think the prime minister is \u201cracist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us who are racialized minorities know what it feels like to be discriminated against,\u201d he said. \u201cBlackface and brownface really does mock our experience. We can\u2019t scrub our skin color off when the party is over.\u201d\n\nWilson-Raybould, who was booted from the Liberal caucus and is running for reelection as an independent, said Wednesday she was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the photos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud to be an indigenous person in this country, one that has experienced racism and discrimination,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable for anybody in a position of authority and power to do something like that.\u201d\n\nTrudeau first apologized Wednesday evening, after Time magazine published a photo from the 2001 party, which he said had an Arabian Nights theme. He said then there was also an incident from high school, the performance in blackface. Global News published the video, also involving blackface, on Thursday morning.\n\nTrudeau said Thursday he could not be \u201cdefinitive\u201d about whether there were more images or videos to come because he had not remembered some of the images that have surfaced. He said he had not talked about the incidents publicly because he felt \u201cembarrassed\u201d and had not understood his privilege.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that represents the person I\u2019ve become, the leader I\u2019ve tried to be,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his late father, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, wouldn\u2019t have been \u201cpleased\u201d with his behavior, but would feel that \u201ctaking responsibility for things is important.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not not the first time Trudeau has come under fire from critics who accuse him of acting one way in private and another in public, of being smug and sanctimonious, of being good at symbolism but bad at the follow-through.\n\nHis government implemented a price on carbon and declared a national \u201cclimate emergency,\u201d but bought an oil pipeline. He describes himself as a feminist, but his government has refused to block the sale of light-armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, a country condemned internationally for its treatment of women. He came to power promising electoral reform, but abandoned the promise once in office.\n\nLiberal lawmakers stood by Trudeau. Greg Fergus, vice chairman of the Canada-Africa Parliamentary Association and a Liberal member from Quebec, said he had spoken with the prime minister and accepted his apology.\n\n\u201cIf it happened last week, it would shock me to the core,\u201d Fergus told reporters in Ottawa. \u201cBut things that happened 20 years ago? Different time.\u201d\n\n[In Canada\u2019s election, running against Trump is good politics]\n\nOmar Yar Khan, who has served as a strategist for the Liberals, described cycling through several emotions when he saw the images: Anger, frustration, regret. He said they suggest \u201ca lack of judgment,\u201d but he didn\u2019t think Trudeau had \u201cany ill intent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Justin Trudeau and I worked with him,\u201d said Khan, a vice president of public affairs at Hill+Knowlton. \u201cI know the real Justin Trudeau isn\u2019t today what is represented in those images and I don\u2019t think the real Justin Trudeau is what is represented in those images even back then.\u201d\n\nKhan said that \u201cCanadians are inherently a forgiving bunch,\u201d but Trudeau will need to show contrition and talk about what he and his government are doing to address systemic discrimination.\n\nBricker said Trudeau has handed his opponents new ammunition.\n\n\u201cThe Conservatives are really motivated, and they really want Trudeau gone,\u201d Bricker said. \u201cThe Liberals were holding their noses a bit, even before today, and weren\u2019t as motivated. So this is a big problem for them.\u201d\n\nShachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, said her polling has shown that voters say Trudeau\u2019s tolerance, compassion and influence are strong points when compared with Scheer.\n\n\u201cThe outstanding question is will this be the political equivalent of necrotizing fasciitis and just eat away at political support for him,\u201d she said. \u201cFor his own political survival, this is not something that he can afford having follow him day after day, week after week on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nA key indicator, she said, will be how young voters, crucial to Trudeau\u2019s victory in 2015, react to the revelations. If they stay home or vote for a left-of-center party, he could find himself in trouble. She said there could be divisions in how different generations within Canada\u2019s minority communities view the photos and images.\n\nBlackface has a long history in Canada, and remained a common form of entertainment in schools, churches and community groups well into the 1970s. The composer of \u201cO Canada,\u201d the national anthem, Calixa Lavall\u00e9e, spent much of his early career performing in blackface in minstrel troupes in Canada and the United States.\n\nAmerican minstrels traveled often to Canada, and homegrown troupes also sprung up. Philip S.S. Howard, a professor at McGill University, wrote in a 2017 paper that this reveals \u201cthe Canada-U.S. border to be, in fact, quite porous to U.S.-style racism.\u201d\n\nContemporary instances of Canadians in blackface often garner attention here, but never involving a figure as prominent as Trudeau. In 2014, for instance, a Quebec theater featured an actor in blackface portraying then-Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban. College students are condemned nearly every year for dressing in blackface during campus Halloween parties.\n\nVoting by recent immigrants from West Central Asia and the Middle East rose by 22 percentage points from 2011 to 2015, according to government data. Voting by recent immigrants from Africa jumped 25 points.\n\nScheer said the emergence of the video Thursday morning showed Trudeau\u2019s apology the night before was \u201cbased on a lie.\u201d He said his campaign was approached with the video, and turned it over to reporters.\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, said the images were evidence of \u201ca pattern of behavior of making light of the struggles that people face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung kids are going to see not one, not two, but multiple images of the prime minister mocking their lived reality,\u201d he said.\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May said she felt \u201cphysically ill\u201d when she saw the photos.\n\n\u201cAt that point in his life, I think you\u2019d have to say he was unconsciously racist,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not say that the man I know today was a racist, but I couldn\u2019t have imagined that photo, either.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nMonths before Canada\u2019s election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s colorful mother takes the stage to tell all\n\nTrudeau launches Canada\u2019s election season dogged by scandal, Scheer\n\nCanada\u2019s Trudeau is down in the polls.
