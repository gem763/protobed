(Picture: BBC)\n\nAs viewers are introduced to the current case, we\u2019re also taken back in time to the 80s where another three children find themselves embroiled in a murder.\n\nAs the episode goes on, it comes to light that Rob was the only child to escape the killer back in the original case \u2013 but is he now trying to hunt down the same person who took the lives of his two friends all those years ago?\n\nIt\u2019s clear he is keeping his cards to his chest, and no one else knows about his secret \u2013 except Cassie, who keeps telling her fellow detective to hand over the investigation.\n\nHowever, it looks as though the duo decided to try and solve the crime \u2013 but will Rob come out the other end alive? Will he end up accused of the murders? Or will he run away from his troubles?\n\nAre the two cases linked?\n\nIs the first case connected to the second? (Picture: BBC)\n\nWe\u2019re almost immediately introduced to two different cases during the episode: The first being back in the 80s where three children explore the woods, with only one coming back out alive; while the other is set in the present day, where another child has been killed in the same location.\n\nAnd while at first the two unsolved mysterious aren\u2019t linked, Rob appears to connect the dots and starts to believe we may be chasing the same killer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the cases are linked, the Rob will have an insight into what might be going on, as it\u2019s hinted throughout that he was the only child to escape in the 80s.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not confirmed, the boy who manages to get out of the woods is then seen being given a fresh identity after leaving his hometown, and names himself \u2018Rob\u2019.\n\nIt could just be a coincidence that the lead detective shares the same name, but somehow we think not.\n\nIs the older sister involved?\n\nThere\u2019s something fishy going on (Picture: BBC)\n\nA teenage girl\u2019s body has been found on an altar in the middle of an archaeological site.\n\nAnd while people are starting to point fingers, and hunt down the killer, we can\u2019t help but feel that her older sister is somewhat involved \u2013 and it seems Cassie is also on the same wavelength.\n\nWhen they went round to inform the family of the tragic news, the sister was acting suspiciously, saying she didn\u2019t hear her younger sibling leave the house, and didn\u2019t like the idea of Rob being in her bedroom.\n\nWhile the third sister threw up after hearing about the death, the suspect didn\u2019t seem surprised one bit, and happily cleared up the sick, with Cassie.\n\nThere is definitely something odd about the whole family, and while we\u2019re not placing bets just yet, we\u2019re pretty sure the older sister knows more than she is letting on.\n\nWill Rob and Cassie fall in love?\n\nWhat\u2019s a murder mystery without a good romance? (Picture: BBC)\n\nCassie and Rob have such a good relationship, and part of us wants it to blossom into something more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s a good murder mystery without the addition of a romance going on in the background?\n\nThe pair appear to rely on each other a little too much, as Cassie is already starting to hint that she knows about Rob\u2019s mysterious past.\n\nThey also confide in each other in the middle of the night, have secret little inside jokes and well, they\u2019re both single.\n\nLet\u2019s see if things heat up between the pair, or if they\u2019re just very good detective friends.\n\nWhat goes wrong?\n\nSomething is going to go disastrously wrong (Picture: BBC)\n\nRob and Cassie are seen at the beginning of the episode drenched in mud and looked pretty worse for wear.\n\nAnd while they sit in the police office, the duo come to terms with the fact that they are to no longer see each other, before we\u2019re taken back in time to the start of their investigation.\n\nBut what could go so wrong that two people, who were thought were going to fall hopelessly in love, must never again cross paths in their lifetime?\n\nIf the two cases are linked, maybe Rob gets himself in so deep that he is left with the only option but to run away.\n\nIt may be found out that he was one of the children involved in the 80s case \u2013 and as he\u2019s the only one left alive, people might start to ask questions and accuse him of the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess we\u2019ll have to wait and see as Dublin Murders continues tomorrow at 9pm on BBC.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
