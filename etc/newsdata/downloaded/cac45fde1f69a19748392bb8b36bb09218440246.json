At the same time, the peak body Australian Marriage Equality continued to put pressure on politicians to legalise same sex-marriage without going to the polls.\n\nCouldn't afford to lose\n\nThe marriage campaign turned ordinary \u2013 albeit successful \u2013 fund managers and lawyers like Snow and Horne into accidental activists, fighting alongside long-term advocates like Anna Brown, a human rights lawyer, and Alex Greenwich, a state MP and protege of ultra-progressive Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore. Others on the board of Australians 4 Equality included Commonwealth Bank corporate affairs boss Andrew Hall, Foxtel corporate affairs boss Bruce Meagher, Qantas executive Andrew Parker, senior ANZ lawyer Adrian Kennedy and former JP Morgan banker Janine Middleton.\n\nTogether they found themselves fighting a battle they didn't want to fight but couldn't afford to lose, thrown multiple curveballs and even the odd headbutt.\n\nSnow sold his stake in the firm he founded, Whitehelm Capital, which managed $5 billion at the time, and started hiring people for the campaign. Horne, a former MinterEllison lawyer, went from looking after three young children at home to fundraising from individual donors. The couple also donated the seed funding to build the campaign, with Snow's father Terry also donating money to the campaign later.\n\nThe government's announcement in August 2017 to hold a postal survey came as a surprise to many. Less than a year earlier newspaper headlines claimed the plebiscite dead after Labor caucus agreed to block any such proposal in the Senate. This time, the government would bypass the Senate by holding a $122 million postal survey. It would be conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a body responsible for the census disaster in 2016 and wrong jobs data in 2014. And participation in the survey would be voluntary, which meant the campaigners had to work hard on getting people to vote.\n\nThe Yes campaign would be built around the key messages of equality and fairness, which veteran political pollster Tony Mitchelmore found resonated with Australians more than messages like \"Love is love\" (popular with the core Yes base, but less so with the \"soft\" Yes voters) and \"Do it for someone you know\" (too shallow a reason to vote Yes).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe High Court challenge\n\nOn August 29 the No campaign's first television ad aired, featuring three mothers expressing concerns about the impact same-sex marriage would have on children. The next day the Yes campaign went on the defensive, getting high-profile doctor Kerryn Phelps to hit back at the mothers' claims as being misleading.\n\nThe first showdown seemed to put the Yes campaign on the back foot, and the controversy garnered free publicity for the No campaign.\n\nBrooke Horne (left) and Tom Snow with their children, twins Angus and Sybilla and dog Salty in 2012. Isabella Moore\n\nBut Mitchelmore reckons most people saw straight through the No ad. \"The argument about kids wearing dresses was fake news, disingenuous and they knew it,\" he says.\n\nThe period between the announcement and the High Court challenge was one of the darkest periods for the campaign. Former High Court judge and and marriage advocate Michael Kirby publicly came out against the postal vote, saying he would take no part in the process. For the last time the Yes campaign tried to stop the polls by challenging the legality of it in the High Court. It was difficult to fundraise when they were unsure whether there would be a campaign at all.\n\n\"I saw it as something we absolutely had to do before we went forward with the campaign. It was good to have that certainty from the High Court,\" Brown says.\n\nAfter losing the High Court challenge, the Yes campaign had no option but to get on with winning the votes. Within minutes of the decision, the Yes campaign unveiled its \"let's get it done\" television campaign featuring Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe, gay rugby group Sydney Convicts, and other members of the LGBTI community. Mitchelmore says the message appealed to people who felt disdain at politicians for dragging the issue on for too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Snow in 2014, founder Access Capital Advisors (later changed its name to Whitehelm Capital as part of a merger). Nic Walker\n\nBut what really won over the younger demographic was the social media campaign. People shared photos of themselves filling out the survey form and posed for selfies in front of the postbox. Mitchelmore recalls a focus group with younger voters and asking them if they had seen the marriage equality TV ads. Their response: \"What ads?\"\n\nMarred by controversies\n\nThe campaign also focused on getting the vote out. Traditionally in Australia, political campaigns are about winning the hearts and minds of middle Australia: the swing voters in marginal electorates. But with the support for marriage equality being so high among voters under the age of 35, Mitchelmore found the campaign could achieve more success by getting them to vote Yes, rather than trying to persuade the No voters to vote Yes. On the final days of the campaign, when you could only hand-deliver the ballot form, Greenwich and other volunteers stood outside of the ABS offices to make sure nobody got lost.\n\nDespite Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull pleading with both sides to campaign respectfully, the campaign was marred by controversies. A big media storm broke in the second week of the survey, after Abbott claimed he was headbutted by a Yes voter. (The attacker later said the incident had nothing to do with marriage equality.)\n\n\"When I heard we had an incident of violence my heart sank,\" says Brown. \"We've worked so hard to foster and promote a tone of the campaign that was all about positive conversations and for this to happen was really quite horrifying.\"\n\nTom Snow and Brooke Horne got married in New Zealand in 2014. Supplied\n\nOnly two days later, the Yes campaign was swept by another media storm when it sent out text messages to automatically generated numbers, urging voters to \"help make history and vote YES for a fairer Australia\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a divisive strategy. Some took to social media to sound alarm bells about the invasion of privacy. That afternoon, campaign leader Alex Greenwich had to issue a statement defending the SMS messages.\n\nBut Greenwich maintains it was an important moment in the campaign, which drove 170,000 people to click on the link and seek information about the survey on the marriage equality website and another 20,000 to sign up to volunteer.\n\nStay positive\n\nIt was important for the Yes campaign to stay positive. A classic election campaign would involve slagging off the other side, but with many No voters already feeling like they could not express their views without being stigmatised, any negative comments could backfire.\n\n\"Any name calling was going to hurt our campaign and get the No vote out, because of the resentment among the No voters,\" Mitchelmore says.\n\nOverall, Mitchelmore puts down the success of the Yes campaign to the fact it was a mainstream campaign which included gay and straight people. One of the key figures behind the Yes campaign was Janine Middleton, a former JP Morgan banker and a married, straight woman who helped to get more than 800 corporates on board.\n\nMiddleton says very few corporates gave cash, but the fact they signed up to the campaign and provided in-kind support helped to make the campaign appealing to middle Australia.\n\n\"They are household names and they gave us the support of the mainstream Australia, which you can't put a price on,\" she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Snow family lit up the Canberra Airport in rainbow in August 2015 to show support for same sex marriage. Graham Tidy\n\nThe last curveball moment was when Senator James Paterson, an Institute of Public Affairs alumni, introduced a bill two days before the result's announcement allowing businesses such as bakers and florists to discriminate against gay weddings on \"conscientious grounds\".\n\nRight balance\n\nIt was a blow for Brown, who had been working for a long time to make sure the competing Dean Smith bill struck the right balance between LGBTI rights and religious freedom. She feared bargaining away many hard-won LGBTI rights in order to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Out of the blue we had this bill land on our desk. It was so legally unorthodox and really represented a dramatic winding back of the discrimination protections we fought for years. We certainly didn't want to start to unpick them through achieving marriage equality,\" she says.\n\nThe Paterson bill was killed off on the day of the announcement, but the reincarnations of the bill continued to haunt the debate up until the very last minute as politicians proposed amendments.\n\nThe 61.6 per cent Yes win on November 15 was one of the biggest political mandates in recent electoral history, but there were doubts throughout the campaign. Even though the polls consistently indicated a decisive Yes win (pollster John Stirton said Yes was unbeatable \"unless a lot of people are straight out lying\"), the inaccurate polling in Brexit and the election of Donald Trump loomed large in the minds of the campaigners.\n\nThe Yes campaigners spoke to mental health groups in advance to prepare for a No result. On the announcement day, the campaign had two speeches prepared for Yes and No outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We knew that complacency would kill us,\" says Horne, when asked about the polls. \"We couldn't change the numbers one way or another. All we could do was make sure that we kept on having the conversations that we knew worked.\"\n\n\"What I was worried about was the turnout,\" says Snow. So he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the high participation numbers, which closed at nearly 80 per cent.\n\nOlympic swimmer Ian Thorpe was an ambassador for the marriage equality campaign.\n\nBut in many ways the marriage campaign was different from Brexit or Trump. The margin was much bigger than it was in Brexit (Leave won by a 52-48 margin), and when Mitchelmore did focus groups, he found there was not much switching between Yes and No votes. \"There was a sense that this is just not such a big deal, let's just get on with it.\"\n\nDespite leading one of the most successful social reforms of our time, there is a sense of bitterness towards politicians among the campaign leaders.\n\n\"It's an unprecedented process, to deal with people's rights like this,\" says Snow. \"It should have never happened.\"\n\nMulticultural groups\n\nThe Yes campaign itself is not free from criticisms. There is a sense the campaign, in a bid to target mainstream Australia, neglected to effectively target the ethnically diverse communities in Western Sydney (of the 17 electorates that voted No, 12 were in western Sydney).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreenwich acknowledges there were difficulties in targeting multicultural groups in western Sydney. \"With the new migrants from very conservative countries, even the conversation about what it means to be a gay person was new. So talking about same-sex marriage was always going to be really hard,\" he says. \"Definitely the lesson learnt is we need to make sure we're supporting the LGBTI communities in western Sydney.\"\n\nLess clear is the way ahead for the marriage equality campaign. The vehicle that only a month ago had 15,000 volunteers has largely been dissolved and the staff and volunteers packed up and left the campaign's temporary headquarter in Barangaroo International Tower in Sydney to get back to their day jobs. Questions remain over whether the campaign still has a role in persuading the nearly 40 per cent of voters who voted No in the campaign.\n\nFor the time being, Snow and Horne have friends' weddings to go to, engagement gifts to buy. A holiday is needed. While the passing of the bill will automatically validate their marriage (the couple got married in New Zealand in 2014), another ceremony in Australia may be on the cards.\n\n\"I think it is time to take a break and reassess\", Snow says.\n\nFormer JP Morgan banker Janine Middleton addressed the National Press Club of Australia in Canberra alongside veteran Irish marriage equality advocate Tiernan Brady in September.
