Ford is aligned with VW.\n\nHonda is already the industry\u2019s most fuel-efficient carmaker.\n\nGM, on the other hand, doesn't think California's plan provides enough EV emissions credits to offset the sale of high-margin pickups it needs to finance its bets on future technologies like autonomy.\n\nSome foreign automakers, especially, are worried about angering Presdient Trump, who is still weighing big tariffs on auto imports that could wreak havoc on their business.\n\nWhy it matters: California is the nation's biggest auto market and about a dozen states follow its lead on emissions rules.\n\nAutomakers want to avoid a split national market, but they're at odds over how to get there \u2014 and how stringent the single standard should be.\n\nPlus, transportation is the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe auto industry started balking a few years ago at stringent Obama-era standards that extend through 2025, but they don't like the draft 2018 White House plan to freeze the standards, and instead say there should be some level of annual increases.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"The automakers that made a previous deal with California may be questioning their actions if Trump wins a second term and successfully revokes California\u2019s ability to set its own standards,\" Autotrader executive publisher Karl Brauer tells Axios.\n\n\"Ultimately there\u2019s no clear path here, and every manufacturer taking a position on this topic risks being on the losing side when it\u2019s finally resolved,\" he said.\n\nWhat's next: Look out for final EPA and Transportation Department rules to revise the Obama-era standards.\n\nEPA has hinted that the final version require slight increases.\n\nBut that's extremely unlikely to satisfy California regulators, allied states and environmentalists, so look for this battle to drag on.\n\nThe state of play: A new note from the Rhodium Group helps explain why there's so much interest in the Trump vs. California fight \u2014 especially as it applies to the electric vehicle industry.\n\nWhat they did: The research firm modeled two scenarios out to 2035.\n\nKeeping Obama-era rules and California's waiver, which enables the state and others that follow its lead to adopt its zero-emissions vehicles rule. Revoking the California waiver and implementing Trump's plan to freeze the Obama-era standards.\n\nWhat they found: Freezing the standards and yanking the waiver would knock 7%\u20138% off nationwide ZEV sales \u2014 largely electric models \u2014 in 2035 relative to keeping the programs.\n\nThat means 12\u201314 million fewer ZEVs on the nation's roads in 2035 compared to keeping the tougher rules, Rhodium said.\n\nThree-quarters of the sales reduction stems from weaker mileage rules, while the balance is from rolling back the California ZEV rule.\n\nThe bottom line: It underscores how policy is a key driver of EV adoption rates, even as more \u2014 and more affordable \u2014 models enter the market.", "description": "Automakers want to avoid a split national market, but they're at odds over how to get there.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/aTgnI8zCQytKUWGTk2HASUmEyeg=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/29/1572357467568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
