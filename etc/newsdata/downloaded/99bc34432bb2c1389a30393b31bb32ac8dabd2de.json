That hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\nThe rollout of legal cannabis in Canada has been hampered by a number of factors, Alan Brochstein, author of 420 Investor, said this week on Benzinga\u2019s PreMarket Prep show.\n\n\u201cThey should have opened up medical dispensaries first and gotten that distribution out there,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead they waited until it was fully legal, and then each province did it differently. So you have a situation right now where there just aren\u2019t enough retail stores.\u201d\n\nFor example, Canada\u2019s most populous province, Ontario, has just 24 cannabis shops, according to BNN Bloomberg.\n\nThe average price of cannabis from Canada\u2019s legal producers is $10.23 per gram, while in the illegal market consumers can purchase it for an average of $5.59 per gram, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nThat price differential has risen by about 10% since the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
