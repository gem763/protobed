I did not feel sea sick once,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nThunberg made the trip across the Atlantic to attend a United Nations climate summit taking place in September \u2014 and she did it without leaving a carbon footprint. She traveled aboard the Malizia II, which has its own solar panels and hydro-generators to power the yacht. (Her journey did spark some criticism for the emissions associated with it because others will fly to New York to bring the yacht back to Europe, although those flights will reportedly be offset.)\n\nThunberg has become a leading figure among young activists\n\nSixteen-year-old Thunberg has incited students across the globe to strike for the climate. She started skipping school to protest climate inaction outside Swedish Parliament in August 2018. Since then, tens of thousands of young people have joined in on the movement, walking out of class on coordinated \u201cFridays for the Future.\u201d\n\nThunberg has become a leading figure among young activists concerned that they will bear the brunt of the climate crisis created by generations before them. Realizing the future ahead of her, Thunberg told the crowd gathered in Manhattan that she became depressed at 11 years old. \u201cI got out of that depression by promising that I\u2019m going to do everything I can to change things. I started going to marches and demonstrations,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nThunberg said that she will miss the \u201cpeace and quiet\u201d she had sailing across the Atlantic, but is looking forward to being dry, and eating food that isn\u2019t freeze-dried after two weeks at sea. She has another journey ahead of her later this year: traveling to Santiago, Chile by bus, train, and boat for another United Nations climate conference in December.\n\nIn the meantime, she\u2019ll be gearing up for the UN summit in New York in September. She told the gathered crowd that she planned to \u201cmake sure that world leaders have all eyes on them during this conference \u2014 so they cannot continue to ignore this.\u201d", "description": "Greta Thunberg made the trip across the Atlantic to attend a United Nations climate summit taking place in September \u2014 and she did it without leaving a carbon footprint.", "authors": ["Justine Calma", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEhPbN6sjcv93rzihYwlw8pV0nE=/0x321:4000x2415/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19127273/1164561687.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
