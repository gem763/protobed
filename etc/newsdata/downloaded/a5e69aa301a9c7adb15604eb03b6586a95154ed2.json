The book explores the ocean of air above us and its various forms.\n\n\"From the roaring winds of Katrina to the frozen oceans of Snowball Earth, Dewdney entertains as he gives readers a long overdue look at the very air we breathe,\" said the prize in a press release.\n\nPeter McMahon and illustrator Josh Holinaty are shortlisted in the young reader category for The Space Adventurer's Guide. This book for kids aged 8 to 12 imagines vacations taken on locales like the moon, Jupiter and Mars.\n\n\"The book begins with an introduction to current advances in space travel (including the current cost of a rocket trip), how astronauts train for a trip to space and a guide to key space lingo that will have kids talking like an astronaut in no time,\" said the prize in a press release.\n\nErica Fyvie and illustrator Bill Slavin's Trash Revolution is also on the shortlist. The book explores the life cycle of everyday objects, showing readers aged eight to 12 what happens to the things we mindlessly throw away or recycle.\n\n\"The topic of trash is timely, as our land and oceans are overwhelmed with garbage and plastic,\" said the prize in a press release.\n\nEtta Kaner and illustrator Carl Wiens are nominated for Wild Buildings and Bridges. This book shows 30 examples of the ways nature has inspired architecture.\n\n\"Kaner tells us how architects are inspired by the elements of nature and are using their designs to solve concerns such as saving energy, recycling and design challenges,\" said the prize in a press release.\n\nThe two winners will be announced on Oct. 28, 2019 at a dinner in Toronto.\n\nLast year, Robert William Sandford won the adult category for Our Vanishing Glaciers, while writer Maria Birmingham and illustrator Ian Turner won the young reader category for their collaboration Biometrics.", "description": "Mitchell's book about electromagnetism is on the 2018 Lane Anderson Award shortlist.
