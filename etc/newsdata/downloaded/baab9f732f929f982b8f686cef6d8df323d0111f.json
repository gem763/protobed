Everyone\u2019s gulping down great lashings of CBD water, including Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who can\u2019t hydrate fast enough. We have been hanging out now for nearly two hours on the patio of Topanga Living, a little caf\u00e9 that\u2019s one of Zellweger\u2019s regular joints.\n\nAs she heads inside for more supplies \u2014 bottles of turmeric juice, tea, and more fancy water \u2014 a young dude a couple of tables away leans over. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to make this weird,\u201d he says, \u201cbut is that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger?\u201d The actress, meanwhile, has stopped to talk to a lesbian couple with a tiny dog sitting near the door. They are earnest in the extreme and seem not the least bit starstruck, which makes me think they have no idea who she is \u2014 just some nice lady in Capri tights and running shoes with a voluminous scarf draped around her neck.\n\nWhen Zellweger gets back to our table, I express surprise that the couple didn\u2019t get movie-star dopey, and she says, \u201cNope.\u201d A big smile spreads across her face. \u201cI have very authentic exchanges with people once again.\u201d She stares at me for a second and then screws up one of those great Ren\u00e9e Zellweger faces. \u201cThankyouverymuch,\u201d she says, sort of doing Elvis if he were from Texas. \u201cSix years. It was important, that time. You\u2019re not in people\u2019s consciousness anymore, so they don\u2019t immediately make the connection. It\u2019s a quieter life, and I love it.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, Zellweger had anything but a quiet life. You could blame 1996\u2019s Jerry Maguire, which took her from ing\u00e9nue to star. Or maybe the Bridget Jones movies of the early aughts, which further solidified her image as a relatable Everywoman but which also turned her into tabloid prey right at the moment when newsstands began to look like Warhol installations, giant checkerboards of the same woman on the cover of every magazine, from Us and InTouch to Vogue and Elle. Who could look away from a star gaining and losing weight for a role in plain sight?\n\nZellweger dated rock stars and movie stars and was a genuinely fascinating creature of that last great Hollywood moment before it all became one big smelly sweat sock of adolescent-boy entertainment. She was effortlessly soign\u00e9e on the red carpet, the darling of fashion editors. And she was a star for Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Miramax: Her three Oscar nominations came for films, Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, Chicago, and Cold Mountain, that he had produced. It was an era that, in some ways, couldn\u2019t have been crueler to actresses, but also one that allowed them to play challenging parts in prestige films. Zellweger, perhaps, experienced the highs and the lows as acutely as anyone.\n\nAnd then, in 2010, after a series of duds and ill-conceived roles, she stepped off the merry-go-round \u2014 stopped making movies, wearing daring dresses to premieres, doing big interviews. She briefly came out of hiding in 2014 to attend the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards, and the press focused almost entirely on what the internet presumed was plastic surgery that had rendered her unfamiliar looking. She handled it with grace and eventually wrote an essay for HuffPost, criticizing the media scrutiny, called \u201cWe Can Do Better.\u201d In 2016, she eased back into movies, including Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby, and has been quietly, steadily working ever since. This month, the film Zellweger has chosen for a proper comeback, Judy (as in Garland \u2014 a biopic), comes out. It is a brave decision on so many levels \u2014 the challenge of singing like Garland, of playing a woman who, at 46, looked much older \u2014 not least because the ways Garland struggled with loneliness, insomnia, and the tolls of show business in general resonate with some of Zellweger\u2019s own struggles, even if hers are not remotely as volcanic as Garland\u2019s were.\n\nStepping back, Zellweger says, was crucial. \u201cI wasn\u2019t healthy. I wasn\u2019t taking care of myself. I was the last thing on my list of priorities.\u201d She has seen a therapist during only one period of her life, she tells me, and it was back then, as she retreated from acting. \u201cHe recognized that I spent 99 percent of my life as the public persona and just a microscopic crumb of a fraction in my real life. I needed to not have something to do all the time, to not know what I\u2019m going to be doing for the next two years in advance. I wanted to allow for some accidents. There had to be some quiet for the ideas to slip in.\u201d\n\nOne day around this time, she ran into her friend Salma Hayek in an airport. \u201cShe shared this beautiful \u2026 metaphor? Analogy? \u2018The rose doesn\u2019t bloom all year \u2026 unless it\u2019s plastic.\u2019 \u201d She levels me with a look. \u201cI got it. Because what does that mean? It means that you have to fake that you\u2019re okay to go and do this next thing. And you probably need to stop right now, but this creative opportunity is so exciting and it\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime and you will regret not doing it. But actually, no, you should collect yourself and, you know \u2026 rest.\u201d\n\nThanks to the shrink, she realized she was depressed. \u201cNothing like international humiliation to set your perspective right!\u201d she says with a mordant laugh. \u201cIt clarifies what\u2019s important to you. And it shakes off any sort of clingy superficiality \u2026 that you didn\u2019t have time for anyway. One of the fears that maybe, as artists, we all share \u2014 because we have this public experience of being criticized not just for our work but as human beings \u2014 is when it gets to be too much, when you learn that your skin is not quite as thick as you need it to be, what is that gonna feel like? Well, now I know. I got the hardest kick. And it ain\u2019t the end.\u201d But she also wants to be perfectly clear: The rough patch only lasted a year. \u201cI had a good five-year period when I was joyful and in a new chapter that no one was even aware of.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Amanda Demme for New York Magazine. Shirt by Urban Zen.\n\nZellweger hadn\u2019t planned on any of this. She was an English major at the University of Texas at Austin in the early \u201990s. She thought she was going to be a writer, maybe a journalist, but an acting class in her junior year led to a role in a student\u2019s thesis film based on a Flannery O\u2019Connor short story, in which she played a girl full of wanderlust who winds up in a boardinghouse contemplating suicide. \u201cThere was this scene on the bathroom floor where she\u2019s in such deep despair,\u201d she told me when I first wrote about her years ago. \u201cAnd as we filmed it, I was just dumbfounded. It was so much more than I had expected it could be, and I didn\u2019t know where it was coming from or why it was so important to me to return to that bathroom and do it again. From that point, I didn\u2019t care where it was going, I just knew I wanted to do that.\u201d\n\nBefore long, she was the \u201cGirl in Blue Truck\u201d in Dazed and Confused, then did Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, both starring Matthew McConaughey, who remains a good friend (she does a pitch-perfect imitation of him). She had memorable turns in Reality Bites and Empire Records \u2014 Gen-X indie classics \u2014 but she really blasted off when she co-starred with Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire. Right out of the gate, she got saddled with one of the most indelible lines in modern cinema \u2014 \u201cYou had me at hello.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overestimate the deleterious effect this sort of thing can have on an actor. It gives strangers permission to invade your boundaries everywhere you go \u2014 they shout it at you in airports and hotel lobbies. And then, in quick succession, she made a bunch of interesting comedies: the underrated Nurse Betty (for which she won her first Golden Globe), Me, Myself & Irene, and Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary. Jones is officially a classic, pure Zellweger goofball magic. She is so identified with the role that there\u2019s an entire generation of women who assume she is a clumsy, befuddled mess with food on her sweater. After that came the Oscar juggernaut Chicago, which led to her second nomination and the semi-comedic role of Ruby in the Civil War drama Cold Mountain, for which she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. But that was followed by another Bridget Jones, then a string of films you\u2019ve probably never heard of, and her retreat \u2014 just as she was entering those years in which Hollywood doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with actresses whose talent they don\u2019t entirely understand.\n\n\u201cNone of it I regret,\u201d Zellweger says. \u201cThough a lot of it? No thank you.\u201d She lets out a honking laugh. \u201cIf I could remember more of it, that would be nice, because my 30s are a blur. I think I just didn\u2019t sit still long enough to actually let anything soak in. People are like, \u2018Remember that time we \u2026?\u2019 and I have absolutely no recall about the thing at all. What\u2019s my girlfriend say? The file cabinet is bound to get full at some point, and something\u2019s got to fall out the back.\u201d\n\nWe talk for a moment about how she gets nervous for young actresses who are obviously going from film set to film set and look slightly unhinged on the red carpet \u2014 with barely masked terror in their eyes. \u201cYou can see how vulnerable they are,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not grounded, how can you have boundaries?\u201d You can\u2019t just grind on forever, I say. \u201cWell, you can,\u201d she replies. \u201cBut then you\u2019re really unhealthy and unbalanced and, you know, about to die. And then you look back on it and wonder what happened. And where are the relationships that you didn\u2019t have a chance to nurture?\u201d She continues: \u201cI had lots of different places to live but no home. No home where I actually unpacked pictures and put them on the shelf \u2026 I had two suitcases. I knew where my passport was, I knew where my important papers were \u2014 the inoculations, all that stuff, were in my carry-on, all the time. Now I put the carry-on up on a shelf!\u201d Here she lets rip with another one of those patented laughs \u2014 full-throated, head back \u2014 and everyone on the patio looks over and realizes who she is.\n\nI first met Zellweger during this peripatetic period in her life: on a soundstage in Toronto in February 2002 \u2014 the set of Chicago. I was writing a piece about the making of that film, but Zellweger avoided everyone when she wasn\u2019t in a scene, including me; it was the first film, I would later learn, where she\u2019d figured out that it was just easier if she kept to herself and stayed in character all day. I would see her going in and out of her trailer, in Uggs and a puffy coat, so thin, clutching a cup of tea, hugging herself against the cold, being cheerful and unfailingly polite but never stopping long enough to truly engage. She was a blur. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Zellweger and I would eventually all have dinner in Manhattan a couple months later. Zeta-Jones showed up late in a leather trench coat and a cloud of perfume and ordered a rare steak and Champagne. Zellweger arrived very early \u2014 in her running clothes \u2014 and ate steamed spinach.\n\nA year and a half later, as I was writing a profile of Zellweger for the release of Cold Mountain, I met her one July afternoon at the Mercer Hotel, and she kept me waiting in the lobby for nearly an hour. She was dating Jack White at the time and admitted to me that she\u2019d been up all night with him and some friends in their suite. I remember thinking: Is she on drugs? It just didn\u2019t make sense, given the clean-machine approach, the constant running, the healthy eating. Was she in love? \u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask myself, don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d A week later, I was on a plane to London, where Zellweger was preparing to play Bridget Jones once again. She had the flu and was wrapped in a blanket, clinging to a cup of tea as if her life depended on it. Despite the illness, she was hilarious and smart, and we talked for hours in a dark hotel-lobby bar. She was gaining weight to play Jones, and her assistant kept bringing her little bowls of food every half-hour: potato chips mostly, but also doughnuts.\n\nBack then, she couldn\u2019t stop buying up old houses. There was the townhouse on the Upper East Side, the big pile on the East End of Long Island. She was searching, she tells me now. \u201cI did a where-are-you-supposed-to-live tour around 2003. I started in New York City and I had just a toothbrush in my purse and drove all the way out to the Cape.\u201d She stopped along the way in towns in Connecticut and New York and Massachusetts, eventually buying a farm in the very far-northwestern corner of Connecticut, in the same town where her brother Drew, to whom she is exceptionally close, had moved with his wife and two kids.\n\nIt must be said: Zellweger looks great; she looks like herself again. Whatever was going on that night on the red carpet a few years ago that made everyone think she had radically altered her trademark \u2014 her eyes, which are practically her calling card, so crinkly and comically expressive \u2014 was obviously temporary, because she looks, well, like Ren\u00e9e Zellweger at 50. But Hollywood 50, which is to say several years younger. When I tell her I am a little reluctant to bring up the \u201cwhole plastic-surgery kerfuffle\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it probably gives you a stomachache, asking me about that, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d There is a long pause. It\u2019s a difficult topic, I say. \u201cWell, because there\u2019s a value judgment that\u2019s placed on us. As if it somehow is a reflection of your character \u2014 whether you\u2019re a good person or a weak person or an authentic person,\u201d she says. I suggest to her that there was a kind of panic people felt that she somehow did not look like herself. \u201cAnd the implication that I somehow needed to change what was going on because it wasn\u2019t working,\u201d she says. \u201cThat makes me sad. I don\u2019t look at beauty in that way. And I don\u2019t think of myself in that way. I like my weird quirkiness, my off-kilter mix of things. It enables me to do what I do. I don\u2019t want to be something else. I got hired in my blue jeans and cowboy boots with my messy hair. I started working like that. I didn\u2019t have to change to work. So why was I suddenly trying to fit into some mold that didn\u2019t belong to me?\u201d\n\nPhoto: Amanda Demme\n\nDuring those years she wasn\u2019t making movies, Zellweger created and produced a television series \u2014 Cinnamon Girl, about four young women, musicians and artists, coming of age in Los Angeles in the late \u201960s \u2014 that did not get picked up. She traveled a lot, to places like Thailand and Liberia, which she visited with a friend from London who had started an organization that recognizes leaders who advocate for women\u2019s rights, in this case the country\u2019s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. She also went back to school, taking classes at a university in L.A. that she\u2019d rather not name because she\u2019s planning to continue: \u201cI was just interested in learning a little bit more about international policy, getting a little smarter about it all, to see if it was something I had an aptitude for away from the news on the television set. It was fantastic.\u201d\n\nI have been watching her pull on the very long, stretched-out sleeves of her threadbare shirt, putting her thumbs through holes she has created. What\u2019s up with that? I ask. \u201cI pull my sleeves down,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing I do. I play with my sleeves all day until there\u2019s holes in them.\u201d Suddenly, she puts her hands, which are covered by her sleeves, to her lips and starts massaging them. \u201cMmmmm. Mmmmm. Sorry. I\u2019m going through a moment here. With, like, fatigue on my face.\u201d Her plump lips seem to have gone slightly crooked at the moment. She gently massages them once more. \u201cWhat is that now? What now?\u201d And then says \u2014 I think \u2014 to her lips: \u201cYou may not invite any friends over. You\u2019re done,\u201d as if to punish them for their misbehavior.\n\nJudy, an adaptation of the Tony-nominated musical drama End of the Rainbow, is set in 1968, as Garland arrives in London for a five-week run of sold-out shows at the Talk of the Town nightclub \u2014 where, predictably, she succumbed to booze and pills and some nights couldn\u2019t perform, unless, of course, she was on and blew the roof off the place. The movie, which debuts at the Telluride Film Festival and opens on September 27, is directed by Rupert Goold, best known for staging Shakespeare as artistic director of the Almeida Theatre in London.\n\nThe film is good, not great \u2014 though it hardly matters because Zellweger is riveting as Garland, her best acting to date. She plays her as a spooked mess, both studied and utterly free, so intense you barely notice some of the more lachrymose Wizard of Oz flashbacks. She nails the way Garland, arms akimbo, hunched herself and chewed on her words: IsFrankSinatrahere? She ties herself into a pretzel, suffering alone in a hotel bathroom in the middle of the night, zonked on pills yet still unable to sleep. Zellweger even manages to conjure Garland\u2019s butch aspect \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d \u2014 and that slacks-and-a-blouse march in kitten heels down the long hallway that leads to the stage on opening night.\n\nI ask Zellweger how she approached playing Garland, and she answers with one word: \u201cDenial\u201d (a snappy retort right out of the Garland playbook). \u201cI felt like we never actually did it. We were talking about seeing what we might be able to do. Every day. Just try that. Try and see what this feels like and what does that hair color look like, let\u2019s try this kind of makeup and then let\u2019s try these songs, with this kind of orchestration. Let\u2019s try to emulate this year and this less successful evening in her life,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of it was, like, dentist rage. You know that dentist rage? Where you don\u2019t have a choice? YOU. JUST. HAVE. TO. DO. IT.\u201d She bangs her fist on the table between each word. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re so glad that you did? That\u2019s what it was like.\u201d\n\nZellweger on the set of Judy. Photo: Courtesy of Path\u00e9 Productions/Path\u00e9 Productions\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big ask to play Judy Garland,\u201d says Goold. \u201cThe Scandinavian-looking, blonde, diminutive Bridget Jones wasn\u2019t necessarily slam-dunk obvious.\u201d But when she came to London for a meeting in 2017, he was \u201cjust so taken by how bright she is.\u201d They spent three days around the piano at Abbey Road studios, \u201cjust feeling each other out, singing together. She\u2019s got a really good voice and a really good ear \u2014 great pitch, great phrasing. And I thought, She\u2019s got a long journey to travel, obviously, but this is a colleague I really want to work with. Yes, she needs to be able to sing, but that wit, that spiky intelligence, is No. 2. When you watch that old Garland footage from talk-show interviews \u2014 she\u2019s brilliant. Just when you think she\u2019s maybe spiraling away, she snaps back \u2014 really crisp and laserlike.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever see that Dick Cavett interview?\u201d says Zellweger, who spent months reading biographies and watching YouTube footage. (\u201cI\u2019m the queeeeen of the comeback,\u201d says Garland. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of coming back \u2026 I can\u2019t go to \u2026 the powder room without making a comeback.\u201d) \u201cShe\u2019s just off the charts. And she\u2019s gorgeous in that black dress, the way she saunters on, so playful, and hits the ball back and just aces!\u201d\n\nThe excellently named Finn Wittrock, who plays Garland\u2019s fifth and last husband, Mickey Deans, says, \u201cThere was such a palpable sense of loneliness with Judy, that sense that she gave more to life than it gave back to her, of being drained and world-weary \u2014 which is not, in my observation, something Ren\u00e9e has naturally. I don\u2019t know what her secret was, but it was like she was heavier than she is in real life, carrying a kind of grief around with her. And the way Ren\u00e9e played Judy, the grief doesn\u2019t come out as self-defeating; it comes out through comedy \u2014 but all her zingers are from a deep sense of sadness.\u201d\n\nJudy costume designer Jany Temime, best known for the Harry Potter films, says, \u201cRen\u00e9e was extremely emotionally and artistically involved in Judy. It was her film. I think she really got into Judy\u2019s skin.\u201d As close to literally as possible: Says Zellweger, \u201cJany fit the costumes to Judy\u2019s posture. So the dresses didn\u2019t fit me unless I stood like I was supposed to stand. The zipper wouldn\u2019t go up.\u201d Because of the film\u2019s budget constraints, Garland\u2019s Chanel bags and Dior scarves and jewelry came from Temime\u2019s mother\u2019s wardrobe.\n\nAs she had on the set of Chicago, Zellweger stayed in character. \u201cWe didn\u2019t call her Judy on set or anything, but she was pretty much transformed from the time we were called till we wrapped, so I rarely saw her step out,\u201d says Wittrock. \u201cBut it was, like, all the great sides of Judy and none of the diva because she was kind of a social butterfly. The AD would come get her to take her to set, and she would stop five times because she was asking the grip how his dog was. That kind of person.\u201d It was almost as if he never really met Zellweger until the very end. \u201cShe was always in the wig and had a bit of a prosthetic nose and dark contacts. It wasn\u2019t till the wrap party that she came out and she was blonde and wearing a stunning dress, and I was like, Oh, right. That\u2019s the movie star.\u201d\n\nZellweger, as herself, has that rat-a-tat-tat What\u2019s the news boys? aspect. Some of her stories have a kind of jazz to them; she sometimes launches herself into a riff, and you\u2019re not quite sure where it\u2019s going, but when it finally lands it always makes perfect sense, sometimes even profoundly so. Her texts are threaded through with a similar manic patter. When I told her I\u2019d spoken with her friend of 20 years the producer Neil Meron, she texted, \u201cSENSATIONAL adventures!! And getting Neil to drink a whiff of annnything would be another to top the list! Ha! Though if you succeed you gottttttta call! Comin running! \u2026with phone voice notes ON. Haha. He is a human treasure and I love and admire him so. We must share a table sometime soon! I\u2019ll bring the fire extinguisher.\u201d\n\nMeron, who produced Chicago and also made a miniseries on Garland\u2019s life starring Judy Davis, says he was surprised when Zellweger called with the news that she was going to tackle Garland. But then he remembered having dinner at Zellweger\u2019s house one night ten years ago and bringing a copy of Garland\u2019s last film, I Could Go On Singing, so he could show her \u201cthat famous scene where she\u2019s breaking down and it\u2019s kind of autobiographical and she\u2019s talking about what it\u2019s like to perform every night and be in public and all that, and I think it\u2019s some of the greatest acting I\u2019ve ever seen onscreen.\u201d (He is right: YouTube it and fasten your seat belt.) Zellweger had never seen the film and was \u201cmesmerized,\u201d says Meron.\n\nZellweger had a lot of dance and voice training on Chicago, but most of her songs were upper-register pretty \u2014 high and bright \u2014 so I was not fully prepared for her to plant-the-feet-and-belt, a kind of singing that Judy Garland all but invented. Meron is friends with Zellweger\u2019s vocal coach, Eric Vetro, \u201cand he was a little skeptical at first that she was doing her own singing in the film,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then he whispered to me one day: \u2018She\u2019s great.\u2019 She worked like a demon on her voice.\u201d As far as Goold is concerned, her anxiety about performing the Big Numbers as one of the greatest singers to ever tackle them \u201ctranslates onscreen into Judy\u2019s own anxiety about how the public received her up toward the end of her life.\u201d\n\nThe film highlights the fact that Garland wasn\u2019t just a drug addict. In fact, she was an insomniac, and it drove her mad and toward the pills. Zellweger thinks the insomnia is a crucial but neglected part of Garland\u2019s psychology. \u201cThose little bits of context that seemed to be discounted as unimportant, I think they were invaluable to me,\u201d she tells me. The sleeplessness is something Zellweger recognized all too well; she\u2019s the kind of insomniac who sometimes goes to the movies at midnight, the only person in the theater. \u201cI like to say that I\u2019m a night owl who gets up early. Because you gotta get up to go to work sometimes at 4 a.m. having gone to bed at 3 a.m. I get busy at midnight. I used to move the furniture around. Because you can\u2019t fix this but you can fix that.\u201d She laughs. \u201cOr laundry. I find laundry so satisfying because it brings some kind of order so I can feel, like, right: fresh, starting over, in peace. I like my laundry.\u201d\n\nWhen Zellweger talks about how Garland was a misunderstood figure, you can\u2019t help but hear echoes of her own struggles. \u201cThere was so much that was not allowed for. You\u2019re not allowed to be human. There\u2019s no room on the schedule for her sanity \u2014 the choices that were made for her and how she was exploited and \u2026 robbed, basically.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Amanda Demme\n\nToday, Zellweger seems totally in control. She just signed a two-year first-look deal with Stacey Levin, senior VP of development at MGM Television. \u201cStacey\u2019s a Staten Island girl,\u201d says Zellweger. \u201cI love her. I like her ideas and why she likes things.\u201d Zellweger has never had this kind of formal relationship with a studio before, but now she and her partner in the Big Picture Co., Carmella Casinelli, who have \u201cthree or four things, different genres, that are in varying stages of development\u201d \u2014 have, at long last, found a home. Among the many things she hopes to do at MGM is direct. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she says. \u201cI might not have been ready to do it 15 years ago, but I feel like I\u2019m ready now.\u201d\n\nMeron is convinced Broadway is in her future. \u201cNot immediately,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there will be a Broadway show starring Ren\u00e9e.\u201d When I mention this to Zellweger, she shouts, \u201cFrom his mouth to God\u2019s ear! Let\u2019s go!\u201d She laughs. \u201cHe and I have talked about it for years. We play around with little ideas \u2014 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t this be fun?\u2019 \u201d Meanwhile, on September 27, she has an album coming out: the original soundtrack to Judy, on which she duets with both Rufus Wainwright and Sam Smith. The lead single from the album features Zellweger \u2014 as Judy \u2014 singing \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, it must be thrilling to make a comeback \u2014 to start over \u2014 at this age, having skipped the years when Hollywood thinks you\u2019re too young for some roles and too old for others. Just head right into those delicious Meryl Streep parts \u2014 free at last from all the pressure of being the ing\u00e9nue. There is no vanity in playing Judy Garland in the last six months of her life, when wrinkles and bags and exhaustion must be added to your pretty face. But it also must be a bit daunting to re-stake your claim in a new Hollywood, an industry that has been utterly transformed by streaming and superheroes. It\u2019s worth noting that many members of that amazing class of actresses Zellweger was a part of, like Gwyneth Paltrow, have stopped making movies; others are being celebrated for their work in television, like Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, to name just two from one show.\n\n\u201cI think the majority of the films that I\u2019ve made wouldn\u2019t get made today,\u201d Zellweger tells me. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the business model is there to support it anymore \u2014 I guess that\u2019s what it comes down to. I feel lucky that I lived that moment, but I don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s different. We\u2019re minstrels. We play for our supper. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing more than ever now, and I don\u2019t mind! What I really love about it is that I\u2019m still allowed to do it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re pushing into hour No. 4 at Topanga Living. The lunch crowd has dispersed and you can just feel that the person wiping down the tables and putting up the chairs would probably like for us to maybe think about leaving. We have also moved to our third table, creeping across the patio to escape the sun, which is hovering just above the ridge. \u201cMy purse is melting,\u201d Zellweger says as we gather our things to move to that shadier spot over there. \u201cYour phone is so angry \u2014 just look at it. It\u2019s practically stuck to the table.\u201d\n\nWe sally forth onto a new topic, something I\u2019ve been wanting to not just bring up with her all day but understand for half my life: Why do certain women become gay icons? Judy Garland is the Ur-example of this bizarrely predictable routine, the mother of all troubled stars, both fragile and steely \u2014 catnip for the gays. And aren\u2019t all gay men just a little mortified when they realize they actually really do love Judy Garland? And Barbra Streisand? Ugh. And yet we relate to them on some ineffably cosmic level: the suffering, the need to put on a big show for everyone. Turns out, in the Venn diagram of Judy-Ren\u00e9e, you can add gay icon to the shaded-in area. From my unscientific polling, I have learned that most gay men love Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and are rooting for her \u2026 because: Roxie Hart, Bridget Jones, you had me at hello.\n\nI think the majority of the films that I\u2019ve made wouldn\u2019t get made today.\n\nGiven that Zellweger is playing Judy Garland, this comes up. \u201cIn England, I was speaking with this gentleman who edits this wonderful periodical and he said to me, \u2018What is your relationship to the gay community?\u2019 And I thought, Oh gosh, here we go!\u201d She had been asked these questions during a press junket a couple weeks earlier and wasn\u2019t quite prepared. \u201cNow I just sound like a jerk, because I don\u2019t think about it, which kind of sounds like, Oh, you\u2019re just indifferent to it. And it\u2019s completely the opposite! I had a very hard time answering his question. And then I thought, Well, what isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not a wife of, I\u2019m not a daughter of, and I\u2019m not a sister of or a mother of\u201d any gay men, she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m everything else. Everything else! I\u2019m the obvious: I\u2019m an ex-girlfriend of, I\u2019m a best friend of, I\u2019m a mentor of, I\u2019m a student of, I\u2019m a client of, a partner of, I\u2019m a neighbor, I\u2019m a boss, a collaborator. I\u2019m a patient. I\u2019m a customer. I\u2019m a constituent!\u201d\n\nZellweger really wants to dig deep with me about growing up gay \u2014 she is relentless in her pursuit, like the journalist she thought she was going to be before she fell into acting. Can you recognize now what you were afraid of that kept you closeted? Did you feel like it was your cross to bear? Were you in love with your first boyfriend? She asks: \u201cIf you were to list the characteristics of the gay men that you know, and obviously we\u2019re talking in a broad-spectrum way. But in the experience of coming up as a closeted gay person, how does it manifest in character? Are there common denominators?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of rage, I say. It surfaces in different ways. And there\u2019s a lot of stunted growth in the gay men that I know. Those are the negatives.\n\n\u201cMy experience of it as an observer is the opposite from that,\u201d she says. \u201cI see that they\u2019re sort of an earlier maturation. And I see that there is that determination that you\u2019re talking about, but it\u2019s not without thoughtfulness. What I witness is a more evolved level of empathy \u2014 having been on the receiving end of such unexpected and damaging unkindness \u2026 See, I\u2019m attracted to people who have had your experience.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that both Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli married gay men, I say, and here she makes the most complicated and hilarious face imaginable, one that seems to say, all at once, Haven\u2019t we all? And Go figure! \u201cCute\u2019s cute,\u201d she says. \u201cHandsome is handsome! Sweet is sweet. If it works \u2026 I mean \u2026 I mean! Sometimes it just doesn\u2019t really matter. It just dudn\u2019t. If there\u2019s a spark, it just is, and who needs to explain it?\u201d (At the moment, she\u2019s single, after a long relationship with a musician; her previous high-profile boyfriends include Bradley Cooper, Kenny Chesney, Jim Carrey, and George Clooney.)\n\nI bring up something I\u2019d been reluctant to: Weinstein. Zellweger had remained silent as #MeToo unfolded, but after the actress Melissa Sagemiller, in a class-action lawsuit filed in December 2017, claimed that Weinstein had told her that he\u2019d received \u201csexual favors\u201d from Zellweger and Charlize Theron, Zellweger fired back through a spokesperson: \u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of shit.\u201d\n\nThere is a very long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to talk about in this context. It\u2019s such a big topic. And it\u2019s personal and it\u2019s not. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s always been there and the shift is overdue and you could feel it coming for a while and it was inevitable. And thank God. But, in some ways, I feel: Oh gosh, I allowed for the tiny cuts that just seemed like, \u2018Oh, this is just how it\u2019s always been.\u2019 But I was never a victim of it.\u201d She says the word victim with clenched teeth. \u201cI always felt that I knew what to do in those circumstances. I didn\u2019t feel \u2026 accostable. I never felt that I was being insulted, demeaned. I didn\u2019t recognize it as that. It was jocular \u2014 it\u2019s a joke. And then there\u2019s that other side of it: that I love male-female banter, that playful dynamic. So, it\u2019s a big conversation. I\u2019m sure that I was on the receiving end of something that I don\u2019t even know about, in conversations that I wasn\u2019t privy to. But it wasn\u2019t something that I felt, it wasn\u2019t something that I was aware of. I was very surprised by some of the things that were unearthed. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nI tell her that people have been surprised to hear that I didn\u2019t know either, having written about and been around so many people in Weinstein\u2019s world. \u201cBut were you really around?\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t around it. I don\u2019t hang out like that. I don\u2019t go to the party. It\u2019s part of my work: There\u2019s a premiere, there\u2019s an event, there\u2019s a red carpet, there\u2019s the hotel-lobby dinner. That\u2019s my relationship to Hollywood. I don\u2019t live in that. That\u2019s my job. I visit it.\u201d\n\nBut then she says this about the whole awful season of the Weinstein revelations, one after another, right on the cusp of Hillary\u2019s being beaten by Trump: \u201cIt was a very hard thing to hear about. And it was hard to accept the surprise of that. And I\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s hard to talk about, because this is a person that I did not know well, but I thought I knew him as I knew him. It was red carpets and a hotel lobby in passing or \u2018I\u2019ll see you at this after-party\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ll be there to make sure you go to promote our movie\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ll see you at Cannes\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll see you at the French premiere\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll see you in the editing room so we can pick these things apart.\u2019 And that\u2019s a lot, when you talk about how we worked during that decade and a half \u2026\u201d She trails off and then worries that she\u2019s said too much.\n\nSometimes, Zellweger can\u2019t help herself \u2014 she just wants to talk. Way back in 2004, she was the first person I interviewed who cut out all the middlepeople and just gave me her phone number and email address. We stayed in touch for a few years and hung out at some parties; she would often text me out of the blue, just as she was landing in this or that city. Here\u2019s one from April 2006, about making the Beatrix Potter film: \u201cAll things potter this end! Nuthin like 3 months in the bizarrely creative shoes of a fiercely private ol\u2019 maid who keeps and converses more easily with mice and rabbits than london folk to make ye hanker hard fer some manolos and a fat night out in the apple!!\u201d\n\nAs soon as we went our separate ways after that long interview this early August, the texting picked right back up, including this gem from the other day: \u201cFound a Conway Twitty LP for $1.00 at Amoeba yesterday. The cover shot in green mesh izod shirt paired with white tennis shorts and trucker baseball hat is too remarkable. Seems he\u2019d FOUND himself in the 80\u2019s. And the hat didn\u2019t qqquite sit on the head, but rather perched pride-of-place atop a super coif. My young pal observed that the storied greedy eighties really were excessive\u2026 \u2018in the eighties you had a hat AND a hairdo.\u2019 Ha.\u201d There\u2019s something so wonderfully random and detailed about this missive \u2014 like reading someone\u2019s diary in real time.\n\nBack in Topanga, it\u2019s approaching 7 p.m. and still in the upper 90s. Zellweger has to drive all the way to Bakersfield to pick up her dogs. They stay there with her vet-tech friend DeAnn when she\u2019s out of town. We pile into her black Jeep so she can drive me back to my hotel in Beverly Hills and then shove on down the 5 into the desert. But first she\u2019s got to back out onto Topanga Canyon Boulevard in rush-hour traffic. She\u2019s got the Beatles on the stereo (\u201cI listen to the Beatles every day. Don\u2019t you?\u201d) and she\u2019s inching out onto the shoulder, looking left, then right, then left again, waiting for an opening. Why a Jeep, I ask. \u201cMudslides.\u201d And then funnier, in a thick Texas accent: \u201cMuuuuuudsliiiiiides.\u201d Did you have to escape the fires last fall?\n\n\u201cYes, I evacuated. Dogs in a van and off we went. Had to leave for a week. I\u2019ve never done that before, where you play the what-do-I-take-with-me game. Very interesting exercise. I became an increasingly superficial person as the threat diminished. By 5 a.m. I was like: I want those boots! Because you start with, you know, the dogs. And then I grabbed my dad\u2019s old typewriter that I used to write my grandparents letters on onion paper. And then I cleared out the desk drawers, because that\u2019s where the important papers are. And of course, I have my two bags ready to go at all times.\u201d She\u2019s still trying to back out onto the boulevard. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if we left during rush hour we wouldn\u2019t get anywhere anyway? Look to the right. Innit that the giggle?\u201d At long last, there\u2019s an opening with enough space for this high-risk maneuver. \u201c Look out, world!\u201d she says as she floors it and we lurch in reverse out into traffic. She waves to the cars that have had to slow their ride to let her out. \u201cSoooorrrry, everybody. Thank you, America!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d she says, pointing out her road. \u201cI live way over that ridge. Way over.\u201d What made her buy this particular house? \u201cLocation. It feels a little bit like West Texas. It\u2019s really remote. I like that it\u2019s solitude and silence. There\u2019s no cell service up there, so there\u2019s a different kind of peace that you don\u2019t know you\u2019re missing.\u201d Earlier, we\u2019d gotten into a conversation about the fact that we were both raised by practical fathers, men who liked to tinker and fix things, who taught us how to build a fence and change the carburetor on a Dodge Dart. \u201cThe things that our fathers nurtured in us seem to matter up there,\u201d she says, gesturing toward the ridge. \u201cI have to clean up messes and solve problems. I have to deal with the generator and the septic system and the water tank.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar Zellweger won for Cold Mountain was for playing Ruby, a tough, capable country girl who taught Nicole Kidman how to build fences, how to snap a chicken\u2019s neck and cook it for dinner. Strangely enough, that character is much closer to Zellweger than those dizzy, solipsistic Bridget Jones types. When the apocalypse comes \u2014 when a real fire rears up and burns everything down \u2014 I hope I\u2019m with Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, siphoning gas out of cars and eating candy bars to stay alive \u2014 trying to figure out how to start over.\n\nProduction Credits Photographs by Amanda Demme\n\nStyling by Petra Flannery\n\nHair by Richard Marin using Oribe\n\nMakeup by Kindra Mann at Tomlinson Management Group\n\nOn Ren\u00e9e: Trench coat by Juan Carlos Obando\n\nRings by David Webb\n\n*This article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
