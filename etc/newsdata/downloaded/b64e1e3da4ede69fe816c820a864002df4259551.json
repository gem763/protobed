So strong, in fact, that my faith is integral to everything I do, believe, think and feel. It\u2019s the foundation of my values, morals and it informs every decision I make in life. Intense, eh?\n\nI would bring my faith up when it felt natural and didn\u2019t force it into conversations (Picture: Jessica Evans)\n\nWhen I\u2019ve told people I\u2019m dating that I\u2019m a Christian, some have been put off \u2013 and understandably so.\n\nThe connotations around the word are that I\u2019m boring, old-fashioned, deluded, dowdy, self-righteous and hypercritical. Non-believers can sometimes see the church as a judgmental, harmful religious place, and think that Christians live on some kind of superior morality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the fragile, early days of getting to know someone, let alone trying to start something romantic, this is the last thing you want them to conjure up.\n\nI would bring my faith up when it felt natural and didn\u2019t force it into conversations. I\u2019ve had positive experiences dating both Christians and non-Christians and have been in love a few times with people of different faiths and beliefs.\n\nHowever, a few atheists I dated found it \u2018naive\u2019 that I believe in God. One date told me I had been brainwashed.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the question I would get asked by guys the most was \u2018what are your thoughts on sex before marriage?\u2019 Or rather, \u2018when can we have sex?\u2019 When I gave them my answer most men ran away. (Not literally\u2026 at least not all the time anyway.)\n\nI believe sex works the best within the safe place of marriage. For me, sex isn\u2019t just a physical and emotional act, but a spiritual one that exceeds a certain level of intimacy. I can\u2019t ever just see sex as \u2018no strings\u2019, which means I\u2019ve never had a one night stand.\n\nSometimes I\u2019ve wondered if I missed out on that sexy as hell, raunchy one-night stand you see in the movies. Is it ever as fun as that? I guess I\u2019ll never know \u2013 but personally, I\u2019ve found not having one-night stands very empowering.\n\nSometimes I\u2019ve wondered if I have missed out on that sexy as hell, raunchy one-night stand scene you see in the movies (Picture: Jessica Evans)\n\nThere\u2019s a misconception that Christianity is full of rules and holds you back from living the best life you can have but for me, my faith is full of freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are boundaries but these boundaries are rooted in love \u2013 just like you have certain boundaries in a relationship. You wouldn\u2019t cheat on your partner because you love them, for instance.\n\nDating as a Christian in a secular society definitely has its challenges but I wouldn\u2019t want to be in love any other way.\n\nI met my now boyfriend within the first couple weeks after I moved back to my hometown Liverpool, after years of living away in London. I\u2019d just got out of a relationship and wasn\u2019t interested in anything serious, so I wanted to keep things light and have fun dating people on Tinder.\n\nHowever, I knew shortly after meeting him it was going to be anything but light. We fell for each other pretty quickly.\n\nHe isn\u2019t Christian, and when I told him I was he told me he thought I had been indoctrinated! I laugh as I write that.\n\nWe have a mixed-faith relationship: my faith is extremely personal to me and we work together in peace and private.\n\nHe holds pretty liberal views and even though we occasionally have disagreements in what I call \u2018a clash of world views\u2019, on the whole, we\u2019re a good match and very much in love (which always helps).\n\nThe tough bit? When I see him stressed or hurting, it\u2019s hard not to reach out and pray for him. It feels like I\u2019m fighting my instincts. All I want to do is put God in the centre of our relationship, particularly in those moments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is very supportive and I still pray when I\u2019m around him. He understands what being a Christian means to me and in times where I\u2019m finding it difficult to make a decision, he will often say to me, \u2018Let your faith guide you\u2019.\n\nIt always helps and ultimately, that respect he has for my faith is one of the reasons why I love him. Although we don\u2019t always agree, there is a huge amount of respect between us for each other\u2019s values and beliefs.\n\nBeing in a mixed-faith relationship has taught me that although there\u2019s compromise along the way, with the right person, there\u2019s also a great deal of love, patience, kindness and learning.\n\nLike it says in 1 Corinthians 16:14, \u2018Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we try to do.\n\nLast week in Love, Or Something Like It: Abuse convinced me that true love was all about the other person\u2019s pleasure\n\nWrite for Love, Or Something Like It Love, Or Something Like It is a brand new series for Metro.co.uk, published every Saturday.
