He was 90.\n\n\u201cToday, the city of Detroit, The United States and the world lost a fearless civil rights leader and hero,\u201d his family said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMy husband was a fighter; when your back was up against a wall, he was right there with you. Not just for me, but for everyone,\u201d his wife Monica said.\n\nConyers was a political powerhouse from Detroit who co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus and employed civil rights icon Rosa Parks on his congressional staff, where she worked for 23 years.\n\nHe weathered multiple scandals during an illustrious 53-year career in Congress but suddenly resigned in late 2017 over a series of sexual harassment accusations by former staffers.\n\nConyers was abandoned by party leadership when the seriousness of the allegations against him \u2014 which he maintained were \u201cnot true\u201d \u2014 became apparent.
