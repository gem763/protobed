The French are risking censure for disagreeing with German-led austerity policies.\n\nBut Paris is standing firm, arguing that the current circumstances are exceptional.\n\nFinance Minister Michel Sapin said: \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the serious nature of the budget; we reject austerity; the deficit will return within [the] three percent [limit] in 2017.\u201d\n\nThe deficit is 4.4 percent this year. It\u2019s projected to still be 4.3 next year. But by 2017, Paris predicts 2.8 percent.\n\nFrance\u2019s public debt has surpassed the euro zone average, standing at 93.5 percent, compared to 78.4 percent for Germany.\n\nIn spite of the 50 billion euros of savings the government is promising to reduce the budget by from now till 2017, it acknowledged the total volume of public spending would still rise slightly. It\u2019s already ten points higher than Germany\u2019s.\n\nFrance\u2019s 45 percent tax burden \u2014 the GDP share \u2014 is still among the highest in the world. Only Denmark and Belgium\u2019s are higher.\n\nParis could be looking at a four billion euro fine for flouting the EU budget rules. It probably can\u2019t get out of it, since smaller countries have been forced to make sacrifices, unless it can prove its plans are credible.\n\nEconomist Marc Touati said it can\u2019t: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking real measures. We need shock therapy, and that has never been applied, either by Sarkozy or Hollande. We\u2019re going to keep racking up deficits and swelling debt.\u201d\n\nThe government argues that further austerity could snuff out a fragile euro zone recovery. Italy, Greece, Ireland and Spain\u2019s thinking tends that way too. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has climbed on board as well, to try to persuade Chancellor Angela Merkel, along with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. They want flexible budgetary discipline.\n\nHollande said: \u201cWe also have to adjust our budget policies in relation to growth stakes because if everyone applies austerity, which isn\u2019t the case for France, there\u2019ll be an even bigger slowdown in growth.\u201d\n\nThe Socialist leader\u2019s personal ratings are an abysmal 13 percent. Even allies in the French parliament say the 2015 budget is too austere with too many spending cuts, while European Union officials warn the plans don\u2019t go far enough.", "description": "France is likely to be penalised when its budget is scrutinised this Wednesday by the European Commission. \n\n\tParis has not been complying with the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2014-10-15"}
