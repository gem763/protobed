or could ever be intended to fly.\"\n\nThe plan falls short of upholding the commitment made by the UK government when it was led by Theresa May, to make sure there are no physical checks on the island of Ireland whatsoever as a result of Brexit.\n\nJonathan Powell, who represented the UK government in Northern Ireland peace talks, said the proposals were \"not serious\" and indicated that Johnson was actually trying to avoid an agreement with the EU so no deal takes place.\n\nAnd Helen McEntee, the Irish government's Minister for European Affairs, said the proposals were \"unacceptable\" as they breached the UK government's previous commitment to avoid physical checks on the island of Ireland.\n\nRead more: These business owners on the Irish border fear a no-deal Brexit could soon wreck their livelihoods\n\nRead more: 'The guns are back out again': Northern Ireland fears a Brexit border will escalate violence\n\nUnder law passed last month, Johnson must secure parliamentary approval for a Brexit with deal with EU by mid-October, or request a fresh delay to the UK's exit through an extension to Article 50.\n\nHowever, the prime minister has said he will not delay Brexit.\n\nOn Wednesday, he told Conservative party conference: \"We will work for a deal with our EU friends; but whatever happens we must come out by the end of October.\"", "description": "The prime minister submitted his Brexit proposals to the EU on Wednesday after delivering a speech to Conservative party conference.", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d948ce92d816302e06cdd2a?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
