So if Visa and Mastercard want to issue cards for Libra wallet at a later stage, they can still do it without being members of the association.\u201d\n\nThe Calibra executive further expressed his respect to the seven companies\u2019 decision to leave the project and thanked the firms for having the courage to \u201clook at potentially disrupting themselves.\u201d\n\nMarcus said that he understands that the firms have a responsibility to their shareholders, which \u201cwere under a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawal has nothing to do with regulatory concerns\n\nAccording to Marcus, the departure of the seven firms has nothing to do with regulatory matters as Libra project is \u201cfleshing out all of the regulatory requirements and oversight required for this to operate.\u201d\n\nHowever, the executive admitted that the process around Libra will continue to be difficult and will become even harder before it gets easier, while the association members should have the passion, energy and fortitude to press forward.\n\nThe news comes after Libra was formally founded in Geneva, Switzerland, on Oct. 14, with the 21 remaining initial members, including Uber, Lyft, Coinbase, Spotify and Vodafone.\n\nAs reported, Libra hopes to attract 100 members before its public launch slated for the first half of 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson said recently that Facebook adding Bitcoin (BTC) to Calibra would be a \u201cway better idea\u201d than creating a new currency.", "description": "Recent departures including Paypal and Visa does not mean Facebook\u2019s Libra currency project is over, reassured Calibra head, David Marcus", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZDg1Nzk4ZmVjNzUwNzc3MTcwZGYzZjQ2ZmJkNzFhZjIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
