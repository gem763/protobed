The compromise of choosing a bar and only drinking coffee means that she can offer Neil the option of drinking alcohol should he desire to do so.\n\nIntroductory conversations can be nervy affairs at the best of times, but questioning someone from a different culture to you with potential for a language barrier getting in the way makes Neil and Rahela's chat stilted at times.\n\nAs well as being a slight issue during a conversation, the problem of a language barrier is something Rahela points out to Neil is an issue in her daily life:\n\n\"You can\u2019t find a job because you don\u2019t know the language.\"\n\nNeil is obviously sympathetic to Rahela's situation, but quizzing her as to what Scots like him can do brings out a frank reply from the 21-year-old:\n\n\"Make [Roma people] feel more welcome... I teach Romanes at a swap market and privately as well. I think if the Scottish people do a bit of their part then the Roma people can do a bit of their part.\"\n\nNeil also points out that there will be many people in the local Govanhill community who will believe that if Roma people come to Scotland, then it\u2019s their responsibility to learn the language.\n\n\n\n'[Some Roma people] find it difficult to even learn the basics. They know nothing, zero.'\n\n\n\nGiven the massive issues surrounding learning the language, Neil asks why Roma people come to the UK if there is not any help for them to better integrate into a local community.\n\n\n\nRahela's resignation is evident in her reply:\n\n\"I don\u2019t know.\"", "description": "Rock and Roma explores how Scots and Glasgow's Roma community can better integrate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07n41h1.jpg"}
