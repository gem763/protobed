I\u2019d just had a baby. We had an enormous mortgage, I was the main earner but both myself and my husband are freelancers [her husband Steve Smith is a cameraman] and this job that I loved had gone.\n\n\u2018It was an awful time.\u2019\n\nNot only did the 59-year-old have to deal with sleepless nights with her newborn, Rosie, she had to deal with the huge pressure finding a new job to support her family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I remember going to meet people in TV, trying to get a job,\u2019 she continued. \u2018It was back in the days when there were no places for breastfeeding so I\u2019d be sitting in a loo feeding Rosie, looking exhausted, breasts leaking, still carrying my baby weight and feeling just awful.\u2019\n\nLorraine and her daughter Rosie Smith (Picture: REX)\n\nGMTV launched in 1993 and she was unfairly fired a year later (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\nHowever, Lorraine powered through like the strong woman she is and GMTV ended up asking for her back.\n\nThey asked her to return a month later only after winning a large sponsorship deal with a baby-food manufacturing company and needed a mother-and-baby slot.\n\nWe bet they regretted firing the new mum immediately.\n\nLorraine did find it strange seeing Anthea sitting in her seat on GMTV, but what could she have done?\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t her fault,\u2019 the presenter said. \u2018These decisions are made by the men upstairs.\n\n\u2018I remember walking in on my first day and seeing her. I gave her a hug and told her it was a great job and to enjoy it.\n\n\u2018Of course that felt weird, but I was never going to cry; I was never going to scream and rage. Career-wise I had nothing, so the most I could do was keep my dignity and do the best I could with my new little job.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
