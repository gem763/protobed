Marco Rubio: China wants to completely supplant the US \u2013 We can't allow it to hold the world hostage", "language": "en", "text": "Over the past several days, Americans have seen exactly how China uses access to its vast domestic market as leverage to coerce American companies thanks to a now-deleted tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver said last week that the league was \u201cnot apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,\u201d but the Chinese Communist Party demands total conformity with its worldview.\n\nCCTV, China\u2019s state television broadcaster, could not have been more explicit: \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nCHINA'S XI JINPING WARNS ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE COUNTRY WILL END IN 'CRUSHED BODIES AND SHATTERED BONES'\n\nAs shocking as CCTV\u2019s statement is to most Americans, NBA star LeBron James took a different approach on Monday, saying, \u201cWe do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negatives that come with that too.\u201d He assailed Morey\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet as \u201cmisinformed and not educated.\u201d\n\nNot all athletes agree, but far too many in business with China have made their loyalties crystal clear; and that is par for the course when it comes to dealing with Beijing\u2019s authoritarian regime. It also does not even begin to describe the scope of the threat posed by the Chinese government and Communist Party.\n\nBeijing lures multinational companies to China with the promise of market access in the short-run, but at the cost of long-term success. In March, CNBC reported that one in five North American corporations reported having intellectual property stolen by Chinese companies just in the last year. The extent of China\u2019s theft of American intellectual property is staggering, costing Americans up to $600 billion a year according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nLast month, I had the opportunity to visit a major American manufacturer that regularly forms joint ventures with Chinese firms. The company touted its strategic relationship with a Chinese aerospace company that did not have the technical capability to manufacture an essential component.\n\nWe must confront the economic threat posed by China and our own economic weakness.\n\nAt first glance, this is exactly the type of high value, advanced manufacturing that gives America a competitive advantage over our economic rivals. But the reality is different.\n\nThe reality is that the Chinese partner will watch, learn, and master the skills necessary to manufacture that essential component. After that, our American firm will no longer be needed and instead will face competition from its former partner -- competition that will be subsidized by the central government in Beijing.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical; instead, it is a well-developed playbook that has already allowed China to corner the market on everything from railcars to pharmaceuticals. And it is how China will attempt to dominate the industries of the future like robotics, AI, and advanced manufacturing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe cannot view these incidents in isolation. We must view Beijing\u2019s bullying on speech, expression and technology as a means to an end: China wants to completely supplant America and other advanced industrial democracies and become the world\u2019s dominant country, economically, militarily, and culturally.\n\nBy pursuing short-term Chinese economic integration, many American companies are now complicit in a system that violently suppresses political dissent and normalizes mass incarceration of ethnic and religious minorities, live organ harvesting, and mass surveillance. And they are laying the groundwork for their own demise and America\u2019s fall. They forfeit any claim they might have to a clean conscience for short-term gain. This must end.\n\nInaction is not an acceptable response. In response to last week\u2019s aggression, we should consider using existing laws and regulations, such as applying statues from the 1970s to counter unsanctioned foreign boycotts, to defend America\u2019s interests and hit back against China\u2019s hostile and coercive actions against U.S. citizens and companies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSimilarly, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) should revisit past examples of China leveraging market access into self-censorship, including in TikTok\u2019s 2014 acquisition of the American social media company Musical.ly.\n\nMore broadly, we must confront the economic threat posed by China and our own economic weakness. Unless we act -- policymakers, business leaders, and consumers alike -- we simply embolden the Chinese Communist Party to hold the world hostage when it doesn't get its way. And we condemn our nation to a future in which China sets the rules for our economy, our workers, and our culture.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.
