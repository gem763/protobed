Britain\u2019s pension \u201cfreedom\u201d reform mean that people can cash in pension pots.\n\nThe FCA has said that in most cases it was best not to transfer a defined benefit pension, but that financial advisers were still recommending transfers in most cases, Butler said. Advisers earn commission if a client shifts a pension into a new financial product.\n\nButler said the FCA was not being soft on the sector.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are remotely nice,\u201d she told a Financial Times conference.\n\n\u201cIf we have to go to every single advisory firm and, if we have to, we will close them down.\u201d\n\nButler signalled that a review of how funds must ensure they can meet redemptions was due next week.\n\nIt had been delayed to see if the suspension of a fund in June run by Neil Woodford, one of Britain\u2019s highest-profile asset managers, offered lessons.\n\nThe Woodford fund remains suspended after it could not meet redemption requests.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney has said that funds like Woodford that offer daily redemptions are \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d, but Butler said she disagreed with this view.\n\nThe BoE and FCA have begun a separate review of liquidity in funds.\n\n\u201cWe need to think quite carefully before we reach for lots of additional regulatory intervention,\u201d Butler said.\n\nFunds could \u201cstress test\u201d themselves better to see how they would respond to many redemptions, she said.\n\nThere is also scope for funds to think more carefully about whether an asset in their fund is really liquid, meaning it can be sold quickly to meet redemptions, she added.\n\nShe declined to comment directly on Woodford, but said that a rollout in December to asset managers of the FCA\u2019s system of direct accountability should make a difference.\n\nWoodford has not been accused of any wrongdoing and has apologised to his customers.\n\nThe Senior Managers Regime (SMR) has already been rolled out at banks and insurers, making it easier for the FCA to pinpoint blame when things go wrong at firms it regulates.\n\n\u201cSMR has the capacity to move the industry into a better place,\u201d she said.", "description": "Britain's markets watchdog threatened on Tuesday to close \"every single advisory firm\" that continues to wrongly tell people to cash in their defined benefit pensions.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
