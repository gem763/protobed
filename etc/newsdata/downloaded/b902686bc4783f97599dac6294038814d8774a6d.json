It has to fit perfectly and disappear underneath clothes while not cutting into your chest from any angle. It has to lift and support while making you feel sexy and natural. Plus, no two pairs of boobs are alike, which is why shopping for bras often just gets confusing and frustrating. To simplify the process, we\u2019ve collected opinions from experts as well as real girls who\u2019ve found bras they love. Below, 23 of the best bras for every type of boob and occasion, according to cool women and professional bra fitters.\n\nBest overall bras\n\nNatori Bliss Perfection Contour Underwire Bra $66 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nNatori came up a lot among the women we surveyed, who recommended the brand\u2019s bras as comfortable, stylish, and supportive options for a wide range of sizes. The Feathers Underwire Contour Bra is the best-selling bra for shoppers with A through G cups at Bra Tenders, according to Lori Kaplan, the founder of the New York City\u2013based store. \u201cIt\u2019s a very lightweight, seamless, deep-plunge bra with a little lace trim, so it\u2019s good for T-shirts, but it still has some feminine effects,\u201d she says. Natori recently broadened its selection of skin-tone shades, which Kaplan says her customers appreciate. Writer and personal stylist Molly Lamoureux calls this \u201cthe unicorn of undergarments\u201d because it\u2019s \u201ccomfortable, supportive, and look[s] amazing under clothes.\u201d If you want something simpler than the Feathers bra, fashion Instagrammer Emily Catellier likes Natori\u2019s very similar Bliss Perfection bra, which limits the lace trim to just the band. \u201cIt\u2019s impossibly comfortable, fits me like a glove, and hasn\u2019t started to break down after several years of wear,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also invisible under T-shirts. I hate when the top edges of the cups turn up and you see that line through your shirt, [but] this one is totally invisible.\u201d If you like your bras lacy, try Natori\u2019s Flora bra, which Mia Leimkuhler, a former Feathers devotee and manager of audience engagement here at the Strategist, wears under everything. \u201cIt\u2019s really similar to the Feathers, but it\u2019s lighter \u2014 the cup material is thinner,\u201d she says. \u201cI also think it\u2019s prettier, like the lace on the cups is a nice touch.\u201d Like the other Natori bras, it offers plenty of support.\n\nBest plus-size bras\n\nLane Bryant Cacique Cotton Unlined No-Wire Bra With Lace From $43 at Lane Bryant Buy\n\nLane Bryant Cacique Smooth Lightly Lined Balconette Bra From $37 at Lane Bryant Buy\n\nTwo stylish curvy women we spoke with, designer Jasmine Elder of JIBRI and content creator Thamarr Guerrier of Musings of a Curvy Lady, raved about the bras from Lane Bryant\u2019s intimates line, Cacique. \u201cI love the size range and colors they offer,\u201d says Guerrier. The brand carries cup sizes up to K and band sizes up to 50. Elder wears one of its wireless bras every day. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have underwire but supports as if it did,\u201d she says. Guerrier wears wireless Cacique bras around the house, but for everyday use she prefers Lane Bryant\u2019s underwire balconette bra. \u201cIt gives me the support and shape I want and looks great with most of my outfits,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a trustworthy style.\u201d Along with Elder, she likes that Cacique bras have wide straps and bands that look smooth under clothing and don\u2019t pinch into the skin.\n\nElomi Charley Underwire Convertible Plunge Bra For more plus-size choices, fashion blogger Kelly Augustine suggests Elomi bras, which go up to a K cup and 48 band size. \u201cBra straps must be wide, and they must be comfortable,\u201d she says. \u201cMy breasts are heavy, and my shoulders need all the support they can get.\u201d Elomi bras are one of the few that meet her criteria; she wears one nearly every day. \u201cI feel supported in the cups, the straps, and the sides, and their designs are lovely. I feel like it\u2019s a little sexy something just for me while I\u2019m running around all day,\u201d she says. $62 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest T-shirt bras\n\nCalvin Klein Women\u2019s Perfectly Fit Lightly Lined Memory Touch T-shirt Bra When you\u2019re wearing a thin or formfitting T-shirt, you\u2019ll want a bra without any seams or bumps that might show through your top. Lauren Stephens, the CEO and co-founder of fleece clothing line Dudley Stephens, who formerly worked in PR at Calvin Klein, told us she \u201cwas won over by [this bra] while working for the brand. It checks all the boxes and is my go-to for a smooth foundation.\u201d She\u2019s not alone: Lamoureux notes that the bra \u201chas a devoted following\u201d because of its light lining and just-right level of coverage. $46 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nThirdLove 24/7 Classic T-Shirt Bra Rebecca, a communications professor who blogs about her style at PhD in Clothes, says, \u201cI feel like my body is always on 360-degree display in class,\u201d so she needs a bra that feels weightless and disappears under her clothes. This one, from direct-to-consumer brand ThirdLove, fits the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s light, and it\u2019s not overly padded,\u201d she says. \u201cI have three friends who have this bra, and we all talk about how the strap has a texture on it so it makes it harder for the strap to slip. I didn\u2019t even know I needed that until it existed.\u201d Social-media influencer Tyla-Lauren Gilmore wears T-shirt bras every day \u2014 \u201cI can wear them with anything because they\u2019re supercomfortable,\u201d she says \u2014 and she keeps this ThirdLove bra in heavy rotation. $68 at ThirdLove Buy\n\nBest T-shirt bra for big boobs\n\nMontelle Pure Plus Full-Coverage T-Shirt Bra For women with larger breasts, Linda Becker, the owner of Linda\u2019s bra stores in New York and New Jersey, recommends this full-coverage bra that\u2019s also invisible under T-shirts. \u201cIt has some lace around the band, but the cup is very smooth,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople buy multiple styles when they buy them, and it comes in great colors, many colors. It\u2019s a terrific bra.\u201d It\u2019s available in sizes up to an H cup, and there\u2019s also a wireless version that Becker says gives a lot of support. From $52 at Walmart Buy\n\nBest lacy bras\n\nFortnight Ruby 3-Piece Demi The elegant, handcrafted bras from Toronto-based Fortnight are a favorite of two women we consulted. Fashion blogger Sara Brown finds that the brand\u2019s demi-cup bra provides enough coverage and \u201cthe straps are quite wide set, so no matter what I\u2019m wearing, you won\u2019t see my bra strap.\u201d Alyssa Lau, founder of the online boutique New Classics, typically wears wireless bras but turns to Fortnight when she wants something with a little more shape. She says the wiring in its bras is \u201cexceptionally comfortable and gives my boobs some nice support when it\u2019s needed.\u201d $138 at Fortnight Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the vendor B.tempt'd by Wacoal Women's Ciao Bella Balconette Bra $29 (was $38, now 24% off) One of the most affordable bras on our list, this style is a favorite of Lisa Mayock, co-founder of Monogram. \u201cWearing this is like winning the bra lottery,\u201d she says, adding that the perfectly fitting Ciao Bella bras are \u201ccomparable to others in my lingerie drawer that are more than double the price.\u201d $29 at Macy's Buy with code: THANKS\n\nBest lacy bra for big boobs\n\nFreya Women's Daisy Lace Underwire Balcony Bra With her narrow back and \u201clarge-ish\u201d breasts, designer and illustrator Karen Mabon says \u201cfinding the right bra is like hunting for truffles.\u201d Fortunately, beauty writer Sali Hughes introduced her to Freya\u2019s bras, which meet her requirements of being stylish yet supportive. Since these are available in sizes up to a J cup, they\u2019re a great option for larger-breasted women seeking an attractive lace bra. From $18 at Amazon Buy From $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest minimizer bra\n\nWacoal Visual Effects Minimizer Bra Not all women with large breasts like the minimizer look, but for those who want a smaller bustline in certain outfits, both Becker and Kaplan swear by this Wacoal style that goes up to an I cup. Becker, who\u2019s a G cup, wears it herself. \u201cMinimizers are known to be ugly, [but] this has a pretty all-over lace that\u2019s very smooth and gives a lot of support. It makes you look a size smaller,\u201d she says. Kaplan adds, \u201cIt does what it says it\u2019s going to do, and it\u2019s got nice wide sides [so] it contains any side pooching.\u201d $65 at Macy's Buy\n\nBest strapless bras\n\nMaidenform Comfort Devotion Custom Lift Strapless Bra $33 (was $44, now 25% off) As it\u2019s probably the most difficult style to shop for, it\u2019s not surprising that we had a few different selections for strapless bras. Depending on your size, the outfit you plan on wearing it under, and what level of support you prefer, you\u2019ll likely have to try on more than one strapless style before finding one that\u2019s comfortable, stays in place, and holds up your boobs. If you\u2019re on the smaller size, consider this minimal bra (available in cup sizes A through D) that Gilmore recommends. \u201cIt stays up, and it almost feels like I\u2019m not wearing a bra,\u201d she says. $33 at Macy's Buy with code: THANKS\n\nSoma Vanishing Strapless Bra With a wider band and fuller cups, this strapless bra accommodates up to a DDD cup size and would be a good step up from the Maidenform if you want more support. Stephens calls it \u201cthe first and only comfortable strapless I\u2019ve found.\u201d $62 at Soma Buy\n\nElse Lingerie Petunia Strapless Bra If you\u2019re like visual branding strategist Jen Wonders, who told us that \u201cstyle is the first attraction when I pick a bra,\u201d you\u2019ll probably gravitate toward this sexy design from Else Lingerie. It goes up only to a D cup, but, according to Wonders, \u201cit supports but still looks very feminine with just the right amount of lace.\u201d $95 at Net-a-Porter Buy\n\nBest strapless bras for big boobs\n\nWacoal Red Carpet Strapless Bra While it was hard to find a consensus on strapless bras for smaller boobs, for larger cup sizes the Wacoal Red Carpet bra was the clear winner. \u201cIt\u2019s been around for many years, and it\u2019s really fantastic,\u201d says Becker, who adds that it\u2019s often the only strapless bra that women with G and H cups feel comfortable wearing. Kaplan agrees that it features \u201cphenomenal support for a bra without straps.\u201d We\u2019ve even featured this bra once before, when writer Nora Whelan told us, \u201cUnlike the Victoria\u2019s Secret and Target-bought strapless bras of my early 20s, which lost their shape quickly, slid down constantly, and rubbed along the seams, I have never once had to readjust the Red Carpet Strapless Bra (or my chest) through workday wears or evenings out on the town.\u201d $68 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nSculptresse by Panache Dana Strapless Bra For women larger than an H cup, this style, recommended by Kaplan, goes up to J. As breasts this size can weigh up to 10 pounds each, Kaplan describes how difficult it is to make a supportive strapless bra \u2014 and how the Dana sets itself apart. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very well constructed, researched, and engineered,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working on that bra for over a decade to get it just right.\u201d She says her customers are very satisfied with the bra as it \u201cgives good separation, good lift, and a nice shape\u201d $78 at Macy's Buy\n\nBest sports bras\n\nNike Pro Classic Swoosh Sports Bra $23 (was $30, now 23% off) As part of our deep dive on sports bras, Jen Romanelli, the co-owner of Trooper Fitness, called this Nike number the \u201cblack dress of sports bras,\u201d so it\u2019s not shocking that it earned three mentions among the women we spoke to for this story. Augustine loves Nike bras, and Stephens likes that they come in \u201ccolors that show when layered under tanks [and] make workouts more fun.\u201d Elizabeth Corkum, running coach and owner of Coach Corky Runs, wears the bra too and says it stands up to her vigorous workout routine: \u201cI abuse my bras. I wear them every day. They\u2019re in the washer and dryer. This one holds up.\u201d $23 at Zappos Buy\n\nFabletics All Day Every Day Bra $17 (was $45, now 62% off) Both Gilmore and Guerrier are fans of Fabletics sports bras. \u201cThey have a great selection of high-, medium-, and low-impact bras,\u201d says Guerrier, who wears the brand\u2019s high-impact bras for weight lifting and HIIT circuits. If you don\u2019t need quite as much support, Gilmore loves the more basic All Day Every Day Bra. \u201cIt\u2019s supercomfortable, and I can do anything in it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my go-to workout bra for any type of workout.\u201d Note: Fabletics offers discounted prices to members of its subscription program. You can still shop without a subscription, but you\u2019ll pay the regular prices. From $17 at Fabletics Buy\n\nOld Navy Light-Support Seamless Racerback Sports Bra $12 (was $20, now 40% off) Catellier, whose workouts range from jogging to badminton, relies on affordable sports bras from Old Navy. \u201cI think they have some of the best bang for your buck in terms of basic support and long-term durability,\u201d she says. In our roundup of the best cheap workout gear, Old Navy bras were singled out by sports performance coach and professional golfer Andia Winslow, who told us, \u201cThey don\u2019t fade, and the structure and the elastic maintains itself over time.\u201d $12 at Old Navy Buy\n\nBest sports bras for big boobs\n\nFreya Women's Active Underwire Molded Sports Bra Supporting larger breasts during high-impact exercise is a tough job, and Kaplan says this bra is up to the task. \u201cIt\u2019s the most supportive bra I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt contains and encapsulates each breast and minimizes any kind of motion to pretty close to zero.\u201d She explains that encapsulation is important, as it keeps the breasts separate to avoid the \u201cuniboob\u201d look that often occurs when big breasts are squished into a sports bra. She has sold it to everyone from runners to horse-mounted police officers. From $29 at Amazon Buy From $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nShock Absorber Women's Active D+ Classic Support Sports Bra The Shock Absorber, Becker\u2019s pick for a sports bra with large cups, features strategically placed seams that help control motion but won\u2019t chafe the skin during high-impact exercise. She calls this bra, which is available in up to an H cup, \u201cunbelievable\u201d for its ability to comfortably lock breasts in place during high-intensity workouts, including running.
