(Photo: Osprey / Sanuk)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nREI is a wonderland for the outdoorsy. Filled with assorted camping supplies, inflatable mattresses, and clothing from brands like The North Face and Patagonia, it's easy to get lost in the store or while scrolling through the site. But the real trick is to shop at the REI Outlet, which has incredible discounts on the products you were eyeing from months earlier. Right now, the prices are even sweeter thanks to their Handpicked Deals sale.\n\nRight now, you can get up to 50% off select items from popular brands like The North Face, Sanuk, and Osprey. While the sale is limited to \"handpicked deals,\" there are plenty of good finds for both the outdoorsy and indoorsy folk. You can get an Osprey Pack for half off (it's just $49.73), which is a great size for hiking or carrying book bags, while a cozy pair of Sanuk shoes are just $31.73 and more than half off.\n\nFor those planning on doing some serious camping or hiking this season, there are great deals on essentials for adventuring in the great outdoors. You can get an insulated sleeping bag and a sleeping pad from Big Agnes for half off each. The best-selling Brooks Fiona Sports Bra, which is popular with runners, is only $24.73 right now, which is half off its usual price. Really, there's something on every adventurers list featured in this sale, so you might as well save on these big ticket items.\n\nThe sale only goes until Monday, November 4, and there's a limited selection of items featured this sale, so if you see something you like for a great price, I would hit \"add to cart\" sooner than later.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered. Follow Reviewed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest deals, reviews, and more.\n\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2019/10/28/rei-outlet-sale-save-big-north-face-sanuk-osprey-and-more/2487225001/", "description": "Get up to 50% off popular outdoors brands like The North Face, Sanuk, Osprey, and more at REI's Outlet Sale.", "authors": ["Courtney Campbell", "Published P.M.
