Wood after pleading guilty to a conspiracy charge. She also ordered him to forfeit $127,100, the amount of money he received in the scheme. The prison term is half as long as what prosecutors sought.\n\nThe judge said a prison sentence was necessary because it is \u201cwhat doctors in the future will take into account\u201d before deciding whether to join a similar conspiracy.\n\nSchlifstein was among five New York doctors charged last year with accepting bribes in the form of speaking fees to prescribe millions of dollars\u2019 worth of a fentanyl-based spray. Three others have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing while another is awaiting trial.\n\nProsecutors say the spray made by the Arizona company Insys Therapeutics Inc. is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. A message was left with Insys seeking comment.\n\nThe New York state Assembly in 2016 honored Schlifstein as a founding director of the New York State Pain Society.\n\nBefore the sentence was announced, Schlifstein choked up as he acknowledged \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be embarrassed for the rest of my life,\u201d he said, pausing briefly as emotions overtook him. \u201cIt\u2019s been devastating on my life in every way possible. Career\u2019s done. Financially destroyed.\u201d\n\nHe said he agreed to enter the company\u2019s \u201cSpeakers Bureau\u201d at about the same time as his judgment suffered when his brother died suddenly.\n\nProsecutors say the doctors, four men and a woman, collected tens of thousands of dollars from the company over a four-year stretch beginning in August 2012.\n\nProsecutors said the \u201cSpeakers Bureau\u201d was created purportedly to educate other practitioners about the fentanyl spray, but it was used instead to induce doctors to prescribe large volumes of the spray by paying them speaker program fees.\n\nThey said Schlifstein prescribed enough of the fentanyl-based drug, Subsys, to account for more than $2 million in net sales for Insys. The drug is intended to benefit cancer patients who become tolerant of opioids.\n\nThey said that although speakers were supposed to conduct slide presentations, the events often became mostly social affairs with no educational presentation about the spray.\n\nIn court papers, prosecutors said Schlifstein was seeking to become an Insys speaker in October 2013 when he met with one of the company\u2019s executives at a dinner that was supposed to be a fellow doctor\u2019s speaker program.\n\nProsecutors said the dinner, which didn\u2019t include any educational presentation, was followed by a trip by the group to a strip club Schlifstein frequented where everyone rang up a $4,100 bill at the pharmaceutical company\u2019s expense for drinks, a private room and lap dances.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A doctor once honored for his efforts in relieving patients' chronic pain was sentenced to two years in prison Monday for accepting kickbacks in the form of speaking fees from a pharmaceutical company to prescribe large amounts of a highly addictive painkiller.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Neumeister"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
