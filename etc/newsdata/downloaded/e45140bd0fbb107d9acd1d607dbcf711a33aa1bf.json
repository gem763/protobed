Originally the Libra Association had 27 potential members, but several companies dropped out in recent days, including Visa V, +0.17% , Mastercard MA, +0.17% and PayPal PYPL, +0.17% .\n\nMost of the remaining members of the Libra Association consist of venture capital firms and nonprofits. Some larger companies who are now members of the association include Uber UBER, +3.29% , Lyft LYFT, +0.80% , Spotify SPOT, -0.28% and European telecommunications company Vodafone VOD, -0.20% .\n\nFacebook FB, -0.49% has faced criticism since the summer when it unveiled plans to create a separate, private currency system to allow users to make cross-border payments more easily. Politicians have said they believe Facebook\u2019s struggles with protecting users\u2019 privacy would spill over into Libra, despite it being a separate organization.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company tried to answer those criticisms by creating Libra as a legally separate entity through the Libra Association, and by not owning Libra itself. But Facebook is still involved, even at an arm\u2019s length. The association elected David Marcus, a Facebook executive and co-creator of Libra, as one of the association\u2019s five directors.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of the House Financial Services Committee later this month to discuss Libra. That committee is chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who has been an ardent critic of Libra from its onset.\n\nThe other four directors elected to the association\u2019s board were Matthew Davie of Kiva Microfunds, Patrick Ellis with PayU, Katie Haun with Andreessen Horowitz, and Wences Casares of Xapo Holdings Ltd.", "description": "Facebook officially moved forward with its plans Monday to create a new digital currency called Libra, despite several high-profile defections from the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM661_libra0_ZG_20190702222012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
