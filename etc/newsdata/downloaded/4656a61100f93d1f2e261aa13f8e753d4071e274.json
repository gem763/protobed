It will be replaced by a \u201ctop-secret entertainment\u201d event in Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to a website for AlienStock, a celebration of extraterrestrial believers in Rachel (population: 54), the formerly-scheduled event from Sept. 20 to 22, was axed \u201cdue to the lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees...\u201d\n\nView photos AlienStock, a viral festival celebrating life on other planets, was canceled. (Photo: Getty Images) More\n\nOrganizers blamed alleged permit-holder Connie West, the owner of the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, a small motel booked to capacity for the weekend. \u201cThe permit holder (Connie West) was given multiple opportunities to provide us with the proof that things expected at this festival were in place,\u201d read the website. \u201cIn fact, she refused to provide to us, as agreed upon, contracts, proof of deposits or any paper proof of anything.\u201d\n\n\u201c....In short, the relationship has ended permanently, and AlienStock will be moving to a safe, clean secure area in Downtown Las Vegas as an alternative,\u201d read the announcement. \u201cWe are not interested in, nor will we tolerate any involvement in a FYREFEST 2.0. We foresee a possible humanitarian disaster in the works, and we can\u2019t participate in any capacity at this point.\u201d\n\nFyre Festival was a failed music festival co-founded by Fyre chief executive officer Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule in 2017, and promoted in part by Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid. The festival unraveled in Great Exuma, the Bahamas, over disorganized planning. Local workers weren\u2019t paid and McFarland was a defendant of multiple lawsuits alleging fraud, breach of contract, and negligence. He is serving six years of prison and owes restitution of $26 million.\n\nView photos Area 51 Celebration in downtown Las Vegas will replace AlienStock, a canceled event in Nevada.

The Sept. 19 event at the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center is co-sponsored by Bud Light and media company Collective Zoo. Admission is free and will feature live music from bands previously slated to perform at AlienStock.\n\nIn August, co-organizer Brock Daily told Yahoo Lifestyle of the festival, \u201cIf we do this right, in a few years, it could be an annual gathering like SXSW and generate a lot of money for Rachel.\u201d\n\nAlienStock came together from publicity over a Facebook event by a Nevada man named Matty Roberts. In June, he jokingly founded \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us\u201d as a plan to bombard the Nevada Test and Training Range, a highly-patrolled government site known as \u201cArea 51,\u201d which allegedly studies unidentified flying objects (UFOs).\n\nMillions RSVP\u2019d to AlienStock, prompting Lincoln County, Nevada, to request police backup for that weekend, especially since the event coincided with a similar festival called \u201cStorm Area 51 Basecamp\u201d in Hiko at the Alien Research Center. The latter event (Sept. 21 and 22) will screen a recent Netflix documentary called \u201cBob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers,\u201d about a physicist who alleges to have reverse-engineered spaceships at a secret government site.\n\nOrganizers for AlienStock could not be reached by Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nThe town of Rachel posted about the cancelation online, calling the event \u201cpoorly planned.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those involved will be exposed for their role in making this a complete failure and costing us, the Lincoln County tax payers, a lot of money in the process,\u201d the statement read.", "description": "The organizers behind \"Storm Area 51\" Facebook event canceled AlienStock for a \"top-secret\" event in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vrnd0xyQpMoHC7wc.Hmmjg--~B/aD01MjQzO3c9OTUzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a99abe00-d4c4-11e9-9ffb-eb5acbbbe3a0", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
