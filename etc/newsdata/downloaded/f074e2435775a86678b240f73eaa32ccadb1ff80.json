(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nTulane pulled out a last-second 38-31 win over Houston in unbelievable fashion.\n\nAfter Houston tied the score 31-31 with 21 seconds to play, the Green Wave looked like it was about to take a knee and go to overtime. Instead, head coach Willie Fritz pulled out a trick play to give his guys a shot at a victory in regulation.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJustin McMillan pretended like he was going to take a knee, but instead stealthily handed the ball off to Amare Jones. Jones, after a brief hesitation, took off for an 18-yard gain.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nNow with the ball near midfield, Tulane looked to the air to get the offense into field goal range. But it got much more than that.\n\nMcMillan threaded the needle to Oklahoma State transfer Jalen McCleskey, who broke through a swarm of Houston defenders and took off for a game-winning 53-yard touchdown.\n\nThis Tulane game-winner is \ud83d\ude31pic.twitter.com/Uo94Jhuq1a \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) September 20, 2019\n\nThe touchdown set off a wild celebration on the Tulane sideline and left the Houston side in complete disbelief.\n\nAnd that included head coach Dana Holgorsen:\n\nDana Holgorsen: \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable on every single level to let them go 70 yards in 14 seconds. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d \u2014 Joseph Duarte (@Joseph_Duarte) September 20, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nHolgorsen: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the stats. We\u2019re better than them in every statistical caregory, obviously, except the score. I\u2019ve never seen an ending like that in my life and I\u2019ve been coaching for 25 years.\u201d \u2014 Joseph Duarte (@Joseph_Duarte) September 20, 2019\n\nTulane overcame a 28-7 deficit\n\nThe win capped off a remarkable comeback for Tulane, who trailed 28-7 in the second quarter. But the Green Wave came all the way back, eventually taking a 31-28 lead on a field goal \u2014 one that went over the upright \u2014 with 6:10 to play.\n\nHouston, led by explosive quarterback D\u2019Eriq King, did now go down quietly, however. King led the UH offense deep into Tulane territory and the Cougars were helped out by a questionable late hit penalty assessed to Tulane.\n\nIt looked like that penalty may help Houston escape with a win. Instead, the Cougars, after a dropped pass in the end zone on third down, settled for a short field goal to tie the score with 21 seconds to play.\n\nThat field goal paved the way for the best finish of the young season so far \u2014 and the best comeback in Tulane history.\n\nThe Green Wave rushed for 325 yards in the win while McMillan completed only seven of his 20 pass attempts. But he made them count. Three of those completions went for touchdowns, including two long ones (38 and 53 yards) to McCleskey and a 48-yarder to Darnell Mooney early in the third.\n\nMcCleskey was one of the better receivers in the Big 12 during his time at Oklahoma State. He ended up being one of the first college football players to utilize the new redshirt rule and left OSU after four games in 2018. That allowed him to play his final season of college ball at Tulane, where his dad is an assistant coach.\n\nMcCleskey had only four catches for 20 yards entering Thursday night\u2019s game. He leaves it with eight catches for 140 yards and two scores, including one he will never forget.\n\nRidin' high into a long weekend AND a bye week with some more @CoachWEFritz #WinSurfing \ud83c\udf0a \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f#RollWave pic.twitter.com/uYhep4dy2x \u2014 Tulane University Football (@GreenWaveFB) September 20, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Tulane pulled out a last-second win over Houston in unbelievable fashion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UUObDumgZ3erBlitl.glvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EX.dhXeknsUttkMjOBqLVg--~B/aD0yMDYxO3c9MzA5MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7f372970-db57-11e9-a3d6-5d90895380a5", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
