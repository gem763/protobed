We conceded possession of the ball too cheaply.\n\nZdenek Ondrasek stunned England with a late goal in Prague (Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\u201cParticularly in the first half we didn\u2019t create enough chances. Second half we had some good chances that we didn\u2019t take and throughout the night we were too open out of possession.\n\n\u201cSome of that was because of giving the ball away. So we gave the Czechs, who played well, got to give them credit, we gave them too many opportunities to score.\u201d\n\nFew could have foreseen this outcome given the way England carved the Czechs open to win March\u2019s Group A opener 5-0.\n\nFabio Capello, pictured here in Ukraine in 2009, was manager when England last lost a qualifying match (Owen Humphreys/PA)\n\nBut, much like last month\u2019s 5-3 win against Kosovo, Southgate\u2019s side looked shaky at the back \u2013 and this time they lacked the attacking spark to get them through.\n\n\u201cI think whatever the balance, we didn\u2019t use the ball well enough,\u201d said the England boss, whose side face Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of a wake-up call, I think we\u2019ve had a lot of plaudits. I think we\u2019ve always maintained that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done to be a really top team.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think tonight was clear evidence of that. We have to respond in the right way. We have a couple of days to regroup, not long, and we have to reward our supporters with a better performance than we gave tonight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a night for positives, that\u2019s for sure. I think it\u2019s a night to accept the defeat, congratulate the Czechs and accept that we have to be better than we were.\u201d\n\nAsked how much blame he accepts having selected some out-of-form players in an ineffective 4-2-3-1 formation, Southgate said: \u201cYeah, look, I always have to accept responsibility.\n\nSouthgate and his assistant Steve Holland walk off the pitch dejected after the match (Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\u201cWe tried something to make ourselves a bit more solid without the ball, and that didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t look any more solid, and we were poor at using the ball in the first half.\n\n\u201cThat said, at 1-1, at half-time, we were able to change that. I think we were better in the second half and we created chances to win the game.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the players, I think there are players who aren\u2019t playing well for their clubs, but that\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in at the moment, certainly in a couple of positions. So, yeah, we collectively have to accept the result, but of course, as the manager, then I\u2019ve got to accept that as well, absolutely.\u201d\n\nA famous night in Prague for the Czech Republic \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddff\ud83d\udc4f#EURO2020 pic.twitter.com/VpupcJmTN0 \u2014 UEFA EURO 2020 (@UEFAEURO) October 11, 2019\n\nCzech counterpart Jaroslav Silhavy spoke in the pre-match press conference about targeting England\u2019s imperfections, yet could hardly believe how much joy they experienced on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously over the moon but I have to thank my players, first and foremost, because they played great,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was a 100 per cent performance and that is the only way to succeed really, so we are very happy and I think time will show that we made history tonight because we defeated England after so many years and at a time when they are playing really well.\n\n\u201cThe performance was really great, we were active and made England sweat even though they are a very strong team.\u201d", "description": "England fell to a 2-1 European Championship qualifying defeat when they could have sealed a place at the tournament.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/02/wire-19614440-1570843425-723_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
