I much prefer to focus on the struggle for our democracy than to focus on ALS.\u201d\n\nALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) has already robbed Barkan of his ability to walk, talk and even eat on his own. But the deadly disease has also transformed him into one of the most influential voices supporting \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d making him a kingmaker for Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nBarkan\u2019s story is so moving that Elizabeth Warren spoke about him and his family during the second Democratic debate.\n\n\u201cEvery month he has about $9,000 in medical bills [that] his insurance company won\u2019t cover\u2026 His wife Rachael is on the phone for hours and hours...begging the insurance company, \u2018Please cover what the doctor says he needs,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe basic profit model of an insurance company is: Take in as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage. That is not working for Americans across this country.\u201d\n\nBut Barkan\u2019s fame started out with a fluke. On his flight home after being arrested for protesting the 2017 GOP tax reform bill, he bumped into then Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and pleaded with him to vote against the bill, which was all caught on video.\n\nTeaser from 11 min convo: @JeffFlake on the plane talking about #GOPTaxScam cuts to Medicare that would prevent @AdyBarkan from getting the ventilator he will need to stay alive and see his son grow up.

He even toured the country pushing his progressive agenda.\n\nWith one social media post, Barkan raised nearly $4 million to oust Republican Senator Susan Collins.\n\n\u201cMedicare for All means that we get high quality comprehensive health care through Medicare, with no copays or deductibles or premiums,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats, tens of millions of people don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cMillions more have to fight with their insurance company every day when those companies try to deny coverage for necessary care. Ten years ago, Medicare for All was a fringe idea and now it enjoys the support of a majority of the American people.\u201d\n\nAt 35 years old, Barkan is now essentially paralyzed from the neck down and he uses his eyes to communicate, picking letters one by one. Because of this, \u201cNightline\u201d sent him questions in advance so he'd have time to respond.\n\n\u201cEverything about ALS is terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cMy body became weaker and weaker. I lost the ability to run and then to walk fast and then to walk at all. I typed with one hand and then I couldn't type at all. The worst symptom of all is losing the ability to speak. And together, all of that adds up to a radically limited ability to be the father I want to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred times every day, I despair at my inability to tickle and chase [my son] Carl, to help him build towers and train tracks, to read stories and tell jokes, to comfort him in the middle of the night and to scold him when he dumps his dinner plate for the fifth night in a row. That's the hardest part of ALS,\u201d he said.\n\nBarkan said he has also been forced to confront his own mortality.\n\n\u201cThat is why I am not shy about death,\u201d he said. \u201cI really just want my life and death to mean something.\u201d\n\nHis wife Rachael King fully embraces his life\u2019s mission despite knowing that it\u2019s taking a toll on his failing body and reducing the amount of time \u2014 his most precious commodity \u2014 that he has left with his family.\n\n\u201cWhen he got back from the tour last summer, his voice was noticeably worse,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was sort of this feeling of, like, \u2018Oh, we kind of lost that time when we could have been speaking more.\u2019 But, you know, I think overall, it's given him so much strength to try to find some sort of meaning in what, at first, just seemed like this random horrible thing that happened to us.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nIt was just three years ago when the college sweethearts welcomed their baby boy Carl. Both their careers were hitting their stride \u2014 after Yale Law School, Barkan was fighting for low-income workers\u2019 rights and King was teaching English at UC Santa Barbara.\n\n\u201cI really clearly remember one morning thinking to myself, \u2018How could life get any better than this?\u2019 I mean, we were just so happy,\u201d she said.\n\nThat all changed when \u201cAdy had been having some pain and weakness in his left hand and he thought it was carpal tunnel syndrome,\u201d King said. \u201cHe had been rocking Carl a lot in his left arm\u2026 So he thought that\u2019s what was contributing to his pain.\u201d\n\nThe doctor diagnosed him with motor neuron disease, which is \u201csort of the precursor to ALS,\u201d King explained.\n\n\u201cIt felt suddenly like we were wondering if Ady would see Carl go to kindergarten,\u201d she said. \u201cWill Carl ever remember Ady? And you're told, you know, it's a prognosis of three to four years.\u201d\n\nKing said that at first, \u201che couldn\u2019t see any meaning in it. It felt like everything had been taken away.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, the young couple soon discovered their insurance company was denying coverage for necessary medical care, such as the ventilator that helped him breathe.\n\n\u201cAll of the confusing paperwork we get from the health insurance company and having to parse that and figuring out what they\u2019re saying \u2014 spending time appealing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us, that\u2019s a little bit easier because Ady can put something on Twitter and put pressure on the health care company but other people aren\u2019t able to do that.\u201d\n\nKing said the family pays $9,000 a month out of pocket for home health care \u201cjust to help Ady be able to kind of be part of everyone\u2019s lives [and] to get up and get dressed.\u201d\n\nMuch of these medical costs are paid through GoFundMe donations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, as Ady has said, a substitute for a functional health care system,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t get care based on how sympathetic you are.\u201d\n\nBarkan admitted that early on he felt lost and overwhelmed by all of it.\n\n\u201cThree weeks after my diagnosis, we were dealt another huge blow when America elected a racist, sexist [person] to the presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cAs he and the Republicans did more and more to undermine our democracy and our social fabric, I decided I had to throw myself into the fight.\u201d\n\nHis first battle played out on social media with the viral video of Flake, dubbed \u201c#FlakesOnAPlane,\u201d which gave him a powerful platform. Liz Jaff, who recorded the interaction, had only met Ady moments before the in-flight moment.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw on the plane was a human interaction. I mean, everybody on the plane was crying at the end of it,\u201d Jaff said. \u201cWhen Ady lands from Santa Barbara, we [were] at over a million views on this video, which is\u2026I mean, insane.\u201d\n\nJaff, an Obama staffer-turned-political-consultant, became his impromptu new partner in crime.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cI basically stopped doing any other work I was doing and sat down with him and said, \u2018We have something here. You are a messenger. What do you want to do?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I think we should start a Super PAC. We should do it for the little people,\u2019\u201d Jaff said.\n\nThey named their super PAC \u201cBe a Hero,\u201d and though it, they raised more than a $1 million to support Democrats across the country who were running in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWe cut ads. They were run in 100 districts,\u201d Jaff said. \u201cWe won every single race [that] we ran our ads in. We flipped a bunch.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi even thanked Barkan for helping win back the house for Democrats, telling him that \u201cnobody\u2019s been a stronger messenger than you, our hero.\u201d\n\nJaff also responded to criticism that the team is exploiting Barkan\u2019s disease for political gain.\n\n\u201cIf the only way that we\u2019re going to force people to talk about these issues is with somebody [like] Ady, that he has to be this sick for people to pay attention, then we need to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo pretend it\u2019s not [shrewd calculation] is crazy,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is a political strategy, every step of the way.\u201d\n\nBarkan said definitively: \u201cThis is not exploitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would [do] anything to be anonymous again. I would give anything to just be a happy father and husband,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be able to tell our human stories if we want our democracy to be responsive to us as individual human beings.\u201d\n\nThose personal stories are front and center in his new show, \u201cUncovered: Health Care Conversations with Ady Barkan.\u201d\n\nOnly 2020 Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren support Medicare for All, yet all the major Democratic candidates except for former Vice President Biden have agreed to sit down with Ady.\n\nThese conversations help turn tedious policy debate into a shared human experience.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris is so strong. She broke down when she talked about her mother and the loss of her mother, and the entire team is breaking down,\u201d Jaff said. \u201cElizabeth Warren, [who] similarly doesn't get emotional all the time, also broke down. Cory Booker, Julian Castro, the candidate[s] suddenly realize that these are the people that they are protecting when they want to run for president. You want to remind them of that.\u201d\n\nBarkan said he was inspired to create the show after being \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the first presidential debates.\n\n\u201cHealth care is the number one issue on people's minds. And yet, the conversation that the country saw in those first couple of debates was little more than a bunch of shouted 30 second soundbites,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought people deserved better, so these conversations are a way to go beyond talking points and press candidates to get specific and personal about how they see the health care crisis in this country.\u201d\n\nBarkan\u2019s crusade has a sense of urgency; just two days after his interview with \u201cNightline,\u201d he was rushed to the emergency room and admitted into the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cI don't think everybody out there can be as strong as this,\u201d said Jaff. \u201cI see him suffer through \u2026these things, really pushing it, when he's desperate to speak more, when he's desperate to say more, like, that's what a hero does. They just put themselves on the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he can keep fighting for as long as he wants to,\u201d King added. \u201cYou know, I think ALS is a really hard disease to live with and he needs a lot of support and we need a lot of support. But with that kind of structure, you know, I think you can keep going and have a meaningful life.\u201d\n\nBarkan details that meaningful life in his new book, \u201cEyes to the Wind,\u201d which is part political manifesto and part personal memoir. For Barkan, his best chapter still lies ahead \u2014 him and King will soon be welcoming another baby into the family.\n\n\u201cI'm super jazzed. It's going to be great. Our lives are so crazy now with the toddler and with ALS. Another baby will be a piece of cake,\u201d Barkan laughed. \u201cHonestly, Rachael carries 95% of the childcare duties. So I am worried about how she will manage. But I will do what I can to organize support for her.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s daughter is due in November, but in his fragile state, election day in November 2020 is far from guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to think about Ady not being here\u2026 I can so vividly picture what our life would be like if Ady didn\u2019t have ALS,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I want to be remembered as someone who tried to live up to the privilege conferred on me by the circumstance of my birth as someone who fought to make the world a little more fair and just for all,\u201d Barkan said. \u201cAnd most of all, I just want Carl and his sister to be proud of me.\u201d", "description": "Barkan can no longer walk and talk as a result of the disease, but he has become one of the loudest voices for Medicare for All.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/ady-barkan-2-abc-er-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
