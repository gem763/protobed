'not many people' had checked how she was truly coping\n\nPenny Junor called The Firm a 'strange family' who 'do not praise one another'\n\nRoyal Family haven't 'support one another very well' according to biographer\n\nThe Royal Family according to a royal expert, as fallout continues over Harry and Meghan's explosive documentary.\n\nPenny Junor told People magazine that the royal family 'don't praise one another' and don't offer one another large amounts of support.\n\nHer comments come amid the fallout of Harry and Meghan's explosive documentary, in which the Duchess, 38, said that not many people had asked if she was okay, while her husband, 35, appeared to confirm a rift with his brother, Prince William, 37.\n\nThe royal commentator revealed: 'It is a strange family and not one that has supported one another very well.'\n\nRoyal biography Penny Junor told People magazine that the royals are a 'strange family' who 'don't support each other very well' amid fallout from Harry and Meghan's explosive documentary\n\nShe went on: 'They don\u2019t praise one another and never call each other up just to say, \u2018That was a great speech.\u2019\n\nHer comments come as fallout continues from Harry and Meghan's explosive documentary 'Harry and Meghan: An African Journey'.\n\nTheir interviews, which aired on Sunday night and have since been viewed tens of millions of times on Twitter alone, triggered huge public debate about their roles in the Royal Family.\n\nThe couple opened up about the struggling to cope with intense scrutiny and Harry admitted that he and his brother, who were once inseparable, now have their 'good days' and 'bad days'.\n\nPrince Harry commented on his relationship with Prince William in the documentary, saying they had 'good days' and 'bad days' and that they are now on 'different paths'\n\nIn her first on-screen interview since becoming a mother, Meghan appeared to be holding back tears as she talked about being 'vulnerable' during her pregnancy with baby Archie.\n\nShe revealed how her friends warned her not to marry Harry because the tabloid focus would 'destroy your life' and Harry said that he felt pressure to 'protect' his family from unwanted media intrusion.\n\nMeghan revealed that 'not many people have asked if I'm OK' and admitted that she was finding her new role as a public figure 'a struggle'.\n\nThe Daily Mirror's royal editor Russell Myers appeared on Lorraine earlier this week and explained that her comments insinuate that the likes of Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, and Prince William and Kate Middleton are unconcerned about the well-being of Meghan, despite them all being aware of the 'struggles she's going through'.\n\nThe royal biographer called the royal family 'strange' as she suggested they 'don't praise one another' (pictured, at Christmas in Sandringham)\n\nIn the explosive ITV documentary, Meghan revealed that 'not many people have asked if I'm ok', with some suggesting this insinuated senior royals were unconcerned with her wellbeing\n\nRoyal experts have also suggested the Queen and senior royals were 'very worried' about the direction 'divisive' Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are heading after they launched their extraordinary attack on the British media.\n\nRoyal commentator Phil Dampier, who wrote 'Royally Suited' about Harry and Meghan's romance, said senior royals 'from the Queen down' are concerned and branded their comments in their new ITV documentary 'very serious'.\n\nEarlier this week, an online story by CNN's royal correspondent Max Foster quoted a 'senior royal source', close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, hitting out at the reaction to comments Prince Harry made about his brother in the documentary.\n\nSome saw Meghan's comment as a swipe at the senior royals as it insinuated they were unconcerned with her welbeing (pictured, with Prince Charles and Camilla)\n\nThe source also suggested parts of the media were turning 'brotherly concern from Prince William for Prince Harry into hysteria'.\n\nA royal source said in response to the ITV interview that William felt 'concerned' for his younger brother, 'as anyone would watching the documentary'.\n\nRoyal insiders told the Daily Mail they believe the comments to CNN highlight the level of 'paranoia' among Harry and Meghan's aides, or Team Sussex as they tend to call themselves.\n\nMeanwhile Prince Harry did not deny a rift with Prince William and suggested the two men were on 'different paths' now\n\nRoyal experts have suggested that senior royals are 'very worried' about Harry and Meghan since the documentary aired on Sunday night\n\n'It's very much a mentality of \"us against the world\", which is a real shame,' said one insider.\n\n'The duke and duchess have much to offer and could be a formidable asset for the Royal Family. But they need to work as a team with the rest of the royal household and, rightly or wrongly, there is a lot of distrust right now.\n\n'There's also a startling lack of self-awareness about some of the problems they have experienced that have been of their own making, such as the row over their use of private jets. None of this is healthy \u2013 for anyone.'", "description": "Royal commentator Penny Junor told People that the royals 'don't praise each other',  as the fallout continues from Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle's, 38, explosive ITV documentary.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20127728-0-image-a-86_1571915308840.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
