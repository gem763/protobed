In February of last year, the company paid $200 million to take what was then a 3% stake in Grubhub to bolster its delivery business.\n\nGrubhub shares plunged 43% on Tuesday after the Chicago-based company on Monday issued a downbeat forecast for sales and profits, warning about competition among delivery services and slowing growth in the sector.\n\nYum on Wednesday reported global same-store sales, or sales from locations open for at least a year, rose 3% in the quarter.\n\nSame-store sales increased 3% in the KFC business and 4% at Taco Bell, Yum said. Pizza Hut's had flat same-store sales. System sales in the U.S. at Pizza Hut restaurants dropped 2% in the quarter.\n\n\"There is always unfinished business,\" Chief Executive Greg Creed told analysts. \"This unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S.\"\n\nYum, based in Louisville, Ky., reported quarterly net income fell to $255 million, or 81 cents a share, from $454 million, or $1.40 a share, in the same quarter last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased 2%, while costs covering franchise advertising and services jumped 13%.\n\nTotal revenue slipped 4% from the year earlier, to $1.34 billion, the company said, in line with expectations from analysts.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 09:43 ET (13:43 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
