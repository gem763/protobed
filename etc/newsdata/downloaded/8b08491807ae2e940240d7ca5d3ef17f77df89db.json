They mean business. They want to be able to make a deal.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been accustomed to Trump\u2019s often exaggerated interpretation of developments, making negotiations sound more hopeful than they actually were.\n\nThis time, he told reporters, he sensed the Chinese were eager to resume new talks that \u201cwere much more meaningful than at any time.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s advisers were a great deal more skeptical and, shall we say, restrained. \u201cThere were discussions that went back and forth, let\u2019s leave it at that,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters.\n\nTo be sure, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He told a forum of business people in Chongqing on Monday that \u201cChina is willing to resolve problems calmly through consultation and resolutely opposes the escalation of the trade war,\u201d according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.\n\n\u201cAny escalation will run against the interests of the people of China, the United States and the whole world,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Washington Post correctly observed Tuesday that \u201cthis barely perceptible warming has yet to translate into any tangible negotiating progress.\n\nAdministration officials continue to look in vain for signs that Beijing will agree to rewrite Chinese laws governing core issues in the trade dispute.\u201d\n\nMeantime, contrary to Trump\u2019s boasts that the U.S. economy is the strongest it\u2019s been in many years, there is growing evidence that it is slowing, along with much of the global economy. And that his trade tariff taxes are in large part responsible for that slowdown.\n\nThe gross domestic product, the largest measurement of the U.S. economy\u2019s growth rate, was expected to rise by a mere 1.8 percent in the second quarter.\n\nIt is becoming apparent that Trump\u2019s trade war tactics with China and other countries are not working.\n\nLast Friday, in response to Trump\u2019s trade war tariffs, Beijing slapped $75 billion in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. That resulted in Trump ordering U.S. companies to cease doing business with China, and calling President Xi Jinping an \u201cenemy.\u201d\n\nIf Trump truly thinks he can win friends and influence America\u2019s allies by attacking their economies, and gain a political victory in next year\u2019s election, he had better think again.\n\nWe are losing the support of our closest allies, hurting their economies and ours as well.\n\n\u201cBefore Trump arrived, there were already signs his views on trade have become increasingly unpopular among world leaders,\u201d the Post reported this week. Shortly before the G-7 summit began, European Council President Donald Tusk warned that Trump\u2019s trade wars could drive global economies into a recession.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s absolutely clear that if someone, for example\u2026 the United States and President Trump, uses tariffs and taxation as a political instrument, tool for some different political reasons, it means that this confrontation can be really risky for the whole world, including the E.U.,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cThis is why we need the G-7.\u201d\n\nTusk not only singled out Trump for threatening the world order, but said the European Union \u201cwould be prepared to respond \u201cin kind\u201d if Trump attempts to impose taxes on French wine.\n\nUnder previous administrations, the focus of the G-7 summit has always been about its economic cooperation and security in the face of external threats.\n\nBut under Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda and global economic turmoil from his tariff wars, that historic unity is threatened.\n\n\u201cThere has been a complete realization on the world stage that the U.S. is not playing its traditional role, and may never again play the role it\u2019s played for 75 years,\u201d Jon B. Alterman, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,\u201d told the Post.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s unclear what role the United States will play, and what the consequences of that might be,\u201d he said.", "description": "WASHINGTON - President Trump announced earlier this week that long .09/02/2019 3:17:55AM EST.", "authors": ["Donald Lambro", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/306/c934caf1-cad5-46eb-900e-6228d8a6ff2e.jpg"}
