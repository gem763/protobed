Earlier this week, AMC, the biggest movie-theater chain in the country, reminded customers that it while it does permit costumes, it will not allow theatergoers to obscure their faces.\n\n\"Guests are welcome to come dressed in costume, but we do not permit masks, face paint or any object that conceals the face,\u201d the Kansas-based chain said in a widely reported statement this week. \u201cAMC does not permit weapons or items that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the moviegoing experience.\u201d\n\nStarring Joaquin Phoenix, \u201cJoker\u201d has been both heralded and heavily criticized for its in-depth portrayal of a failing clown who unravels, becoming a mass murderer and a sort of dark folk hero. Some see it as a close examination of the forces that can push a person to commit such atrocities; others say it merely glorifies and lionizes the ubiquitous mass violence perpetrated by alienated white men.\n\nIn 2012, a gunman murdered 12 people and injured 70 more at a crowded screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d in Aurora, Colo., where many audience members were in costume. The Century 16 Theater where the attack occurred will not be screening \u201cJoker,\" and earlier this week, relatives of the massacre\u2019s victims raised concerns about the film in a letter to Warner Bros., the studio behind the film. The letter called on the studio to stop supporting political candidates who accept money from the National Rifle Association and to lobby for gun reform.\n\nIn response, the studio extended its sympathy to victims of gun violence and said it had recently joined the call for bipartisan gun-reform legislation, while asserting that \u201cJoker\u201d was in no way an \u201cendorsement of real-world violence of any kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues,\u201d the studio said in a statement. \u201cIt is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\"\n\nBut for those who would see the Joker as an inspiring figure, the film\u2019s intent is unlikely to matter. In an interview with the Telegraph, Phoenix walked out and spent nearly an hour consulting with a Warner Bros. press officer after being pressed about whether the film could inspire real-world acts of violence. When he returned, Phoenix said he\u2019d panicked because he hadn\u2019t considered the question before. During the rest of the interview, which has since gone viral, he never explicitly answered the question.\n\nThe FBI has told local law-enforcement agencies to watch out for troubling online posts related to the movie. And earlier this week, the military warned service members about the possibility of a mass shooting at \u201cJoker\u201d screenings after intelligence officials found troubling posts from \u201cincels\u201d or \u201cinvoluntary celibates,\u201d whose beliefs have come up in several mass killings.\n\nIn a memo Monday that circulated on social media, senior officials in the Army\u2019s criminal investigation division sounded the alarm about \u201cdisturbing and very specific chatter\u201d on the dark web \u201cregarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the Joker release.\" The original information came from the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nChristopher Grey, chief of public affairs for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, told the AP that officials are \u201cnot aware of any information indicating a specific, credible threat to a particular location or venue.\u201d", "description": "The film\u2019s portrayal of a mass killer has prompted fears it could inspire real-world violence.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Am", "Taylor Telford Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
