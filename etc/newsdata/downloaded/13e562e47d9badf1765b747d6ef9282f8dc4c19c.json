You have spent years abusing them. In one of your postings you stated that you had become consumed by your paedophilia.\n\n\"It is clear from your postings on hidden encrypted paedophile websites on the dark web, and from the manual you were in the process of drafting, that your life revolved around your obsession with your own sexual gratification by child sex abuse.\n\n\"It is also clear that, had you not been arrested, you planned to continue the same lifestyle using the expertise that you were keen to show off to and share with other abusers so as to continue your sexual exploitation of the children of such communities.\"\n\nA Prison Service spokesman told Mirror Online: \u201cHMP Full Sutton prisoner Richard Huckle died on 13 October.\n\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing.\u201d", "description": "Ex- teacher Richard Huckle, who abused up to 200 babies and children in Malaysia,was serving 22 life terms at HMP Full Sutton", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Emily Pennink", "Image", "Afp", "Central News", "Andy Stenning Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12397204.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_A-handout-picture-released-by-the-British1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
