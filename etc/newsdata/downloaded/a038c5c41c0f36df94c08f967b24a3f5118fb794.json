Losses were minor and breadth was slightly positive, as traders jostled for position in front of Wednesday's news.\n\nNot only is the Fed issuing its interest rate policy at 2 p.m. ET, but the big Kahuna, Apple (AAPL) reports after the bell. With the S&P 500 breaking to a new all-time high Monday, we can be certain that there will be some traders looking for a \"sell the news\" reaction.\n\nThere were some headlines about the U.S. House of Representatives voting on impeachment procedures that caused some slight movement, but this does not seem to be an issue that is causing much concern for equities.\n\nMany stocks could use a rest after a good two-week run, so there is a greater tendency to put a negative spin on news. The big issue Wednesday will be whether the Fed hints the possibility of another rate cut before the end of the year. There is no shortage of pundits pointing out the irony of the fact that the S&P 500 is at all-time highs, while the Fed thinks the economy is weak enough to justify rate cuts.\n\nThe one certainty about the Fed decision is that it will generate some movement. As I've written often, the market loves to love the Fed, and usually looks for a positive spin. That will be the big issue for traders to grapple with.\n\nThere wasn't much movement Tuesday, but that is actually healthy in this context. The market needs a pause day, if it is going to continue to work higher.\n\nHave a good evening. I'll see you Wednesday.\n\n(Apple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells these stocks?
