Many now offer almost the same levels of comfort, support and traction underfoot, yet give the top of your foot freedom and breathability.\n\nThey\u2019re also brilliant when transitioning in and out of water \u2013 drying within minutes \u2013 plus, they\u2019re much more lightweight too.\n\nConsider what surface you're likely to be using them on \u2013 many come equipped with large lugs (deep indentations in the sole for added traction) and a grippy Vibram sole to keep you firmly planted even on the most technical rocky terrain.\n\nSome will offer a more plush and comfortable ride, while others are a much more minimal design with firmer and sturdy soles that will encourage a forefoot walking style. As well as this, some offer great toe protection, which is ideal in rugged scenarios.\n\nWe have also chosen sandals in our roundup that are designed specifically for water; they drain very easily and are made from hydrophobic materials, so your feet will dry out in minutes.\n\nAny hiking sandal worth its salt will have at least two \u2013 quite often three \u2013 adjustable straps, which will keep the shoes firmly on your feet, thus avoiding blisters.\n\nAs you might have experienced at some point, sandals can get a bit smelly. But many are now treated with an odour repellent finish, are machine washer friendly, or have a super simple design which gives little chance for odour to latch onto.\n\nWe have tested a selection of hiking sandals in a number of different terrains, both in and out of water, to find you our favourites.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers , but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.

The flagship of their range is the 3D Pro sandal, it\u2019s the perfect balance of functionality, minimalism and comfort. Solidly built, they\u2019re equipped with super grippy and durable Vibram 16mm footbeds which are zero drop, meaning your heel is the same height as your frontfoot.\n\nWith no strap across the toe section, there\u2019s much less chance for rubbing than those with the toe strap. It is worth noting that underfoot, the sole has a much firmer feel than most others in this roundup, which offer a more spongy feel. With three adjustable areas, everyone will find the right level of comfort. If you\u2019re in and out of water too, your feet will dry within seconds \u2013 there\u2019s no messing around with superficial foam type comfort that holds odours and moisture. This is a super versatile and great adventure sandal.\n\nBuy now\n\nTeva hurricane XLT2 sandals: \u00a339.97, Blacks\n\nTeva has specialised in making sandals since 1984, and the hurricane sandal, with its super simple no-nonsense design, is instantly recognisable. Recently refreshed with updated features such as added heel strap padding and a chunkier sole, these sandals are brilliant, affordable and will happily put up with milder hikes as well as for recreational use.\n\nThe three adjustable Velcro straps secure the sandal very well and comfortably onto your foot. The sole provides a good amount of support and traction and is made out of ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), a manmade material otherwise known as foam rubber. This allows water to roll straight out of the shoe, so your feet will be dry again within minutes. They are nicely proportioned around the foot, so you should avoid scrapes or bumping your toes.\n\nBuy now\n\nEcco offroad sandals: \u00a390, Ecco\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for comfort and support underfoot, combined with an open upper; these are a great option. The sole under your heel feel feels exceptionally well padded and sturdy, plus there\u2019s good arch support too \u2013 these really are well suited to longer distance hikes. Probably not the best option if you\u2019re going to be paddling in and out of water as they take longer to dry out than others, and the front Velcro strap doesn\u2019t really adjust much. However, they\u2019re adjustable around the heel and are lightweight, making them ideal for hikers.\n\nBuy now\n\nMerrell choprock strap sandals: \u00a385, Merrell\n\nEquipped with 5mm lugs and Vibram soles, these won\u2019t leave you wanting for grip, support or comfort.
