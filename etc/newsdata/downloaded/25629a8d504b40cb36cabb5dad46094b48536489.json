This ensures that there are always on-ramps conducting appropriate checks on prospective investors and transferees, whether that be the issuer or a regulated actor such as a broker-dealer,\u201d Domingo explained.\n\nAccording to him, this protocol will prevent any trades that attempt to be made to an unknown wallet.\n\n\u201cIf the wallet is known, the trade will then only go through if it doesn't violate certain transfer restrictions. So, there's a two-step process to trading compliance in the digital securities market that the crypto market, for the most part, hasn't experienced yet,\u201d he concluded.\n\nHowever, while the security token industry might be ahead in implementing new rules and despite being hailed as the new ICO (initial token offering), STOs (security token offerings) have not managed to raise similar amounts as the ICO market, which is in a decline now.\n\nBetween January and May 2019, eight STOs raised USD 241 million with the biggest offering being BoltonCoin, which garnered over USD 68 million from investors, according to the 5th ICO/STO report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). In 2018, the STO market raised USD 444 million. In comparison, a total of USD 3.3 billion has been raised through various token offerings between January and May 2019. In that period, 250 token sales were held. In the same time period from 2018, there were 537 token offerings that raised USD 13.7 billion during the same period.\n\nPwC noted that extrapolations indicate the continued growth of the STO market saying: \u201cFrom Jan until May 2019, positive development of STOs continued and is expected to carry on throughout 2019 and 2020 \u2013 assuming regulation of STOs strengthens and larger, regulated exchanges support STOs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTOs are significantly more complex than ICOs given the regulatory restrictions around who can participate per each jurisdiction. ICOs, in contrast, do not control who can and cannot participate,\u201d Domingo added.\n\nIn either case, he hopes that we will continue to see the growth of STOs \u201cas a funding mechanism as the overall experience of investing in STOs becomes smoother and simpler and we see increased options for liquidity.\u201d\n\nSTOs afford their owners with a greater level of ownership in comparison to ICOs/IEOs (initial exchange offerings) and were borne out of the need to comply with increasing regulatory scrutiny across the world.", "description": "The digital securities industry is already ahead of the rest crypto industry in terms of KYC (know your customer) processes, so the impact of the so-called Travel Rule should be minimal, Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of security token platform Securitize, told Cryptonews.com.", "authors": ["Alex Lielacher"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/9837d36695.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
