It means Trudeau will be forced to depend on other parties to govern.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives, led by Andrew Scheer, appeared to be slightly ahead in the popular vote, but the party has not translated this success into parliamentary seats.\n\nThey are expected to take 121 seats, according to Elections Canada, up from the 95 they held before.\n\n\"Thank you, Canada, for putting your trust in our team and for having faith in us to move this country in the right direction,\" Trudeau said via Twitter late Monday.\n\n\"Regardless of how you cast your vote, our team will work hard for all Canadians.\"\n\nThe left-leaning New Democrats, led by Jagmeet Singh, appeared to be on course to take 24 seats in Parliament.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois, a separatist party based in the French-speaking province, was expected to take 32 seats, up from the 10 it won in 2015.\n\nVoter turnout was listed at roughly 66%.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term in office on Monday, after a bruising and scandal-hit campaign.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106195703-1571750200183gettyimages-1177523325.jpeg?v=1571750247", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
