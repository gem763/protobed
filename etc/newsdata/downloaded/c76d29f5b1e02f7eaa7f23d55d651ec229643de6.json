Their long-term history is part of what makes them good business partners, Bennett said.\n\n\"If you don't have a deep relationship before you get into business together, it's a yellow flag for me,\" he said.", "description": "Subscription meal-delivery service makes gluten-free food for people who suffer from a range of conditions", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/16/cdd02cec-b4c5-4ee2-bff2-39f51edefd8b/thumbnail/1200x630/60ee19046cfe587855ee363a1a4ae514/screen-shot-2019-10-16-at-11-33-25-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
