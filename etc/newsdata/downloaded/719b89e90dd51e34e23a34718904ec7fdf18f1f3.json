Her debut book Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language explores the acronyms, memes, punctuation, and emoji that make up our modern discourse.\n\nIn your book, you talk about a game you played in high school where you would answer \u201cNot much\u201d to the question \u201cHow are you?\u201d and \u201cGood, how\u2019re you?\u201d to \u201cWhat\u2019s up\u201d \u2013 you quickly realised no one noticed. Have you always been interested in our linguistic quirks, and how did that broaden to a love of internet language?\n\nYes! I first got interested in linguistics proper when I was about 12 \u2013 I picked up a book that happened to be about pop linguistics and thought it was the most amazing thing. I think, like many linguists, I have a difficult time turning the linguistics part of my brain off. If you get me at the pub, I may be trying to listen to what you\u2019re saying and then get distracted by your vowels. So to be interested in the way people talk on the internet is just a natural extension of being interested in how people talk around me on an everyday basis. I see things go by and wonder how I could understand them and what\u2019s going on.\n\nIt can come as a relief to realise that you don\u2019t have to be angry about language Gretchen McCulloch\n\nYou say the book is for people who understand internet language intuitively and also for people who want to figure out what on earth everyone is on about. Do you think older, or less online, people can get to grips with the new rules?\n\nI think there\u2019s a level to which it\u2019s intuitive, but there\u2019s also a level under conscious control. I\u2019ve had people say to me: \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to stop using a full stop at the end of text messages, because I\u2019ve now realised that people are interpreting it as being passive aggressive.\u201d There are certain, very explicit things everyone can be more aware of. One of the things I hope to do with Because Internet is foster this kind of dialogue between generations, because there doesn\u2019t have to be one right way of doing things. I\u2019m not saying that everyone has to talk like they\u2019re a younger person, it can be just as valuable for young people to say: \u201cOK, this older person is not actually trying to be passive aggressive when they send me this full stop.\u201d\n\nBut some older people do get angry when younger generations use slang or miss out punctuation. You say this behaviour is deliberate and imbued with meaning, not lazy or wrong. Do you think people are starting to accept this?\n\nI think it\u2019s easy to see people doing something different from you, and assume it must be haphazard, random, or they must not know \u201cthe right way\u201d to do it. In reality, people are acting for deliberate reasons, and I\u2019m figuring out what those reasons are. I think that it can come as a tremendous relief to realise that you don\u2019t have to be angry about language, you don\u2019t have to be annoyed about people doing something different from you.\n\nYou\u2019ve figured out a lot of why we do what we do \u2013 we use excessive lettersssss to heighten emotion, and use ~tildes~ to be sarcastic. But is there an element of internet language that stumps you?\n\nI\u2019ve been spending a fair bit of time recently with the comma ellipsis, which is three commas (,,,) instead of dot-dot-dot. I\u2019ve been looking at it for over a year and I\u2019m still figuring out what\u2019s going on there. There seems to be something but possibly several somethings.\n\nOne use is by older people who, in some cases where they would use the classic ellipsis, use commas instead. It\u2019s not quite clear if that\u2019s a typo in some cases, but it seems to be more systematic than that. Maybe they\u2019re preferring the comma because it\u2019s a little bit easier to see if you\u2019re on the older side, and your vision is not what it once was. Or maybe they just see the two as equivalent. It then seems to have jumped the shark into parody form. There\u2019s a Facebook group in which younger people pretend to be to be baby boomers, and one of the features people use there is this comma ellipsis. And then in some circles there also seems to be a use of comma ellipses that is very, very heavily ironic. But what exactly the nature is of that heavy irony is still something that I\u2019m working on figuring out.\n\nIt must be difficult to write about something that\u2019s changing all the time. In your book you reference HHOJ (ha ha only joking), an abbreviation from the 1990s I\u2019d never heard of. Why would that fall out of favour when \u201clol\u201d has stuck around?\n\nIt\u2019s funny, because in the 90s lists of acronyms would circulate, but I think only a few were ever really in common use. There\u2019s a real tendency in media reports to sensationalise internet languages, so we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really how anyone talked. There was a fad for acronyms in the 1800s as well. It seems like a very internet-y phenomenon: a couple hundred years ago, people used acronyms of deliberate misspellings of phrases. One example was KG, which stood for \u201cno good\u201d, but the \u201cno\u201d was spelt \u201cknow\u201d as a deliberate, stylised misspelling, just like we see online. But the only one from that time that actually stuck around was OK. OK was a deliberate misspelling of \u201call correct\u201d but spelled \u201coll korrect\u201d. And OK still kind of feels like an acronym, but people don\u2019t think of it as standing for anything in particular. When I look at \u201clol\u201d I see something similar \u2013 a whole trend of making a bunch of words into acronyms but only a few have really stuck.\n\nThere seems to be a historical precedent for a lot of our weird online behaviour. What one finding surprised you the most?\n\nOlder people sometimes use \u201c\u2026\u201d to separate thoughts online, which can baffle younger people [an example from the book: \u201ci just had to beat 2 danish guys at ping poong.....&..they were good....glad i havent lost my chops\u201d]. I was very excited to find the dot-dot-dot had an offline origin in letters and postcards. George Harrison sent a postcard to the other Beatles using dot-dot-dots, and it really does look like a text message from your parents or grandparents from a different era. It was really fascinating to me.\n\nDid you expect to find so many historical precedents?\n\nI hadn\u2019t planned to keep coming back to the theme of offline origins, but I did. I had a feeling that people tend to sort of exoticise the internet and think of it as a place where all of the old rules don\u2019t apply, but in many respects people are still people, and we still bring ourselves and our cultures with us when we go on the internet.\n\nA lot more things than we might give credit for do have offline origins, whether that\u2019s sending something in ALL CAPS, or sending little pictures alongside your messages, or making media references the same way people make meme references in conversation now. To realise that all of these have offline equivalents, it\u2019s kind of a relaxing way to think about it. Not everything has to be new.\n\nBecause Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language by Gretchen McCulloch is published by Penguin (\u00a312.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
