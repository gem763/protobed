Now, he's in danger of losing their support | Geoffrey Kabaservice Read more\n\nDiscussing whether to allow White House aides to testify before the Senate Watergate committee, Nixon said on tape in 1973: \u201cI want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the fifth amendment, cover-up or anything else, if it\u2019ll save it \u2013 save the plan.\u201d\n\nBut compared with Donald Trump, Nixon was a piker. In fact, a strong case can be made that the secret mission of the Trump presidency has been to restore Nixon\u2019s reputation.\n\nWhen the US supreme court in a unanimous 1974 decision directed the president to hand over the White House tapes, Nixon complied even though it sealed his fate. In a similar situation, Trump would be burning the tapes on the White House lawn while shouting: \u201cCome and get me, copper.\u201d\n\nTaking time from selling out the Kurds, Trump followed that strategy to the hilt as he turned Tuesday into Stonewall the Constitution Day.\n\nHis defiance began with a last-minute decision to block the testimony of Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key figure in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. Then Rudy Giuliani \u2013 the president\u2019s malaprop mouthpiece \u2013 gave a Bronx cheer (\u201cLet them hold me in contempt\u201d) to a congressional demand for documents. Finally, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent House Democrats a foam-at-the-mouth eight-page letter stonewalling cooperation with the impeachment inquiry because \u2026 well \u2026 Trump wants to.\n\nThe phrase \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d has been used loosely throughout the Trump presidency whenever a law professor appears on MSNBC. But this time, Trump\u2019s scorched-earth defiance of Congress as a coequal branch of government qualifies as a true time of testing for American democracy.\n\nThe practical problem facing the House Democrats is that turning to the federal courts to uphold subpoenas is a time-consuming process that makes Freudian analysis seem fleet-footed in comparison. The justice department offers no salvation since the attorney general, William Barr, has transformed it into another branch of Trump Worldwide Kleptocracy.\n\nHouse Democrats are tempted by the notion of simply powering through \u2013 and turning Trump\u2019s rejection of subpoenas into another article of impeachment. That was the essence of Article Three of the 1974 impeachment case against Nixon contending that the president \u201chas failed \u2026 to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas\u201d.\n\nSuch an approach has legal merit. And, it would mesh with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reported desire to hold an impeachment vote in the House by Thanksgiving. But the danger in such a rush to judgment is that it would deprive the House impeachment hearings of much of their inherent drama.\n\nIt is easy to forget that Nixon\u2019s downfall was a play with two distinct acts.\n\nThe first act was the 1973 Senate Watergate hearings that riveted the nation with witnesses such as John Dean talking about \u201ca cancer growing on the presidency\u201d. That was when Nixon\u2019s approval ratings collapsed from 68% in the Gallup poll in January 1973 to less than half that by August.\n\nThe curtain rose on the second act a year later as the House judiciary committee approved impeachment with seven Republicans supporting at least one of the articles. Nixon\u2019s determination to never give in crumpled with the release of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape in early August 1974 that prompted Republican leaders such as Barry Goldwater to ask him to resign.\n\nAwash in advice from constitutional scholars, House Democrats desperately need to hear from top theatrical directors\n\nIn contrast, House Democrats are rushing forward with impeachment without the equivalent of the Senate Watergate hearings. Neither the showboating House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, nor the uninspiring judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler, has displayed the skill to orchestrate a compelling public hearing.\n\nAwash in advice from constitutional scholars, House Democrats desperately need to hear from top theatrical directors. Because the only way that Trump\u2019s impeachment will be more than a Democrats-only quest is if the dramatic arc becomes as compelling as Watergate. And that means that the target audience now should be wavering Republican voters appalled by Trump\u2019s conduct and Republican legislators who are privately ashamed of their timidity.\n\nThe Democrats should not rush impeachment with artificial deadlines. Instead, the hope is that a few troubled Trump insiders will resign in protest in order to testify honestly before the House. The moral decision that John Dean made in 1973 is just as applicable in 2019.\n\nIn the end, it should be remembered that Stonewall Jackson was a general on the losing side of the civil war. And Nixon\u2019s stonewall saved neither the plan nor his presidency.
