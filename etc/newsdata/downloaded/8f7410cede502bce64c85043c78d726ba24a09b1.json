Forecasts call for Dorian to approach the South Florida coastline early Tuesday morning somewhere near here, but what happens after that is still uncertain. Should the storm make landfall in Florida, it could be catastrophic. Should it veer north and lumber along the coast, it might not make a U.S. landfall at all \u2014 but it could still bring extreme storm surge, massive rains and hurricane-force winds to much of the Eastern Seaboard throughout the week.\n\n[Capital Weather Gang: Historic Hurricane Dorian unleashing \u2018catastrophic\u2019 blow in northern Bahamas]\n\nDorian has been a bit mercurial, slipping east of Puerto Rico and sparing it yet another assault and skipping across the Virgin Islands without leaving much damage in its wake. Though at times predicted to make a direct hit on Florida\u2019s Space Coast \u2014 still a possibility \u2014 the storm appears potentially headed for a turn that would put Georgia and the Carolinas at risk.\n\nGovs. Henry McMaster of South Carolina and Brian Kemp of Georgia ordered mandatory evacuations of their states\u2019 coasts, to take effect Monday.\n\n1 of 49 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene as Hurricane Dorian hits the Bahamas and Floridians prepare for the storm View Photos Dorian closes in on the northern Bahamas, battering the islands with Category 5 winds, pounding waves and torrential rain.

She used to live on a sailboat and escaped two hurricanes before 2005, when she bought her house. \u201cI look at that map and . . . a teeny part of me is worried. But my new hurricane windows were just installed Friday afternoon.\u201d\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged residents not to be complacent because of the shifting storm track, as he and officials across several states issued pleas for people potentially in Dorian\u2019s way to relocate. There is still time, ahead of what has turned out to be a plodding threat.\n\n\u201cThis storm, at this magnitude, could really cause massive destruction, and do not put your life in jeopardy when you have a chance to get out,\u201d DeSantis said at a mid\u00adafternoon news conference. \u201cWe are in a situation where this thing is perilously close to the state.\u201d\n\nWhile the storm battered the Bahamas on Sunday, South Florida enjoyed a hot and sunny Labor Day weekend. But DeSantis warned that the storm\u2019s 185 mph winds exceed those of 1992\u2019s Hurricane Andrew, which demolished the Miami suburb of Homestead, and last year\u2019s Hurricane Michael, which wiped out the small panhandle town of Mexico Beach.\n\nIf the current winds continue, DeSantis said, Dorian would rival the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which destroyed the Florida Keys and is considered the strongest hurricane on record in the United States \u2014 Dorian tied its landfall wind-speed mark of 185 mph on Sunday in the Bahamas. The unnamed Labor Day storm killed about 500 people, including 259 World War I veterans who were mostly employed as construction workers building the Overseas Highway and living in tented government camps. It also destroyed Henry Flagler\u2019s railroad connecting Key West to the Florida mainland.\n\nEric Silagy, chief executive of Florida Power & Light, the largest public utility in the state, urged residents to \u201crespect Mother Nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is foolish to just rely on what is an estimate of a track that is offshore on a storm of this magnitude,\u201d he said. \u201cA few miles can make a big difference in wind speeds. . . . If this storm continues on a western track and makes landfall . . . there would be significant destruction. This would not be a restoration of power. We\u2019d have to rebuild part of our system. Concrete poles would be snapped in these kinds of winds. Homes would be destroyed.\u201d\n\n\n\nFemale inmates from Brevard County Jail load free sandbags into the trunk of a resident\u2019s car in Cocoa, Fla.

(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nFPL\u2019s chief meteorologist, Tim Dunn, said he estimates a 50 percent chance that the storm will make landfall in Florida, and if it does, it\u2019s likely to land along the Martin and St. Lucie County coast lines, known in Florida as the Treasure Coast.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings stretched along almost the entire east coast of Florida. The National Hurricane Center on Sunday evening issued a hurricane warning from Jupiter to the northern end of Brevard County, on the coast just east of Orlando and south of Daytona Beach.\n\nEvacuations of the barrier islands \u2014 including the posh Palm Beach, where President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort is located \u2014 were ordered Sunday, and county-based shelters began opening.\n\nIn Port Orange \u2014 just north of the current warnings and where a new hurricane watch is in effect \u2014 James and Sherita Davis weren\u2019t too spooked by Dorian as they fished off a dock. They live inland and brushed off family entreaties to come north to Virginia or New York to wait out hurricane season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to hit us,\u201d said James Davis, 34.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to miss us,\u201d said Sherita Davis, 48. \u201cBut we\u2019ll get all the outer bands. The usual Florida. The winds. The rain.\u201d\n\nExhausted by the changes in the slow-moving storm\u2019s expected path, as well as two consecutive years in which major hurricanes (Irma in 2017 and Michael last year) devastated different areas of the state, several residents pointed to 2016\u2019s Hurricane Matthew, for which they made extensive preparations only to see it stay off the shoreline, weakening as it moved north.\n\nBut Trump, after a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, asked everyone in Dorian\u2019s path to pay close attention to the dangerous storm and to heed all warnings and evacuation orders. He said the federal government\u2019s top priorities as Dorian approaches the United States are providing lifesaving and life-sustaining support to augment state and local efforts.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know what\u2019s coming at us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAll we know is it\u2019s possibly the biggest. . . . I am not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of the category five, I knew it existed. . . . That\u2019s the ultimate, and that\u2019s what we have, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nWith intense storms becoming more the norm \u2014 Florida has seen a Category 4 and a Category 5 storm make landfall in the past two years and is looking at a third \u2014 officials stopped short of linking them to climate change.\n\nActing FEMA Administrator Peter T. Gaynor would not directly answer a question from CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Sunday about whether he agrees with science suggesting that climate change is making hurricanes more intense and frequent.\n\n\u201cYou can look through the history of the past 25 years, and there\u2019s been more hurricanes, more intense, yes,\u201d Gaynor responded. \u201cI think we can look to that at another date. But I think the message for today is, with the new Cat 5, don\u2019t take your eye off this storm. Now is the time for preparing yourself and your family for anything that might happen.\u201d\n\nIt would be difficult to convince the seven cousins and siblings who jammed into Jupiter\u2019s Chowder Heads, a New England-style seafood bistro in an all-but-shuttered strip mall Saturday night, that they should leave. They teased and laughed between rounds of wine and beer.\n\n\u201cYou look at all the shutters up in our neighborhood \u2014 those are the newbies,\u201d said Ronald Harris, 76, a native Floridian. \u201cPeople like me, we waited until the last minute, and now I don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\n\nTwelve hours later, Harris changed his tune.\n\n\n\nAt Chowder Heads in Jupiter on Saturday, Ronald Harris, right, wasn\u2019t worried. He changed his mind Sunday. From left are Linda Gaudet-King and Meryl Harris. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI got up this morning and looked at the radar and briefings and said, \u2018Oh no!\u2019 \u201d the retired engineer said Sunday. \u201cI came to the rational conclusion that I don\u2019t want to lose all my junk. I\u2019ve been forced to clean up my yard, put the hurricane shutters up on my 14-foot front windows, and I have to take back the words I said yesterday because Mother Nature said, \u2018Ron, you pompous little so-and-so\u2019 . . . I\u2019m not fearless, but I\u2019m not stupid, either.\u201d\n\nIn the Daytona Beach area, relief that had set in among residents as they watched forecasts pushing the storm east gave way to pause as Dorian intensified to Category 5. As the hurricane wreaked havoc in the Bahamas, some local roads along the Florida coast flooded amid a brief morning rainfall \u2014 perhaps a taste of things to come.\n\nCity police went door to door in communities prone to flooding with advice on how to be prepared and a warning that law enforcement officials might not be able to help residents who try to flee after the storm strikes.\n\n\u201cLast year, we had several people trying to get out in the middle of the storm, and we weren\u2019t able to get here for hours,\u201d Sgt. Don Rininger told a woman in the second floor of an apartment building who planned to stay.\n\n\u201cOh wow, really?\u201d replied Margaret Kyle, 44. \u201cSo I expect it\u2019ll be about the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d the officer said, leaving her with a flier detailing the locations of emergency shelters and tips for what to bring.\n\nMost residents Rininger spoke to planned to stay with relatives or go further inland. A few insisted they would be fine.\n\nSitting on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle outside an Ace Hardware, Ralph DeJesus lamented how some of his neighbors along the Daytona beachfront insisted Dorian was \u201cgoing to be nothing.\u201d DeJesus, 60, is bracing to stay in his home with his three Great Danes and a tortoise, with a generator, a metal roof and storm windows.\n\n\u201cThey are not all just another one. I lived in Miami through Andrew, and the roof of my house came off while I was in it,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cThey are nothing to dismiss. . . . Even the smallest hurricane has a potential for danger.\u201d\n\nDeJesus said he and neighbors have been at work boarding up windows on their block.\n\n\u201cIf it hits, we are in trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we really don\u2019t know at this point.\u201d\n\n\n\nChowder Heads in Jupiter serves customers Saturday while partially boarded up.
