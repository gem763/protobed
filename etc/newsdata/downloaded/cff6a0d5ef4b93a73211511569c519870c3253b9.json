Surprised? You should not be. African American cowboys have largely been erased from the record by Hollywood narratives starring John Wayne and Robert Redford, but were estimated to amount to one in four in the wild west. Now artists and musicians seem determined to put a stop to the exclusion with figures including Beyonc\u00e9, her sister Solange Knowles and Cardi B adopting western style.\n\nOne reason is the increased awareness of the part African Americans played on the western ranges at the end of slavery, when many former slaves headed to Texas looking for work.\n\nThat history is now proving as rich for black America as it had been for the film director John Ford \u2013 and the stories they tell are not very different. In 1907, the African American cowboy Nat Love wrote of his life in Dodge City, Kansas, as \u201ca great many saloons, dance halls, and gambling houses, and very little of anything else\u201d. Love, who was born into slavery near Nashville, Tennessee, drank with Billy the Kid, participated in shootouts with Native Americans, rounded up cattle and amused himself with activities like \u201cdare-devil riding, shooting, roping and such sports\u201d.\n\nHowever, life for freed slaves was hardly an idyll where racism and oppression had suddenly ceased to exist; the word \u201ccowboy\u201d itself, some say, had roots in a slur on these black labourers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Black cowboys in the 1880s.

We\u2019re seeing a very strong move on the part of marginalised communities to say: \u2018We were here and we exist.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, it\u2019s hard to find a rhythm and blues star who did not at some point don a cowboy hat. Ray Charles recorded country tracks throughout his career, putting out the great Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music album in 1962, and often said he was drawn to the stories in the songs from Nashville\u2019s songwriters.\n\nFrom Charlie Rich to Otis Redding \u2013 once filmed on his Big \u201cO\u201d ranch in denim overalls \u2013 to Curtis Mayfield and the Gap Band (who put out the single Burn Rubber on Me with a video of the trio in denim and cowboy hats), the western style has always been in the fringes, so to speak.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Idris Elba filming Concrete Cowboys in Philadelphia Photograph: Hugh Dillon/WENN.com\n\nLest any of this rich history go to waste, Idris Elba is to star in Concrete Cowboys, a film about Philadelphia\u2019s black equestrian community, the Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club, which has provided safety and security for the neighbourhood for more than a century.\n\nThe film was inspired by Greg Neri\u2019s 2011 novel Ghetto Cowboy about a 15-year-old boy from Detroit who is abandoned by his mother and sent to live in Philadelphia with the father he has never met, who is a black urban cowboy. In an interview last year, the director Ricky Staub said he was surprised to see a cowboy ride past his office. \u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d he wondered. \u201cWhy are you riding a horse in the hood?\u201d\n\nIn the murder capital of Compton in Los Angeles, there is another effort to harness horses and the cowboy ethos as a counter to gangs and violence. The Compton Cowboy posse officially came together as a group in 2017, though the area of Richland Farms has been home to African American equestrians since the mid-20th century.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t pull us over or search us when we\u2019re on the horses,\u201d Compton Cowboy Anthony Harris, 30, told the New York Times last year. The horses, Harris explained, protected the 10 members of the posse from police harassment. \u201cThey would have thought we were gangbangers and had guns or dope on us if we weren\u2019t riding, but these horses protect us from all of that.\u201d\n\nElba and the Compton Cowboys, it turns out, will be in good company. Nashville\u2019s ability to turn out crossover stars such as Kacey Musgraves has helped re-establish an upbeat version of country in the pop mainstream, but it is the black cowboy who has been turning up all over town, as witnessed by Texas pop-culture commentator Bri Malandro.\n\nMalandro\u2019s Instagram account @theyeehawagenda serves as a celebration of black cowboy aesthetics in popular culture. It\u2019s a treasure trove where you\u2019ll find anyone and everyone, old and new, offering a nod to the western style, from Beyonc\u00e9 in her Destiny\u2019s Child days wearing a cowboy hat to her more recent Daddy Lessons, and her sister Solange who put western visuals to her album When I get Home.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York fashion label Telfar put the black cowboy aesthetic on the catwalk in its autumn/winter collection this year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lil Nas X channels Little Richard and Prince at the MTV VMAs, a catwalk cowgirl at this month\u2019s New York Fashion Week and Cardi B performs at RodeoHouston.

Earlier this month at the VMA music awards, 20-year-old Nas X walked the red carpet in a silver sequined suit, ruffled shirt and silver cowboy boots \u2013 \u201ca little yee-haw mixed with the rock-star flash of Little Richard and Prince,\u201d noted Billboard. Nas X may not be the first R&B star to put out a countrified hip-hop song \u2013 Nelly, UGK and Outkast have been there \u2013 but he has single-handedly codified what had been bubbling up as a style trend for a year or two.\n\nVogue decided that Nas X\u2019s look \u2013 from designer Christian Cowan \u2013 \u201cmay just be the most dazzling interpretation of the boundary-pushing\u201d trend.\n\nNow we know even the Lone Ranger is based on an African American cowboy, the black cowboy in pop culture, crossing and recrossing cultural lines, erasing them in the process, is in full swing.\n\nTo Brielmaier, the \u201cyeehaw agenda\u201d is about reasserting visibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very intentional on the part of Lil Nas X to place a black, gay cowboy in our visual purview. His playfulness is grounded in an important history that has gone underrepresented for a long time. I\u2019m here. This is my space.
