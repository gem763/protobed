But the species is protected by law and can only be dealt with by local authorities.\n\nThe Hills Shire magpie was shot by the council after more than 40 complaints, the council said. One resident suffered a heart attack following an attack, Australia's national broadcaster ABC reported.\n\nA council spokesperson told ABC this particular bird \"was very aggressive and uncharacteristically territorial\" and tried to attack people's faces - going so far as to deliberately try to swoop underneath cyclists' helmets.\n\nIt was nicknamed the \"Windsor Road Monster\" after carrying out such attacks over several years.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Australian magpie can be very territorial during its weeks-long breeding season\n\nMagpie Alert, a website that lets users log swooping attacks, had at least a dozen reported attacks on the stretch of road so far this year.\n\n\"Same Magpie - swooped three times and hit right side of head and scratched my face,\" one user wrote. \"He started by coming in at eyeball level - straight on,\" another reported. \"I have never known a more aggressive magpie.\"\n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to capture and relocate the rogue passerine, the council obtained permission from the National Parks and Wildlife Service for the bird to be shot by a professional.\n\nThe council said the shooting was a last resort - but many magpie enthusiasts and animal lovers were unhappy with the decision.\n\nWildlife magazine Australian Geographic quoted bird expert Darryl Jones as saying that magpies were \"quite possibly the easiest birds to catch\" and that he was \"not very impressed\" with the shooting of the troublesome bird.\n\nAn online Facebook group for fans of the Australian bird was flooded with those asking why cyclists could not avoid the area for six weeks, wear extra protection, or simply suffer the bird which was \"protecting its family\". Many said they would complain to the council.\n\nEmma Hurst, a local MP from the Animal Justice party, said \"This mother was simply protecting her young. Now her babies will likely starve to death or be hunted by other animals.\"\n\n\"What a sickening and brutal knee-jerk reaction from Council,\" she said.\n\nMagpies are widely loved in Australia, despite their propensity to attack people. In a radio programme on the species, British naturalist Sir David Attenborough described a \"less violent side to this avian hoodlum\".\n\n\"Australian magpies have melodious voices, which can range over four octaves in a chorus of squeaks, yodels, and whistles,\" he said.\n\nGroups of the birds are known to carol together, in a manner described by the New Zealand poet Denis Glover as \"quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle\".", "description": "A notorious magpie was shot dead after dozens of complaints.
