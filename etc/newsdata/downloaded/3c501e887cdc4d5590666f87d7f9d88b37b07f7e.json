It's a cruel world.\n\n3) Arjen Robben (Monchengladbach v Bayern, 2017)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWhen your reaction is so over-the-top that it leaves your teammates in fits of laughter, you know you may have gone a touch too far.\n\nWith Bayern 1-0 up away at Monchengladbach with five minutes to go, it seemed a fairly sensible decision to replace winger Arjen Robben with the more defensive minded Renato Sanches.\n\nThe Dutchman clearly didn't feel this way, however, and dismissively slapped manager Carlo Ancelotti's hand before slumping onto the bench in a real strop.\n\nHis teammates on the bench, including Xabi Alonso and Franck Ribery, were hardly sympathetic, and broke out in fits of laughter at Robben's petulant reaction. Always good to know your friends have got your back.\n\n4) Cristiano Ronaldo (Man Utd v Man City, 2009)\n\nIt takes a brave man to kick off with Sir Alex Ferguson, but a young Cristiano Ronaldo did just that when he was withdrawn from the Manchester derby during a 2-0 win in 2009.\n\nThe Portuguese superstar was replaced by Paul Scholes after 58 minutes and was so flabbergasted by the decision that he slapped a drink out of a United coach's hand and appeared to almost be crying on the bench.\n\nFerguson played down the reaction after the game, but whether he was so cool with the player behind closed doors is another story.\n\n5) The one that didn't happen: Kepa (Chelsea v Man City, 2019)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOk, it's debatable whether this one counts seeing as the substitution was never actually completed, but in terms of drama there is probably nothing that tops those five minutes of madness from last season's Carabao Cup final.\n\nWith Chelsea and City just a minute away from a penalty shootout, Blues boss Maurizio Sarri decided to make his final change and replace Kepa with spot-kick specialist Willy Caballero. There was just one problem: Kepa wasn't having any of it.\n\nAfter a bizarre shouting match between the Spanish goalkeeper and the Italian coach, Sarri admitted defeat by flinging down a bottle and storming off towards the tunnel, and for a split second it looked like he would disappear forever.\n\nIn the end, however, he thought better of it, but probably wishes he'd never turned around as he only saw his side lose on penalties.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end for Sarri at Chelsea, but for the neutral it was one of the most extraordinary scenes ever witnessed on a football pitch.", "description": "Granit Xhaka's meltdown against Crystal Palace was not the first time we have seen players lose their tempers", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741457.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS176006926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
