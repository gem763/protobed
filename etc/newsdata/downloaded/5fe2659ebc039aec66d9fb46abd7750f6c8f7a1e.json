There, he underwent a cardiac catheterization, a diagnostic procedure to test for some heart conditions.\n\nGeneral manager Mike Rizzo told reporters Tuesday that medical testing didn\u2019t reveal anything urgent or concerning about Martinez\u2019s health, but he will not make it to St. Louis for the remainder of the series. Though there is no timetable set for Martinez\u2019s return, he could rejoin the Nationals as soon as Friday when they travel to Miami for a three-game set against the Marlins.\n\nBench coach Chip Hale, the team\u2019s top assistant, assumed managerial duties with Martinez out. Hale is experienced, having served as Arizona\u2019s manager in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen in situations in the past where guys, players, coaches have passed out or something. There was nothing like that,\u201d Hale told reporters Monday. \u201c(Martinez) just said, \u2018I\u2019m not feeling great,\u2019 so let\u2019s go check you out \u2026 There wasn\u2019t anything that was that scary for anybody at that point. I think players started to notice, like, \u2018Where\u2019s Davey?\u2019 So there was a time when nobody knew what was going on.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nationals lost to the Cardinals Monday and entered Tuesday with their grasp on the National League wild-card race threatening to slip away. They led the Chicago Cubs by just half a game and the Milwaukee Brewers by one. The New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies were each five behind Washington before Tuesday\u2019s games.\n\nThings already looked hairy before Martinez\u2019s hospital trip. Can the Nationals right the ship without their manager?\n\nWhen the Nationals awoke the morning of Sept. 2, they were 19 games above .500 and had realistic hopes of chasing down the Atlanta Braves for the NL East crown. But they went 5-9 over the next 14, including 2-5 against the Braves, to drop to 82-67 as the bullpen continued to give up runs late in close games.\n\nThere were calls for Martinez to be fired when the Nationals got out to a 19-31 start to the season, Martinez\u2019s second as manager. But then Washington turned its season around with a red-hot summer, as Juan Soto blossomed into a star and All-Star third baseman Anthony Rendon built his case for league MVP.\n\nIt will all mean nothing if a September collapse washes that progress away and causes the Nationals to miss the postseason for the second year in a row. With so much on the line, players are hoping their manager gets well soon.\n\n\u201cHopefully he is doing great,\u201d first baseman Howie Kendrick said when he first learned of Martinez\u2019s hospital trip. \u201cI love Davey.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
