The two have returned safely back inside the ISS since making history today\n\nAstronauts Christina Koch (right) and Jessica Meir (left) making their reentry to the ISS after completing the first-ever all-women space walk\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch (L) and Jessica Meir. Koch and Meir ventured outside the International Space Station today to replace a power controller unit that failed over the weekend\n\nThe first American female spacewalker, who carried out her own mission 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, said she was delighted by today's milestone.\n\nAnd a NASA spokesperson said: 'Our achievements provide inspiration to students around the world, proving that hard work can lead you to great heights, and all students should be able to see themselves in those achievements.'\n\nIn a more than seven-hour mission outside of the International Space Station, the women successfully completed their goal of fixing a broken power controller that supplemented its solar network\n\nKoch and Meir replaced battery units called BCDUs after they failed to provide increased power to the ISS.\n\nThe failure had not significantly impacted the crew or its mission but needed toto be repaired nonetheless.\n\nAccording to NASA, BCDUs regulate the charge for batteries that draw energy from the station's solar collectors to provide power as the station orbits at night.\n\nKoch, who is also set to complete the longest single spaceflight by a woman as she remains in orbit until February 2020, said gender milestones like the spacewalk are especially significant.\n\nKoch can be seen during today's space walk with a red band around her space suit leg\n\nJessica Meir's helmet cam as she moved along the ISS to the work station\n\nNASA, astronauts Christina Koch, right, and, Jessica Meir pose for a photo on the International Space Station. NASA has moved up the first all-female spacewalk to Thursday because of a power system failure at the International Space Station. (NASA via AP)\n\nNASA makes history as two women astronauts embark on the first ever all-female spacewalk from the ISS\n\nThe pair exited the International Space Station at 07:38am ET (12:38pm BST)\n\n'There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories from people who look like them, and I think that it\u00b4s an important aspect of the story to tell,' she told a NASA briefing in Houston this month.\n\n'What we\u00b4re doing now shows all the work in the decades prior from all the women that worked to get us where we are today,' Meir added.\n\nKoch, who has completed four spacewalks prior, has become the 14th woman ever to walk in space while today marked Meir's first spacewalk. The ISS has seen more than 200 spacewalks since 1998.\n\nWatchers took to Twitter to share their delight at the first all-female space walk in history taking place\n\nOthers jokingly asked whether the women would be paid the same for the walk\n\nChristina H. Koch, left, and Meir greet each other after Meir's arrival on the International Space Station\n\nThe planned all-woman spacewalk in March was called off because astronaut Ann McClain needed a medium spacesuit but only a large was available.\n\nDue to safety issues with the fit she did not participate and man took her place, making today the revised date for the landmark mission.\n\n'We must never accept a risk that can instead be mitigated,' she said on Twitter after the event. 'Safety of the crew and execution of the mission come first.'\n\nAt the time the cancellation drew widespread criticism, including from former U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton and global activism group March for Science.\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch (L) and Jessica Meir (R) in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, September 2019\n\nWoman completing spacewalks date back to July, 1984 when Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya became the first to do so.\n\nRussian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov \u2013 who died just last week \u2013 conducted history's first spacewalk in 1965, four years before the US put men on the moon for the first time.\n\nWhile today's event is a long time coming, NASA said it was not planned.\n\n'It is something that was bound to happen eventually, and the increase in female astronauts in space for the past year is providing another window of opportunity,' a spokeswoman said.\n\n'Fifty percent of the 2013 astronaut candidate class are women,' she noted, 'and of the 11 members of 2017 astronaut candidate class still in training, five are women.'\n\nThis photo provided by NASA shows astronauts Andrew Morgan with Christina Koch and Jessica Meir at the International Space Station on Friday, Oct. 18, 2019", "description": "The pair stepped outside the International Space Station at 07.38am ET (12.38pm BST) today and successfully repaired a faulty battery unit during a more than seven-hour spacewalk.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard", "Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/13/19882510-0-image-a-28_1571400522132.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
