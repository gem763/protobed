Enrique Ascuii\n\nNearly half of New Aim\u2019s 2018-19 revenue of $180 million was sourced from its eBay department store, where it trades as OzPlaza and sells everything from mattresses and flatpack furniture to chainsaws and toys, Last year it became one of only 83 eBay sellers globally to have received more than 1 million pieces of customer feedback on the platform, 99.4 per cent of them positive.\n\nA further significant piece of New Aim\u2019s revenue was sourced via Catch Of The Day\u2019s marketplace, where its store is known as Dailyplay.\n\nBigger than Catch\n\nYet the background seller is actually bigger than Catch. The Leibovich brothers\u2019 e-commerce group recorded earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $17.4 million in the final year before its imminent sale to Wesfarmers, while New Aim\u2019s EBITDA was $20 million.\n\nCatch\u2019s price tag of $230 million implied a historic EBITDA multiple of approximately 13 times, which if applied to New Aim would value it at about $260 million.\n\nHowever a higher multiple could be justifiable to value New Aim\u2019s founders when the Young Rich List is published in The Australian Financial Review Magazine on October 25. Listed local comparables JB Hi-Fi and Kogan are currently trading around price/earnings ratios of 14 times and 32 times respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe founders said they had achieved compound annual revenue growth of 44 per cent over the past four years.\n\nNew Aim has always been profitable, which Mr Lam attributed in part to a trusted, long-term relationship with a third-party agent in China.\n\n\u201cWe have 350 different manufacturers supplying us so it would be difficult to control that ourselves,\u201d Mr Lam said.\n\nThe agent identifies trending products, validates demand for them using eBay\u2019s subscription data platform Terapeak, then inspects samples of them as New Aim\u2019s finance team performs a credit check on the manufacturer.\n\nIf successful, New Aim then orders three months\u2019 worth of projected sales, as an expression of loyalty that Mr Liu said usually later resulted in the supplier offering him the best prices.\n\nDiverse approach\n\nThe diversity that New Aim pursues among its suppliers and retail sales channels extends to its delivery partners, with the founders saying they work with \u201call of them\u201d from Australia Post down. An internal algorithm determines which courier is best for each delivery.\n\nFrom renting 11,000 square metres in a single warehouse in 2013, New Aim today rents 55,000 square metres across five warehouses in Melbourne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of its 70 staff today either work there or in its customer service centre.\n\nHowever, Mr Liu said new hires were being made to support a renewed effort to market the brands New Aim has created for some of its product categories, such as Giselle Bedding and Artiss Furnishings.\n\n\u201cWe need to do more to differentiate from our competitors, because there are more of them all the time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAustralia is still at high single digits for e-commerce\u2019s share of total retail, where markets like the US have settled at 15 per cent, so there\u2019s plenty of years of strong growth opportunity to come.\u201d\n\nMr Lam, a bachelor of information technology from Monash University, and Mr Liu, a bachelor of commerce from Melbourne University, met at a mutual friend\u2019s barbecue shortly after graduating and began buying selected items in bulk from two-dollar shops and reselling them on eBay.\n\n\u201cYou have to start somewhere,\u201d Mr Lam said.", "description": "Werner Liu and Fung Lam started out scouring shelves for stuff to re-sell on eBay, now they are headed for the Young Rich List.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.284%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1dd40e76669487351711e9113981432bbf9d9a95", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
