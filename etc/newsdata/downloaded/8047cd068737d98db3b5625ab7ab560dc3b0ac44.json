By the time he died on Monday on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, where he kept a summer home, photographer and filmmaker Robert Frank had long embodied a paradox: He was a very well-off artist who did not care about money. He had awesome shoes and no socks and he wore the same pants for days on end.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m famous,\u201d he joked to a friend a long time ago. \u201cNow what?\u201d A big part of his life was working on the answer, and living it out made him a symbol to younger artists struggling to find their way. It may be that, as your doctor says, it isn\u2019t healthy to live your life angry. But Frank lived to be 94, bum heart and all. He raged, and he was sentimental, too, and the older he got the more the two blended together. So be mad, and risk appearing corny, and don\u2019t wear socks. Definitely don\u2019t be bored.\n\nFrom Smith\u2019s American Witness: The Art and Life of Robert Frank (Da Capo Press, 2017):\n\nRobert Frank\u2019s favorite image from his most famous work, the photo book The Americans, is a photograph titled San Francisco from 1956. It\u2019s like a punch in the nose. He was shooting in a park above San Francisco and was sneaking up on an African-American couple enjoying the view, and their privacy, when a stranger approaches from behind.\n\nThe thing is that Frank wasn\u2019t surprised they turned around; you can pretty much assume he was hoping \u2014 even counting \u2014 on them turning around. Confrontations got his juices flowing. So maybe he made some noise, maybe not, but when they turned around, the African-American man crouched down in a protective stance, eyes flashing hostility, the woman\u2019s face warily asking What are you doing?, Frank was prepared to pounce. This white guy has entered their space and is taking something they were not offering. A moment of submerged feeling dragged into the daylight.\n\nAs the contact sheet shows, Frank very quickly made a gesture of photographing whatever was next to them, pretending he wasn\u2019t really taking their picture. Then he walked away, and nobody got punched.\n\nFrank\u2019s San Francisco, from 1956.

He liked it because it is honest, and it is honest because it reveals human feeling, and anger was a feeling that explained the country in which he was traveling in 1956 about as well as any single emotion could. On both sides, quiet reflection had become impossible.\n\nLike that couple on the overlook, Robert Frank has pretty much always wished to go unobserved. There is little he appreciates less than people taking his picture, putting a microphone in his face, asking him questions. When approached, he has responded in a manner similar to the couple in his San Francisco photograph \u2014 or worse.\n\nFrank\u2019s Parade, Hoboken, New Jersey, from 1955\u20131956.

A documentary of Frank\u2019s life had just premiered at the New York Film Festival in Lincoln Center, and the subject was making a rare public appearance. At the end of the movie Frank stood and waved to the sold-out room, and everybody else stood too, clapping for the man whose work they loved and whose life they knew more about than they had 90 minutes before. The documentary\u2019s maker answered a few questions, then everyone headed out.\n\nI was sitting in a back row, the farthest corner from Frank and his wife, June Leaf. I had been working on this book for several years, and he had not responded to various appeals to meet. Neither letters nor the interventions of friends over the previous years had stirred his interest \u2014 or disinterest. What he extended was a shrug, a neutral acknowledgment that declared any exchange was beyond reach. I came to New York in hopes of at least looking him in the eye and telling him what I was about.\n\nThe room lights went on, and I had to move quickly because he was heading toward a side door that had just opened at the far corner. I raced toward him. A man was coming up the stairs, leaning on a cane, and suddenly I could see tomorrow\u2019s headlines about the legendary filmmaker Jonas Mekas being trampled at Lincoln Center. I stopped running and walked down to where Frank was a moment before \u2014 just in time to see him, Leaf, and several others enter an elevator and disappear behind the closing door.\n\nBy the time I made it upstairs they were gone.\n\nSome people\u2019s art initiates a conversation with other art; Robert Frank\u2019s work has been engaged in a dialogue with his first important subject \u2014 America \u2014 for over 50 years. It eventually became the most influential American photo book and a signal American art work of the last hundred years. The Americans has inspired plenty of people beyond the art world as well, far more than museum art usually does. Plenty of artists have described how his work impacted their own, but maybe more telling is that Frank\u2019s work has been so inspiring as to lead some \u2014 including Chris Marker and Ed Ruscha \u2014 to abandon a career in photography. Others return to The Americans again and again. \u201cI was 24 when I first saw the book,\u201d Bruce Springsteen told an interviewer in 1995. \u201cI think a friend had given me a copy \u2014 and the tone of the pictures, how he gave us a look at different kinds of people, got to me in some way. I\u2019ve always wished I could write songs the way he takes pictures. I think I\u2019ve got half a dozen copies of that book stashed around the house.\u201d\n\nFrank\u2019s Trolley \u2014 New Orleans, from 1955.

Pull My Daisy was a key film that helped launch a new American independent cinema, and by the time it had, Frank had turned to other styles of filmmaking. He was on his way to becoming, in the words of New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, \u201cOne of the most important and influential American independent filmmakers of the last half-century.\u201d\n\nHe has influenced MTV videos and generations of photographers who weren\u2019t even born when The Americans was published. And he has, more distantly, helped launch generations of Americans who have set out from home to see their country for themselves. There\u2019s not another living American artist who has inspired so many different kinds of people \u2014 writers, political activists, musicians, sleepers on the beach \u2014 to do what they believe in. His example shows where following your own path can lead, how honest you need to be, and the cost it will inevitably exact. He\u2019s a pill and selfish and sometimes incredibly sad and one of the freest individuals I can think of. He does not give a fuck about protocol and proprieties, and he has lived long enough to show that he has been right more often than he was wrong. As his friend Miles Forst once said, \u201cThere is no peace in him.\u201d\n\nFrank pushes people hard, testing their loyalty and weakness. In the middle of the National Gallery\u2019s assemblage of a major exhibition on Frank\u2019s career, its curators sent him a catalog showing everything they wanted to use. He cut out all but two or three images from The Americans and then sent it back. He didn\u2019t want that work included, curator Sarah Greenough told a Washington audience, \u201cbecause he was bored with it.\u201d The stubbornness was no fluke. In the middle of editing a book-length overview of Frank\u2019s film and video work, that project\u2019s co-editor was told Frank wouldn\u2019t give her an interview, wouldn\u2019t come to her retrospective of his work, and didn\u2019t have copies of his work to share with her. Then he retracted permission to show his films in the retrospective and ordered her not to publish any of his photographs or film stills in the book. This was tough love \u2014 or just tough. Such actions, the editor decided, \u201cwiped away his fear of repeating himself and guaranteed uniqueness \u2026 Without realizing it at first, we would be actors under Robert Frank\u2019s direction.\u201d It is through such difficulties, by the things that keep you from taking the established route and force one to improvise, that something new comes into being. That has been his experience, and he offers this understanding to others when he can. Make plans with him at your peril. Events change on the ground.\n\nEarly in 2016 a New York University art gallery presented a career overview, and it was announced that the 91-year-old himself would attend the opening and take questions from an audience. It seemed like another chance to make my case. So I went, and after a short question-and-answer session a side door in the room opened onto Mercer Street. He walked past a cloud of photographers and video cameras and headed into Greenwich Village. Frank was walking down the block by himself, cane in hand, motoring along.\n\nI introduced myself, and he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m writing a book about you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou are writing a book?\u201d he said in his Swiss-German accent. He looked amused. \u201cGood luck!\u201d\n\nI explained I was pretty far along, that I had been to Zurich and seen the building he grew up in, the schools he\u2019d attended.\n\n\u201cSay hello to the mountains!\u201d he said heartily.\n\nWe talked a little, the smile stayed on his face, and his step picked up as he headed for the van at the end of the block that would drive him back to his building on Bleecker Street. Friends of his have said he sometimes gets confused, and his body is wearing out. But Frank was charging down the street now, his shoulders powerful, his thoughts all in order. He arrived at the van, and I shook his hand.\n\n\u201cYou caught him on a good day,\u201d Frank\u2019s friend Jim Jarmusch would say later.\n\nFrank\u2019s 7 Bleecker Street, September, from 1993.
