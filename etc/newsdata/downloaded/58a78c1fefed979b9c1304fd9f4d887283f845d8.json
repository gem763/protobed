The sensors receive music played in real-time and the sound is transmitted as sensation into the shirt.\n\nFrancesca Rosella, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief creative officer, said the technology gives deaf people a chance to experience music through feeling.\n\nA person wearing the shirt can feel a \u201cseries of haptic sensations\u201d, which create a feeling of touch on their body which aligns with the music being played.\n\n\u201cInside the shirt - that by the way is completely textiles, there are no wires inside, so we\u2019re only using smart fabrics - we have a combination of microelectronics ... very thin and flexible, and conductive fabrics,\u201d she said.", "description": "A high-tech jacket is giving deaf people the chance to \u201cfeel music\u201d through an immersive experience that aims to open the doors of gigs and concerts to the hard of hearing for the first time.", "authors": ["Hasan Chowdhury", "Tom Hoggins", "Harry De Quetteville"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/09/Sound-Shirt-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
