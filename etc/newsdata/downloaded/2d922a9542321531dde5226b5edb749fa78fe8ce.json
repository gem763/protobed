Instead, America\u2019s most-admired unicorns are being outshone\u2026by a company that makes veggie burgers.\n\nInitial public offerings \u2014 when corporations allow their shares to start trading on stock exchanges \u2014 don\u2019t always make headline news. But 2019 has been a big exception, with hot names Uber, Lyft and Pinterest all going public.\n\nThe standout, however, isn\u2019t some Silicon Valley darling. It\u2019s L.A.-based Beyond Meat, a company that whose plant-based burgers have become a hit with American diners.\n\nIn fact, Beyond Meat, which started trading May 2, has seen its shares climb six-fold from $25 to more than $155. \u201cIt was like a shot out of the gate,\u201d says Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a research company that specializes in IPOs.\n\nBy contrast Uber, which began trading just over a week later on May 10, is down 26%, and its rival Lyft has slumped 35% since its IPO on March 29. Pinterest has provided investors with a handsome return, although not on the sale of Beyond Meat. The social media company is up 58%.\n\nWhat Happened to Uber?\n\nHow did Beyond Meat leave the others \u2014 and especially Uber \u2014 in the dust?\n\nA lot of it has to do with timing. Despite its lackluster stock performance, Uber remains a gigantic company. Uber\u2019s May IPO pegged its value at more than $80 billion \u2014 making it the largest tech IPO of its generation. But Uber\u2019s growth is already slowing.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, Uber\u2019s revenue climbed from less than $500 million to more than $11 billion \u2014 a 20-fold increase in just four years. When the company reported earnings last month, however, it revealed a different picture. Revenue had increased just 14% over the past year, signaling solid but hardly fantastic growth.\n\nOr course, investors might not mind if Uber was profitable. But it\u2019s also been bleeding red ink. One big reason: Uber drivers have been demanding higher pay. But ultra-fierce competition with rivals like traditional taxis and Lyft mean it\u2019s unlikely Uber will be able to raise prices anytime soon. In fact, Uber recently said it expects to lose $3 billion this year.\n\nAs investors tuned in to Uber\u2019s predicament, the company\u2019s market value has sunk from $80 billion all the way to $58 billion.\n\nBeyond Meat\n\nIf Uber\u2019s big growth spurt is over, Beyond Meat\u2019s appears to be ramping up.\n\nWith 2018 sales of just $87 million, Beyond Meat\u2019s May IPO pegged the company\u2019s value at $1.5 billion, a tiny fraction of Uber\u2019s. Beyond Meat\u2019s small size meant it had plenty of room to grow, and grow it did, as Americans became fascinated with the verisimilitude of a new generation of meatless burgers.\n\nSoon Internet taste tests were everywhere and even fast food joints were rushing to add burgers from Beyond Meat and its competitors to their menus.\n\nAll that helped Beyond Meat\u2019s sales nearly quadruple last quarter, as the company said it could hit $240 million for the full year. As a result, Beyond Meat\u2019s value has soared to nearly $10 billion.\n\nIs Beyond Meat a Good Investment?\n\nBeyond Meat\u2019s success seems to prove Americans are willing embrace veggie burgers, a menu item that, let\u2019s face it, has long been something of an afterthought. Of course, just because a company offers a product you love doesn\u2019t mean you want to own its stock. Uber\u2019s performance, if nothing else, should be evidence of that.\n\nDespite its strong start, Beyond Meat faces hurdles. While Americans associate plant-based food with health, Beyond Meat\u2019s burgers have plenty of salt and saturated fat, something that may give consumers pause as the novelty wears off and more of them look closely at the ingredients. In addition, like Uber has Lyft, Beyond Meat has its own competition from rival producers like Impossible Burger.\n\nStill, says Smith, the biggest obstacle for Beyond Meat investors may be its share price. With a market value of nearly $10 billion, Beyond Meat is currently trading at more than 45 times projected sales. By contrast the typical stock in the S&P 500 trades at factor of roughly two times sales.\n\nIn other words, while Beyond Meat may have been overlooked when it began trading this past May. That\u2019s no longer the case. Investors expect the moon and if Beyond Meat doesn\u2019t deliver, they could be disappointed.", "description": "Is it too late for investors to feast on its stock?", "authors": ["Ian Salisbury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6Kv9tzf0BpE2hsq0w4G2NQ--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/2ee4dc62bd6253381cc0e3f3fd0f9cb3", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
