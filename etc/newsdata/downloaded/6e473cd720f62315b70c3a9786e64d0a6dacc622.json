An analysis of Nielsen Music data suggested Jackson\u2019s songs were played an average of 14,000 per week on radio in the month before HBO first aired the movie, while stations have played his music roughly 11,000 times weekly in the months since, the report said.\n\nJackson died in 2009 at the age of 50. Allegations of child molestation had dogged him since the early 1990s, though the release of \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d called graphic attention to the claims and put the future of his posthumous career in question. Radio stations in several countries stopped playing Jackson\u2019s music in response, and he was publicly denounced by a number of his past collaborators.\n\nA poll conducted in early March following the film\u2019s release found that 16% of respondents said they had stopped listening to Jackson\u2019s music.\n\nJackson\u2019s estate has disputed the documentary\u2019s claims and is suing HBO for $100 million.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
