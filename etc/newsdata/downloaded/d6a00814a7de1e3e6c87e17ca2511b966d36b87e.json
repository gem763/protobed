Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nWBAG:HST Historical Dividend Yield, October 30th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau paid out 56% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20ac1.60 in 2009, compared to \u20ac1.40 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 1.3% a year during that period. Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 1.3% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.\n\nA shrinking dividend over a ten-year period is not ideal, and we'd be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau's EPS have fallen by approximately 13% per year. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, we think Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau has an acceptable payout ratio. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has cut its dividend at least once in the past. From a dividend perspective, this is a cause for concern. With this information in mind, we think Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau may not be an ideal dividend stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Hutter & Schrantz Stahlbau AG (VIE:HST) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
