Or maybe you aren't the most traditional couple and don't want a religious ceremony. Plus, the stress of planning the perfect ceremony can give anyone a migraine.\n\nFor me, it was a combination of all of those things.\n\nWhen my husband Julian proposed to me on our living room couch after a rather heated conversation, I thought he was kidding. We've done that bit before. It wasn't until the next day when he called me at work that I knew he was serious. The conversation went a little like this:\n\n\"How's March 27?\" he asked.\n\n\"For what?\" I said.\n\n\"To get married, I have the courthouse on the other line.\"\n\n\"Oh! OK, sure, sounds good.\"\n\n\"Morning or afternoon?\"\n\n\"Afternoon, definitely.\"\n\nAnd so it was. Three weeks later, we got married in a Salt Lake City courthouse on March 27 at 3:30 p.m.\n\nOne could argue a transaction like this is incredibly unromantic, but I would hit back with this: Generally, grand gestures make me gag. The idea that my husband would get down on one knee and recite a pre-rehearsed speech is something I could never picture. Bridesmaids? A white dress? A year's worth of planning? Guests gawking as my father gives me away? Count me out.\n\nThis is why a courthouse wedding made sense to my husband and me \u2014 we were able to craft the marriage experience how we wanted, without the extra dollars, late-night stress, and cringey, courtesy invites that come with a more traditional ceremony. And I'm sure if you were there when our seven-minute ceremony took place, you'd say it was anything but unromantic.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the five reasons I skipped the ceremony and had a courthouse wedding.", "description": "Choosing to have a courthouse wedding saved us money, stress, and allowed us to have more control over what we wanted for our wedding day celebration.", "authors": ["Meira Gebel"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db73c38dee0192c2c71682b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
