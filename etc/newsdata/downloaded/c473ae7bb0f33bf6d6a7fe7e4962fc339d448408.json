That was the shared assumption for quite some time,\u201d said Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of Mozilla in Mountain View, California.\n\n\u201cThe defense was that liberty or human expression was embodied in the technology coming out of Silicon Valley and was undisputedly good,\u201d she said.\n\nThe gathering is taking place amid the rise of cyber espionage, online hate speech and misuse of private data, and signs the industry is struggling to respond.\n\nThe conference, whose opening session was open to the media before it went behind closed doors, is the latest example of the Vatican trying to stay ahead of the curve on technology and social issues in order to influence the movers and shakers of the future, regardless of their religion.\n\nVatican officials said it could provide material for a possible papal encyclical, or papal letter to Church members, on artificial intelligence, much as meetings with scientists helped shape his landmark 2015 encyclical \u201cLaudato Si\u201d on the protection of the environment and global warming.\n\nThe conference will discuss topics with tech jargon not commonly heard inside the Vatican such as algorithms and blockchain.\n\nPope Francis is due to address the conference on Friday.\n\nGavin Corn, associate general counsel and director of the cyber security law team at Facebook, described how it took down 1.5 million copies in 24 hours of the live streaming by the gunman who killed 51 people in New Zealand mosques last April.\n\n\u201cDespite all these efforts the video did go viral,\u201d he said, saying he was attending in a personal capacity.\n\nHe said it was important for tech companies to invest in teams of people to focus on the possible unethical use of products early on in their development.\n\n\u201cLot\u2019s of people working in the area of AI (artificial intelligence) are determined that this should be developed ethically,\u201d said Bishop Paul Tighe, secretary of the Vatican\u2019s Council for Culture. \u201cWe want it to be \u2018AI for good\u2019,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Vatican brought together Silicon Valley heavyweights, Nobel laureates and cyber experts on Friday to discuss the ethical use of digital technology, in a meeting officials said could provide material for a possible papal document on artificial intelligence.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434156691&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P171", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
