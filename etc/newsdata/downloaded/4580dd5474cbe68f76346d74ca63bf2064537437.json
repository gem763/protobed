The Organization of American States and the European Union have called for an audit and the government has said it endorses a recount.\n\nIsolated incidents of violence have broken out and demonstrations by supporters of both sides look set to continue, raising the risk of clashes.\n\nBetween the lines: Morales\u2019s star was already fading, in the wake of corruption scandals, leadership fatigue and economic anxiety.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2013, when mineral-rich Bolivia benefitted from the global commodities boom, Morales commanded 60% majorities at the polls and was seen as a regional icon of both indigenous political identity and responsible leftwing nationalism, singularly capable of balancing social transformation among the poor with growth for the business sector.\n\nWith those free-spending days in past, Bolivia still grows 3%\u20134% a year, faster than most of its neighbors. But without any major natural gas discoveries of late, Morales faces tough economic decisions and has fewer options to prop up the public spending that benefits his rural base.\n\nWhat to watch: Morales has pledged to respect the result, while accusing the opposition of mounting a coup. If he prevails, he could still end up with a smaller majority in the legislature and may feel pressed to tighten his grip on power in order to enact his agenda.\n\nMichael McCarthy is a research fellow at American University\u2019s CLALS, an adjunct professor at George Washington University's Elliott School for International Affairs, and the founder and CEO of Caracas Wire.", "description": "Current results put him just shy of avoiding a runoff election in December.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/fHf0-nmWYlcGFGee8E6VKrqBpwU=/0x43:4608x2635/1920x1080/2019/10/22/1571769228008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
