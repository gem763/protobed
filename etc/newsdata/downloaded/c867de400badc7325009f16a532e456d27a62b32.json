According to TMZ, March passed away Thursday after suffering a heart attack. His death comes two years after the designer suffered a serious fall that lead to him being placed into a medically-induced coma, a health crisis from which March was still in recovery. The designer is perhaps best known to Project Runway fans from his jaw-dropping work with human hair in season four of the Bravo fashion competition show, and even more so, from host Tim Gunn\u2019s stunned reaction to it.\n\nIn addition to his design work for stars like Lady Gaga, Madonna, Meryl Streep and Beyonc\u00e9 on the singer\u2019s I Am\u2026 Tour, March went on to compete in the 2009 special Project Runway: All-Star Challenge and season 4 of Project Runway All Stars. He also starred in his own reality show on Bravo entitled Mad Fashion in 2011, and made appearances on The Real Housewives of New York City in conjuncture with his costuming work for Sonja Morgan. Bravo\u2019s own Andy Cohen remembered March on Instagram Friday while wearing one of his creations, calling him a \u201cjoy and a delight.\u201d", "description": "Project Runway alum and season four finalist Chris March has died at the age of 56 after suffering a heart attack, following a serious fall two years prior that lead to a coma.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/6-Chris-March.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
