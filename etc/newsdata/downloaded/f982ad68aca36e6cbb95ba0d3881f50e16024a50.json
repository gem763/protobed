It made a lot of noise, it was even exciting, but when it was said and done, the session was a gutter ball.\n\nThe market breadth exposed a session much tougher than just a 96-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nNYSE\n\nAdvancing: 1,093\n\nDecliners: 1,821\n\nUp Volume: 1.046 billion\n\nDown Volume: 1.927 billion\n\nNew Highs: 77\n\nNew Lows: 36\n\nNASDAQ\n\nAdvancing Issues:1,313\n\nDeclining Issues: 1,801\n\nUp Volume: 749.8 million\n\nDown Volume: 1.006 billion\n\nNew Highs: 28\n\nNew Lows 87\n\nInclination Definition\n\n(noun): a person's natural tendency or urge to act or feel in a way; a disposition or propensity.\n\nAfter the close, President Trump told reporters his \u201cinclination\u201d is for a large and complete deal, rather than a piecemealed deal in negotiations with China that were suggested as \u2018more of a reality\u2019 by many people. Equity futures didn\u2019t react, even though they seem to open the door for a mini deal as part of a series of additional deal milestones.\n\nYesterday, the market perfectly reflected the angst of trade negotiations, coupled with the angst of potentially missing a big upside reaction at the conclusion.\n\nHas the Tanker Ship Come In?\n\nHas the shipping industry ship finally come in? It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve talked about the tanker industry, which is enjoying a massive spurt in excitement and opportunity. Yesterday, shares of Teekay Tankers (TK) rallied 17.2% to $1.70, as rates to ship American crude to Asia continue to surge.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s top refiner, SK Energy booked the Pacific M supertanker to ship U.S. crude to the country at $12.35 million, eclipsing the prior record of $10.0 million for charting the Maxim just one week earlier.\n\nDry Bulk Bulks Up\n\nAll the attention on oil tanker fees has put the spotlight on dry bulk shipping, which has been in a very powerful, yet stealthy in the rally this year. Twenty years ago, there was a time when the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) became all the rage, and many talked of it replacing the Dow Jones Transportation Index (DJT) as a better gauge of the industrial economy.\n\nThe overcapacity (the world\u2019s fleet doubled from 2010 to 2013).\n\nA lot of that was purchased on credit, and it eventually drove the index to the bottom of the ocean, but is it time to take a second look?\n\nBDI Composition\n\n30% Panamax (sized to transverse the Panama Canal)\n\n30% Supramax\n\n40% Capesize (mostly too large for the Panama Canal), so they must navigate the globe via Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn\n\nThe BDI closed at 1,767 yesterday; up 37% for the year, down from September 9th high of 2,457. We are looking deeper into the new shipping story, as there could be amazing opportunities. After a couple of decades of trying to pick the bounce only to see positions sink, I\u2019m going to be very careful.\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 3 1 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 2 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 2\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nSaber-rattling has gotten more intense ahead of the trade talks, but there has been action too reflecting the administrations belief in maximum pressure.\n\nChina Trade Talks Plot Thickets\n\nWords\n\nRemarks by President Trump at Signing of the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement and U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement\n\nQ On Hong Kong, sir, are the Hong Kong protests linked, in your view, to the China trade negotiations in any way?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019d like to see a very humane solution to that. I hope that\u2019s going to happen. And, you know, Hong Kong is very important as a world hub \u2014 not just for China, but for the world. And you have great people over there.\n\nI see they\u2019re flying the American flags. They even have signs: \u201cMake China Great Again.\u201d \u201cMake Hong Kong Great Again.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying, \u201cGet those signs.\u201d But they have, you know, tremendous signage and tremendous \u2014 they have a tremendous spirit for our country. They have a lot of American flags, a lot of Trump signs.\n\nI\u2019d just like to see a humane deal be worked out. And I think President Xi has the ability to do it.\n\nQ Did you tell Xi Jinping in any way that you would be quiet about Hong Kong protests during the course of these negotiations?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I didn\u2019t. But I do say that we are negotiating. If anything happened bad, I think that would be a very bad for the negotiation. I think, politically, it would be very tough maybe for us, and maybe for some others, and maybe for him.\n\nQ Mr. President, would you accept a partial trade deal with China? There has been some talk today about whether or not it could be headed in that direction.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s a very good question. I think it\u2019s not what we prefer at all. They are starting to buy a lot of our agricultural products. You see that. They\u2019re coming in very strong on pork, also \u2014 very, very strong \u2014 and in particular. But on other products, that \u2014 so, I don\u2019t know if you call that a \u201cpartial.\u201d We don\u2019t have an agreement.\n\nMy inclination is to get a big deal. We\u2019ve come this far. We\u2019re doing well. Again, the fact that they\u2019ve done what they\u2019ve done with their currency \u2014 the devaluation \u2014 it really has not increased prices. And now we\u2019re talking China. It doesn\u2019t mean that in all cases that happens; other countries prices increase, but in the case of China that hasn\u2019t happened. And they put a lot of money into their goods. They want to keep their people working. I understand that very well.\n\nBut I think that we\u2019ll just have to see what happens. I would much prefer a big deal. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for. Can something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows? But I think it\u2019s probably unlikely. Okay?\n\nDeeds\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce Adds 28 Chinese Organizations to its Entity List\n\nhttps://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2019/10/us-department-commerce-adds-28-chinese-organizations-its-entity-list\n\nToday, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce announced that it will add 28 Chinese governmental and commercial organizations to the Entity List for engaging in or enabling activities contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States. This action constricts the export of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to entities that have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in China\u2019s campaign targeting Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u201d said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. \u201cThis action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenseless minority populations.\u201d\n\nStocks to Watch include AMBA.\n\nPaging Powell\n\nJay Powell speaks today at NABE\n\nNABE statement has set up an intriguing chance for Powell to articulate more rate cuts in front of an audience that has gone against Wall Street\u2019s conventional wisdom (these are economists, so they aren't as worried about the market and their opinions are more rooted in pure number crunching than intangibles like the emotional swoons the street has to deal with see summary below).\n\nIf Powell goes out of his way to refute this, it would be huge news for the market and would be good to hear. If he is nebulous, then it could be a non-factor, although a slight disappointing.\n\nSUMMARY: \u201cNABE Outlook Survey panelists believe the U.S. economy will continue to expand into 2020, but they anticipate GDP growth will fall below 2% next year for the first time since 2016,\u201d said NABE President Constance Hunter, CBE, chief economist, KPMG.\n\nGDP Estimates\n\n2018 2.9%\n\n2019 2.3%\n\n2020 1.8% The rise in protectionism Pervasive trade policy uncertainty Slower global growth\n\n\n\nFed Rate Action\n\n2019\n\n\u2022 60% no additional cuts\n\n\u2022 40% see one more cut\n\n2020\n\n\u2022 75% one rate cut\n\n\u2022 35% two rate cuts\n\nPowell must also grapple with the PPI, which came in at -0.3, even core was -0.3. I keep saying, the Fed should fight deflation now.", "description": "On Monday, the market bounced around like a ball inside .10/08/2019 20:37:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/302/05fcdb00-2dfe-41ba-8059-1cce0d0b74f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
