A rising wedge breakdown seen on the hourly chart favors a drop to levels below $8,000.\n\nA close above Monday\u2019s high of $8,368 is needed to weaken bearish pressures. A bullish close, if confirmed, could yield a break above $9,000.\n\nBitcoin is better bid on the first day of the fourth quarter, but the relief rally is struggling to gather traction above a key former support-turned-resistance.\n\nThe top cryptocurrency is currently changing hands at $8,330 on Bitstamp, representing a 7 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.\n\nPrices hit a high of $8,519 earlier today. At that level, the cryptocurrency was up $804 or 10.4 percent from the 3.5-month low of $7,715 reached in the Asian trading hours on Monday.\n\nA recovery rally was expected, as the cryptocurrency was looking oversold on Monday, having dropped by more than $2,000 last week.\n\nSo far, however, a sustained break above the 200-day moving average (MA) resistance at $8,440 has remained elusive.\n\nThe 200-day MA is widely considered a barometer of the long-term trend. The cryptocurrency is said to be in a bull market if it is charting higher lows above the key MA, while lower lows below the long-term average is taken as a sign of bear market.\n\nFurther, the average line proved a tough nut to crack on Saturday, after which a fresh wave of selling ended up pushing prices to lows near $7,700.\n\nPut simply, the 200-day MA is a crucial resistance, which if breached, may invite buying pressure.\n\nMoreover, a convincing break above the 200-day MA would strengthen the narrative put forward by the likes of popular twitter analyst Crypto Bitlord that BTC may have bottomed out near $7,700.\n\nWhile Crypto Bitlord is calling a bullish move to $9,000, market analyst Josh Rager is expecting consolidation.\n\nThe outlook would turn bullish above $8,800, according to Rager. That said, a convincing break above $8,800 may not happen immediately, as technical studies are still biased bearish and the rally seen in the last 24 hours is lacking substance.\n\n4-hour and hourly charts\n\nBitcoin witnessed a double bottom breakout on the 4-hour chart in the Asian trading hours, opening doors for a rise to $8,900 (target as per the measured move method).\n\nThe breakout, however, lacked volume support. In fact, trading volumes have remained low throughout the price rise from $7,715 to $8,519. A low-volume recovery is often short-lived.\n\nThe hourly chart is reporting a rising wedge breakdown \u2013 a bearish reversal pattern that indicates the corrective rally has ended and prices could fall back below $8,000 in the next 24 hours.\n\nThe case for a rise to $8,900 would strengthen if a move above $8,500 is accompanied by a surge in buying volumes.\n\nDaily chart\n\nBitcoin is currently struggling to beat the 200-day MA resistance.\n\nThe cryptocurrency created a bullish outside bar candle yesterday, signaling seller exhaustion.\n\nA short-term bullish reversal would be confirmed if prices print a UTC close above $8,368 today, validating Monday\u2019s outside bar candle. That could yield a sustained move to $9,000.\n\nHowever, the outlook as per the longer duration technical charts will remain bearish as long as prices are held below $9,097, as discussed yesterday.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin image via CoinDesk Archives; charts by Trading View", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_786941158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
