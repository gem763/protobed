He was convicted on one charge of taking the photo.\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration as the convening authority, Adm. [Mike] Gilday decided to uphold the sentence as adjudged by a jury of Gallagher\u2019s peers but disapproved the automatic reduction in rate to E-1,\u201d Navy Cmdr. Nate Christensen said.\n\nGallagher attorney Timothy Parlatore said he was disappointed his client didn\u2019t receive clemency for misconduct of Navy officials during the court-martial and the less serious nature of the offense.\n\nHis reduction in rank to E-6 will cost Gallagher $200,000 when he retires, Parlatore said.\n\nGallagher was charged with multiple war crimes, including shooting civilians in Iraq and murdering a wounded Islamic State fighter in 2017. A jury of mostly Marine combat veterans convicted him on only the photo charge.\n\nThe case was marred by leaks and accusations that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service sent email trackers to Gallagher\u2019s defense attorneys and to a reporter in the weeks before the trial. Also, a key witness said he killed the Islamic State fighter, not Gallagher.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered the Navy in August to rescind the medals awarded to Gallagher\u2019s prosecutors, saying they were \u201cridiculously given.\u201d\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said the case demonstrates the military justice system is \u201ccompletely broken and desperately requires a complete overhaul.\u201d\n\nHunter, co-founder of Justice for Warriors Caucus, called the ruling \u201cmind boggling\u201d and requested a presidential pardon for Gallagher. Justice for Warriors Caucus advocates for service members in the military justice system.", "description": "Oct. 30 (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Navy\u2019s top officer has upheld a jury\u2019s punishment for a Navy SEAL for posing for a photograph next to the body", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
