I\u2019ve watched Adam Schiff leak. He\u2019s a corrupt politician. He\u2019s a leaker like nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Special Forces raid in Syria over the weekend resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, one of the world\u2019s most wanted extremists.\n\nTypically, presidents notify the top Senate and House leaders in each party about highly sensitive military raids. Mr. Schiff is also leading the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry of the president.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding the White House provide lawmakers with a briefing on the raid, complaining that the U.S. notified Russia but kept top congressional Democrats in the dark.
