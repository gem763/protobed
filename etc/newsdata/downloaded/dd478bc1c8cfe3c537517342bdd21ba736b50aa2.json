The archives are held at Oxford University.\n\nProfessor Dirk Obbink has been accused of selling the precious artefacts to Steve Green, who spent $500,000 opening the museum in 2017.\n\nThe ancient texts, which date from the 3rd to the 7th Century, are part of the Oxyrhynchus collection - 500,000 fragments of papyrus and parchment discovered in an Egyptian rubbish dump by two British explorers in 1890.\n\nProfessor Dirk Obbink (pictured) has been accused of selling the precious artefacts to Steve Green, who spent $500,000 opening the museum in 2017\n\nThe ancient texts, which date from the 3rd to the 7th Century, are part of the Oxyrhynchus collection - 500,000 fragments of papyrus and parchment discovered in an Egyptian rubbish dump by two British explorers in 1890\n\nThe papyri, which were preserved beneath drifted sand, documented everyday life such as shopping lists, but copies of the New Testament were also found.\n\nAn apparent contract between Mr Green, the son of the founder of American arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby, and Prof Obbink was released by a researcher at the museum.\n\nThe document, which details the sale of several texts, was redacted and the sale price is not known. However, it was published online by an Australian academic yesterday.\n\nA statement from the EES online said the texts were taken 'without authorisation' from the collection and it is investigating whether any other items are missing.\n\nA year after the alleged sale, Prof Obbink, who is from Nebraska but based at Christ Church and at the university's Classics department, is said to have bought a castle in Texas and sold it this year for around \u00a3400,000.\n\nThe Museum of the Bible is said to have 'accepted' the EES's right to ownership and would immediately return the texts.\n\nThe papyri, which were preserved beneath drifted sand, documented everyday life such as shopping lists, but copies of the New Testament were also found.

A spokeswoman for the museum said: 'The items referenced were acquired by Hobby Lobby Stores in good faith between 2010 and 2013, but sold by a known expert from Oxford University'.\n\nA spokesman for Oxford University said it had launched an investigation with the ESS 'to seek to establish the facts'.\n\nProf Obbink told the Daily Beast in 2018 the claim he sold the fragment of the first chapter of the Gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby 'is not true'.\n\n(LEGAL MUST KEEP IN) Prof Obbink did not respond to The Times, The Washington Post and The Daily Telegraph's requests for comment.", "description": "Oxford professor Dirk Obbink has been accused of selling the precious artefacts to Steve Green, who spent $500,000 opening the Museum of the Bible in Washington in 2017.", "authors": ["Susie Coen For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/01/19765194-0-image-a-19_1571184070934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
