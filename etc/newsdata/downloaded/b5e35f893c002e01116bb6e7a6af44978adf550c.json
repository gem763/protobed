The host: Elton John. The dinner-party guests: Sylvester Stallone, Richard Gere, Princess Diana, and some other rich people. Enter stage right: a duel of the heart! As relayed in a new excerpt from John\u2019s upcoming memoir, a party he threw at his British manse quickly took a turn to the testosterone thanks to Gere\u2019s and Stallone\u2019s behavior, who were both, apparently, hell-bent on seducing a newly single Lady Di upon their arrival. (She and Prince Charles divorced the year prior.) \u201cThe most peculiar scene developed. Straightaway, Richard Gere and Diana seemed very taken with each other,\u201d John recalled in his memoir. \u201cThey ended up sitting in front of the fireplace together, locked in rapt conversation. Judging by the kind of looks he kept shooting them, Diana and Richard Gere\u2019s newly blossoming friendship was not going down well with Sylvester Stallone at all.\u201d\n\nAn hour or so went by like this, until all of the guests were corralled to eat at the dinner table. However, Stallone and Gere were nowhere to be found, so John\u2019s now-husband, David Furnish, went looking for them. \u201cIt transpired that he\u2019d discovered Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere in the corridor, squaring up to each other, apparently about to settle their differences over Diana by having a fist-fight,\u201d John writes. \u201cAfter dinner, Diana and Richard Gere resumed their position together in front of the fire, and Sylvester stormed off home.\u201d Stallone, really, was not pleased!\n\n\u201cI never would have come,\u201d he snapped, as David and I showed him to the door, \u201cif I\u2019d known Prince f***in\u2019 Charming was gonna be here.\u201d Then he added: \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted her, I would\u2019ve taken her!\u201d We managed to wait until his car was out of sight before we started laughing. Back in our living room, Diana and Richard Gere were still gazing raptly at each other. She seemed completely unruffled.\n\nAnd so he squandered his chance to be Harry and William\u2019s new stepfather.", "description": "In his new memoir excerpt, Elton John wrote how Sylvester Stallone attempted to seduce Princess Diana but failed, thanks to Richard Gere.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-princess-diana-sylvester-stallone-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
