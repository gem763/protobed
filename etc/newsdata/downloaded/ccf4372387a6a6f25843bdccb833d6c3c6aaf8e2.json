It requires consideration, thinking, quiet and measured and rational decisions.\u201d Cristine Lagarde\n\n\u201cIf you shave off, you know, almost a percentage point of growth that means less investment, less jobs, more unemployment, reduced growth. So of course it has an impact,\u201d she told CBS News\u2019s John Dickerson. Lagarde urged policymakers to \u201cplease sit down like big men\u201d and make a deal.\n\nLagarde said that if Brexit finally goes through, the ripple effects will touch not just Britain and the EU, but the U.S. as well, because of the connected global economy.\n\nThat same interconnectedness makes nationalism \u2014 a concept that Trump has touted \u2014 self-defeating, she said.\n\n\u201cInternational trade, connections, movement of people and movement of capital has taken hundreds of millions out of poverty. Now, some people in the advanced economies might say, \u2018Pooh. What do I care?\u2019 Well, of course we care for the person next door. And because of the interconnections, next door is not down the pathway, next door is everywhere around the world. And if my neighbors from across a border are feeling desperate, are starving, are fighting, there will be consequences back at home.\u201d Christine Lagarde\n\n\u201cWhat can walls do about pandemics?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat can walls do about terrorism? What can walls do about climate change and destruction of the environment? This is not the answer to the global questions and issues that interconnect, whether we like it or not.\u201d\n\nLagarde added that for the economy of the future to thrive, women must have a central role. Women assess risk better, she said, and more women should be in executive roles.\n\n\u201cPoverty is sexist and we have to remember that and make sure that women are not forgotten,\u201d she said.", "description": "Christine Lagarde, former head of the International Monetary Fund, says President Donald Trump is responsible for many of the risks facing the global...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT668_lagard_ZG_20191020204408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
