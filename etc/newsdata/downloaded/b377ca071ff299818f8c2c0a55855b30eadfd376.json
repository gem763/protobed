(Picture: Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office/Obituary)\n\nAn enraged naked man beat a Peeping Tom to death after catching him outside his girlfriend\u2019s bedroom window while they had sex, police say.\n\nVictor Vickery, 30, was arrested on Thursday for killing Asaad Akar, 57, who had reportedly been watching Vickery have sex with his girlfriend, Samantha Hobi, on July 3, 2018 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nVickery told police that he had spotted a Peeping Tom outside the window before, but the man fled before authorities arrived.\n\nThis time, Vickery reportedly charged outside, still naked, and caught Akar with his genitals exposed. Police say Akar had prior convictions for prowling.\n\nVickery began fighting with Akar. Hobi called police and can be heard in a recording of the call repeatedly saying, \u2018Tori stop. Tori that\u2019s enough,\u2019 according to the Sun Sentinel.\n\nAccording to Akar\u2019s obituary, he was \u2018a devoted son to his ailing mother, and a kind soul, who was generous with his time and knowledge, to all that needed him.\u2019 (Picture: Obituary)\n\nIn a police interview, Vickery said Akar lunged at him and began choking him. He continued to say that he kicked and punched Akar \u2018a handful of times\u2019 then held him down on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHobi told investigators that she hit Akar with a shovel after she saw him choking Vickery \u2013 but she later changed her story to say that Vickery coerced her to say that, denying that she ever touched Akar.\n\nWoman 'viciously stabbed boyfriend to death to try and get closer to sex buddy'\n\nAkar was taken to a local hospital after the incident and later died of his injuries.\n\nHobi and Vickery reportedly had a tumultuous relationship before the July 2018 incident. She twice filed restraining orders against Vickery, who was awaiting trial for felony sex battery when he was arrested last week for manslaughter.\n\nCourt records shows that the sexual battery incident took place weeks after Akar was beaten to death, although police have not released many details regarding the case.\n\nVickery pleaded not guilty to the sexual battery charge, as well as to charges of burglary. He is currently being held in jail on a $100,000 bond.\n\nAccording to Akar\u2019s obituary, he was \u2018a devoted son to his ailing mother, and a kind soul, who was generous with his time and knowledge, to all that needed him.\u2019", "description": "Victor Vickery, 30, was arrested on Thursday for killing Asaad Akar, 57, on July 3, 2018 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1571662962_1571664535.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
