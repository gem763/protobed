Excitable children were jostling for position around the water, sticking their hands in to touch the fish. I found a space to crouch down with our one-year-old daughter, lifting her up so she too could put her little hands out and have a feel of a scaly body.\n\nWhooomph. A shocking stream of milky coloured, lumpy vomit came out of her mouth like a waterfall, landing in the water. I quickly moved her so the stream was no longer a direct hit on the oblivious fish, who were now devouring their unexpected meal.\n\nMy partner scoured the building to find a staff member to clean the mess, which was harder than it should have been. He went all the way back to the entrance before he found someone who seemed to care. Meanwhile an employee who walked into the area in the aftermath merely shrugged his shoulders and said he was only there to hand out the fish food.", "description": "My other half and I had prioritised starting a family over marriage.", "authors": ["Katherine", "Hattie Garlick"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/paris%2520baby-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
