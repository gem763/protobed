PRECIOUS-Gold edges up on U.S.-China tariffs; dollar caps upside\n\n* SPDR Gold Trust holdings rise 12% so far this year\n\n* Specs raise bullish stance in gold and silver- CFTC\n\n* Gold could peak around $1,780/oz by end-2020: J.P. Morgan\n\n\n\n(New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments)\n\nBy K. Sathya Narayanan\n\nSept 2 (Reuters) - Gold rose slightly on Monday after the\n\nUnited States and China imposed new tariffs, as expected, on\n\neach others' goods but a firmer dollar limited gains.\n\nWashington began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of\n\nChinese goods on Sunday, including footwear, smart watches and\n\nflat-panel televisions, as Beijing began imposing new duties on\n\nU.S. crude. U.S. President Donald Trump said both sides would meet for\n\ntalks later this month.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.4% at $1,525.11 per ounce as of\n\n9:12 a.m. EDT (1312 GMT), a session after falling to a one-week\n\nlow at $1,517.11.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 were up 0.3% at $1,534.20 an\n\nounce.\n\nTrading could be subdued as U.S. financial markets were\n\nclosed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\n\"Overall, there is nothing going on apart from the fact that\n\nthe dollar is stronger. There was not so much reaction\" to the\n\ntariffs because they were \"well anticipated,\" ABN Amro analyst\n\nGeorgette Boele said.\n\nThe dollar was the highest in more than two years\n\nagainst a basket of currencies early in the session, making gold\n\ncostlier for investors holding other currencies.\n\n\"We can expect a correction in gold prices as it had moved\n\nup so quickly that you don't need so much to trigger profit\n\ntaking,\" Boele added.\n\nGold rose more than $100 in August due to the trade war,\n\nfears of a global economic downturn, negative yielding debt\n\naround the globe and hopes for interest rate cuts by central\n\nbanks.\n\n\"Despite the recent rally, we do not yet think a recession\n\nis fully discounted in the gold price and we now see gold prices\n\npeaking at around $1,780 per ounce by year-end 2020 and\n\naveraging $1,418 in 2019 and $1,724 in 2020,\" Wall Street bank\n\nJP Morgan said in an Aug. 28 note.\n\nHoldings HLDSPDRGT=XAU in the world's largest gold-backed\n\nexchange-traded fund (ETF), SPDR Gold Trust , have risen\n\nabout 12% this year. GOL/ETF\n\nSpeculators increased their bullish stance in COMEX gold and\n\nupped net long positions in silver contracts in the week to Aug.\n\n27, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed\n\non Friday. \"At current levels, both the CFTC and ETF positions remain\n\nbullish and are likely to continue to be so over the near term\n\nshould price action remain firm broadly around $1,500-$1,480,\"\n\nMKS PAMP said in a note.\n\nSilver gained 0.1% to $18.37 per ounce. Platinum\n\nXPT= slipped 0.3% to $927.67 per ounce, and palladium XPD=\n\nwas down 0.7% at $1,520.74.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold edges up on U.S.-China tariffs; dollar caps upside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC140H9_L.jpg"}
