He was the same over Harry. Stan was relentless over Harry.\n\n\"The thing with Harry is he had been playing for Sheffield United since he was 18 and had something like 150 games under his belt (at age 21). He had also been their Player of the Year three years running.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cBut people looked at him and asked, \u2018Is he slow on the turn?\u2019 I\u2019ll admit, I asked the same of Stan when he first came to me about Harry. Stan\u2019s reply was priceless, \u2018Well, you were slow on the turn and you did OK.'\n\n\u201cAs a manager, there is nothing better than seeing a player you worked with fulfil their potential. You have helped take them forward.\n\n\u201cI did have a chuckle, though, about the first time I saw Andy. It was when he walked into the training ground with his mum. I thought we\u2019d signed a schoolboy. I said to Stan, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 But he was adamant and I trusted his judgment.\u201d", "description": "Robertson and Maguire both arrived at Hull in 2014 and enjoyed three years at the club before deservedly earning moves to the big time", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646353.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Crystal-Palace-v-Hull-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
