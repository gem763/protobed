'Destroy the other party' instead of build the whole country up,\" said Richelle W., a 40-year-old Trump voter.\n\nBefore getting serious about impeachment, House Democrats worried the timing was too close to the 2020 election and could backfire at the polls.\n\nOne man, Rocco P., a 40-year-old Trump voter, offered this advice to Democrats: \"Just drop it. Beat Trump at the ballot box.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Harboring anti-impeachment feelings doesn't necessarily translate to a vote for Trump in 2020. Only four of the participants said they will definitely vote for Trump again; one former Trump voter said he will vote for Andrew Yang; one Clinton voter, Lisa A., said she's leaning toward Elizabeth Warren; and the rest are undecided.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
