Other specs are said to include up to 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 2-megapixel front-facing camera, a headphone jack, and the Titan C security chip seen in the Pixel Slate.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go appears to have an unusual ribbed texture on the bottom, which 9to5Google describes as \u201csomewhat similar to a washboard or the roof of a dog\u2019s mouth,\u201d so make of that what you will. The model that the site got its hands on has a coral color on the bottom with a matte finish on the top panel that\u2019s reminiscent of the \u201cNot Pink\u201d Pixel 3.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the device is a prototype \u2014 the Google logo has been swapped out for a placeholder, and another wordmark reads \u201cProductName\u201d above the keyboard. Still, it\u2019s an extensive look at what Google is likely to announce next week, so it\u2019s worth checking out 9to5Google\u2019s full gallery.\n\nGoogle\u2019s event is happening on Wednesday in New York City, and we will of course be there to bring you all the news on the Pixelbook Go, the even-more-leaked Pixel 4, and no doubt much more.", "description": "Ahead of Google\u2019s big hardware event next week, 9to5Google has gotten access to what it claims is a prototype of the company\u2019s new Chromebook, the Pixelbook Go. 9to5Google previously revealed specs and other details on the device last month.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2E-Ck9pxsVqNFrCai8rVferfYnc=/0x134:1876x1116/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19277740/pixelbook_go_prototype_hands_on_29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
