The region makes up more than a quarter of the country and is the largest area outside the control of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. It is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has announced an invasion of territory with the intention of forcing the SDF out of at least a 20-mile \u201csafe zone\u201d below its border.\n\nHow did the SDF come to control the region? Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobani, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.\n\nWhy does Turkey oppose the Kurds? For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey. Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.\n\n\n\nWhat are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border? Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region. Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.", "description": "Russian president says that he is not sure Turkey could prevent escape of prisoners", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6341badecb839ac2a7a192f91fc7879d77d47db/0_0_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e794cc250f604e5a4b936cde4ee61912", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
