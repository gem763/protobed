It was prepared before the latest escalation in the trade tensions between the EU and the United States that has paved the way for new U.S. tariffs on EU goods in a dispute over EU aircraft subsidies.\n\nOfficials said the text would not be changed, as it already called for urgent action to resolve trade disputes.\n\nEU ministers will also reiterate the need for a global deal to overhaul the taxation of digital firms in 2020, the document said. The EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm, has said the EU would move alone if no global agreement was reached by the set deadline.\n\nThe 28-nation bloc will urge stronger measures against tax avoidance at the global level, including mandatory disclosure rules for tax intermediaries, such as banks and accountants, and sanctions for tax havens.\n\nThe EU is set to update its blacklist of tax havens next week, shrinking it to nine jurisdictions with the planned removal of the United Arab Emirates and the Marshall Islands.", "description": "EU to urge G20 response on Facebook's Libra, calls for tech tax reform", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9316N_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
