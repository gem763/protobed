For the most part, when I\u2019ve been on the hunt a handful of conversations have led me to my next favourite thing. Most of my friends seem to have the same plan, which means that eventually, we reach a point where we\u2019ve all listened to and love the same podcasts, but have absolutely no idea what to listen to next.\n\nPod Search is exactly what it sounds like: a search engine for podcasts. The website and mobile app allows you to search for podcasts by topics, check out recently launched podcasts, and see what \u201ctop\u201d podcasts everyone else is listening to.\n\nCategories include Business, Comedy, Education, Health & Fitness, Crime & Law, Pop Culture, Religion, and (a lot) more. You can also search by keyword if there\u2019s something, in particular, you\u2019re looking for.\n\nImage: Pod Search\n\nWhen you find something that looks interesting, you can listen to show sample on the spot to get a feel for it and decide if it\u2019s for you.\n\nWhen you do find something you like, the service links to all the places you can potentially listen to it.\n\nFor instance, Serial Season 1, which renewed my own personal love of podcasts (and probably a million other people\u2019s as well) can be found on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Soundcloud, Pandora, and Podbay.\n\nOn the same page with Serial are links to other podcasts done by the same group. The idea being, of course, that if you like one you might like another as well.\n\nWhile you certainly can\u2019t be a recommendation from a friend that knows your style, if you\u2019re running low on suggestions the site can be a great place to dig up a few new podcasts to take out for a spin.", "description": "My official way of finding new podcasts has always been simply asking my friends.
