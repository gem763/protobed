Four photos in particular stood out because of what the models were wearing: bullet-ridden sweatshirts bearing the names of schools that have suffered mass shootings \u2014 specifically, Columbine, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\n\nIn an email statement to the Cut, designers Dieter Grams and Brick Owens outlined their intentions: \u201cWe wanted to make a comment on gun violence and the type of gun violence that needs preventative attention and what its origins are, while also empowering the survivors of tragedy through storytelling in the clothes.\u201d While some Instagram users left comments applauding the brand\u2019s commentary, a significantly larger number were quick to excoriate its execution. Last year, more than 110 people were killed or injured in school shootings across the U.S., making 2018 the worst year for gun violence in schools on record.\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways to use fashion and clothing to make sociopolitical commentary \u2014 this isn\u2019t it,\u201d one Instagram user posted under the photo of the sweatshirt for Sandy Hook Elementary, the school where, in 2012, a shooting claimed the lives of 20 children and six teachers. \u201cHow do you think the parents who saw their children\u2019s clothing with bullet holes through them feel seeing this? Comforted? Empowered? As if we are on the precipice of change?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how people close to actual victims of the aforementioned shootings felt: horrified. \u201cA company is make light of our pain and other\u2019s pain for fashion,\u201d reads a tweet from the memorial page for Vicki Soto, a teacher who was killed at Sandy Hook. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe designers responded with a statement that mentions \u201cmob mentality\u201d and cancel culture. \u201cPeople get the opportunity to form their opinions before they get all the information and here we see the internal desire of society rear its head,\u201d it reads. \u201cPeople seem to want to release hateful energy as a default.\u201d\n\nWhile Bstroy told the Cut that they\u2019re not currently selling the sweatshirt, they\u2019re now considering whether to capitalize. \u201cThe hoodies have only been shown not sold and the school shooting hoodies were initially intended to be just for the show and not to sell but that may change now.\u201d\n\n\u201cArt\u2019s Job is to wring emotion out,\u201d concludes their statement. \u201cWhat we do with it after is subjective and on us.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
