When he reaches maturity, he will be an important player for Barca and for France,' Vidal told L'Equipe.\n\n'But, clearly, he has to mature, listen to his body and be better prepared to avoid injuries. If you want to be the best, you should get up, eat and go to bed thinking about football.\n\n'I think Ousmane will realize at some point that he has to do more.'\n\nDembele has featured in just three of Barca's eight La Liga matches this season -struck again by injury. He had an eventful return before the international break, scoring and seeing red for dissent in a 4-0 win over Sevilla.\n\nDembele scored on his return to action against Sevilla, before being sent-off in the 4-0 win\n\nDembele has played in three of Barca's first eight games, struggling with a hamstring injury\n\nHe will miss the next two matches with suspension: yet another disruption to his career so far in Spain. At 22 Dembele has time on his side, and will benefit from mixing with highly experienced players such as Vidal.\n\n'I talk to him a lot. He is a good boy and he is the first to want to be the best. He arrived at Bar\u00e7a at age 20, without much experience,' the former Juventus midfielder continued.\n\n'Ousmane must become aware of what he really wants in life, know where he plays and who he plays with. But I think I see an evolution. It must continue like this.'", "description": "Arturo Vidal has challenged misfiring Barcelona team-mate Ousmane Dembele to step-up his professionalism - with the \u20ac105m winger falling far short of the hype.", "authors": ["Tomiles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19922004-0-image-a-41_1571488464342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
