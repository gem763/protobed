You\u2019d have to do an overall refurb on this place, but I\u2019m not surprised, it is what I expected it to be.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve just gone from the match table to a squash court to a toilet, where the player\u2019s office is, to outside the building, in the rain, to get round here to do interviews, so I\u2019ll probably end up with a bit of pneumonia on top of the cold which I\u2019ve already got. It\u2019s not ideal.\u2019\n\nThe English Open is O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s first tournament in the UK since the World Championship when he crashed out in the first round to James Cahill.\n\nHe has avoided too much international travel in recent years on the circuit, but this looks likely to change as he remains unimpressed with the venues on home shores compared to those in China.\n\n\u2018This is why I\u2019m playing more China events next,\u2019 said Ronnie. \u2018They have good venues, proper tournaments, over here they\u2019re struggling for cash, I think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Over in China they\u2019ve got much more resources financially, they can put a better event on. I don\u2019t really want to have to go through qualifying, but I suppose I\u2019ll have to if I want to play in quality tournaments.\n\n\u2018These are okay, best of seven, bit of fun, get your cueing arm going, but they aren\u2019t the greatest of events really, they\u2019re alright.\u2019\n\nO\u2019Sullivan is back in action on Wednesday against either Yuan Sijun or Igor Figuieredo.\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan says he could still have 15 years left at the top of snooker\n\nMORE: Snooker\u2019s English Open returns to Crawley in defiance of Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s \u2018hellhole\u2019 comments", "description": "Ronnie O'Sullivan's opinion of Crawley has not improved over the last year as he slams the town and the venue for the English Open again.
