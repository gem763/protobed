Jones (25-1 MMA, 19-1 UFC) made sure to point that out (via Instagram):\n\nBefore you guys come to my weight class and start talking shit, make sure you can get past a few of my contenders first \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe #welcome\n\nThe downside of the likes of Weidman and Rockhold moving up to light heavyweight with poor results is that it takes notable fights off the table for Jones.
