Last weekend, Daryl Morey, the general manager of Houston Rockets tweeted an image that read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Even as Morey\u2019s tweet was deleted, the NBA's preseason games in China - intended as a simple celebration of the nation\u2019s basketball interest - morphed into a tale of politics and commercialisation colliding.\n\nMorey may have written the most expensive tweet in history. Several leading Chinese companies have already announced they are suspending partnerships with the league. CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, stopped broadcasting all preseason games. It is still unclear when CCTV will start broadcasting NBA games again.\n\nIn a narrow sense, this is a crisis for one league in one country. But it is also something more: a snapshot of the tightrope that all sports are constantly straddling as they balance the yearning to expand with questions over the price of such expansion, and a reminder that pleasing supporters in one part of the globe now often risks antagonising those in another.\n\nIn a world in which sports stars have been attacked for being silent on a myriad of issues, the NBA has revelled in being an antidote. From the coach Steve Kerr speaking up for refugees, to numerous stars speaking out against Donald Trump and in favour of gun control, social activism and sport have been entangled in the NBA in recent years. This has extended to the very top of the league: in 2014, an NBA owner was banned for life after recordings of him making racist comments were made public. \"Our values are very much part of why people are attracted to us,\u201d Adam Silver, the head of the league, told me last year. \u201cThose values of diversity, inclusion and equality resonate not just in the United States, but globally.\u201d", "description": "Like many geopolitical storms, this one began with a tweet.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/basketball/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212498257-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
