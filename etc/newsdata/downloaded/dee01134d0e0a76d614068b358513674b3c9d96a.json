Then, it\u2019s the Washington Nationals at the Los Angeles Dodgers beginning at 8:37 p.m. The winners meet in the best-of-seven NL Championship Series starting Friday.\n\nARMS RACE\n\nA star-studded series loaded with outstanding pitchers comes to a dramatic conclusion at Dodger Stadium. Stephen Strasburg starts for the wild-card Washington Nationals against Los Angeles right-hander Walker Buehler.\n\nThe league-best Dodgers were 59-22 at home during the regular season, when they drew more than 3 million fans.\n\n\u201cVery confident we\u2019re going to come out of this and move on,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers are trying to reach the NLCS for the fourth consecutive year, while the Nationals have never won a playoff series since the franchise moved from Montreal to Washington in 2005. They\u2019ve been eliminated from the NLDS four times over the past eight years and are 0-3 in Game 5s - all at home.\n\nEach starter already had a fantastic outing to earn a win in the series: Buehler gave up one hit while tossing six scoreless innings in Game 1; Strasburg struck out 10 and allowed one run over six innings in Game 2.\n\nThat dropped Strasburg\u2019s postseason ERA to 0.64, the lowest for anyone with at least four career starts.\n\nAnother thing to keep an eye on: The Dodgers will have three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw available in relief on full rest. Three years ago, when LA eliminated Washington in the NLDS, Kershaw came out of the bullpen in Game 5 to earn the first save of his career.\n\nHAUNTED HISTORY\n\nThe other NL Division Series gets settled in Atlanta - not necessarily a good omen for the home team. Over the years, the city has been the place where opponents come to celebrate in October, and St. Louis certainly hopes to continue that trend.\n\nAtlanta has lost nine straight postseason rounds starting with a five-game setback to Arizona in the 2001 NLCS. The Braves are one series loss from equaling an ignominious record set by the Chicago Cubs, who dropped 10 postseason rounds in a row between 1908 and 2003.\n\n\u201cHistory is history. We\u2019re in the moment now. This is a completely different and new team,\u201d Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson said with a shrug.\n\nThe pitching matchup will be a rematch of Game 2, when Atlanta\u2019s Mike Foltynewicz outdueled Jack Flaherty of the Cardinals for a 3-0 victory.\n\nNine visiting teams eliminated the Braves at their previous ballpark, Turner Field - with the Cardinals doing it twice. The move to SunTrust Park in 2017 didn\u2019t change Atlanta\u2019s fortunes. Last season, the Braves were closed out at home by the Dodgers in Game 4 of the NLDS.\n\nNOT DONE YET\n\nThe Rays and Astros prepare for a win-or-go-home Game 5 in their AL Division Series on Thursday night at Houston. Tampa Bay avoided elimination again Tuesday with its second victory in two days over one of baseball\u2019s best pitchers, beating Justin Verlander and the Astros 4-1.\n\nHouston star Gerrit Cole is scheduled to pitch Game 5 for the heavily favored AL West champs, who led the majors with 107 wins this season and have one more chance to close out the wild-card Rays. Tyler Glasnow is expected to start for Tampa Bay, and the winner plays the New York Yankees in the AL Championship Series.\n\n\u201cEven after going up two games against this ballclub, I don\u2019t think we took anything for granted,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cAt least I know I didn\u2019t. We know how talented these guys were and are. We knew it would be a battle.\u201d\n\nHOPING FOR A CHANCE\n\nInjured center fielder Aaron Hicks feels he\u2019s ready to return to the Yankees\u2019 roster for the AL Championship Series. Hicks, who has a right elbow flexor strain and last played on Aug. 3, is among a group of players at the team\u2019s complex in Florida who were not on the Division Series roster.\n\nHicks said Tuesday he is \u201cdefinitely ready to go out there and play.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s really what I\u2019m getting ready for is to get back and play in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nNew York, which completed a three-game sweep of Minnesota on Monday night, will face Houston or Tampa Bay in Game 1 of the ALCS on Saturday.\n\nHicks is facing live pitching and throwing to bases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty much doing everything,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to Hicks, other New York players working out include outfielder Clint Frazier, first baseman Mike Ford, and pitchers Jordan Montgomery and Stephan Tarpley.\n\n\u201cI think all of us are ready to help if called upon,\u201d Frazier said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Wednesday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/nlds_nationals_dodgers_baseball_93701_c0-122-2914-1821_s1770x1032.jpg?ed0f5cc53783c892ae145d4aaad9cdf6b45adf52", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
