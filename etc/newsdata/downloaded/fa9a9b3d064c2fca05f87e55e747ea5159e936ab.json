Police fired tear gas to clear protesters in the densely populated Mongkok region of the Kowloon peninsula.\n\nThousands of students gathered earlier on the hilltop campus of Chinese University under leaden skies, taking turns to make speeches from a stage with a black backdrop embossed with \u201cStudents in Unity Boycott for our City\u201d.\n\nThey are seeking greater democracy for the former British colony which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees wide-ranging autonomy, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary.\n\nThey fear those freedoms are being slowly eroded by Communist Party rulers in Beijing, a charge China denies.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong police fire tear gas to try to clear protesters\n\n\u201cI come here just to tell others that even after summer holidays end we are not back to our normal life, we should continue to fight for Hong Kong,\u201d said one 19-year-old student who asked to be identified as just Chan.\n\nOn the first day of the new school year, secondary students were seen singing, chanting and forming human chains, some wearing hard hats and masks.\n\nChina accuses Western countries of egging on the protests. It says Hong Kong is its own internal affair.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated Beijing\u2019s support for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s central government supports chief executive Carrie Lam\u2019s leadership ... to administer in accordance with the law and supports Hong Kong\u2019s police tackling the violence and chaos in accordance with the law to restore order,\u201d he told a press briefing.\n\nAs for Lam, she said last week she had caused \u201cunforgivable havoc\u201d by igniting the crisis and would quit if she had a choice.\n\nPeople take part in a general strike at Tamar Park in front of the government buildings in Hong Kong, China September 2, 2019.

People are more mad now,\u201d said Summer, a 20-year-old student who gave only his first name.\n\nThe vice-chairman of the Demosisto pro-democracy movement, Isaac Cheng, was assaulted by three unidentified men on Monday and taken to hospital, the group said in a statement. The group\u2019s leader, Joshua Wong, was one of the prominent leaders of the 2014 struggle.\n\nThousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday. Some then targeted the MTR subway station in nearby Tung Chung, ripping out turnstiles and smashing CCTV cameras, glass panels and lamps with metal poles. Police made several arrests.\n\nLam, a lightning rod for protesters\u2019 anger, said on her Facebook page on Monday that 10 subway stations had been damaged by \u201cviolent offenders\u201d over the weekend.\n\nJohn Lee, government secretary for security, told media that nearly 100 petrol bombs were thrown in various locations on Saturday with two found on a 13-year-old boy who was arrested inside an MTR station.\n\nThe unrest began over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the party.\n\nSlideshow (28 Images)\n\nThe turmoil has evolved into calls for democracy. China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1.\n\nWith Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, China has also warned of the damage the protests are causing to the economy.", "description": "Thousands of Hong Kong university and school students boycotted class and rallied peacefully for democracy on Monday, the latest acts of defiance in an anti-government movement that has plunged the Chinese-ruled city into crisis.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425363755&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810T6"}
