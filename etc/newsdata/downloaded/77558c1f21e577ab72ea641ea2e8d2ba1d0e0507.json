And yet more were only seen between 15 and 21 days.\n\nThat meant a total of 55 MILLION GP visits took longer than a fortnight.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Maskot)\n\nA \u00a32million scheme to bring in an extra 2,000 GPs from abroad has so far produced just 350 candidates \u2013 with only 58 actually in place as of June.\n\nThe shock figures emerged as support grows for the Sunday Mirror campaign End The GP Crisis. We told last week how Britain is veering towards a 7,000 GP shortage within five years because of problems with training and retention.\n\nDr Richard Vautrey, chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s GP committee, said the future of the NHS was hanging in the balance amid a \u201cchronic lack of resources\u201d.\n\nHe warned: \u201cIf doctors are tired, the risk of making a mistake increases and, bit by bit, the risk to patient safety becomes all the more real.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t just a bad day at the office \u2013 for growing numbers of GPs it\u2019s every day and patients suffer as a result.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Science Photo Libra)\n\nLiberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said: \u201cThe shortage of GPs is leaving patients stranded when they could have serious health issues.\n\n\u201cOur GP service is at breaking point due to the lack of funding and the failure by government to solve the problems with recruitment and retention.\u201d\n\nThe Mirror campaign calls on the Government to ease the burden on doctors\u2019 surgeries savaged by Tory cuts.\n\nOur demands include funding for at least 5,000 trainee GPs a year to replace 1,600 places axed by the Tories; nearly 30 million extra appointments to shrink growing surgery waiting times; and improved working conditions to halt a flood of GPs leaving the NHS.\n\nEchoing our calls, Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cGPs and our teams will see well over a million patients every day. But whilst we are working ever harder to deliver care to patients, the number of GPs is falling.\u201d\n\nSouth London GP Louise Irvine, who stood for the NHS Action Party at the last election, sees the problem at first hand.\n\nShe said: \u201cGPs do all they can to see the sickest patients as soon as possible. It\u2019s a real struggle and we feel enormous pressure. GP numbers have stood still since 2010, while patient numbers have risen.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\n\u201cOur practice wanted to employ two more GPs recently but we didn\u2019t have the money. Putting money into extra consultants at the expense of GPs was not a good idea because if patients can\u2019t see a GP, they go to A&E.\u201d\n\nUK patients made 309 appointments in the year to August.\n\nDr Ron Singer \u2013 a GP for 30 years in Edmonton, North London, and member of the Socialist Medical Association \u2013 warned: \u201cThe wheels are coming off general practice. Younger doctors don\u2019t want to be GPs any more. It\u2019s mentally and physically straining. List sizes are going up.\n\n\u201cSo even if practices merge, it is just a cosmetic exercise. We still don\u2019t have enough GPs. Unless you sort out the mess in general practice and give patients easy GP access, the pressure on A&E will never be relieved.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \u201cTwo in three appointments happen within seven days of being booked, but we are determined to reduce GP waiting times further.\n\n\"Through our NHS Long Term Plan we are investing an extra \u00a34.5billion a year by 2023-24 into primary and community care, including funding up to 20,000 extra staff in GP practices \u2013 helping to free-up doctors to spend more time with patients.\u201d\n\nFrustration is shared by surgeries\n\nComment - by Prof Helen Stokes Lampard\n\nPatients are frustrated at waiting too long for a GP appointment \u2013 and it\u2019s extremely frustrating for GPs and our teams, as well.\n\nIn the main, patients understand the pressures we are under and that the reason they can\u2019t secure a routine appointment as soon as they\u2019d like, isn\u2019t through lack of trying on our part.\n\nAs a profession we are offering more consultations than ever. We have had promises of more funding, so things are looking up \u2013 but these need to be delivered if the situation on the ground is going to get better.\n\nIn the meantime, patients can help ease pressures with the \u201c3 before GP\u201d mantra.\n\nBefore calling, particularly for minor ailments, ask yourself: Can I self-care? Can I use NHS.uk or a similar, UK-based reputable website for health advice? Can I seek advice or treatment from a pharmacist?\n\nAnd with winter coming, it\u2019s wise to get your flu jab.\n\nCollapsing under our workloads\n\nComment - by Dr Richard Vautrey, GP Committee Chair at the BMA\n\nI love my job, but at times it can feel like working in a pressure cooker.\n\nI want to give my patients in Leeds the time they need, but a 10-minute appointment is often totally inadequate \u2013 and GPs are collapsing under their workloads.\n\nGPs have to find time for consultations, dealing with test results, checking prescriptions and reviewing clinic letters. If this overruns, waiting lists get longer, we often find ourselves too busy to look after our own wellbeing and it becomes harder to give patients the high-quality care they need.\n\nThe BMA is working hard to raise awareness of these pressures \u2013 just this week we launched a Mental Wellbeing Charter for doctors \u2013 but we need the Government to help us make real changes.\n\nWe need more staff to triage and work alongside us and better premises and technology that helps to support care \u2013 all of which would help free-up precious time with our patients.\n\n", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Shortage of 7,000 docs over five years means waiting times to see GPs have hit a new high, the Sunday Mirror can reveal", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Getty Images Maskot", "Getty Images Science Photo Libra", "Getty Images Eyeem", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567090.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Doctor-giving-medical-advice-to-patient.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
