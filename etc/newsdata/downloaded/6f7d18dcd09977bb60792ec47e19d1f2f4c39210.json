Ignoring the reviews, I bought it anyway and was disgusted at not only how broken it was but the use of microtransactions, the terrible story, and how it was worse than Ghost Recon Wildlands and didn\u2019t add a single thing that was better.\n\nActivision and EA are constantly criticised for their actions, and rightly so, but for me Ubisoft are just as bad. All three are horrible, just in different ways. Activision are really underhanded, sneaking in microtransactions after launch and restricting reviews, but in their defence do often put out good games. EA don\u2019t even pretend to care about the quality of their games and treat their developers terribly, while refusing to listen to anybody about microtransactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUbisoft though, they have thousands of people making each of their games and then are surprised when they turn out to be really bland and lacking in focus. They\u2019re also really creepy when it comes to encouraging right wing gun nuts in their Tom Clancy games. And despite being raked over the coals for it, for the last five years or more, their testing is absolute terrible, with more bugs and glitches than a Bethesda game.\n\nObviously, I do like some of their game \u2013 I liked Wildands \u2013 and I like some from Activision too, but Ubisoft\u2019s games are becoming so similar now it\u2019s becoming hard to tell the difference. Breakpoint is a hodgepodge of ideas from all their previous games, where you can tell they just thought, \u2018Well, these other games are popular, let\u2019s mash them all together and call it a new game!\u2019\n\nThey deserve to be punished in terms of sales and I\u2019m glad The Division 2 did badly too, because that always seemed a stupid idea that was released too close to the last one. The thing that gets me is that anyone could\u2019ve told them that was a problem. Literally any gamer they asked. And yet they spent three years, or whatever, making it, marketing it, and releasing it and then acted surprised when it failed for such an obvious reason.\n\nThey say in their financial report that it came out too soon and you can\u2019t have too many games as a service titles on the go like that. But how come they never realised that beforehand? Do they think people have infinite time? How many of these games do they expect anyone to have on the go at once?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll tell you why they did it though and it\u2019s simple: greed and laziness. People have put up with it this long, why would they stop? Same with Breakpoint. You can almost picture the execs saying, \u2018Gamers put up with our last few games being full of bugs, they probably will this time too\u2019.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know why Breakpoint was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back but I\u2019m glad it did. And now they\u2019re delaying Watch Dogs Legion and Rainbow Six Quarantine, to make sure they don\u2019t suffer the same problem. Implying they were going to if this hadn\u2019t happened, and they were happy to release them that way too \u2013 until suddenly their bottom line got hit.\n\nThe reader the other week was right, video game companies do treat us like idiots. And too often with good cause. Well, I\u2019m not buying a single new Ubisoft game until they show some sign they\u2019ve learned their lesson, and for more than just one game. Wasn\u2019t Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity bad enough? Why didn\u2019t that instil in them a burning desire to never release such a buggy game again?\n\nAnd if Activision do sneak in microtransaction into Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare a couple of months after release they can take a running jump too. I\u2019d say the same for EA but I\u2019m already avoiding them and haven\u2019t bought a game of theirs in years. More people need to make a similar stand because, as we see with Breakpoint being a flop, as soon as money is at stake suddenly publishers are all ears to problem everyone else has known about for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy reader Zebra\n\nThe reader\u2019s feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.
