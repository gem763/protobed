Hundreds of those are believed to have been killed.\n\nMeanwhile, illegal shipments of the so-called 'Jihadi drug' Captagon worth a total of almost \u00a31.5m have been intercepted in France for the first time.\n\nThe euphoria-generating drug is increasingly used by ISIS terrorists as they set off on their murderous missions\n\nIt comes as the euphoria-generating drug is increasingly used by ISIS terrorists as they set off on their murderous missions.\n\nDetails of the customs haul at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport were today made public for the first time.\n\nSome 350,000 tablets of the amphetamine-based Captagon were first found at France's busiest airport on January 4.\n\nThen, on February 22, another 300,000 were found - making a total of 135kgs of Captagon with a street value of \u00a31.4million.\n\nIn both cases, the drugs were hidden within industrial steel moldings destined for Saudi Arabia, via the Czech Republic, and Turkey.\n\nDetails of the customs haul at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport were today made public for the first time\n\nThe shipment originated in Lebanon, said a customs official, adding: 'This is the first time that this drug has been seized in France.'\n\nThere have been similar seizures in other European countries this year, including Holland, where the country's first known fake Captagon laboratory was found in April.\n\nHundreds of thousands of the pillswere discovered, along with three guns, in the premises in the town ofBrunssum, and there were two arrests.\n\nCaptagon, which was invented to treat sleep disorders, keeps users awake for long periods of time, and can make them feel hugely energetic and happy.\n\nISIS terrorists have often spoken about taking the addictive hallucinogenic pills - hence the 'Jihadi drug' tag.\n\nIt has become particularly associated with the war in Syria, where thousands of fighters take the drug before entering battlefields.\n\nWhile Captagon is a brand name for the fenethylline drug, there are also plenty of fake versions stamped with the word 'Captagon' to increase their street value.\n\nThe biggest legal consumer of Captagon is Saudi Arabia, where there is also a highly lucrative cocaine market.\n\nThe seizure in France comes as the country remains under a State of Emergency following a series of ISIS attacks across Europe.", "description": "Special forces in France are reportedly supplying Iraqi soldiers with names and photos of up to 30 French citizens who have fled to Iraq.", "authors": ["Julian Robinson", "Peter Allen In Paris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/30/16/40EFD53100000578-0-image-a-86_1496156594464.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-30"}
