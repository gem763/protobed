Myeni also failed to appear before the court on Monday.\n\nMantsha had stopped representing Myeni on September 30. On Tuesday he said his appearance was \u201cout of courtesy for the court\u201d and he was not acting under instruction from Myeni.\n\nMyeni led the national flag carrier's board between December 2012 and October 2017. During this period the airline faced financial instability, growing debt and operational challenges.\n\nThe Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and SAA Pilots Association want the court to declare her a delinquent director, based on her leadership during the period. If the court rules in favour of the application, she will no longer able to act as a company director.\n\nAdvocate Carol Steinberg, legal counsel for the applicants, stated that one of the reasons given by Myeni for her inability to afford legal services was that she had been waiting for a liability insurance claim for SAA directors to cover the costs. It later emerged that the claim was only lodged last week Friday. Other reasons for her no-show include that she is not in a position to pay for petrol or accommodation to allow her to travel from her current home in KwaZulu-Natal to attend the case.\n\nMyeni, who sits on the boards of 13 companies according to information presented in court, has claimed she is unable to secure legal representation because she is unemployed.\n\nMantsha told the court he had made contact with Myeni who informed him that she has arranged for a legal counsel to bring an application for postponement of the case on Thursday.\n\nTolmay said Myeni is expected to file a \u201csubstantive\u201d application for postponement by close of business on Wednesday, warning that the case has been dragging for far too long.\n\nMyeni who was seen as a close ally of former president Jacob Zuma, has denied allegations linking her to poor governance at SAA.\n\nThe matter will resume on Thursday for the application for postponement.", "description": "The former SAA board chair again failed to appear in court in Pretoria in a delinquency case.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6060/b1f7133d4870410bb1bc45578b8c6522.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
