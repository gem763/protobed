She is smart with a head for policy and a record of reaching across the aisle. But her campaign has been sleepy from the start, and it is hard to imagine her campaign suddenly catching new energy.\n\nBooker ranked in the top tier of performers in the last debate, and he is likable. But despite his best quarterly fundraising haul to date in the third quarter, his campaign seems stalled. Maybe he could find some energy in the vacuum created by a Biden collapse.\n\nButtigieg raised more than $19 million in the third quarter \u2014 $6 million shy of what he reached in the previous quarter, but nothing to shake a stick at. Buttigieg is one of the most effective fundraisers in the race. Still, everyone says \u201cI really like him, but \u2026\u201d and then proceeds to something along the lines of \u201cthis just isn\u2019t his year\u201d or \u201che would make a great secretary of \u2026\u201d \u2014 which is what they said about Biden for much of his career.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ed Rogers", "Journalnow.Com Opinion Columnists Ed-Rogers-Who-Benefits-From-A-Biden-Collapse"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
