William McRaven said China\u2019s growing technological capabilities should be a \u201choly s\u2014 moment\u201d for the US.\n\nBut technological prowess is only one part of military dominance, and there are other areas where China is lacking.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s home page for more stories.\n\nChina\u2019s intellectual property theft of both civil and military information is no secret.\n\nFrom alleged attempts to hack into Swedish telecom provider Ericsson to the theft of information related to the F-22 and F-35, there are several instances of China gaining access to foreign technology or trying to do so.\n\nThere are also examples of Chinese military systems looking suspiciously like US systems \u2013 the F-22 and the MQ-9 Reaper drone among them. Other elements of those Chinese systems \u2013 the software, technology, and manpower used to operate them \u2013 aren\u2019t on par with the US military yet.\n\nBut they might not be far behind, according to Defense Secretary Mark Esper. At the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s National Cybersecurity Summit on Thursday, he warned that China is perpetrating \u201cthe greatest intellectual property theft in human history.\u201d\n\nEsper told attendees that he had cautioned European allies against allowing Chinese companies to build 5G cyber networks in their countries, warning that to do so would risk sensitive national security information.\n\n\u201cEvery Chinese company has the potential to be an accomplice in Beijing\u2019s state-sponsored campaign to steal technology,\u201d he said, highlighting China\u2019s integration of civil and military technology, an area in which Beijing surpasses the US.\n\n\u201cChina has systematically sought to acquire US technology both through traditional espionage means, as well as through legal investments in companies,\u201d Daniel Kliman, director of the the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, told Insider.\n\n\u201cThe United States very much still retains a military technological edge, but it\u2019s clear that edge is eroding,\u201d Kliman said.\n\nRead on to see how China\u2019s carbon copies stack up to US weapons systems.\n\nThe PLA\u2019s J-20 looks extremely similar to the US Air Force\u2019s F-22 Raptor.\n\ncaption Chinese air force J-20 stealth fighters perform with open weapon bays at the Zhuhai Airshow in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, November 11, 2018. source REUTERS/Stringer\n\nAs Popular Mechanics reports, the Chengdu J-20 is one of the aircraft that was designed using information from the US.\n\nSu Bin, a Chinese national and aerospace entrepreneur, pleaded guilty to cyber espionage in 2016. He and coconspirators spied on US plans for the C-17 Globemaster, the F-35, and the F-22.\n\nBut while the J-20 looks like the F-22, it\u2019s not quite in the same league.\n\nMichael Kofman, a senior research analyst at the CNA think tank, told Insider last year that he suspected \u201cthe J-20 probably has great avionics and software but, as always, has terrible engine design. In fact, Chinese low-observation aircraft designs like J-31 are flying on older Russian Klimov engines because the Chinese can\u2019t make an engine.\u201d\n\nKofman also expressed doubt about the J-20\u2019s stealth capability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got so many surfaces, and a lot of them look pretty reflective from the sides too. I\u2019m pretty skeptical of the stealth on that aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chinese Shenyang J-31 is strikingly similar to the US F-35.\n\ncaption A Chinese Shenyang J-31. source REUTERS/Alex Lee , REUTERS/U.S. Air Force photo/Randy Gon/Handout\n\nThe Shenyang J-31 is still under development but will likely replace the J-15 fighter, at least on aircraft carriers. The J-15 has been plagued with issues, including multiple fatal crashes and problems with its engine, the South China Morning Post reported last year.\n\nThe J-31 is the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s second stealth aircraft and was first seen in 2014. There is widespread speculation that the J-31 is based on Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 plans, although China has denied those claims.\n\nThe J-31 is lighter and has a shorter range than the F-35 but may beat it with maximum speed of Mach 1.8 to the F-35\u2019s Mach 1.6, Popular Science reported in 2017.\n\nThe question of how well these aircraft actually match up to their US competitors remains, and, Kliman said, appearances are only part of the equation.\n\n\u201cSometimes superficially the designs do look similar \u2013 it could be, in part, from some of the attempts China\u2019s made to acquire good technology, but I would just caution that at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to know how similar it is or not,\u201d he told Insider.\n\nThe Caihong-class unmanned aerial vehicle, including the CH-4 and CH-5, look unmistakably like US MQ-9 Reaper drones.\n\ncaption An MQ-Reaper over Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, June 25, 2015. source Senior Airman Cory D. Payne/US Air Force\n\nWhile there\u2019s no concrete evidence that the Chinese design is the result of espionage or theft, the visual similarities are unmistakable \u2013 nose-mounted cameras on the CH-4B, as well as locations for external munitions are just like those on the Reaper, Popular Mechanics reported in 2016, calling the two aircraft \u201cidentical.\u201d\n\nBreaking Defense reported in 2015 that, in addition to the same domed nose and V-shaped tail, the UAVs both have 66-foot wingspans.\n\nDrone designer Shi Wen, of the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics, told China Daily three years ago that the CH-5 model \u201ccan perform whatever operations the MQ-9 Reaper can and is even better than the US vehicle when it comes to flight duration and operational efficiency.\u201d\n\nBut again, Chinese technology and specifications likely don\u2019t match up to US counterparts.\n\nFor starters, the Reaper can carry roughly double the munitions of the CH-5. And while the CH-5 can travel farther, with a range of about 1,200 miles, its flight ceiling is about 23,000 feet, compared to the Reaper\u2019s nearly 50,000-foot ceiling, according to the Center for Strategic International Studies\u2019 China Power project.\n\nThe Reaper also has a heavier maximum takeoff weight and can travel at twice the speed of the CH-5, due to persistent challenges with Chinese-made engines.\n\nThe Chinese air force\u2019s Y-20 transport aircraft has design similarities to the US Air Force\u2019s C-17 Globemaster III.\n\ncaption A model of the Y-20 military transporter aircraft at Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC)\u2019s booth at the Aviation Expo China 2015 in Beijing. source Jason Lee / REUTERS\n\nSu Bin pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiring to steal technical data related to the C-17 from Boeing and the US Air Force.\n\nThat data likely was used to build the Xian Y-20, China\u2019s large transport aircraft, nicknamed the \u201cChubby Girl.\u201d As Garrett M. Graff notes in Wired, Su helped pilfer about 630,000 files related to the C-17.\n\nWhether China used information about the C-17 to build the Y-20 is unclear \u2013 Beijing has denied stealing US technology for its weapons systems \u2013 but the similarities are apparent, from the nose to the tail stabilizer, as Kyle Mizokami points out in Popular Mechanics.\n\nThe Y-20 has a smaller empty weight and payload than the C-17, Popular Mechanics reported in 2016, but the Y-20 is the largest transport aircraft in production. The Chinese military lacked a large transport carrier prior to the development of the Y-20, making it difficult to quickly mobilize large numbers of supplies and troops to battlefields or disaster areas, Wired reported in 2012.\n\n\u201cJust because something looks somewhat similar doesn\u2019t mean it has equivalent capabilities,\u201d Kliman cautioned, particularly where human capability is concerned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the technology alone. It\u2019s the quality of the pilots in a fighter airplane. It\u2019s the quality of the systems that are feeding the aircraft information,\u201d Kilman said.\n\nChina hasn\u2019t fought a foreign war since the brief Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979. US service members and systems have much more battlefield experience than Chinese forces.\n\n\u201cThe [People\u2019s Liberation Army] has made a long-term effort to improve its human capital, including through training but also through education \u2026 but at this point, the US, our pilots, our operators get, certainly, the real-world experience,\u201d Kilman said.\n\nWhere does China go from here?\n\ncaption Chinese soldiers in armored vehicles at Tiananmen Square during a military parade for the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, in Beijing, September 3, 2015 source Reuters\n\nIf Esper and retired Navy Adm. William McRaven are to be believed, China is rapidly closing the technology and defense gap with the US, through both legal and illegal means.\n\nWhether China is pouring money into research and development or committing outright intellectual-property theft, US officials have cause for concern about the future.\n\nIn August, Chinese national Pengyi Li was arrested on his way to Hong Kong after an undercover investigation by the Department of Homeland Security into the smuggling of components for missiles and surveillance satellites from the US to China, Tim Fernholz and Justin Rohrlich reported in Quartz.\n\nChinese nationals have also been found guilty of trying to smuggle accelerometers, which are necessary for guided missiles and spacecraft.\n\nIn terms of hypersonic technology, which \u201cdoes seem pretty game-changing,\u201d China is ahead of the US, said Kliman, who stressed that it\u2019s important not to be alarmist.\n\n\u201cI think those statements are certainly well-intended and grounded in reality,\u201d he said, referring to Esper and McRaven\u2019s warnings.\n\nOutside of military technology, Kliman said, China certainly is a leader in information technology. But when it comes to systems, allies, and people, the US still has a leg up on the competition \u2013 for now.", "description": "Business Insider - At the National Cybersecurity Summit on Thursday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper sounded the alarm over China's growing 5G dominance..
