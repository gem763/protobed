They believe we need to take urgent action to save the planet for future generations. So why do so many chemtrail conspiracy theorists think climate change is a big hoax?\n\nFor weeks, attacks on teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg have been the most popular posts on the most popular Facebook page for the chemtrail conspiracy theory. At nearly 183,000 members, the page is a stronghold for people who believe the government or other agencies are spraying chemicals out of planes for nefarious purposes (perhaps mind control, perhaps weather control, depending on which believer you ask). And as Thunberg and American school children rally for climate action, they\u2019re becoming a favorite target of the conspiracy crowd.\n\nThunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, is the most visible young person demanding environmental action from world leaders. Late last month, she addressed the United Nations in a fiery speech that drew scorn from the right\u2014notably President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump retweeted a post calling the high schooler an \u201cactress\u201d who was \u201cgetting the best education socialism can steal,\u201d but the comments on conspiracy Facebook pages were far more vitriolic. After weeks of photoshops likening Thunberg to Hitler and worse, some members of the largest chemtrail group thought it had gone too far.\n\n\u201cAdmin - if you continue to let people troll Greta on here you\u2019re a gutless swine,\u201d one user, who typically posts chemtrail theories wrote on the page last week. The page\u2019s administrator hit back in a long post accusing Thunberg of being part of a New World Order plot to \u201clead us all to literal slavery.\u201d The Hitler photoshops resumed in the comments section.\n\nDespite their shared interest in the weather, chemtrail believers and climate activists have little common ground. That, according to Peter Ditto, a professor of psychological science studying motivated reasoning at the University of California Irvine, can be chalked up to conservative politics\n\nDitto said climate denialism often functions \u201clike a team sport.\u201d Although there\u2019s no moral argument against accepting climate data, \u201cfor other reasons, probably economic, the Republican party and conservative thinkers have decided they don\u2019t want to believe [climate change], that it\u2019s threatening to them,\u201d Ditto said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a team, tribal mentality in the United States right now that people just line up and say, \u2018My side doesn\u2019t believe that\u2026 believing that is almost tantamount to treason, or betrayal.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome chemtrail believers incorporate more left-leaning fears, like suspicion of agricultural giant Monsanto, into their thinking. But Facebook groups for the movement show a prevailing and growing alignment with the right. (The chemtrail theory has considerable overlap with the anti-vaccination movement, which has flourished in some liberal enclaves but also has a growing fanbase on the far right.)\n\n\u201cClimate change denialism is a huge feature of conspiracy theories, especially on the right (but not exclusively),\u201d said Anna Merlan, author of Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power. \u201cIt ties in neatly with a suspicion of world governments and \u2018official stories\u2019 and especially distrust of anything that calls for worldwide solutions, like the Paris agreement.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations, where Thunberg spoke last month, is a popular demon in conspiracy circles, especially when it comes to environmental policy. In 1992, the U.N. passed Agenda 21, a nonbinding environmental agreement that found a foe in American right-wing and anti-environmental interests from the start. Members of conspiratorial groups like the John Birch Society suggested the environmental guidelines were actually a U.N. plot to chip away at American independence. Those fears trickled up through the right, bursting into the mainstream in 2012 when conservative pundit Glenn Beck wrote a dystopian novel called Agenda 21 and the GOP officially adopted a resolution condemning Agenda 21 as \u201cerosive of American sovereignty.\u201d (The chemtrail group admin cited Agenda 21 in his post justifying attacks on Thunberg.)\n\nYoung climate activists stand at an unfortunate meeting point of conspiracy theories. Asking world leaders for climate solutions gets them branded as puppets in a New World Order scheme. And even pointing out the reality of climate change puts them at odds with an evolving set of conspiracy theorists and figures on the right.\n\n\u201cClimate denialism is an older idea that's constantly seeing new updates,\u201d Merlan said. \u201cRush Limbaugh has been shouting about global warming being a lie for years and years, and Alex Jones has been a longtime skeptic too, but I constantly see new conspiracy communities tying into it, like QAnon, since it fits their other political viewpoints.\u201d\n\nAmong those newer conspiracy communities is Natural News, a site that began as a hub for organic food junkies but morphed into an Infowars-on-ketamine conspiracy site over the past decade. Despite the site\u2019s purported love of nature, it regularly denounces climate change as a hoax. (Two of its top headlines on Thursday: \u201cNASA admits that climate change occurs because of changes in Earth\u2019s solar orbit, and NOT because of SUVs and fossil fuels\u201d and \u201cClimate change hoax COLLAPSES as new science finds human activity has virtually zero impact on global temperatures.\u201d)\n\nClimate denial (and lately, anti-Thunberg memes) also crops up among the Flat Earth community, which believes the planet is a flat disc, probably covered by a dome. For some Flat Earthers, climate denial is part of a cohesive worldview that claims most of the world\u2019s ills are actually hoaxes. This set of Flat Earthers claim that the people involved in covering up Earth\u2019s true pizza-like shape are also lying about climate change and the existence of free, unlimited energy. It doesn\u2019t help that climate change is sometimes called \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\n\nLike chemtrail believers, Flat Earthers often take a keen interest in the environment. But they interpret climate data in a way that supports their theory. When news outlets reported about the breakoff of a massive Antarctic ice shelf this week, Flat Earthers eagerly shared the story because its picture of a sheer cliff of ice looks like the ice wall that many Flat Earthers believe surrounds the flat planet.\n\nNot all Flat Earthers believe climate change is a hoax, however. Last July, the Flat Earth Society tweeted that \u201cit would be nothing short of irresponsible to question something with so much overwhelming evidence behind it, and something that threatens us so directly as a species.\u201d\n\nConspiracy theorists aren\u2019t the only ones reluctant to accept data that challenges their beliefs. We\u2019re all guilty of it, to a degree, Ditto said.\n\n\u201cWhen people get information that challenges them, they tend to take it harder. It\u2019s an idea I call motivated skepticism,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are more skeptical of information they want to believe than information they do, so they have harder standards for things that challenge their political beliefs. That\u2019s a very fundamental phenomenon.\u201d\n\nConspiracy theorizing is a different mental process, he said. \u201cPeople look for patterns, see patterns and data that aren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nMerlan noted that conspiracy theories can also act as a balm for people faced with a complicated problem like climate change. \u201cClimate change denialists functionally preach that we all just need to ignore scientists, experts and activists\u2014or maybe accuse them of being globalist tools or brainwashed by a Satanic Cabal\u2014and do absolutely nothing else,\u201d she said.\n\nIn that sense, the attacks on Thunberg mirror last year\u2019s attacks on teenagers who rallied for new gun legislation following a massacre at Parkland, Florida\u2019s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Some conspiracy theorists accused the teenage survivors of being involved in a Deep State plot to seize their guns. Others claimed the shooting never happened at all.\n\n\u201cIt's like false flag conspiracy theories about gun control in that way,\u201d Merlan said of climate denialists, \u201cand like those, it encourages inaction and apathy at the worst possible time for it.\u201d", "description": "They believe humans are affecting the environment\u2014so why are they trolling the 16-year-old climate activist?", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570465280/191007-weill-chemtrails-greta-tease_g99nr3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
