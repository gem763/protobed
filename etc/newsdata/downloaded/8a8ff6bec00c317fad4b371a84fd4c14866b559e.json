The fast-casual chain couldn\u2019t seem to shake off the damage done to its previously strong reputation, financial results and stock-market returns by a rash of outbreaks of food-borne illness nearly 2\u00bd years earlier.\n\nChipotle\u2019s stock dropped from $750 at the close on Oct. 13, 2015, to as low as $251.33 on Feb. 13, 2018, shedding 67% of its value as news that customers had fallen sick from E. coli poisoning began making headlines. As management raced to fix one set of problems, others popped up, including a data breach in March and April 2017 that affected restaurants in five states.\n\nWall Street downgraded the stock as analysts fretted that the company would be unable to win back lost customers.\n\nThey were wrong. This Aug. 29, the stock set a fresh all-time closing high of $843.64, topping a record set two days prior. Chipotle\u2019s stock, in fact, has soared more than 93% in 2019, compared with the S&P 500 index\u2019s SPX, -0.49% 20% gain.\n\nGetty Images CEO Brian Niccol.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to Chipotle, the company had tons of ideas \u2014 an almost crippling [number],\u201d Niccol told MarketWatch. But now \u201cI think we\u2019re focused on the right strategies, execution is getting better, the response has exceeded expectations \u2014 I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen the response from the financial markets.\u201d\n\nThe turnaround at Chipotle extends to most of the business, including \u2014 importantly \u2014 the food. The company introduced a limited-time carne asada menu item this week that SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said \u201ccould be a meaningful traffic and check driver.\u201d\n\nSee: Chipotle\u2019s new menu items are key to its comeback story\n\nCMG, +0.31% You might say Chipotle has gone from making its customers retch to, once again, making its shareholders rich.\n\nThe food is the same \u2026 sort of\n\nThe Chipotle brand has always distinguished itself on issues like sustainability, sound animal husbandry and responsible sourcing.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s changed on the culinary aspect and the \u2018food with integrity\u2019 purpose,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nWell, not quite \u201cnothing.\u201d Chipotle turned its focus to food safety in the months after the illness outbreaks were reported. The company adopted a \u201cstage gate\u201d system that tests, analyzes and gathers feedback about menu ideas to determine what proceeds to a national rollout. So rather than push forward on every idea, the company has instituted a system of improved discipline, Niccol said. \u201cWe\u2019re using the stage-gate process to ask, \u2018Does this idea have merit?\u2019 \u201d\n\nPrior to stage gate, when, for example, queso was added to the menu, Chipotle stumbled. The rollout was rocky, with negative social-media feedback going viral and \u201csurprising\u201d executives.\n\nChipotle Carne asada is available for a limited time.\n\nThe new approach seems to be yielding more successes for a company that, while it might have freely explored a multitude of ideas, rarely \u2014 as compared with rival counter-service chains and their frequent introductions of seasonal and limited-run items, rarely changed its menu.\n\nOne current limited-time-only offer: carne asada. And Chipotle is already testing other items, with queso blanco getting a limited-time push in three cities this summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they have gone away from that approach towards food, but they have broadened their horizons, in part because they\u2019ve gotten past the food-safety issues,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski, chief executive of Kalinowski Equity Research. \u201cA willingness to have new menu items is a dramatic shift for them culturally. There\u2019s more reason, on this front, to go to Chipotle.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Chipotle is making news with its newer food items.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the news for the wrong reasons a lot less,\u201d said Kalinowski. \u201cSo people can focus on the positive, like [that] the food is tasty and the service is quick.\u201d\n\nAnd: White Claw, Truly and other hard seltzers could take a hit from \u2018Sober September\u2019\n\nMore access, less friction\n\n\u201cIt used to be the only way to access Chipotle was to come in and stand in line,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nNow there are an app and loyalty program and delivery, which gets orders to customers in an average of 28 minutes. Customers can order through the Chipotle app and then bypass the line to pick up their meals.\n\n\u201cWe thought initially the app would be something more for heavy users,\u201d Niccol said. But it\u2019s also been a plus for new customers, who may grow anxious from the pressure of making ordering decisions and then selecting from among the add-on options with a line of customers waiting behind them.\n\n\u201cThey have a great experience, and we find they become a repeat customer,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nInvestors, who may have been anxious about Chipotle in the recent past, can take comfort in the company\u2019s digital business, with sales growing 99% in the second quarter, accounting for 18.2% of total sales for the period. Chipotle revenue in the second quarter came to $1.4 billion.\n\n\u201cChipotle\u2019s digital ecosystem \u2014 which includes mobile order and pay loyalty [promotions] and digital delivery \u2014 has rapidly become the engine behind its impressive comeback story,\u201d wrote KeyBanc Capital Markets in a July note.\n\nRead: Why some restaurants are turning up their noses at Beyond Meat\n\nChipotle Chipotle is still focused on food but attributes its turnaround to factors outside of the menu.\n\nLizzy Freier, managing editor at Technomic, a data and analytics provider for the food-service industry, said digital is \u201cthe biggest thing driving Chipotle\u2019s turnaround,\u201d and these initiatives are key to bringing in millennial and Gen Z customers.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while for any chain to come back from widespread reports of food-borne illness,\u201d Freier said. \u201cI think the fact that Chipotle changed its whole marketing strategy recently really helped bring it out of its rut. It used to focus on local marketing, but has shifted this past year to national ads to make Chipotle and its branding message more visible to customers.\u201d\n\nNiccol, who was the CEO of Yum Brands Inc. YUM, -1.58% chain Taco Bell before joining Chipotle, also highlighted Chipotle\u2019s marketing: \u201cYou see it in the advertising,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason why Chipotle exists is to give people a true culinary experience really fast in an affordable way.\u201d\n\nChipotle became a smooth operator\n\nOperations are where it all begins for Niccol. He said the company has a well-trained team that\u2019s executing consistently and getting better over time.\n\n\u201cAs digital grows and presents new operational challenges, we expect the company can pivot their store image and design to better emphasize and facilitate this fast-growing channel,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs analysts led by Katherine Fogertey in a June note in which the Goldman team initiated coverage of the restaurant sector. The analysts added Chipotle to their \u201cconviction list,\u201d rating the stock a buy with a $1,000 price target.\n\nRead: Wendy\u2019s making a $20 million bet on breakfast and analysts are skeptical\n\n\u201cBeyond just improving operations and experience for pickup and delivery orders (while also maintaining a strong dine-in experience), we see opportunities for kiosks and expanded Chipotlanes [drive-through lanes] to help drive digital mix. We have confidence in the management team to implement such changes, and look forward to more announcements that will unlock sales opportunities that can have a powerful impact on traffic and customer service.\u201d\n\nThe turnaround goes beyond dollars and cents\n\nThe opportunities ahead are based on the company as a whole rather than one aspect of the business, according to Josh Ginsberg, chief executive of Zignal Labs, a media analytics and intelligence platform.\n\n\u201cThey really aren\u2019t associated with food safety and E. coli issues anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe food is a piece of the overall experience but not necessarily the No. 1 thing they\u2019re highlighting. They\u2019re taking a holistic approach that\u2019s positive for their business.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Chicken sandwich wars: Popeyes, Chick-fil-A and Wendy\u2019s are waging an all-out food fight on Twitter\n\nWhen Jack Hartung, Chipotle\u2019s chief financial officer, talks about the turnaround, he looks beyond the revenue, profit and stock price. \u201cWe know the market is fickle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t celebrate too hard with the stock goes up, and we don\u2019t get too down when the stock goes down. We know the stock will take care of itself.\u201d\n\nFrom his perspective, Chipotle is willing to invest in its food mantra, with pricey ingredients like fresh avocados simply a cost of doing business. The comeback rests on what makes it unique and creates better relationships with customers.\n\nNearly four years on, the turnaround continues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the early innings,\u201d said Hartung, \u201cand while we\u2019re off to a great start we think we can do a lot more.\u201d", "description": "Chipotle\u2019s stock tanked after a serious of illness outbreaks and other challenges.
