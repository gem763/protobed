His weekly business videos at Section4 and Winners & Losers have generated millions of views.\n\nThe following is his recent blog post in full, republished by permission. It originally ran on his own blog,\"No Mercy / No Malice.\"\n\nIn it, he argues that Softbank is linked to several real estate unicorns, and some of them \u2014 like OYO and WeWork \u2014 are on a precarious path.\n\nHe says that the bigger picture, though, is that an \"epidemic of hubris\" fueled the \"Unicorn Industrial Complex,\" but that an antidote is on its way.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1: SoftBank and real estate\n\nLast night I met up with friends at Soho House, a members-only club. I've always wanted to be a member, and have several friends who've offered to sponsor me. But the thought of being rejected for membership by a club where all my friends are members is damage my ego couldn't endure. So, no membership for the dawg. As a guest, I'll have a nice meal and a couple Maker's and Gingers (i.e., five). I'll then go home and decide the smart thing to do would be a preemptive strike against my member-like hangover, so I'll ingest 32 ounces of water, 3 Advil, and a hit of my dosist sleep vape. I'll then watch the last 2 episodes of Succession and get 4-5 hours of sleep.\n\nThursday. Night. In. NYC.\n\nI'm going on Barron's TV (yep, that's a thing) Friday morning to discuss Tesla (which I believe is overvalued), Amazon, and Apple. As I don't rave about the stock, on the subway back I'll learn via Twitter (where technology meets hate) that I'm an idiot, not a real professor, and hard to look at, from handles that are some version of @Teslalong. I'm fairly certain there are more fake Twitter handles managed by Tesla longs than the GRU.\n\nNote: If it sounds strange that I'll be going on TV possibly still drunk, keep in mind the show is broadcast on Fox. Most of their anchors seem high when they broadcast.\n\nScott Galloway Courtesy of Scott Galloway\n\nI'll also avoid making any important decisions Friday. When I have a member/guest hangover, my judgment is impaired. This poor judgment is predictable and can be reverse-engineered to a pattern: alcohol, marijuana, lack of sleep. So, where else could we apply pattern recognition to predict what might happen in the markets?\n\nI know, let's talk about WeWork.\n\nThe pattern of tectonic plates grinding: SoftBank, real estate, red flags. Where else can we discern the kind of plate collision that leads to an earthquake? (Note: especially proud of the seismology metaphor in the previous sentence.) Btw, best movie involving a guy who could predict earthquakes? \"Phenomenon.\"\n\nWhat earthquakes are to California, SoftBank is to real estate unicorns:\n\nCompass\n\nBusiness model\n\nUse technology to pair top brokers with home buyers\n\nYogababble\n\n\"To help everyone find their place in the world.\"\n\nFunding\n\nDifferentiation\n\nProprietary technology and 19% of non-broker employees work in \"technology\"\n\nHighest Glassdoor rating (4.3) for real estate companies\n\nHas acquired 14 other brokerages\n\nFeces (red flags)\n\nYogababble\n\nC-Suite turnover is a sh*tshow: includes the CFO, COO, CMO, CTO, CPO, General Counsel, Head of Product, VP of Product, and VP of Communications\n\nCapital masking as growth (some brokers receive entire commission, with nothing going to Compass, for their first 8 deals)\n\nSummary/prediction: Strategy makes sense, and they are buying real assets. The SoftBank effect (drunk capital) likely means they have overpaid. Value will decline, but not implode, making it one of SoftBank's better real estate investments.\n\nOYO\n\nBusiness model\n\nBuy or franchise run-down hotels, fix up, train staff, and take a commission (25-30%)\n\nYogababble\n\n\"To offer tasteful spaces, whenever you need them, at unbeatable prices.\"\n\nFunding\n\nDifferentiation\n\nImproving fallow assets (old/out of date hotels)\n\nNo global player for budget hotels\n\nUses a tech platform to help hotel partners with distribution\n\nFeces (red flags)\n\nBought Hooters Casino in Las Vegas for $135 million (sold for $54 million 4 years ago, signal of overpaying)\n\nLeadership: Ritesh Agarwal \u2014 25, first venture\n\nLightspeed Ventures and Sequoia Capital getting out of dodge: selling 50% of their stake for $1.5 billion\n\nSoftBank (and founder) putting money in: Ritesh Agarwal invests $700 million in latest $1.5 billion fundraising round with Softbank helping to fund the remainder\n\nSoftBank has been a lead investor in every round since 2015 (smoking own supply)\n\nReviews = sh*t\n\nSummary/prediction: OYO feels like the WeWork of budget hotels with red flags the size of Days Inns. A 25-year-old founder and SoftBank is a toxic mix. Yes, the Zuck and Bill Gates founded their firms at the same age, but it's a bad strategy to assume your CEO is the next Zuck/Gates. Founders buying additional shares is a good sign, unless you are 25 and borrowing against your existing shares to buy more. That means he's hugely committed and immature.\n\nLightspeed and Sequoia also have too much capital and are under pressure to deploy additional money in portfolio firms where they've negotiated pro-rata investment rights for subsequent rounds. With OYO, they not only passed, but having the full inside information and observing the CEO, they've decided to sell shares. Customer feedback is awful, and customer acquisition does not appear to be scaling. Here. We. Go.\n\nOpendoor\n\nBusiness model\n\niBuying: sell your house to Opendoor in less than 24 hours in all-cash deal; firm collects service charge, resells house, and offers financing to a captive market\n\nYogababble\n\n\"To empower everyone with the freedom to move.\"\n\nFunding\n\nDifferentiation\n\nProvide immediate cash to homeowners\n\nHugely inefficient market ripe for disruption\n\nCompelling value proposition (liquidity in traditionally illiquid asset class)\n\nFeces (red flags)\n\nManagement and board have little real estate experience\n\nThe risks of iBuying are substantial in a downturn\n\nCan algorithms replace nuance of valuation in real estate?\n\nSummary/prediction: A compelling value proposition in a market that's hugely dislocated/inefficient. Without knowing average hold/margin on properties, difficult to assess. In absence of this data, feels like a levered bet on US real estate market.\n\nThe bigger story\n\nThe business story of the month is WeWork's meltdown. The bigger story will be SoftBank's Vision Funds impairment. Earlier this year, we predicted the 2019 IPO unicorn class would lose money \u2014 YTD is up 5%, vs. 13% in 2018 and 94% in 2017. The 2020 story will be a 50%+ decline in the value of privately traded unicorns. The world is not as impressed with Silicon Valley as Silicon Valley is with itself.\n\nAn 11-year expansion, cheap capital, and investors chasing a Facebook/Google high have resulted in an environment that is not \"different this time.\" People love WeWork and Uber as I loved Pets.com and Urban Fetch. A 60-pound bag of dog food and a pint of Ben & Jerry's delivered next day/hour for less than cost was awesome, except for shareholders. Value is a function of growth and margins. Many/most of today's unicorns have deployed massive capital to achieve the former while not demonstrating the patience or skill to achieve the latter. Record deficits during full employment are irresponsible, as is capital-driven growth meant to create the illusion of innovation.\n\nThere is also a bigger fault line. In 1999 I was 34 and running an e-commerce incubator (Brand Farm) backed by GS, JPM, and Maveron. I mistook my good fortune \u2014 being born a white male in '60s California \u2014 for talent. My money/success was a virtue that gave me license to demonstrate poor character and a lack of empathy. The market had a swift and effective immune response to my ailment.\n\nThere is, again, an epidemic of hubris that has rendered the Unicorn Industrial Complex a hot zone.\n\nThe good news? The antidote is imminent.", "description": "Professor Scott Galloway says that Softbank is to real estate unicorns as earthquakes are to California.", "authors": ["Scott Galloway"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f9eb64af90935b55d2bd4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
