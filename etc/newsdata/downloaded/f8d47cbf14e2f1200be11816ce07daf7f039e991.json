REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the attack.\n\nA senior U.S. official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world\u2019s biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it. Iran has denied this.\n\nSpeaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying appealed for calm and restrain.\n\n\u201cPondering who is to blame in the absence of a conclusive investigation I think is in itself not very responsible. China\u2019s position is that we oppose any moves that expand or intensify conflict,\u201d Hua told a daily news briefing.\n\n\u201cWe call on relevant parties avoid taking actions that bring about an escalation in regional tensions. We hope all sides can restrain themselves and can jointly safeguard the peace and stability of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nChina has close economic, diplomatic and energy relations with both Riyadh and Tehran and has long had to tread carefully in its ties with both. Saudi Arabia is China\u2019s top oil supplier year to date.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman visited Beijing in 2017, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman came to China earlier this year.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met the Chinese government\u2019s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, in Beijing late last month.", "description": "China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was irresponsible to blame anyone for an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities without conclusive facts, striking a cautious note after the United States blamed Iran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430369477&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0E6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
