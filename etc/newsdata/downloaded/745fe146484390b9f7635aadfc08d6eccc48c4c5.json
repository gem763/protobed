I\u2019ve not done anything wrong. Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 these allegations are about Alberto Salazar.\u201d\n\nSalazar had previously guided Farah to four Olympic and six world titles. The scandal has cast fresh scrutiny over Farah\u2019s decision to stick with Salazar for two years after the doping allegations against the American first surfaced in 2015.\n\nBut in a defiant appearance ahead of Sunday\u2019s Chicago marathon, Farah turned his fire on the press, saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the coverage but refusing to say whether he felt let down by Salazar. \u201cI feel let down by you guys, to be honest,\u201d he responded.\n\nHowever, he added that he flew to the US to confront Salazar in 2015, saying: \u201cHe assured me at the time these are just allegations, this is not true \u2026 and he promised me. And that hasn\u2019t been true.\u201d", "description": "Mo Farah insisted his reputation remained untarnished, saying he was happy to be tested \u201cany time, anywhere\u201d as he addressed the doping scandal surrounding his former coach Alberto Salazar in a defensive press conference on Friday.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur", "Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212748761-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYHaHRqZzVuMJAn8HN8r1s25xHFBv-aIg4TgE5NfOlH8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
