It also highlights how celebrities are increasingly able \u2013 and willing \u2013 to circumvent traditional media outlets and take them on directly.\n\nRooney, the wife of footballer Wayne, has been dubbed \u201cWAGatha Christie\u201d for her role in the investigation, after the \u201cwives and girlfriends\u201d moniker that was given to the partners of England footballers at the 2006 World Cup.\n\nShe published a series of fake news updates on her private Instagram account over the summer and slowly reduced their audience in a bid to identify the leaker. This led to apparently fake articles about Rooney seeking baby gender selection treatment in Mexico, a planned return to television, and a flood at her new-build mansion appearing in the Sun.\n\nOn Wednesday Rooney went public, claiming the only account that had viewed the story about the flood at her new home belonged to Vardy.\n\nIn response, Vardy has suggested that someone else with access to her Instagram account may have been responsible for passing on information.\n\nHer representative briefed MailOnline that she has hired \u201cIT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram\u201d to identify who else had access in an attempt to clear her name, although it unclear exactly what this forensic analysis would involve. Vardy\u2019s agent did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe model Danielle Lloyd, herself the former partner of a footballer, on Thursday told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that she had previously had run-ins \u201cover similar things\u201d with Vardy, also appearing to accuse Vardy of being the author of a Sun on Sunday column entitled \u201cSecret WAG\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday Vardy called the new claims \u201cbollocks\u201d and said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything more until we\u2019ve finished looking into this situation properly.\u201d", "description": "Vardy suggests someone else with access to her Instagram account could have leaked stories to the Sun", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0769c9c329ca78fa3e709975655defcc6d998e5b/0_95_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34c315354954d1518274b95abed92691", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
