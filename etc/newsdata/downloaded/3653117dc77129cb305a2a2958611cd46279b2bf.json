Trump, Giuliani, Fruman and Parnas show how it's done. All in one month.\n\nIgor Fruman and Lev Parnas, the indicted Ukrainians helping Rudy Giuliani dig up dirt on Joe Biden, had an unnamed accomplice: the Supreme Court's controversial 2010 Citizens United decision that opened the floodgates to unlimited spending on elections.\n\nFruman and Parnas were arrested at Dulles International Airport this month with one-way tickets to Frankfurt. Hours before their arrest, they had lunch with Giuliani at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Ukrainians pleaded not guilty to charges of using a shell corporation, Global Energy Producers (GEP), to funnel $325,000 to America First Action, Inc., a super PAC aligned with President Donald Trump. The indictment said the money came from a Russian businessman.\n\n'Independent' spending for access\n\nIt's a crime for foreign nationals to make American political contributions, and for anyone to file false reports with the Federal Election Commission, as Fruman and Parnas allegedly did about the source of the money.\n\nAmerica First PAC says it's \u201cthe primary super PAC dedicated to electing federal candidates who support the agenda of the Trump-Pence Administration.\u201d It does this by making \u201cindependent expenditures\u201d for favored candidates. GEP and America First are corporations. That\u2019s where Citizens United comes in.\n\nFrom left in this Facebook post, Donald Trump Jr., Tommy Hicks Jr., Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. (Photo: The Campaign Legal Center via AP)\n\nThe Roberts 5-4 majority held that the campaign finance law barring corporations from spending money to support political candidates violated the First Amendment. There were two main themes.\n\nFirst, the Constitution protects \u201cspeech\u201d regardless of the speaker's corporate identity.\n\nSecond, the court said that \u201cindependent expenditures,\" which it conceded could be used to gain \"ingratiation and access,\" cannot corrupt candidates because they don't control the spending.\n\nCitizens United enables corruption\n\nResult? The birth of super PACs like America First: Independent expenditure corporations that accept unlimited donations and spend them to support their candidates.\n\nSo except for Fruman and Parnas\u2019 apparent lying about their source of funds, what they did was perfectly legal under Citizens United. They used a corporation \u2014 GEP \u2014 to donate $325,000 to an independent expenditures PAC, America First, and that corporation could spend the money on favored candidates. They thus exploited both major themes of Citizens United. The decision enabled their crimes.\n\nIndeed, Ukraine-gate illustrates precisely how independent expenditures can corrupt. Consider that Giuliani says he met Fruman and Parnas in \"mid-to-late-2018.\" Now consider all the things that happened in May 2018, according to public reporting and the federal indictment:\n\n\u25baGEP made a $325,000 contribution to America First.\n\n\u25baFruman and Parnas were photographed with Trump at an eight-person White House dinner.\n\n\u25baThey were photographed with Donald Trump Jr. at a breakfast in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n\u25baThey met then-Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas at a fundraising event sponsored by America First and committed to raising $20,000 for him.\n\n\u25baThey solicited his help getting Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine, fired.\n\n\u25baSessions wrote Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seeking her dismissal.\n\nAnd later, Parnas connected Giuliani with Viktor Shokin, the former prosecutor who protected corrupt Ukrainians and whose (now debunked) claims about Biden were at the center of the infamous Trump phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe Supreme Court gave corporations permission to buy \"ingratiation and access\" through \u201cindependent expenditures,\u201d leading the Trumpians straight into the swamp.\n\nWilliam Bennett Turner, who practiced law for 45 years and teaches courses on freedom of speech and the press at the University of California-Berkeley, is the author of \"Free Speech for Some: How the Supreme Court is Weaponizing the First Amendment to Empower Corporations and the Religious Right.\" Dennis Aftergut is a former federal prosecutor now in private practice.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
