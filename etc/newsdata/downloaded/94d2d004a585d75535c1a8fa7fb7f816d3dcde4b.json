(Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images)\n\nMichigan State\u2019s offense didn\u2019t do much. Its defense had its worst drive of the day at an inopportune time. And the special teams committed a massive blunder.\n\nMatt Coghlin missed a game-tying 47-yard field goal as time expired that would have sent the Spartans\u2019 game Saturday against Arizona State into overtime. Coghlin\u2019s dreadful miss came after he absolutely drilled a 42-yard field goal that had seemingly sent the game to OT\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nInstead, Michigan State had 12 men on the field during Coghlin\u2019s first kick.\n\nMICHIGAN STATE HAD 12 ON THE FIELD!!!!! pic.twitter.com/n262wrw7mT \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) September 14, 2019\n\nThe penalty was called after a replay review. When Coghlin\u2019s second kick was wide Arizona State escaped with a 10-7 win. Though maybe he should have gotten a third try.\n\nArizona State players jumped in an attempt to block the field goal in a possible violation of the rule against leaping and using leverage to block a kick in college. Unlike the 12 men on the field penalty, leaping has to be called on the field and can\u2019t be reviewable. It wasn\u2019t called on the field.\n\nDantonio says \"They tried to hurdle us, that should be a penalty.\" Says that was not reviewable. \"I think they need to take a good, hard look at the officiating. That's all I'll say, because there were some disputes out there.\" \u2014 Chris Solari (@chrissolari) September 15, 2019\n\nThe game\u2019s winning TD came courtesy of RB Eno Benjamin, who reached for the goal line with 50 seconds left to set up Michigan State\u2019s final drive of the game.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat touchdown came as Michigan State\u2019s defense seemingly had no idea that Arizona State QB Jayden Daniels was allowed to scramble. Daniels had three scrambles in four plays \u2014 including a 15-yard jaunt to convert a fourth down \u2014 to set up Benjamin\u2019s touchdown.\n\nThey all came as Michigan State\u2019s defense had dropped deep to prevent a touchdown while leaving plenty of open space underneath for Daniels to run into.\n\nMichigan State offense struggles ... again\n\nThe Spartans trailed 3-0 at halftime and didn\u2019t score a TD until almost halfway through the fourth quarter when Elijah Collins scored on a nine-yard run with just over eight minutes to go in the game.\n\nThat was the best moment of the game for Michigan State\u2019s rushing game. The Spartans finished the game with 35 carries for 113 yards and Collins averaged fewer than four yards a carry.\n\nThe connection between QB Brian Lewerke and WR Darrell Stewart is fantastic. And clearly the best facet of the offense. Stewart had nine catches for 121 yards. But the offense had to twice settle for field goal attempts before the final drive. And Coghlin missed them both.\n\nMSU has a defense that\u2019s capable of winning the Big Ten East. But the offense may end up making any hopes of winning the division moot.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Michigan State appeared to send the game to OT but had 12 men on the field on the game-tying field goal.
