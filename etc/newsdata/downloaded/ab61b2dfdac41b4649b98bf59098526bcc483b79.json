You can form your own view.

They\u2019re playing to their strengths and he\u2019s built a team that\u2019s got depth as well.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

belted and we got belted as well. We played the British and Irish Lions the year before and they [South Africa] arrived in 1994. It was a guy called Adrian Geldenhuys, he had octopus arms I think. I didn't get him back, but I met him in a lift in Pretoria about a year ago. I hadn't seen him for a long time but he got me a beauty. Then the final whistle went and there was Mark Andrews and myself laughing. It was the game in those days.\u201d\n\nBut Mitchell is not in the slightest bit daunted by them, and not just because as a former New Zealand player and coach he is programmed that way. It is because like Jones, and like every other member of this 31-man squad, the 20-something backroom staff around it and now the millions watching in anticipation back home, this England team believe it is more physical, more dominant and more brutal than any other on the planet.\n\n\u201cWhen I have watched the Springboks as a kid, then played against them - I was lucky to do that in one tour - and played against South African teams and coached them, I guess I used to look at them and think they are the one side in the world that can create pressure like no other team,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBut what is great about that is that there is now another team that can create that pressure - and that is us. And that is what Springboks rugby has always been built on - that ability to create pressure.\n\n\u201cThey are very forward dominated. And they love their scrum, love their lineout drive and love the physical nature of the game. There are so many ways you can play this game and they play it in a particular way and always seem to have an intimidator at No 4 and that is just their way - and it works for them.\u201d\n\nOne of England\u2019s main enforcers remains Courtney Lawes, who has only played the Springboks three times in a 10-year international career \u2013 and never on South African soil. Lawes has seen his fair share of South Africans come through the gates of his club side, Northampton Saints, with Victor Matfield, Heinrich Brussow and Brian Mujati all playing alongside him, as well as current international Cobus Reinach.\n\nBut while Lawes may be one of England\u2019s big ball-carriers, he admits he is dwarfed by his opposite numbers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like the smallest second row in the world!\u201d laughed Lawes. \u201cI\u2019m not too bothered about the size of people generally because I generally chop low. I\u2019m strong enough and powerful enough, that\u2019s the main thing. And I can get around the park. That\u2019s all I\u2019m worried about.\n\n\u201cThey just are bigger. They are tough guys, they\u2019re brought up tough and they play tough. But so do we, so we\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nLawes could find himself replaced in the starting line-up against South Africa despite impressing against the All Blacks, given Jones\u2019s desire to have as strong a possible side for the end of the final due to the power contained on the Springbok bench.", "description": "England\u00a0believe they know exactly what the South Africa\u00a0will throw at them in this Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup final, with assistant coach John Mitchell having first-hand experience of what they can do if they\u2019re allowed to assert their physical dominance.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/17/John-Mitchell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
