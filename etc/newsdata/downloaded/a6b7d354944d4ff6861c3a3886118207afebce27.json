Google developed Site Isolation because browser bugs often allowed sites to jump the SOP barrier and steal user data stored in the browser, created by other sites.\n\nChrome engineers started work on Site Isolation in 2017 and rolled out the feature to all desktop users with the release of Chrome 67 in May 2018, reaching 99% coverage by July 2018.\n\nAt the time, Google called Site Isolation a triumph despite Site Isolation not working at its full potential.\n\nThe feature's rollout came just in time to provide protections against side-channel attacks like Meltdown and Spectre -- two vulnerabilities that impacted CPUs, disclosed in early 2018, and which could allow attackers to jump the barrier between apps and steal data from Chrome.\n\nWhile Site Isolation was never designed to stop CPU bugs, it did stop these types of issues; hence the reason Google opted to roll it out, even if it wasn't exactly how it originally envisioned Site Isolation to work.\n\nBut behind the scenes, work on Site Isolation continued after July 2018, with Google engineers building Site Isolation into the comprehensive security feature they originally wanted to create. Today, Google announced two major developements, along with future Site Isolation plans.\n\nSite Isolation to roll out for some Android users\n\nThe first of these is that Site Isolation is now available for some Android users.\n\nGoogle said today it enabled Site Isolation for 99% of the Chrome Android userbase that has a smartphone with 2GB or more of RAM.\n\nOn these devices, when users visit a site where they enter passwords, Chrome will spin that site into its own process, to protect the site and the user's data from Spectre-like malicious code running on other sites.\n\nSite Isolation was added in Chrome for Android v77, released last month in September. Users who updated to this version and have a phone with more than 2GB of RAM have the feature enabled already.\n\nWhen enabled, Google said it expects the Site Isolation feature to incur a 3-5% increase in memory usage.\n\nChrome Android users who don't own a device with enough memory, or users who want to use Site Isolation on all sites (not just those where they enter passwords), can visit the chrome://flags/#enable-site-per-process to enable Site Isolation at all times. However, Google said that this would also incur even a higher RAM overhead, of which users should be aware.\n\nProtection against more attacks on desktop\n\nBut while Site Isolation is taking its first steps on smartphones, the feature is expanding on desktops.\n\nAccording to Google, starting with Chrome 77 released last month, Site Isolation on desktops can protect users against more exploit types than the original support for side-channel (Spectre-like) attacks.\n\n\"Our initial launch targeted Spectre-like attacks which could leak any data from a given renderer process,\" Google engineers said today. \"Site Isolation can now handle even severe attacks where the renderer process is fully compromised via a security bug, such as memory corruption bugs or Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) logic errors.\"\n\nMemory bugs and UXSS vulnerabilities have been used in the past. Attackers usually placed malicious code on sites that exploited these types of vulnerabilities. When a user accessed the malicious site, the exploit code would trigger, and extract data from other sites that had been stored inside Chrome.\n\nNow that Site Isolation was expanded to detect and stop such attacks, Google says this won't be possible anymore, as each site's data (such as cookies and passwords) will be site-locked, and moved in a separate Chrome process altogether.\n\nMemory and UXSS bugs that could bypass SOP won't be useful anymore. If hackers want to steal browser data, they'll need exploits that can escape the Chrome sandbox and jump to another OS process.\n\nFurthermore, Site Isolation also prevents access to more data types, and not just passwords and cookies. Per Google, these are the user data categories that Site Isolation can now safeguard from malicious code:\n\nAuthentication: Cookies and stored passwords can only be accessed by processes locked to the corresponding site.\n\nNetwork data: Site Isolation uses Cross-Origin Read Blocking to filter sensitive resource types (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON, PDF) from a process, even if that process tries to lie to Chrome's network stack about its origin. Resources labeled with a Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header are also protected.\n\nStored data and permissions: Renderer processes can only access stored data (e.g., localStorage) or permissions (e.g., microphone) based on the process's site lock.\n\nCross-origin messaging: Chrome's browser process can verify the source origin of postMessage and BroadcastChannel messages, preventing the renderer process from lying about who sent the message.\n\nFuture plans\n\nBut Site Isolation still has a lot of room to expand before actual \"site isolation\" is achieved, at all levels of the Chrome codebase. The optimum scenario will be when each site runs in its own process and they can access only their own data.\n\nThis is not yet possible in Chrome because of Chrome's current architecture -- but this will change in the future.\n\nHere are Google's future plans for Site Isolation:", "description": "Google also expands Site Isolation protections for desktop users.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/30/38ddb412-5fad-4deb-aadd-bc3042428c52/thumbnail/770x578/642e6476470b4f4f3ec67691b23482ca/chrome-security-5c51bfbe60b25418cca7e783-1-jan-30-2019-18-18-36-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
