You can\u2019t do that on your own. So thank you ladies.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nNeita added: \u201cDina knows how proud we are. She\u2019s been doing her thing since day one. She\u2019s killing it, she\u2019s smashing it. Onto next year and bigger and better things.\u201d\n\nAsked what it would take to turn silver into Olympic gold, Philip replied: \u201cNot much clearly if we\u2019ve just changed the team five minutes before!\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talented. Best believe that gold is coming. For now we\u2019ll let them Jamaica have it and we can have it in a year\u2019s time.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBritain gave up their men\u2019s world sprint relay crown - but it took the third fastest run in history to deny them.\n\nAdam Gemili and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake had come to Qatar firmly believing they would retain the title they won in London.\n\nAnd with Zharnel Hughes and Richard Kilty joining them their optimism was well-paced as they smashed the European record with a 37.36secs run.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut on the night it was not enough as they came up against an inspired American team on a mission to avenge the beating they took two years ago.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to hold up your hands,\u201d said Gemili, after the US quartet clocked 37.10secs to break their own national record.\n\n\u201cWe ran a British record and pushed for the gold but the Americans were better than us.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty)\n\nBut Kilty added: \u201cIt took the third fastest time ever to beat us. We can get gold in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nThe two faster relays in history unsurprisingly both belong to Jamaican teams featuring Usain Bolt.\n\nWho know what time Britain might have managed had not Hughes torn his hamstring on the second leg.\n\n\u201cWhen I handed the baton, I pulled it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had to give it to Richard whatever because tonight was about getting a medal.\n\n\u201cThe guys the glory I have, the fight which is inside me, I did my best. We are going home with something around our necks.\u201d", "description": "Kent rocket becomes first Briton ever to win three medals at a single world championships", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters", "Afp Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470817.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_17th-IAAF-World-Athletics-Championships-Doha-2019-Day-Nine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
