It is not, for instance, a show about flirting. Even characters who bone, get hitched, procreate, or co-parent together often ooze the chemistry of two sheets of sandpaper. They also all dress terribly. Those issues are perhaps related.\n\nFor all its perennial cast shake-ups\u2014particularly momentous in the past few seasons, with original series lead Andrew Lincoln\u2019s departure\u2014The Walking Dead is also, it knows, not an especially adventurous sort. It doesn\u2019t aim to be one of those fancy critical-darling shows that reinvent themselves every season to explore new avenues of inquiry into the human condition. It sometimes gestures at being one, sure. But that dilettantish impulse soon subsides, and why shouldn\u2019t it? The monster ratings it consistently pulls through season after season of cyclical us-versus-them bloodlust and warmongering are enough for this sweet, simple zombie show, god bless America.\n\nNo, The Walking Dead\u2019s real ambition ten seasons in, what it still does better than almost any show on television, and what\u2019s on full display in this year\u2019s season premiere (\u201cLines We Cross\u201d) is the goo: the show\u2019s special and practical zombie effects. The sheer craft and creativity of the show\u2019s effects teams have outshone its narrative imagination for years and are still a thrill to behold.\n\nSpecial makeup effects artist Greg Nicotero, a horror veteran who also directs Sunday\u2019s episode, and his team have an unrivaled command of grotesquerie. The slippery shine of \u201craw,\u201d disemboweled intestines. The stretching and tearing of \u201cskin\u201d and cartilage on a person\u2019s face as they\u2019re being eaten alive. While the show\u2019s writers recycle the same conflicts with different enemies every season or so\u2014same \u201cus,\u201d different \u201cthem\u201d\u2014Nicotero & Co.\u2019s bottomless appetite for ever more creative permutations of zombies, guts, and gore is still a reliably perverse delight.\n\nThe opening minutes of \u201cLines We Cross\u201d serve as a showcase for Nicotero\u2019s talents. Not only does he depict the scene\u2014a routine battle drill among the residents of Oceanside\u2014with genuine momentum and a sense of danger, but he also luxuriates in the goo of it all. The slow-motion splatter of rust-colored blood as Michonne (Danai Gurira) slices a walker\u2019s head in half. The monstrous tangle of driftwood and limbs as a waterlogged zombie emerges from the ocean. The clean \u201csplat!\u201d as a walker\u2019s dismembered face lands face-up in the sand. All too soon it\u2019s over and we\u2019re back to the snail\u2019s pace of the episode\u2019s other dramatic offerings. But even there, there are glimmers of life amid the drudgery.\n\nThe show\u2019s current problem areas\u2014again with the excruciatingly stiff flirting, this time between Jules (Alex Sgambati) and Luke (Dan Fogler)\u2014remain untended, for the most part. Lauren Cohan\u2019s absence is alluded to only in awkward asides about letters from Maggie, without revealing where, exactly, she\u2019s gone. (The actress left the show last season for an ABC drama that was promptly canceled, though TWD\u2019s head creatives insist she might one day return.) Aaron (Ross Marquand) is saddled with the obligatory regurgitation of one of Rick\u2019s favorite crises of identity, the same tired quandary the show has dug up a dozen times before: \u201cAre we the good guys?\u201d he stops to ask Michonne in the middle of a high-tension operation, or are they \u201cthe villains of someone else\u2019s story?\u201d Perhaps he missed the bit where the Whisperers left an actual infant to be eaten alive by zombies.\n\nAlpha (Samantha Morton) and the Whisperers are still MIA, though Judith turns up one of their skin-masks on the shore (another delightfully creepy effect). That sends everyone into a tailspin about the potential return of this season\u2019s Big Bad. The real villain of the episode, however, is a dastardly inanimate object: a satellite that plummets through the sky in a blaze of bright light, then crashes and sparks a fire in the forest bordering Oceanside. It\u2019s panic. It\u2019s mayhem. It\u2019s\u2026 actually a remarkably efficient and well-organized several long minutes of total mundanity. \u201cFire was the beginning of the end for The Kingdom. I\u2019m not letting that happen to Oceanside!\u201d booms Ezekiel, in an example of the show\u2019s laziest method of characterization: having people recall events from the past out loud, as if that\u2019s equivalent to showing how they\u2019ve changed in the time since.\n\nOne character who has benefited from the handful of episodes since Rick\u2019s departure, however, is Daryl (Norman Reedus), who has slowly regained some of the charm and innocence that made him a fan favorite in the show\u2019s early years. His connection with Connie (Lauren Ridloff) has worked wonders for him, with endearing shots of the sign language guide tucked in his back pocket, and the dopey way he splutters \u201cReally?\u201d after Connie tells him he signs \u201cin a Southern accent,\u201d like he isn\u2019t sure whether that\u2019s good or bad. (Such is Ridloff\u2019s charisma, too, that she radiates swagger with just a look and a single line written on paper.)\n\nDaryl\u2019s reunion with Carol (Melissa McBride), and the pair\u2019s idle dream of running away together and starting over without the conflict-prone knuckleheads they\u2019ve palled around with for nine years, meanwhile, is the brightest spot of the episode. She teases him for calling her his \u201cbest friend.\u201d Half-annoyed, half-amused, he gripes \u201cOh my god\u201d in that faux-beleaguered way best friends do. It manages what so little of the show\u2019s dialogue ever does: making these characters sound like real people.\n\nStill, an interesting thing happens in a conversation between Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Gabriel (Seth Gilliam), one that veers exhilaratingly close to self-awareness for the show. Negan\u2019s behaved well enough during his life imprisonment to be granted a long enough leash to perform basic chores: taking out the trash, picking tomatoes, all under close supervision. Rather than a sign of the Alexandrians\u2019 faith in his rehabilitation, however, his limited freedom is, he notes, simply a result of the colonies having someone new to hate. A \u201cbogeyman,\u201d as he puts it. There\u2019s ripe ground there for examination of the show\u2019s paltry faith in stories about what bonds people together other than fear of a common enemy. (For a few brief episodes at the beginning of last season, the show indulged more complex storylines about the formation of governments, the distribution of power and privilege, and how such constructs, no matter how well-intentioned, tend to marginalize people. It was a welcome change of pace\u2014and then came the Whisperers. The show soon fell back into old habits.)\n\nNegan drops the subject, of course, before the show dares to critique its own reductive psychology\u2014though Daryl does echo the sentiment later. \u201cSometimes I think we\u2019re just surviving one fight to the next,\u201d he tells Carol, sounding weary. For a moment, I hoped the pair would make good on their word, ditch the endless cycle of war, and strike out on their own for a new life of seafaring, motorcycling adventure. No more \u201cthem,\u201d just \u201cus.\u201d But invisible strings hold them back, and by episode\u2019s end, Carol is left facing the enemy again. I felt sorry for her. She and Daryl are far from the only ones tired of the same old routine.", "description": "The plot may be drudgery, the flirtation wooden.
