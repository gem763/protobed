You\u2019re not alone; many users have been reporting these issues for weeks, and it appears Android\u2019s WebView feature is to blame.\n\nViewing pages in WebView differs from using the main Chrome app or other mobile web browsers, as it lets you navigate websites without having to load an external app. The benefits of this feature are self-evident, but there has been a rising number of freezes and crashes reported by users who are trying to open web pages with WebView.\n\nThe bug reports showing up on Twitter, official message boards, and support forums aren\u2019t limited to specific devices or Android versions \u2014 and even include the recently launched Android 10 on Pixel phones. The good news is that, for most users on Android 7.0 or higher, there is a way to temporarily disable WebView until an official fix rolls out:\n\nOpen the Google Play Store app. Tap the three stacked lines \u201chamburger\u201d icon. Tap \u201cMy apps & games.\u201d Scroll down and tap \u201cAndroid System WebView\u201d from the apps list. In the app\u2019s settings page, tap \u201cUninstall\u201d to disable it.\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse, Google Play Store App\n\nWith WebView disabled, you\u2019ll need to set your main mobile browser as the new default app the next time you load an in-app website. This means that pages will load externally, but doing so seems to be more stable.\n\nThat said, some users have reported that even the main Chrome app is experiencing crashes as well. In that case, it may be wise to change your default browser to something else for the time being.\n\nWhere your default apps menu is located can differ between devices and Android versions, but Pixel phones Running Android 10 will find the page in their settings app. Go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > default apps >Default browser, and then tap the browser you wish to use.
