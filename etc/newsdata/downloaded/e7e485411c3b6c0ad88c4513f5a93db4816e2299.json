They come as the administration is trying to revise the so-called Flores agreement, a long-standing court order that outlines standards of care for migrant children and families.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMany children in HHS custody already faced trauma in their home countries or during their journey to the United States, according to the watchdog report, which was based on visits to 45 shelters operated by the department's Office of Refugee Resettlement in August and September 2018. Children then experienced additional trauma after they were separated from their parents, including intensified fear, feelings of abandonment and post-traumatic stress.\n\nShelter staff said that they were unprepared to address the problems because of a lack of resources and ongoing efforts to reunify children with their parents. The share of children under the age of 12 in ORR custody rose to 24 percent from 14 percent from April to May of last year.\n\nThe shelter staff also said Trump administration policies requiring sponsors of children to undergo fingerprint background checks delayed unifications and led to overcrowding in shelters.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Only four of the 45 facilities that inspectors visited had a mental health specialist such as psychiatrist, psychologist or psychiatric nurse practitioner on staff, and most contracted with external specialists. But facilities had a hard time finding mental health staff because of remote locations and low pay.\n\nAs a result, the report found children often had to wait two to three months for an appointment with a provider.\n\nThe refugee office additionally had just 50 residential treatment beds available for children with bipolar disorder, suicidal tendencies and other more serious conditions.\n\nHHS said has already taken steps in response to the findings, including hiring more mental health providers, developing a webinar on trauma in unaccompanied children for staff, developing an internship program placing students with an interest in mental health fields in refugee office programs and providing additional funding for staff retention.\n\nThis article tagged under: Immigration\n\nUndocumented immigrants", "description": "The findings come as the administration is trying to revise a court order that outlines standards of care for migrant children and families.", "authors": ["Renuka Rayasam"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/52/e2/c096bb3548babb69563e96ddcad3/1984-migrant-gty-773.jpg"}
