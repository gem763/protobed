MUSCAE USE HOUSEFLIES? Entomophthora muscae infect houseflies, penetrating their skin. It grows throughout the flies' bodies, digesting their guts and killing them in five\u2013seven days. The fungi can even hijack the insects' brains \u2014 forcing them to land on a surface and crawl upwards to give the parasite a better shot at spreading. On the fly corpse, the fungi grows an array of tiny spore cannons to infect other flies that come nearby.\n\nTo investigate exactly how these fungal cannons work, physicist Jolet de Ruiter of the Technical University of Denmark and colleagues created a similar weapon of their own in their laboratory.\n\nThe researchers cannon comprised a millimetre-sized barrel made of a rubber-like polymer, filled with fluid and plugged at the end with a projectile.\n\nBy carefully controlling the pressure in the cannon as it built up to ejection, the tea, were able to study the efficiency of the dispersal weapon.\n\nThey measured this in relation to the barrel's size and shape, as well as the elasticity of the cannon's sides.\n\nFrom this, the researchers were able to show that the real-life fungal spore cannons are well-configured to traverse the still air around a fly corpse.\n\nFrom here they reach the air currents created by its target and can go on to infect a new host.\n\n'The calculated flight trajectories under aerodynamic drag predict that the minimum spore size required to traverse a quiescent layer of a few millimetres around the fly cadaver is approximately 10 micrometers,' the researchers wrote in their paper.\n\n'This corroborates with the natural size [of] E. muscae [spores] \u2014 approximately 27 micrometers \u2014 being large enough to traverse the boundary layer.'\n\nTo investigate exactly how these fungal cannons work (left), researchers led from the Technical University of Denmark created a similar weapon of their own in their lab (right)\n\nThe spores, they added, are still 'small enough \u2014 less than 40 micrometers \u2014 to be lifted by air currents,' the researchers continued.\n\n'Based on this understanding, we show how the fungal spores are able to reach a new host.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.", "description": "After killing a host fly, the bizarre fungus grows on the corpse a set of micro-sized stalks, each one a pressurised spore cannon - which Danish and Dutch researchers have now reproduced in the lab.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340952-0-image-a-35_1572372907841.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
