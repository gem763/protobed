But they also got us thinking - what makes for a good photo-op?\n\nSo, we've dug into the archives and put together this short guide. Aspiring politicians: take heed.\n\nDo: Think carefully about the setting\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption North Korean leader Kim Jong-un pictured travelling in typically understated fashion\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nFair question. That's Kim Jong-un riding a white horse through the snowy woods of the country's highest mountain.\n\nA number of striking - and frankly poetic - images of Mr Kim on a chilly-looking Mount Paektu were released by state media earlier this week.\n\nWhat can we learn from it?\n\nThat the setting of a photo-op really matters.\n\nNorth Korea insists that Mt Paektu was the birthplace of Mr Kim's father and predecessor. In this sense, analysts view these images as a not-so-subtle reminder of Mr Kim's authority and power.\n\n\"These pictures are designed solely for domestic consumption,\" says long-time North Korea watcher Professor Hazel Smith. \"They mimic pictures of his grandfather on a white horse and are meant to help provide legitimacy and authority to his rule.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mt Paektu holds symbolic meaning in North Korean culture\n\nBut, experts say, they are fundamentally designed to emphasise Mr Kim's superiority.\n\n\"They give people the image that [he] is very different,\" says North Korea expert Dr Sojin Lim. \"That he is not an ordinary human being - more like a God.\"\n\nDon't: Forget about body language\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption It's fair to say there have been warmer political handshakes\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nThat's former UK Prime Minister Theresa May sharing a frosty handshake with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year. Awkward.\n\nWhat can we learn from it?\n\nThat body language, especially facial expressions, are key to a good photo-op.\n\nAnd don't assume that the visible tension here is some kind of mistake. That can send a clear message too.\n\nThis particular meeting was the first between the two leaders since the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the UK. The UK blamed Russia, which denied any role in the attack.\n\nSo, tensions were high. It's fair to say this image made that abundantly clear.\n\nDo: Show off your interests\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nIt's Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoying some shirtless downtime in Siberia.\n\nMr Putin has become something of a photo-op legend, with images of him hunting, fishing, and exercising popping-up pretty regularly.\n\nWhat can we learn from it?\n\nThat photo-ops are all about projecting an image. And Mr Putin has a carefully managed one.\n\n\"They are an essential part of how he perpetuates his political image,\" says Professor Kataryna Wolczuk, an expert in Russian politics. But why is he so often pictured doing outdoor activities?\n\n\"It's all about masculinity,\" Prof Wolczuk explains. \"Russian men are expected to be strong, close to nature, and engaged in all sorts of daring pursuits. Putin uses these images to project himself as an action man.\"\n\n\"There's a cultural tradition here that power is for physically strong people,\" she adds.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nBut it's not all guns and wrestling. \"Putin, and other leaders, also take care to show they have a softer side. He tries to appear well-rounded,\" Prof Wolczuk says.\n\nHence the picture of him with the fluffy dogs.\n\nDon't: Fear looking ridiculous\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nThat's current UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stuck helplessly on a zip wire.\n\nIt happened in 2012 while he was still London mayor. It doesn't look any less uncomfortable today.\n\nWhat can we learn from it?\n\nThat an apparent photo-op disaster can actually work out (relatively) well.\n\nAlmost immediately after Mr Johnson was pictured dangling from the wire, an array of memes and jokes about him spread online. Take this one:\n\nFor most politicians this would spell disaster. But, as one witness told The Guardian earlier this year, \"he seemed to take the buffoon and run with it\".\n\nSeven years later and he finds himself in Downing Street. Perhaps more aspiring prime ministers should consider a comical zip wire trip.\n\nDo: Get pictured regularly\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nThat stylish man is Turkmenistan's President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov.\n\nHe's known for his strongman image (despite the puppy) and for his ostentatious PR stunts. He also wrote a rap song about horses and a book about tea drinking. Don't ask.\n\nWhat can we learn from him?\n\nThat it's important to have photo-ops, at least occasionally, if you're a country's leader.\n\nWhy? Well, because otherwise people might assume that you've died.\n\nRumours of Mr Berdymukhamedov's death spread like wildfire earlier this year after he hadn't been seen in public for weeks.\n\nState TV broadcast footage of the president riding a horse, driving a rally car and shooting targets on holiday in an attempt to dispel the rumours. But there was no evidence any of it was recent.\n\nIt wasn't until he was pictured at an event in a Caspian Sea resort town that rumours of his death were put to bed. Lesson learnt.\n\nDon't: Get caught editing\n\nImage copyright Al-Ahram\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nThat grainy image (it's from a newspaper) shows Egypt's then-President Hosni Mubarak leading former US President Barack Obama and other world leaders along a red carpet in 2010.\n\nIt was taken at the White House shortly after Middle East peace talks were re-launched. Straightforward enough, right?\n\nWhat can we learn from it?\n\nThat when it comes to photo-ops things are not always as they seem.\n\nHere's the original image - spot the difference:\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAs you can see, in the actual image Mr Obama leads the way and Mr Mubarak trails behind.\n\nTo be fair to Mr Mubarak, it was Egypt's state-run newspaper rather than his office that altered the image. But it still proved to be embarrassing.\n\nDo: Consider the optics\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nThis historic image was taken on US President Donald Trump's first day in the Oval Office. (It was the 23rd January 2017, for the record).\n\nIt shows him signing an abortion-related order. He's surrounded by various top White House figures, including Vice-President Mike Pence on the left.\n\nWhat can we learn from it?\n\nThat the people in the background matter.\n\nThis fairly standard photo-op garnered a significant backlash. Column inches, Twitter threads and TV airtime were all dedicated to the reaction.\n\nWhy was the response so fierce? Because, as critics of the order were quick to point out, there are no women in the picture.\n\n\"All of these people seem eminently qualified to determine WOMEN'S health care. Not,\" one Twitter user said at the time. \"Notice anyone missing?\" another asked.\n\nBut one person's questionable photo-op can be another's opportunity. So, right on cue, Sweden's deputy prime minister responded with what many felt was a mocking parody.\n\nTouch\u00e9.", "description": "After Kim Jong-un is pictured on horseback, here's how other world leaders have utilised the cameras.", "authors": ["Gareth Evans", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C72A/production/_109268905_befunky-collage-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
