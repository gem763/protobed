Despite the emergence of iron-clad evidence about the Serbian regime\u2019s crimes, Handke went so far as to attend the former dictator\u2019s trial in The Hague \u2014 and, later, his funeral.\n\nDefenders of the Swedish Academy\u2019s decision have claimed Handke\u2019s views should be kept separate from his unique artistic ability and contributions to literature. Some have also argued the Austrian writer\u2019s intention was always to provoke, and that his unconventional political beliefs should be seen as part of a broader attempt to spark debate and free political thought from excessive constraints.\n\nSeparating Handke\u2019s literary work from his politics would be a great mistake. Given its approval of Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s regime and its casual dismissal of victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing and torture, Handke\u2019s work is deeply political.\n\nThe starkest example of Handke\u2019s flawed narrative is the short travelogue \u201cJourney to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia,\u201d published in 1997, in which he documents the daily life of local Serbs after the end of the Balkan wars of the early 1900s.\n\nHandke is also astoundingly silent when it comes to Serbia\u2019s central role in the 1990s Balkan tragedy.\n\nAs Handke points out in the epilogue, his rationale was not to gather \u201cevil facts\u201d but to provide a soul-searching narrative that will sustain peace. The Serbs who appear in Handke\u2019s narrative are ordinary, empty-pocketed, innocent souls who sleep in unheated basements. He describes them eating sarma (stuffed cabbage) and kajmak (cream cheese) and drinking wine from Smederevo, \u201cwhere the Danube flows without a sound.\u201d In his retelling, these are people who are deeply wounded by the scorn of the rest of Europe, which turned its back on them.\n\nBy focusing on the daily experiences of local Serbs, however, Handke overlooks the tragedy of other ethnic groups in the region and reinforces the narrative of the \u201cwronged\u201d Serb championed by Milo\u0161evi\u0107, whose rise to power was fueled by the idea that Serbian citizens were victims who needed to rise up in defense of their freedom and dignity.\n\nHandke is also astoundingly silent when it comes to Serbia\u2019s central role in the 1990s Balkan tragedy, including the genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He presents the atrocities committed by Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s regime as allegations made by Western media outlets, rather than hard facts documented by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n\nBy ignoring hard facts, Handke provides an implicit amnesty and apology for the Serbian leader\u2019s genocidal endeavor. He\u2019s also attempting to rewrite history. Ignoring Serbia\u2019s hegemonic ambitions and state-sponsored genocide allows him to paint Slovenia and Croatia as the initiators of the break-up of Yugoslavia and attribute the merits of the post-Dayton peace in Yugoslavia to Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\n\nHandke\u2019s work cannot be disentangled from the political service it did the late Serbian leader. His political pamphlets are not literature \u2014 they are calls to hate that reinforce prejudice.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Handke should be read, studied and discussed. But elevating his work above other more deserving nominees for the Nobel Prize was a careless mistake. As the author and literary critic Hari Kunzru put it, \u201cHe is a fine writer, who combines great insight with shocking ethical blindness.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel Prize will not make Handke a great writer. In choosing the Austrian author, the Swedish Academy has only succeeded in diminishing the value of the prize and wading into yet another scandal that will tarnish its reputation for decades to come.\n\nEdi Rama is prime minister of Albania.", "description": "Giving Peter Handke the Nobel Prize elevates an apologist for genocide, ethnic cleansing and torture.", "authors": ["Edi Rama", "Wolfgang Ischinger"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175097489-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
