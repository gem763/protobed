Ensure your eyebrows look on point; you can use an eyebrow pencil to fill in the brows. Highlight the cheekbones, temples, brow bones and bridge of your nose with a silver-toned highlighter. Apply a rose pink blush on the apples of your cheeks. A creamy nude lipstick goes on next. Now comes the main focus of this makeup: the eyes. First, apply a soft lavender eyeshadow to your eyelids and below your lower lash line. Then, on the crease of your eyes and below the waterline, apply a brown shimmery eyeshadow. Blend in these two eyeshadows well. Reapply the lavender eyeshadow over the blended one to give that colour pop. Finish your eye makeup with generously applied volumising mascara on both upper and lower lashes. Use a makeup setting spray to ensure the makeup remains in place.\n\nTraditional makeup look tip: Blend the eye makeup well, and don\u2019t let it look disjointed.\n\nCasual Chic Makeup Look\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Ananya \u00f0\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u009f\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u0092\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u009b\u00f0\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u009f\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u0092\u00ab (@ananyapanday) on Jun 16, 2019 at 11:52pm PDT\n\nFor some of the Diwali celebrations, you just want to go the traditional way and get those smoky kohl-rimmed eyes that are simple yet striking. Let Ananya Pandey give you some beauty inspo on how to rock that look, for any type of ensemble you could wear. Here\u2019s how to get the look.\n\nStart with your CTM routine, and then move on to the lip balm and primer. For your foundation, add two drops of liquid illuminator before putting it on. Use an illuminating concealer. Use an eyebrow pencil to fill in your brows if required. Highlight your Cupid\u2019s bow and use a pearlescent pink lipstick for your lips. Contour cheekbones with a cream bronzer. Use a black shimmer gel eyeliner pencil on your waterline and upper lash line. Then smudge it with a sponge tool to achieve a smoky effect. Use a volumising mascara for lashes. Spray on some makeup setting spray.\n\nTraditional makeup look tip: Ensure your smudge and blend well.\n\nSun-Kissed Traditional Makeup Look\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Lekha Gupta (@makeupbylekha) on Mar 9, 2019 at 9:40am PST\n\nIf you like to keep it all-natural, be like Kiara Advani and get that sun-kissed look. The look is very versatile as it goes with just about any type of ensemble in any colour. Wear it for those family brunches during Diwali. Here\u2019s how you can get the look.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Lekha Gupta (@makeupbylekha) on Mar 9, 2019 at 7:27am PST\n\nDo the CTM routine first, followed by a lip balm, primer, foundation and concealer. Fill your eyebrows with eyebrow powder and brush it in place. With a highlighter, get your temple, brow bones, cheekbones and bridge of the nose highlighted. A peach blush on the apple of your cheeks and a glossy coral lipstick gives that fresh look. Use a light gold shimmer eyeshadow all over your eyes. Add a bronze shimmer eyeshadow close to the upper lash line as it will add some soft definition to the eyes. For your eyes, inner corners\u2019, use a silver shimmer eyeshadow. From the outer corners to inwards till halfway through the waterline, use a light brown pencil to enhance the eyes. Use a makeup setting spray as the final step.\n\nTraditional makeup look tip: The coral lipstick and metallic eyeshadows make the look feel sun-kissed as it adds that shimmer and softness.\n\nGo Pink Look\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Janhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) on Jun 19, 2019 at 12:08pm PDT\n\nThe colour pink is an eternal favourite for traditional ensembles. So match your pink ensemble with pink makeup, just like Janhvi Kapoor. With the many shades and hues of the colour available, you can get a perfect match \u2013 in complementary shades of pink. Opt for this look to go with those pretty dhoti-pants and crop tops in pink for any of the Diwali festivities like Bhaidooj.\n\nHere\u2019s how to get the look. Begin with the basics of CTM, lip balm, primer, foundation and concealer. Use a matte foundation for this look and an illuminating concealer. Fill in the brows if required. Use a creamy, stick highlighter on your temples, brow bones, bridge of your nose, cheekbones and cupid\u2019s bow. Apply a light beige shade of eyeshadow with a silver shimmer, all ver your eyelids. Use a brown kohl pencil to define the waterline. Use volumising mascara. Apply a soft pink blush on the apples of your cheeks. For the lips, begin with a fuchsia pink lip liner. Use it for the outline and to fill in the lips. Over this, apply a bright fuchsia pink lipstick to finish the look. Set the makeup in place with a makeup setting spray.\n\nTraditional makeup look tip: Ensure your blush colour is not same as your lips. Use a softer strawberry pink on cheeks.\n\nGlitter Glam Makeup Look\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Kangana Ranaut (@team_kangana_ranaut) on Jul 7, 2019 at 7:54am PDT\n\nGo glam with glitter, a la Kangana Ranaut. Bring out your inner diva by having your makeup shine and sparkle this Diwali. Ensure though that you aren\u2019t OTT with the glitter usage. Applying just the right amount is key to rocking this look. Here\u2019s how you can get this look.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Kangana Ranaut (@team_kangana_ranaut) on Jul 7, 2019 at 7:55am PDT\n\nBegin with a CTM routine and follow it up with your lip balm, a mattifying primer, a hydrating foundation and an illuminating concealer. Use brow wax for your eyebrows. Highlight the temples, brow bones, bridge of nose, Cupid\u2019s bow and cheekbones using a stick highlighter. Use a bronzer over the bones for contouring. For your cheeks, use an apricot-shade blush. No need to add colour to the lips as the glittering eyes will do the talking, but just add a pearlescent nude lipstick. For the eyes, begin with a warm coffee-toned eyeshadow on the crease of your eyelids. Then, apply rose gold glitter eyeshadow on your lids and lower lash line. Use a black liquid eyeliner to define the upper lash line. Finish with a makeup setting spray.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional makeup look tip: When you\u2019re using a bold makeup colour or texture (like glitter), don\u2019t overdo it by applying it on everything. Bolder eyes should have subtle lips and cheeks and vice versa.\n\nBright and Glowing Makeup Look\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Alia \u00f0\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u009f\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u008c\u00b8 (@aliaabhatt) on Mar 6, 2019 at 7:35pm PST\n\nRadiant as always, Alia Bhatt always manages to look on point. Take a cue from her for your Diwali makeup look and ensure you look bright and glowing. This means using just the right makeup to highlight your features without overdoing it and letting your natural beauty be the focus. Here\u2019s how you can get this look.\n\nBegin with a CTM routine. Then comes the lip balm, primer, hydrating foundation and concealer. The eyebrow wax will keep your brows in place. Take the high points of your face like cheekbones, temples, brow bones and bridge of your nose and use a highlighter over them. The blush for this look is rose pink and the lipstick is also in pink but of a light fruity shade. Use the lipstick with a pearlescent finish or creamy satin. First, apply a soft pink eyeshadow to your eyelids and below your lower lash line. Then, get a rose gold shimmer eyeshadow for the inner corners of your eyes and blend it in for a soft highlighting effect. Apply silver shimmer eyeshadow to the eyelids and below the lower lash line. Blend for a smooth finish. Finish with volumizing mascara, followed by the setting spray.\n\nTraditional makeup look tip: No bright colours of any form will work for this look, so avoid them.\n\nMetallic-Hued Look\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by pati dubroff (@patidubroff) on Jun 3, 2019 at 7:22pm PDT\n\nGlam it up with metallic makeup just like Priyanka Chopra Jonas. While the makeup palette used was nude, the colours were all in a metallic hue that made the look stand out. If you were wondering what makeup to sport for those Diwali card parties, the search is over. Get this look.\n\nFirst, you need to do the CTM routine. Then, use the lip balm, primer, matte foundation and concealer. Use a brown eyebrow pencil to fill in your brows. Using a creamy bronzer, contour your face. Use a creamy highlighter on your cheekbones. Use a red blush for the apples of your cheek, without making it too loud. Wear a nude matte lipstick, and then add some metallic beige pigment to your lips. Layer it up with clear gloss. Use an eyeshadow primer before the eyeshadow. Then, use a matte beige eyeshadow on your eyelids creating up-turned angles on the outer corners. Apply the same eyeshadow shade below your waterline and connect it to the angles. Take some beige metallic pigment with an eyeshadow brush and layer it over the matte eyeshadow. Use volumising mascara for both the lashes. Use a setting spray at the end.\n\nTraditional makeup look tip: Practice the edgy eye makeup before doing it on the final day to ensure you do it right.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the most essential step for doing any makeup?\n\nDon\u2019t forget the CTM \u2013 cleanse, tone and moisturise \u2013 routine. Apply the primer, foundation and concealer in the right order too, to ensure your makeup looks on point.\n\nI am wearing a white ensemble at one of the Diwali parties. Which makeup look would you suggest?\n\nYou can go for just about any of the looks mentioned here.
