EBay EBAY, -0.56% has been focused on advertising and payments as new drivers of momentum.\n\nSee: Why eBay is betting on payments to help its turnaround\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from the company\u2019s third-quarter report.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect that eBay earned 64 cents a share for the third quarter, after adjusting for stock-based compensation and other expenses. On Estimize, which crowd sources projections from hedge funds, academics and others, the average estimate calls for 67 cents a share in adjusted EPS.
