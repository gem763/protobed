Ur tripping because I want a specific kind of cat? U weren't tripping when I got my dog Oscar and he wasn't a rescue... every pet we get must be a rescue?\n\n\"I believe in adopting rescues but also think there are preferences and that's what breeders are for.\"\n\nImage copyright Robert Kamau Image caption Justin bought the cats a few days before marrying Hailey Bieber for the second time\n\n'Think more deeply'\n\nBut Peta say Justin Bieber could \"inspire his fans around the world to save a life by adopting a cat from a local \u200eanimal shelter\".\n\nIn a statement, the group urged the singer to \"think more deeply about this issue\".\n\nResponding to his \"suck it\" comment, they said, \"when millions of animals are \u200elosing their lives every year because not enough people adopt - choosing instead to shop - the \u200eanimal overpopulation crisis is a real problem. That's what sucks.\" \u200e\u200e\n\nSushi and Tuna are not the Canadian star's first exotic pets.\n\nIn 2013 Justin was given a Capuchin monkey called OG Mally, which he tried to take on tour to Germany.\n\nThe monkey was confiscated from him and donated to a German zoo.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Justin Bieber told Peta to 'suck it' after they criticised him for buying two designer kittens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0713/production/_109111810_gettyimages-1127630025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
