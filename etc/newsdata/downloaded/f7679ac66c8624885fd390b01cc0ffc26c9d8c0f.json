Apple didn't launch anything all that exciting Tuesday that wasn't expected. But that may not be a bad thing.\n\nShares of Apple (AAPL) were relatively flat before the unveiling of the iPhone 11 and other new products. The stock was still mostly unchanged as the event wore on.\n\nBut the reason Apple is up more than 35% this year has more to do with the company's shift toward subscription services than new phones, iPads and Apple Watches. And Apple did deliver some compelling new services Tuesday at consumer-friendly prices.\n\nApple said its Arcade gaming subscription service, which launches on September 17, and its Apple TV+ lineup of original programs that will debut on November 1, will each cost just $4.99 a month.", "description": "We're at Apple's big September event, where the company unveiled the iPhone 11.", "authors": ["Cnn Business' Kaya Yurieff", "Cnn Business' Ahiza Garcia", "Cnn Business' Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business' Paul R.
