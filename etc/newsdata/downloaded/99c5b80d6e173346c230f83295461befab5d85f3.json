He did it in Oakland, and again in New England.\u201d\n\nThe move ends one of the most tumultuous signings in New England\u2019s history and leaves uncertainty about Brown\u2019s future in the NFL.\n\nFor his part, Brown seems confident he has one.\n\nVegas also apparently thinks Brown has a future in the league \u2014 this year.\n\nWill Antonio Brown play another down in the NFL this season?

But Antonio is healthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL. He wants to play the game he loves and he hopes to play for another team soon. \u2014 Drew Rosenhaus (@RosenhausSports) September 20, 2019\n\nThe Patriots signed Brown to a $10 million contract after he was cut by the Oakland Raiders prior to Week 1 of the season, but they were not due to pay him the first of two bonus installments until Monday. As of now, it sounds like Brown may not get any cash from the team outside of his game checks.\n\nThe #Patriots gave Antonio Brown a $9M signing bonus on his 1-year deal \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t all due at signing, and there\u2019s usually forfeiture language. As one NFL exec told me: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any money yet so at least they can hold it while they fight about it.\u201d \u2014 Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) September 20, 2019\n\nOn timing, the #Patriots cut Antonio Brown before having to pay his full signing bonus. Plus, got out of paying him if he winds up on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list. From that perspective, beyond all the obvious, this makes a lot of sense. \u2014 Adam Kaufman (@AdamMKaufman) September 20, 2019\n\nBrown played a single game in New England. He caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "In the wake of new allegations against Antonio Brown, the New England Patriots have released the mercurial wide receiver.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AB-sidelines.jpg?fit=1024%2C707", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
