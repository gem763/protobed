Women experience economic, workforce and healthcare disadvantages, intimate partner violence, gendered violence in public places, and street harassment.\n\nWomen are also faced with denials gender inequality still exists in 2019. Some people presume anti-discrimination legislation, equal pay, and ensuring motherhood is not a barrier to workforce participation are all that's needed to achieve gender equality.\n\nBut sexism pervades society in many more subtle ways \u2014 and its impacts are not always so tangible. This discrimination is committed not just in the workplace and on the streets, but in social settings and in our own homes, sometimes by the people who love us.\n\nIt can also start young, like when parents enlist daughters to serve guests at a family gathering, and sons are free to relax with their male relatives.\n\nEveryday sexism might not be noticed by perpetrators or bystanders, but it can wear women down and is linked to poorer physical and mental health.\n\nRead more: Whistling and staring at women in the street is harassment \u2013 and it's got to stop\n\nWhat is 'everyday sexism'?\n\nResearchers have examined experiences of everyday sexism using a daily diary method. In series of studies from the United States, researchers asked 107 women and 43 men to record in a diary any sexist incidents they encountered over a period of two weeks.\n\nOne type of sexism the participants encountered was the endorsement of traditional gender role prejudices and stereotypes. One participant, for example, reported being told not to \"worry her pretty little head about these complex insurance issues.\"\n\nAnother type of everyday sexism participants encountered was demeaning or derogatory treatment, such as sexist jokes and language.\n\nA third type of sexism was sexual objectification, such as street harassment and unwanted touching. For example, one participant reported having a stranger at a party squeeze her waist while he was walking past.\n\nIn some contexts, women may not experience any formal barriers to participation, but may still be faced with cultural norms that disadvantage them.\n\nWomen in traditionally male-dominated fields such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and maths), for instance, can be targets of prejudice and negative stereotyping which undermines their success.\n\nThis negative stereotyping may include being underestimated and assigned easier tasks. Women might also experience social exclusion and isolation, such as not being invited to out-of-hours catch-ups.\n\nRead more: Overt or covert, sexism at work causes real harm\n\nRules and laws against gender discrimination don't prevent people with sexist attitudes from treating others unfairly in everyday interactions. This is particularly true when it is perpetrated unconsciously, in ways that aren't detectable to everybody.\n\nDiscrimination gets under your skin\n\nWhile individual instances of this unfair treatment might seem so minor as to be harmless, they can be frequent and ubiquitous. Everyday sexism is often present at a constant low-level in the background of our lives, adding an extra layer of stress.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these subtle forms of everyday sexism have been linked to poorer mental health.\n\nThe daily diary study described above found more frequent reports of everyday sexism predicted poorer psychological well-being.\n\nEarlier research showed that experiences of sexism were linked to poorer mental and physical health, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), binge drinking, and smoking.\n\nMore recently, a study found experiences of gender discrimination in the workplace accounted, in part, for poorer health outcomes in women compared to men.\n\nThere are, however, factors that moderate the relationship between discrimination and health outcomes. Women with higher self-esteem, for example, don't seem to suffer the ill-effects of discrimination as much.\n\nRead more: Sexism isn't just unfair; it makes women sick, study suggests\n\nGiven the pervasiveness of gender discrimination, research on its impact on mental health is still disproportionately low. But the existing research findings are corroborated by studies of the mental health impacts of discrimination based on race and sexual orientation.\n\nIt might be invisible to some\n\nStudies consistently show that the perception you're being discriminated against on any grounds is linked to poorer mental and physical health. And subtle forms may be as harmful as more overt forms of discrimination.\n\nEveryday sexism might be difficult to recognise by those who don't experience it. Research shows men are less likely to accept evidence of gender discrimination than women. This is likely due to perceptions and everyday observations being limited by our own experiences and our biases.\n\nAnecdotal evidence alone is insufficient to demonstrate the full reality of everyday sexism and its impacts. Scientific research reveals far more than our intuitions do about the nature of these phenomena, with greater accuracy.\n\nSexism is a health issue\n\nGiven this link to well-being, it's reasonable to consider sexism a public health issue.\n\nDoing so widens the circle of those considered responsible for protecting the well-being of those affected. Governments are obliged to reduce this health disparity, just as they invest in reducing other public health concerns, such as smoking and obesity.\n\nRead more: Sexism isn't just unfair; it makes women sick, study suggests\n\nWhile gender stereotypes remain as entrenched now as they were 30 years ago, there is promising evidence we can learn to reduce everyday sexism.\n\nOne such intervention simulates an experience of discrimination by randomly assigning one group of participants to experience \"small and seemingly innocuous advantages\" in a game.\n\nDirect experience of discrimination, and critical reflection on it, increases recognition of the harm it causes and increases the intention to overcome it.\n\nCreating a fairer society requires some antidote for the health impacts caused by sexism. But as we know, prevention is better than cure.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
