The social media app will eliminate these filters in the coming weeks, in a response to the negative impact they can have on users.\n\nSpark AR, the company that creates Instagram Story filters, has announced that in the coming weeks, all filters that mimic the effects of cosmetic surgery will be removed and no similar ones will be added: \"Spark AR effects to be a positive experience and are re-evaluating our existing policies as they relate to well-being.\"\n\nThis move follows new restrictions announced in September that will limit, and in some cases ban, weight-loss and cosmetic-surgery ads from the platform. The new rules, which will be rolled out worldwide, will ban all posts that make \"a miraculous claim about certain diet or weight loss products, and [are] linked to a commercial offer such as a discount code\". Other posts that promote weight loss products or cosmetic procedures in other ways will only be shown to users over the age of 18.\n\nThese measures are part of a new strategy by Instagram to improve the experience for their users and to lessen the damaging mental health issues that can be caused by this unrealistic portrayal of beauty.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It is part of an effort to prioritise the mental health of its users", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1yScM8iJBn6WCqsOv4I2Sw--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg3NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/f026a0a7144685b7f64d52c42c42e2d8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
