They were targeting the U.S., North Africa and Latin America. Three of the networks were Iranian, while one was Russian.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, told reporters that the Russian network had the \u201challmarks of a well-resourced operation\u201d with potential links to the Russian Internet Research Agency, a group that carried out interference campaigns during the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nFacebook emphasized in its announcement that the accounts were taken down \u201cbased on their behavior, not the content they posted.\u201d\n\nAs part of the crackdown, Facebook is updating its \u201cinauthentic behavior policy\u201d to improve its ability to identify \u201cbad actors,\u201d including taking down accounts that are working together to spread disinformation, along with other major changes.\n\nIn a press call on Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergOn The Money: Trump dismisses 'phony Emoluments Clause' after Doral criticism | Senate Dems signal support for domestic spending package | House panel to consider vaping tax Hillicon Valley: Facebook removes Russian, Iranian accounts trying to interfere in 2020 | Zuckerberg on public relations blitz | Uncertainty over Huawei ban one month out Facebook to label content from state-run media MORE detailed the company's work to prevent disinformation and voter suppression in 2020.\n\nZuckerberg told reporters he is \u201cconfident we are a lot more prepared\u201d than in the 2016 cycle, while also acknowledging the need to stay vigilant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a much better place in dealing with this, but this isn\u2019t an area where we can take our eye off the ball, or where you ever fully solve the problem,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cYou refer to this as an arms race, I think that is probably the right analogy, we\u2019re getting better, they\u2019re getting better, I think right now we\u2019re doing quite well, but this is certainly an area that we all need to be focused on.\u201d\n\nAround 126 million people may have seen content from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency, according to testimony given by Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch on Capitol Hill in 2017.

The bipartisan report recommended an \u201cintegrated approach\u201d involving both the public and private sectors to address disinformation, an assessment Zuckerberg supports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that everyone needs to work together,\u201d Zuckerberg said Monday.\n\nZuckerberg also unveiled a set of new set of policy changes and tools for election security.\n\nThe platform unveiled \u201cFacebook Protect,\u201d a service for campaigns to help secure them against hacking. Campaigns that opt in to the service will have to \u201cturn on two-factor authentication, and their accounts will be monitored for hacking, such as login attempts from unusual locations or unverified devices,\u201d according to Facebook.\n\nThe social media giant is also adding a tab to all pages with information about their operators, including location, legal name or website.\n\n\u201cPeople are still going to be able to post and follow the content that they want, but for example if a page is about a domestic policy issue, people are now going to be able to see a prominent label that it's coming from another country,\u201d Zuckerberg said on the call.\n\nFacebook will also identify content coming from state-controlled media, which it defines as outlets \u201cthat are wholly or partially under the editorial control of their government,\u201d starting next month.\n\nThe policy change is likely to affect outlets like Russia Today, which reportedly was used by the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election.\n\nIn the next month, Facebook will also begin labeling content that has been rated false or partly false by third-party fact-checkers. That change will also be made on Instagram.\n\nZuckerberg defended a recent policy to not remove political ads featuring misinformation, unless they could potentially incite violence or lead to voter suppression.\n\n\u201cIn general we give very broad deference to political speech \u2014 we believe that in a democracy people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"Facebook has been the defender of a lot of the debate, but I do think that our policies are broadly in line with what a lot of other internet companies do, and a lot of TV folks.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also said that Facebook's rules on preventing voter suppression would take precedence over political speech.\n\n\u201cThe voter suppression rules would be paramount in that case,\u201d he said when asked how Facebook would deal with a candidate posting content that could stop citizens from voting. \u201cThere have to be exceptions when there is an overwhelming risk. \u2026 Voter suppression is calling to remove another\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\nFacebook also announced a separate commitment Monday of $2 million for media literacy efforts.\n\n\u201cThese projects range from training programs to help ensure the largest Instagram accounts have the resources they need to reduce the spread of misinformation, to expanding a pilot program that brings together senior citizens and high school students to learn about online safety and media literacy, to public events in local venues like bookstores, community centers and libraries in cities across the country,\u201d the company said.", "description": "Facebook on Monday announced it had taken down networks belonging to Russian and Iranian actors on both Facebook and Instagram, part of a new effort to secure the platforms from foreign interference ahead of the 2020 election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/facebook_043019getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
