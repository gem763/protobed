Biden on Friday recalled advising Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016 about how to handle questions involving the now-infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape when it surfaced during the final weeks of her failed White House bid.\n\nReleased roughly a month prior to President Trump defeating Mrs. Clinton in the race, the tape \u2014 a 2005 recording from the TV show \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d in which he bragged about how he could, as a celebrity, grab women by their genitals \u2014 emerged days before both candidates participated in the second of three televised presidential debates.\n\n\u201cI remember at the time saying, you know, the first question that\u2019s going to be asked is they\u2019re going to ask [Trump] about his comments about the Access Hollywood tape,\u201d Mr. Biden recalled during a campaign event in New Castle, New Hampshire, BuzzFeed News reported.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, I really think what should be done is \u2014 that they\u2019re going to turn to [Clinton] and say, \u2018What\u2019s your view?\u2019 And I said, I\u2019d respectfully recommend she stand there and \u2026 say, \u2018Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let me tell you what I am going to do for the country,\u2019 and not get into the debate, because it just drags it down,\u201d added Mr. Biden, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nBrian Fallon, a Democratic activist who worked on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, raised questions about Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks, BuzzFeed reported.\n\n\u201cIs he suggesting Hillary\u2019s reaction to the Access Hollywood tape should have been, \u2018Oh, nevermind?\u2019\u201d asked Mr. Fallon, according to the outlet. \u201cThat is a pretty Mad Men-era mentality.\u201d\n\nAn aide for Mr. Biden subsequently issued a statement clarifying the candidate\u2019s comments, BuzzFeed News reported.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t criticizing Hillary,\u201d the Biden aide said, according to the outlet. \u201cHe was criticizing the media for creating false equivalencies that minimized Trump\u2019s atrocious and repugnant behavior.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump were both asked about the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape early on during the second debate days after its release.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So yes, this is who Donald Trump is.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, on his part, apologized during the debate for the remarks while dismissing his comments as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d\n\nRecently polling has placed Mr. Biden as the Democratic frontrunner among candidates hoping to compete against Mr. Trump in 2020. He served as a surrogate to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016 while serving as vice president to former President Barack Obama.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
