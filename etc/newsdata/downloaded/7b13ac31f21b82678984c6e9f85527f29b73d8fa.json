We are concerned about the impact (of the attack), but so far we hear from port agents that it has been OK,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cOur oil loading has not been impacted yet,\u201d another one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cBut we need to see the official notice from them (Aramco) ... It will take a bit more time to see the impact.\u201d\n\nThe sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nThe attacks knocked down 5.7 million barrels per day of crude production - more than half of top exporter Saudi Arabia\u2019s output, or over 5% of global oil supply. Saudi officials have given no timeline for restoring full supply.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s return to full supply capacity after Saturday\u2019s attacks could take \u201cweeks, not days\u201d, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nOil prices surged as much as 19% in early Asian trade on Monday on worries over global supply and tensions in the Middle East.", "description": "Saudi Aramco has told some clients that vessel loading has resumed following disruptions caused by the weekend's attacks on Saudi oil facilities, two sources who received the notice told Reuters on Monday.", "authors": ["Shu Zhang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
