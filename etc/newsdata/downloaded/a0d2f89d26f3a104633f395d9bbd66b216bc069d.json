She has also noticeably eradicated go-to phrases like \u201cwe need to have that conversation\u201d from her public vocabulary, after criticism she seemed too cautious .\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve made it more clear, but I\u2019ve been clear the whole time,\u201d Ms. Harris said of her policy vision. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought and talked about what wakes people up in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nStill, at times, Ms. Harris\u2019s attempts to occupy a pragmatic middle ground between progressive firebrands and old-school Democratic moderates can land in awkward ways. In late July, she said \u201cI\u2019m not trying to restructure society,\u201d but in recent weeks she has released a criminal justice plan that would overhaul prisons and police practices, and embraced the possible elimination of the Senate filibuster to pass the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cI plan on restructuring things in a way that will address those things that wake people up in the middle of the night,\u201d Ms. Harris clarified last week. \u201cThat\u2019s the consistent through line from the beginning. And frankly, even before I ran, I\u2019ve always thought about it around that kind of metaphor.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders and Ms. Warren often target Wall Street corporations as the root cause of people\u2019s problems, and Mr. Biden has singled out President Trump as a unique existential threat. When asked what she views as the root cause of societal problems, Ms. Harris said leaders do not see and understand the tangible hardships of working families.", "description": "She had a great June debate and lost steam over the summer. Her surrogates, donors and even some supporters hope that in Houston she can recapture the magic that initially won them over.", "authors": ["Astead W.
