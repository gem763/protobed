Some 150,000 UK holidaymakers are being repatriated at taxpayers\u2019 expense following the demise of the world\u2019s oldest tour operator. On 28 September, a further 16,700 customers were set to be flown home.\n\nHundreds of employees of Thomas Cook Airlines are expected to gather at the conference on 30 September to express their anger. \u201cThey won\u2019t be overly political but they feel abandoned by the government,\u201d said a spokesman for the Unite union.\n\nA group of workers will then travel to London to protest outside 10 Downing Street on 2 October. Among them is former cabin attendant Emma Boxen, who learned of the collapse via social media. She is owed over \u00a32,000 in pay but says she has not received any official communication from the company. \u201cI can\u2019t afford my mortgage. I have all of my bills to pay. It is just horrible,\u201d she said. Online funding pages are being set up to help former employees with the cost of travel to London, she added.\n\nThe business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been accused of acting far too late after she set up a taskforce to help those affected. The parliamentary business, energy and industrial strategy committee has announced an inquiry into the role of \u201ccorporate greed\u201d in the collapse, focusing on directors\u2019 stewardship of the firm, their pay, and the role of auditors.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook is likely to wreak havoc on tourist industries around the world, and nowhere more so than Greece, where locals considered the company too big to fail. Manolis Giannoulis, head of the hoteliers\u2019 association in Chania, Crete, said: \u201cIt was the second-largest tour operator in Europe. Falling like this proves that anything can happen. The damage is huge, probably in the region of \u20ac80m \u2013 and that\u2019s only here,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a national crisis, coming just as our economy is returning to normality.\u201d\n\nOver half of Crete\u2019s 2,000 hotels worked with Thomas Cook, and the insolvency left 20,000 customers stranded on the island.\n\nTourism accounts for 25% of Greek GDP and one in five jobs. Britain\u2019s biggest holiday operator to Greece, Thomas Cook flew in 3 million visitors a year, and employed more than 1,000 people on the ground. For Michalis Vlatakis, president of Crete\u2019s travel agents\u2019 association, the firm\u2019s liquidation resembled an \u201cearthquake\u201d that would inevitably send a tsunami through the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the contracts that are lost, but all those that won\u2019t materialise,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther north on the Aegean island of Skiathos, where Thomas Cook flew 40,000 passengers in the past year, the impact is \u201cjust massive,\u201d according to Thodoris Tzoumas, mayor of the island that shot to fame as the setting for the 2008 film Mamma Mia! \u201cI don\u2019t think I can convey how big it is.\u201d\n\nAs in Crete, hoteliers on Skiathos were owed three months\u2019 payments by the company in what was peak season for the sector. Officials estimate losses of up to \u20ac500m countrywide \u2013 a staggering amount for a debt-stricken nation.", "description": "Former staff waiting for pay plan to take protests to Tory conference, and Greek hoteliers face a \u20ac500m hit", "authors": ["Shane Hickey", "Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bc7a93e192b9a01f47343c2f0af51e90e2820ce/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=082bf3eeee61ba9276f07061a478edad", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
