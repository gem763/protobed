Taylor Jr. \u2014 among other evidence \u2014 makes clear, State Department officials and other government employees were enlisted in the effort to persuade Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. As Taylor put it in a Sept. 9 text to U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, the goal appeared to be to use the levers of U.S. policy to extract Ukraine\u2019s \u201chelp with a political campaign\u201d \u2014 the Trump\u2019s campaign for reelection.\n\nAn enterprise of that sort emanating from the Trump White House, if proved, would be the very kind of activity the Hatch Act was designed to prevent. The text of the law flatly states that an employee of the executive branch may not, among other things, \u201cuse his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis prohibition has been part of federal law for over a century. President Teddy Roosevelt included very similar language in an executive order he issued in 1907, modeling it, in turn, on a civil service rule dating to the administration of Chester A. Arthur. In 1939, Congress codified the strictures in the Hatch Act after an investigation confirmed that officials in FDR\u2019s Works Progress Administration had promised jobs and promotions in exchange for votes.\n\nAs spelled out in federal regulations, the Hatch Act bars a federal employee from using his or her official title while participating in \u201cpolitical activity\u201d or using his or her authority \u201cto coerce any person to participate in political activity.\u201d \u201cPolitical activity,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201can activity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group\u201d \u2014 which, of course, would include activity directed toward the success of Trump\u2019s reelection campaign or the failure of Biden\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nIn general, violations of the Hatch Act are pursued civilly by the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency; punishment can include firing or suspension without pay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImportantly, the president and vice president are exempt from the Hatch Act\u2019s civil restrictions on political activity. But that\u2019s not the end of the matter. The Hatch Act also includes criminal prohibitions that apply to everyone, including the president. At least two of them are relevant to the investigations surrounding the Ukraine matter.\n\nTitle 18, United States Code, Section 610, makes it a crime \u2014 indeed, a felony, punishable by up to three years in prison \u2014 for \u201cany person to intimidate, threaten, command, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, command, or coerce, any employee of the Federal Government \u2026 to engage in \u2026 any political activity.\u201d Congress enacted this criminal statute in 1993, when amending the Hatch Act, to provide \u201cadditional protections against political manipulation of the federal workforce,\u201d as a 2017 Justice Department publication put it.\n\nIn short, the president and his aides cannot commandeer the federal bureaucracy in service of the president\u2019s purely partisan political objectives as a candidate for office. Notably, Section 610 does not require a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d nor does it require that the object of the political activity constitute a \u201cthing of value\u201d \u2014 conditions required to demonstrate the existence of extortion, bribery and violating campaign finance law. If Trump commanded, or coerced or intimidated, State Department officials or other federal employees to engage in impermissible political activity \u2014 or attempted to do so \u2014 that itself would be a criminal violation of the Hatch Act. (This would also be true of other top officials who recruited government employees for the effort.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe available evidence suggests that, on orders of the president and his acting chief of staff, career diplomats at the State Department were shunted aside to pave the way for an effort to push Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings (the company Hunter Biden was a director of) and supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Sondland and special envoy Kurt Volker allegedly proceeded to press Ukrainian officials to do just that, using the promise of a White House meeting and, later, release of much-needed military aid as inducements. According to Taylor, Sondland said the president \u201cinsist[ed]\u201d and \u201cwas adamant\u201d that Zelensky publicly commit to these investigations and assigned Sondland to convey that message to Zelensky and a top aide, Andrey Yermak. Sondland repeatedly emphasized in his testimony that the president \u201cdirected\u201d him to allow Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to guide those efforts, and that he understood Giuliani \u201cwas expressing the concerns of the president.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another Hatch Act-related offense that may have been committed. Under Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 600, which was part of the original Hatch Act, it is a crime for anyone to promise a benefit made possible by an act of Congress as \u201cconsideration, favor, or reward for any political activity or for the support of or opposition to any candidate or any political party\u201d in connection with an election. According to the Justice Department, Section 600 is triggered when \u201ccorrupt public officials use government-funded jobs or programs to advance a partisan political agenda rather than to serve the public interest.\u201d Although a violation of Section 600 is a misdemeanor, the Justice Department says that in egregious cases it could support a felony charge for conspiracy to defraud the United States (by interfering with the fair and impartial administration of a federally funded program).\n\nIn other words, if the president, or other officials, tied the receipt of congressionally authorized military aid to Ukraine to Ukrainian help for the president\u2019s reelection campaign, that too could constitute a criminal offense. Such a scheme would echo a Nixon White House effort, dubbed the \u201cResponsiveness Program,\u201d to channel federal grants and contracts to groups or individuals who promised to support Nixon\u2019s reelection bid. The Senate Watergate Committee\u2019s report concluded that this diversion of taxpayer money from its intended use \u201cto the political goal of reelecting the President\u201d likely involved a criminal violation of the Hatch Act and a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nSo far, the Ukraine inquiry has focused on whether Trump improperly, or even illegally, solicited \u201cforeign interference\u201d in the 2020 presidential election. But the possibility that the president illegally directed improper election interference by U.S. officials is at least as disturbing, and it ought to be examined as part of the House investigation.\n\nAD", "description": "It\u2019s a felony to order federal government workers to further a partisan political campaign.", "authors": ["Gary Stein", "Gary Stein Is A Lawyer In New York", "A Former Federal Prosecutor In The U.S. Attorney S Office For The Southern District Of New York."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hXcAHpJUemJkh5nPbaCBzXrAtd4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EAGMIPHVEQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
