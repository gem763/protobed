Elizabeth Warren are both largely seen by their party as capable of pulling out a win next year against President Donald Trump, according to a national HuffPost/YouGov survey taken immediately after last week\u2019s primary debate.\n\nSixty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden is capable of winning the general election, with a virtually identical 59% saying the same of Warren. Polls taken after the previous three debates had given Biden an edge of between 6 points and 13 points on that metric. Roughly half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters currently think Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is capable of winning, with a third or fewer saying the same of any of the other candidates included in the survey.\n\nSixty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden is capable of winning the general election, a HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, with a virtually identical 59% saying the same of Warren.

In Quinnipiac\u2019s most recent survey, for instance, 48% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say Biden has the best chance of beating Trump, with just 21% saying the same of Warren.\n\nBut other polling also suggests that Biden is no longer the only candidate that most Democrats think is capable of pulling out a win. In last week\u2019s Economist/YouGov poll, two-thirds of Democratic primary voters thought Biden would probably beat Trump, with 55% saying Warren would probably win and 54% saying the same of Sanders.\n\nOther findings from the new HuffPost/YouGov survey:\n\nOverall, 59% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters now say they have a least a good idea of whom they\u2019ll vote for, up from 52% who said the same in September. About a third say they\u2019re still making up their minds. An 83% majority currently say they\u2019re at least satisfied with the 2020 Democratic field, with 45% describing themselves as enthusiastic.\n\nAs in previous surveys, Warren stands out as a potential consensus candidate, both garnering the broadest enthusiasm and causing the least consternation among members of her party. About half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters pick her as someone they\u2019d be enthusiastic to see nominated, with just 9% saying they\u2019d be upset. She\u2019s trailed most closely on this metric by Sanders (37% enthusiastic, 19% upset), Buttigieg (30% enthusiastic, 15% upset) and Biden (37% enthusiastic, 25% upset). Gabbard attracts the most resistance among the candidates included in the survey, with about a third saying they\u2019d be upset to have her as the nominee.\n\nAbout half of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters pick Elizabeth Warren as someone they'd be enthusiastic to see nominated, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll, with just 9% saying they'd be upset.
