However, a full copy of the document, leaked to Sky News, shows the missing words were \u201cby girly swot Cameron\u201d.\n\nThere was no apparent legal or security reason to remove the words, leading to the assumption it was done to minimise potential embarrassment to Johnson.\n\nIn past years the Commons would remain in recess without a break through summer until beyond the party conferences in mid-October. The brief sitting period was introduced and then abandoned under Labour, and resurrected by Cameron, amid complaints about the recess length.\n\nIt is not the first time Johnson has used the insult about the former prime minister. In 2013, when he was London mayor, Johnson called Cameron and his brother, Jo, \u201cgirly swots\u201d for gaining first-class degrees at university, when the current prime minister had to make do with a 2:1.\n\nEarlier this week Johnson was criticised after seeming to say, as Corbyn spoke during prime minister\u2019s question, \u201cCall an election, you great big girl\u2019s blouse.\u201d\n\nThe revelation of the latest insult prompted scorn from Labour MPs. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s like this particular cohort of Bullingdon Club and Old Etonians hit their emotional plateau before graduation from Oxford. Johnson and Rees-Mogg in particular see politics as a game.\u201d\n\nAlison McGovern, the Wirral South MP, tweeted: \u201c\u2018Big girl\u2019s blouse\u2019, \u2018Girly swot\u2019. What is it about big smart women Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t like?\u201d", "description": "Prime minister\u2019s comment in handwritten document condemned for sexist language", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/766cc0bc479a80acc91234f035f80ca180ad86bf/0_18_2617_1570/master/2617.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a776ff002480f2af7611d4b41aab8195", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
