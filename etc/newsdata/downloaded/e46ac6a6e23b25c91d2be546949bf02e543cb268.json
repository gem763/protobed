Thanks to not only the number of whales to see but also the sustainable practices of operators and respectful (ie. not all up in the poor whale\u2019s space) interactions that help protect these giant ocean creatures, Hervey Bay is now recognised as the best whale watching destination in the world.\n\nIn case you somehow weren\u2019t aware, the calm waters of Hervey Bay provide a perfect refuge for mama humpbacks migrating south to the Antartic with their brand new calves in tow. During the season \u2013 from August to October \u2013 they\u2019ll stop and rest here, making for some adorable and playful displays.\n\nYou may have almost missed this season, but time to start planning for the next one yeah?", "description": "Queensland's own Hervey Bay was just announced as the first ever World Whale Heritage Site by the World Cetacean Alliance (WCA).", "authors": ["Kassia Byrnes"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/hervey-bay-whale-heritage-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
