REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nSentiment for sterling is likely to remain fragile ahead of a meeting later on Friday where European Union officials may decide how long they will extend Britain\u2019s deadline to leave the EU beyond the current date of Oct. 31.\n\nAt this stage, an election looks unlikely because the main opposition Labour Party has withheld its support and other opposition parties have rejected the offer.\n\nHowever, the twists and turns of the Brexit process have proved too complex to predict, which is likely to discourage some investors from taking on excessive risk before the EU agrees a new deadline for the UK\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constructive on sterling in the mid-term, because we don\u2019t see a high chance for a general election,\u201d said Osamu Takashima, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup Global Markets Japan in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cMy personal concern is once political uncertainty lifts, people will focus more on the UK\u2019s economy, which is weakening. This could be a negative for sterling.\u201d\n\nThe pound fell 0.14% to $1.2841 in Asia on Friday. For the week, sterling was on course for a 1.18% decline versus the greenback, its biggest weekly decline since Sept. 27.\n\nSterling fell 0.1% to 86.49 pence per euro, on course for a 0.45% weekly decline.\n\nOpposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would wait to see what the EU decides on a Brexit delay before deciding on a general election.\n\nHowever, Corbyn also repeated he could only back an election when the risk of Johnson taking Britain out of the EU without a deal to smooth the transition was off the table.\n\nThe euro held steady at $1.1103 in Asia on Friday, on course for a 0.62% weekly decline.\n\nThe Ifo economic institute\u2019s closely-watched measure of German business sentiment due later on Friday is expected to weaken slightly in October, highlighting fears that Europe\u2019s largest economy is slipping into recession due to the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit.\n\nThe European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday after unveiling a big stimulus package last month, but there are concerns the ECB\u2019s firepower has largely been spent.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 97.688 but up 0.42% on the week. The U.S. currency held steady at 108.61 yen, on course for a 0.18% weekly advance.\n\nThe focus shifts next week to a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting ending Oct. 30 and a Bank of Japan meeting ending Oct. 31.\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates for a third time this year, but fixed income analysts say this is largely priced into the market.\n\nThe BOJ is leaning toward keeping policy on hold next week, but the decision is a close call as policymakers struggle with the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.", "description": "The British pound fell on Friday versus the dollar and the euro after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for an election cast yet more uncertainty over Britain's divorce from the European Union.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444681318&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O00R", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
