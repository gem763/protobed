Facebook said in a statement that \"a careful review found a violation of our hate speech policy.\" The Israeli prime minister's Facebook page was not affected.\n\nNetanyahu pinned blame on a campaign staffer, and said he didn't write it in a radio interview, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"This mistake was immediately fixed \u2014 I didn't write it,\" Netanyahu said. \"Do you think I really would write such a thing and then deny it? I'm a serious person. Not everything on my campaign page is edited by me.\"\n\nNetanyahu has recently relied on hardline rhetoric to muster additional support before Israelis head to the polls, which is expected to be a close race.
