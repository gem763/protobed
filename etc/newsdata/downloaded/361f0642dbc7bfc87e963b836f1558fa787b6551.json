(AP) - Grammy-winning singer Lauren Daigle reigned at the 50th annual Gospel Music Association\u2019s Dove Awards on Tuesday, winning artist of the year, song of the year and pop/contemporary album of the year.\n\nThe 28-year-old Louisiana-born artist was the leading nominee coming into the awards show, held in Nashville, Tennessee, and marks her second artist of the year win in just three years.\n\nHer 2018 album \u201cLook Up Child,\u201d debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 all-genre chart and has broken chart records for weeks atop the Top Christian Albums chart. She won song of the year for her multiplatinum and Grammy-winning crossover single \u201cYou Say,\u201d which has introduced her to much wider audiences in the last year.\n\n\u201cJust to see the support of so many people, it\u2019s really, really moving. It\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d Daigle said after winning song of the year.\n\nGrammy-winning gospel singer Kirk Franklin, who lives in Fort Worth, Texas, called for prayers during his acceptance speech after winning gospel artist of the year after a Fort Worth woman was killed by a police officer over the weekend, which has sparked outrage and calls for police accountability.\n\n\u201cA young girl by the name of Atatiana Jefferson was shot and killed in her home by a policeman and I am just asking that we send up prayers for her family and for his, and asking that we send up prayers for that 8-year-old little boy that saw that tragedy,\u201d said Franklin, who also won contemporary gospel recorded song of the year.\n\nThis is not the first time that Franklin has spoken on the Dove Awards stage about police brutality, but when he urged Christian artists to speak out about racial injustice on the same awards show in 2016, his speech was edited when it was later broadcast on Trinity Broadcast Network.\n\nFranklin told The Associated Press after the awards show that he\u2019s never been reluctant to speak about political topics, even President Donald Trump, who he has criticized for his immigration policies. He called it his responsibility as a Christian artist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be quick to say that my heart is broken by the leadership of our president, that my heart is broken that he does not reflect any of the fruits of the spirit,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cWe do have the responsibility, the same responsibility that Dr. King had when he marched.\u201d\n\nFranklin added: \u201cThis president does not reflect the spirit of a Christian.\u201d\n\nGabriel Alberto Azucena, who goes by the stage name GAWVI, won rap/hip hop recorded song of the year along with hip hop artist Lecrae for their song \u201cFight For Me\u201d and Lecrae and Zaytoven won rap/hip hop album of the year for their collaborative album \u201cLet the Trap Say Amen.\u201d\n\nFor King and Country, made up of Australian born-brothers Joel and Luke Smallbone, won pop/contemporary recorded song of the year for \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d Joel Smallbone said that the song, which was recently re-recorded as a duet version with country superstar Dolly Parton, felt like \u201ca gift from God.\u201d\n\nThe Dove Awards showed highlights from previous years including performances by Whitney Houston, Dolly Parton and DC Talk to honor the show\u2019s 50th anniversary, and the presenters and performers included longtime gospel music leaders like Bill Gaither, Shirley Caesar and Pat Boone.\n\n__\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://doveawards.com/\n\n__\n\nFollow Kristin M.
