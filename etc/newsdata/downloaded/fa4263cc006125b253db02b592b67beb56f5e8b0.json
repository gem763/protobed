Companies can get up to 40 points on the B-BBEE scorecard if they invest in the enterprise and supplier development of qualifying small businesses.\n\n\n\nWhat do business incubators offer?\n\n\n\nAll businesses go through different stages \u2013 getting the idea (ideation), starting up, settling, growing, stabilising and growing further. There seems to be a support programme for every stage. However, finding the right fit is critical for success.\n\n\n\nMany entrepreneurs find it quite daunting to embark on their business journey, because it becomes quite lonely, says Jenny Retief, CEO of the Riversands Incubation Hub.\n\nRiversands was launched in 2015 through a private-public partnership between Century Property Developments and National Treasury\u2019s Jobs Fund.\n\nEstablished and start-up small businesses are accommodated at Riversands for a period of up to three years in subsidised premises with access to business support services. The Riversands hub offers mini-factories, workshops and offices at subsidised rates.\n\nAnother model is that of the co-creative hub, such as Jozihub, where entrepreneurs can rent a desk with connectivity, or get assistance with the organising of events, workshops, meetings or conferences. It provides a \u201chang-out\u201d for like-minded people, sometimes for free, but mostly at an hourly, daily or monthly fee.\n\nRaizcorp takes an equity stake only in companies within their Partner Elite stable. Their Arize division, which represents the majority of Raizcorp's business, does not take an equity stake at all.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t mean that they take over the day-to-day running of the business. They do offer backroom support that many small businesses struggle to afford when they are on their own.\n\nFinding the right fit\n\nIn a working paper presented by experts from Fetola \u2013 an SME specialist firm \u2013 it is noted that one of the key ingredients for a robust incubator model is the selection of the right candidates.\n\n\u201cSuccessful business incubation and enterprise development is firstly dependent on the quality and commitment of the entrepreneurs themselves,\u201d the authors say. \u201cSuccessful results are, more often than not, only achievable if participants are appropriately matched to the incubation programme itself.\u201d\n\nRetief agrees that the \u201cpre-selection process\u201d is critical. Entrepreneurs must carefully consider where their businesses are, what their needs are and if they comply, or want to comply, with the rules and conditions to become part of an incubator programme.\n\n\u201cBeing part of a high-energy community of entrepreneurs is a big reason why start-ups or early stage businesses want to move into an incubator hub. They love being around other entrepreneurs, sharing, learning and encouraging each other. It can be a very lonely journey otherwise.\u201d\n\nConducive environments\n\nAccording to Fetola, the biggest challenge for business support programmes is to create a \u201cconducive environment\u201d for sustainable growth and the creation of lifetime jobs.\n\nTherefore, the role of incubation is particularly important.\n\nAt Riversands entrepreneurs are allocated to a service coordinator, similar to a relationship manager at a bank. The coordinator puts them in contact with experts who can assist with financial and operational services as well as strategy and leadership guidance.\n\nThe concept is to offer the services initially for free or for a small co-payment, but eventually the company will be charged for the service. The expectation is for the business to grow in order to function without the aid of the incubator.\n\n\u201cOur role in creating jobs is by growing large numbers of small businesses. If these businesses, and especially black-owned businesses, grow successfully, it will make a huge difference to the inclusiveness, growth and productive capacity of our economy. That is our return on investment,\u201d says Retief.\n\nThey require the businesses to submit monthly statistics to determine whether, as an incubator, they are achieving their goal.\n\nMost incubators offer training and resources that would otherwise not be available to an SME. Support services can make a significant difference in an SME\u2019s success. Many entrepreneurs tend to struggle with issues such as strategic planning, costing and pricing, sales and marketing, finance for business leaders and labour law.\n\nHowever, Fetola warns against the role the incubator plays in facilitating opportunities for greater access to markets as it may create a dependence on the incubator\u2019s involvement in the business.\n\nTime to go\n\nMany non-profit incubators allow for a support period of three years for a company to grow from a fledgling, early stage business to becoming an independent, sustainable business.\n\nRetief says they see themselves as a stepping stone and springboard. In principle, the subsidised lease agreement is not renewed beyond the initial three years, or at times it is not renewed after one year.\n\n\u201cWe have the duty to make sure that when we invest in our subsidised square meters it is truly unlocking growth and movement towards independent viability. If we do not do that we are failing in our moral and stated mission and obligations,\u201d says Retief.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the 26 September edition of finweek magazine.
