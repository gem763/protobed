On Saturday against the Carolina Hurricanes, they led, 2-0, after two periods before losing, 3-2, in overtime. On Tuesday they led the Dallas Stars, 2-1, after two periods only to fall, 4-3, in overtime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening a couple different ways where momentum is being turned in the oppositions\u2019 favor,\u201d Capitals Coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cBut it is really, from us, the play with the puck, when you have the lead it is not giving ourselves a chance to have success and in turn we\u2019re giving up way too many chances. A lot of failure to execute.\u201d\n\nThe Predators\u2019 push came after they had already drawn even from a 4-2 deficit to start the period. They trimmed the margin to one goal on Ryan Johansen\u2019s second goal of the night at the 5:03 mark, a power-play tally after defenseman John Carlson took a hooking penalty. The equalizer came from center Matt Duchene at the 6:13 mark.\n\nMomentarily, it looked like the Capitals would regain control, with T.J. Oshie scoring off an assist by Dmitry Orlov to push Washington back on top, 5-4, at the 10:09 mark. But the Predators were not done writing this game\u2019s final chapter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn a sense we are beating ourselves and the other teams just aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cWe are turning pucks over and we\u2019re playing a system this year where it takes five guys skating and when you aren\u2019t skating as fast back to our end as fast as you are to theirs, then there can be holes in it, and that is obviously getting exploited right now with odd-man rushes and it\u2019s things we have to clean up.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals played without defenseman Michal Kempny (hamstring), whose timetable is remains up in the air. He has not yet been ruled out for Saturday\u2019s game at Dallas. And as they head to Dallas, Washington will have to once again regroup, looking for any way to improve their flailing play down the stretch of games.\n\nThrough 40 minutes, the Capitals (2-1-2) were doing everything right, with strong special teams play in the second period. Alex Ovechkin\u2019s second power play goal of the game came about five minutes after forward Tom Wilson scored on a shorthanded goal on a two-on-one rush at the 12:28 mark of the second period, giving the Capitals a 4-2 lead. It was Wilson\u2019s first goal of the season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilson had to temporarily leave the game in the third period to \u201cget evaluated,\u201d according to Reirden after a big hit. He returned to the ice with just over a minute remaining in the third period, but the Capitals missed his presence as the Predators scored their fifth, and game-tying goal, with winger Carl Hagelin filling in for Wilson on the Capitals\u2019 top-line.\n\nOvechkin\u2019s first power-play score of the night broke a 1-1 tie at the 4:46 mark of the second period with his signature one-timer. That marked Ovechkin\u2019s first career goal against Predators goalie Pekka Rinne. Ovechkin, who has tallied 661 career goals, has now scored a goal against 135 different NHL goaltenders and with that goal against Rinne, surpassed Luc Robitaille for the most power-play goals in NHL history with 249.\n\nThursday, in a game of firsts, center Lars Eller scored his first goal of the season, getting things going for Capitals with an early first period goal at the 9:17 mark in the first. Carlson recorded his first assist of the night on Eller\u2019s goal, then tallied two more in the second period. Through five games, Carlson now has one goal and seven assists.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe got greedy with how well our first was tonight,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cIt was really just missed assignments, not getting on the forecheck enough and there was, my line especially, I think we were out there for three goals against and if you want to be a good line you can\u2019t be giving up that many.\u201d\n\nPredators forward Filip Forsberg tied the game 1-1 just over a minute after Eller\u2019s opening tick, scoring for the fourth time in four games with his slick finish at the net off a smooth pass from Duchene. The Capitals were caught in the neutral zone off a turnover, leaving the path clear for the Predators. Forsberg\u2019s goal established a franchise record for the longest season-opening goal streak. While the Capitals let the Predators back in the game after Johansen tied the game 2-2, answering Ovechkin\u2019s first power play goal.\n\nIn a back-and-forth game all night, the Capitals\u2019 saw bright spots within their fourth-line, with Garnet Hathaway and Brendan Leipsic all over the ice for Washington. Even though it\u2019s still a small sample size five games into the season, with Leipsic\u2019s speed and aggressiveness combined with Hathaway\u2019s physicality and ability to create, the pair have provided a needed boost to the Washington\u2019s bottom-six forwards. Reirden proceeded to shift the lines a couple times Thursday night, moving Leipsic up on the second line due to his positive play \u2014 once for Oshie late in the first period and another time for forward Jakub Vrana early in the second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find something that works,\u201d Reirden said. \u2018Some players, you have them miss a few shifts because you haven\u2019t liked how things have gone and you give another guy that\u2019s going well, you give him a jolt to let him know to keep doing the things he is doing. That will have ebbs and flows to how those guys will take advantage of those opportunities and whether we continue to keep those combinations or not, we will review the film.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Braden Holtby gives up four goals, and the Capitals lose for the third straight time after taking a lead into the third period.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/snnxugeZBWz-PmhDca_CEU0zW4A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6QVPNKHL3AI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
