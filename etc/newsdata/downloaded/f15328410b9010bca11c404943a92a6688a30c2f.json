The Dow Jones Industrial Average was more than 1% away from its life high.\n\n\"We are going to maybe trade up a little bit higher in the short term and (pull back) after the earnings season and the rate cut,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Monday he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule but did not elaborate on the timing.\n\nThat added to Friday's optimism when Washington said it was \"close to finalizing\" some parts of a trade agreement with China.\n\nThe news comes as a relief to investors who have been reeling from the impact of the trade war and its fallout on the domestic economy.\n\nAdding to the upbeat mood, the Fed is expected to widely cut interest rates at its two-day policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday.\n\nThe odds for a quarter percentage point cut in U.S. borrowing costs have jumped to 94% from 49% last month, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\n\"One of the reasons they are cutting interest rates is not because they are trying to get ahead of a slowdown but because they are worried about the impact of the trade and tariff issues,\" Pavlik said.\n\nThe third-quarter earnings season has managed to ease some concerns related to the impact of the trade tensions on Corporate America, with over 78% of the 204 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 2%, but excluding the energy sector, they are forecast to rise 0.5%.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for earnings from heavyweights this week, including Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc and Merck & Co Inc.\n\nAt 11:19 a.m., ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 107.46 points, or 0.40%, at 27,065.52, the S&P 500 was up 15.54 points, or 0.51%, at 3,038.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 67.92 points, or 0.82%, at 8,311.04.\n\nAmong other stocks, AT&T Inc rose about 5% after the U.S. wireless carrier said it would add two new board members and consider selling off up to $10 billion worth of non-core businesses next year.\n\nTiffany & Co surged about 31% after Louis Vuitton owner LVMH made a $120 per share offer to buy the U.S. luxury jeweler.\n\nSpotify Technology SA jumped about 16% after the music streaming company posted a surprise quarterly profit and beat revenue estimates.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.54-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.17-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and 26 new lows.
