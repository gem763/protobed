He calls on Palestinians to seek \"martyrdom\" by attacking Israelis with a suicide vest in response.\n\nAl-Zawahiri, an Egyptian, became leader of al Qaeda following the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan by U.S. Navy SEALs. He is believed to be hiding somewhere in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. A July report by the U.N. cited reports that he is \"in poor health\" but provided no details.\n\nOver recent years, al Qaeda has been engaged in fending off competition in jihadi circles from its rival, the Islamic State group. ISIS exploded into prominence by seizing large swaths of Iraq and Syria in 2014, declaring a \"caliphate\" and extending affiliates in multiple countries across the region.\n\nISIS's physical \"caliphate\" was crushed in Iraq and Syria, though its militants are still active and carrying out attacks.\n\nThe U.N. report said the \"immediate global threat posed by al Qaeda remains unclear\" but warned that some would-be ISIS recruits could turn to older organization.\n\nAl Qaeda militants, meanwhile, have taken a lower profile, using regional conflicts in Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen to entrench themselves. The Yemen branch has been the most active, exploiting the chaos of the civil war to carry out bombings, shootings and assassinations in an effort to expand its footprint.\n\nOsama bin Laden's son Hamza bin Laden had been viewed as an eventual heir to the leadership of al-Qaida but was killed in a military operation, U.S. officials have said. Al-Zawahiri lauded Hamza in a 2015 video that appeared on jihadi websites, calling him a \"lion from the den of al Qaeda.\"\n\nThe new video was released as President Trump unleashed threats against militants contemplating another attack on America.\n\n\"If anyone dares to strike our land, we will respond with the full measure of American power and the iron will of the American spirit and that spirit is unbreakable,\" Mr. Trump said at the Pentagon.", "description": "Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri calls on Muslims to attack U.S., European, Israeli and Russian targets in a speech on the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/07/01/ed701482-915e-48c1-81bf-bde11c63974e/thumbnail/1200x630/b320406cc3e6d85a25cd4f036d7652d9/aymanalzawahri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
