I had the indignity of appearing harassed and tired even when happy and well-rested.\n\nBut not for much longer, I hoped, because I was about to start using The Cream.\n\nThe Cream commands the definitive article, because it is, apparently, the definitive face cream. And it has a matching price tag \u2014 a palpitation-inducing \u00a3205 for 50ml.\n\nSince it launched, quietly, last year, The Cream has become a cult product, slowly acquiring celebrity fans. Demi Moore, Naomi Campbell, Victoria Beckham, Amber Valletta, Courteney Cox, Carla Bruni, Kate Bosworth and Leonardo DiCaprio (yes, really) have enthused about it.\n\nAugustinus Bader's The Cream has become a must-have skincare product, after being developed from a wound cream for burn victims\n\nSo what could justify this mighty fuss, and even mightier cost? Certainly, The Cream has a remarkable pedigree. Its inventor is one of the world\u2019s leading biomedical scientists, Professor Augustinus Bader. He is the director and professor of applied stem cell biology and cell technology at Leipzig University in Germany.\n\nThe Cream evolved from a wound cream the professor developed following decades of clinical experience and research, which reduces scar formation in burn victims.\n\nWhen it didn\u2019t sell to pharmaceutical firms (he suspects it wasn\u2019t deemed profitable enough), colleagues persuaded him to apply his expertise to skincare and, as he tells me, \u2018age-related changes\u2019.\n\nThe Cream, resplendent in a blue and bronze bottle, contains amino acids, minerals, medical-grade vitamins and synthesised molecules, otherwise known as the patented TFC8 complex.\n\nThis formula boosts collagen production and the cell renewal process, which slows as we age, thereby \u2018dramatically improving the complexion\u2019s appearance\u2019.\n\nAs we get older, the skin starts to appear duller. Our genetic clock gives us \u2018reduced access to our own repair capacities,\u2019 says Professor Bader. \u2018Why not help restart this repair process with the signals that are innate to us and utilise them?\u2019\n\nEpigenetics tells us that how we age is 30 per cent dependent on our genes, he adds, \u2018but 70 per cent is what you do with them. So, just like you eat good food and exercise, why not find out the nutrients, the molecules that your stem cells need to fix your skin? And I think I found some of them.\u2019\n\nProfessor Bader recommends using The Cream for everything. Cleansing. Exfoliating. Removing make-up. Washing up. All right, not washing up, but the idea of rinsing this precious stuff off my face feels just as profligate. I might as well poke fivers down the plug.\n\nAnna Maxted (pictured) gave her verdict on The Cream - best for combination to oily skin, after using it for around two weeks\n\nStill, sacrifices must be made in the name of research.\n\nThe Cream simplifies my beauty routine, which is already less rigorous than it might be.\n\nI use facial oil and a good moisturiser. Toners and cleansers dry my skin, so I normally splash my face with water and exfoliate only in an emergency. But now all these products are banned for a month. I\u2019m only allowed to slather myself in The Cream \u2014 best for combination to oily skin \u2014 and The Rich Cream, for normal to dry skin. Not exactly a hardship.\n\nTo begin with, I use The Cream, as I don\u2019t want to overload my skin (which is temperamental \u2014 both oily and dry).\n\nIt is light, absorbs beautifully, and feels deliciously nourishing. It contains aloe vera, amino acids and vitamins A, B, C and E, and is rich in antioxidants.\n\nIf I use it as recommended, my bottle of The Cream should last a mere six weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s \u00a34.88 a day so, to justify it, I\u2019ll have to sell the cat or my youngest child.\n\nBut, Professor Bader tells me, because The Cream triggers your innate skin repair processes, the more you use it, the stronger your skin becomes.\n\nIt\u2019s good news if your budget isn\u2019t limitless. Use The Cream for four weeks before returning to your normal routine, and any gains aren\u2019t lost. \u2018What you reach, you keep,\u2019 he says.\n\nAnna says her skin had a subtle improvement after trying The Cream, Professor Bader claims results vary according to each person's genetic code\n\nFor two weeks, I rub it in, wash it off, re-apply it lavishly. My skin is instantly rendered soft and plump. But when I study my reflection after a week to ten days, I struggle to see a difference. Then, around day 15, a friend says I look \u2018glowing\u2019.\n\nI ask a beautician colleague what she thinks of my skin. \u2018Very good,\u2019 she says. \u2018Just a little dryness around the nose.\u2019 The next day, though I\u2019m bare-faced, it looks as if I\u2019m wearing a light foundation.\n\nStill, as my skin is deemed a little dry, I switch to The Rich Cream. It\u2019s aptly named. Unctuous and thick, it bestows immediate luminosity. I keep looking suspiciously at myself, but at day 22, I genuinely think my skin looks more youthful.\n\nAt the month\u2019s end, I consult that fearless critic, my husband. What does he think of my skin? \u2018It\u2019s good at the moment. You haven\u2019t got any red bits.\u2019\n\nYet the improvement is fairly subtle. Can it take longer than 27 days to see a marked difference? There is variability, says Professor Bader, \u2018as everyone has a different genetic code, environmental exposure, and way of life\u2019. And, naturally, \u2018there are limits\u2019.\n\n\u2018The Cream tries to give you the best skin based on your genetic code,\u2019 he says. \u2018It\u2019s not super-human!\u2019\n\nCULT SKINCARE FAVOURITES\n\naugustinusbader.com", "description": "Anna Maxted gave her verdict on Augustinus Bader's The Cream.
