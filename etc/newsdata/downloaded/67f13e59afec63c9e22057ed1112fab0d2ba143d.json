Boomers may scoff at millennials, and millennials may disdain them back. \"Seinfeld\" and \"Friends\" fans may fight it out online about the crucial question of which is the better sitcom.\n\nBut ... lay a hand on \"The Princess Bride\"?\n\nBOOM!\n\nYou heard that, right?\n\nYes, you heard that right!\n\nThat's the sound of a mass, multi-generational consensus going \"NOOOOOOOO!\" --exploding across social media like a neutron bomb over the offhand implication by a Hollywood studio head in an article in Variety that somebody somewhere is thinking of remaking Rob Reiner's classic 1987 fairy tale movie.\n\nPhotos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Cary Elwes and Robin Wright starred in \"The Princess Bride,\" which celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017. Screenwriter William Goldman adapted his 1973 fantasy-quest novel for the Rob Reiner film. Here's what the cast has been up to in the three decades since the cult favorite's release: Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Actor Cary Elwes, who played \"The Princess Bride's\" chivalrous Westley, granted us our wish of a \"Princess Bride\" memoir called -- what else? -- \"As You Wish.\" The book chronicles the movie's creation and takes readers behind the scenes of some classic moments. Aside from his work as an author, Elwes is also busy in film and TV, including a stint voicing Dr. Watson on Fox's \"Family Guy.\" Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? To play Princess Buttercup in 1987's \"The Princess Bride,\" Robin Wright's acting process \"was mostly telling myself, 'Don't be an idiot,' \" she jokes to Town and Country magazine . Since then, she's built an award-winning career, including her role on Netflix's \"House of Cards.\" Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Mandy Patinkin has been playing \"Homeland's\" Saul Berenson to great acclaim since 2011, but he'll always be vengeful swordsman Inigo Montoya to us. (And that word still doesn't mean what you think it means .) Patinkin starred in Zach Braff's 2014 indie comedy, \"Wish I Was Here.\" Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Chris Sarandon's Prince Humperdinck never stood a chance against Elwes' Westley in the eyes of Princess Buttercup (and his vindictive evil plan didn't help). Luckily, the actor's gotten more love in his acting career since and appeared in a 2011 remake of his 1985 classic, \"Fright Night.\" Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Wallace Shawn's such a beloved actor, it's inconceivable to pick a favorite role. But his turn as the evil mastermind with a poor vocabulary, Vizzini, is definitely in our top three. Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Christopher Guest is known for his comedic skill, which he showed as Count Tyrone in \"The Princess Bride\" (as well as cult classics \"This Is Spinal Tap\" and \"Best in Show\"). Most recently, he starred on HBO's short-lived comedy \"Family Tree.\" Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Since he played the adorable grandson being told the story of \"The Princess Bride,\" Fred Savage has slowly transitioned to doing more work behind the camera. After starring on \"The Wonder Years\" from 1988 to 1993, Savage has directed TV shows such as \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" and \"Party Down.\" Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? After playing the Albino, English actor Mel Smith mostly appeared on British TV. Before he died in 2013, he appeared in the critically praised BBC drama \"Dancing on the Edge.\" Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Billy Crystal's magical sense of humor was put to good use as Miracle Max, who knows a medicine man is only as good as the woman behind him. Crystal has been incredibly prolific since his role in the 1987 movie. Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Carol Kane played Miracle Max's wife, Valerie, and helps him realize that he lost his confidence. But Kane's work extends far beyond \"The Princess Bride,\" including her work in the musical \"Wicked\" and TV appearances on shows such as \"Girls\" and \"Law and Order: SVU.\" Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Andre the Giant's day job was as a wrestler, but he was also known as Vizzini's rhyming criminal assistant, Fezzik. Sadly, he passed away six years after starring in the Rob Reiner film. Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? \"Columbo\" star Peter Falk was the grandfather many \"Princess Bride\" fans wished they could adopt, because at the very least you would be in for awesome storytelling. The award-winning actor died at age 83 in 2011. Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: 'The Princess Bride': Where are they now? Prolific British actress Margery Mason was introduced to \"Princess Bride\" fans as the tart Ancient Booer who sets Princess Buttercup straight on the concept of true love. Before her death at age 100 in January 2014, Mason also appeared in \"Love Actually,\" \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" and the live-action \"101 Dalmatians.\" Hide Caption 14 of 14\n\n\"I want their names!\" one Tweeter exclaimed, demanding that whoever would even imagine making a better movie out of the late William Goldman's greatest screenplay should be dragged into the court of public ridicule. Original cast member Cary Elwes (hot farm boy turned pirate) joined the loud chorus. \"There's a shortage of perfect movies in the world,\" Elwes tweeted, quoting (more or less) his character. \"It would be a pity to damage this one.\"\n\nTerrible idea, of course. But let's pause.\n\nOne wonders where all this accumulated outrage was when, say, the Disney people were inclined to bring back \"Mary Poppins\" for a sequel last year. Or, for that matter, when somebody thought it was a good idea to make live-action film versions of Disney musicals such as \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017), \"Aladdin\" (last May) and \"The Lion King\" (July) when we were getting along just fine with both the classic animated originals and their Broadway stage versions.\n\nIs this noisy, near-unanimous uproar over the prospect of a revamped \"Princess Bride\" a much-needed, long-overdue shot across Hollywood's bow? Enough with the retreads already?\n\nJUST WATCHED Ted Cruz does \"Princess Bride\" and totally nails it Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ted Cruz does \"Princess Bride\" and totally nails it 01:11\n\nUnfortunately, good luck with that: those Disney remakes, for example, have made enough money to convince the rest of the movie industry that familiarity can be profitable. But \"Princess Bride?\" You know what else familiarity is? Familiar -- which turns into boring, then gets unprofitable. ( \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" anybody? ) Hollywood studio chiefs might ponder that.\n\nMaybe instead of reaching back and plucking cherished properties, they might want to come up with some new stories and ideas on their own. I know how hard that is today, given that novelists and screenwriters like the late William Goldman -- whose \"Princess Bride\" script was, by general consensus, his masterwork -- are harder to find.\n\n\"Princess Bride\" was based on one of Goldman's novels; he also wrote the screenplay. He also wrote the screenplays for (his own) \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" as well as Woodward and Bernstein's \"All the President's Men,\" among many others, and was accomplished as a playwright as well.\n\nOne heard from older scriptwriters and directors as far back as 1987, when \"Princess Bride\" came out, that younger screenwriters were leaning less on books for inspiration and instead draw on their DVDs of movies and television shows for ideas. Can anybody imagine something like \"Princess Bride\" coming from such sensibilities?\n\nOK, it's \"inconceivable!\" as Wallace Shawn's shiny-headed, overbearing princess-snatcher Vizzini keeps shouting, as if he meant to launch a thousand gifs and memes . The puzzled response to him from Mandy Patinkin's vengeance-obsessed Spanish henchman, Inigo Montoya, is by now also deeply embedded in the meme-erverse: \"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\"\n\n\"Princess Bride\" is, if not perfect, darned near inimitable. It rewards re-viewing as few others of its era, with Goldman dialogue that you thought you'd forgotten from the last several dozen viewings. Did I, or you, remember that Robin Wright (hot princess) with a straight face actually tossed off the initials \"R.O.U.S.\" as shorthand when describing \"Rodents Of Unusual Size\" to her pirate rescuer (a.k.a. Westley farm boy)\n\nAnd can anyone forget Billy Crystal as kvetching wizard Miracle Max and Carol Kane as Witch Valerie cheerfully waving as Westley, Inigo and Fezzik (the late, great Andr\u00e9 the Giant) leave their wizard lair: \"Have fun storming the castle!\" We could go on an on.\n\nSo we're all agreed, right? \"Princess Bride\" should be left as is, in its own time and place to hand down like an heirloom of its time.\n\nA sequel? Don't even -- unless you want, or need, a louder explosion.\n\nThis article is updated to correct the spelling of the farm boy character in \"The Princess Bride\". It is Westley.", "description": "So we're all agreed, right? \"Princess Bride\" should be left as is, and not remade, says Gene Seymour -- a singular classic in its own time and place, meant to be handed down like an heirloom to future generations.", "authors": ["Opinion Gene Seymour"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/121004102107-the-princess-bride-still-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
