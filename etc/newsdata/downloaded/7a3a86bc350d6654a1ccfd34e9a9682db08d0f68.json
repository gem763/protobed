Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nIn honour of World Dumpling Day on Sept 26, three Singapore eateries decided to swap out the meat in their dumplings for plant-based protein instead.\n\nThe restaurants \u2013 Dumpling Darlings, Sum Yi Tai and Chi Kinjo \u2013 unveiled their new creations on Thursday, featuring \u2018meat\u2019 made with heme (soybean protein) from producer Impossible Foods.\n\nFrom an initial eight restaurants in March, Impossible Foods now supplies its plant-based meat to over 300 eateries here \u2013 and demand continues to increase, according to its global expansion director Jordan Sadowsky.\n\nHe added that the company wanted to show that, apart from the more common burger option, the product could also be used in Asian cuisine.\n\nBusiness Insider tried the new dumplings to see if we could tell the difference \u2013 and were blown away instead by how much they tasted like meat.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\nThree eateries here are now selling dumplings made with Impossible meat, a plant-based protein, one of which is specialty shop Dumpling Darlings on 44 Amoy Street.\n\ncaption Their new dumplings cost S$10 for a plate of five. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nThe \u2018Curry Momo\u2019 had a strong Middle-Eastern flavour, which might stump people expecting Chinese-style dumplings.\n\ncaption It tasted exactly like the Impossible meat option served at kebab chain Stuff\u2019d. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nNot meat? I absolutely couldn\u2019t tell \u2013 and even better, it didn\u2019t have any of the annoying fatty bits or chewy sinew.\n\ncaption It was filled with charred cauliflower and onions. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nThe second eatery I visited was Sum Yi Tai, an 80\u2019s, Hong Kong-inspired bar on 25 Boon Tat Street.\n\ncaption Their dumplings cost S$14 for six. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nThe Chinese-style mala dumplings here had a double whammy of szechuan spice in the filling, and mala sauce on the side. The burning aftertaste was no joke, but it did whet the appetite.\n\ncaption The filling had watercress and onions. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nThe crispy, piping-hot dumplings were easily the best of the three, and made for superb pub food.\n\nI was so focused on the taste, I forgot they weren\u2019t even made of real meat.\n\ncaption So juicy. So crispy. So spicy. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nThe last eatery I visited was Japanese bar Chi Kinjo on 29 Stanley Street.\n\ncaption Here, it\u2019s $15 for six dumplings. source Facebook/Chi Kinjo\n\nTheir \u201cImpossible Encounter\u201d gyoza were the lightest and the juiciest of the three.\n\nJuice from the filling literally spilled out when I took a bite, like a xiao long bao.\n\ncaption Inside was tofu and carrots. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nNo matter how I inspected the filling, I just couldn\u2019t believe the gyoza didn\u2019t contain meat.\n\nIt didn\u2019t have the floury taste and rubbery texture of mock meat, and could definitely fool most people.\n\ncaption source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nThe best dumpling was still the mala one: it was most flavourful, and a good place to start for those who want to try out plant-based meat without blowing S$30 on a burger off the bat.\n\ncaption But at over $2 a pop, these dumplings still aren\u2019t cheap, though Impossible said it\u2019s working to reduce the price of its plant-based meat so even hawkers can use it. source Business Insider/Rachel Chia\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - So juicy.
