But barely any live in Green Bank, West Virginia. That\u2019s because it\u2019s illegal there.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nResearchers think it could block signals from outer space.\n\nThe tiny town of fewer than 150 people doesn\u2019t tout huge shopping plazas or apartment complexes. It doesn\u2019t even have cellular service, according to Popular Mechanics.\n\nBut it is home to something massive: the Green Bank Observatory, regarded as one of the world\u2019s most important facilities for astronomic research. Opened in 1958, it sits offroad in a quaint, grassy valley, tucked away behind the spiraling Allegheny Mountains.\n\nInside are a number of high-tech devices, including the world\u2019s largest steerable radio telescope, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank. And in the past six decades, the facility has made some groundbreaking discoveries, like black holes, pulsars and radiation belts.\n\nIn September, it found the biggest neutron star ever detected.\n\nStars and space aren\u2019t the only thing researchers are looking for there, though. The observatory is also where serious data for extraterrestrial intelligence is collected. And that\u2019s why officials want to stop residents from interfering with research by using Wi-Fi.\n\n\u201cThe signals we detect from space are extremely faint,\u201d Harshal Gupta, the National Science Foundation program officer for the Green Bank Observatory, told Popular Mechanics. \u201cA source of man-made radiofrequency can overwhelm these signals.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission established the National Radio Quiet Zone in 1958 in an effort to limit radio-frequency interference, covering about 13,000 square miles. That meant radio towers, television antennas and heavy machinery were restricted nearby, and private citizens weren\u2019t allowed to use radio equipment too close to the towers.\n\nThat law is still in effect. But it isn\u2019t easy to enforce.\n\nWhile many establishments in the town are connected to the Internet, they use physical Ethernet cords instead of connecting wirelessly. The same can\u2019t be said for everyone.\n\nJulie Shiflet of Green Bank Elementary-Middle School said her students often connect to the Internet remotely: \u201cI asked 22 eighth graders, \u2018How many of you have [WiFi and Bluetooth] electronics?\u2019 All of them raised their hands. Then, I asked how many of them have music and headphones for their devices. All but one raised their hands.\u201d\n\nAside from Shiflet\u2019s students, the Pew Research Center noted that 96 U.S. adults own cell phones and 81 percent own smartphones. And a growing number of Americans own smart in-home devices and accessories to complement their phones.\n\nThen, there are people who purposely ignore the law, installing hotspots in their homes and businesses. A convenience store not far from Green Bank Elementary has remote access. When told about interference, the clerk said, \u201cYeah, but everyone\u2019s got WiFi now.\u201d\n\nDANGEROUS DRONES: WHY FLYING ROBOTS ARE WEAPONS AND HOW TO STOP THEM\n\nThere\u2019s a $50 fine for violators, plus another $50 each day they don\u2019t comply, but Chuck Niday, an observatory engineer, said it isn\u2019t enforced much: \u201cWe just make a note of it and go on.\u201d The lack of cell service and limited radio use can make it difficult to police.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe observatory is looking into some workarounds. Educating the public has been one method to curb Wi-Fi use, and another is RFI excision techniques, which could remove interference in real-time before the scientific data is recorded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The law has been hard to enforce.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
