He drew the sharpest distinctions yet between him and the rest of the still crowded field, and gave voters a preview of the fight he might bring to a one-on-one debate with Donald Trump.\n\nHis pushback at Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s attack on what she labeled a bipartisan \u201cregime change\u201d foreign policy was the first sustained case any of the Democrats have offered in defense of an activist foreign policy\u2014a case buttressed by Buttigieg\u2019s military service.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence,\u201d he said, turning to Gabbard, who herself served in the Army. \u201cIt\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values\u2026.A small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS. Meanwhile soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed\u2014ashamed of what their country has done. \u2026When I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word. You take that away, it takes away what makes America America.\u201d\n\nIn that single answer, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, folded in a defense of America\u2019s international role with a concise assault on Trump\u2019s invitation for Turkey to invade Syria. It was one of several instances where Buttigieg, lurking in the polls just below former Vice President Joe Biden and senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, made his strongest argument as a moderate alternative to front-running Biden, who, while avoiding rhetorical stumbles of past debates, seemed to fade into the scenery as the night went on.\n\nButtigieg, displaying a passion that many said was conspicuously lacking in his earlier appearances, punched up on the subject of the candidates\u2019 competing heath care plans. When Elizabeth Warren once again promised that \u201ccosts will go down\u201d for most Americans under her \u201cno private insurance\u201d idea, Buttigieg staked out an alternative that went to the heart of the political danger of a single-payer plan. He noted that Warren, like Bernie Sanders, repeatedly refused to acknowledge the fact that taxes will go up for the middle class, which they argued would be more than eased by an overall lowering of costs.\n\n\u201cA yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg chided. \u201cThis is why people are so frustrated. Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. We can move forward with the biggest transformation since Medicare. The way to do it without a giant multi-trillion-dollar hole and avoiding a yes or no question is Medicare for all who want it.\u201d\n\nAnd in what is sure to be among the most featured moments of the night, Buttigieg displayed a bit of temper in an exchange with former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls, the problem is the policy,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI don't need lessons from you on courage\u2014personal or political. The problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this. The problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress and we should be united in taking the fight to them\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat we owe to those survivors is a solution. We are at the cusp of building a new American majority to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire adult life. This is really important, okay? On guns we are this close to an assault weapons ban. And we're going to get wrapped around the axle whether it's \u2018Hell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your guns?\u2019\u201d\n\nIf I\u2019m right, Buttigieg will get the lion\u2019s share of the \u201cWho won?\u201d judgments, with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar earning high marks as the moderate voice of reason, and Sanders demonstrating no ill effects from his recent heart attack.\n\nBut this raises a more fundamental question: Will Buttigieg\u2019s performance matter in the only way that really matters\u2014a bump in the polls?\n\nWe have had one example of a much-heralded debate performance whose half-life proved non-existent. Kamala Harris\u2019 critique of Joe Biden\u2019s record on busing was the featured moment of the first debate. Her rise in the polls was followed by a steady return to single digits. Why? Perhaps it was her failure to explain exactly what her health care plan was; or that the distance between her and Biden on busing was shorter than first appeared; or that, in general the rationale for her campaign was less clear than her rivals. Whatever the cause, her one debate moment proved far too fragile to sustain a rise in support.\n\nLess obvious, but equally significant, was Joe Biden\u2019s continued presence at or near the top of the pack, despite three debates where he was heard wandering through a confusing rhetorical landscape of incomplete sentences, odd allusions and garbled statistics. His decades of experience, his ties to the still-wildly popular Obama, his strength among African-American politicians and voters, has thus far mattered more than his unsteady debate performances. And if you\u2019re looking for a debate \u201cmoment\u201d to account for Warren\u2019s steady rise in the polls, you won\u2019t find one. Instead, her overall debate presence has been characterized by a \u201cno drama\u201d offering of policies wrapped neatly around her striver\u2019s biography and stories she has gathered from people she\u2019s met on the trail.\n\nFor those of us whose professional lives revolve around politics\u2014who only checked on the Washington-St. Louis game during commercial breaks\u2014debates are often seen as high political drama, with enormous stakes. Every debate is viewed through the prism of the clashes leading up to a general election, even though we are three and a half months away from the first primary vote. And voters know this, which is why every survey shows a thumping majority of them say they either have no favorite or could change their minds.\n\nIf these debates matter as much as the coverage suggests they do, we should see some measurable movement in the polls. But even if we do, the more significant question is: Will that movement be sustained? Or are there other factors that will make the sound and fury of these debates underwhelming in the end?", "description": "If previous debate fireworks are any guide, probably not.", "authors": ["Jeff Greenfield"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/51/0f/401039ff4c768070a3c50a478cef/191015-buttigieg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
