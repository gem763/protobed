In a since-deleted Instagram post, Roufs said both fighters have \u201cprofessionally reached out personally to one another & have agreed to fight each other\u201d on a date to be determined.\n\nPettis and Cerrone fought in 2013 in a lightweight fight, with \u201cShowtime\u201d earning a first-round knockout after a brutal body kick to \u201cCowboy\u201d shut him down. Since then, both fighters have had big career trajectories.\n\nAfter stopping Cerrone, Pettis captured the lightweight title in his next fight by submitting then-champion Benson Henderson at UFC 164. Pettis defended his belt once against Gilbert Melendez before losing it to Rafael dos Anjos in March 2015. Including dos Anjos, Pettis is 4-7 in his last 11 fights, which included a move up to welterweight this year.\n\nCerrone, on the other hand, has fought 25 times since the loss to Pettis, which included a failed title bid against dos Anjos and a move to welterweight before dropping back down to lightweight this year.\n\nIn 2019, Pettis owns a knockout win over Stephen Thompson and lost a unanimous decision to Nate Diaz in August at UFC 241. Cerrone, who said his move back to 155 pounds was to make a serious run at the title, started off the year with wins over Alexander Hernandez and Al Iaquinta, followed by back-to-back TKO losses against Tony Ferguson and most recently Justin Gaethje last month at UFC on ESPN+ 16.", "description": "Anthony Pettis defeated Donald Cerrone in 2013 with a brutal body kick.
