You will probably feel pressured to answer politely, but here is another option: lie.\n\nYou can prepare your lies ahead of time, or let the moment inspire you. You can choose to be abruptly rude, or give a subtly uncomfortable answer. Every option is on the table, because seriously: strangers can just fuck off. (You can lie to friends and family members, too, but this is a more delicate situation.)\n\nFor example, here is what Anne Hathaway says when people ask her about baby names:\n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018Do you know the name?\u2019 And we go, \u2018Africa,\u2019 \u201d Hathaway said with a huge smile, pronouncing the first syllable with a resounding, \u201cAhh.\u201d \u201cAnd you make really intense, sincere eye contact and you don\u2019t look away and you don\u2019t blink,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd you have to watch them just squirm.\u201d\n\nFor a simpler lie, you can dodge the gender question by saying \u201cNope, we aren\u2019t finding out\u201d even if you already know. Make up a due date, and for fun it can be surprisingly near or far in the future.\n\nOr the best of all, which I never quite had the guts to use myself, but I wish I did: Just say \u201cHuh? I\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d", "description": "Show up in public with a pregnant-looking belly and suddenly everyone is all \u201cWhen are you due?\u201d and \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re having?\u201d, as if the contents of your uterus are somehow their business.
