It\u2019s a stark difference from the bright white screens that have dominated iOS for years and it\u2019s something that people have been wanting for a long time.\n\nYou can toggle between the themes manually through Control Center or by diving into the Settings app each time you want to change it, but thankfully Apple has provided a way for the phone to automatically switch between light and dark depending on the time of day or sunset and sunrise cycles. This way, you can have a lighter theme during the day when you\u2019re in brightly lit areas and then an easier-on-the-eyes dark theme for the evening and night time use.\n\nSetting up automatic switching is easy, though Apple doesn\u2019t prompt you to do it when you first install iOS 13 or set up a new phone. Here\u2019s how to get your iPhone to automatically change themes:\n\nMake sure your device is running iOS 13 or later (Settings > General > Software update on an iPhone 6S, iPad Air 2, or newer)\n\nOpen the Settings app and navigate to Display & Brightness\n\nToggle the Automatic setting under Appearance\n\nTap the Options button to set the Appearance Schedule\n\nChoose either Sunset to Sunrise, which uses your phone\u2019s location to change between light and dark appearance when the sun goes down, or set your own custom schedule\n\nThat\u2019s it, now your phone will automatically switch its appearance based on your schedule or the solar cycles.", "description": "iOS 13\u2019s most noticeable feature is a new dark theming mode.
