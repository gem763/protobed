Mogollon said the only larger farmers market organizations in the United States will be GrowNYC and the Pacific Coast Farmers Market Association.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new FreshFarm, Mogollon added, will not cut any staff, close farmers markets or shutter programs such as FreshFarm\u2019s FoodPrints food education initiative or Community Foodworks\u2019 signature Pop Up Food Hub, which distributes local produce to 52 organizations, including early-child-care providers and school garden programs.\n\n\u201cActually, both organizations are very complementary,\u201d Mogollon said. \u201cWe believe that having a strong organization is going to help us bring better services to all our farmers markets, so we could increase the opportunities for farmers.\u201d\n\nBut at least one farmer who works with FreshFarm said he worries that the merger might mean something else for both the organization and the farmers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to stay and who\u2019s going to go?\u201d wondered Mark Toigo, owner of Toigo Organic Farms. \u201cBecause the only reason I see why people [merge] is to, quite frankly, get rid of the fat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYet, according to Ann Yonkers, co-founder of FreshFarm, the organization wasn\u2019t looking for a merger. Mogollon suggested the idea to FreshFarm when he saw the organization was searching for a new executive director. The two organizations had worked together on some initiatives and have similar missions. A merger could assist a mature organization such as FreshFarm as it looks to \u201creach customers who aren\u2019t coming to farmers markets or get into institutional settings where the quality of food is low,\u201d Yonkers said in an interview with The Post.\n\nBy all accounts, Mogollon is the guy to help grow an organization. In his five years as executive director of Community Foodworks, he developed a number of initiatives to get locally grown produce into the hands of low-income residents, including the Food Hub and \u201csatellite vegetable stands.\u201d This year, Mogollon was one of three executive directors to earn an Excel Award for innovative leadership at nonprofit organizations with annual budgets of $10 million and less.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe saw an opportunity for a niche for Community Foodworks, which was very focused on markets in lower-income areas,\u201d Yonkers said. \u201cThis was an area where farmers markets could play a broad new role. He saw that, and he strategically positioned them to do some really important work in those kinds of markets. It wasn\u2019t haphazard. I think it came from a vision he had.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAdded Mary Rose Conroy, board chair for Community Foodworks, in a statement provided to The Post: \u201cHaving seen Hugo shine throughout the many challenges of growing a small nonprofit, I know he and the staff are more than ready to take our collaboration with FreshFarm to the next level through this merger.\u201d\n\nMogollon is working under a shared services agreement, which means he will serve as executive director for both FreshFarm and Community Foodworks until the legal details of the merger have been finalized. A spokeswoman for FreshFarm said the merger could be complete by the end of the year.\n\nAD\n\nFreshFarm\u2019s new executive director said the merger will create \u201cmore opportunities for farmers and food access. At the same time, we believe farmers markets need to be strengthened in the region. \u2026 There are a lot of opportunities to approach local governments and other stakeholders so we can work together to see what farmers markets need and how we can improve their presence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story stated the merger between FreshFarm and Community Foodworks grew out of interviews with Hugo Mogollon when he applied for the job of executive director. Mogollon suggested the merger when he saw the position was open.\n\nRead more in Food:\n\nAD", "description": "The new organization will keep the FreshFarm name and be led by Ecuador native Hugo Mogollon.", "authors": ["Tim Carman", "Reporter Focusing On National Food Issues", "Critic Covering Affordable", "Under-The-Radar Restaurants In The D.C.
