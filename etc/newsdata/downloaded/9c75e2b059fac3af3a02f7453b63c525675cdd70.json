Of course you are. We all are. Drag queens are everywhere. Drag queens are now totes norms.\n\nIf you need someone to blame for this situation, look no further than Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, the executive producers of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Their production company World of Wonder \u2013 previously responsible for screen triumphs such as The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Party Monster, Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures, and Monica in Black and White \u2013 specialises in prodding about in the nooks and crannies of US pop culture. Drag Race has been attracting a cult crowd since it debuted on American small screens a decade ago. Now Brits must gird their loins: RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK will debut on BBC 3 on October 3.\n\nI interviewed these two Hollywood-based drag-stags at the recent RuPaul\u2019s Dragcon in New York City. (DragCon is the Ideal Home Exhibition of Drag, produced under the aegis of World of Wonder. The first DragCon UK will unfurl, appropriately, at Olympia, in January of next year \u2013 although events such as DragWorld have been happening in Europe since 2017). As hordes of drag queens and drag-chasers poured into the Jacob Javits Center \u2013 yes, that\u2019s the vast hanger where Hilary Clinton found out she had lost the election to Donald Trump \u2013 we enjoyed a cuppa and a kiki (drag-speak for a chat).", "description": "Are you ready for a bloke in a frock named Baga Chipz?", "authors": ["Simon Doonan", "Victoria Coren Mitchell", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2019/09/24/TELEMMGLPICT000206874961-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBvGMFivjC5UfW5rH0avMgaOYBKvF4Gt0aqYxNueHFz4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
