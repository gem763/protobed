And 64% of Americans say they disapprove of Trump\u2019s policies toward climate change, while about half that many say they approve. That 32% approval of his climate policies is the lowest among six issue areas that the poll asked about, including immigration (38%) and health care (37%).\n\nAnn Florence, a 70-year-old retiree and self-described independent from Jonesborough, Tennessee, said she faults Trump on climate change \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening. It is changing if he would just look at what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Meanwhile, 7% of Democrats and 29% of independents approve of Trump on climate change.\n\nRead more: How Climate Change in Iowa is Changing U.S. Politics\n\nRicky Kendrick, a 30-year-old in Grand Junction, Colorado, said he is contemplating leaving the Republican Party, partly over its denial of climate change. \u201cThey don\u2019t see it as a priority at all,\u201d Kendrick, a hardware salesman in the heart of western Colorado\u2019s energy belt, complained of the president and his party. \u201cThere are some (weather) things happening that I\u2019ve never seen before. \u2026 Something\u2019s changing.\u201d\n\nHe was alarmed at Trump\u2019s departure from the Paris climate accord and wants the U.S. to reduce offshore drilling, end subsidies for fossil fuels and ramp up those for renewable energy.\n\nWhile the poll finds about half of Americans want to decrease or eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels, a similar share say subsidies for renewable energy should be increased. But will Trump\u2019s climate change denial \u2014 often voiced in tweets \u2014 matter in 2020?\n\n\u201cClimate has not historically been what people vote on, but I think the tides are changing on that,\u201d said University of Maryland sociologist Dana Fisher, who studies the environmental movement. She said her research shows that young people, who don\u2019t vote in large numbers, are activated by climate change.\n\nClimate change is becoming more of a national priority among Democrats but not Republicans, said Tony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. It might make a difference in a close race, he said.\n\nAccording to the AP VoteCast survey, 7% of voters in the 2018 midterm election called the environment the top issue facing the country. By contrast, 26% said health care was the top issue, 23% said immigration and 18% said the economy and jobs. Democratic voters were far more likely than Republican voters to call the environment the top issue, 12% to 2%.\n\nIn the new poll, roughly three out of four Americans say they believe climate change is happening and a large majority of those think humans are at least partly to blame. In total, 47% of all Americans say they think climate change is happening and is caused mostly or entirely by human activities; 20% think it\u2019s caused about equally by human activities and natural changes in the environment; and 8% think it\u2019s happening but is caused mostly or entirely by natural changes in the environment.\n\nThere\u2019s a large gap between partisans on the issue. Ninety-two percent of Democrats say climate change is happening, and nearly all of those think it\u2019s caused at least equally by human activity and natural changes in the environment. While more than half of Republicans, 56%, say they think climate change is happening, only 41% think human activities are a factor.\n\nAmericans are slightly more likely to favor taxing the use of carbon-based fuels than to oppose it, 37% to 31%. If that revenue is turned into a tax rebate to all Americans, approval ticks up to 43%. About two-thirds of Americans also favor regulating carbon emissions from power and industrial plants.\n\nPeople say they are more likely to oppose than favor expanding offshore drilling (39% vs. 32%), allowing more use of hydraulic fracking to extract oil and natural gas (45% vs. 22%) and building new nuclear power plants (43% vs. 26%).\n\nCompared with five years ago, Americans are somewhat more positive toward policies focused on renewable energy and somewhat more negative toward those that extract oil and gas. In November 2014, 66% of Americans favored funding research into renewable energy sources, while nearly 80% do so today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need coal and oil anymore,\u201d said Brenda Perry, a 77-year-old retired hotel executive and Democrat living in Plymouth, Massachusetts. \u201cWe have other ways of doing energy.\u201d\n\nRodney Dell, 65, likes that Trump has resisted what he sees as panic about the climate. \u201cHis direction is correct,\u201d Dell, a Republican who runs a distribution warehouse, said of the president. \u201cI think the climate policies are overblown a lot.\u201d\n\nStill, Dell, of Irving, Texas, worked in his youth assembling solar panels and is proud that his local library is 100% powered by renewables. He wants more subsidies for green energy and less offshore drilling.\n\n\u201cIf you can do something to conserve energy by using the sun and the wind that\u2019s there every day, it\u2019d be ridiculous not to use them,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,058 adults was conducted Aug. 15-18 using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods and later were interviewed online or by phone.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "That 32% approval of his climate policies is the lowest among six issue areas that the poll asked about, including immigration (38%).", "authors": ["Seth Borenstein", "Nicholas Riccardi", "Hannah Fingerhut"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trump-poll-climate-change.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
