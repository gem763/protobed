We\u2019ve been called firefighters for 30 years & just ask everyone to call us our job title. And that will stop excluding our women firefighters & encourage more to join. https://t.co/GTzdko1KOG \u2014 London Fire Brigade (@LondonFire) September 11, 2019 Report\n\nLondon Fire Brigade has tweeted in support of the move but many others have criticised it.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @Olivia56153973 #firemansam when my daughter was little everytime we saw a fire engine she got so excited that fireman sam was in it. She didnt worry that it wasnt firewoman sandra. This is getting so stupid now. \u2014 Olivia j (@Olivia56153973) September 11, 2019 Report\n\nIt has come under fire in the past for being sexist, with calls for it to be renamed Firefighter Sam.\n\nMr Britzman said he would consider bringing back the character if this was done.\n\n\"The show itself is modern and up to date but the title isn't,\" he said.\n\n\"No-one in the country is called fireman anymore. It's firefighter. That's their rank.\"\n\nThe children's show, set in the fictional Welsh town Pontypandy, has been a mainstay on TV screens since it was created in the 1980s by London firefighter Dave Jones.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Jones said: \"I joined the fire brigade on my 18th birthday [and] if I had said I was a firefighter I would have been slapped down by my colleagues saying 'you are not a superhero, you are just a fireman'.\"\n\n\"We now live in a very PC world,\" he added.", "description": "The children's character is being replaced by male and female fire extinguisher shaped mascots.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EF0A/production/_108749116_mediaitem108749114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
