Not long after that, the news spread that we are divorcing.\u201d\n\nShe admitted that they would sometimes quarrel during their three years marriage but it never got to the extent of a possible split.\n\n\u201cAfter that incident (where he said he had lost his feelings for her), Ahn said he wanted to practise his acting skills and rented a place elsewhere.\n\n\u201cSince then he cut down on his communication with me. Before I knew it, we became separated,\u201d she said, stressing that during their marriage, they seldom had big quarrels.\n\nGoo said the last time she heard from Ahn was when she was admitted into hospital recently.\n\n\u201cHe sent me an SMS to inform me that he will be going back to our house to get his winter clothing.\u201d\n\nGoo said now she too had lost all her feelings for Ahn.\n\n\u201cNow I no longer love him as he had stopped loving me. After all this, I learned to believe in myself and not to believe in love.\u201d\n\nGoo also revealed that she would be making a comeback to the entertainment scene soon and refused to let the divorce with Ahn bring her down.\n\n\u201cThis is just a minor hiccup in my life. I will continue to be strong.\u201d\n\nGoo and Ahn are in the midst of divorce proceedings and the actress\u2019 lawyer had confirmed that she would temporarily leave the entertainment industry and continue with her studies.\n\nRelated Articles S.Korean actress Goo Hye-sun takes to Instagram to plead for termination of agency contract South Korean actress and singer Goo Hye-sun ends two-week \u2018sabbatical\u2019, releases new single South Korean actress Goo Hye-sun claims to have proof Ahn Jae-hyu cheated during marriage", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 \u2014 After months of airing dirty linen about her marriage to Korean actor Ahn Jae-hyun, actress Goo Hye-sun says she has now given up on him and expressed her intention to return...", "authors": ["Sylvia Looi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/14YNM7jMCrvwM7JzU96Ipg--~B/aD03NTE7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/530877192e4b40d9eb2f54b6d74de2ae", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
