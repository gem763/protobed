Putting your bodega-bought apples or clementines in a small bowl on your countertop will brighten even the drabbest of kitchens, and a large decorative bowl filled with a bounty of seasonal produce on your dining table will up the ambiance of your next dinner party without setting you too far back (especially if you can eat the stuff once the party is over). But, as with fresh flowers, the downside of decorating with fruit is that it doesn\u2019t last, whether you eat it or not. So it can be an expensive habit to maintain.\n\nThat\u2019s why, if you like the look, decorative stone fruits \u2014 not peaches or plums or other fruits with \u201cstone\u201d pits, but sculptures of fruit made out of natural materials like alabaster or finer porcelain \u2014 are arguably the best (and most ecofriendly) way to get the fruit-as-d\u00e9cor aesthetic year-round. You can pay a lot for hand-painted, extremely lifelike stone fruits at shops like John Derian, but it turns out you can also scoop up some surprisingly realistic (and more affordable) pieces on Amazon, too. The assortment below features staples like pears, a peach, and a banana \u2014 buy one or two and toss them into your current fruit bowl to make it appear a bit more bountiful, or get a few to start your own fledgling stone-fruit collection. (If you\u2019re ready to go all in, there\u2019s a set of six that just needs a bowl to become instant dining-room d\u00e9cor). And any would make for a delightfully unusual paperweight at the office. It\u2019s worth noting that all of the stone fruits in our list come with free shipping but aren\u2019t available via Prime \u2014 which seems appropriate because sometimes you have to wait a bit longer before you\u2019re able to pick the perfect (and perfectly ripe-looking) pear.\n\nArtificial Red Grapes - 28cm Okay, these are plastic. But if you\u2019re going to go plastic for anything, I\u2019ve found red grapes are the best fruit for it because real ones generally look waxier than their green cousins, which means fake ones made of plastic don\u2019t stand out as much as other plastic fruits \u2014 especially when surrounded by other, more realistic stone fruits. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nItalian Alabaster Fruit - Set of 6 With a red apple, a green apple, and an orange, this set of six features three unique fruits (in addition to a green pear, a lemon, and a peach). Plus, it costs slightly less than buying six individual fruits. $120 at Amazon Buy $120 at Amazon Buy\n\nSome bowls for your stone fruit\n\nCrow Canyon Home Enamelware Serving Bowl - Blue Marble I keep my stone fruits in a blue-and-white marbled bowl like this. It\u2019s definitely a more eclectic choice, but there\u2019s something visually appealing in the way the white and blue contrast with the fruits\u2019 greens, yellows, reds, and oranges. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nLipper International Acacia Wave Serving Bowl You can never go wrong with wood, especially if you\u2019re going for a more classic look. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
