If she had died from the cancer she was being treated for, it would have been easy to answer the question, but she didn't. Her death was suicide -- and that is something I never thought I could or should talk about. I told people it was \"cancer related\" but stayed silent about the reality that it was suicidal depression for 30 years, because even though suicide is a problem in all cultures, religions, races, economic strata, professions and sexual orientations throughout the world, it is universally stigmatized and typically taboo even to discuss.\n\nRuth Golden\n\nI was 19 when she died. She'd been ill for a year and the note she left revealed that she felt she was being a financial and emotional burden on our family -- distracting my sister and I from our college educations, holding my father back in his new job.\n\nNo one in my family ever explicitly told me to keep my mom's suicide quiet, but all discussion of her death, and even her life, seemed to get buried with her at her funeral. I created my own narrative about what happened and turned away from the possibility that her death -- and our silence -- had any impact on my numerous emotional struggles as an adult.\n\nI was wrong, about all of it. By staying silent as I did, the focus remained on how my mom died, robbing me the ability to grieve my actual loss. Nearly three decades later, my dog's cancer diagnosis triggered a massive panic attack and a months-long debilitating depression. Therapy helped me see how the severity of my reaction was directly related to the trauma and grief over my mother's suicide, left unresolved and compounded by our family silence.\n\nSuicide puts specific heavy emotional burdens on those left behind -- with unanswerable questions, what-ifs, guilt and shame. Silence also creates significant emotional barriers with the living because you, in a sense, start living a lie. Not acknowledging my mom became the very large elephant in the room for me at family get-togethers. Conversations, even with my dad and sister, always felt superficial.\n\nRead More", "description": "By staying silent about her mother's suicide, says Ruth Golden, the focus remained on how her mom died, robbing Golden of the ability to grieve the actual loss and keeping her emotionally stuck at the age she was when her mom died.
