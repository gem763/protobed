Smith, a certified public accountant with his own firm in Southfield.\n\n\"It's a whole new tax reporting ball game for them.\"\n\nMany times, newbies to the retirement game get caught short on how much they've withheld for taxes out of their pension checks. And many times, they're not even aware that they're dealing with a new set of retirement-related tax forms.\n\nRetirees need to carefully review how much money they're having withheld from their pension or annuity payments. More\n\n\"No more W-2s. Now it's 1099-Rs for pension and IRA distributions,\" he said. \"And SSA-1099s for Social Security benefits.\"\n\nThis summer, the Internal Revenue Service launched its much-anticipated Tax Withholding Estimator. For those still on the job, the idea is to spend some time plugging in your own numbers to calculate whether you're having enough money withheld from each paycheck to cover your income tax bill.\n\nTax estimator: This tool offers a new way to estimate next year's tax refund\n\nInterest rate cuts: How do you make more money when the Fed cuts rates?\n\nThere's much publicity about getting a \"Paycheck Checkup\" to review your potential income tax bill now. Someone who just bought a home, had a baby or just saw one of their kids turn age 17 is going to want to use the estimator. (Tax breaks are less generous for families who have children age 17 and older.)\n\nBut what about a checkup for those pension checks? It's a smart idea for retirees.\n\nThe IRS has begun making a push to alert retirees that the new estimator can help judge where you're at tax wise if you're retired and getting a pension check or withdrawing money from a 401(k), too.\n\nThe task is essential if you're unsure how your tax deductions changed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nAre you withholding enough?\n\nThe new tax rules included a higher standard deduction \u2014 $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples on the 2018 return \u2014 and that may mean that you're not going to itemize and deduct as much in charitable contributions as in the past.\n\nBut retirees may even have a higher standard deduction than that. An additional standard deduction can apply for those who are 65 or older, or blind.\n\nSingle filers 65 and older can claim an additional $1,600, and married filers who are both 65 and older can claim an extra $2,600. Another $1,300 is available if an elderly taxpayer is blind.\n\nA married couple filing jointly, for example, might have a standard deduction as high as $26,600 if both meet the age requirements or both are legally blind. So you need to take into account some specifics in your own situation.\n\nThe IRS notes that people most at risk for having too little tax withheld include those who itemized in the past but now take the increased standard deduction. \"They also include households with two wage earners, employees with non-wage sources of income and those with complex tax situations,\" the IRS said.\n\nAnd yes, some retirees.\n\n\"Retirees are one of many groups of taxpayers that may be left owing (money) at year's end if they do not have enough taxes withheld and fail to make the estimated tax payments during the year,\" said Andy Phillips, director of The Tax Institute at H&R Block.\n\nA retiree, for example, can use the tool to enter any pension income or Social Security benefits that a couple might be receiving. The estimator goes over your finances, line by line, to give you a more accurate picture.\n\nThe IRS online estimator is broken into six sections \u2014 information about your household, income, adjustments to your income, deductions from income, tax credits and your results.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The risk of having too little set aside for income taxes applies to both workers \u2014 and retirees.
