You too can recount by giving the name and details of a sexual harassment you have known in your job.\"\n\nJust a few hours later, she followed up with: \"You have big breasts. You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night\" along with Mr Brion's name and position.\n\nBut Mr Brion said he had never worked with Ms Muller in any capacity; that he had apologised for his words, and not pursued it after he was rejected.\n\nThe resulting social media campaign behind the hashtag, however, spread Mr Brion's name far and wide, and in December that year, he wrote a response in French newspaper Le Monde.\n\nHe said he made his \"inappropriate remarks\" at a cocktail party late in the evening, \"but only once\" - and said he was not trying to excuse his actions. He also said there was a need for \"truth and nuance\" amid the wave of accusations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Marion and Sarah have both been harassed in the street\n\nHe added that Ms Muller had implied the two had some sort of working relationship in which harassment took place.\n\nHe suggested she had been deliberately vague, in a \"conflation of heavy-handed flirting and sexual harassment in the workplace\".\n\nAs a result, he said it had become extremely difficult to find work.\n\nMr Szpiner, Ms Muller's lawyer, told the court in May: \"If you do not feel that when a man stands in front of you and makes you such a proposal, it's offensive, I'm sorry for you, but today a majority of women and men think it is.\"\n\n\"If this hashtag has been successful it's because thousands of women have recognized themselves [in it],\" he added, in remarks reported by France's 20 Minutes programme.", "description": "Sandra Muller is ordered to pay \u20ac20,000 to the man she accused of flirting with her inappropriately.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/77F2/production/_108960703_gettyimages-862115372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
