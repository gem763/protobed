(Nick Wass/AP)\n\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is dispelling the notion that he is a running back masquerading as a quarterback. Entering Sunday\u2019s showdown at the Kansas City Chiefs, he has completed 41 of 57 passes for 596 yards and seven touchdowns, the most through two games in franchise history, and has added 19 carries for 126 yards.\n\nIn last week\u2019s win over the Arizona Cardinals, Jackson produced the most rushing yards (120) ever for a player who also threw for 250 or more yards in the same game, joining Michael Vick, Cam Newton, Russell Wilson, Marcus Mariota and Colin Kaepernick as the only quarterbacks to produce at least 250 passing yards and 100 rushing yards in a regular season game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a real conundrum for them,\u201d Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said of opposing defenses. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to figure it out for themselves.\"\n\nJackson\u2019s performance will also be a conundrum for sports bettors, with his performance thus far putting him in the MVP conversation, at least according to the odds. Backers of his MVP campaign, though, should be wary: Even after his strong start, there are reasons to be skeptical of Jackson\u2019s chances to win the award.\n\n[Lamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you]\n\nJackson\u2019s odds to be the MVP have improved from 100-1 entering the season to 40-1 after Week 1 to 5-1 as of Wednesday, according to Nick Bogdanovich, director of trading at William Hill U.S. That makes him the second choice, behind reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes (3-1) and ahead of three-time MVP Tom Brady, the third choice at 8-1.\n\n\u201cThings move fast,\u201d Bogdanovich told The Washington Post. \u201cUsually you don\u2019t see people come from the pack that fast. Granted, [Jackson] has faced two of the weaker teams, but he was phenomenal in college, and he has a chance to be really special at this level, too.\u201d\n\nIn general, betting on a quarterback to win the MVP award is a decent gamble. The position has accounted for 11 of the past 12 MVP awards, and the eight rushers who have crashed the party over the past 30 years have been historically good or record-setting. MVP-winning quarterbacks also have a common thread: They typically are on teams that finish first in their division and, over the past 10 years, have been on teams that finish first or second in their conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination. You have to have a big year, and you have to have a winning team,\u201d Bogdanovich said.\n\nIt\u2019s that latter factor, and Baltimore\u2019s standing among AFC competitors, that could derail Jackson\u2019s MVP bid, especially because the quarterbacks on the teams favored to win the AFC are having solid seasons so far, too. Based on each team\u2019s true talent level \u2014 derived by looking at actual win rate, projected win rate based on points scored and allowed, and a regressed win rate that accounts for the small sample size of two games \u2014 the New England Patriots are favored to win the AFC (39 percent), followed by the Chiefs (24 percent) and then the Ravens (12 percent). That puts Brady and Mahomes in a much better position to win the MVP award.\n\nMahomes is the player to beat. The reigning MVP and offensive player of the year has completed 55 of 77 passes (71.4 percent) for 821 yards and seven touchdowns. He leads the league in yards and TD passes without throwing an interception.\n\n[Best bets for NFL Week 3: Bears, 49ers and Chiefs roll on]\n\n\u201cIf Mahomes stays healthy, he will be [the favorite],\" Bogdanovich said. \u201cHe was in uncharted waters last year, and he\u2019s off to a good start again this year. And his team is 2-0.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s odds could improve again if he and the Ravens defeat Mahomes and the Chiefs. The Chiefs are 5\u00bd-point favorites, but it appears winning is the only thing on Jackson\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cI hate losing,\u201d he told ESPN. \u201cYou can have all the stats in the world, but if you\u2019re losing, you\u2019re probably not going to get talked about. Probably will, but not in a good way. It\u2019s all about winning. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nMore on the NFL from The Post:\n\nTroy Aikman says NFL officiating issues are \u2018maddening\u2019 and \u2018nauseating\u2019\n\nTitans-Jaguars was an unwatchable slop-fest.
