This is a mistake.\n\nOver the past decade, air-independent propulsion (AIP) for submarines has spread rapidly around the world. The technology, which allows conventionally powered submarines to operate without access to outside air, has the potential the shift the balance away from the big nuclear attack submarines (SSNs) that have dominated undersea warfare since the 1950s, and back towards small conventional boats. In global terms, this might again make submarines the great strategic equalizer; small, cheap weapons that can destroy the expensive warships of the world\u2019s most powerful navies. Does this mean that the United States should invest in these kinds of boats? Probably not.\n\nInvention\n\nSeveral navies experimented with AIP during the twentieth century. The earliest work began in World War II in the German and Soviet navies, although none of the experiments produced operationally suitable boats. After the war Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union took advantage of German research to produce their own experimental boats, but nuclear propulsion seemed to offer a more fruitful direction for submarine development.\n\nRecommended: 5 Places World War III Could Start in 2018\n\nRecommended: How North Korea Could Start a War\n\nRecommended: This Is What Happens if America Nuked North Korea \u200b\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "They are cheaper and just as deadly.", "authors": ["Robert Farley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3HG6gX6r7QBN7ShA.uP6JQ--~B/aD05NTg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/9ff60fd5d76c9a4d9188e6a8f15f8802", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
