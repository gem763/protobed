SoftBank shares have fallen 20% since late July, pressured by troubling issues in the SoftBank Vision Fund, the company\u2019s $103 billion venture portfolio. There are real problems here, but the selloff has mostly served to make a cheap stock cheaper.\n\nAs I detailed in a recent Barron\u2019s cover story, SoftBank (ticker: SFTBY) is basically a holding company with three kinds of assets: There are companies in which it holds large equity positions, there are assets it owns outright, and there\u2019s the Vision Fund and its still-gestating sibling, Vision Fund II.\n\nAt the time of our story, SoftBank stock was trading at a discount of about 49% to its sum-of-the-parts value. Pressured by multiple factors, but primarily the delayed initial public offering of WeWork parent We Co.\u2014a Vision Fund holding\u2014the discount has increased by about 10 percentage points. At Friday\u2019s close, SoftBank was worth about $90 billion, down from roughly $100 billion in July.\n\nLet\u2019s rerun the numbers. The SoftBank stock story starts with Alibaba Group Holding (BABA). SoftBank owns a 25.8% stake in the China e-commerce giant that\u2019s worth $121 billion. There is no reason to think that SoftBank wants to sell, but if it did, it would probably pay Japanese capital-gains taxes, so discount that total by 30%, which brings us to $84 billion.\n\nSoftBank also owns the chip design licensing firm ARM; 75% of the company is held by SoftBank Group\u2014a stake worth $24 billion based on the original acquisition price\u2014with the rest in the Vision Fund. And it owns two thirds of SoftBank Corp. (9434.Japan), a Tokyo-listed wireless carrier worth about $45 billion. Then there\u2019s a $23.3 billion stake in Sprint (S). SoftBank\u2019s own stake in the Vision Fund is now $32.4 billion. The company also lists 900 billion yen\u2014$8.3 billion\u2014in other equity holdings. Adjust for $46.3 billion in net debt and you get a total value of $171 billion.\n\nThat puts SoftBank\u2019s value 46% below its sum-of-the-parts total. (The discount is even larger if you don\u2019t adjust the portfolio for Alibaba taxes\u2014in that case, SoftBank\u2019s assets come to $208 billion.) If there is another publicly traded asset discounted this deeply, I can\u2019t find it.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s primary problems are in the Vision Fund. Slack Technologies (WORK), which closed at $38 on its first day of trading in June, is since down 20%. Uber Technologies (UBER), under pressure from a range of issues including California\u2019s push to reclassify contract workers as employees, is likewise off 20%. And then there\u2019s We Co., which has nearly $11 billion in capital from SoftBank, about $4 billion of that from the Vision Fund. The company has delayed its IPO in the face of reports that it might be worth $20 billion or less, well under its peak private market value of $47 billion. All of that has stirred up trouble.\n\nThere are reports that some investors in Vision Fund I might scale back participation in Vision Fund II. And SoftBank is taking hits for not reining in the self-dealing, self-aggrandizing WeWork founder Adam Neumann.\n\nThe overarching fear is that Masayoshi Son, universally known as Masa, has lost his touch\u2014that the first fund will struggle to succeed, and that the new fund won\u2019t get off the ground. As I reported, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said this past week at a small event in San Francisco that he sees Uber and WeWork as \u201calmost worthless.\u201d\n\nStill, the math works powerfully against the SoftBank bear case. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane notes that SoftBank\u2019s average cost in We Co. shares is at a $24 billion valuation. Were the company to go public with a $10 billion valuation, SoftBank would take a paper loss of about 60% on its stake; the hit to the Vision Fund would be about $2.5 billion, or just about 2% of its net asset value. Lane does say there are lessons for SoftBank here. \u201cThe We Co. seemed to break new ground in how founders can profit at everyone else\u2019s expense\u2014SoftBank needs to get tough on governance as a condition of their investment,\u201d he wrote in a recent research note.\n\nIn an interview, Lane says that some investors expect the Vision Fund to report weak returns for the September quarter. But, he adds, most Vision Fund investors didn\u2019t invest in a giant venture fund in search of quarterly returns; the fund\u2019s success will be measured over the course of five years or more. While Lane says there could be more pressure on SoftBank in the short term, the stock remains a long-term buy. \u201cI fundamentally believe in what Masa is trying to do.\u201d\n\nOne institutional investor that owns SoftBank stock points out that the market is assigning a negative value to the Vision Fund. And we\u2019re not talking slightly negative. Based on the sum-of-the-parts math, the Vision Fund is being valued at negative $52 billion.\n\nOn Thursday, SoftBank executives quietly held a meeting in Pasadena, Calif., with Vision Fund portfolio companies and institutional investors in SoftBank Group.\n\nOne attendee told me that he was impressed by the collaboration among companies in the fund\u2014he also was wowed by the growth reported by some Vision Fund companies. SoftBank confirmed to me that the event happened, but it was closed to the media, and the company declined to discuss it in detail. (As a Japanese company, Regulation Fair Disclosure, or Reg FD, does not apply.)\n\nAnd yet, this would seem like an opportune moment for Masa to address some of the issues that the Vision Fund faces. Even if he doesn\u2019t, my conclusion is the same: If you buy SoftBank shares, you pay less than nothing to own the world\u2019s largest venture fund. Over the long run, that\u2019s a bet that\u2019s hard to beat.\n\nWrite to Eric J.
