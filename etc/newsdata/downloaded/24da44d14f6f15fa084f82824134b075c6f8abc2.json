HSBC was already rumoured to be planning up to 10,000 job cuts.\n\nQuinn said: 'There is scope throughout the bank to clarify and simplify roles, and to reduce duplication.'\n\nBut he declined to give any more information on how many roles would be cut, and where, until the bank reveals its full-year results in February.\n\nHSBC's chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson said: 'We have been deliberately vague at this point, because we have started a piece of work. But it's not sufficiently advanced to announce anything yet.'\n\nProfits at HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, slid 18 per cent to \u00a33.7 billion in the three months to September compared to the same time last year. Despite the pro-democracy protests still raging in Hong Kong, profits in HSBC's Asia business, where it makes most of its money, actually climbed 4 per cent to \u00a33.6 billion.\n\nQuinn praised staff in the division, despite the criticism which HSBC received earlier this year after it denounced the anti-Beijing protests in full-page adverts taken out in Hong Kong newspapers.\n\nBut Quinn said yesterday: 'We are committed to supporting both Hong Kong and the UK through the challenges they both face.'\n\nMost of the restructuring at HSBC appears to be focused on its US and continental Europe arms. The performance in these parts of the business was 'still well below acceptable levels', Quinn said.\n\nEric Moore, a fund manager at Miton, said: 'This is pretty harrowing given the years of restructuring that shareholders have already had to endure.'\n\nShares slid 3.7per cent, or 23p, to 594.4p,", "description": "Noel Quinn, who is attempting to make his mark as he auditions for the top job, admitted third-quarter results from large swathes of the bank were 'not acceptable'.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
