Here\u2019s how Bob Iger says it could have happened", "language": "en", "text": "Apple Inc. and the Walt Disney Co. could have merged had Steve Jobs not died, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger believes.\n\nVanity Fair on Wednesday published an excerpt from Iger\u2019s upcoming autobiography, in which he detailed his close relationship with Jobs, who died of cancer in 2011. It was that bond that helped pave the way to Disney\u2019s $7.4 billion purchase of Jobs\u2019s other company, Pixar Animation, in 2006.\n\n\u201cI believe that if Steve were still alive, we would have combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously.\u201d\n\nThat deal \u2014 which had many doubters \u2014 saved both companies, Iger wrote, by giving Pixar vastly more resources and re-energizing a then-foundering Disney animation unit.\n\nIger wrote that Jobs appreciated boldness, and gave him a sneak peek at Apple\u2019s new video iPod before it had been announced after Iger one day mentioned to Jobs the idea of \u201can iTunes platform for TV shows\u201d \u2014 the exact thing Jobs had been secretly working on. That led to Disney\u2019s ABC signing on to provide content for the fledgling Apple iTunes video streaming service.\n\nIger also said Jobs vouched for him to the CEO of Marvel Studios during a key point in acquisition negotiations in 2009 that helped smooth that deal, which, like Pixar, has proved lucrative for Disney.\n\nWhile Jobs was Disney\u2019s largest shareholder, Iger said Jobs told him: \u201cYou can\u2019t think of me as that. That\u2019s insulting. I\u2019m just a good friend.\u201d\n\nIger said that about an hour before the announcement of the Disney-Pixar deal, Jobs took him aside and revealed his cancer diagnosis. \u201cI think I owe you the right, given this knowledge, to back out of the deal,\u201d Jobs told him. Iger said he quickly rejected the offer to back out.\n\n\u201cI had no idea if I was doing the right thing, but I\u2019d quickly calculated that Steve was not material to the deal itself, although he certainly was material to me.\u201d Iger said that night he told his wife, who had known Jobs for years, and \u201cinstead of toasting what had been a momentous day in my early tenure as CEO, we cried together over the news.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith every success the company has had since Steve\u2019s death, there\u2019s always a moment in the midst of my excitement when I think, I wish Steve could be here for this,\u201d Iger wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to have the conversation with him in my head that I wish I could be having in real life. More than that, I believe that if Steve were still alive, we would have combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously.\u201d\n\nRumors of a merger between Apple and Disney have been floated over the years, most recently in 2017, when analysts speculated Apple could make a $200 billion-plus megadeal to create a tech and entertainment giant as it repatriated its hoard of overseas cash.\n\nThat never happened, of course, and any deal now would likely be the largest acquisition ever. As of the close of trading Wednesday, Apple AAPL, +0.94% has a market cap of just under $1 trillion, while Disney DIS, +0.36% is valued at about $245 billion.\n\nLast week, Iger resigned from Apple\u2019s board of directors, which he had served on since 2012, now that Apple and Disney are about to launch competing streaming services.", "description": "Apple Inc. and the Walt Disney Co. could have merged had Steve Jobs not died, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger believes.", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR593_igerjo_ZG_20190918194514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
