The second game of the day comes in Oita, where Canada face the unenviable task of trying to keep the All Blacks at bay. This could be a try-fest, and you can follow all the action here: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 New Zealand vs Canada live! Camille Lopez is the official man of the match, which seems both right and wrong. He produced a couple of lovely touches to set up tries, but much of his side's play was poor, inaccurate and lacking in definite structure, and Lopez can be blamed to some degree for that general misfiring.\n\nStill, three kicks of real quality to set up three scores. Advertisement Slippery ball, churning-up pitch, messy rucks, plenty of penalties - this was a pretty poor contest. Neither France nor the USA found any sort of fluidity, and the game suffered. Credit to the USA for showing real fight, but this isn't a fixture to live long in the memory. That scoreline makes the win look comfortable for France, but that's not the truth - this was an incredibly even game. Had the USA put more together offensively, it was theirs for the taking on an error-ridden evening in Fukuoka. But France march onwards with a bonus point victory. FULL TIME FULL TIME: France 33-9 USA TRY! TRY! A powerful maul and Jefferson Poirot crosses! He's figured it out, Poirot, latching on to the drive at the back, getting his hands on the ball and scoring what I believe is his first international try. Camille Lopez pops over the conversion, and that'll do us. France 33-9 USA Advertisement 78 minutes The USA concede a penalty and France go to the corner in pursuit of a fifth try to seal it. Seven metres out they will set a lineout. 76 minutes For all their solidity defensively, it just hasn't happened for the USA in attack. Another wide ball slips through sweaty palms as they try to work space down the right touchline. 75 minutes My oh my that's a mighty tackle! Bernard Le Roux has absolutely crunched a crabbing AJ MacGinty looking to find a gap, decleating the American ten and taking him off his feet. Heavy contact! France have really had to battle but they appear to have secured victory in Fukuoka Advertisement 73 minutes Desperation time for the USA, who have battled so admirably but now look set to come away from the game empty handed. That's nice! Sleight of hand at the line from MacGinty and giving the French defence the eyes as he gives a short ball for replacement lock Greg Peterson, who thumps his big frame down to the France 22. But there's a knock-on on the floor! A shame. There was space for the USA to find on the right if the ball emerged from the ruck, but Peterson just lost control of it as he hit the deck. TRY! TRY! Devastating attack from France and that's the bonus point score! Again it comes from a kick, with a crossfield punt collected well by Alivereti Raka, who is clotheslined by Martin Iosefo but bounces back to his feet, recognising the opportunity. His inwards diagonal charge draws the defender and allows Yacouba Camara to sashay through an opening, and his offload finds the lively Baptiste Serin who gleefully scampers over. France 26-9 USA 69 minutes It'll certainly be enough if the USA do that! They mess up a lineout in solid attacking position, and AJ MacGinty jinks and jumps and then slips a lovely little pass to France's Baptiste Serin! An odd decision from the Sale playmaker. TRY! TRY! Gael Fickou shuffles over! A big sigh of relief from France, who have some breathing room. Fickou eschews a huge overlap outside him to pick a hole between Nick Civetta and replacement prop Paul Mullen and dive over. Camille Lopez adds the extra two. Ten points should be enough, even with 12 minutes still left. France 19-9 USA Advertisement 66 minutes 35 metres from the USA line and Serin has another go around the fringe, creating space on the right with the USA defence sucked in, and Sofiane Guitoune slides down the touchline to within 15 of the line. Big carry from Sebastien Vahaamahina, and Bernard Le Roux follows his locking partner with a meaty meeting. Wide the ball is shifted... 65 minutes Plenty of changes for both sides, with Baptiste Serin now commanding the attack at nine for France. His dart is well stopped, but France just start to play with a little bit of flow. PENALTY! PENALTY! Over it goes! Three points in it. AJ MacGinty strikes his shot at goal cleanly and bisects the timbers. France are in real bother. France 12-9 USA Points it is. They'll keep eating away at this lead...
