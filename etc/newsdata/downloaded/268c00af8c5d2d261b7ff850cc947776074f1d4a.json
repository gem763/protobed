It was joined by four European cities \u2014 London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Moscow \u2014 which are renowned as cycle cities with expansive public rail networks. Nairobi and Sao Paulo rounded out the list.\n\nNo U.S. city made it to the top ranks. A separate 2017 study found that the average American spends a total of 52 minutes per day commuting, with the vast majority \u2014 about 85% \u2014 using a private car or car pool. Just over 5% used public transport, while 2.8% walked or 0.6% cycled.", "description": "Three of Asia's biggest business hubs have emerged as the world's most environmentally-friendly commuter cities in a new study by data insights company Kantar.", "authors": ["Karen Gilchrist"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106185969-1571274414646gettyimages-1072931164.jpeg?v=1571274457", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
