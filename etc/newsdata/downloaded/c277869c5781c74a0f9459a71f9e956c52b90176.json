That was water off a duck\u2019s back to the coach, who repeatedly described himself as a \u201cbeliever\u201d that his players can defy the underdog tag.\n\n\u201cCall me a sucker. I believe in my lads,\u201d Cheika said at the team\u2019s training base in Odawara on Monday. \u201cI know there\u2019s other people who won\u2019t give us much of a chance but I believe that when you believe in yourself you are much closer to being able to create history.\u201d\n\nHe said it was pointless to reflect on why the Wallabies had struggled so badly against England of late. They have won just two of the last 12 Tests, one of which was the drubbing of the tournament hosts at Twickenham in the 2015 World Cup pool stage. England\u2019s average winning margin in the six Tests since has been 15 points.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s irrelevant, really. There is reasons, I\u2019m not trying to avoid it, but why go back and talk about all those games?\u201d Cheika said. \u201cI talked about those games in those press conferences after those games. Looking backwards is only going to give you a sore neck.\u201d\n\nCheika\u2019s enthusiasm waned when quizzed on Jones. The former Randwick club teammates have enjoyed some verbal sparring over the years but the Wallabies mentor did not seem interested in sparking another round.\n\nTheir relationship was \u201cfine\u201d, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see him very much. Yeah fine, it\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nAustralia playmakers offer selection posers for likely England quarter-final | Bret Harris Read more\n\nThis week will potentially be the last at the helm for the five-year coach, who has said he will only apply to stay on if the Wallabies hoist the Webb Ellis Cup. A smiling Cheika told an English reporter he wouldn\u2019t offer a crumb of detail about his future plans.\n\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t know me very well but I\u2019m only thinking about today. I\u2019m genuine. Actually you\u2019d get on pretty well with my missus, she\u2019s always asking what\u2019s going on tomorrow or next week or the week after. I never tell her because I want to enjoy today.\u201d\n\nIn a rugby update, Cheika provided positive news on captain Michael Hooper and lock Adam Coleman, who were both late scratchings from Friday\u2019s win over Georgia. Both had shaken off minor niggles, leaving the only question mark hanging over fullback Kurtley Beale, who is undergoing concussion protocols.", "description": "Michael Cheika has faith in his team to beat England in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals but won\u2019 t bite on questions about Eddie Jones or his own future", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c942ecec2e5e4104930f7ce91e685600616ca212/0_155_4638_2783/master/4638.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64eff37b2ee9b4a981e9212b8f66586c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
