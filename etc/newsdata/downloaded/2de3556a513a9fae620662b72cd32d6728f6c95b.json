She loved being pregnant and longed to help those who couldn\u2019t conceive children.\n\nAD\n\nAssisted reproduction and surrogacy have been around for years, but these days gay men who can afford the cost are choosing this route to parenthood, experts say.\n\nSometimes, however, desire and hope \u2014 and in Wiedenfeld and Johnson\u2019s case, advanced reproductive science \u2014 are not enough to guarantee a baby. A first effort resulted in a miscarriage just a month after the embryo transfer. The second effort had the same outcome, and an even heavier emotional toll for all involved.\n\nBut the two men and Fenn had contractually agreed on three embryo transfers, leaving them one final chance. On a crisp day last spring, nearly nine months later, that chance came due.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAre you ready to be a dad?\u201d Fenn\u2019s eager voice said at the other end of the line.\n\nWeidenfeld and Johnson raced from New York City to the hospital in Connecticut just in time for the birth of a seven-pound, 19.5-inch boy, soon to be known as Teddy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAfter passing the baby around among Fenn, her husband and the two new dads, Weidenfeld turned to Fenn and said, \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done for us. This is not the end of our story together. This is just the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be there for every birthday party and special occasion,\u201d Fenn vowed, smiling. \u201cI hope to always be in their lives,\u201d she said of the family.\n\nAD\n\nThe number of children born through surrogacy is unknown, but surrogacy agencies say the demand for surrogates has noticeably risen in recent years. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 738 babies were born via surrogacy in 2004; in 2014, that the number was 2,807.\n\nVictoria Ferrara, founder and legal director at Worldwide Surrogacy, says about 50 percent of the 80 to 100 surrogacy arrangements her organization facilitates involve gay parents. She estimates the number of babies born through surrogacy every year ranges from 2,500 to 5,000 worldwide.\n\nAD\n\nThe surrogacy process is particularly challenging for gay couples, Ferrara says. \u201cThey have a very strong desire to become parents, but less knowledge of the infertility process and potential for road bumps.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn top of that, many states \u2014 including New York, where Weidenfeld and Johnson live \u2014 do not allow surrogacy arrangements in which any payment is involved. Those payments can run as high as $200,000 to cover the surrogate\u2019s medical expenses and loss of work wages, egg donor costs, IVF clinic fees, and legal and surrogacy agency fees. This is why the men ventured to Connecticut, where compensated surrogacy is legal and where Fenn and her family live \u2014 and where the IVF clinic was located.\n\nBut Weidenfeld and Johnson say it was all worth it. With Teddy\u2019s head rested on his lap, Wiedenfeld smiled down at his tiny son and said to his husband, \u201cThis is who we have been waiting for. This baby was meant to be ours.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Assisted reproduction and surrogacy have been around for years.
