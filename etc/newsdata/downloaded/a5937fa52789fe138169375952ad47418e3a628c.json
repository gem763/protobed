She spoke about the \u201cfour power dynamics of gender, race, seniority and wealth\u201d that she said tilted in Weinstein\u2019s favor \u2015 an imbalance that had made pushing back and speaking up a towering challenge.\n\nChiu was then a young woman of color who was saddled with student debt and clinging to the lowest rung of the Hollywood ladder. Weinstein was a multimillionaire and one of the industry\u2019s most influential figures.\n\n\u201cHarvey was a power player, and I was the lowest person on the totem pole,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cAssistants are the unseen work force that props Hollywood up, and yet we have zero leverage. I was invisible and inconsequential.\u201d\n\n\"I\u2019ve had many years to ruminate on how I fell into Harvey\u2019s trap, and the best way to understand it is through the four power dynamics of gender, race, seniority and wealth,\" writes Rowena Chiu https://t.co/4Tixvq26hZ \u2014 New York Times Opinion (@nytopinion) October 5, 2019\n\nChiu said that on the day of the rape attempt, Weinstein told her \u201che liked Chinese girls ... because they were discreet, he said \u2015 because they knew how to keep a secret.\u201d\n\nThen, just \u201cbefore he tried to rape me, [he said] he\u2019d never had a Chinese girl,\u201d she added.\n\nChiu, who said she had been hired by Weinstein a few months earlier in 1998 and had been bullied by him previously, said she spent hours that night \u201cfending off [Weinstein\u2019s] chitchat, flattery, requests for massages and a bath\u201d before she was ultimately \u201cpushed back against the bed\u201d by her then-boss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d worn two pairs of tights for protection, and tried to appease him by taking one of them off and letting him massage me, but it hadn\u2019t worked,\u201d Chiu wrote of the assault. \u201cHe\u2019d taken off the other pair and I was terrified my underwear would be next. Harvey moved in: Please, he told me, just one thrust, and it will all be over.\u201d\n\nChiu said she, terrified, had pleaded with Weinstein to let her go and eventually managed to \u201cwriggle off the bed and leave.\u201d\n\nChiu \u2014 who first went public with her allegations against Weinstein in a September \u201cToday\u201d show interview and in \u201cShe Said,\u201d a recently published book documenting the Me Too movement \u2014 went on to describe how she and a female co-worker later confronted Weinstein about his behavior.\n\nChiu said, however, that they were laughed at by their senior colleagues and were compelled to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\n\n\u201cWhen we began attempts to report Harvey to his superiors or the police, multiple senior individuals acted to shut us down. Some outright laughed in our faces. The message was always the same: Who would ever believe us over the most powerful man in Hollywood?\u201d Chiu said.\n\nShe added that the negotiations for the NDA had been conducted under \u201cconditions of extreme duress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were once kept at the office overnight, from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m., escorted to the bathroom, provided with the barest minimum of food and drink and not permitted pen and paper to keep notes,\u201d Chiu wrote. \u201cWe were not even allowed to keep a copy of this most egregious of agreements: We had signed our lives away in a complex 30-page document that we could not refer to.\u201d\n\nWeinstein denied Chiu\u2019s allegations through a lawyer last month. He claimed he\u2019d had a \u201csix-month physical relationship\u201d with Chiu that was consensual \u2015 a suggestion that Chiu has vehemently denied.\n\nThe attorney added that Weinstein was \u201cnow studying taking legal action\u201d against Chiu for breaking the NDA, AP reported.\n\n\"Harvey [Weinstein] is very persistent. He has a tendency to cajole... he's a very big guy, he pushed me back against the bed and I was petrified and terrified as he tried to rape me,\" Rowena Chiu is a new Harvey Weinstein accuser who is speaking out for the first time. pic.twitter.com/YGn0wG5tR4 \u2014 3rd Hour of TODAY (@3rdHourTODAY) September 9, 2019\n\nChiu said she\u2019d accepted a settlement of about $213,000 from Weinstein.\n\nBut she said her silence came at a far higher price.\n\nIn the years following the alleged assault, Chiu said she attempted suicide twice. She felt overwhelmed by the \u201cdevastating, suffocating secret\u201d she carried \u2015 one she didn\u2019t dare share with even those closest to her.\n\n\u201cI suffered, completely isolated from those around me who could have provided the support I needed: a loved one, a trusted pastor, a respected therapist \u2014 even the man I would marry,\u201d Chiu wrote. \u201cI spent decades grappling with guilt that I took the job, that I hadn\u2019t left the room sooner, that it was somehow my fault, that I hadn\u2019t handled Harvey \u2018robustly\u2019 enough, that I was not tough enough to work in the film industry.\u201d\n\nChiu said she finally decided to come forward with her story after hearing the public testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, then a nominee for the Supreme Court, of sexual assault. Chiu said she was also inspired by other women who\u2019d told their own Me Too stories about Weinstein and others.\n\nWeinstein has been accused by about 70 women of sexual misconduct ranging from sexual harassment to assault and rape. He has denied all allegations.\n\nChiu said she felt it was important that she lend her voice \u2015 \u201can Asian voice, an assistant\u2019s voice, to join the array of voices in the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am happy that my children can know my secret; I am grateful to be able to be honest with family and friends, who are coming forward in droves to offer support,\u201d Chiu concluded her op-ed. \u201cI can briefly glory in the relief that I am no longer sitting on a sickening secret that has \u2014 finally and ultimately \u2014 come to light.\u201d", "description": "In an emotional op-ed, Rowena Chiu described how Weinstein attempted to rape her in 1998 and why she stayed silent until Me Too.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9af7e22100006601ab6b17.jpeg?cache=xikkcoasmf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
