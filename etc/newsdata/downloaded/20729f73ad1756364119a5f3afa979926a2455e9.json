The writer expressly acknowledges the limits of his or her knowledge and also measures contemporaneous accounts from public sources against the private information reportedly conveyed. The full complaint also carefully points out which information was reported in the press, including by the Ukrainian government, which information came from private sources, and what information was potentially classified. The whistleblower is also careful to delineate what information is known and what is still not known\u2014such as why President Trump allegedly directed that nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine be suspended in July.\n\nNotably, the complaint is not based on direct knowledge. Secondhand information is, of course, less reliable than first-hand information\u2014as Trump\u2019s defenders were eager to point out. But intelligence is frequently secondhand. If intelligence reports included information only from those who were literally in the room when the nuclear weapon was made, there wouldn\u2019t be many intelligence reports.\n\nImportantly, the whistleblower makes clear up front, on page 1 of the complaint, \u201cI was not a direct witness to the events described.\u201d There is no hiding the ball. The whistleblower then says, \u201cI found my colleagues\u2019 accounts of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another. In addition, a variety of information consistent with these private accounts has been reported publicly.\u201d\n\nThe most important word here is multiple\u2014which, according to the writer, means \u201cmore than half a dozen U.S. officials.\u201d And the word appears in relation to each of the most serious claims in the complaint. Multiple officials allegedly told the whistleblower about: the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; the disturbing transfer of the verbatim transcript to a classified system in an alleged effort to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the phone call; contacts between Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, and Ukrainian officials that reportedly circumvented the national security decision-making processes; the communication to Ukrainian leaders that a meeting or phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart depended on Zelenskyy\u2019s willingness to \u201cplay ball\u201d on the issues Giuliani had publicly raised involving investigations that would help Trump in his 2020 reelection bid; and that the instruction to suspend military assistance to Ukraine had come directly from the president.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about relaying rumors by the lone office gossip or low-level bureaucrats on the fringes of the decision-making apparatus. The multiple sources in the complaint are all said to be U.S. officials, many with \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d of the events described, including \u201cWhite House officials.\u201d", "description": "Trump\u2019s defenders have dismissed the complaint against him as hearsay.
