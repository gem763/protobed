And for two days, the neighborhood, known as one of London\u2019s quaintest, explodes with life.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re used to living in a city, especially in London, you can spend a lot of time on the tube, not making eye contact with people. Everyone\u2019s always tired or in a rush to get somewhere, and there\u2019s not much connection. It can feel very sterile and impersonal,\u201d photographer Alice Zoo explains. But Carnival \u2014 an over-50-year-old tradition \u2014 is different. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly pressed up against people, and there\u2019s a lot of smiling and laughing and dancing.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nLast weekend, Zoo, who is known for thoughtful portraiture, shot Carnival in a new way. She set out to find the wallflowers amid one of the biggest, most colorful parties London throws, creating little windows of intimacy in the whirl of feathers and sequins.\n\n\u201cI found myself drawn to characters and individuals instead of just moments,\u201d Zoo explains. So she lingered in the cross streets of the parade, making connections with people who were grabbing a bite or attempting a shortcut, encouraging them to remain as natural as possible.\n\nShooting at Carnival presents some unique challenges. \u201cLots of people go there expecting to be photographed because it\u2019s such an inherently photographic environment. They have an expectation of what kind of picture that\u2019s going to be \u2014 one that\u2019s centering on the costume, rather than the person. When I photograph somebody it\u2019s because I find them compelling or beautiful,\u201d Zoo says. \u201cI hope that my portraits are as compelling as the people that are in them.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo/(C) Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo\n\nPhoto: Alice Zoo", "description": "Photographer Alice Zoo, who is known for thoughtful portraiture, shot London\u2019s Notting Hill Carnival in a new way.
