REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nOracle is competing against Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp to offer cloud services, where businesses use Oracle\u2019s data centers to handle their computing needs. In recent years, cloud providers have worked to woo large businesses that still run their own data centers to move some or all of that work to the cloud.\n\nVMware has emerged as a key player because many cloud holdouts use it to power their own data centers. To win over those customers, cloud providers need technical compatibility with VMware. Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google have all announced partnerships with VMware in recent years.\n\nOracle, which announced the deal at its annual user conference in San Francisco, OpenWorld, has designed a system to allow joint customers to move VMware-based computing work to its cloud without reworking the code, said Clay Magouyrk, senior vice president of engineering Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on giving customers maximal control,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWe had to do some very fundamental engineering.\u201d\n\nThe two companies said that Oracle would offer technical support to customers who run its applications on top of VMware. Many companies will not run business-critical systems like financial software with the option for support.\n\nOracle and VMware have clashed in the past over the issue.\n\nVMware\u2019s core tool splits up one physical computer server into multiple smaller \u201cvirtual\u201d machines to ensure that all of a company\u2019s computers are put to full use. Oracle offered a competing product and was unclear on whether it would provide support when, for example, its financial software was used with VMware.\n\nOracle said on Monday it would now provide support for those situations.\n\n\u201cCustomers don\u2019t want to deploy two products unless it\u2019s supported by both vendors. This was a stumbling block for the past two decades,\u201d said Sanjay Poonen, chief operating officer for customer operations at VMware, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with Oracle is significantly better than it was 20 years ago. It\u2019s a new day.\u201d", "description": "Oracle Corp and VMware Inc on Monday announced a deal designed to resolve years of tension over how Oracle handles technical support for VMware users and make it easier for them to move to Oracle's cloud computing service.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430626464&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1T4", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
