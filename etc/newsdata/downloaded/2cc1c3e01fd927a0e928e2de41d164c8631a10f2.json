YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nWhile making your own wine from scratch requires a lot of resources and know-how, you don't need to be a winemaker to blend your own wine.\n\nYou'll probably even feel more like a scientist, mixing ratios trying to find the key to the elixir of youth - or just a decent wine to drink around a fire.\n\nPICS: Why it's so hard to leave SA's second oldest wine farm\n\nThe tasting room at Middelvlei. (Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nI got to try my hand at my first blending experience at Stellenbosch's Middelvlei Wine Estate - farm animals, an old-school farmhouse and rolling lawns make up this quaint off-the-beaten-track wine farm.\n\nSeparated in groups on a tour with Google, we had one goal - who could make the best wine? With Shiraz, Pinotage and Merlot as our ingredients, my group took our task very seriously. I grew up in this very Stellenbosch region and have been living in Cape Town for half-a-decade, so eyes were on me to help suss out the winning combo.\n\nYou have one small measuring tube to test drive the combinations you can think of before blending the chosen ratio in the bigger bottle-sized measuring tube. You have the option to add sweetener and/or wood flavouring to your wine, but that was instantly scoffed at by our team.\n\nYour wine blending kit - it can get a bit messy. (Photo: Gabi Zietsman\n\nNext to us, another team had other ideas though, as they added something like 20 drops of the sweetener to their wine, especially poignant seeing as the wine expert recommended between two and three drops beforehand.\n\nWe started with a blend dominated by Pinotage and a small base of Merlot, but opted instead for a dominant Shiraz blend for fruitier tones.\n\nWATCH: This is how wine corks and barrels are made\n\nLou from Google pouring our best blend. (Video: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nAfter pouring our final masterpiece into our bottle, giving it the name of Airport Vino (our team leader said it's a good enough wine for grabbing at the airport before a flight) and it went for judgement by the experts of Middelvlei.\n\nMunching nervously on the most scrumptious farm bread, they returned with their verdict - we were a close second! The team with 70% Shiraz stole the hearts of Middelvlei, but in our minds, we were still the real winners.\n\nThe sweetener team just received a laugh when asked for comment on their wine.\n\nWATCH: From fynbos to wine farm - the new way to hike Hermanus\n\nThe delectable potbrood.
