The pound was last up 1.9% at $1.2447 <GBP=>.\n\n\"With a Brexit deal looking more likely and U.S.-China talks showing more progress, it's just clear that the dollar is losing some safe-haven demand,\" said Juan Perez, senior currency trader, at Tempus Inc in Washington.\n\nOn Thursday, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October to allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion, after what he called a very positive meeting with Boris Johnson. Ireland is a major factor in the prolonged Brexit impasse.\n\n\"Once again, as the door for further discussions seemed to be closing, the glimmer of hope shone a little brighter,\" said Tim Riddell, macro strategist, at Westpac in London.\n\n\"Whether there is time to create the foundations for any form of agreement into next week's EU Leader's Summit so that it can be debated at UK Parliament's special sitting on the 19th is still a distant hope,\" he added.\n\nInvestors also voiced hopes that Washington and Beijing could reach a trade agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic: Dollar Drop - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7172/7103/Dollar%20drop.png\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic: Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 - http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday said China was willing to reach an agreement with the United States on matters both sides care about to prevent further escalation in tensions, the state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nLiu, China's top trade negotiator, made his comment in Washington when he met with U.S. officials as trade talks between the two countries started.\n\nIn afternoon trading, the dollar index posted its biggest daily drop in five weeks.
