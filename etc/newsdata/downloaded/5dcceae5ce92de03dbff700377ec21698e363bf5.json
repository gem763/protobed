Some pieces \u201chad already deteriorated significantly or had high levels of moisture and were on their way to deterioration,\u201d Mr. Landau said.\n\nHe explained that retrofitting the bridge with a steel support structure would have cost \u201ca little less than rebuilding\u201d but would have been more expensive in the long run, because there would have been \u201csignificant maintenance needs and costs\u201d after about 15 years.\n\n\u201cWe felt a brand-new bridge could last longer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLook, nobody wants to build a piece of infrastructure and have it open for a short period of time, only to have to close and start again \u2014 that\u2019s not what any of us hoped to do with this project,\u201d Mr. Landau said.\n\nHe also said that what set Brooklyn Bridge Park apart was that it was \u201cnot the standard design in New York City.\u201d\n\nOne of the most ambitious park projects in recent memory, the 85-acre park was built over old piers that had once served a cargo port. The new promenades, playgrounds and soccer fields were planned and are overseen not by New York City\u2019s parks department but by Mr. Landau\u2019s group, a nonprofit entity like the one that operates the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\n\n\u201cDesign risks were taken at every step in building this park,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety-nine percent of those design risks have paid off. This is one of those moments where we took a design risk and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe money for the replacement bridge is being drawn from the park\u2019s capital reserve fund, which comes from the park\u2019s budget. The budget, in turn, comes largely from payments in lieu of property taxes paid by buildings along the park\u2019s perimeter as part of the original plan that the park be self-sustaining.", "description": "Squibb Park Bridge in Brooklyn, designed to bounce underfoot, has been demolished.
