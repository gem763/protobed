Those charges carry a potential death sentence, the Washington Post reports.\n\nProsecution in the U.S. relies on whether British authorities will release evidence to American courts.\n\nThe issue is currently being decided in the Supreme Court of the U.K.\n\nThe third 'Beatle', Mohammed Emwazi, is accused of killing Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Kassig. Emwazi was killed in a drone strike in 2015.\n\nThe fourth member, Aine Davis, was convicted in Turkey and sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nTurkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the start of the offensive - called 'Operation Peace Spring' - on Wednesday afternoon, and soon after, jets and artillery bombarded Kurdish positions along the border - sending thousands of civilians fleeing.\n\nThe intensive shelling paved the way for Turkish troops to start crossing the Syrian border on Wednesday evening.\n\nTrump - who ordered American troops out of the area - said Turkey's incursion into the area was a 'bad idea' and said that Washington 'does not endorse this attack.'\n\nIn the statement, Trump added that Turkey had committed to 'ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place - and we will hold them to this commitment.'\n\nMohammed Emwazi is one of the four ISIS 'Beatles', pictured brandishing a knife in 2014.
