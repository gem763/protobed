Similar to how Louisiana deployed emergency cyber-teams to deal with a rash of ransomware infections at three local school districts, Texas officials did the same.\n\nTexas DIR deployed experts from more than ten government agencies and private sector partners to help cities recover.\n\nSome cities restored impacted systems from backups, while other rebuilt networks from scratch. This allowed municipalities to avoid paying ransom demands.\n\nTaxpayers don't want cities paying ransoms anymore\n\nBy doing so, government officials avoided another PR catastrophe. In recent months, taxpayers have been turning on cities that fail to invest or to safeguard IT networks, and then agree to pay gigantic ransom demands to criminal gangs.\n\nSeveral cities have done so, and they've been heavily criticized, such as Riviera City, Florida, Lake City, Florida, and Jackson County, Georgia.\n\nAn IBM survey published this week echoed this criticism. IBM found that 60% of respondents (US taxpayers) were against cities using state funds to pay ransom demands in ransomware incidents.\n\nInstead, 90% of respondents said they would be in favor of the US government increasing federal funding to improve cities' cybersecurity.\n\nAs a result of more and more cities choosing to pay ransoms, recently, ransomware gangs have also become more brazen in their demands.\n\nAfter realizing that insurance companies are likely to advise governments to pay ransom demands instead of covering the huge costs of rebuilding IT networks from scratch, ransomware gangs have started requesting more money.\n\nAfter crooks demanded $2.5 million from Texas officials, this week, news also broke that another ransomware gang requested a whopping $5.3 million from a Massachusetts town, an offer the city turned down and decided to restore from backups, albeit it was initially willing to pay $400,000.\n\nAdvice from Texas responders\n\nFor this reason, it is important that cities protect their networks, instead of waiting around for something bad to happen, and then react to improve security.\n\nTo help out, the incident responders who managed the ransomware infections at the 22 Texas municipalities have published advice this week that companies and government organizations can follow:", "description": "More than half of impacted cities and towns are now operating as normal.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/20/4143b302-14f1-4875-bf1b-99f95ff43d43/thumbnail/770x578/97b92e814d0ea3be291ad1d2443d04ae/security-lock-keyboard-620x250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
