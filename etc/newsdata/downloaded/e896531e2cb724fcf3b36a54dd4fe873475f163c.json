The language policy also makes provision for mechanisms for academic oversight, effective management and good governance relating to language implementation, within a framework that enables faculties to customise their language implementation plans, and their mechanisms for accountability and reporting to the relevant structures.\"\n\nIt said the purpose of the policy was that every faculty compiles its own language implementation plan.\n\nThe institution said that, in instances where classes were large, an effort would be made to offer separate lectures in Afrikaans and English where possible.\n\nThe policy and plans must ensure that no student who has yet to master Afrikaans or English at an academic level will be excluded from academic tuition.\n\n\"When students from both language groups are studying the same module, both groups will participate in group work, class assignments, tutorials and practical sessions, the aim being to stimulate frank debate and a diversity of ideas and viewpoints.\n\n\"Where Afrikaans and English are used in the same lecture, all information will be conveyed in at least English, with a summary or notes of key points in Afrikaans as well. Questions will at least be answered in the language in which they are asked,\" said Stellenbosch University.", "description": "The Constitutional Court is expected to deliver judgment in a case about Stellenbosch University's decision to adopt a controversial 2016 language policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1882/de6c553cd1224c70b3d68bde7b68dad3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
