He said he\u2019s concerned that police mistrust him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cI have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\ncharleyproject.org Jonelle Matthews of Greeley, Colorado, was 12 when she vanished in 1984.\n\nMatthews was reported missing on Dec. 20, 1984, after returning home from performing a Christmas concert with her classmates. Her body wasn\u2019t found until earlier this year, when construction workers excavating for a pipeline in a rural part of Weld County, Colorado uncovered her remains.\n\nPankey and his former wife lived about 2 miles from her home when Matthews disappeared in 1984. On the night she went missing, Pankey said he was home with his then-wife, their 1980 Toyota Corolla already packed for an early-morning trip the next day to visit family in Big Bear Lake, California.\n\nThey returned home to Colorado on Dec. 26, 1984, Pankey said, and heard the news of a missing child on the radio.\n\n\u201cI never met Jonelle, I never met her family, I didn\u2019t know she existed or disappeared until Wednesday, Dec. 26 (1984),\u201d Pankey said.\n\nFacebook Steve Pankey, 64, ran for governor of Idaho as a Constitution Party candidate in 2014 and again as a Republican in the primary in 2018.\n\nPankey said he\u2019d had previous brushes with the law in Colorado, charged with what he called a \u201cdate rape\u201d in 1977 at the age of 26. He said the sex was consensual and the charge was later dismissed by prosecutors. He also said he\u2019d been charged with several other misdemeanors over the years \u2014 including battery and harassment by phone \u2014 but won after going to trial multiple times.\n\nThe Statesman was unable to verify those claims because Colorado courts do not have an online records system, and requested copies of documents related to the criminal charges had not yet arrived via U.S. Mail on Friday afternoon.\n\nDenver Post via Getty Images Jonelle's mother hangs her Christmas stocking in their home in Greeley, Colorado on December 24, 1984. The child was reported missing on Dec. 20, after returning home from performing a Christmas concert with her classmates.\n\nIn a prepared statement released Friday, the Greeley Police Department said although Pankey had made repeated efforts to talk to detectives throughout the investigation, he refused to talk to detectives when they visited him in Twin Falls, Idaho, on Aug. 15.\n\nPankey also said law enforcement asked him for a DNA sample on Aug. 19, which he provided. The Greeley Police Department, however, says they have never sought DNA from Pankey.\n\nThe Greeley Police Department worked with law enforcement in Twin Falls to search Pankey\u2019s Twin Falls home on Sept. 4.
