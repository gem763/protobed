(Photo: Rachel Luna, FilmMagic)\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nLovato channeled the over-the-top stylings of Marie Antoinette in what she wrote was \"round 1\" of her Halloween costumes. In an Instagram post Friday, the 27-year-old singer showed off an elaborate ruffled dress with a huge blond wig and flawless makeup.\n\n\"I told y\u2019all I don\u2019t play on Halloween!! It\u2019s my time to shine,\" Lovato captioned the photos, thanking her glam team for the wardrobe, hair and makeup assists.\n\nNick Viall\n\nFormer \"Bachelor\" star Viall's costume channeled the franchise's new star. Bachelor Nation fans will recognize Viall as Peter Weber, a Delta Air Lines pilot and the upcoming reality show lead. Viall, 39, wore a pilot's uniform, carried a rose and stuck a bandage onto his forehead, just like the real Weber, who had to get stitches earlier this month after he injured himself while filming \"The Bachelor\" in Costa Rica.\n\n\"Just a Pilot on a flight for love .. will probably crash into a windmill tonight\" Viall captioned the photo.\n\nJessica Biel and Justin Timberlake\n\nBiel channeled her husband's past as a boy band member, dressing like an NSYNC-era Justin Timberlake, crunchy frosted tips and all. Timberlake got in on the fun in a giant microphone costume.\n\n\"This is what happens when you admit on TV that you don\u2019t know any NSYNC songs and you\u2019re married to @justintimberlake,\" Biel captioned an Instagram post Saturday. \"Well played, husband, well played.\"\n\nKate Beckinsale\n\nForget \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" Beckinsale went for a snack at a convenience store. Dressed as an Audrey Hepburn lookalike, complete with a long, black dress, oversize hat and classic pearls, the model/actress, 46, posed in an Instagram photo with pal Jonathan Voluck (dressed in an Elton John-style glittering LA Dodgers costume), shopping in character for Funyuns.\n\nWhat to watch: 5 TV shows and movies to binge for Halloween 2019\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/27/halloween-2019-halsey-evan-peters-turn-heads-sonny-and-cher/2479646001/", "description": "Stars are already busy celebrating Halloween.
