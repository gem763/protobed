These JSE Giants Have Really Fallen off", "language": "en", "text": "What a cold and depressing winter it has been\u2026 For the JSE that is.\n\nSince Steinhoff's debacle, we've seen some of the largest companies on the JSE crash 30% to over 89%, which I'll explain in just a minute.\n\nAnd there are no signs yet for recovery until the end of 2019.\n\nIn today's article we'll cover the Ugly and the Bad for the JSE and a little bit of Good on how we can profit during these solemn times.\n\nLet's get to it\u2026\n\nTHE UGLY\n\nGoing back to our opening line, some of the JSE\u2019s darlings that have taken a major fall include:\n\nBritish American Tobacco -33%\n\nAspen -74%\n\nBrait -78%\n\nEOH over 87% and\n\nTongaat Hulett -89%\n\nThis has been a major lesson for us South Africans as we have now seen that even the most established, profitable, highly valued and diversified companies can still collapse like a penny stock.\n\nThis is due to abysmal returns, lack of leadership, fraud, mismanagement global issues and the ongoing trade-wars. In fact, if we consider how the JSE has performed over the past three years you won\u2019t be surprised to know the annual return has only been 5.6%.\n\nThe sad reality is you would\u2019ve been better off leaving your cash in the bank.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nWith the ever-escalating US-China trade war \u2013 it is making things worse for stocks world-wide. In fact, just recently on 1 September, tariffs of over $110 billion worth of Chinese goods were added and the JSE took yet another tumble, as we saw a number of both mining and retailers down including.\n\nA 3.37% drop on Anglo American Platinum\n\nA 5% fall on Imperial Logistics\n\nA 4.56% drop on Massmart and\n\nA 4% fall on Intu Properties.\n\nAnd we can expect a further fall for the JSE in the final quarter of 2019.\n\nNick Pitro, senior consultant at Austin Morris Associates confirmed\n\n\u201cIf you live in South Africa and have a house and pension here, keep them, but take as much of your investable money out as you can. Staying invested in local assets is likely to erode your wealth over time\u201d.\n\nWhy this box is setting up a 9.13% drop on the ALSI\n\nLooking at the daily chart of the JSE ALSI index, you can see that the price has fallen over 11% in the past three months from 53,000 down to 47,065.\n\nAnd during the last two months, it has been forming and consolidating in a pattern known as a continuation box formation (Grey Shaded area).\n\nThis pattern is more often than not reflects a pause in the current downtrend direction, before the sellers take over again to drive the price lower.\n\nWhen this happens, we can expect the price to break below the box formation, which will take it to the next target of 44,501.\n\nTo calculate this target, we\u2019ll simply use the Top-Bottom formula.\n\nTarget = (Bottom - Top) + Bottom\n\n= (47,065 \u2013 49,629) + 47,065\n\n= 44,501\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nOnce the price breaks below 47,065 and continues to the downside, we can then expect another 9.13% drop to 44,501 which we can profit from.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Timon Rossolimos covering: .
