He has not been punished. \"Different strokes different folks clearly,\" Brown wrote .\n\nAnother target was Brown's longtime Steelers teammate Ben Roethlisberger, who was suspended for four games after he was twice accused of sexual assault.\n\n\"4 games for Big Ben crazy world I'm done with it,\" Brown tweeted over a screenshot of a news article about the investigation.\n\nGrievance over $9M US signing bonus?\n\nBrown was traded out of Pittsburgh and released in Oakland after his off-field antics became too much for those teams. The Patriots signed him anyway, and just days later a woman filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing him of rape. He played in one game, then was released after the team learned he tried to intimidate a second woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nBrown's first tweet on Sunday seemed to be indicate that a fight over his $9 million US signing bonus is headed for a union grievance.\n\nThe first payment of the bonus was due on Monday, and the Patriots have not paid. The team is attempting to void the deal and withhold the money, even after playing him in one game after knowing about two separate accusations of sexual misconduct, one of them including an allegation of rape.\n\nBrown had also been guaranteed $29 million by the Raiders.\n\n\"Will not be playing in the NFL anymore,\" he wrote. \"These owners can cancel deals do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the NFLPA hold them accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2 months will see if they pay up !\"\n\nBrown also appeared to condone threats made against the Sports Illustrated writer whose article included the allegations that led to Brown's release. Over a news article describing the threats from some Patriots fans, Brown wrote, \"System working effectively.\"", "description": "In a Twitter rant Sunday morning when his most recent team was getting ready to play without him, former New England Patriots receiver Antonio Brown said he will \"not be playing in the NFL anymore.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293166.1569164270!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/brown-antonio-190915-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
