Man City have put Liverpool under pressure today by getting a good result.\n\n\"Liverpool have responded and that is the name of the game. They have to keep going. They will be disappointed to have conceded but they have recovered well.\n\n\"You have to keep going. No one is going to hand you the championship. You have to earn the right, week in and week out. Whether you play well or not.\"\n\nThe result means Liverpool have now won nine and drawn one in the Premier League, and Keane believes they could be on course for their first top flight title since 1990.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe added: \"They have grinded the result out today. I think the goals were gifted by Tottenham, poor defending. But over the course of the 90 minutes they were the better team.\n\n\"Do you know what, I probably shouldn't say these words, but they played like champions. They responded really well and were by far the better team.\"\n\nLiverpool are next in action when they take on Arsenal in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.", "description": "The former Manchester United midfielder appeared to concede the Premier League title may be heading to Anfield for the first time at the end of this season", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20156903.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DDP_CHP__1121keaneJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
