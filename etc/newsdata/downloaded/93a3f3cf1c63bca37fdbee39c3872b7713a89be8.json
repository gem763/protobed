I am deeply shocked by the news.\"\n\nHow was he caught?\n\nThe case dates back to 2018, when the RCMP was assisting the FBI on a separate investigation, during which investigators came across documents that suggested there might be some internal corruption - \"a mole\".\n\nThat sparked a separate investigation to discover the source of the leak and to the arrest of Mr Ortis.\n\nAs soon as it learned there was cause for concern, the force took immediate steps to safeguard intelligence, the RCMP said.\n\nFew details of the joint inquiry have been made public but media reports have linked it into an investigation into the Vancouver-based company Phantom Secure, whose CEO has pleaded guilty to facilitating international narcotics traffic by supplying drug cartels with encrypted communications devices.\n\nIt also remains unclear what the sensitive information he accessed was - The RCMP has a wide range of national security-related responsibilities, including investigations into terrorist and criminal activity.\n\nA high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, US financier Bill Browder, told Reuters Mr Ortis was looking into allegations that Russian tax fraudsters had laundered millions of dollars through Canada.\n\nWhat has he been charged with?\n\nMr Ortis is accused of breaching the Security of Information Act and the Criminal Code.\n\nThe five charges filed against him include the \"unauthorised communication of special operational information\", possessing a device or software \"useful for concealing the content of information or for surreptitiously communicating, obtaining or retaining information\", and breach of trust by a public officer.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cameron Ortis was a civilian employee with the RCMP\n\nThe offence took place between 2015 and 2019 during his tenure as an RCMP employee.\n\nNone of the allegations against Mr Ortis have been tested in court. If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in jail.\n\n\"We recognise that these allegations, if proven true, are extremely unsettling,\" said RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki said.\n\nHow damaging could this be?\n\nCanada is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that also includes the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether information, such as operational intelligence, sources and investigative methods, was compromised.\n\nMs Lucki says for the moment allies continue to share intelligence but conceded there is \"always the possibility\" they might lose trust.\n\nMr Wark told the BBC that the damage could be \"very serious\" but that \"no one knows what the link between potential and real damage might be at this stage\".\n\nIt appears that his work dealt with elements of both cyber security and organised crime, said Mr Wark, but he noted that being employed in \"a kind of intelligence hub\" for the RCMP means he could have had access to databases and information beyond his immediate role.\n\n\"The reality of his position is he would have had knowledge of a wide range of national security files,\" he said. \"That's partly what of course worries Canada and worries Canada's allies.\"", "description": "A senior intelligence employee under arrest is said to have had access to allies' information.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D83A/production/_108845355_hi056482448.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
