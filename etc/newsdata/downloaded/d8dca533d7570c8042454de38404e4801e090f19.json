The Athletic reported the Angels are \u201cstill evaluating all aspects\u201d of the team, which went 72-90 this season.\n\nThe Athletic reported earlier this week that the team would be interested in moving on from Ausmus if it could hire Joe Maddon. On Sunday, Maddon announced with the Chicago Cubs that the sides are mutually parting ways as his contract expires.\n\n\u201cI have a contract,\u201d Ausmus told reporters after Sunday\u2019s 8-5 home loss to the Astros in the regular-season finale. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I know.\u201d\n\nAusmus, 50, was hired by Los Angeles last October after being an assistant to general manager Billy Eppler in 2018. He had previously managed the Detroit Tigers from 2014-17, going 314-332.\n\nAusmus was hired to replace Mike Scioscia, who spent 19 years leading the Angels, including to a World Series title in 2002.\n\nMaddon was with the Angels\u2019 organization in various capacities \u2014 including as a player, scout, coach and interim manager \u2014 from 1975 to 2005. As interim manager, he went 27-24 across two separate stints in 1996 and 1999.\n\nMaddon has since spent nine years leading Tampa Bay and five leading Chicago, including winning a World Series title with the Cubs in 2016.
