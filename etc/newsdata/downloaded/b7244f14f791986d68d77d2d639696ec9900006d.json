Many of them are leaking into the ground.\n\nAccording to NBC, some nuclear experts have said Hanford is \"an underground Chernobyl waiting to happen.\"\n\nHanford produced the plutonium to build Fat Man, the atomic weapon that was detonated above Nagasaki at the end of World War II, and for the United States's nuclear arsenal during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1989, after years of dismissing concerns about contamination, the reservation's management finally admitted the site needed to be cleaned up. But cleaning up nuclear waste is difficult. It can't be burned or buried. The plan is to build a waste management plant that will turn the waste into glass, which can be stored away for thousands of years. It's a slow, costly process.\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported, \"Hanford is the worst kind of mess: the kind that humanity is capable of making, but not capable of cleaning up.\"\n\nThe longer the contaminated materials are left, the worse they become. Here's what the nuclear reservation is like.", "description": "Experts have said Hanford Nuclear Reservation is an underground Chernobyl waiting to happen.
