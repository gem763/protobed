We were very careful of how we walked on it.\n\n\"I'm sorry that it's upset people... but I make no apologies about upsetting people, we did our utmost not to damage the horse,\" he added.\n\nThe logo was removed by the owner of the land on Monday morning.\n\nMr Sutherland added: \"I've had lots of people contact me in the past 24 hours. I've had to explain to children this morning - they can't understand how adults have done this.\n\n\"They've defaced something they'd spent their time and effort doing and they're absolutely disgusted.\n\n\"They're disappointed, they're upset, all of the anger's there.\n\n\"Most importantly it's just put them off the group [Extinction Rebellion] itself.\n\n\"You encourage children to do the right thing, you do positive actions and this just hasn't happened. It's completely the opposite.\"\n\nThe monument was restored over the summer with a RAF Chinook helicopter used to transport more than 40 tonnes of chalk up the hill.\n\nThe first attempt was hampered by high winds and driving rain, but the job was eventually finished in August when Year 6 pupils and their parents completed the facelift.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "The Extinction Rebellion logo was laid on the horse at Alton Barnes which was recently restored by children.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7462/production/_109149792_d8e4a05e-c299-4c52-ae0e-654470c31dc7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
