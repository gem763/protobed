La @PFAOficial le dijo al juez que yo fui autor del hackeo a @PatoBullrich en 2017 (mentira: https://t.co/K3X592uEQi), y el juez decidi\u00f3 espiarme, allanarme y detenerme por informar sobre la filtraci\u00f3n. Qu\u00e9 f\u00e1cil que es violar los derechos de un ciudadano. pic.twitter.com/aXGlSTfrqG \u2014 Javier Smaldone (@mis2centavos) October 11, 2019\n\nSmaldone claimed the entire affair was a witch-hunt, describing his arrest and raid as \"political persecution.\"\n\nThe researcher is a well-known cyber-security activist, previously testified in front of the Argentinian Senate against the use of electronic voting machines, and regularly publishes blog posts criticizing the government's plans to use such devices.\n\nSmaldone believes this is the government's revenge for past criticism. The researcher told local news outlet Perfil that he was the third security researcher who had his home raided after reporting vulnerabilities in an electronic voting system developed by Venezuelan company Smartmatic, which the Argentinian government is currently testing for a planned rollout in future elections.\n\nLa Gorra Leaks 2.0\n\nBut according to Argentinian news site Clarin, Smaldone is just one of many suspects who had their homes raided last week, on October 8, with similar house searches taking place in the cities of C\u00f3rdoba, Santa Fe, La Plata, and in the country's capital of Buenos Aires.\n\nArgentinian authorities are looking for a hacker going by the name of La Gorra Leaks 2.0.\n\nOn August 12, this year, the hacker published 5 GB of data, containing over 200,000 PDF files, on the dark web, Telegram, and Twitter.\n\nThe files contained names, surnames, ID numbers, home addresses, telephone numbers, and banking information for Argentinian Federal Police officers.\n\nAt the same time, the hacker also hacked the Twitter account for the Argentine Naval Prefecture (PNA) and tweeted that three Argentinian ships had been hit by missiles fired by British forces [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nAccording to the court documents, Smaldone was one of the first to tweet about the incidents, and authorities seem to believe he is somehow involved.\n\nLa Gorra Leaks 1.0\n\nThis new hacker's name is a reference to the original La Gorra Leaks, a hacker who back in 2017 breached the Twitter accounts of Patricia Bullrich, Minister of Security of Argentina, and tweeted images and files from Minister of Security email inboxes. The same hacker also took over the Twitter account for Argentina's Airport Security Police.\n\nSmaldone was one of the many cyber-security experts who tweeted about the leak and even published an article breaking down the hack on his site.\n\nTwo suspects were eventually arrested for the hacks.\n\nPFA DETUVO A DOS HOMBRES ACUSADOS DE HACKEAR LA CUENTA DE LA MINISTRA DE SEGURIDAD DE LA NACI\u00d3N Y DE LA POLIC\u00cdA DE SEGURIDAD AEROPORTUARIA. pic.twitter.com/03mxEsLwOw \u2014 Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina (@PFAOficial) February 17, 2017\n\nSmaldone's arrest just for tweeting about sensitive issues online isn't the first of its kind in Argentina.
