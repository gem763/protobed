Sure,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cAre there are one or two really good anchors at that organization? Sure. But that doesn\u2019t make it a news organization, that doesn\u2019t make it a journalism endeavor.\u201d\n\nThis is not a one-sided attack, of course. Hannity, for example, often refers to CNN as \u201cfake news\u201d suffering from TDS (\u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d) and once called Stelter \u201ca little pipsqueak,\u201d to name just a few of his barbs.\n\nFox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst jumped into the fray with a lengthy thread pointing to the network\u2019s interviews with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Facebook\u2019s FB, +0.12% Mark Zuckerberg and Turkish President Recep Erdogan as examples of real journalism:", "description": "Jeff Zucker fired shot across the airwaves at rival Fox News during an interview with Brian Stelter in New York on Thursday.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT975_zucker_MG_20191024150900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
