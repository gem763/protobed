Speaking to RT and Sputnik news agency, she said it was hard to believe she was finally on her way back. However, it is probably less shocking than the US accusation that she was a \"foreign agent,\" secretly working for the Russian government.\n\n\"When I was arrested for the first time and put into a big black van, it all felt like a movie \u2013 a bad, ridiculous Hollywood blockbuster,\" she said.\n\nButina's case obviously garnered quite a lot of attention, given it happened in the height of the Russiagate hysteria following accusations that Moscow was supposedly meddling in US internal matters. The US media was quickly flooded with surreal stories, including claims that Butina was using sex to infiltrate US political circles.\n\nIt sounded like something from Alice in Wonderland, or Through the Looking-Glass.\n\nButina denied being a spy and insisted she just was a foreign student making friends. There was zero proof to the contrary and the charges were \"bogus,\" she said. On top of that, the gun activist explained, the prosecution did not even bother to properly translate her tweets.\"The translation was completely horrendous. The phrase 'tech bordering on fantasy' was translated into English as 'secret equipment.'\"You cannot translate it that way!\"\n\nThe FBI questioned Butina for 52 hours, but according to her the whole interrogation was \u201cabsolutely pointless.\u201d From the start, she said that she had no ties with the Russian government and the agents \u201cquickly ran out of questions.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com US not bad but justice system broken: Butina talks about \u2018terrifying\u2019 solitary confinement, vows to fight for inmates\u2019 rights\n\nThe activist recalled that the FBI kept asking the same things about her activities over and over again because \u201cthey just couldn\u2019t believe that people can do good things for no special reason, simply because they believe in friendship between the countries and strive for people\u2019s right for self-protection.\u201d The lengthy interrogation was just for show, to make it look like the investigators \u201cwere doing something serious,\u201d while they had nothing.\n\nBefore her sentencing in April, Butina spent eight months in custody, much of the time in a \"super freezing\" cell in solitary confinement. There was hardly any heating inside, Butina recalls, and most cells had no view from the windows other than a brick wall.\n\nI've spent my 30th birthday staring at the bricks.\n\nThe Russian ultimately chose to plead guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, with some of the term counted as time served. She did it because she did not believe that she would get a fair trial \u2013 especially in a jury trial - after being slandered and demonized by the US media.\n\n\"I would have been tried by the same people who watch the news\u2026 and get 15 years,\" she said. Butina claimed that she would have \"fought till the end\" if she was given a chance to stand trial \"before an international independent court with an objective view on my case.\"\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018It was very hard to bear\u2019: Maria Butina recalls how US media smeared her on TV & prison guards gathered to watch it\n\n\u201cThere is no justice in the US,\u201d Butina said. She recalled that when the judge was announcing her sentence, she first called her \u201ca wonderful woman\u201d and expressed confidence that she wouldn\u2019t commit a crime ever again, but then said that she fully agreed with the prosecutors. \u201cThis is absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just needed a scapegoat to justify the huge money spent on prosecuting a magistrate student. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nButina said that the actual prison term that she got \u201cwas a shock. I was sure that they\u2019d let me go home that very day because there were absolutely no grounds for me to be sentenced.\u201d\n\n\"This is why I prefer not to speak from solitary confinement where no one hears my voice. My fight starts here,\" Butina said, explaining that \"the most important thing for me now is to tell the truth about what happened to me. People have a right to know that.\"\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Very lengthy & painful experience:\u2019 Butina in her first comments after release (VIDEO)\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
