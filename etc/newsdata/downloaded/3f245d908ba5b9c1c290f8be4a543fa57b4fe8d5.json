For naught.\n\nNothing is going Cleveland\u2019s way.\n\nPicked prematurely to be a Super Bowl contender, the Browns reached their bye week with a losing record and as perhaps the NFL\u2019s most perplexing team. In the span of four quarters - or even four minutes - they can look brilliant, buffoonish and bewildering.\n\nIt\u2019s baffling.\n\nThey commit too many penalties, make too many turnovers and do too much griping about the officiating.\n\nDespite their obvious star power and on-paper potential, the Browns (2-4), who wasted a 14-point lead and lost 32-28 on Sunday to the Seattle Seahawks, are simply not playing well enough to win.\n\nDuring a team meeting Monday, Kitchens made it clear to his players that things must change. Immediately.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we have to become a team,\u201d he said, repeating the message he delivered to the Browns. \u201cThe difference between a group and a team is significant. To be a team, you have to do your job and then you bring it together collectively. The better team beat our group yesterday. \u2026\n\n\u201cAll of this talent we have - that has gotten us 2-4. Now, let\u2019s try something different. Let\u2019s try to be a team and see if we can be better moving forward.\u201d\n\nFor the third time this season, Cleveland fans made the same solemn walk of shame from FirstEnergy Stadium they\u2019ve perfected over the past two decades. The Browns again failed to deliver at home, and a team that began the season with high hopes reached a critical juncture just six games in.\n\n\u201cAt 2-4,\u201d Kitchens said, \u201cyou are at the crossroads.\u201d\n\nIt all began so well Sunday for the Browns, who scored touchdowns on their first three drives before the offense bogged down. Cleveland\u2019s next seven possessions went: blocked punt, interception, interception, halftime, fumble, punt, stopped on downs - at the 1-yard line.\n\nThat last drive appeared to end with a TD pass from Baker Mayfield to Landry, who looked as though he extended the ball over the goal line before it was knocked loose. It came during a strange sequence (the Seahawks were called for 12 men on the field) that had officials huddling, coaches complaining, TV viewers begging for a definitive camera angle and no one exactly certain what had happened.\n\nIt was crazy. Kind of like Cleveland\u2019s season so far.\n\nLandry, who left angrily after the game and without addressing the media, spent more than 20 minutes Monday giving an insightful analysis into where the Browns stand - and want to go.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowler said the Browns\u2019 situation reminds him of something he learned early in his athletic career.\n\n\u201cTalent wins games, teams win championships,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about talent. I\u2019ve played on talented teams and we\u2019ve won nothing, and I\u2019ve played on teams that we were disciplined, accountable. We had a team full of leaders - my only playoff team. And then the following year pretty much the same team, but we lacked all of those traits that got us to where we were before.\u201d\n\nRight now, the Browns are stuck where they\u2019ve been for years.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nHanding the ball to Nick Chubb, who gained 122 yards on 20 carries, scored two touchdowns and thoroughly impressed the Seahawks.\n\n\u201cA great player,\u201d said Seattle coach Pete Carroll.\n\nChubb ripped off a 52-yard run and wasn\u2019t going to be denied on his second TD, which came just moments after he got stuff on a fourth-down play.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nMayfield\u2019s 11 interceptions lead the NFL and give him 25 in two seasons, also a league-worst.\n\nKitchens said there are other overlooked factors, and that the turnovers are not all on Mayfield.\n\n\u201cDo I think he can get better with his accuracy? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I think other people around him need to get better? Yes. Do I think I need to get better? Yes.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. had six catches for 101 yards and was targeted 11 times as Kitchens purposely tried to get his top playmaker more chances.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nKitchens is feeling more heat. The first-year coach was defensive about his clock management in the first half.\n\nWith the Browns up 20-12 and driving in the final two minutes, he called a pass play at Seattle\u2019s 10. Mayfield forced a throw to Landry that was picked off in the end zone. The Seahawks then drove 88 yards to pull within two.\n\nKitchens believed the Browns could score twice and doesn\u2019t regret his decision.\n\n\u201cWe need to make a better play call, make a better throw, run a better route,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, I am always going to be aggressive - always.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nMayfield played with a sore hip in the second half. Kitchens said his quarterback was \u201cfine\u201d and doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll miss any practice this week. \u2026 Landry injured his ankle but said the bye week will help his recovery.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n445 - Yards rushing allowed by the Browns in the past two weeks.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any easier as the Browns visit the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots on Oct. 27.\n\n\u201cWe are full of talent,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cHopefully, our talented guys will all become a team, and we will all go up there as one and put our best foot forward.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jarvis Landry jumped up and down on the sideline, flapping his arms while madly urging Browns coach Freddie Kitchens to throw his red challenge flag.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/seahawks_browns_football_08833_c0-28-3000-1778_s1200x700.jpg?926b73206bea950242f6cf6abe3efe644255aad2", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
