O/SING1\n\n- This mirrored the trend in the United States where its gasoline stocks fell 682,000 barrels last week, data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed. TENDERS: Indonesia's Pertamina had sealed a quarterly tender to buy gasoline for October to December delivery at discounts slightly above $1 a barrel to Singapore quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.\n\n- The total volumes concluded were unclear but Pertamina was originally seeking from 100,000 to 250,000 barrels per month of 88-octane grade gasoline a month for the fourth quarter.\n\n- Pertamina, also Asia's top gasoline importer, has an outstanding tender to buy gasoline from the spot market. MOG/TENDA\n\n- India's BPCL in the meantime is looking to buy 40,000 tonnes of gasoline for September to October arrival at Kandla through a tender due to be awarded on Sept. 16.\n\n- BPCL has already bought more 110,000 tonnes of gasoline from the spot market this year for March to September arrival at Mumbai, Kandla and Kochi. MOG/TENDA\n\n- Similarly, India's HPCL is also looking to buy gasoline through a tender due to be awarded on Sept. 16.\n\n- HPCL has however sold 30,000 tonnes of gasoline for Sept. 25-27 loading from Vizag to Trafigura although this could not be independently confirmed.\n\n* CASH DEALS: Seven gasoline trades and two on naphtha.
