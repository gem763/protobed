The international benchmark crude rose 2.5% on Wednesday to settle at $61.17 a barrel, levels not seen since Sept. 30.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 dropped 44 cents, or 0.8%, to $55.53 per barrel. U.S. crude closed 3.3% higher in the previous session.\n\n\u201cOil is seeing profit-taking in Asia after last night\u2019s sharp up-move,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\nU.S. crude inventories fell 1.7 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 18, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for a 2.2 million barrel build, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.\n\nThis was in stark contrast with earlier inventory data released by industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API), which showed a build of 4.5 million barrels in U.S. crude stocks.\n\nThe EIA said the drawdown in weekly stocks came as refineries hiked crude runs and oil imports fell, which prodded a jump in both benchmark crude grades on Wednesday.\n\nBut persistent concerns about weak demand outlook continue to weigh on market sentiment, traders said.\n\n\u201cFlagging global economic growth and rising downside risks have kept global risk appetites measured as traders deliberate weaker fuel demand for the coming term,\u201d said Benjamin Lu, analyst at Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures.\n\nSome market participants said a decline in U.S. product inventories, as shown by the EIA data, could point to underlying demand.\n\n\u201cThe EIA report may be an indication that oil demand is not as bad as a current dreary run of global headline macro data might suggest,\u201d said Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nThe prospects of deeper production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies also helped to support the market.\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, however, said on Wednesday that no formal calls have been made yet to change the current global oil supply deal.\n\nOPEC, Russia and other producers have since January implemented a deal to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2020 to support the market. The producers will meet to review the policy on Dec. 5-6.", "description": "Oil prices dipped on Thursday after sharp gains in the previous session following a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories, with concerns over a weak demand outlook adding to downward pressure.", "authors": ["Koustav Samanta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444323289&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N02F", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
