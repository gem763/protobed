Most, but not all, of the parties contesting the polls have said that they will abolish the tariffs but will introduce other retaliatory measures against Serbia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union see tensions between Belgrade and Pristina as a major threat to regional stability and are pushing for a normalisation of relations.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell, the straight-talking U.S. ambassador to Germany, as special envoy to try to inject new energy into the talks between Belgrade and Pristina.\n\nTwenty years after NATO bombing expelled Serbian forces, Belgrade refuses to recognise Kosovo as independent and, in concert with its ally Russia, has blocked Pristina's membership of international organisations including the United Nations.\n\nIn 2013, Pristina and Belgrade agreed to an EU-mediated dialogue to normalise ties but little progress has been made.\n\nLast year, Kosovan President Hashim Thaci and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic signalled that they might agree to a land swap but they faced strong opposition to the idea domestically and abroad.\n\nIn Kosovo, all three parties LDK, Vetevendosje and PDK said the land swap was not acceptable.\n\nEUROPE'S YOUNGEST POPULATION\n\nKosovo has Europe's youngest population, with an average age of 29, and has seen annual economic growth averaging 4% over the past decade, but it remains poor. Since Pristina won independence from Belgrade in 2008, more than 200,000 Kosovars have emigrated and applied for asylum in the European Union.\n\n\"It hurts me when I see young, educated people from Kosovo coming to Germany because they don't see a better future here,\" said Skender Nekaj, 44, who came from Germany to Kosovo to vote together with seven other family members.\n\nThe public sector is the biggest employer in the country but job applicants typically need political connections or to pay a bribe to find a job.\n\nThe European Union says corruption is \"widespread\" and Transparency International ranks Kosovo as a very corrupt country.\n\n\"If you have money you can buy justice here, if you have money you can buy health because you go to a private clinic. I don't have money. My vote is the only thing I have,\" said Qendrim Agushi, 32, a construction worker who earns 13 euros a day.\n\nThe election will be overseen by more than 34,000 monitors including 100 from the European Union.\n\nPolls open at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT). Preliminary official results are expected by midnight (2200 GMT).
