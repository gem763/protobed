House committee chairmen quickly issued a subpoena to force the envoy to appear before the House next week and produce documents recovered from his personal devices.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, was barred by the administration from appearing in a closed-door session with three House panels investigating Trump\u2019s entreaties to Ukraine. His attorney said Sondland, who had agreed to the interview without a subpoena, was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d to be prevented from testifying.\n\nSondland was to have been asked about text messages released last week that show him and two other U.S. diplomats acting as intermediaries as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate the 2016 U.S. election and a gas company linked to Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s son. Sondland also spoke directly to Trump hours before sending a text message assuring another U.S. envoy that there was nothing untoward about their plans, according to a person familiar with the exchange who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the conversation.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, said Sondland\u2019s no-show was \u201cyet additional strong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sondland\u2019s boss.\n\n\u201cBy preventing us from hearing from this witness and obtaining these documents, the president and secretary of state are taking actions that prevent us from getting the facts needed to protect the nation\u2019s security,\u201d said Schiff, D-Calif. \u201cFor this impeachment inquiry we are determined to find answers.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Schiff\u2019s comments at an event in Seattle, saying it was an \u201cabuse of power\u201d for Trump to thwart witness testimony.\n\nDemocrats believe that Sondland, who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, could provide valuable information. He spoke to Trump in September as diplomats raised questions about why hundreds of millions in security aid to Ukraine was being withheld. After the call, Sondland assured another diplomat in a text message that there were \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind\u201d with Ukraine.\n\nSchiff, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings issued a subpoena late Tuesday demanding that Sondland testify Oct. 16 and provide documents, including additional communications on a personal device that he has turned over to the State Department. Schiff said the department is withholding those communications from Congress.\n\nSondland\u2019s absence on Tuesday raised questions about whether other witnesses called by the committee would appear. Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from the post, is scheduled to testify Friday, and the committee has called two other State Department officials.\n\nTrump indicated Tuesday that it was his decision to stop the deposition, tweeting that he would \u201clove to send Ambassador Sondland\u201d to testify, \u201cbut unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have struggled to investigate Trump and his administration all year as the White House has blocked and ignored subpoenas for documents and testimony. While the Democrats are already in court to force some of that evidence, they are making it clear that they do not intend to wait much longer. Articles of impeachment, including for obstruction, could be drafted by the end of the year.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday, Schiff laid out four parameters of the committee\u2019s investigation. He said the panel is probing whether Trump solicited foreign help from Ukraine for his 2020 reelection; whether a never-realized White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Trump was conditioned on Ukraine conducting investigations; whether U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was conditioned on those investigations; and whether the administration has obstructed justice.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Tuesday that Trump was simply \u201cdoing his job\u201d to prevent corruption in Ukraine. He and other Republicans attacked Schiff for leading what they called an unfair, partisan inquiry.\n\nAcross the Capitol, Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham \u2014 one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders \u2014 said he would call the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to testify about corruption in Ukraine. Giuliani was communicating with Zelenskiy about the investigations that Trump wanted.\n\n\u201cGiven the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\u201d Graham said in a tweet.\n\nGiuliani said he was \u201cvery interested\u201d in the invitation but would need to review matters of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege before committing to appear.\n\nHouse Democrats have subpoenaed Giuliani for documents, but Giuliani said he would not cooperate with them.\n\nText messages released by House Democrats last week show Sondland worked with another of Trump\u2019s diplomats, former Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker, to get Ukraine to agree to investigate any potential interference in the 2016 U.S. election and to probe the Ukrainian energy company that appointed Biden\u2019s son Hunter to its board.\n\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.", "description": "Escalating his fight against Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump flouted Democratic warnings about impeachable conduct Tuesday in blocking...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS910_sondla_ZG_20191008190852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
