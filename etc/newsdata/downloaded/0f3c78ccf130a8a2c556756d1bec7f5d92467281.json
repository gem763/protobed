U.S. efforts to woo Pyongyang have relied heavily on lockstep coordination with the government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past two years.\n\nDavid Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces officer and senior North Korea analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the \u201ccracks in the armor of the alliance\u201d between the U.S. and South Korea \u2014 commonly referred to as the Republic of Korea, or ROK \u2014 will affect the North Korea policy and could worsen dramatically.\n\n\u201cThere will be no successful outcome on the Korean Peninsula or in Northeast Asia unless there is a foundation of a strong ROK/U.S. alliance and Japanese/U.S. alliance and effective trilateral coordination, collaboration and cooperation,\u201d Mr. Maxwell wrote in comments circulated to reporters Friday.\n\nBy some measures, the cracks in the armor have been widening for several years while Washington turned a blind eye on the assumption that Japan and South Korea would find a way to work together as fellow democracies aligned against the prospect of an increasingly influential and militarized communist China.\n\nBut the two nations have a tortured past that includes Japan\u2019s colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. South Koreans still bristle at Japan\u2019s treatment of the country, first as a colony in the early 20th century and then during World War II.\n\nThe government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe contends Tokyo has long since made reparations for its actions and has become outraged over what it sees as an attempt by the Moon administration in Seoul to revive historical grievances for domestic political gain.\n\nThe Japan-based Nikkei Asian Review has pointed to the specific issue of South Korean court rulings since Mr. Moon came to office that have ordered the Japanese companies Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal to compensate the families of South Korean workers for unpaid labor during World War II.\n\nFriction over the issue escalated late last year when Tokyo suddenly accused a South Korean navy destroyer of targeting a Japanese aircraft with fire-control radar. The incident triggered rising acrimony as well as frustration among South Koreans that the Trump administration appeared to have sided with the Abe government in the clash.\n\nTokyo moved again this summer by announcing trade sanctions over what it said were more historical compensation demands from Seoul, targeting in particular exports vital to South Korea\u2019s world-class technology sector.\n\nThe Japanese trade curbs in turn have triggered an outburst of anti-Japan sentiment in South Korea, marked by street protests, cancellations of vacations to Japan and widespread boycotts of Japanese beer, clothes and other products.\n\nThe most provocative move was Seoul\u2019s Aug. 22 announcement that it was abandoning the General Security of Military Information Agreement on sharing intelligence with Tokyo. Mr. Moon approved the move despite the certain outrage it would spark in Washington.\n\nMr. Cronin suggested that Mr. Moon\u2019s move reflected a growing unhappiness in Seoul with the Trump administration as well, as the euphoria over the outreach to North Korea has given way to a diplomatic slog.\n\nHe noted Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated demands that South Korea pay more for the roughly 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country. Mr. Trump has also denigrated long-standing U.S.-South Korean military drills and given Pyongyang a pass on tests of short-range missiles that cannot reach the U.S. but threaten South Korea directly.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus tweeted last week that canceling the intelligence accord \u201cwill make defending [South] Korea more complicated and increase risk to U.S. forces.\u201d U.S. security officials are reportedly skipping the South Korean Defense Ministry\u2019s annual Seoul Defense Dialogue this week.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper last week took an evenhanded stance. He told reporters he was \u201cvery disappointed that both parties are engaged in this,\u201d but he also suggested that the matter remained an internal spat that Tokyo and Seoul should resolve.\n\nGen. Joseph F. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared with Mr. Esper at the Pentagon and said the intelligence pact\u2019s demise could be overcome from a tactical perspective even if South Korea and Japan remain at odds.\n\n\u201cWe have other ways of sharing information,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, none as effective as a very strong bilateral information-sharing agreement between the two countries, but there are other mechanisms in place to allow us to deal with alliance crisis or contingency.\u201d\n\nMr. Cronin suggested that South Korea\u2019s defiance on the intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, which U.S. officials spent more than two decades trying to establish, could be reversed if Washington takes a more sensitive tack with Seoul.\n\n\u201cIf that means de-escalating our demands on South Korea for them to share more of the burden for defense spending, then so be it \u2026,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth getting even a few more billion dollars out of our ally if you\u2019re going to break the whole security architecture that\u2019s advancing our interests and values across the region.\u201d\n\nKey administration officials including Randall Schriver, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, and David Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, \u201care thinking hard about this,\u201d Mr. Cronin said.\n\n\u201cBut I also think everybody wants to please the boss, and the boss wants a big win that shows our allies are willing to pay,\u201d Mr. Cronin said. \u201cI say be more creative. I\u2019m not letting the South Koreans off the hook. I\u2019m just saying the U.S. should consider being more agile and flexible on this than what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen what, if any, lengths the administration is willing to go to persuade South Korea to mend its dispute with Japan.\n\nMr. Schriver expressed discontent that the Moon government had not forewarned the U.S. of its plans. He said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies forum last week that Seoul has a \u201cserious misapprehension\u201d about the security challenges in northeast Asia, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nBut there are also concerns that too much U.S. pressure could trigger anti-American sentiment in South Korea. The pollster Realmeter found last week that roughly 55% of South Koreans said they agreed with the Moon government\u2019s decision to scrap the intelligence-sharing accord.\n\nAn editorial in Chosun Ilbo, a generally conservative newspaper in Seoul, argued that U.S. officials have \u201cpretty much sided with Tokyo\u201d on the issue, but it also chided the Moon government. Summoning the U.S. ambassador was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and a sign that the government \u201cwill also now incite anti-American sentiment\u201d ahead of parliamentary elections next year.\n\nThe bottom line, the editorial said, is that \u201cthe U.S.-Korea alliance, which remains the sole foundation of [South Korea\u2018s] defense, is being shaken.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
