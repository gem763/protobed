They were dubbed the \u201cLovers of Modena\u201d and have become synonymous with heterosexual romance, their image now often used in Italy to symbolize undying love.\n\nWhen they were discovered, archeologists said the bones were in such a state of decay that the usual genetic-based methods used in confirming the biological sex of ancient remains was of no use. Still, one of the figures was slightly smaller than the other, so it was assumed they were male and female. The individuals did not die in situ\u2014their hands were placed holding each other's by whoever buried them, most likely to represent a relationship between the two people. Eleven people were buried in the cemetery where they were found, all initially thought to be soldiers and victims of an ancient war, based on wounds consistent with battles. The consensus among anthropologists was that the presumed female hand-holder was the lover of one of the warriors.\n\nThis week, scientists with the University of Bologna announced the \u201cLovers of Modena\u201d were actually both biologically male, thanks to a revolutionary process they used to examine tooth enamel. A certain peptide that is present only in males was present in all 16 teeth extracted from both skeletons. The scientists also found that only one of the 11 individuals buried in the cemetery was female, and she wasn\u2019t holding anyone\u2019s hand.\n\nThen, suddenly, the hand-holders weren\u2019t lovers at all: Italian archaeologists insisted that surely they were brothers or cousins who died in battle.\n\nArchaeologist Federico Lugli, who led the Bologna study, conceded that while it was impossible to know if the two men were lovers, he highly doubted it. \u201cIn late-ancient times it is unlikely that homosexual love could be recognized so clearly by the people who prepared the burial,\u201d he told The Daily Beast by email. \u201cGiven that the two individuals have similar ages, they could be relatives, probably siblings or cousins.\u201d\n\nHomosexuality was well documented in Roman times. Emperor Nero married women to bear children, but he had sex with men for pleasure. He publicly married two men, Pythagoras and, years later, Sporo, who was castrated and made to wear a woman\u2019s gown during the ceremony, according to historical accounts by Pliny the Elder, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio, whose writings account for much of what we know about ancient Rome.\n\nThe ancient Roman Empire legal tome Lex Scantinia sets out a series of regulations for men having sex with other men, including that freeborn Romans\u2014that is to say those who were not slaves or war prisoners\u2014could not take a passive role when having sex with a man. But by no means did it make same sex relationships illegal and it was quite common for noble Romans to have male lovers in addition to wives who fulfilled the traditional role of childbearing.\n\nIn the case of the skeletons of the Lovers of Modena, it seems historians are not willing to concede that two individuals who were once thought to be romantically linked when they were presumed to be male and female are likely not now that their biological sex is the same.\n\n\u201cThe burial of two men hand in hand was certainly not a common practice in the late-ancient era,\u201d Lugli says. \u201cWe believe that this choice symbolizes a particular relationship between the two individuals, but we do not know the nature of it.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of examples of ancient figures buried in all manner of embrace\u2014most of which have been positively identified through genetic sampling as male and female, but not all. The embracing skeletons found in Petrykiv village in western Ukraine are thought to be from a woman who committed suicide to be buried with her man, but the analysis was made based on jewelry and size. In 2015, a couple of 6,000-year-old spooning skeletons were found in Greece, though no one has any idea yet why they were in such a position. Their bones were identified as biologically male and female. Usually, when couples are found buried together, the first question is why they died at the same time and if one was sacrificed to be buried with the other. Now, thanks to the new dental enamel science, archaeologists can go back to other ancient lovers to find out more about who they were.", "description": "Archeo ModenaROME\u2014In 2009, the straight world swooned when archaeologists discovered two ancient skeletons from between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D. holding hands in a grave in Modena, Italy.
