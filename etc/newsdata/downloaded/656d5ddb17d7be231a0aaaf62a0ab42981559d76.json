Arrivals are up and conditions on the islands are tragic for the people who are there,\" Avramopoulos said. \"The Statement continues to apply and all sides are obliged to follow.\"\n\nRefugee reception camps on Greek islands in the Aegean have filled to overflowing [Byron Smith/Getty Images]\n\nThere were about 50,000 asylum seekers in Greece when the Statement came into force. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), Greece had 88,750 at the end of August. Returns to Turkey during that time have numbered a mere 1,806.\n\nOn Monday, the Greek cabinet announced plans to speed up deportations dramatically, returning 10,000 asylum seekers back to Turkey next year.\n\nRefugee reception camps on Greek islands in the Aegean have filled to overflowing.\n\nMoria camp on the island of Lesbos was originally built for 1,200 and was later reconfigured to house 3,100. It now has a record 13,000, as the rate of arrivals from Turkey picked up last month.\n\nA fire that broke out in the camp on September 29 killed at least one person and caused a riot that had to be put down with water cannon.\n\nMihalis Chrysohoidis, Greek citizens' protection minister, said Moria would \"continue to stigmatise Europe\" unless returns were increased in line with arrivals.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to \"flood Europe\" with refugees if he did not receive more financial support from Europe.\n\nErdogan also seeks international support for a plan to resettle 3.6 million refugees on Turkish soil in a 30km- deep buffer zone (19 miles) in northern Syria.\n\nInternal divisions\n\nEurope also has internal problems with burden-sharing. According to current asylum rules, refugees must apply for international protection in the first EU country they reach.\n\nEver since a relocation programme ended in September 2017, there is no mechanism to move asylum seekers from front-line states after arriving on their shores.\n\n\"If we don't help Greece and the countries at the external borders we will have an uncontrollable migration policy which will be a dead-end,\" Seehofer said.\n\n\"If we don't face it in an organised way, the immigrants will appear in a disorganised way all over Europe,\" he said.\n\nHis remarks were directed towards Austria, Hungary, Poland and Denmark, who have refused to take any refugees from Greece. Slovakia relocated 16 and the Czech Republic 12.\n\n\"We're not helping Greece now, we're helping Europe. It's a big problem and it's everyone's problem,\" Seehofer said.\n\nChrysohoidis also renewed calls for a common European asylum policy as a vital component of managing refugee flows to the continent.\n\n\"We need solidarity and proportional burden-sharing,\" he said.\n\nOne of the reasons Greece has so many asylum seekers is that it has played by the book when it comes to asylum interviews, resisting European pressure to exclude anyone from the process on the basis of nationality.\n\nMonday's cabinet meeting suggested that this may change.\n\nA briefing note said that an upcoming revision of asylum law will include \"induction into the asylum system only of those who have a refugee profile\".", "description": "Greece, Germany and the European Commission urge Turkey to fully implement its migration agreement with the EU.", "authors": ["John Psaropoulos"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/283e5b0dfb7544679ed93bb5f3c7a419_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
