But in fact they have already been suspended on the southern side of the border for six months in an attempt to pacify the North around the time of an inter-Korean summit in April.\n\nMilitary insiders worry that the Northwest Islands Defense Command, which was established in 2011 to deal effectively with local provocations by the North like the previous year's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, has effectively been incapacitated.\n\nWhen the K-9 live-fire drills on the islands were suspended, soldiers traveled all the way to the mainland to train to fill the vacuum, a government source said Tuesday.", "description": "S.Korea Has Conducted No Artillery Drills Since April", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2018/10/17/2018101701541_0.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-17"}
