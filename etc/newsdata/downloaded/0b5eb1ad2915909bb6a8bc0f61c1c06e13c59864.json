The storm knocked out power, blocked dozens of roads and transformed streets into rivers.\n\nBy the afternoon, the storm\u2019s core had left the Outer Banks, and while some gusty winds remained, Dorian had largely moved past the Mid-Atlantic shortly before 5 p.m., according to The Washington Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang. Still, forecasters warned, the storm posed a threat to areas in its wake.\n\n\u201cLife-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds will continue along portions of the North Carolina coast for the next several hours,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said late Friday afternoon. The storm is also projected to scrape across eastern New England on its way north.\n\nStorm surge flooding also began in Norfolk on Friday afternoon, and forecasters warned that water could continue to rise as high tide neared.\n\n[Dorian slams into the Outer Banks with wind, storm surge flooding]\n\nVideos from the Outer Banks area showed water that stretched up trees and swamped roadways. The storm drove a seven-foot surge into the Outer Banks, south of Nags Head. A gauge on idyllic Hatteras Island recorded inundation that topped five feet, more than enough to be considered major flooding.\n\nOcracoke Island now.

Even with that, the storm rattled eastern parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina on its way north before crossing over the Tar Heel State.\n\nEmergency officials urged area residents to get to the highest points in their houses. With the bridges to the islands impassable, first responders will likely need to use helicopters to transport food and supplies to hard-hit communities and to get victims of the hurricane out.\n\n[In the Bahamas, waiting for relief amid the bodies]\n\n\n\nA fallen tree and flood waters sit in a hotel parking lot after Hurricane Dorian swept through, in Wilmington, N.C., on Friday. (Jonathan Drake/Reuters)\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said that there have been no reports of serious injuries or fatalities on the Outer Banks.\n\n\u201cIf the collected will and prayers of the people of North Carolina could have pushed that thing off course, it would be way in the ocean by now,\u201d Cooper told people at a feeding station at the Warner Temple AME Zion Church on the north side of Wilmington Friday afternoon.\n\nHe urged prayers for the people of Okracoke, \u201cwhere the storm is continuing to rage. There are hundreds of people trapped on that island now, flooding from storm surge has occurred there.\u201d\n\nRescuers are ready to go in by air as soon as the weather breaks, he said.\n\n\u201cWe know these storms now, unfortunately, are a new normal for us,\u201d he said. Referring to hurricanes Florence and Matthew, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three hurricanes in the state of North Carolina in less than three years.\u201d\n\nCooper said although he issued a mandatory evacuation order, he leaves it up to local officials to enforce it.\n\n\u201cWe expect mandatory evacuation orders to be obeyed, sometimes they are not,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople on the Outer Banks are often a hardy bunch. It\u2019s not unusual for some people on the barrier islands not to leave. That\u2019s something for local officials to decide.\u201d\n\nState transportation officials said there were 67 roads left impassable by high water and downed trees as of Friday afternoon \u2014 compared with the 750 road closures reported at the same time during Hurricane Florence last year.\n\nCommunities in the southeastern part of the state, many of which are still recovering from severe flooding during that storm, breathed a sigh of relief, even as Dorian\u2019s onslaught continued.\n\nMore than 200,000 North Carolina residents were without power Friday morning, and some 4,500 people had sought refuge from the storm in shelters. Cooper urged those who had evacuated to hold off rushing back to their homes; downed power lines and potential flash floods remain deadly threats.\n\nAuthorities said that on Ocracoke Island, historic water levels were reported. Emergency personnel outside the island could not immediately reach Ocracoke, where the water was five to six feet above ground, Hyde County spokesman Donnie Shumate said Friday morning.\n\nTransportation officials said that with all of Ocracoke Island experiencing severe flooding, they had closed North Carolina Highway 12, which runs through the Outer Banks. Power outages were also reported to affect all of Hatteras and Ocracoke islands.\n\nOn Ocracoke, hundreds of people who remained on the island are trying to get to higher ground after a sudden, massive storm surge roared through the tiny village.\n\n\u201cWe have an absolute major disaster,\u201d Peter Vankevich, who runs the Ocracoke Observer, the island\u2019s main news source. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I cannot overemphasize the impact here. I hear up in Hatteras things are actually worse.\u201d\n\nVankevich said waters from Pamlico Sound came rushing into the village of roughly 600 year-round residents around 7:30 a.m. Friday.\n\n\u201cThis storm surge came in amazingly quick,\u201d he said.\n\nVankevich said people throughout the village are reporting similar conditions. He expects almost everyone on the island has lost their cars and said that several homes, including his, were damaged by falling trees.\n\nAmanda Faulkner, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in the North Carolina area, said it sent three helicopters to the island around 10 a.m. Friday to search for residents in danger.\n\nThey flew one man reporting chest pains to Carolina East Hospital in New Bern, N.C. They did not plan additional flights because no one else appeared to be in distress.\n\nSix helicopters from local, state and federal agencies were available throughout the day. It is the only inhabited Outer Banks island accessible only by boat or plane, making it particularly challenging to evacuate and reach during storms.\n\n\u201cWhen an evacuation takes place, the ferries take everyone out who wants to leave until the winds get too bad,\u201d Shumate said. \u201cAfter that, we have to wait until the Coast Guard clears the channel path.\u201d\n\nOfficials estimated that 800 people were still on the island after Dorian struck, and they were prioritizing evacuating the elderly, people with medical conditions or anyone who needed urgent attention. They planned to take them to an inland shelter. Ferries to carry the rest back inland and bring in emergency supplies were expected to head to the island Saturday if winds slow down.\n\nDorian left the worst damage in Ocracoke of any hurricane in recent history.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a couple of old timers saying they can\u2019t remember it being so bad. It happened very quickly,\u201d Shumate said. \u201cThere\u2019s still waist-deep water to wade through. They had sustained 90 miles per hour wind on top of the flooding.\u201d\n\nSam Walker, news director at Beach 104 and OBX Today, said Friday afternoon that waters from Dorian\u2019s powerful storm surge were receding quickly, but added that winds are still strong.\n\nDamage reports were also coming in from throughout the island. Walker said two piers lost large sections in Avalon and Nags Head, where about 75 feet from the end of pier was torn off.\n\n\u201cIt was fine four hours ago, but the middle of Avalon pier got washed out, and the debris may have knocked out the section at Nags Head,\u201d he said. \u201cThe debris field is all up and down the beach.\u201d\n\nEnd of Nags Head Pier, about 75 feet, knocked out a short time ago. Debris from Avalon Pier to the north has washed up here and against NH Pier. #obx #Dorian pic.twitter.com/QoweYDOME3 \u2014 Sam Walker OBX Today\ud83c\udf99\ud83d\udcfb\ud83d\udcf0 (@SamWalkerOBX) September 6, 2019\n\nSome other areas felt they had been spared the worst of Dorian\u2019s wrath.\n\nMyrtle Beach, S.C., began preparing for Dorian when officials saw the early forecasts: hurricane-force winds, massive storm surge, rain that would surely flood the streets. That was Saturday. By Thursday, though, the powerful cyclone had stayed about 50 miles off the South Carolina coast, sparing Myrtle Beach from its worst impacts.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s mother nature,\u201d Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune said Friday. \u201cSo even the best forecasts may not be what we actually see. We were very, very blessed not to get what was forecasted.\u201d\n\nAt least two tornadoes touched down in the area, and strong winds felled trees across the city, leaving thousands without power. But by Friday morning, the sun was shining, and city trucks were clearing debris from the roads.\n\n\u201cWe are in the cleanup efforts now, and fortunately there is not much to clean up,\u201d Bethune said. \u201cWe look at that as a gift.\u201d\n\nIn eastern North Carolina\u2019s Onslow County, Emergency Services Director Norman Bryson said Friday morning that the Dorian left \u201cminimal damage\u201d and that officials received far fewer emergency calls overnight than on a normal weeknight.\n\nA swiftwater rescue team that mobilized overnight to save people from dangerous floodwaters during Hurricane Florence stayed put as hurricane force winds struck the county early Friday morning.\n\n[As North Carolina focuses on getting ahead of hurricanes, some residents are hesitant to move]\n\nWhen they drove around in trucks to survey flood-prone areas, all they found were a few knocked-over trees, some standing water in grass, and a bent mailbox. One sedan was submerged in the shoulder of a road with foot-deep water, but the occupants apparently escaped unscathed.\n\n\u201cThis is light compared to some of the damage I\u2019ve seen, this ain\u2019t nothing,\u201d said Thomas Goff of Onslow Fire and Rescue. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pop-up thunderstorms do more damage.\u201d\n\nOther areas that had watched Dorian\u2019s path felt similarly spared. In southeast North Carolina, where Dorian passed overnight, minimal damage was initially reported. A spokeswoman for New Hanover County, which includes Wilmington, called the area relatively lucky, just with trees down and minor flooding, although crews are just going out to fully assess the area.\n\nSome rushed back when the storm had passed, and roadways reopened. As soon as the bridge to Carolina Beach and Kure Beach opened at 9 a.m., motorists flooded across the river to get to their homes, businesses and the ocean.\n\nRichard Lang, 68, of Kure Beach came to the ocean to check out the waves after getting his morning coffee. Once a surfer himself, he said he quit \u201conce I got old and decrepit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get 100-year storms about every other year now,\u201d he observed. \u201cI could just about predict what would happen with this one. When they start bouncing off Florida, we get them every time. That big hook of Cape Fear sticks out right there and catches them.\u201d\n\nKaplan and Berman reported from Washington.
