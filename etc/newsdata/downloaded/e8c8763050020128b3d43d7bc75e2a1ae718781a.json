This kind of humility was not related to I.Q. measures or political affiliation, she found; it was strongly linked to curiosity, reflection and open-mindedness.\n\nIn another, ongoing study, Dr. Krumrei Mancuso had 587 American adults complete questionnaires intended to measure levels of intellectual humility. The participants rated how much they agreed with various statements, including \u201cI feel small when others disagree with me on topics that are close to my heart,\u201d and \u201cFor the most part, others have more to learn from me than I have to learn from them.\u201d Those who scored highly on humility \u2014 not that they\u2019d boast about it \u2014 also scored lower on measures of political and ideological polarization, whether conservative or liberal.\n\nOther research has found that people who score high for humility are less aggressive and less judgmental toward members of other religious groups than are less-humble people, even and especially after being challenged about their own religious views.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Health Psychology-Humility-Pride-Behavior.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
