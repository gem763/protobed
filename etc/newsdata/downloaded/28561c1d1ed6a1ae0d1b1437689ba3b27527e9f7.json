For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Washington Nationals were quietly making plans for a parade route, ordering the perfect vintage champagne, and making sure all of the nation\u2019s finest dignitaries were on hand for the historic moment.\n\nReally, they thought they planned for everything.\n\nWell, someone forgot the memo to bring along the bats from Houston.\n\nThe Houston Astros shut down the Nats\u2019 offense for the third consecutive game Sunday night, winning 7-1, and now are just one victory away from their second World Series championship in three years.\n\nThe Nats, after scoring 17 runs in their first two victories at Houston, were limited to just one for the third consecutive game, and now trail 3 games to 2 as the World Series returns to Houston.\n\nThe game will be remembered for the jarring text message that starter Max Scherzer sent to Nats GM Mike Rizzo and trainer Paul Lessard at 11:30 in the morning, letting them know he was in excruciating pain from neck and back spasms, and couldn\u2019t pitch.\n\nNationals starting pitcher Joe Ross gave up four runs on two homers in Game 5. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up this morning I was completely locked up,\u2019\u2019 Scherzer said. \u201cIt became impossible just to do any menial task whatsoever today. I couldn't get out of bed. I had to just basically fall out of bed. Just couldn't even move my arm. I just knew at that point I was in a really bad spot.\n\n\u201cI've pitched through so much crap in my career that that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.\n\n\u201cThis is just a little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into a giant thing.\u2019\u2019\n\nDespite the terrible news, the Nats still believed they were going to win this game, with Rizzo telling everyone that would listen it would only be the latest chapter to this storied season.\n\n\u201cWhen we got the news this morning,\u2019\u2019 Rizzo said, \u201cit was, 'Ok, the first pitch is going to be at 8:07, whether we have Max Scherzer or not. What are you going to do?\n\n\u201cI wish it was Scherzer, (Stephen) Strasburg and (Anibal) Sanchez, but it\u2019s not. We got to present a united front. This is we, instead of a me type-of-thing. This is us against the world. That\u2019s what we got.\n\n\u201cBut I also said, 'You need to get more than four hits and one run to win any of these damn games.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, by the end of the night, they got four hits and one run.\n\nYet again.\n\nThe loss certainly can\u2019t be blamed on emergency starter Joe Ross, who kept them in the game for five innings, but they could have called on Walter Johnson, and it wouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nIf the Nats can\u2019t push runs across the plate, what difference does it make who\u2019s pitching for them?\n\nAstros co-ace Gerrit Cole didn\u2019t give them a chance, giving up just three hits, and not surrendering his first run until Juan Soto\u2019s seventh-inning home run.\n\nThe Nats will have Strasburg go in Game 6 going against AL Cy Young favorite Justin Verlander, but they better find some offense in a hurry to keep their season alive.\n\n\u201cEverybody says you\u2019re playing with house money,\u2019\u2019 Rizzo said. \u201cBull ... We want to win the World Series.\n\n\u201cWe put this team together not to win the wild card, or the division series, but to win the World Series.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of season that you write a book about.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis is a team that lost Bryce Harper to free agency in the offseason.\n\nA team that was buried back in May with a 19-31 record.\n\nGAME 5: Max Scherzer scratched from start\n\nHELLO: Trump booed at Game 5 of World Series\n\nIt\u2019s a team that was four outs away from being eliminated in the wild-card game.\n\nA team that was six outs from going home in the NL Division Series.\n\nThey aren\u2019t about to let an injury stop them now.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re every bit as good as that team,\u2019\u2019 Rizzo said, gesturing towards the Astros\u2019 bench. \u201cI thought we were every bit as good as the Dodgers. These are super teams, and I think we can play with all of them.\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, they better learn how to hit with them.\n\nThe Astros outscored the Nats\u2019 19-3 in the three games at Nationals Park, with a trio of two-run homers, courtesy of Jordan Alvarez, Carlos Correa and George Springer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve dealt with all year,\u2019\u2019 Nats outfielder Adam Eaton said, \u201cgetting punched in the face and coming back.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need to get punched in the face in order to get back in the fight.\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, they better hurry, because this fight is about to end.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "After losing the first two games of the World Series, the Astros have won the last three and are now on the brink of a World Series title.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
