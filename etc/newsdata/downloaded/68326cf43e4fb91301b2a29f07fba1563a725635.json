My sister and I are his executors and we have a UK grant of probate, however, this doesn't hold much weight in the US.\n\nDue to this, we seem to have hit a brick wall in updating the US deeds for the land into our names with a view to selling.\n\nI have all the necessary deeds and tax payment receipts and records prior to and since the land became my father's responsibility, who purchased this off my late grandfather before he passed away.\n\nFlorida land: We inherited the land from our father but are struggling to claim ownership (stock image)\n\nDuring which, documentation was co-signed by his wife and my grandmother, who was the executor/power of attorney for my late grandfather.\n\nWe are paying the annual taxes and the county department are aware that we are managing our father's estate, however, they are unable to offer any form of advice/support in helping us sell. I have visited the US once and have spent countless hours researching and speaking to realtors, with no joy.\n\nWhat can we do? G.M. via email\n\nGary Rycroft, a solicitor at Joseph A Jones & Co LLP replies: I am sorry about your bereavement.\n\nYou say that you and your sisters are the executors named in your father's will and have obtained a Grant of Probate.\n\nThis is the legal document which gives you both the legal authority to deal with the assets in his estate.\n\nHowever, it will be a Grant of Probate issued by the Probate Registry in England & Wales and so has legal standing in that jurisdiction only.\n\nThis means that, as you have found, it is not of much help in releasing your father's assets in the state of Florida, US.\n\nWhere a person has what is known as immovable property (usually land and buildings) in more than one jurisdiction (country) it is often good advice to make a will in each jurisdiction.\n\nIf a person does that, it is also important to ensure that one will (say made in England) does not contradict or revoke another will made by the same person elsewhere (say in Florida).\n\nThis can be done by using an appropriate form of words in both wills.\n\nA solicitor experienced in cross border or multi-jurisdictional issues may assist with such matters.\n\nThe Law Society 'Find a Solicitor' tool is a good starting point to finding a solicitor to help you.\n\nIt is good news that you know where your father's Florida assets are located, that you have the deeds and you have been paying the necessary taxes.\n\nHowever, in Florida, as in most jurisdictions, a Grant of Probate is required to release land held in the sole name of the deceased to the deceased's executors and then on to the deceased's rightful beneficiaries.\n\nIn your case it seems your father made a will in England but not in Florida.\n\nSometimes a Grant of Probate obtained in the deceased's 'home' jurisdiction may be what is known as 're-sealed' in a foreign jurisdiction.\n\nIn other cases, re-sealing is not permitted and a new separate Grant of Probate must be obtained in addition to the Grant already obtained for the will in the 'home' jurisdiction.\n\nThe reader's late father had property in Port Charlotte, Florida but is struggling to sell it off\n\nA realtor (in effect a US estate agent) will not be able to help you with this process.\n\nYou need to consult a Florida Attorney who specialises in Probate matters. Note every state in the US is a separate jurisdiction, so you do need a Florida Attorney rather than say a New York or California one.\n\nA Florida Attorney will be able to advise you if you can re-seal the Grant of Probate you already have or need to obtain a new Grant.\n\nMy own experience of US-based estate assets is that you will need a new Grant of Probate. You should be offered a fixed fee for this service.\n\nI do have great sympathy for your situation. Indeed, I find that the issues which arise on death with regard to foreign immovable property mean that many UK based clients seek to sell or make lifetime gifts of such property before death, so that the complexities your case highlight can be avoided.\n\nA final issue to think about is inheritance tax. When a person who dies who is domiciled in the UK, their executors are responsible for calculating and paying to HMRC in this country any inheritance tax arising on the value of the deceased's worldwide assets.\n\nSo the value of your father's assets in Florida are relevant to the amount of Inheritance Tax (if any) payable in the UK.\n\nThe UK does have double taxation treaties with many countries, including the US, so if you have to pay any inheritance tax elsewhere in the world it can be offset against tax payable in the UK and vice versa.\n\nFlorida does not have a Death Tax but Florida estates are liable for a Federal (US wide) Estate Tax.\n\nAs in the UK certain limits apply so again the specialist advice of a Florida Attorney will be required to establish if any such tax is payable in this case.\n\nPort Charlotte is 100 miles south of Tampa in Florida and has a population of about 55,000\n\nIan Bond, Director and head of trusts and estates at Talbots Law, replies: You will need to make contact with a Florida qualified lawyer to go through the process to obtain the grant and then liquidate the assets for them. That won't be the end of the story.\n\nAs non-US-citizens not domiciled in the US you may be subject to federal taxes; US real estate tangible property physically located in the US, are subject to federal estate tax. You will need to take specialist advice on the tax that they will have to pay.\n\nYou have two options \u2013 first to look for a global law or accountancy firm with offices in both the UK and Florida and enquire if they can receive instructions in the UK and transfer those to a colleague on the ground in Florida to deal with or, second, to directly instruct a Florida lawyer and/or accountant to act for you.\n\nYou should first speak to an international organisation such as the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP) who have members all over the world.\n\nLike me, all STEP members are individually accredited as being specialists in dealing with tax and estate succession in their own jurisdiction.\n\nThey would be able to recommend a professional in Florida who can assist in navigating the process.", "description": "My sister and I are my late fathers executors and we have a UK grant of probate, however, this doesn't hold much weight in the US.
