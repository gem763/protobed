That accomplishment led to an epic clubhouse celebration, a raucous bash that World Series champions would struggle to top.\n\nCue the party poopers.\n\n\u201cAct like you\u2019ve been there before,\u201d they sniffed on social media. \u201cCelebrate when you actually win something.\u201d\n\nNo offense to any grouches, killjoys or sourpusses, but please go far away and stay there.\n\nSomething\u2019s wrong with your ticker if it didn\u2019t get toasty at the sight of second baseman Brian Dozier, shirtless and singing in Spanish, surrounded by Latino teammates dousing him with beer as they sung along. Your facial muscles need electric stimulation if they didn\u2019t reflexively form a smile as Celebrator-in-Chief Gerardo \u201cBaby Shark\u201d Parra was in the middle of jubilant teammates clapping to the infectious children\u2019s song.\n\nThe scenes from Nationals Park after Washington beat Philadelphia \u2014 and Pittsburgh beat the Chicago Cubs (on the centerfield video screen) \u2014 epitomized unbridled joy.\n\nStarting pitcher Anibal Sanchez turned into a different sort of whistleblower, leading a conga line through the clubhouse. Centerfielder Victor Robles and an unidentified teammate engaged in some up-close dancing and gyrating that was funny, if a bit uncomfortable.\n\nIt was all too much for cyberspace complainers who frown on such joy unless a title has been secured. According to that school of thought, spraying champagne and carrying on is reserved for division winners, followed by league champions, and, ultimately, World Series victors.\n\nOne whiner on Twitter posited that Tom Brady and the New England Patriots don\u2019t engage in such revelry for simply reaching the playoffs. Another was confused by a celebration so boisterous it easily could be mistaken for Fall Classic carousing.\n\nI\u2019ll address the latter later. But comparing football to baseball is like comparing dimes to dollars.\n\nNFL teams play one-tenth of the games that MLB teams play. Quite a bit of emotion builds up over a six-month season that contains just a handful of days off. To be among the 10 teams that advance, opposed to the 20 that start vacation, is to experience a release unrivaled in the NFL or other major leagues.\n\nThough I suspect the Nationals will be more subdued if they advance to the National League Division Series next week, I don\u2019t care if they repeat Tuesday\u2019s wingding. With the potential for three more rounds of celebration after that, they might want to pace themselves. But I\u2019m not going to suggest they slow down just because an abundance of parties could be boring and repetitive. That would be a great problem.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I understand \u201cact like you\u2019ve been there before\u201d in certain contexts.\n\nIt works well in business negotiations that involve figures beyond your wildest dreams. The same is true for very formal social settings, unless you want to stick out as an uncultured bumpkin. And I strongly recommend the posture if you find yourself in shady environments with dubious characters.\n\nBut I\u2019ve always had a problem with the philosophy\u2019s original use. Legendary college football coach Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant supposedly uttered the quote in 1967, an edict issued to a kick returner who danced after scoring a touchdown.\n\nTelling players not to celebrate (or how to celebrate) \u2014 whether touchdowns or National League wild cards \u2014 is to rob them of individual expression.\n\nYou want to simply hand the ball to an official or shake hands with teammates within a dry clubhouse, great. But if you want to devise elaborate end zone routines or soak everyone in reach with bottles of champagne, that\u2019s great, too.\n\nAnd as for the \u201cNats haven\u2019t won anything yet\u201d crowd, check the standings. They secured a wild card. That\u2019s actually a real thing, one of two available playoff berths for teams that don\u2019t win their division.\n\nBesides that, the manner in which the Nationals won is cause for jubilee. No one figured October baseball was ahead after a four-game sweep by the New York Mets in May. Odds were that manager Dave Martinez wouldn\u2019t survive the regular season, let alone lead Washington to the postseason.\n\n\u201cEverybody in this clubhouse envisioned this exact thing right here,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe talked about it when we were 19-31, we talked about how we were going to laugh at everybody else outside of this clubhouse for everything that they said about us.\n\n\u201cAnd we are here now.\u201d\n\nNo matter what happens next, the feat called for celebration, not moderation. The Nationals realized as much and joyously obliged.\n\nParty on.Brooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
