You\u2019re bloated, you\u2019re craving sugar, you\u2019re easily offended and you spend hours in tears wishing you\u2019d never been born. You spend most of your time trying to think of the most effective way to kill yourself, or how you could die in a convenient, blameless accident. Your mind is totally black, and your insides are hollow.\n\nRight?\n\nOK, that\u2019s not true for everyone, but statistics suggest that one in 20 women feel so bad when their bodies are premenstrual that their thoughts are less about snacks and more about suicide.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling like your PMS is more severe than it should be, it might not be \u2018just you being dramatic\u2019 \u2013 you may have premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPMDD is a lot more severe than PMS, and is often defined as an endocrine (hormonal) disorder rather than a mental disorder. It\u2019s thought to be more prevalent in women who have pre-existing mental health struggles, such as severe depression or anxiety.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s important to differentiate between PMS and PMDD,\u2019 says psychotherapist Helena Lewis. \u2018PMDD is a recognised medical condition. No one knows what causes it, but changes in hormones are often to blame, and sometimes genetics play a part.\n\n\u2018PMDD is a more severe form of PMS, and carries more severe symptoms, which usually occur in the second half of the menstrual cycle.\n\n\u2018These symptoms include severe fatigue, mood changes, anxiety, depression, crying and emotional sensitivity, lack of focus, paranoia, memory loss, headaches, fainting and insomnia.\u2019\n\nKerry used to suffer horribly from PMDD until she found a solution to manage the hormonal attacks.\n\n\u2018I would have a week of feeling suicidal, anxious, depressed and generally crazy,\u2019 she told Metro.co.uk. \u2018Then when the hormones had subsided I\u2019d feel guilty for how I behaved. The cramps were total agony, I felt nauseous and would vomit, and just generally feel miserable.\u2019\n\nLou Pemberton also suffered similarly \u2013 PMDD is far more desperate than PMS.\n\nLou said: \u2018I felt trapped in a brain that made me feel like I should die. I constantly felt like something awful was about to happen. It was exhausting, terrifying and relentless. I also got flu-like symptoms, headaches and lethargy. For me the depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation are the worst symptoms.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Kerry and Lou tried a lot of different treatments to try to stem the horror before they found an option that worked, and their solutions were both radically different (of course, we all have different hormonal balances and reactions, so everyone will have different reactions to treatment).\n\n\u2018I have the mirena coil and so far I\u2019ve had no periods on it! No periods = no PMDD,\u2019 says Kerry. \u2018I was nervous before trying it, as all other hormonal medication I had tried made me feel worse \u2013 but so far I\u2019m really pleased with how the mirena is working.\u2019\n\nFor Lou, her solution was a lot more invasive after she was found to be treatment-resistant. She says: \u2018I am four months post-surgery from a total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (removal of my uterus and both ovaries). This was a very last resort treatment.\u2019\n\nLou found solace and support with fellow PMDD sufferers in online communities and says that \u2018social media has been a lifeline\u2019 for her: \u2018There is a wonderful, supportive PMDD community out there.\u2019\n\nLou suggests anybody who\u2019s concerned about PMDD to visit IAPMD. If you\u2019re suffering from PMDD symptoms, such as:\n\nFeeling suicidal\n\nFeeling hopeless\n\nHaving problems with your sleep\n\nBreast swelling and tenderness\n\nPain in your muscles and joints\n\n\u2026don\u2019t leave it any longer before you visit a health professional. There\u2019s a great, supportive community online at Vicious Cycle, and women with PMDD are sharing their tips and suggestions on Twitter. Mind has more information about the symptoms and causes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this absolutely sucks, but there are solutions and you\u2019re not alone.\n\nNeed support?
