About 6000 tonnes of food and fish scraps will be reused, equivalent to the waste produced by 4000 homes each year.\n\nThere will be a target to reduce plastic use by 50 per cent and non-drinking water will be recycled.\n\nMs Berejiklian said the markets were the second-most visited attraction in Sydney after the Opera House, and the biggest fish market in the southern hemisphere.\n\nConstruction was originally expected to start in the middle of this year but has been pushed back to late-2020. The new market is now not expected to open until late 2024 instead of 2023.\n\nThe existing market was established in 1966 and hosts 2.7 million visitors every year.\n\nMore than half of these are from metropolitan Sydney, another 22 per cent are domestic visitors and 20 per cent are overseas tourists.\n\nRelocating the markets will ensure they are able to keep operating during construction.\n\nIn 2016, the existing fish market had a wholesale and retail turnover of $323 million.\n\nOnce the new markets open, visitors are expected to more than double to about six million a year.\n\nIt will be a 24-hour per day, seven days a week operation like the existing fish market.\n\nThe markets are expected to employ 900 people and the development will generate 4000 construction jobs.\n\nThe development applications are on public exhibition until Wednesday, November 13 and there will be community information sessions held in October and November.
