However, the airline warned the tool was not foolproof, as the icon might not appear if a ticket was booked through a third party or if there was a last-minute change of aircraft.\n\nEven so, venture capitalist Rahat Ahmed sent a tweet on Tuesday thanking Japan Airlines for \"warning\" him about where children were sitting.\n\n\"This really ought to be mandatory across the board, \" he said, adding that Qatar Airways should \"take note\".\n\n\"I had three screaming babies next to me on my [New York to Doha] flight two weeks ago,\" he added.\n\nHis tweet attracted a number of responses, with some offering support for the \"awesome\" website booking feature.\n\nHowever, other Twitter users urged people to be tolerant.\n\n\"They are babies, as we all once were. We need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth breathers, droolers, farters, drunks, and perhaps a lot more things in life,\" said Twitter user G Sundar.\n\nAndrew Lim said: \"I used to feel and say exactly what you have just said - but after having my own son, I am very sympathetic to parents travelling with kids.\n\n\"If you're not happy with a screaming child in the cabin, then I am more than happy [for] you to try and reason with them.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @dequinix Thank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip.
