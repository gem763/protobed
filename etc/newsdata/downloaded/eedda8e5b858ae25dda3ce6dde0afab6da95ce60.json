Not once did anyone in the chamber use the phrase \u201csexual orientation.\u201d\n\nYet 55 years later, the Supreme Court has been asked to rule that the law does, in fact, cover sexual orientation in its Title VII ban on employment discrimination based on sex. The court has been asked to add \u201cgender identity\u201d as a protected class.\n\nThe three cases dealing with the Civil Rights Act are some of the biggest facing the justices in a term that is already shaping up to be momentous. Major decisions are expected on immigration, presidential powers and gun rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to affect so many millions of lives,\u201d said Gregory Antollino, the lawyer representing the estate of Donald Zarda, who was fired from his job as a skydiving instructor in 2010 after he revealed his homosexuality to a customer.\n\nThe customer later reported the interaction to Zarda\u2019s boss. Zarda said he was fired because of the incident, though the company, Altitude Express, denies the allegation.\n\nZarda died in a skydiving mishap in 2014, but his sister is fighting the case on behalf of his estate against his former employer.\n\nZarda won at the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which overturned its own precedent and decided that the Civil Rights Act did cover discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nAltitude Express appealed. It told the Supreme Court that the 2nd Circuit broke not only with its own previous rulings but also with decades of precedent in other appeals courts. The company said it\u2019s up to Congress to rewrite the law.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed.\n\nIn briefs filed last month, the Justice Department argued that Congress was clear on what it intended in discrimination law and that didn\u2019t include sexual orientation. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said Congress can, of course, rewrite the law to expand the categories of discrimination.\n\nCongress has considered a number of bills to do just that, and all of them have failed.\n\nMr. Francisco said businesses can offer their own guarantees but the court would be overstepping if it created the right on its own.\n\nGay rights groups counter that the Supreme Court expanded its understanding of sex in a 1989 case involving Ann Hopkins, who said she had been denied a promotion because she wasn\u2019t feminine enough and was told to wear makeup and act less aggressively.\n\nThe high court at the time said that amounted to sex discrimination because she was punished for flouting a female stereotype.\n\nZarda, in his case, said sexual orientation is another way of viewing stereotypes \u2014 the expectation that a man would be attracted to a woman rather than another man.\n\n\u201cJust as discrimination against Ann Hopkins based on the stereotype that women should be feminine and deferential was discrimination \u2018because of sex,\u2019 discrimination against Zarda because of the stereotype that men should be attracted only to women is discrimination \u2018because of sex,\u2019\u201d his attorneys argued to the justices.\n\nOn Oct. 8, the same day the Zarda case is scheduled, the justices are also scheduled to hear arguments in a dispute involving Gerald Bostock, who says Clayton County, Georgia, fired him from his job as a child welfare service coordinator after the court system learned he was homosexual and played in a gay sports league, Hotlanta Softball.\n\nThe court system says he was fired because he mismanaged funds.\n\nThe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Mr. Bostock\u2019s case, saying his discrimination claim couldn\u2019t stand because the Civil Rights Act doesn\u2019t cover sexual orientation.\n\nThe third case in the justices\u2019 combined docket deals with gender identity, which may not match a person\u2019s sex.\n\nThomas Rost, a devout Christian who owns a funeral home, fired a funeral director who maintained a male gender identity for six years at work and then started presenting as woman. Mr. Rost argued that was a problem for his business, which had a long-standing dress code for men and a different dress code for women. He said a reversal could be jarring for grieving families and that a funeral director\u2019s chief role is to blend into the background.\n\nThe 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, saying \u201csex\u201d as defined in the Civil Rights Act has come to mean gender identity.\n\nJohn Bursch, senior counsel for the religious liberty firm Alliance Defending Freedom, which is defending the funeral home, said the law is clear and that people should be able to rely on language that Congress wrote.\n\n\u201cTitle VII and other civil rights laws, like Title IX, are in place to protect equal opportunities for women; changing \u2018sex\u2019 to mean \u2018gender identity\u2019 undermines that,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nAbout half the states have laws that extend employment discrimination protections to sexual orientation or gender identity, but activists want a federal backstop to protect LGBTQ individuals in the other states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just again the decision which is something that we understand to be harmful \u2014 the decision to fire you \u2014 but it also includes harassment, so it\u2019s to say sexual orientation is not included really puts certain people out of protection,\u201d said Tristin Green, a law professor at the University of San Francisco.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
