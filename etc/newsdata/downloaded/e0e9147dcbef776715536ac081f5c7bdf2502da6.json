This guy [Patchell] doesn\u2019t think about the high tackle framework and we get penalised. Samu was reviewed for leading with his forearm. I think he may have lifted his arm to the Wales player\u2019s chest, but is that illegal? I am not sure I know the rules any more.\n\n\u201cAs a rugby player, a former player, I am embarrassed here. You have got to look after players, but not to the extreme where you are doing so just for the doctors and lawyers. I do not understand any more. The referees all seem spooked and everyone is worried, except the players. Then it affects everything else on the field.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Australia\u2019s flanker Michael Hooper (left) and centre Samu Kerevi listen to French referee Romain Poite after a high tackle. Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAsked to comment on the England centre Piers Francis escaping punishment after being cited for a high tackle during the opening minutes of the victory against the USA last week, Cheika said: \u201cI heard he got off. Maybe the lights going out [a few minutes before the end of the Wales match] is a bit of a symbol.\u201d\n\nKerevi said he was surprised to be reviewed and penalised for a technique he had used all his career. \u201cThe way the game is going I might as well join the Australian National Rugby League next season,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand it is a hard decision for the referees and I guess I have to change the way I run with the ball even though I have always done it.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\u201cIt is hard when it is slowed down to one-tenth of a second. It looks like I am going for his neck, but there is no malice in it. What do you do in that split second? I am coming at force and he is going backwards. So I can\u2019t move and might as well just stop? I guess I have to use my feet and not run straight any more.\u201d\n\nMotivated Samoa could punish Scotland for wading into tackle row | Andy Bull Read more\n\nPatchell, who came on as a first-half replacement for the concussed Dan Biggar and supplied 14 points with the boot, including his side\u2019s second drop goal, said he did not want to get involved in the debate. \u201cI tackled him and the referee made his decision. I am not here to say anything controversial. The game is the game and people make decisions. We are just out there to do our best.\u201d\n\nWales were on a high after their first win against a major southern hemisphere nation at the pool stage of a World Cup. They were outscored by three tries to two but the difference in their 29-25 victory was the two drop goals through Biggar, after just 36 seconds and Patchell, three minutes into the second half. It has been 35 Tests since they had last scored with a drop goal.\n\n\u201cIt was not a tactic we particularly had in mind for this game,\u201d Patchell said, \u201cbut it is something we work on in training. Everyone thinks tries win World Cups, but what counts is goal-kicking, being able to pick up points. You have to be ready for opportunities and we were. Dan hit his phenomenally well; mine was more scratchy but they all count and they both put vital points on the board for us in a big win.\u201d", "description": "Michael Cheika said that as a former player he was \u2018embarrassed\u2019 at the confusion the crackdown on high tackles is causing in the World Cup", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f517054556d0aaa5adb094528a223902ad9a4cbb/102_101_2094_1256/master/2094.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=01150a3b1b5226e8115e3ee33941a735", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
