The anger of young people who cannot afford even these shoeboxes has helped fuel violent protests.\n\nCarrie Lam, the territory\u2019s floundering chief executive, announced reforms last week. Paradoxically, they will mainly benefit tycoons with a stranglehold on the world\u2019s costliest residential market.\n\nA mid-range two-bedroom flat costs about $US3700 per sq ft ($5400 per sq ft) compared with $US2900 in New York and $US2300 in London, according to Deutsche Bank. The alternative, public housing, is scarce and can take Hong Kongers five years to find.\n\nOrdinary people are crammed into tower blocks. The elite live in lux pads on The Peak.\n\nMs Lam has promised more affordable homes by increasing land supply and easing loan requirements. The government plans to take private land, much of it used for farming, and build public housing on it. On the face of it, that would hurt developers who own most of the space. Instead, they should do nicely.\n\nThe reform depends on a piece of legislation called the Lands Resumption Ordinance to take control of private land for public use. That can take up to a decade.", "description": "For now it seems the best bet for an ordinary Hong Konger to get closer to affording a home is to invest in the city\u2019s despised developers.
