The CBO estimate that drug companies\u2019 revenues would be reduced by between $500 billion and $1 trillion over 10 years, leading to eight to 15 fewer new drugs coming to market over the next 10 years, out of about 300 total new drugs over that period.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, lower prices would increase use of drugs and improve people\u2019s health,\u201d the CBO wrote. \u201cIn the longer term, CBO estimates that the reduction in manufacturers\u2019 revenues from title I would result in lower spending on research and development and thus reduce the introduction of new drugs.\u201d\n\nThe resulting effect is not certain, the agency wrote. \u201cThe overall effect on the health of families in the United States that would stem from increased use of prescription drugs but decreased availability of new drugs is unclear,\u201d the CBO wrote.\n\nThe bill would also likely result in lower premiums for people with private insurance, the CBO wrote, though it said it is still working on a more complete analysis of the bill.\n\n\u201cThis initial analysis proves that H.R. 3 will effectively rein in the soaring cost of prescription drugs and level the playing field for American patients,\u201d three House Democratic chairmen, Reps.
