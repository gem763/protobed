The city\u2019s response has been weak for years.", "language": "en", "text": "A flier about K2 is seen in the Congress Heights neighborhood in Washington in November 2018. (Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post)\n\nAccording to a WTOP report last month on the prevalence of the illegal street drug K2 in the District, \u201cThere have been more than 3,000 K2 overdose cases through July, marking a 128 percent increase of the same stretch of time last year, when there were about 1,300 cases.\u201d\n\nReacting to the scourge of illegal street drugs, D.C. Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice Kevin Donahue and Marc Dalton, chief clinical officer at the city\u2019s Behavioral Health Department, issued a joint statement saying that Mayor Muriel E. Bowser\u2019s administration was working with law enforcement and a number of health providers \u201cto engage and educate the public on the effects of using dangerous substances.\u201d\n\nSince when? And to what effect?\n\nLet\u2019s revisit a bit of reporting I did seven years ago.\n\nIn May 2012, Kenneth Barnes, former head of the youth advocacy group Reaching Out to Others Together (ROOT), called me concerning reports of D.C. youths getting \u201cwigged out\u201d on a drug being sold openly in D.C. convenience stores and gas stations. The drug, Barnes said, was called K2 and was also being offered under the street names Kush and Abama. Parents had told him it was having a devastating effect on their kids. Look for it, he advised.\n\nSo, I did.\n\nWhile getting gas at the Exxon station in the 4500 block of Benning Road NE, I asked the clerk for Kush. She produced a shiny, colored plastic bag. Several ingredients were listed on the label on the back, along with the admonition: \u201cNot to be sold to children.\u201d I didn\u2019t recognize the ingredients, and I declined to buy the bag, which sold for $8.\n\nAt a gas station at Brentwood Road and V Street NE, there was no need to ask. Bags of Kush were on display inside the cashier\u2019s booth. The bag, the clerk said, cost $25. No sale.\n\nI later learned from a Washington bureau spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration that this so-called fake pot was being sold at retail outlets around the country and online under such brand names as K2, Kush, Fake Weed, Spice and Blaze. The products were plant material coated with chemicals claimed to mimic THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.\n\nBy that time, the DEA had taken emergency action to declare the chemicals used to make these products illegal, charging that the chemicals represent \u201can imminent threat to public health and safety.\u201d But that didn\u2019t mean the bags I saw were necessarily illegal, because the ingredients in the bags had not been tested. Moreover, the DEA said, manufacturers of synthetic drugs can easily change a product\u2019s name or switch ingredients to mask their intended purpose.\n\nSources of the convulsions, vomiting, disorientation and anxiety attacks being seen by parents and emergency room physicians in 2012 were no mystery \u2014 at least not in the District.\n\nYet the District dithered \u2014 that is until 2015, three years later, when overdoses from synthetic drugs spiked, sending dozens to area hospitals. Donahue also said that synthetics were part of the explanation for a jump in violent crime, noting, \u201cWe know that when we arrest people for violent crimes, almost 40 percent have synthetic drugs in their system.\u201d That bad news was a kick in city hall\u2019s butt.\n\nBowser (D) got emergency legislation passed, giving then-D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier authority to shut down any business found selling the drugs for a period of 96 hours while police investigated.\n\nBut the synthetic-drug market kept on truckin\u2019.\n\nIn September 2018, Bowser revealed that the spike in K2-linked overdoses was draining the city: \u201cOur emergency responders continue to respond to dozens of K2 overdoses every day.\u201d In that month alone, overdose cases exceeded 1,000, sending nearly 800 people to hospitals. Said Bowser: \u201cWe need to get these deadly drugs off our streets.\u201d\n\nThe District ended 2018 with 3,488 overdose cases and is well on the way to another record-breaking year.\n\nThat lethargic city response let synthetic-drug dealers gain a toehold in our communities. How lethargic? Emergency legislation to help law enforcement to crack down on suppliers of the drugs, introduced by the Office of the Attorney General and passed by the D.C. Council in 2016, was allowed to expire in 2017 without the council having made the action permanent. It wasn\u2019t until the September 2018 spike in overdoses that the D.C. Council, at Bowser\u2019s request, reinstated the legislation to help law enforcement officers crack down on K2 distributors and suppliers.\n\nAlarms sounded more than seven years ago went largely unanswered.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if you feel tempted to scoff at the joint statement by Deputy Mayor Donahue and the Behavioral Health Department\u2019s Dalton touting the Bowser administration\u2019s \u201ccommunity partnerships and public awareness campaigns\u201d about K2.\n\nPeople in affected communities know that stuff is out there. They are wondering what exactly their government is doing about it. Some began asking as long as seven years ago.\n\nRead more from Colbert King\u2019s archive.", "description": "What is D.C. actually doing about synthetic marijuana?", "authors": ["Colbert I.
