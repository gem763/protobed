They let us down massively, especially the kids.\u201d\n\nFull time carers Andrew, 40, and Danielle, 29, took every step to ensure the holiday was suitable - particularly as their five-year-old daughter Alanna-Rose suffers from cerebral palsy.\n\nAndrew said: \u201cTUI recommended the Atlantica Holiday Village Kos, in Greece as the perfect place for a family holiday.\n\n\"Despite reading some negative reviews online about the hygiene and cleanliness that sent alarm bells ringing, we were reassured by TUI that there were no issues to be concerned about.\n\n\"Within the first day of being there, our worst nightmares were confirmed.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe noticed straight away that there were ants crawling around both rooms, pubic hair in the bathrooms and blood stains on the bedsheets. It just wasn\u2019t up to standards at all.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"We were told that the TUI rep wouldn\u2019t be available until 9am and that we\u2019d have to wait to speak to someone.\"\n\nThey say ventually the hotel management offered to upgrade their room, but not for three days, and later that night the family claim they discovered bedbugs crawling all over the mattress and pillows.\n\n\u201cThe children were very unsettled and my wife stayed up all night in an arm chair,\" he added. \"We came on holiday to enjoy ourselves. Caring for our six kids, including one with a disability is hard, and going on holiday is a chance to relax which we were unable to do.\"\n\nThe following morning they were moved to a nearby 5-star hotel, the Atlantica Porto Bello Royal, but it did not have disability access or child-friendly facilities.\n\nThe family was also put in two rooms not on the ground floor, so Andrew had to lift his disabled daughter down two flights of stairs each day - but the worst surprise was they claim they had managed to bring bedbugs with them from the previous hotel.\n\nAndrew continued: \"They had got into our suitcases so we had to throw ours away that were expensive and TUI replaced them with cheap ones that weren\u2019t anything like our original matching cases.\n\n\"Our clothes were riddled with the bugs so had to be sent off for cleaning leaving us without a change of clothes for nearly two days. When we got our clothes back, a lot of the items had shrunk.\u201d\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nThe family continued to alert the TUI reps and they were offered a \u00a3250 holiday voucher, which Andrew said was unacceptable given the getaway cost \u00a34,428.\n\nHe contacted them again but claimed they said they could not find any issues and were not prepared to compensate them.\n\n\u201cWe have video evidence and a letter from the hotel manager apologising about the problems we were faced with, yet TUI still deny it all,\" Andrew added.\n\nWhile still in Greece, Andrew came across positive mentions of Bott and Co Solicitors on a Facebook TUI complaints page and contacted the firm asking for advice.\n\n\u201cWhen I spoke to Bott and Co, they told me to write everything down, take photos and video evidence and continue making complaints to the on-site TUI reps.\n\n\"They offered to take our case on and so when TUI continued to not take responsibility and refused to pay compensation I immediately got back in touch with them to make a claim.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Andrew Wylde and his wife Danielle, from\u00a0 Wallasey\nnear Liverpool, have sought help from a legal firm to get compensation for the disastrous holiday", "authors": ["Chris Flanagan", "Image", "Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20442664.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Andrew-Wylde_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
