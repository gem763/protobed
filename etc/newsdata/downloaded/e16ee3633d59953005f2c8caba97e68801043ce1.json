Tulsi Gabbard questioned her lack of foreign policy credentials. Andrew Yang said she\u2019s wrong about what\u2019s causing job losses. Kamala Harris ripped her for not supporting a gimmicky idea that Twitter should suspend President Trump's account.\n\nSeven of Warren\u2019s 11 Democratic rivals onstage Tuesday night in Ohio directly criticized her at least once. \u201cSometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up,\u201d said Beto O\u2019Rourke, criticizing her wealth tax.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation, and they\u2019re smart,\u201d said Yang. \u201cSaying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\u201d said Klobuchar. \u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nAnd so it went.\n\n-- Biden often faded into the background. No one onstage wanted to criticize Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign buckraking, fearing it would backfire and make them look like they were carrying water for Trump. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201d Relative to the previous debates, the former vice president was often an afterthought over the course of the three-hour telecast on CNN. That left Warren to feel the heat that comes with being considered a front-runner.\n\n-- Warren dominated the conversation. She talked the most, by far, with 23.1 minutes, compared to 16.6 minutes for Biden and just about 13 minutes each for Klobuchar, O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders and Buttigieg. Partly this is because Warren, once the Oklahoma state champion in high school debate, would never let the moderators cut her off and finished every point she wanted to make.\n\n-- In the short term, the pile-on helps Warren. It solidifies the impressions not just that she\u2019s ascendant, but that she\u2019s now the candidate to beat. She exuded confidence and looked strong by making no apologies for her positions. Her preparation showed, and she committed no errors. Warren looked big while the others, in some cases desperate to secure a spot in the next debate, collectively looked small. \u201cI understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren said.\n\n-- Warren\u2019s rivals seemed determined to undercut her brand as a teller of hard truths by repeatedly calling out her steadfast unwillingness to acknowledge that taxes will inevitably go up for the middle class under her Medicare-for-all plan. She declined to do so four separate times on Tuesday. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight: a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\" said Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this!\u201d\n\nWarren is sensitive to being lumped in with the Beltway set. She made a point to quickly attack \u201cWashington insiders\u201d and emphasized that she didn\u2019t get into politics until later in her career after studying and teaching bankruptcy law. Listen carefully, and you\u2019ll notice that she carefully avoids saying the H-word \u2013 Harvard \u2013 with its connotations of elitism. But she also showed she\u2019s no wilting lily: Responding to Buttigieg, she described his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d proposal as \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d Warren promised.\n\nSanders chimed in. \u201cI do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this, and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\n-- It should be said: This is more than just posturing and preening. Warren\u2019s perceived holier-than-thou ethos \u2013 derived from an apparent conviction that she\u2019s purer than other politicians \u2013 genuinely grates on several of her rivals and fellow senators. I\u2019ve heard multiple presidential candidates and their top advisers grumble about this privately over the past several months. Those exasperations bubbled over last night.\n\n\u201cWe have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren during the discussion about wealth. Referring to hedge funder Tom Steyer, making his first appearance in a debate, Klobuchar continued: \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nWarren, as much a pitchfork populist as anyone in the field, eggs on her crowds with soak-the-rich rhetoric. Supporters chant \u201ctwo cents\u201d at her rallies when she calls for a 2 percent annual tax on all assets worth more than $50 million. But last night, like the police chief in \u201cCasablanca,\u201d she pronounced herself \u201creally shocked\u201d \u2013 shocked! \u2013 \u201cat the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive\u201d when O\u2019Rourke said her wealth tax proposal pits people against each other. \u201cLook, I don't have a beef with billionaires,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\u201d\n\nAs other candidates expressed substantive disagreement with Warren\u2019s plan, she replied: \u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax? It\u2019s why is it that everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d\n\nBiden jumped in: \u201cNo one is supporting billionaires!\u201d\n\nCriticizing her on health care specifically, Buttigieg suggested that Warren might be too divisive as president at a time when America needs a leader who can heal. \u201cWe\u2019re competing to be president for the day after Trump,\u201d the boyish mayor noted. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there\u2019s a better way to deliver coverage for all?\u201d\n\n-- In the longer term, besides fears that she\u2019s too liberal to beat Trump, the debate highlighted two other reasons that Democratic pooh-bahs continue to express varying degrees of concerns about Warren\u2019s electability: her lack of national security experience and tangible achievements in Congress.\n\nWarren spoke less during the foreign policy round than any other part of the debate. \u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d she said during a discussion about Trump pulling out of Syria. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\u201d\n\nAs she geared up for a presidential run a few years ago, Warren maneuvered to secure a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2013 something she noted on Tuesday. But that pales in comparison to Biden, her main rival, who could talk about his extensive personal experience with Russia and Turkey. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton had also sat on Armed Services, served as secretary of state and visited more than 100 countries as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat. That didn\u2019t seem to do a bit of good for her in 2016. Unlike Clinton and Biden, though, Warren did not vote to go to war in Iraq.\n\nToward the end of the debate, Biden declared that he\u2019s the only one onstage who has accomplished anything significant legislatively. Warren responded that she helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before coming to the Senate. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it,\u201d Biden replied. Warren replied that she\u2019s \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Barack Obama for making sure the agency was included in the final version of Dodd-Frank. Biden smiled.\n\n-- Reflecting her status, even Yang swiped at Warren on three separate issues. He disagreed with her that bad trade policies are more to blame than automation for job losses in the heartland. He also said Warren\u2019s wealth tax idea has been tried \u2013 and then abandoned \u2013 in Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden. And he argued that breaking up big tech companies is overly simplistic.\n\nYang is obviously not a real threat to her, but Warren \u2013 eager to show she\u2019s a fighter \u2013 still took the time to say that her plan to expand Social Security benefits would do more to help people than Yang\u2019s plan to give every American a universal basic income with a $1,000-per-month check.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only time Warren sought to signal to Democratic voters that she\u2019s a counterpuncher who won\u2019t look the other way when Trump attacks. Warren turned Harris\u2019s Twitter attack around by hinting at how much money the California senator has taken from Silicon Valley and other corporate interests. \u201cI don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,\u201d Warren said.\n\n-- Warren easily defused a moderator\u2019s question about her age \u2013 she\u2019s a very energetic 70 \u2013 with a laugh line that hinted Trump might not be the GOP standard-bearer next year. \u201cWell, I say, I will out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,\u201d she said. (Biden, 76, also leaned into a question about his age: \u201cWith it comes wisdom.\u201d)\n\n-- Sanders may be fading in the polls, but he remains a force to be reckoned with on Warren\u2019s left flank. The 78-year-old pronounced himself healthy \u2013 \u201cI'm feeling great,\u201d he said \u2013 when asked about his recent heart attack. Sanders doesn\u2019t have much range, but he showed his sense of humor. When Cory Booker pointed out that Sanders favors legalizing marijuana, Sanders deadpanned: \u201cI'm not on it tonight.\u201d\n\nIn a blow to Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) plans to endorse Sanders for president and appear with him at a rally on Saturday in Queens. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), another member of the \u201cSquad,\u201d backed Sanders by sending out a news release shortly after the debate. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) reportedly plans to follow suit. \u201cSanders and Warren have been battling for the support of the women, holding individual meetings with them, co-sponsoring their legislation and wishing them well on social media,\u201d Sean Sullivan and Dave Weigel report. \u201cOn Tuesday, Sanders unveiled legislation with Omar to enact a universal school meals program.\u201d\n\n-- Another indicator that Biden is not a front-runner came in lackluster campaign finance filings released late last night: His campaign struggled to gain financial steam in the past three months \u2014 spending money at a faster clip and entering this month with a smaller campaign war chest than his leading competitors, Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy report. Biden\u2019s share of small-dollar donations, a signal of enthusiasm, was also significantly lower. The top fundraisers of the quarter were Sanders ($25.3 million); Warren ($24.7 million); Buttigieg ($19.2 million); Biden ($15.7 million); and Harris ($11.8 million). Sanders had $33.7 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter. Warren had $25.7 million; Buttigieg had $23.4 million; Harris had $10.5 million; and Biden had just $9 million. Among those five, Harris and Biden spent more money in the third quarter than they raised.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and two affiliated committees raised $85 million in the third quarter,\u201d Michelle and Anu note. \u201cAlong with the Republican National Committee, pro-Trump committees have $158 million on hand \u2026 Trump\u2019s main campaign committee saw a surge in legal fees in the third quarter, paying more than $2 million to various law firms. And Trump properties continued to benefit from the reelection effort, with Trump Victory spending $130,000 at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.\u201d\n\n-- Another takeaway from the debate: Democrats have flipped the script on national security, writes columnist Dana Milbank: \u201cA dozen years ago, President George W. Bush memorably attacked Democrats who wanted to pull out of Iraq: \u2018The party of FDR, the party of Harry Truman, has become the party of cut and run.\u2019 Now, a Republican president has recklessly pulled U.S. troops out of northern Syria, to calamitous effect, and it can truly be said: The party of Ronald Reagan has become the party of cut and run. \u2026 Democrats couldn\u2019t agree on much at Tuesday night\u2019s debate \u2026 But for 25 minutes during the second of three tedious hours, Democrats asserted themselves as the defenders of the American military and American security. Though a couple of them [Gabbard and Steyer] went their own ways, the others claimed the moral high ground once ceded to Republicans.\u201d\n\n-- What pundits are saying about who won and lost:\n\nThe Fix\u2019s Aaron Blake names Warren, Sanders, Klobuchar, Yang and America\u2019s Millennials as the winners. His losers are Biden, Steyer, Booker\u2019s attack on the moderator questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas work, as well as Biden\u2019s answer to that question, and the question Warren still won\u2019t answer: Whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would increase taxes for the middle class.\n\nNewsweek\u2019s Harriet Sinclair calls Warren the \u201cforce to be reckoned with,\u201d as Biden floundered and Buttigieg and Sanders impressed.\n\nUSA Today\u2019s Rebecca Morin and Savannah Behrmann call Klobuchar and Buttigieg the winners. They include the candidates who didn\u2019t qualify to get onstage on their list of losers: Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, John Delaney, Tim Ryan, Joe Sestak and Marianne Williamson.\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza picked Buttigieg, Yang, Klobuchar and Sanders as the winners. He said Warren, Biden, Harris and Steyer lost.\n\nDavid Axelrod, the CNN commentator and former chief strategist for Barack Obama, thinks Buttigieg \u201cbrought something more\u201d to the debate.\n\nVox called Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, opioid epidemic activists and universal basic income the winners, while Gabbard, Biden and free trade lost.\n\nBusiness Insider said Buttigieg had the strongest performance of the night, followed by Sanders, Klobuchar and Yang. Biden and O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t fare as well.\n\nArt Cullen, the editor of a small-town newspaper in Storm Lake, Iowa, told the Guardian that Sanders had the \u201chighlight of the night.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019s Doug Schoen called Warren the night\u2019s biggest winner. Sanders and Buttigieg were his \u201csurprise winners.\u201d Biden was his biggest loser, followed by the rest of the 2020 hopefuls.\n\n-- Looking ahead: Getting attention, which has always been a challenge for the lesser-known candidates, is only going to get harder because of the impeachment inquiry and Trump\u2019s knack for monopolizing the bully pulpit. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t the only problem the Democrats face in gaining a hearing from voters. The sheer size of the field inevitably has drawn more attention to the best-known candidates,\u201d writes chief correspondent Dan Balz. \u201cAn adviser to one of the candidates looking for a breakthrough emailed this assessment: \u2018The questions in the debate are disproportionately directed towards those who are already ahead in polls. Then the post-debate coverage is framed about what happened to and between those candidates. So it\u2019s largely a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u2019\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Moments after the debate ended, the Nationals won the pennant! Washington is going to the World Series! Jesse Dougherty and Sam Fortier report: \u201cAfter 86 years, after losing a baseball team for decades, then getting it back, then wondering if it would ever win the big game \u2014 or ever stop breaking hearts \u2014 the city had one more wait. It had to wait for a finish that seemed predetermined when the Washington Nationals stepped on the field Tuesday night. It had to wait because, in this sport, there\u2019s nothing more dangerous than assumption. The Nationals were going to the World Series. That felt clear once they scored seven runs in a first inning that left little doubt. It felt clear long before the Nationals beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 7-4, to complete a four-game sweep in a National League Championship Series that was one-sided from the start. It felt a little less clear after Patrick Corbin wilted, giving four runs back, but the bullpen held strong, navigated the last 12 outs and, with that, turned waiting into sheer delirium. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018I can\u2019t put this into words,\u2019 said Manager Dave Martinez, standing on a stage over second base, surrounded by ownership and the front office and the players that made this possible. Then Martinez reached for something his mother always told him. \u2018I\u2019ll say this: Often bumpy roads lead to beautiful places. And this is a beautiful place.\u2019 That triggered one of the biggest cheers of the night. The Nationals will soon play either the Houston Astros or the New York Yankees for the title. They\u2019ll arrive there having slipped to 19-31 in mid-May, surged through the final four months of a once-lost season and collected themselves for two dances with death in the earlier rounds.\u201d\n\n-- These Nats have proved everyone wrong, writes columnist Thomas Boswell: \u201cTwo points, both apparent in Game 4, should be made about these Nats \u2014 akin to noting that lightning cannot only electrocute you but also knock down trees on your head. \u2026 In their past 123 games, only the Yankees have scored more runs per game. The Nats\u2019 lineup, in their current state of perfect health, is one of the deepest and most multifaceted in the majors. \u2026 The other Nats weapon that has brought them to this city-delighting pennant is depth. \u2026 In the glee that now sweeps over Washington, don\u2019t bet the house on the Nats beating the 107-win Astros or 103-win Yankees. But it might be worth taking out a second mortgage on your gardening shed.\u201d\n\n-- Washington\u2019s baseball scars have healed, writes Barry Svrluga: \u201cThe heartache of previous Nationals teams is fresh in the minds of so many who crowded in Tuesday night. But the angst that goes back generations here is rooted not only in baseball failures but, worse, baseball\u2019s absence.\u201d\n\n-- The Nats didn\u2019t just sweep the Cardinals. They killed their identity, writes Isabelle Khurshudyan: \u201cThese Cardinals won their division with a commitment to fundamental, clean baseball \u2013 pitching well and committing the fewest errors of any team \u2013 but as they struggled at the plate, stymied by the Nationals\u2019 starting pitching, those frustration eroded the aspects of their game that had been considered team strengths.\u201d\n\n-- First baseman Ryan Zimmerman has been through it all with the Nats. For him, this is \u201csurreal,\u201d writes Roman Stubbs: \u201c\u2018A lot of people play for as long as I do and don\u2019t get a chance to do this,\u2019 he added. \u2018So I consider myself pretty lucky to still be able to do this. It definitely makes it a little sweeter.\u2019 What else was there to say? Zimmerman simply didn\u2019t have time Tuesday night to trace his path back to 2005, when he became the team\u2019s first draft pick after it moved to Washington, when he was called up right away and quickly became a franchise cornerstone.\u201d\n\n-- In the American League, the Astros lead 2-1 in the best-of-seven series after beating the Yankees 4-1. The earliest the Astros can clinch is Thursday, while the earliest the Yankees can clinch is Saturday. If neither does, a potential Game 7 to decide who the Nats will face in the World Series would happen on Sunday. The World Series starts on Oct. 22. While game times are yet to be announced, you should count on the first pitch to be sometime around 8 p.m. Eastern. (Scott Allen)\n\nTHE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:\n\n-- A top State Department official testified that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting this spring in which officials were determined to take Ukraine policy out of the traditional channels, putting Energy Secretary Rick Perry, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker in charge instead. Paul Kane, Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade report: \u201cGeorge Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, told House investigators he was instructed to \u2018lay low,\u2019 focus on the five other countries in his portfolio and defer to Volker, Sondland and Perry \u2014 who called themselves the \u2018three amigos\u2019 \u2014 on matters related to Ukraine, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) told reporters Tuesday. Kent took that as a sign \u2026 that having been critical of the plan he was being pushed aside \u2018because what he was saying was not welcome\u2019 at high levels of the government.\n\n\u201cMulvaney\u2019s meeting, which Kent told lawmakers took place on May 23, \u2026 was just days after the administration recalled Marie Yovanovitch from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \u2026 Administration officials informed the Ukrainians of their decision to shift authority for Ukraine policy in June, according to two people familiar with Kent\u2019s testimony. \u2018For some Americans from the embassy, that was news to them,\u2019 he added. ...\n\n\u201cInternal documents turned over to Congress by the State Department inspector general in early October showed that Kent suspected beginning in March that Yovanovitch had become the target of a \u2018classic disinformation operation\u2019 \u2014 and that he raised concerns to his superiors in the hope they would defend their own. Connolly said Kent testified that [Rudy] Giuliani relied on now-former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko for information damaging to Yovanovitch, which was also shared with John Solomon, a former columnist for the Hill newspaper. Lutsenko wanted to get Yovanovitch out of the way, Connolly recalled Kent as saying, and persuaded Giuliani with disinformation that she would also be a problem. Giuliani then persuaded Trump \u2026\n\n\u201cIn an interview Tuesday, Solomon denied he participated in a disinformation campaign. Giuliani and the Hill had alleged earlier this year that Yovanovitch provided a \u2018do not prosecute list\u2019 to Ukrainian officials to protect the Bidens and other allies. But Kent, according to the documents, told his colleagues that the list was phony, pointing to incorrect name spellings that longtime officials like Yovanovitch and himself would never have gotten wrong \u2026 \u2018One key sign of it being fake is that most of the names are misspelled in English \u2014 we would never spell most that way,\u2019 Kent, who is fluent in Russian and Ukrainian, said in one email to colleagues.\u201d\n\n-- Mulvaney has emerged as a key facilitator of the campaign to pressure Ukraine. Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey and Greg Jaffe go deeper: \u201cMulvaney declined requests for comment. Some of his defenders have said he knew very little about the details of the trio\u2019s efforts in Ukraine and was mainly orchestrating meetings for the president. \u2026 But current and former officials \u2026 said Mulvaney contributed substantially to the unfolding political crisis, both through his connection to key events related to the attempt to pressure Kiev and through his general approach to the chief of staff job, which was driven by a perceived reluctance to displease the president. \u2026 U.S. officials said Mulvaney met frequently with Sondland and that details of their discussions were kept from then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and other officials who were raising internal concerns about the hidden Ukraine agenda. \u2026\n\n\u201cThat largely off-the-books effort could not have proceeded, current and former administration officials said, without Mulvaney facilitating meetings, halting the flow of aid and circumventing the national security bureaucracy. \u2026 Sondland \u2018was talking to Mulvaney all the time,\u2019 said a former U.S. official familiar with their interactions. When confronted by Bolton or Hill, the official said, Sondland would rebuff them, saying he felt no obligation to coordinate with them because he had direct lines to Trump and Mulvaney. \u2026 U.S. officials said the friction between Mulvaney and Bolton led to a series of ruptures, including one on the day of the July 25 phone call. The White House has launched a formal internal review of the call and the circumstances around it, according to a senior administration official. \u2026 One of Mulvaney\u2019s top aides, Rob Blair, listened to the Trump-Zelensky call and briefed Mulvaney afterward, a White House official said.\u201d\n\n-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi is holding off on the vote to authorize Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry. From Politico: \u201cDemocratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be \u2018reassessed at some point.\u2019 The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. \u2026 \u2018We're not here to call bluffs. We're here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,\u2019 Pelosi added. \u2018This is not a game for us, this is deadly serious.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- A Ukrainian oligarch wanted by U.S. law enforcement has been helping Giuliani attack Biden, according to Time magazine: \u201cClose allies of the President have received key documents and information from [Dmitry Firtash], a Ukrainian oligarch wanted in the U.S. on corruption charges \u2026 [He] has spent the last five years in Vienna fighting extradition to the U.S. on bribery and racketeering charges. The U.S. Department of Justice said in 2017 he was among the \u2018upper echelon associates of Russian organized crime\u2019\u2014something Firtash vigorously denies, along with all charges against him. As part of his legal defense, Firtash\u2019s lawyers have gathered documents that make controversial allegations against former special counsel Robert Mueller and [Biden]. Firtash\u2019s lawyers have passed these documents and other information to associates of [Giuliani]. In his frequent appearances on cable news, Giuliani has presented some of these documents to the American public as evidence for his claims of wrongdoing by Mueller and Biden. \u2026 He did not mention that the affidavit was obtained by the Firtash legal team.\u201d\n\n-- Giuliani also privately urged Trump in 2017 to extradite a Turkish cleric living in exile in the United States, a top priority of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to multiple former administration officials familiar with the discussions. Turkey has demanded that the United States turn over Fethullah Gulen, a permanent U.S. resident who lives in Pennsylvania, to stand trial on charges of plotting a 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan. Gulen has denied involvement in the plot. Carol Leonnig, Ellen Nakashima, Josh Dawsey and Tom Hamburger report:\n\n\u201cThe former New York mayor brought up Gulen so frequently with Trump during visits to the White House that one former official described the subject as Giuliani\u2019s \u2018hobby horse.\u2019 He was so focused on the issue \u2014 \u2018it was all Gulen,\u2019 recalled a second former official \u2014 that White House aides worried that Giuliani was making the case on behalf of the Turkish government \u2026 Trump appeared receptive to the idea, pressing his advisers about Gulen\u2019s status \u2026 One former senior administration official recalled that Trump asked frequently about why Gulen couldn\u2019t be turned over to Turkey, referring to Erdogan as \u2018my friend.\u2019 Administration officials were overwhelmingly opposed to the idea and told the president that the move could violate the legal process and damage him politically.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, Giuliani unsuccessfully pressed then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to help on another matter important to Erdogan: helping stop the U.S. prosecution of a Turkish Iranian trader \u2026 Giuliani is not registered as a foreign lobbyist, as he would be required to do if he were being paid to lobby the U.S. government on a policy matter for a foreign interest. Giuliani told The Post \u2026 that he never represented Turkey and so he does not need to register as a foreign lobbyist. \u2026 In interviews in recent months, Giuliani has acknowledged working with clients in Romania, Brazil, Bahrain, Colombia and Ukraine. He has represented an Iranian dissident group, once so controversial it was placed on the State Department list of terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\n-- Giuliani and Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that they will not cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment probe or hand over documents sought by investigators.

(CNN)\n\n-- Giuliani's personal attorney, Jon Sale, will no longer represent him, per CNN.\n\n-- Former congressman Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) was subpoenaed over his interactions with Giuliani and his associates. From the Wall Street Journal: \u201cMr. Sessions is a longtime friend of Mr. Giuliani whose interactions with two of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, was detailed in the indictment unsealed last week. Matt Mackowiak, a spokesman for Mr. Sessions, said he is cooperating with the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office and would be \u2018providing documents to their office related to this matter over the next couple of weeks as requested.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The New Yorker details how Parnas, one of Giuliani\u2019s two indicted associates, became part of the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cone big family.\u201d \u201cIn June, 2015, Parnas\u2019s teen-age son, Aaron, called his father. \u2018Dad, I think one of your friends is running for President,\u2019 he joked. Aaron told me that, after Trump announced his candidacy, he called the Trump campaign to get passes to go with his father to a Trump rally in Florida. Parnas soon became a regular at Trump\u2019s rallies and other gatherings. \u2018I started donating. We started to help raise money,\u2019 he said. Gradually, Parnas said that he got to know other Trump donors, including Tommy Hicks, Jr., a private-equity investor in Texas who is close to Donald Trump, Jr. (Hicks has since become the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.) \u2018We became one big family,\u2019 Parnas said.\"\n\n-- Parnas was photographed attending George H.W. Bush\u2019s state funeral last year with Giuliani. Jeb Bush told BuzzFeed News that they didn\u2019t intend for Parnas to be there, suggesting that he was likely Giuliani\u2019s guest. \u201cDisappointing,\u201d the former Florida governor said.\n\nU.S. soldiers watch as Syrian Kurds demonstrate against Turkish threats near the Turkish border. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Erdogan rejected the Trump administration\u2019s offer to mediate a cease-fire between Turkish forces and Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria, brushing off threats of sanctions and vowing to press ahead with the military offensive. Erin Cunningham reports: \u201cErdogan told reporters late Tuesday that Turkey would \u2018never declare a cease-fire\u2019 and that he was unconcerned with U.S. sanctions targeting senior Turkish officials. \u2018They are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear,\u2019 he said of the United States and other Western nations, in remarks carried by the state-owned Anadolu news agency. He said he refused a U.S. proposal to broker a truce with Syrian Kurdish militants, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which had partnered with the United States to battle the Islamic State in Syria.\u201d\n\n-- Ashamed U.S. troops say Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria betrayed an ally. Dan Lamothe reports: \u201cWatching the rapid disintegration of security in Syria and the U.S. withdrawal, Marty Palmer recalled the night an Islamic State car bomb exploded near the Kurdish unit partnered with his Army Special Forces team. The attack in the summer of 2017 killed about eight Kurdish fighters, Palmer said. U.S. soldiers spent much of the night patching up about a dozen survivors, who were then whisked away to a nearby Kurdish medical facility. \u2026 Palmer, 32, is among several thousand U.S. troops and veterans who served in northern Syria and are witnessing the messy end of a years-long alliance with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. \u2026 \u2018It feels like we\u2019re abandoning our closest ally in the fight against ISIS, and we\u2019re abandoning them to a fate that is going to end very poorly for them,\u2019 said Palmer, who left active duty last year. To \u2018completely abandon\u2019 a force that has \u2018given thousands of lives for this conflict is really tough to watch.\u2019 ...\n\n\u201cAt least eight U.S. service members who served with Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq expressed disgust in interviews with The Washington Post about the rapid U.S. changes and the lack of a clear plan to prevent a crisis. Many of them, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, doubted that Turkish forces would have launched an assault into northern Syria if the White House had not said it would stand aside. \u2018I can\u2019t even look at the atrocities,\u2019 an Army officer who served in Syria last year said of videos posted online of Turkish-backed fighters executing Kurdish civilians. \u2018The ISIS mission is going to stop, ISIS is going to have a resurgence, and we\u2019re going to have to go back in five years and do it all again.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Fearing U.S. abandonment, the Kurds opened a back channel to the Syrian government and the Russians a year ago. From the AP: \u201c\u2018We warned the Kurds that the Americans will ditch them,\u2019 Russia\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, told Russia\u2019s Tass news agency on Monday. The switch in allegiances is a stark illustration of how American foes like Russia and Syria are working steadily to fill the vacuum left by [Trump\u2019s] retreat in the region. It also betrays the anxiety that U.S. allies across the globe now feel in the face of Trump\u2019s seemingly impulsive foreign policy decisions, which often come as a surprise to allies and critics alike. When Trump announced Oct. 6 that he was pulling American troops back from northeastern Syria, paving the way for an assault by Turkey, the Kurds knew exactly where to turn.\u201d\n\n-- The secretary general of the Kurdish Future Syria Party, Hevrin Khalaf, was murdered by armed men who ambushed her car. This has caused an outcry within Kurdish communities, who call it a war crime. Sarah Dadouch reports: \u201cKurdish leaders have accused an Islamist fighter of Khalaf\u2019s killing, identifying him as a member of the rebel group Ahrar al-Sharqiya. The group falls under the Syrian National Army, an umbrella group fighting alongside Turkish armed forces in northeastern Syria. A State Department spokesman, speaking on background, said Tuesday that reports of the killing of Khalaf and several captured SDF fighters were \u2018extremely troubling, reflecting the overall destabilization of northeast Syria since the commencement of hostilities.\u2019 \u2026 The killing is under investigation by Ahrar al-Sharqiya, said Ziad al-Khalaf, a member of the group. But Khalaf told The Washington Post that \u2018until now, there has been no proof\u2019 that a member of the group was responsible for the killing. Hassan al-Shami, a spokesman for the group, said Hevrin Khalaf was not a politician but an agent of U.S. intelligence, noting that her party was established on Washington\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\n-- Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law and senior campaign adviser, defended Trump\u2019s decision to abandon Kurdish allies in Syria by claiming that the \u201caverage American\u201d doesn\u2019t even know who they are. \u201cI think we should start with the fact that if you ask the average American out there, I think they would have to Google \u2018Who are the Kurds, and why is America even over there fighting this war?'\u201d Trump told Fox News host Shannon Bream.\n\n-- A Russian indicted by Mueller for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election was detained in Belarus for less than a week on the American charges, but she was released. Will Englund reports: \u201cThe suspect, Anna Bogacheva, immediately headed back to Russia with her husband and small child after being freed from detention in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, a Russian watchdog group said. Alexander Malkevich, head of the Moscow-based Foundation for National Values Protection, which monitors cases of Russian citizens who have been detained or arrested abroad, called it \u2018absolutely unacceptable\u2019 for Bogacheva to be held. It has been assumed from the beginning that none of the Russians indicted by Mueller would ever see the inside of an American courtroom, as long as they kept clear of the United States.\u201d\n\n-- Chinese authorities condemned the passage of a U.S. House bill that paves the way for economic sanctions against those who undermine Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. David Crawshaw and Shibani Mahtani report: \u201cThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, approved unanimously by the House Tuesday, requires the U.S. government to consider annually whether it should continue to treat Hong Kong as a separate trading entity from mainland China in response to political developments in the city. That special status has allowed Hong Kong to cement its role as an international financial center and exempts its goods and services from the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. \u2026 China voiced indignation at what it characterized as U.S. interference, with state news agency Xinhua branding the House\u2019s move \u2018arrogant and dangerous.\u2019 Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China would take strong measures to safeguard its interests. He said the bill demonstrated a \u2018naked double standard, which fully exposes the extreme hypocrisy of some people in the U.S. on the issues of human rights and democracy and their sinister intentions to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability and contain China\u2019s development.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Hong Kong demonstrators burned LeBron James\u2019s jersey in the streets after he accused Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey of being \u201cmisinformed\u201d when he expressed support for the pro-democracy movement. (Des Bieler)\n\n-- Chinese tech giant Huawei said it remains unbothered by a U.S.-led pressure campaign. Anna Fifield reports: The company \u201creported surprisingly strong sales in the first nine months of this year, defying expectations that American pressure would crimp its international business. The company, the world\u2019s largest maker of telecom network equipment, also said it has signed more than 60 commercial contracts to supply 5G technology to leading global carriers.\u201d\n\n-- British and European negotiators talked into the early morning to try to finalize a Brexit deal. Michael Birnbaum and William Booth report: \u201cBut even though policymakers on both sides seemed more optimistic than they had in months that a deal might be imminent, it was far from clear whether it will actually happen. Not only does [British Prime Minister Boris] Johnson first have to strike a bargain with the European Union \u2014 itself a difficult task \u2014 he then must sell it at home.\u201d\n\nWilderness staff for the Tongass National Forest walk through the Russell Fjord Wilderness in Yakutat, Alaska. (Paul A. Robbins/Forest Service)\n\nTHE OVERSHADOWED DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- The Trump administration is taking a big step to open up more than half of Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest to logging. Juliet Eilperin reports: \u201cTrump instructed federal officials to reverse long-standing limits on tree cutting at the request of Alaska\u2019s top elected officials, on the grounds that it will boost the local economy. But critics say that protections under the \u2018roadless rule,\u2019 finalized \u2026 in 2001, are critical to protecting the region\u2019s lucrative salmon fishery and tourism operations. The U.S. Forest Service said it would publish a draft environmental impact statement this week that, if enacted, would exempt the Tongass from the 2001 roadless rule. \u2026\n\n\"Tongass, which lies in southeast Alaska, is home to massive old-growth stands and provides habitat for a range of wildlife. Roughly 40 percent of wild salmon that swim along the West Coast spawn in the Tongass, generating a fishery that the Forest Service estimates is worth $986 million a year. The agency said in a statement that the Tongass \u2014 which ranks as the single largest holding in the federal forest system \u2014 covers 80 percent of the land along the 500-mile Southeast Alaska Panhandle. \u2018It is rich in natural resources and cultural heritage,\u2019 the statement said.\u201d\n\n-- The high-profile trial over who should pay for the opioid crisis begins today. Lenny Bernstein reports from Cleveland: \u201cThat effort begins Wednesday in U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster\u2019s courtroom on the 18th floor of the federal building here, where attorneys will start picking a jury for the landmark trial. Described as the most complex litigation ever, the trial will begin to sort out the welter of accusations over the crisis. While six drug companies are defendants in the case, jurors also may hear blame cast widely on doctors, government agencies and perhaps even drug users themselves. The jury\u2019s response will help decide who should bear the cost of one of this century\u2019s worst public health crises. \u2026 The plaintiffs need a unanimous verdict for any company to be held liable, and predicting a jury\u2019s reaction is difficult. More than 4 in 10 people know someone who has been addicted to prescription painkillers, and 1 in 5 knows someone who died of an overdose of prescription opioids, according to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. But those same polls show that 69 percent blame doctors for the prescription drug epidemic, 68 percent blame people who use the drugs, and 60 percent blame drug companies.\u201d\n\n-- Uber and Lyft are skipping a House Transportation and Infrastructure hearing scheduled for today aimed at examining their safety and labor practices. Transportation Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) said the panel will press ahead with legislation that could encompass safety and labor for transportation companies or ride-hailing companies without their cooperation, Faiz Siddiqui reports.\n\n-- Newly obtained Trump tax documents show major inconsistencies in how the president\u2019s businesses reported expenses, profits and occupancy figures for two Manhattan buildings, ProPublica reports: \u201cThe discrepancies made the buildings appear more profitable to the lender \u2014 and less profitable to the officials who set the buildings\u2019 property tax. For instance, Trump told the lender that he took in twice as much rent from one building as he reported to tax authorities during the same year, 2017. He also gave conflicting occupancy figures for one of his signature skyscrapers, located at 40 Wall Street. Lenders like to see a rising occupancy level as a sign of what they call \u2018leasing momentum.\u2019 Sure enough, the company told a lender that 40 Wall Street had been 58.9% leased on Dec. 31, 2012, and then rose to 95% a few years later. The company told tax officials the building was 81% rented as of Jan. 5, 2013.\u201d\n\n-- A federal appeals court revived a lawsuit claiming that Trump is illegally profiting from foreign and state government visitors at his Washington, D.C., hotel. Ann E. Marimow reports: \u201cThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to rehear the lawsuit, brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District, which was dismissed over the summer by a three-judge panel of the court. The brief order set oral arguments before a full panel of judges for Dec. 12 and essentially gives the novel lawsuit, which tests the anti-corruption emoluments provisions of the Constitution, a second chance.\u201d\n\n-- The Supreme Court seems hesitant to disrupt the work of a financial board overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s catastrophic economic problems. Robert Barnes reports: \u201cIf the hundreds of billions of dollars at stake were not enough, the justices were warned that upholding a constitutional challenge to the way the board\u2019s members were appointed could hold serious repercussions for other territories and enclaves where the federal government plays an outsized role in government affairs, such as the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\n-- A British family is currently in U.S. immigration custody after making what U.S. agents believe was a deliberate attempt to enter the country illegally from Canada. Nick Miroff reports: \u201cThe arrest and detention of the Connors family has received extensive coverage in the United States and Britain after their attorney described them as tourists who accidentally drove across the border and ended up jailed with their small children in what they called squalid conditions. \u2026 CBP officials disputed the family\u2019s version of events and said the Connors were spotted via video surveillance \u2018slowly and deliberately driving through a ditch onto Boundary Road in Lynden, Washington,\u2019 between parallel roadways on the U.S. and Canadian sides. The roads are not connected by cross streets, and the only legal way to traverse between the countries is through staffed border stations throughout the region. \u2026 The CBP statement said U.S. agents also determined that two of the family members had applied for travel authorization to visit the United States and were denied. A senior CBP official said the Connors applied for visa waivers last year, and it was not immediately clear why they were rejected.\u201d\n\n-- The black woman who was killed by a white officer in her home in Fort Worth heard noises outside and drew her legally owned gun, her nephew told authorities. Derek Hawkins reports: \u201cThe details in the affidavit add weight to earlier accounts of the shooting from family members and city officials who said Atatiana Jefferson was trying to protect herself and the 8-year-old boy from what she thought was an intruder when she was killed early Saturday. \u2026 According to the affidavit, Jefferson\u2019s nephew told a forensic interviewer that he and his aunt were playing video games in a back bedroom when Jefferson \u2018heard noises coming from outside\u2019 and \u2018took her handgun from her purse.\u2019 The boy told the interviewer that Jefferson \u2018raised her handgun, pointed it toward the window\u2019 and \u2018was shot and fell to the ground,\u2019 according to the affidavit. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump's trade adviser has consistently cited a trade scholar who doesn't exist:\n\nPeter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser and chief cheerleader of his China policy, has apparently been quoting staunch China hawk \"Ron Vara\" in his books for years.
