That information has been added to the article.\u201d\n\nAfter the clarification was discussed on the president's favourite television show, Fox & Friends, Mr Trump tweeted: \"Just Out: \u2018Kavanaugh accuser doesn\u2019t recall incident\u2019.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nHe added: \u201cDO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!\u201d\n\nMr Trump also tweeted a quote from Fox & Friends contributor Dan Bongino: \"What\u2019s happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace. This guy is not a good man, he is a great man. He has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him, a disgrace!\"\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the media as well as Democrat politicians, who have used the latest revelations to call for Mr Kavanaugh to be impeached.\n\nAnother tweet read: \"The New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.\u201d @foxandfriends The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems.\"", "description": "Donald Trump has tweeted an angry defence of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh over fresh sexual misconduct allegations as pressure to impeach the controversial judge continues to build.At the weekend the New York Times published new accusations suggesting that Mr Kavanaugh exposed himself to a woman", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l7.zmosSpB5UdCQUSV8CkQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/d5f01ce9edc05ce98aced39772294788", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
