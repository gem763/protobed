But global trade tensions and burgeoning U.S. production have offset their actions, keeping prices closer to $60 a barrel.\n\nEconomists have notched down estimates for economic growth this year for the world\u2019s biggest exporter of petroleum. A median forecast of 10 economists predicts Saudi Arabia\u2019s gross domestic product will grow 1.4% this year, down from an estimate of 2.2% at the end of last year, according to FactSet. The International Monetary Fund is slightly more bullish: In July it said economic output would grow 1.9%.\n\n\u201cYou get quite a big drag from the oil sector over the course of this year,\u201d said William Jackson, an economist at London-based Capital Economics, which sees Saudi growth this year of just 0.3%.\n\nThe health of the Saudi economy has become more important to global investors and government officials in recent years, as the kingdom opens its financial system to the outside world. A downturn could threaten its own investment activity, which has included big stakes in companies like Tesla Inc., and temper investors\u2019 interest in putting money into Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi stock market has fallen more than 14% since the beginning of May, despite its inclusion that month into the MSCI Inc. emerging market index, which spurred billions of dollars of passive investment from international investors.\n\nAnalysts warn that a proposed initial public offering\u2014revived last month\u2014of Aramco, the national oil company, will be worth less if oil prices remain at current levels and the kingdom keeps tapping the company for cash to balance its budget. The company paid the kingdom a $20 billion special dividend in the first half of this year despite a 12% fall in profits because of low prices. Bankers last week pitched to arrange an Aramco listing.\n\nSaudi Arabia \u201ccame out aggressively with the IPO news in a period of stock-market and oil-price weakness,\u201d said Richard Fullarton, founder and chief investment officer at London\u2019s Matilda Capital Management. \u201cMaybe they need the cash.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of Aramco and the Saudi Finance Ministry didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSaudi Finance Minister Mohammed al Jadaan, in a half-year budget-performance report last month, said the government was managing a balancing act: It is trying to implement projects to boost economic growth and improve the standard of living for Saudi citizens, he said, while at the same time executing fiscal reforms and seeking to control growing public debt.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What implications could a weakened Saudi economy have for the rest of the Middle East? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe government in July introduced 24-hour business hours to boost spending and encourage shops to hire more; Saudi investment bank NCB Capital estimated the move would raise GDP by up to 0.3 percentage point this year.\n\nThe Saudi sovereign-wealth fund also plans multibillion-dollar real-estate projects to boost the tourism, retail and entertainment industries.\n\nIn a sign the kingdom\u2019s rulers are unhappy with the pace of economic change, the country\u2019s energy minister Khalid al-Falih lost his oversight of non-oil industries last week. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman holds Mr. Falih responsible for the lack of economic advancement, according to Saudi officials.\n\nA sluggish Saudi economy could suppress the appetite among foreign investors for plowing money into the big projects envisioned by Prince Mohammed. Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-price problems come just as the country is launching a series of economic reforms that would have been fiscally painful even in flush times.\n\nA move to get more Saudis working has resulted in large-scale deportations of foreign workers, damping consumer spending. Sales transactions and cash withdrawals across the kingdom fell in June, compared with a year earlier, and non-oil exports have trended down in almost every month this year, according to Saudi central-bank data.\n\nEfforts to jump-start the non-oil economy haven\u2019t yet taken flight. Foreign-direct investment increased in the past six quarters, hitting $1.25 billion in the first three months of this year. But it remains reliant on the oil sector and low compared with the peak of $10.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Unemployment is 12.5%.\n\nOil prices remain the biggest catalyst for Saudi growth. The government forecasts it will run a deficit this year of 131 billion Saudi riyals ($35 billion), or roughly 4.2% of GDP. To balance the budget, Saudi Arabia requires oil prices at $85 per barrel, the IMF estimates.\n\nThe Saudis made a concerted push to nudge oil prices up in 2018, targeting $80 a barrel and largely succeeding.\n\nWhat does the road to an IPO look like for the world\u2019s most profitable company? After repeated delays, Saudi Aramco has revived plans for what would be the biggest-ever IPO.\n\nTheir efforts hit a wall this year, however, as the trade war between the U.S. and China has lowered estimates of oil demand in Asia, Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest market. American oil production has also surged, keeping the world amply supplied and weighing prices down.\n\nThe lower prices aren\u2019t going away, according to the International Energy Agency and banks, which have slashed oil-price estimates. Morgan Stanley recently predicted $60-a-barrel Brent crude and $55-a-barrel West Texas Intermediate crude, two benchmark prices for oil, through the end of 2020.\n\nTo meet spending needs, the Saudi government plans to raise another $30 billion in public debt this year. Even with that extra money, the kingdom doesn\u2019t have enough cash to cover its expenditures, economists say.\n\nAnalysts say Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel the kingdom leads, might also have to consider further production cuts to maintain oil prices at the current levels near $60. Those could be agreed on at an OPEC meeting in December.\n\nEnergy Journal In Your Inbox Get a Monday morning jolt of insight and analysis on the global energy business, with our Energy Journal newsletter.
