The medical examiner hired to oversee the autopsy of Jeffrey Epstein by the convicted pedophile\u2019s family went on Fox News today and declared that the autopsy \u201cpoints toward\u201d a homicide rather than a suicide. How or if this changes the course of the ongoing investigation is a mystery. (NY Post)\n\nNew York City\u2019s former chief medical examiner insisted Wednesday that Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death was a homicide. Dr. Michael Baden was hired by the pedophile\u2019s family to observe his autopsy after he was found hanged in his federal lockup in Manhattan in August. \u201cI think that the evidence points toward homicide rather than suicide,\u201d Baden insisted on Fox News Wednesday.\n\nWhat Dr. Baden is talking about isn\u2019t some new revelation from the examination that hadn\u2019t been made public before. He\u2019s referring to the same things we were debating here when the initial autopsy results were released.\n\nHe\u2019s specifically referencing the broken bone(s) in the throat that are \u201cunusual\u201d in suicides performed via hanging. His hyoid bone was broken, a symptom most medical experts seem to agree is more common in strangulations than hangings. But there has only been one study of such suicides published that I\u2019ve seen. It did indicate that the hyoid bone only broke in six percent of 264 cases studied. But the point is that it did happen sometimes, if rarely, so I suppose they couldn\u2019t rule it out.\n\nThe coroner did eventually rule the case a suicide. But it\u2019s worth noting that even then, attorneys for Epstein\u2019s family objected to the findings and called them into question.\n\nWill Baden\u2019s opinions reopen that aspect of the investigation? It\u2019s hard to see how. There certainly have been plenty of cases where the findings of an autopsy were later revised by the coroner if significant new evidence came to light. But this is the same autopsy report we had back in the middle of August and Baden doesn\u2019t appear to be claiming that any new information has just become available.\n\nThe medical examiner is definitely right about one aspect of the case. He went on to say point out the \u201ctotal breakdown in security\u201d at the jail and the cascading series of errors that led to Epstein being able to take his own life (assuming he didn\u2019t have help). Nearly everything about the case looked suspicious and there were clearly a lot of powerful people who would likely sleep better at night knowing that Epstein wasn\u2019t flapping his gums to law enforcement or the media.\n\nBut I said \u201cnearly everything\u201d for a reason. We can\u2019t entirely discount the fact that he\u2019d already attempted to take his own life once or that he was facing what would amount to a life sentence behind bars after living a life of decadent luxury. In that context, suicide is certainly a conceivable path for him to have taken. Frankly, as much as the entire affair stinks to high heaven, I\u2019ll be surprised indeed if the investigation is reopened as a possible homicide based on nothing more than Baden\u2019s interview.", "description": "Curiouser and curiouser", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/epstein.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
