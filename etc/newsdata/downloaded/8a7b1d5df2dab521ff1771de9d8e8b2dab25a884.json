The good news is that the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s FY19 National Business Insights Report on the state of innovation in Australia shows that companies have elevated innovation to be part of their business as usual operations.\n\nSource: Commonwealth Bank National Business Insights Report FY19\n\nThe report found 88% of respondent companies claim to innovate, with 58% of overall survey participants satisfying the definition of innovation as outlined by the OECD\u2019s Oslo Manual \u2013 introducing a new or significant improvement in one or more of the following areas of a business: product, process, marketing or organisational. The other 30% were classified as \u201cimprovers\u201d rather than innovators.\n\nThis innovation is happening across the country, the report shows, highlighting \u201cinnovation is well understood and occurring more widely regardless of a company\u2019s size, industry, or location.\u201d\n\nCritically, this survey of 2747 businesses and 2422 staff shows across Australia \u201cthere are strong links between innovation, adaptability, and an organisation\u2019s sustainability,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the customer\n\nThe results show the standout factor driving a company\u2019s need to implement change is \u201cto meet evolving customer expectations and to improve the customer experience,\u201d the report said.\n\nThis report again reinforces that while \u201ctechnology is an enabler,\u201d it\u2019s also critical to \u201censure that the organisation\u2019s workforce has the skills and capabilities needed to continue to adapt as customer expectations evolve and as the business environment changes.\u201d\n\nThree factors stand out as the keys to success in taking advantage of market opportunities and meeting these increased customer expectations:\n\nA skilled and agile workforce,\n\nTechnology solutions, and\n\nAccess to financial resources\n\nSource: Commonwealth Bank National Business Insights Report FY19\n\nSoft Skills Matter\n\nWith the customer as the key driver behind the need for innovation, the survey again highlights that the human element is critical in the process.\n\n\u201cDespite a clear desire among Australian businesses to develop technology skills, the research finds there is equal, if not more, emphasis on the so-called soft skills,\u201d said Adam Bennett, Commonwealth Bank Group Executive Business and Private Banking.\n\nHe highlighted that \u201cbusinesses want employees who are flexible and adaptable, who communicate well and can manage and lead others\u201d.\n\nSource: Commonwealth Bank Business Insights Report FY19\n\nIt\u2019s this relationship between technology and a company\u2019s workforce where they can \u201cgain and maintain a competitive advantage,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThe virtuous circle of adaptability and innovation\n\nWhat the survey shows is that there is a virtuous circle of innovation driving adaptability, noting that \u201ccompanies that have the inherent capability to adjust to new conditions are the ones more likely to be busy implementing change,\u201d the report said.\n\nThis appears to be because of the self-reinforcement of success.\n\n\u201cDecision-makers from businesses that are implementing meaningful change \u2013 and employees who consider their organisation to be innovative \u2013 are more likely to be confident in their ability to adapt to the external factors in their environment than their peers in companies that aren\u2019t actively innovating,\u201d according to the survey.\n\nCrucially the survey showed that \u201cthe difference among employees is particularly striking\u201d.\n\nSource: Commonwealth Bank National Business Insights Report FY19\n\nSuccess breeds success, or at least a confidence that innovation breeds adaptability, and any further challenges can be faced.\n\nAnd that will go a long way to making Australian business more resilient, competent, and sustainable over the long term.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nThis article has been prepared by Business Insider solely for information purposes based on the results of an online survey conducted between September and October 2018 by ACA Research on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank and is not to be construed as a solicitation, an offer or a recommendation by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
