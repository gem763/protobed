The Army and the U.S. Defense Department separately posted, then quickly deleted, at least one photo of the battery preparing for duty. Some websites preserved the photo.\n\nTHAAD antagonized the Russian government, just like Aegis Ashore has done. Russia \"can\u2019t understand what tasks the Aegis Ashore system will accomplish in the missile defense area,\u201d Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said in late April 2019.\n\nThe Pentagon and NATO repeatedly tried to explain their reasoning for deploying THAAD. \u201cAt the request of NATO, the secretary of defense will deploy a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to Romania this summer in support of NATO ballistic-missile defense,\u201d U.S. European Command announced in early April 2019.\n\n\u201cThe THAAD, from the 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, will integrate into the existing NATO BMD architecture during a limited period of scheduled maintenance and updates on the Aegis Ashore missile-defense system in Romania this summer.\u201d\n\nAs of early 2019 the Army had acquired around 200 THAAD rockets for its seven batteries and roughly 40 launchers. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency on its website describes THAAD as a \u201cland-based element capable of shooting down a ballistic missile both inside and just outside the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Moscow hates THAAD and Aegis Ashore.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NewpaBRC8lKrQAdYrTXlCQ--~B/aD05NjY7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/85f4a81ea9b9ae83bb7671276ce6dc20", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
