I\u2019d just piloted a now-19-year-old Ellie through peril after peril, amassing a grisly body count along the way. Few of those kills were clean. Many were desperate knife flurries, death by a thousand sinew-snapping stabs and cuts. Human enemies mourned their fallen comrades, bellowing their names at me with bestial fury while charging to the same pointy end. And yet, after I finished the demo, I walked into a nearby bathroom, stared into a mirror, and asked myself \u201cDid it work? Do I care?\u201d\n\nDeveloper Naughty Dog wants The Last of Us Part II to be a lot of things. Where the first game was about the overriding, sometimes destructive power of love, Part II is about hate. Last time, we played as Joel \u2014 a more nuanced bearded man than your typical action game star, but an archetype nonetheless.\n\nThis time, players will control Ellie, a young queer woman trying to find life in Last of Us\u2019 zombie-infested world. It\u2019s a story about being a teenage girl and becoming an adult, navigating a strained relationship with your father figure, and falling in love. But ultimately, as director Neil Druckmann said at a preview event in Los Angeles earlier this week, The Last of Us Part II is a revenge story. \u201cHow far would you go?\u201d he asked ominously during a presentation before the hands-on session.\n\nThe demo\u2019s first section took place early in the game, with Ellie and new character Dina \u2014 who shared the most natural-looking kiss in video game history during a 2018 E3 trailer \u2014 riding on horseback through a snowy landscape, doing patrol duty for their Jackson, Wyoming settlement. For the first 15 minutes or so, the two chatted (and bantered) back and forth about plans, people they knew, and relationships while checking in at a station and scavenging some abandoned houses. The tone was light and flirty.\n\nAt one point, Dina asked Ellie what she was planning to do that night, clearly angling for something. Ellie said she was thinking about watching a movie with Joel, which drew a surprised reaction from Dina. \u201cOh,\u201d Dina said. \u201cAre you two... cool?\u201d Joel did, after all, basically sacrifice humanity\u2019s future to save Ellie at the end of the first The Last of Us \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear whether Ellie knows that or not.\n\nThe tension quickly dissipated, however, when Dina asked what kinds of movies Ellie and Joel liked to watch. Joel is big into cheesy martial arts flicks, it turns out. But even this conversation was tinged with melancholy, as Ellie pondered if, somewhere out there among all the desolation, there were people still making movies.\n\nAny time I shoved my shiv into Infected, metal scraped against wet flesh and bone while the Infected flailed and wailed, their death gurgles so piercing that it was as though they were screaming in my ear.\n\nEllie and Dina came across a hollowed-out mess of a moose corpse that had doubtless been peeled to the bone by zombie-like creatures, called Infected. From there, the level transitioned into a pretty traditional Infected-centric level that wouldn\u2019t have felt out of place in the first game.\n\nAs Ellie, I had to stealth through a series of increasingly Infected-overrun offices and warehouses en route to an abandoned supermarket. This section served largely as a tutorial, reinforcing the first game\u2019s conventional wisdom that while you can open fire on Infected and pray that you emerge from the ensuing fray with all the meat still attached to your clavicles, it\u2019s a better idea not to.\n\nInstead, I crouched down and used the \u201clisten\u201d ability, which makes a return from the first game, to \u201chear\u201d (read: see an outline of) where enemies were. Then I had Ellie creep up on fast, relatively weak Runner Infected and blind but much more powerful Clicker Infected and quietly and methodically carve their necks open. Dina, when she could do so without alerting other Infected, followed suit.\n\nThe Last of Us Part II is a sound design tour de force. Clickers screeched, wailed, and of course, clicked with characteristic inhumanity, lacing even sure shot stealth kills with dread right up until the moment I finally did the deed. But it\u2019s not like successfully ending the walking embodiments of \u201cWhat if athlete\u2019s foot, but too much\u201d felt much better.\n\nAny time I shoved my shiv into Infected, metal scraped against wet flesh and bone while the Infected flailed and wailed, their death gurgles so piercing that it was as though they were screaming in my ear. I was never sure if other Infected had heard, and this kind of tension is baked into every element of the sound design. Breaking the glass on a vending machine to grab a candy bar led to a shattering sound that nearly made me jump out of my seat, even when I was certain there were no surviving Injected to hear the sound and come running.\n\nThe section also introduced me to the game\u2019s expanded crafting and customisation systems. This time around, you can find supplements \u2014 pills, basically \u2014 and spend them on ability upgrades spread across three trees. Abilities included increased listen mode movement speed, increased throw distance, increased health kit usage speed, and, toward the top of the stealth-focused tree, craftable silencers that could be applied to guns and improved. Part II also contains an expanded crafting system that lets you create various attachments and improvements for guns.\n\nLike in the first game, you collect scrap to purchase these upgrades. As someone who prefers to strike from a distance, I saved up until I could snap a scope on my hunting rifle to give me more distance from my Infected targets. The scope, of course, was no insurance against Infected near me hearing the sound, but it gave me a small, if false, sense of safety. While there\u2019s nothing like headshotting one Infected from two hundred feet away, I am resolutely not a fan of being eaten by the three other nearby Infected that react to gunshot sounds like Pavlov\u2019s dog does to bells\n\nWith their supermarket cleanup complete, Ellie and Dina decided they were done with patrolling for the day and wanted to head back to the settlement. Unfortunately, a blinding snowstorm picked up, and the two got separated. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, Dina emerged and led Ellie into what appeared to be an abandoned daycare.\n\nBefore long, the two discovered that it was once the secret hideaway of their now-deceased friend Eugene, who\u2019d had the good fortune to die of old age \u2014 a rarity in The Last of Us\u2019 world. As I explored and read through notes and other belongings Eugene had left behind, Ellie and Dina learned more and more about a man they only thought they\u2019d known.\n\nHalley Gross, Part II\u2019s head writer alongside Druckmann, said the goal of the game\u2019s worldbuilding is to enrich characters and, in some cases, fully explore characters the player never actually meets. \u201cYou never meet this man, but by the end of this level, you\u2019ve learned he\u2019s got a grow house, he likes to smoke some weed, he used to be a Firefly [the series\u2019 militia], was involved in some terrorism, left his family, and left his kid to go pursue this mission he thought was bigger and greater than the individual,\u201d said Gross.\n\nThe level ended with Ellie and Dina discovering Eugene\u2019s secret underground weed den, left to fall into disrepair after his passing. It was a surprising moment, sprinkled with levity. I came across a gas mask (crucial for avoiding infection) with a bong attached. \u201cGod,\u201d quipped Dina, \u201cEugene was so smart.\u201d\n\nAfter rummaging around, Ellie and Dina settled on a couch and \u2014 with nothing better to do while waiting for the storm to pass \u2014 lit up. Dina then worked up the courage to ask Ellie a question. \u201cSo, on a scale of one to ten, how would you rate our kiss last night?\u201d she asked. While asking this question, Dina bit her lip and moved her eyes furtively. It was far and away some of the most detailed digital acting I\u2019ve seen. When Ellie mumbled out a non-response, Dina continued: \u201cI\u2019d give it a six. A solid six.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re infuriating,\u201d said Ellie.\n\n\u201cHave you met you?\u201d replied Dina.\n\nThen they made out, of course. The first portion of the demo closed on this moment, a heartwarming end to a series of harrowing scares. The whole scene left a smile on my face. It was a rare moment of authentic warmth in a big-budget action game. It was easy to imagine from there how this relationship, with its believable tender moments, might play out. The two would banter, bicker, fight, and make up. It\u2019d become a running (though playful) joke between their friends. They\u2019d explore together. Watch movies together. Maybe they\u2019d stay together. Maybe they\u2019d break up and go their separate ways. Young love is fickle like that.\n\nBut The Last of Us Part II is a revenge story. It is about hate, not young love.\n\nNaughty Dog will not say if Dina dies at this point, though the studio has heavily implied it multiple times by depicting intimate scenes between Ellie and Dina followed immediately by a solo Ellie performing shockingly realistic acts of violence against humans from opposing factions.\n\nIn the game\u2019s first trailer, she said she\u2019d \u201cKill every last one of them,\u201d and in subsequent trailers as well as the demo I played, she seems to be making good on her promise. She is taking revenge for something. Do other humans kill Dina? Or is this Naughty Dog setting up an almost too-obvious bait and switch? For now, it\u2019s impossible to say.\n\nWhat I do know is that the second half of the demo found Ellie all alone. It took place later in the game. Ellie was in the overgrown, eternally-overcast ruins of Seattle, Washington, surrounded by derelict salons, tattoo parlors, and coffee shops. She was looking for Tommy, a returning character from the first The Last of Us, who was seemingly in conflict with a local faction, the xenophobic Washington Liberation Front.\n\nSeattle, perhaps even more so than the Wyoming location in the first portion of the demo, was dense with detail. Stores were littered with notes and other items. I could explore at my leisure, though I was always ultimately be funneled down a set, linear path. It wasn\u2019t long before I ran into members of the WLF, who were not at all happy to see me. Fortunately, I had new stealth options on my side.\n\nThe area was overrun with tall grass, in which I could go prone and crawl around. This rendered me almost invisible, allowing me to set up some gnarly, knife-y ambushes. But I could never just chill and take in the scenery. Most of the WLF members had dogs, and these dogs could track my scent. Usefully, going into listen mode allowed me to see that scent, so I could at least know what I was dealing with.\n\nI struggled to acclimate to this system, dying often. Initially, I tried to play this section like I would any other stealth game, figuring out patrols and then closing in for the kill. As I moved in, however, a dog would sniff me out or start barking. This would alert or attract enemies, and I\u2019d charge them in a panic, plunging my knife into any available body part. It was chaos.\n\nEach slash produced rivulets of blood and stringy hunks of flesh. Dogs barked. Both Ellie and my opponents grunted and yelped in anguish and exertion. I\u2019d win one of these desperate melees, drop into the grass, and apply a health kit. Ellie would groan, as though bringing herself back from the brink took a little more out of her each time. It was not pretty.\n\nWhen another enemy discovered a body I\u2019d left behind, they\u2019d shout in alarm and, more pointedly, grief. Usually, they\u2019d say the person\u2019s name. They all have names. In one of the most surprising moments of the demo, I quietly dispatched somebody while their dog was distracted. Upon noticing, the dog proceeded to nudge their person\u2019s arm, then pull on it, and then mournfully whimper.\n\nLater, I half-jokingly asked Gross what Naughty Dog has against dogs, given that I\u2019d just killed a bunch of them and given even more traumatic separation anxiety. She replied that the goal throughout all of this violence and strife is to humanise the people Ellie is facing off against. It\u2019s part of an effort to explore real-world issues like tribalism.\n\n\u201cI think when you have any sort of close-knit tribe, you have this danger of becoming tribal. This idea of the other,\u201d said Gross. \u201cSo we have these enemies where, you see one of the dogs clawing for its owner, or one of the fallen soldiers calls out his name. So much of what we\u2019re trying to do is create empathy for the other. We make this enemy, and then how do we make you feel for them? So much of this game is about developing an understanding of where other people are coming from... We want to put you in a situation where you have to make hard choices. You didn\u2019t have to kill any of them. None of them are mandatory to get through that level. So it\u2019s a question of \u2018How much is it worth\u2019 to kill them?\u201d\n\nI probably would\u2019ve been better off if I hadn\u2019t killed any of them \u2014 at least, from a resource management perspective. But these people and animals were obstacles on my path toward standard video game goals, and before long, I was treating them like any other video game enemies. I killed some and spared others. When I killed enemies and nobody noticed, it felt good. Great, even.\n\nThe level had a fantastic sense of forward motion to it, with Ellie scrambling through houses and leaping out half-rotten window frames, all as part of a larger downhill slope toward Tommy\u2019s location. Enemies were everywhere, and their dogs would find me if I stayed in one spot for too long. I had to be stealthy, but I also had to move. I felt tense and alarmed when I got spotted, though not out of any feeling for my enemies. Rather, I was in danger and didn\u2019t want to have to open the menu and choose the \u201creload checkpoint\u201d option again if I screwed up so badly that the run was unsalvageable.\n\n\u201cSo much of what we\u2019re trying to do is create empathy for the other. We make this enemy, and then how do we make you feel for them?\u201d\n\nI won a bow and arrow from a thrilling close-range fight against a special Infected. The bow is a silent, long-range, exceedingly deadly weapon. I laid in the grass and picked my shots. Nobody could touch me. Heck, most of them couldn\u2019t even find me. I don\u2019t remember any of their names.\n\nI began to wonder if enemies shouting names and dogs mourning their owners was less a humanising element and more a tool of only briefly effective emotional manipulation. In response to this, Gross said that there\u2019ll be more nuance to depictions of enemy characters in the final game.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is create a holistic approach to empathy,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s the NPCs that you meet very briefly, but even in that moment we\u2019re naming them. We\u2019re also occasionally giving them human conversations. As you traverse by, you\u2019ll overhear their conversations about things back home, their fuller lives. But also we have these enemies that Ellie is hunting, and as with all characters in the Last of Us universe, we\u2019re trying to make everybody as multifaceted as possible and everybody as diverse as possible so that we can try and create challenges for empathy and then reach out toward them.\u201d\n\nThe demo ended with Ellie dropping down into another portion of the level, only for some mysterious pair of meaty dad arms to pull her aside. At first, she struggled. Then she turned around and asked \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d It was Joel. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let you do this on your own,\u201d he replied. That was it. Demo over.\n\nThat was when I stood up, walked over to the nearby bathroom, and took stock of everything I\u2019d experienced. I was still full of adrenaline from all the close shaves, melee throwdowns, and dog murders. The Last of Us Part II is shaping up to be a very exciting stealth-action game. Its mechanical additions to the first game\u2019s formula are smart; the studio isn\u2019t trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather to further emphasise what made the original stand out and give players a little more wiggle room in terms of choice.\n\nBut those brief moments of Ellie and Dina awkwardly fumbling through the early goings of a relationship were what stuck with me more than the usual Video Game Emotions of tension, anxiety, anger, relief, exhilaration, and \u201cOh no, I killed a dog.\u201d I wanted to see more of that story, more of love finding a way to survive and even thrive in a dying world.\n\nBut this is a story about revenge, and so, I found it hard not to hearken back to Heather Alexandra\u2019s 2018 piece about how queer characters in video games rarely get to be happy and how their backstories often centre around tragically deceased partners. The Last of Us, it should be noted, has already done this on a couple occasions, with multiple characters. This includes Ellie in the first game\u2019s prequel Left Behind DLC.\n\nAgain, I do not know if Dina will die. Maybe she\u2019ll instead betray Ellie and everybody else at the Wyoming settlement. Or maybe Ellie will go on a revenge quest for reasons entirely unrelated to Dina. But it seems clear that Ellie ends up very unhappy. Gross said that there\u2019s a very deliberate purpose to putting Ellie into this kind of narrative. She believes that Part II is not just another post-apocalyptic story about characters being sad, another member of a very crowded club. It\u2019s a story that she hopes will reflect on the real world in unique ways and give people something positive to hang onto during times of strife, xenophobia, and hate.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to be feeling is resilience,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do live in a difficult time, and Ellie lives in an incredibly difficult time, an incredibly hostile world. I want to feel inspired. I want to feel inspired by a character that is going to get knocked down and is going to pick herself back up, because that\u2019s what I want to see. That\u2019s what I want to feel when I go out the door every day to engage with how hard things can be right now.\u201d\n\nI asked her if she feels like the game is deliberately political in that respect. She replied that it depends on your definition of the word. \u201cWe are 100 per cent trying to engage with the world around us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur games are super diverse, and that\u2019s because we want to reflect the world we see around us. Our games are about strong people dealing with hard times. So many of our characters are about like \u2018Is it OK to be strong and to be vulnerable? Is it OK to make mistakes and pick yourself back up?\u2019 So if that\u2019s defined as political, then fuck yeah we\u2019re political.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Gross\u2019 goal is to do right by Ellie\u2019s character and write somebody that she and others can relate to through good times and bad.\n\n\u201cI love seeing more women protagonists,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful. I think we\u2019re doing ourselves a disservice when those female protagonists are impervious, when they\u2019re too strong. I can\u2019t relate to them. What Ellie did [in the first The Last of Us] is show me this vulnerable, scrappy girl who\u2019s having an incredibly hard life, but who\u2019s incredibly great \u2014 who picks herself back up and is willing to go the extra mile for people that she loves. To me, that\u2019s the humanity of her. That\u2019s what makes her so relatable. And that is something I really wanted to honour.\u201d", "description": "I emerged from my three-hour The Last of Us Part II demo session tense and anxious, a coiled fire hose of pent-up adrenaline.
