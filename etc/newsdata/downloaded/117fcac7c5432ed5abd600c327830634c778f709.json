In secret, Ocasek had tweaked the exhaust pipe of his family\u2019s Mercury Comet so as to at least make a louder vroom, if not a faster ride. When his dad eventually found out, \u201cthere was hell to pay,\u201d as Jon Pareles wrote. Of his then-livid father, Ocasek said, \u201cHe never understood why I did it.\u201d\n\nThat story feels oddly resonant after Ocasek\u2019s death at age 70-something (he long hid his birth date from the press). The grin-worthy yet heady music of The Cars partook of consummately American traditions while also rewiring them. Ocasek was a rule breaker, but a meticulous one. He understood rock and roll as a machine, but he also knew it as a vessel for passion, mystery, and defiance.\n\nFormed in 1976 after Ocasek had organized and abandoned a series of less successful projects, the Boston-based Cars arrived with a miracle of a debut single, \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d which is still its signature song. \u201cI guess you\u2019re just what I needed\u2014I needed someone to feed,\u201d went Ocasek\u2019s lyrics, subtly defacing a familiar love-song line with an ambivalent sneer, a move he\u2019d repeat over the course of his career. The song\u2019s guitar splatters conjured lineage stretching from Chuck Berry. But the cool blue tones of the keyboard and the precise ticktock of the percussion also signaled a new era. Or rather a \u201cnew wave,\u201d the term that would describe both the disaffected punk of the \u201970s and the synth-powered dance tracks of the \u201980s, thanks to the bridge The Cars built.\n\nThe band served up an impressive number of hugely agreeable sing-alongs from the time of its 1978 debut album, The Cars, through 1987\u2019s Door to Door, after which the band didn\u2019t play together again for more than two decades. Its catalog includes the clap-and-moan fun of \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl,\u201d the peppy MTV staples \u201cShake It Up\u201d and \u201cYou Might Think,\u201d and the reverberating, poignant ballad \u201cDrive.\u201d These are songs that everyone knows; they\u2019re also templates for vast swaths of modern pop and rock. The New Pornographers owe Ocasek a debt, but so does Taylor Swift. It\u2019s fitting that Ocasek served as an album producer for Weezer and No Doubt, two acts that were already zipping down a road that his band had paved.\n\nIt\u2019s also notable that Ocasek produced works by the band Suicide, whose diffident and experimental noise-pop never had a chance of approaching The Cars\u2019 success. For all his mainstream appeal, Ocasek had an ear for the weird. His lyrics pushed pop\u2019s frivolous clich\u00e9s into droll jokes, as heard in the plodding, hypnotic title mantra of 1978\u2019s \u201cGood Times Roll.\u201d He made no apologies for splicing electronic elements into guitar rock, even at a time when doing so was often written off as suspect and cheesy. In this, he presaged a lot about how popular music would move in the decades after his band\u2019s debut. His fascination with then-novel sounds began in high school, when he\u2019d spend hours in his family\u2019s basement fiddling with keyboards.", "description": "The late singer Ric Ocasek conquered the mainstream with oddball energy and an understanding of how machines can amp emotions.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19073761985295/facebook.jpg?1568659803", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
