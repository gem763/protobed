It\u2019s part of what makes the Herriman complex, called Soleil Lofts, so attractive to Sonnen.\n\nIn Herriman, Sonnen sees an opportunity to prove that a virtual power plant (VPP) could solve major energy problems in the US. A VPP is made up of connected solar roofs and batteries so that renewable energy can power the entire complex if the grid loses power.\n\nThe first residents of the Soleil Lofts will move in this September, and the Wasatch Group, which is the company building the lofts, says the last building will be completed in 2020. Units in each of the 600 new rental apartments will be outfitted with Sonnen products to power the VPP.\n\nWhen complete, the community will be the largest operating VPP formed by residential batteries in the US, according to Rocky Mountain Power, the regional utilities, the Wasatch Group, and Sonnen. The completed project will have a planned 12.6MWh of solar energy storage.\n\nSonnen pioneered VPPs in Germany and the UK, and now it wants to conquer the US\n\nSonnen, which was founded almost 10 years ago in rural Germany, is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of residential energy storage systems. Sonnen says it has installed over 40,000 batteries worldwide, mostly in Europe. The company, which was acquired by oil and gas giant Shell in March, pioneered VPPs in Germany and the UK. Now, Sonnen wants to conquer the US. It even has a production site in Atlanta to help with that task.\n\nThe US is \u201ca relatively young market for our products, still in its infancy,\u201d Sonnen CEO Christoph Ostermann tells The Verge. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a very large market.\u201d In any case, it is a market with energy problems.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Utah where millions of people have experienced blackouts recently. In most other states, the situation is no better \u2014 or even worse. The energy infrastructure is aging all over the country. In California, energy company PG&E has been responsible for more than 1,500 fires since 2014, so it has announced and implemented rolling blackouts to avoid sparking more fires.\n\npower generation is responsible for a third of all US carbon dioxide emissions\n\nThe National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) warns of unprecedented mega blackouts, triggered by severe earthquakes as well as physical or cyberattacks on the energy grid, that could cut off entire regions from electricity for months. On top of this, power generation is responsible for a third of all US carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nSonnen wants to help solve these problems, but its success depends on utilities, regulators, and consumers playing their part, experts say. This isn\u2019t a given in the US, where President Donald Trump is withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, an international agreement that\u2019s attempting to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cAs one of the world\u2019s largest producers of carbon dioxide, the US need solutions to promote renewable energies,\u201d Ostermann says. \u201cPolitically, this may be controversial, but there are more and more consumers who recognize this.\u201d Ostermann is convinced that his company\u2019s technology can help relieve the strain on the outdated power grid in many states while protecting consumers from power outages at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe hurricane or the cyberattack comes, the grid is gone, but you can continue to light and operate your house.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that difficult to explain why solar systems with batteries might benefit the consumers who can afford them. \u201cThe hurricane or the cyberattack comes, the grid is gone, but you can continue to light and operate your house because you have a storage system and a solar system,\u201d says Ostermann.\n\nBut the advantage for the entire grid isn\u2019t as obvious. When utilities have planned how efficient the power plants and lines they build must be, they planned around the system\u2019s peak, says Ryan Hledik, a principal at research consultancy Brattle Group who focuses on distributed energy technologies. The US power grid is built around the hours in the year when people use the most electricity. In most places, those are hot summer afternoons when everyone turns on the air conditioning. But that infrastructure is aging, and energy consumption is reaching record highs.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, renewable energy can add more stress to the already creaky grid. Without a battery to store the energy, solar energy goes directly to the grid whether it\u2019s needed or not. The sun also shines, of course, when the grid doesn\u2019t need much energy. That means that some solar farms are told to shut down to prevent clean electricity from clogging the grid. This, too, can lead to power outages.\n\nrenewable energy can add more stress to the already creaky grid\n\nThis is why batteries and VPPs are part of Sonnen\u2019s plan. Tesla also has a VPP program with Green Mountain Power in Vermont. (Tesla\u2019s solar energy projects stem from the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016.) Solar battery installation is also on the rise in California where almost 10,000 home battery systems were in place last year, which is 25 times more than in 2016, according to BloombergNEF. BloombergNEF has predicted that battery installations will rise \u201cexponentially\u201d worldwide.\n\nA VPP is easier for a utility to deal with than individual solar panels because a VPP operates as one asset rather than several individual homes. If too much energy is produced from the solar panels, it can simply be stored in residents\u2019 batteries. And because the energy from the solar panels is stored locally, the utilities can draw from batteries during peak hours, Ostermann explains.\n\nThe software associated with the batteries can also alleviate strain on the grid. For instance, the batteries can be set so that devices such as electric vehicles or air conditioners do not necessarily draw power at peak times, but before or after them. \u201cWe shave off peak consumption and supply, if you will,\u201d Ostermann says. Ultimately, that may mean saving utility companies money: they won\u2019t have to build new power lines because the peaks of usage are less drastic.\n\n\u201cWe shave off peak consumption and supply.\u201d\n\nThis sounds like a convincing plan to Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPersonally, I thought this was always the model that Tesla with SolarCity was going at,\u201d he tells The Verge. \u201cBut they just haven\u2019t been particularly good in executing it.\u201d\n\nThere are some hurdles to Sonnen\u2019s plan, though. Specifically, it might not make money. Whether you can make money with a VPP has to do with regulations, Ceder says. Every state \u2014 even every utility \u2014 can draw up its own regulations, and a provider like Sonnen can\u2019t avoid them if it wants to set up a VPP. \u201cIf the utility says, \u2018No, the network belongs to us, and we are not up for your idea,\u2019 then it won\u2019t work,\u201d says Ostermann.\n\nThere\u2019s an even bigger economic hurdle: solar incentives. In many parts of the US, customers who add solar to the grid through solar panels can then consume just as much from the grid without paying a cent, says Hledik. Consumers, therefore, have no financial incentive to actually use the electricity they generate. They can feed superfluous clean power into the grid during the day and draw the same amount of conventional power out of it at night.\n\n\u201cThe customer is basically using the grid as a virtual battery, and probably saving more money from the production of their solar facility than it\u2019s really worth,\u201d Hledik says. \u201cThat policy has prevented solar plus storage from becoming very common for residential customers in the US. They don\u2019t need to consume the energy from the solar panel on site in order to avoid the full retail rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSonnen could probably for the next ten years just pick off the environments in which it is easiest to operate.\u201d\n\nOstermann points out that regulators in some states are already moving away from the net metering policy. Hledik agrees this is a trend, so the economic incentives against having a battery may not continue.\n\nIn the meantime, Sonnen is pursuing a strategy that worked for its project in Utah: finding utilities, housing companies, and consumers that want to give the technology a try. The best candidates for Sonnen projects are ones who are interested in both the financial benefits and protecting the climate. Ceder believes that strategy may be successful for Sonnen, in part, because batteries are far less expensive than most customers think.\n\nBut it\u2019s also true that the US has lots of regional and local grid operators \u2014 it is, after all, a very large market. \u201cSonnen could probably for the next ten years just pick off the environments in which it is easiest to operate,\u201d Ceder says. That means the Soleil Lofts in Utah might be just the beginning.", "description": "Sonnen, the German energy storage company, wants to ensure that one thing the future residents of an apartment complex in Herriman, Utah, never experience is a blackout.
