They\u2019re pretty far along. So somehow, things weren\u2019t necessarily managed as well as they could have been if they ended up in hot water again like that.\u2019\n\nEpisodes of The Mandalorian will be dropping weekly following its launch, with the space opera\u2019s finale coinciding with the release of The Rise of Skywalker in December.\n\nThere\u2019s also much more Star Wars content heading our way, including Ewan McGregor\u2019s return as Obi-Wan Kenobi, with the actor admitting today that the new spin-off has been a \u2018long time coming.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mandalorian launches on Disney+ on 12 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
