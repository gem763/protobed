At the inquest Milat refused to answer any questions and even blamed the girls\u2019 parents with the Newcastle Herald quoting him as saying: \u201cI could ask how could they let a 14-year-old [Amanda Robinson] run around to midnight?\u201d\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Was Ivan Milat Responsible For The Disappearances Of 3 Newcastle Women?\n\nWhen Milat\u2019s terminal illness was first made public, many hoped he\u2019d make a deathbed confession for not only the 7 backpacker murders but perhaps also clear up some unsolved cases like the one above, but despite NSW Police\u2019s best efforts, he refused.\n\nThe Nine Network aired footage from NSW Police interviews on A Current Affair last night, with several outlets including the Sydney Morning Herald claiming that police attempted to get a confession out of him on eight separate occasions, attempting to appeal to his conscience by showing video of the victims\u2019 families.\n\nYou can see the Milat Tapes right here:\n\n9 News quoted him as saying:\n\nYou could bore me eyes out with a blowtorch and I can\u2019t help ya. I still could not tell you one word about any of them missing people in that Newcastle area. Whether you believe me or not, that\u2019s up to youse. I don\u2019t count, immaterial to me. But I know in my heart, in front of God or wherever, I\u2019m quite, quite happy when I say this.\n\n\n\nThe publication also reports that police spoke of \u201cgrief for the victims\u201d and Milat responded with \u201cI don\u2019t care, that\u2019s it\u201d, with 9 News adding that police told him he could reach out at any time, to which he responded: \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath waiting for me to call.\u201d\n\nIn other (more welcome news), NSW Corrective Services Minister Anthony Roberts today told 2GB radio: \u201cHell will freeze over before Corrections NSW pays a cent for this man\u2019s funeral.\u201d", "description": "Ivan Milat took his secrets to the grave, but not for the efforts of NSW Police, who interviewed him eight times attempting to get a confession.", "authors": ["Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/milat-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
