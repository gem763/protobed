Finley alleges that in April 2018 the actress\u2019s mother dragged him through a first-floor window by his arm and physically assaulted him as the actress attempted to pin him down.\n\n\u201cOnce Mr. Finley was lying helpless on the ground outside, Isabel, who is substantially larger than Mr. Finley, got on top of Mr. Finley\u2019s body and began punching him,\u201d the lawsuit reportedly states. \u201cWhile beating Mr. Finley, Isabel screamed, \u2018You\u2019re not so much of a man now,\u2019 which was a clear and denigrating reference to Mr. Finley\u2019s gender identity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Finley\u2019s lawyer, Tasha AlyssaHill, said \u201cin response to Mr. Finley\u2019s complaints, Rosario would respond to Mr. Finley, \u2018You\u2019re a grown woman.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAs his attorney, we have reached out numerous times to the Dawson family attorney seeking to resolve this before having to file suit,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\n\u201cHe just wants to get some sort of compensation, so he can get back on track with his life so he can put this incident behind him,\u201d she added.\n\nDawson, the girlfriend of 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), has not commented on the accusations.", "description": "Rosario Dawson and several members of her family have reportedly been accused of a\u00a0transphobic assault against a handyman.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/RosarioDawsonsuit1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
