(Oct. 25) AP, AP\n\nIn a Saturday morning series of Twitter posts, President Donald Trump criticized three major California elected officials and slammed the city of San Francisco as being in \"horrible shape.\"\n\nTrump's singling out of the California politicians continues his feud with the progressive-leaning state.\n\nFirst, Trump went after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district, which sits entirely within the city of San Francisco, criticizing the Speaker for working on an impeachment inquiry into the Trump administration's withholding of military aid to Ukraine unless the Ukrainian government opened investigations into Trump's political adversaries.\n\nAccording to Trump, Pelosi's district \"is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary & environmental orders, causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars - and all she works on is impeachment...\"\n\nTrump said, \"We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away,\" adding that the conditions in the city were \"severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply,\" appearing to refer to his previous critiques of the city's homeless population.\n\nMore: 'I'm the team': Trump dismisses need for impeachment response team\n\nMore: Trump critic gets 1st pitch at Series game Trump to attend\n\n\"Pelosi must work on this mess and turn her District around!\" Trump warned.\n\nTrump's criticism of Pelosi's district echoed previous criticisms of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings' district in Baltimore, Maryland, which Trump had called a \"disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\"\n\nI can\u2019t believe that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary & environmental orders, causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars - and all she works on is Impeachment..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2019\n\nTrump went on to attack Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who represents a Los-Angeles-area district and is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, asserting that Schiff \"made up\" what Trump said on his call with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\"The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it,\" Trump wrote. \"Even Shifty Schiff got caught cheating when he made up what I said on the call!\"\n\nSchiff has told CNN he was \"mocking\" the president's tone on the call, though some of his descriptions of the call during a Sept. 26 hearing did depart from the summary of the call.\n\nMore: Trump administration releases details of call with Ukrainian President Zelensky amid impeachment inquiry\n\nTrump also went after Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who is also a Democratic presidential candidate, calling her \"badly failing\" and criticizing her for not going to attend a forum in South Carolina on criminal justice reform at Benedict College, a historically black college.\n\nHarris had pulled out of the forum, citing media reports that students in the college were not allowed to attend the speech. She slammed Trump as having \"celebrated mass incarceration\" and \"pushed the death penalty for innocent Black children.\"\n\nTrump disagreed.\n\nThe criminal justice bill \"and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!\" he wrote.\n\nBadly failing presidential candidate @KamalaHarris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I recieved a major award, at the same event, for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation, which will.. \u2014 Donald J.
