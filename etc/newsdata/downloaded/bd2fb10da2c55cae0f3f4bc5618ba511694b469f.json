But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden.\n\nMany of the states on the Super Tuesday map \u2014 which includes a handful of Southern and Border states \u2014 play to his strengths among African-American voters and more moderate Democrats.\n\nThe Super Tuesday focus also serves as an insurance policy against Warren, in particular, since her appeal to white, liberal voters could mean strong finishes in places like Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 which, in turn, could propel her momentum through Nevada and South Carolina and into the next stage of the primary.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden, left and Sen.

Phillip) More\n\nCentral to the Biden campaign\u2019s theory is the belief that, after the Feb. 29 primary in South Carolina, the now-sprawling Democratic field would be narrowed to just two candidates. And one of them \u2014 Biden \u2014 would be far better positioned to amass delegates on a primary date that offers a windfall of roughly 1,300.\n\nBy contrast, in the four early-state contests only 155 delegates are up for grabs.\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, this will likely be a two-person race coming out of South Carolina, and whomever emerges from Super Tuesday with a significant delegate lead will be extremely difficult to catch,\u201d a senior Biden official said.\n\nUnder Democratic delegate selection rules, some congressional districts are allocated more delegates than others. For months, the campaign has zeroed in on the most delegate-rich congressional districts in Super Tuesday states like Texas, North Carolina, California and Alabama and attempted to assembleslates of supporters specific to those districts.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s majority-minority 1st District is one of them. In that congressional district \u2014 where eight delegates are on the line, rather than the four or five that most other districts offer \u2014 Biden was recently endorsed by Congressman G.K. Butterfield.\n\nOver the next two weeks, Biden\u2019s campaign will expand on those efforts by building out a formal Super Tuesday apparatus, adding to its dedicated staffing in the Philadelphia headquarters and hiring state directors in some of the biggest and most delegate-rich states. Biden has traveled to nine Super Tuesday states in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe endorsement slates we\u2019ve rolled out are proof of the time and energy we\u2019ve put into these states to date,\u201d said Biden deputy campaign manager of states, Pete Kavanaugh. \u201cNo one has been able to release remotely close to what we have.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to detail the resources it\u2019s committing to Super Tuesday. Nor would they acknowledge that their strategy is geared toward Warren, who has surpassed Sen. Bernie Sanders in some recent national and state polls.\n\nBut they repeatedly stressed that Biden\u2019s advantage is with a \u201cbroad, diverse\u201d coalition of voters. Implicit is the idea that the South could be tough terrain for Warren and her liberal brand of politics.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is ramping up its investment in Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March.
