Sapporo\u2019s notorious entertainment district is a block of 20-storey tower blocks, neon from the pavement up: restaurants, bars, gaming parlours, cinemas, salons and love hotels, heaving with off-duty office workers and, for this weekend at least, several thousand English and Australian rugby fans. The England team are staying 10 blocks away, just the other side of the river. They haven\u2019t been any further than the local cafe. \u201cWe just tend to find the best coffee shops if we can,\u201d said Owen Farrell. But the atmosphere was crackling in their hotel.\n\nEngland are, as Eddie Jones says, about to go over the top of a rollercoaster they have been riding ever since they arrived at their training camp 10 weeks or so ago. You could see it in Jones, who seemed so wired he was almost vibrating with nervous energy, and hear it in George Ford:\u201cIt\u2019s through the roof, we can\u2019t wait to get out there,\u201d and Courtney Lawes: \u201cI am very, very excited.\u201d They were grinning like kids who have burst into their parents\u2019 bedroom on Christmas morning.\n\nEngland and Billy Vunipola expect hot reception from Tonga under the dome Read more\n\nIf they were worried about anything, it was that the team are too wound up. Both mentioned it, which tells you it is something they have all been talking about in their meetings. \u201cWe have to contain ourselves,\u201d said Lawes, echoing Ford, who said: \u201cWe need that balance of keeping our control and our discipline.\u201d\n\nWhich is where Farrell comes in. The captain, arms folded across his chest, was just as calm and level\u2011headed as he always is and has been. You guess on his Christmas mornings he left the presents to his siblings and skipped out to practise his kicking.\n\n\u201cI probably try and take more of the emotion out of it because I need to be able to think clearly and make good decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to be in control of what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t want your emotions to control you.\u201d\n\nFor the next 10 minutes, Farrell beat back everyone\u2019s enthusiastic questions like he was brushing off tacklers. This tournament, he said, only defines your career \u201cuntil your next\u201d, and yes, it\u2019s good to be playing outside his old mate Ford, but \u201cthere are a lot of people who have good relationships in this team\u201d, and yes, he did learn a lot playing for the Lions but \u201cthis is a completely new tournament and a new environment\u201d, and yes, he can vaguely recall David Beckham scoring a match-winning penalty against Argentina here in 2002, \u201cbut we\u2019ve not watched it and it was a while ago now.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Owen Farrell trains in Sapporo on Saturday.

It is not that Farrell is hiding anything, just that he is too blunt to pretend he wants to engage with any of it. Scratch him and you will likely find he is the same underneath the surface and all the way through. That makes him a reassuringly steady presence in the middle of this whirlwind that has swept up his coach, teammates and everyone else around him. Farrell has not even considered what he will say before the game: \u201cI\u2019d be worried if I had thought about it already, because there\u2019s still a while to go.\u201d\n\nFarrell will want \u2013 and need \u2013 to be this calm on the pitch, too. If there has been one big worry with his captaincy it is that he tends to bicker and snap at referees when they need careful, canny management. He also needs to be careful with those rash high tackles, when he leads with his shoulder rather than his arms. He says he has adjusted his technique. Listening to him talk, it feels like he was easing himself into just the right mindset for that first match.\n\n\u201cEmotion is a big part of the game, it\u2019s a big part of getting yourself in the right place to perform, for some more than others. But everyone\u2019s a bit different in terms of the way they use that.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand stand firm against South Africa in heavyweight thriller Read more\n\nThere was one topic Farrell warmed to and that was the message he had for everyone watching at home.\n\n\u201cI already know how good the nation is at getting behind the team at tournaments like this. We\u2019ve all been one of those fans, whether it was for the football World Cup, cricket World Cup, you seen the momentum that gathers back home and I\u2019m sure those teams were able to feed off that. Hopefully we can give them something to cheer about while we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThis is the sort of everyday stuff Farrell loves to talk about. The team, he says, had all watched the cricket World Cup final together: \u201cBrilliant, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever a team has got to the knockout stages and built some momentum the country goes mental for it and the football World Cup last year was a massive example of that. The cricket World Cup again showed loads of momentum towards the end, the Women\u2019s World Cup was brilliant, too. England\u2019s a fantastic place when it builds that momentum when there\u2019s a tournament on.\u201d\n\nFarrell came into the team right after England had blown one chance at all this, in 2011, and was part of the team that squandered another, in 2015. He is 27 now and he looks sounds and feels as if he\u2019s ready for a taste of it himself.", "description": "Owen Farrell, England\u2019s captain, remains firmly stoic but he is desperate to spark Rugby World Cup mania back home, he tells Andy Bull", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cba2696e3dc0fc36b52134b1cf3317e78ed9216/0_104_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9812b87511a0584f8c9f5253d5b20c3a", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
