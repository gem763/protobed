Ho is the host of a podcast called \u201cRacist Sandwich,\u201d on which she makes the case that various aspects of America\u2019s food culture is \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nThe podcast\u2019s episodes often feature quirky titles such as \u201cSheet Pan Chicken with a Side of Social Justice.\u201d In one episode, emphasized featured the author of a cookbook entitled, Feed the Resistance. During the episode, the pair suggested that Thanksgiving was a symbol of America\u2019s oppression of Native Americans.\n\nHo was hosted at Yale Wednesday night by several progressive organizations including the Poynter Fellowship in Journalism, the Yale Sustainable Food Program, the Timothy Dwight College, the Asian American Cultural Center, and the Yale Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration.\n\n\u201cHo is a food, culture, and travel writer. She is the host of the award-winning podcasts \u2018Racist Sandwich,\u2019 which focuses on the intersections of race, gender, and class within the food industry, and \u2018Popaganda,\u2019 which discusses pop culture through a feminist lens,\u201d a press release on the event read. \u201c\u2018Racist Sandwich\u2019 was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Broadcast Media Award in 2019.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Ho argued that the popularity of Popeye\u2019s chicken sandwich made Americans forget about more important issues, such as immigration crisis and the tragic lives of the factory-farmed chickens that are used to make the sandwiches.\n\nThe circus [around the sandwich] is ridiculous enough to make one forget about actual kids, the ones whose tear-streaked faces we all watched on television after their parents were detained by ICE at the Mississippi poultry factory that employed them. And consider, for a moment, the life of the factory-farmed chicken that will eventually become a well-seasoned, fried mass at a place like Popeyes. The reality is likely worse than whatever you\u2019ve imagined.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on Yale.", "description": "On Wednesday evening, Yale University hosted Soleil Ho, a podcaster that argues that American food culture is racist.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Hamburger--640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
