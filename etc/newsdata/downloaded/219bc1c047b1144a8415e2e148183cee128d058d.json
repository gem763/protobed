Both ports recorded a strong increase in imports this year.\n\nIn comments published on their public social media account, analysts at consultancy Today Think Tank Energy said coal imports at those two ports had stopped this week and they expected further restrictions to apply.\n\nThe analysts argued that foreign coal imports into China had been higher than expected this year, which meant there was still an incentive for Beijing to impose further restrictions to boost the domestic price.\n\nChina\u2019s coal imports are expected to rise more than 10 per cent this year, higher than previous forecasts. Customs data showed China imported 251 million tonnes of coal for the first three quarters of the calendar year, up 9.5 per cent.", "description": "While there had been hopes in Canberra that the unofficial quota on Australian coal exports to China would be wound back shortly, there are signs that the restrictions could remain in force for a while.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.247%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dad2897bb68a77304812083c0a8df15b3dbdff09", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
