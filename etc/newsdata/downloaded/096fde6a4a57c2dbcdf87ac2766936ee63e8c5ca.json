Hogg was replaced by Augustus Tang, who had previously headed Swire\u2019s aircraft maintenance company.\n\nThe exit of Slosar, a former Cathay CEO who has spent 39 years with Swire, and the appointment of Healy will take effect after Cathay\u2019s Nov. 6 board meeting.\n\nCathay said last month forward bookings had declined sharply as a result of the unrest.\n\nWhen asked about staff participating in protests, Slosar said last month the airline \u201cwouldn\u2019t dream\u201d of telling staff \u201cwhat to think about something\u201d.\n\nTwo days later, China\u2019s aviation regulator said crew who engaged in the protests posed a threat to safety and should be suspended from staffing flights to the mainland and over its airspace.\n\nPilots and cabin crew at the airline have since described a \u201cwhite terror\u201d of political denunciations, sackings and phone searches by Chinese aviation officials.\n\nIn a memo to staff after his resignation and which was seen by Reuters, Slosar said recent weeks had brought some of the most \u201cextraordinary and challenging times we have ever experienced\u201d.\n\nHe said that for an airline, however, volatility is normal and Cathay had emerged stronger in the past when it faced challenging times.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Cathay Pacific Group Chairman John Slosar attends a news conference on the carrier's annual results in Hong Kong, China March 14, 2018.
