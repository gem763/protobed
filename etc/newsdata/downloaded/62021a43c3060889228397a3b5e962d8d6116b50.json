You could download it right here if you wanted to.\n\nMany smartphone makers, including Huawei, already use the open source Android operating system and add their own interface to give their smartphones extra features that the base Android operating system doesn't have, so there's nothing new about Huawei using open source Android operating system.\n\nThe part that matters and now makes the biggest difference between Huawei's Mate 30 phones and other Android phones is \"Google Mobile Services\" (GMS), which includes Google's own apps like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Maps, as well as the Google Play Store, which gives users access to other popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, and Snapchat, among others.\n\nGMS requires licensing from Google. For the Mate 30 smartphones, Huawei wasn't able to obtain the GMS license due to the US government's ban.\n\nRead more: Huawei's new Mate 30 flagship phone doesn't come with any Google apps, and it's the first big tech casualty of the US-China trade war\n\nHuawei's blacklisted status puts the company's latest smartphones at an incredible disadvantage in markets outside of China, because the company's new Mate 30 smartphones won't be appealing to anyone who's used to Google apps and other popular apps they want.\n\nHuawei has its own apps for the Mate 30 phones in its Huawei Mobile Services package, which includes a photo gallery, a web browser, and Huawei's own AppGallery app store. But at this stage, it's unlikely that Huawei's apps and app store can compete with Google's own apps and the Google Play Store, at least in Europe and elsewhere where Huawei phones have been successful.\n\nIn fact, Huawei's consumer chief, Richard Yu, appealed to developers to create apps for the Mate 30 and Huawei smartphone ecosystem during the Mate 30's launch event on Thursday.\n\nWithin China, however, the Mate 30 smartphones are likely business as usual. Android smartphone users in China haven't had access to the Google Play Store since 2010, and Chinese app developers have made their own hugely popular apps like social media platform Weibo, ecommerce app TaoBao, and the \"Netflix of China,\" IQIYI.", "description": "Google's Android operating system is freely available for anyone to use \u2014 it's the Android app store that Huawei doesn't have access to.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8395432e22af209c70c5e3-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
