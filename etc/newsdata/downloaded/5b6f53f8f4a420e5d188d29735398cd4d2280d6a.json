Mario Madera-Rodriguez, 34, and Navy Special Operations Chief Tony DeDolph, 40, were referred to a court-martial on murder and other charges that could land them with life sentences.\n\nAn admiral made the decision after the evidence against the pair was laid out at a hearing in Norfolk, Virginia, last month, where two other military men who copped pleas took the stand against DeDolph and Madera-Rodriguez.\n\nAccording to testimony by Marine Staff Sgt. Kevin Maxwell and Chief Special Warfare Operator Adam Matthews, Melgar ditched the rest of the team on the way to a party at the French embassy\u2014and they decided to get revenge by hazing him.\n\nIn the dead of night, they used a sledgehammer to break into Melgar\u2019s room and then rushed him. DeDolph allegedly applied a choke hold while Matthews and Maxwell duct-taped Melgar\u2019s arms and legs.\n\n\u201cThe overall intent wasn\u2019t to hurt him,\u201d Matthews said.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the group also planned to have a local man molest Melgar, but the admiral declined to add sexual misconduct charges to the court-martial.\n\nDeDolph\u2019s attorney, Phil Stackhouse, has argued the evidence does not support murder charges.\n\n\u201cClearly what happened is a horrible, tragic accident,\u201d Stackhouse said. \u201cBased on all the facts in this case, nobody went into that room to kill Staff Sgt. Melgar.\u201d", "description": "A Navy SEAL and a Marine face potential life sentences if convicted at a court-martial.", "authors": ["Tracy Connor", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569014991/190920-connor-melgar-tease_jcc9po", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
