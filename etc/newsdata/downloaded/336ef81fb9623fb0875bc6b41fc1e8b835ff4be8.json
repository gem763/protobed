Sen. Bernie Sanders promised a \u201cjobs guarantee,\u201d Andrew Yang touted his \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d \u2014 which would be a $1,000 monthly check for each American adult \u2014 and Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged higher wages for childcare workers and pre-school teachers.\n\nIn contrast, Trump\u2019s team emailed reporters a list of favorable media quotes admitting that his lower-immigration economy is helping to raise wages after decades of minimal growth. The email, which was sent mid-debate, was headlined: \u201cBlue-collar workers are seeing big benefits from the Trump economy,\u201d and it said:\n\nAmerica\u2019s historic low unemployment rate of 3.5%, the lowest in fifty years, is unlocking opportunities for working class Americans.\n\nFrom the Chicago Tribune: \u201cWhat\u2019s most heartening is that this jobs boom is helping the less-educated, low-skill Americans who\u2019ve missed out on other, weaker jobs recoveries. Mark this moment: Millions of American job seekers have prayed for it.\u201d Meanwhile, wage growth has exceeded 3% for eight out of nine months in 2019, and February\u2019s wage growth of 3.4% was the strongest growth in a decade. Moreover, for the first time since 2009, the benefits of wage growth are predominantly going to \u201cworkers at the lower end of the pay scale.\u201d From the New York Times: \u201cThe decade-long recovery is at last delivering income gains to middle-class and low-income families.\u201d\n\nFrom the Washington Post: \u201cThe surge of minority women getting jobs has helped push the U.S. workforce across a historic threshold. For the first time, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) are people of color.\u201d\n\nFrom the Economic Policy Institute: \u201cFrom 2017 to 2018, relatively fast growth continued at the top\u2026but the 20th and 30th percentiles saw the strongest growth at 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe Census Bureau said on September 10 that men who work full time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.\n\nCNN and the New York Times also choose to ignore the decisive issue of 2016 \u2014 immigration, which has cut Americans\u2019 wages amid a post-1990 flood of cheaper labor.\n\nFor example, income growth is lagging for American graduates, partly because the federal government allows investors to keep roughly 1.5 million college-graduate visa workers in good jobs sought by American graduates.\n\nWhite House touts modest wage-gains in Trump's Buy/Hire American economy. Puzzle #1: Wage gains for college-grads lag behind gains for non-college employees. Puzzle #2: Why do white-collar journos not investigate slowdown to their college peers' salaries? https://t.co/TYy7deCWQ8 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 15, 2019\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.\n\nBut the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.\n\nThis policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nThe federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.", "description": "CNN, the NYT, and the candidates at Tuesday's Democrat debate in Ohio ignored the huge issue of Americans' flat wages and stalled salaries.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Trump-New-Mexico-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
