The Witcher has its own world and universe.\u2019\n\nThe Judy actor also claims that the show, based on Polish author Andrzej Sapkowsk\u2019s original novels, will not shy away from intimate character studies \u2013 something which HBO\u2019s juggernaut was also known for (well, until the last season at least).\n\n\u2018[It] has its own proper characters and their own struggles,\u2019 he claimed.\n\n\u2018And I think that\u2019s what people will see and really connect with. It\u2019s a huge scale project \u2013 it\u2019s very intimate in terms of the character studies, which is what I love. When it comes to taking a role, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe official synopsis reads: \u2018Based on the best-selling fantasy series of books, The Witcher is an epic tale of fate and family. Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than beasts.\n\n\u2018But when destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a young princess with a dangerous secret, the three must learn to navigate the increasingly volatile Continent together.\u2019\n\nThe Witcher will air on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
