We go from Russia to Ukraine. How did that happen? The Democrats, Nancy Pelosi, and six committee chairmen, I call them her politburo, are running roughshod or trying to, over the president of the United States, the executive branch, and so forth, issuing letters that they call subpoenas, and if the letters aren\u2019t replied to in a certain given of time, they\u2019re claiming that it is obstruction of justice. Of course, it can\u2019t be obstruction of justice \u2014 they\u2019re not at court. They mean obstruction of the House.\u201d\n\nLevin went on to argue the Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t have anything\u201d on Trump when it comes to Russia or Ukraine and questioned why House Democrats are treating Trump differently than presidents previously in impeachment inquiries.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During his Sunday Fox News Channel show, \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" Mark Levin took aim at the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/levin-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
