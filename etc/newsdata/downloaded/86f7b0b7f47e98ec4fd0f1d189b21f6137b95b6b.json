It is not only yesterday and today. He is feeling the supporters don\u2019t like him.\n\n\u201cHis commitment with the club is a great commitment every time. He wants to help. His behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and with the club. He was wrong and he feels it inside very deeply. But that is normal as a human.\u201d\n\nEmery admitted he felt Xhaka should have said sorry to supporters but insists he is not interested in receiving an apology of his own.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him this morning about him only, his personal moment,\u201d added the Spaniard. \u201cI don\u2019t need his apology. Because I know he is devastated, we can speak about all the situation but first it\u2019s him.\n\n\u201cHe is now very down and we need to support him. I don\u2019t need his apology to me now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ideal future is to watch again Xhaka playing and every supporter supporting him. This is my ideal. I don\u2019t know if I can or will achieve it but this is my ideal. Also for him it\u2019s the same but also I think we need now to be calm step by step so we can progress. But my idea is to achieve a big connection collectively and individually with the supporters. We can maybe remind some similar situations in the past for players, and they came back.\n\n\u201cFor example, I was speaking with Hector Bellerin and he said to me that he received some criticism three years ago at Emirates Stadium in one moment because people weren\u2019t happy with his performance and then he came back. The most important is to keep moving ahead, working, improving and showing and transmitting to people that if one moment they don\u2019t like him, to work to change that situation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know not today how it will be in the future, the most important for me is the present.\u201d", "description": "Footage has emerged of Arsenal fans hurling abuse at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u00a0in the wake of the club\u2019s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace.
