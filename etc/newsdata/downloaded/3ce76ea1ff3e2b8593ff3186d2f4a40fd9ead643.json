A senior White House adviser blames the \u201cdeep state.\u201d And a Republican congressman is pointing at Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nAs the Democrats drive an impeachment inquiry toward a potential vote by the end of the year, President Donald Trump\u2019s allies are struggling over how he should manage the starkest threat to his presidency. The jockeying broke into the open Sunday on the talk-show circuit, with a parade of Republicans erupting into a surge of second-guessing.\n\nAt the top of the list: Rudy Giuliani\u2019s false charge that it was Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 elections. The former New York mayor has been encouraging Ukraine to investigate both Biden and Hillary Clinton\n\n\u201cI am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again,\u201d said Tom Bossert, Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser. \u201cThat conspiracy theory has got to go, they have to stop with that, it cannot continue to be repeated.\u201d\n\nNot only did Giuliani repeat it Sunday, he brandished pieces of paper he said were affidavits supporting his story.\n\n\u201cTom Bossert doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Guiliani said. He added that Trump was framed by the Democrats.\n\nSenior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, meanwhile, noted that he\u2019s worked in the federal government \u201cfor nearly three years.\n\n\u201cI know the difference between whistleblower and a deep-state operative,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThis is a deep state operative, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, heatedly said Trump was merely asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to root out corruption. That, Jordan said, includes Hunter Biden\u2019s membership on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\nMixed messaging reflects the difficulty Republicans are having defending the president against documents released by the White House that feature Trump\u2019s own words and actions. A partial transcript and a whistleblower report form the heart of the House impeachment inquiry and describe Trump pressuring a foreign president to investigate Biden\u2019s family.\n\nIn a series of tweets Sunday night, Trump said he deserved to meet \u201cmy accuser\u201d as well as whoever provided the whistleblower with what the president called \u201clargely incorrect\u201d information. He also accused Democrats of \u201cdoing great harm to our Country\u201d in an effort to destabilize the nation and the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has insisted the call was \u201cperfect\u201d and pushed to release both documents.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even know that it was wrong,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, describing a phone call from Trump in which the president suggested the documents would exonerate him.\n\nBut Democrats seized on them as evidence that Trump committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d by asking for a foreign leader\u2019s help undermining a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden. Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry and on Sunday told other Democrats that public sentiment had swung behind the probe.\n\nBy all accounts, the Democratic impeachment effort was speeding ahead with a fair amount of coordination between Pelosi, Democratic messaging experts and its political operation.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday that he expects the whistleblower to testify \u201cvery soon,\u201d though details were still being worked out and no date had been set. Hearings and depositions were starting this week. Many Democrats are pushing for a vote on articles of impeachment before the end of the year, mindful of the looming 2020 elections.\n\nSchiff said in one interview that his committee intends to subpoena Giuliani for documents and may eventually want to hear from Giuliani directly. In a separate TV appearance, Giuliani said he would not cooperate with Schiff, but then acknowledged he would do what Trump tells him. The White House did not provide an official response on whether the president would allow Giuliani to cooperate.\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower expressed concern about that individual\u2019s safety, noting that some have offered a $50,000 \u201cbounty\u201d for the whistleblower\u2019s identity. They said they expect the situation to become even more dangerous for their client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter.\n\nOn a conference call Sunday, Pelosi, traveling in Texas, urged Democrats to proceed \u201cnot with negative attitudes towards him, but a positive attitude towards our responsibility,\u201d according to an aide on the call who shared the exchange on condition of anonymity. Polling, Pelosi said, had changed \u201cdrastically\u201d in the Democrats\u2019 favor.\n\nA one-day NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted Sept. 25 found that about half of Americans - 49% - approve of the House formally starting an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThere remains a stark partisan divide on the issue, with 88% of Democrats approving and 93% of Republicans disapproving of the inquiry. But the findings suggest some movement in opinions on the issue. Earlier polls conducted throughout Trump\u2019s presidency have consistently found a majority saying he should not be impeached and removed from office.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York urged the caucus to talk about impeachment by repeating the words \u201cbetrayal, abuse of power, national security.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 campaign arm swung behind lawmakers to support the impeachment drive as they run for reelection, according to another call participant to spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe contrast with the Republicans\u2019 selection of responses was striking.\n\nA combative House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said that nothing in Trump\u2019s phone call rose to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cWhy would we move forward on impeachment?\u201d the California Republican said. \u201cThere\u2019s not something that you have to defend here.\u201d\n\nBossert, an alumnus of Republican George W. Bush\u2019s administration, offered a theory and some advice to Trump: Move past the fury over the 2016 Russia investigation, in which special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy but plenty of examples of Trump\u2019s obstruction.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe this president has not gotten his pound of flesh yet from past grievances on the 2016 investigation,\u201d Bossert said. \u201cIf he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nTwo advisers to the Biden campaign sent a letter Sunday urging major news networks to stop booking Giuliani on their shows, accusing Trump\u2019s personal attorney of spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories\u201d on behalf of the president. The letter to management and anchors of shows at ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN and Fox News added: \u201cBy giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGiuliani appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d while Schiff was interviewed on ABC and NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Bossert spoke on ABC and Miller on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Jordan appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Pelosi and McCarthy appeared on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking, Eric Tucker and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington; writer Bill Barrow in Atlanta; and AP Polling Director Emily Swanson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The president's lawyer insists the real story is a debunked conspiracy theory.
