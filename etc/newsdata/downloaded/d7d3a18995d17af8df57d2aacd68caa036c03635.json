It\u2019s a late August morning, milder than usual for Nashville, and Crow is just back from a girls\u2019 trip to Blackberry Mountain, a resort in the Great Smoky Mountains in Walland, Tennessee. Though confident in her decision, she says that Threads, which came out August 30 from The Valory Music Co., will be her final \u201cfull artistic statement.\u201d The record is a culmination of sorts of the songwriter\u2019s decades-long career, a testament to the friendships and connections she\u2019s made in her career.\n\nThreads started while Crow, 57, was recording with Kris Kristofferson. She and Kristofferson recorded a new version of his 1972 song \u201cBorder Lord,\u201d and from there, Crow decided she\u2019d call up some friends to collaborate. Crow brought together old legends and legends in the making: Neil Young and country artists Lukas Nelson and Margo Price join Crow on \u201cCross Creek Road,\u201d which she wrote with her longtime songwriting partner Jeff Trott; Public Enemy\u2019s Chuck D, blues guitarist Gary Clark Jr. and soul singer Andra Day come together for the anti\u2013gun violence track \u201cStory of Everything\u201d; Stevie Nicks and Maren Morris harmonize on opener \u201cProve You Wrong\u201d; and Bonnie Raitt and Mavis Staples jam with Crow on the bluesy \u201cLive Wire.\u201d Eric Clapton, Sting, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris and James Taylor all make appearances as well.\n\nCrow, who at one point does her dishes while on the phone (\u201cAlways multitasking,\u201d she says, \u201calways multitasking\u201d), gets choked up while talking about the threads in her musical and personal life that led to this record\u2014particularly when mentioning her children, 12-year-old Wyatt and 9-year-old Levi. Though Threads might sound more like a classic rock or country album than her 1993 debut, Tuesday Night Music Club, Crow\u2019s new record stays true to her style. Here, she tells WSJ. how it all came about and what she hopes for the future.\n\nWill Threads really be your last album? How did you come to that decision?\n\nWell, I say, Never say never. [But] I\u2019m very comfortable with this being my last full artistic statement. I think it\u2019s a wonderful way to end that tradition of making albums. I\u2019ll definitely continue to write music, and as it seems pertinent, I\u2019ll put songs out. We had such a great experience last year with the song \u201cWouldn\u2019t Want to Be Like You\u201d and the fact that it was so immediate, addressing what was happening in the world\u2014particularly in the United States, particularly in our government\u2014with the idea that the truth has become so inconvenient. To be able to just put something out and have it feel of-the-moment, there\u2019s something wonderful about that. The other thing is that with technology, people are making their own playlists, cherry-picking songs, and I\u2019m not convinced they listen to albums anymore. Maybe the tried-and-true fan does, but for the most part your music winds up on playlists.\n\nSo you\u2019re not just fed up with the album recording process after so many decades? Your decision is more of a reaction to the music landscape right now?\n\nIt\u2019s more about not being able to put the toothpaste back in the tube. We are where we are, technology-wise, and people get music the way they get it. If I were to make a decision about recording more albums based on my experience with this one, I would make albums every day of my life. It was such a wonderful experience. So emotional and humbling to be able to work with all these artists. That\u2019s another reason that I love this being sort of my swan song, because it\u2019s really the summation of my musical career, my musical life. Starting with reading album covers as a 7- or 8-year-old girl in a tiny town of three stoplights, to many, many years later, reflecting on how many heroes I\u2019ve met and how much they\u2019ve enhanced my life.\n\nGiven all your collaborating, especially on this record, how do you remain Sheryl Crow?\n\nTo be honest, and I say this unabashedly, I have made a career out of \u201ctributing\u201d my influences. I wear them on my sleeve. I\u2019m proud of the people I listened to growing up, and they are part of my musical fiber. It wasn\u2019t hard for me to sit down and think about what kind of song would hold the weight for Willie Nelson to want to sing it. I just dipped into that mind-set.\n\nI\u2019m proud of my influences! And I feel like the younger people on this record, you can hear where they\u2019ve come from.\n\nDoes any one story from the recording process stick out to you?\n\nI have a gazillion stories. Or as my 9-year-old would say: \u201celeventy-million.\u201d One of my favorites\u2014and this is one that, to me, is the perfect illustration of this album: I was a young schoolteacher in St. Louis in the mid-\u201980s, and I went to see the Chuck Berry [documentary] Hail! Hail! Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll being filmed. I was in the audience, and there was Keith Richards, and there was Steve Jordan, who produced [Threads]. Cut to some 30-odd years later, here I am with this record, and having spent two days in New York City with my dear friend Keith and the captain of my ship, Steve Jordan. You can\u2019t write that in a movie and have it be believable. In some ways, this album is the journey between my being in that audience as a young schoolteacher, to now. And the incredible road trip that has occurred.\n\nDid you see that Maren Morris said [her Country supergroup] The Highwomen wouldn\u2019t exist without you?\n\nListen, that makes me cry. Because they are just amazing. They are tremendous, and they are the real deal, and I love every one of them. [Highwomen member] Brandi [Carlile] is on this record, and she will make you cry singing \u201cBeware of Darkness,\u201d the George Harrison song. Being the mother she is, the mother earth she is. I mean, wow. I love that.\n\nWhy did you choose that song of his to cover?\n\nIf he were alive, he would have been my first call. The way he lived his life was such an inspiration to my own meditation practice, and the idea of manifesting peace within in order to manifest peace without. I knew him a little bit, through the years, before he passed. That song felt so necessary to me for this record because of my children, the idea that we\u2019re at a point in our evolution where we really have to warn against darkness. We have to teach our young children that what resonates as darkness, that\u2019s probably [darkness]. Right now, that\u2019s a heavy message.\n\nWhat\u2019s being a mom like for you?\n\nIt\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to my life, and I barely remember my life before my kids. It\u2019s been incredible showing them the world. It\u2019s been humbling, as of late, to know that what I model to them informs so deeply who they will become and how they will see the world. The unfortunate thing about it is, they\u2019re very young and should be totally experiencing life filled with innocence. They\u2019re asking the hard questions that I don\u2019t have answers for. That part of it makes me mad, and it winds up on the records. I can\u2019t shake that when I walk in to write a song. The fact that my 9-year-old is worrying about not being able to breathe\u2014in his lifetime! I mean that\u2019s crazy, that they\u2019re already experiencing the idea of mortality, and they\u2019re not even teenagers yet. It\u2019s an amazing thing to be their mom, and kids are much more aware and probably more savvy than I was when I was 10. But it\u2019s full-time. It definitely makes you straighten your back up and really think about the decisions you make and the words you speak.\n\nIs there a song from Threads they especially like?\n\nThey love \u201cProve You Wrong.\u201d I think because of the beat, and they\u2019ve heard it a lot. My 12-year-old learned how to play \u201cLive Wire,\u201d and he was all about that for a while, probably because of the groove. He was playing cello in the orchestra in school, and he came home one day and said, \u201cI\u2019m switching to bass.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy are you switching to bass? You were so great on cello!\u201d And he said, \u201cBecause you play bass, and I want to be in your band when I turn 19.\u201d So, once I quit crying about it, I had this flash of, \u201cWhen you\u2019re 19, the last person you\u2019re going to want to play with in their band is your mom, but I love you.\u201d That right there is manna from heaven. Just kill me now!\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "The Americana songwriter on her star-studded album Threads and what it\u2019s like to make music with her heroes", "authors": ["Leah Mandel"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109360/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
