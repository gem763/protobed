Our currency has lost 75% of its value.\u201d\n\nZarif combined the cudgel of threats with a recent diplomatic blitz, including two sessions with Macron over the past week and a tour through Scandinavia followed by meetings with leaders in Japan, China, Malaysia and, in the coming days, Russia. He said that if a credit system is not in motion by Sept. 6, Iran will take a \u201cthird step\u201d in reducing its JCPOA commitments. In the first two steps, on May 8 and July 7, Iran said it would exceed a 300-kilogram cap on its low-enriched uranium stockpile and slightly upgraded enrichment past the 3.67% limit in the JCPOA.\n\nZarif\u2019s mission during his three-hour stopover in Biarritz at the G-7 and in subsequent travels has been to press ahead for some form of exceptions for certain countries from US sanctions on Iranian oil exports, if that can be worked out, and to establish a credit line to partly compensate Iran for the oil it would have sold to Europe after the United States withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions and enable financing for Iranian purchase of humanitarian goods permitted under US sanctions. A line of credit could be implemented via INSTEX, the EU barter arrangement to allow trade and investment in non-sanctioned sectors, or some other financial mechanism, reports Al-Monitor's Rohollah Faghihi.\n\nIn his remarks with Macron at the G-7, Trump seemed well briefed on this effort thanks to Macron.\n\nWhile the media focus of Zarif\u2019s G-7 stop was mostly on the prospects of a Trump-Rouhani summit, the discussions on the credit line may have been what Zarif most needed at this stage, if not all he may have wanted.\n\nRouhani\u2019s chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, said Iran is \u201calmost making good progress\u201d with Europe, writes Faghihi, and that an \u201ceconomic group\u201d from Iran will travel to France next week.\n\nMacron the mediator\n\nMacron, who drew attention for his gambit of inviting Zarif to the G-7 sidelines, has seized the initiative to save what he can of the Iran deal and move ahead on a new agreement that could be acceptable to the United States and Iran, Laura Rozen reports.\n\nThe French president is a freelancer, suggests David Ignatius. To the contrary, Macron is working the diplomatic channels like a pro. Most importantly, he and Trump have a connection and trust. Trump has made clear Macron doesn\u2019t speak for him, and Macron doesn\u2019t claim to do so. Meanwhile, the French president has developed a strong relationship with Rouhani. Macron is running point within the EU on Iran and the other two European signatories to the JCPOA \u2014 the United Kingdom and Germany \u2014 will follow his, and ultimately Trump\u2019s, lead.\n\nRussia and China are also committed as signatories to the nuclear deal, and both would likely support an arrangement that allows Iran to sell or pre-sell oil, which would in turn facilitate their trade with the sanctioned country. Russian President Vladimir Putin is of course a wild card and is already positioning himself as a broker by offering his own security concept for the Gulf area, which has so far gained little traction in Washington, Tehran or the region. A rollout of the proposal, which includes plans for a major conference, had been planned around Sept. 20 but was postponed. The concept was circulated at the United Nations in June.\n\n\u201cMoscow is not going to pressure Tehran for better relations with the United States, but it can play the role of mediator,\u201d writes Nikolay Kozhonov. And if the crisis over the JCPOA continues, Russia can live with that too. \u201cIf Iran is ready to provide Russia greater access to its economy,\u201d adds Kozhonov. \u201cMoscow can start gradually increasing Iran\u2019s support via the participation in the gray schemes of sanctions evasion and provision of limited diplomatic support.\u201d\n\nRouhani on defense\n\nBack in Tehran, Rouhani has had to defend his and Zarif\u2019s fragile efforts not to let the JCPOA, their signature diplomatic achievement, deteriorate further.\n\nHard-line critics forced Rouhani to walk back his Aug. 26 statement, \u201cIf I think that meeting with someone can resolve my country\u2019s problems, I will not hesitate, because protecting the national interests of my country is a principle for me,\u201d widely interpreted as a sign that a meeting with Trump was a possibility. Just 24 hours later came the remark about no meetings or photo-ops until all sanctions are lifted.\n\nRouhani defended the JCPOA as the antidote for what ails Iran\u2019s economy, saying, \u201cSome keep asking that what was the result of negotiation with major powers. After the negotiations, we were exporting over 2.8 million barrels of oil, and billions of dollars of our assets came back to the country.\u201d More pointedly to critics, he added, \u201cSome do not say a word about foreign investments made in our country, but when foreign investors leave the country, they start criticizing about them leaving.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Rouhani backed up Zarif\u2019s diplomacy, saying, \u201cThe fact that our country\u2019s foreign minister has visited different parts of the world and is negotiating, visiting France twice in a week, means that the government is making a tremendous effort in serving people and defending their interests. \u2026 We need to take advantage of our friendly countries\u2019 potential to reduce the problems.\u201d\n\nIs the door still open?\n\nIn Iran, the door to talks with the United States may seem closed, but it remains open, if just a crack. \u201cThere is the possibility,\u201d Faghihi writes, \u201cthat after the attacks by hard-liners, Rouhani may have adopted a strategy to refuse a possible meeting publicly in order to relieve himself of the internal oppositions\u2019 pressure \u2014 all while secretly continuing on the path to negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe door remains open for Trump as well. On this, he has been consistent. In response to a question as to whether it seems \u201crealistic\u201d that he could meet Rouhani \u201cwithin weeks,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cWell, it does,\u201d and that Rouhani is \u201ca great negotiator.\u201d Trump added, \u201cThe sanctions are absolutely hurting them horribly. I don\u2019t want to see that. \u2026 They\u2019re great people.\u201d\n\nIf the Trump administration allows a credit deal to proceed, Iran should take it as good will for a possible meeting and to keep Macron engaged.\n\nAs other world leaders have discovered, Trump likes to cut deals in person. Given the impact of sanctions on the Iranian economy, Rouhani might keep the prospect alive, if carefully. His critics at home offer only rhetoric and confrontation, not solutions to Iran\u2019s economic crisis. A better bet may be to follow Macron\u2019s lead.", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron, the man in the middle, is appealing to both sides for compromise.", "authors": ["Week In Review"], "top_image": "https://9c998969b63acdb676d1-37595348221e1b716e1a6cfee3ed7891.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/almpics/2019/08/RTS2NYMG.jpg/RTS2NYMG-870.jpg"}
