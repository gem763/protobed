'He's a very nice man, a really phenomenal soldier, who does a lot of work for other people, for charities, for veterans, for Sentebale charity, for children in Africa, and I think under great scrutiny they seem to try a lot for other people. So the vitriol seems a bit like leaning on bullying to me.'\n\nHis remarks to Ben Shephard and Penny Lancaster on this morning's show follow Meghan's appearance at the 2019 One Young World summit last night.\n\nJames Blunt is pictured (left) with Sofia Wellesley at Windsor Castle for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on May 19 2018.
