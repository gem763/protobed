Guy crossing road vs guy parked on crossing.'\n\nThe video shows a man wearing dark sunglasses walking across the road as he carries a stick in his right hand.\n\nThe man walks around the red car with his stick in front of him.\n\nHe then stops in front of the car's bonnet and whacks the windscreen with his stick. The driver leaps out of his car to confront the man.\n\nThe driver walks towards the man with his arms spread just as the dash cam car drives on.\n\nA street photograph shows tactile paving on each side of the dropped kerb pavements.\n\nThe video has left many people divided as to who is at fault with many criticising the stick bearing man.\n\nFrustrated, he slams his white stick on the vehicle's windscreen as the driver leaps out to confront him\n\nOwen Hopkins said: 'It's not a crossing, and even if it is double yellows, only the law or parking officer can enforce that, if someone damaged my car I would walk through them, end of, a car is the second most expensive thing most people will buy.\n\n'You wouldn't accept someone bricking your house windows whether you were in the wrong or not!'\n\nIan Harris added: 'The 'blind' man is wrong he has a white stick which didn't touch the parked car yet knew exactly where it was to walk around it, knew where the gap between the cars was, and knew where the windscreen was.'\n\nRob Phipps wrote: 'Pedestrian. Criminal damage to a vehicle. Could have spoke to the bloke and why only his car.'\n\nNeil Froggett said: 'No need for that behaviour really, you'd expect that from a jumped up teenager not a grown man!'\n\nOther argued the driver was to blame.\n\nThe clip was posted to Facebook on Monday by the page 'Spotted Coventry City', with the poster asking: 'Who is in the wrong? Guy crossing road vs guy parked on crossing'\n\nChris Tate said: 'It is double yellows there for a start, the driver is wrong which also [means] all the cars in front of him are wrong too, but hey its 2019 most drivers don't care for road laws or safety or anything remotely regarding common sense, or not about their own selfishness.'\n\nMark McLellan added: 'Parked on the crossing is wrong and you do not square up to anyone with a disability.'\n\nAmy-Louise Swatman wrote: 'I mean some people need to learn the rules of the road.'\n\nAndrew Wiltshier said: 'He has no right to park there, the guy has a white stick and is therefore visually impaired and had to find his way around the car, does not excuse the use of his stick to hit the windscreen.'", "description": "The clip, filmed in Coventry on October 8, shows the man having to walk around a red car because of the selfish parking.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/15/19746074-0-image-a-22_1571150790279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
