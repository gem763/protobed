But asking your husband to vacuum is not, in my eyes, a criminal offence.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"I appreciate our marriage was on the rocks but for Mike to treat me the way he did, after all the love and care I put into the relationship, was devastating.\"\n\nThe outgoing mother, who is now in a new relationship, said she was drawn to Mr Sanders despite his 'timid' personality.\n\nMs Neal, who has two children from previous relationships, said she started to resent her husband for his unwillingness to tidy up.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nThe cleaning business owner said she hated returning home from work and having to do more vacuuming.\n\nThings escalated when Mr Sanders resigned from his gym job in 2018 and stopped eating and sleeping, Ms Neal said.\n\nAfter her husband told a Job Centre employee about his troubles, the matter was passed to the police and Ms Neal was arrested.\n\nMichael gave an interview to a newspaper in June.\n\nAfter the trial collapsed he told the paper Valerie said he was training too much, that she wanted him to clean every day and would not eat the food he cooked from Aldi or Lidl.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nHe said: \"I know people might say the nagging is just married life, but this is not married life to me.\n\n\"I think it was controlling, but I\u2019m not sure if she should have gone to court or not. That was not my decision.\"\n\nCoercive and controlling behaviour - which carries a maximum sentence of five years - is a much discussed crime with the overwhelming majority of prosecutions being against men (97 per cent in England and Wales in 2016).\n\nCertainly, such offences are difficult to prosecute. Since the law came into force in December 2015, 7,034 people have been arrested but only 1,157 charged and just 235 convicted.", "description": "Valerie Neal, formerly Sanders, admitted to 'nagging' her husband but denied committing a criminal offence", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17263568.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Cleaner-58-is-arrested-and-locked-in-cells-for-17-hours-accused-of-controlling-behaviour-after-tel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
