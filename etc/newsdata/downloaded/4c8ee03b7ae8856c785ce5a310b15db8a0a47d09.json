They are among our most driven and selfless colleagues.\u201d\n\nThe 16-page plea included one legal argument: that the 443 illegal migrants deserve relief because they submitted their names to the federal government to get DACA benefits. \u201cThis Court has recognized that \u2018serious reliance interests\u2019 like these carry significant legal weight, said the document.\n\nHowever, the plea ignored the three main legal issues: Whether Barack Obama and his deputies had the legal authority to grant a blanket exemption from immigration law to roughly 800,000 young illegals, whether Obama has the legal authority to give work permits to illegals in the United States, and whether President Donald Trump has the legal authority to end Obama\u2019s blanket policy.\n\nInstead of addressing the legal issues, Cook offered broad business and moral claims that would sweep away Americans\u2019 right to border and decent wages in an American-only labor market.\n\nCook\u2019s plea described how several Apple DACA employees were brought into the United States illegally, yet he also said the migrants \u201chave done everything right \u2026 [and] follow the rules.\u201d\n\nFor example, the plea suggested that there is no moral distinction between Americans and foreigners that company executives are bound to respect, saying, \u201cone of Apple\u2019s core values is the belief that equal opportunities should be available for all, regardless of background.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn their patriotism, dedication to their families and communities, and commitment to making their country a better place, they are as American as any of us,\u201d the plea said.\n\nCook lauded the migrants\u2019 claimed \u201crich diversity\u201d without defining diversity, and ignored the trade-offs between a demand for a \u201cdiverse\u201d workforce and a most-skilled workforce:\n\nOur recipe for success is simple: Hire the best people, from the most diverse backgrounds. They will solve the most challenging technological problems. They will find new ways to connect to the broadest population and new ways to provide the best customer experience. This is Apple\u2019s innovation strategy. It is all about the people\u2014and their rich diversity.\n\nNew in Dep't of Homeland Security v. Univ. of California: Amicus brief of Tim Cook, Deirdre O'Brien and Apple submitted.https://t.co/JuUDsumezg pic.twitter.com/KAzwWnctZI \u2014 Big Cases Bot (@big_cases) October 2, 2019\n\nCook did not mention the fact that the company can hire foreign workers \u2014 including former illegals \u2014 via the nation\u2019s guest-worker and immigration programs. For example, the L-1 visa allows Apple executives to hire illegals back in their home countries and transfer them to U.S. locations. Executives can also get green cards and citizenship for their L-1 and H-1B visa workers.\n\nApple uses the legal immigration system to import thousands of foreign workers for jobs sought by Americans.\n\nThe federal date presented by MyVisaJobs.com suggests the company hired more than 2,000 foreign workers via the H-1B program and asked for green cards for another group of roughly 2,900 visa-workers. Almost 2,500 of the green-card recipients were H-1B workers, and 239 held L-1 visas which allows foreign-based employees of Apple to work in the United States\n\nThe vast majority of the imported workers came from India, according to the website:\n\nIndia(1464); China(355); Canada(225); France(82); United Kingdom(80); South Korea(56); Taiwan(53); Germany(34); Sweden(32); Italy(31)\n\n\u201cDreamers fuel creativity, broaden knowledge, and help drive innovation,\u201d Cook says. \u201cThey inspire all of us. They make Apple better. They make our country better.\u201d\n\nCook is one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders and stands to gain when the company\u2019s profits climb.\n\nThe case is Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, at the Supreme Court of the United States. The cases are numbered Nos. 18-587, 18-588, and 18-589.", "description": "Apple Inc. should be allowed to hire 'DACA' illegal migrants because they are good for the company, the company CEO tells the Supreme Court", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1167261104-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
