Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has told the New Yorker about his particular fascination with the Roman emperor, Augustus \u2013 he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have even called one of their children August.\n\n\u201cBasically, through a really harsh approach, he established 200 years of world peace,\u201d Zuckerberg explained. He pondered, \u201cWhat are the trade-offs in that? On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today ...\u201d On the other hand, he said, \u201cthat didn\u2019t come for free, and he had to do certain things\u201d.\n\nThese are the questions Brussels should have asked Mark Zuckerberg | Tristan Harris Read more\n\nZuckerberg loved Latin at school (\u201cvery much like coding\u201d, he said). His sister, Donna, got her classics PhD at Princeton, is editor of the excellent Eidolon online classics magazine, and has just written a book on how \u201calt-right\u201d, misogynist online communities invoke classical history.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether the appealing classics nerdiness of Zuckerberg\u2019s background makes his sanguine euphemisms more or less alarming. \u201cHe had to do certain things\u201d and \u201ca really harsh approach\u201d are, let\u2019s say, a relaxed way of describing Augustus\u2019 brutal and systematic elimination of political opponents. And \u201c200 years of world peace\u201d? Well yes, if that\u2019s what you want to call centuries of brutal conquest. Even the Roman historian Tacitus had something to say about that: \u201csolitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant\u201d. They make a desert and call it peace.\n\nLet\u2019s be charitable and suggest that it\u2019s not the ruthless crushing of his enemies and domination of the known world that attracts Zuckerberg to Augustus, but the intellectual exercise of thinking about the historical problem that he presents.\n\nIt\u2019s true that his reign has been reconsidered time and again: it is one of those extraordinary junctions in history \u2013 when Rome\u2019s republic teetered, crumbled, and reformed as the empire \u2013 that looks different depending on the moment from which he is examined. It is perfectly true to say that Augustus ended the civil strife that overwhelmed Rome in the late first century BC, and ushered in a period of stability and, in some ways, renewal, by the time of his death in 14 AD. That\u2019s how I was taught about Augustus at school, I suspect not uncoincidentally by someone brought up during the second world war. But in 1939 Ronald Syme had published his brilliant account of the period, The Roman Revolution \u2013 a revolutionary book in itself, challenging Augustus\u2019s then largely positive reputation by portraying him as a sinister figure who emerged on the tides of history out of the increasingly ungovernable Roman republic, to wield autocratic power.\n\nPart of the fascination of the man is that he was a master of propaganda and a superb political operator. In our own era of obfuscation, deceit and fake news it\u2019s interesting to try to unpick what was really going on. Take his brief autobiography, Res Gestae Divi Augusti. (Things Done By the Deified Augustus \u2013 no messing about here, title-wise).\n\nThe text, while heavygoing, is a fascinating document, listing his political appointments, his military achievements, the infrastructure projects he funded. But it can, with other contemporary evidence, also be interpreted as a portrait of a man who instituted an autocracy that cleverly mimicked the forms and traditions of Rome\u2019s quasi-democratic republic.\n\nUnder the guise of restoring Rome to greatness, he hollowed out its constitution and loaded power into his own hands. Something there for Zuckerberg to think about, perhaps. Particularly considering the New Yorker\u2019s headline for its profile: \u201cCan Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian\u2019s chief culture writer", "description": "The Facebook founder\u2019s bromantic hero was a canny operator who was obsessed with power and overrode democracy", "authors": ["Charlotte Higgins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b73fcd9aae1bb5ca09ee993e1bd4400a521b43e/0_204_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=153a77d1326d9be118e52b2511dd6d11", "published_at": "2018-09-12"}
