Congenital heart disease is a general term for a range of birth defects that are present at birth. The most common heart defects include: Septal defects: When there's a hole between two of the heart's chambers, which is known commonly as a 'hole in the heart'. Coarctation of the aorta: Where the main large artery of the body, is narrower than normal Pulmonary valve stenosis: When the pulmonary valve is narrower than the normal. This valce controls the flow of blood from the heart to the lungs. Transposition of the great arteries: When the pulmonary and aortic valves and the arteries they're connected to have swapped positions.\n\nThis can result in mental and physical problems in the baby including poor growth, cerebral palsy and learning difficulties.\n\nAround one in four children with FASD have congenital heart disease, indicating that alcohol may also be implicated in these disorders.\n\nPrevious studies investigating the link between alcohol and congenital heart disease have focused on prospective mothers, with inconclusive results.\n\nThis is the first study to examine the role of paternal alcohol drinking on the baby\u2019s heart health.\n\nThe researchers compiled the best data published between 1991 and 2019, which amounted to 55 studies.\n\nThey included 41,747 babies born with congenital heart disease and 297,587 without.\n\nThe analysis showed a relationship between paternal alcohol drinking and congenital heart diseases.\n\nResearchers said the chance of the birth defects rose as alcohol consumption increased.\n\nThey added there was not significant at lower quantities of alcohol consumption, but did not specify the amount.\n\nThe study also found that, compared to abstinence, maternal drinking was linked to a 20 per cent greater risk of tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nThe condition is a combination of four abnormalities in the heart's structure and strikes five out of every 10,000 births.\n\nAcademics noted that this was an observational study and does not prove an effect.\n\nThey reiterated that it doesn't prove that paternal drinking is more harmful to the foetal heart than maternal drinking.\n\nThe data also cannot be used to define a cut-off of alcohol consumption that might be considered safe.\n\nDr Jiabi Qin, of Xiangya School of Public Health at Central South University, said: \u2018We observed a gradually rising risk of congenital heart diseases as parental alcohol consumption increased. The relationship was not statistically significant at the lower quantities.\n\n'The underlying mechanisms connecting parental alcohol and congenital heart diseases are uncertain and warrant further research.\n\n\u2018Although our analysis has limitations - for example the type of alcohol was not recorded - it does indicate that men and women planning a family should give up alcohol.'", "description": "A study of 340,000 births in China found fathers who consumed alcohol three months before pregnancy saw a 44 per cent heightened chance compared to those who didn't.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/11/19198188-0-image-a-15_1570012680721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
