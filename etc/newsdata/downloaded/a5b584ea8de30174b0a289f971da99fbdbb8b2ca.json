Plus they have an issue in the north where their viewing is bad and they worry about a licence fee rebellion.\u201d\n\nThe insider added: \u201cIt would be nice if they could find some of their own stars and not just come poaching for ours.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC Studios/Lee Brimble)\n\n(Image: BBC Studios/Lee Brimble)\n\nThis Morning's Willoughby and The Chase's Walsh will front a festive special for the BBC in December called Take Off with Bradley and Holly.\n\nThe hour-long special will see the pair, best known as hosts of This Morning and The Chase, joining forces for a studio show in which audience members get the chance to win a trip to Lapland.\n\nMade by Holly's producer husband Dan Baldwin, it promises to be \u201cjam packed with incredible surprises, a gaggle of games and much more leading up to a spectacular end of show finale\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBut the BBC are said to have paid \u201cover the odds\u201d with a six-figure sum to lure the pair over, which didn't make financial sense. \u201cHolly and Bradley are firmly associated with ITV in the eyes of the viewers - and long may they stay that way,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cIt's cost the BBC a fortune in fees to poach them and the production costs on the show itself are around \u00a31million. Is this licence fee value? Surely not.\u201d\n\nHolly, 36, paid herself \u00a31.4 million last year, which included her \u00a3600,000 fees for This Morning. The rest of the money was earned through her work as presenter of ITV2's Celebrity Juice, as host of Dancing on Ice and as a brand ambassador for Marks and Spencer.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBradley's earnings were \u00a34.6million in 2018, thanks to hundreds of episodes of his hit ITV quiz The Chase. All his presenting work has been with ITV although he is currently filming the second series of Doctor Who for the BBC, in which he plays one of the Time Lord's regular sidekicks.\n\nMorgan was approached as a potential new host for a revival of The Weakest Link, which is not now going ahead. One insider revealed: \u201cThey couldn't agree on the money.\u201d\n\nLast night the BBC declined to comment.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: ITV chiefs think their stars are being targeted by BBC bosses for their own shows after a recent signing", "authors": ["Nicola Methven", "Image", "Wireimage", "Itv", "Bbc Studios Lee Brimble", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650892.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THIS-MORNING-30-UNFORGETTABLE-YEARS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
