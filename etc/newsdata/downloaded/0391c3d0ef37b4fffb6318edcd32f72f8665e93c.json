He learned how to trade options on WallStreetBets, a subreddit with the tagline \"Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal.\"\n\nChoi, whose Reddit username is TheTriviaTribe, returned to WallStreetBets to share the Bloomberg story in a thread titled, \"I Did It!\" He also answered several questions in the comments.\n\n\"I'm taking a small break from heavily looking at stocks, but I love them tech stocks,\" he responded to a query about what's on his watchlist. \"It's a bit weird not trading options anymore, but I'm sure I'll do it again sometime in the near future!\"\n\nOne commenter proclaimed his win was a victory for bears. Choi replied: \"I'm not bull or bear. I follow the overall market and some stocks, and decide if I'll be bear or bull for the next day to week for the overall market or a specific stock.\"\n\nThe same commenter asked whether the cash influx changed his life. \"It didn't change my life because it's not like these gains are totally life changing, but I don't have tons and tons of money, so it's not like it was nothing for me,\" Choi replied. \"I do have high goals for my future though! Career wise.\"\n\nChoi also cracked a few jokes in the comments.\n\n\"Taxes are for chumps. Haha just kidding. Of course I'll pay my taxes.\"\n\nMarkets Insider has reached out to Choi for more details about his investing.
