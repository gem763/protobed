Thursday night, Kerr was asked about human rights in China but ended up pivoting to the U.S.:\n\nSteve Kerr on if he's ever been asked about human rights during his previous trips to China: \"No. Nor has (America's) record of human rights abuses come up either\u2026 People in China didn't ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall.\" pic.twitter.com/56mNC7LmID \u2014 Sam Hustis (@SamHustis) October 11, 2019\n\nOh wow.\n\nwow good point. isolated mass shootings perpetrated by madmen is basically the same thing as government-sponsored campaigns of mass exterminations. https://t.co/23Wh08Rtt1 \u2014 \ud835\udd31\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f \ud835\udd1f\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd20\ud835\udd28\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd21\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2a\ud835\udd30 (@BecketAdams) October 11, 2019\n\nHonestly was not expecting the NBA\u2019s appetite for Chinese blood money to produce an \u201cackshually we\u2019re just as bad\u201d take https://t.co/pj20Y6dqvH \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) October 11, 2019\n\nWhat a POS https://t.co/M69rS1pzh0 \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) October 11, 2019\n\nAnd yet, there it is.\n\nIf you think gun violence in America is in any way comparable to the atrocities the Chinese government has done and continues to do\u2026 wow. What is going on here? This is a national disgrace. https://t.co/Ysr6L2AbDF \u2014 Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) October 11, 2019\n\nPutz be thy name. \u2014 Sandy (@RightGlockMom) October 11, 2019\n\nWhat an immense idiot. The Chinese communist state has murdered tens of millions of people. It has concentration camps open right now. People who shoot ARs in American malls are criminals. https://t.co/vFumkVVdlM \u2014 David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) October 11, 2019\n\nSteve Kerr comparing the right to gun ownership in America to China locking up millions of religious minorities in camps and censoring any criticism of their regime. Maybe \"shut up and coach\" might not be the worst advice for some people\u2026 https://t.co/XZCKQEQNvb \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) October 11, 2019\n\nThis was not the right answer. Not by a long shot. Wow. \u2014 Britt McHenry (@BrittMcHenry) October 11, 2019\n\nAnd here's Steve Kerr comparing China's human rights abuses (holding people in camps and silencing Hong Kong protestors) with individuals in the US that commit gun violence. This is pathetic. The NBA deserves whatever fallout they get from their cowardice. https://t.co/Hldw601jXv \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 11, 2019\n\nThis guy should stop talking if he wants people to take him seriously. https://t.co/bOW4v9KlDR \u2014 Jonah Goldberg (@JonahDispatch) October 11, 2019\n\nPolitical prisoners in China unavailable for comment. \u2014 We Need More Coolidge (@PaineInTheNeck) October 11, 2019\n\nHe really doesn't have a clue. \u2014 Wes Ganobcik \u2122 (@ganobleberries) October 11, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s the most disgusting case of equivocation I can recall hearing.\n\nWhat a cowardly man! \u2014 Stick with Freedom\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@TheMainStick) October 11, 2019\n\nSteve Kerr should, to use his own words, stick to issues he's \"well-versed on\", like kissing the ass of the Chinese government. What a tool. https://t.co/mg9LcPdn2U \u2014 BT (@back_ttys) October 11, 2019\n\n***\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018Gotta hear both sides\u2019!
