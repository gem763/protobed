During Sunday\u2019s game, Hopkins became the third-fastest receiver to reach 8,000 career yards.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nWhen asked about that accomplishment, Hopkins took pride in putting up those numbers despite a \u201ccarousel\u201d at the quarterback position.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDeAndre Hopkins got asked about hitting 8,000 receiving yards before everyone but Moss and Fitzgerald, gave an answer longer than most of his media hits: \"To be able to do that with the carousel I've had over my career, I don't like patting myself on the back, but...\" pic.twitter.com/hqNQZBylfM \u2014 Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) October 28, 2019\n\nHopkins, who is usually pretty humble, couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge he deserves credit for passing that milestone with guys like Ryan Mallett, Tom Savage and T.J. Yates throwing him the ball. Hopkins even name drops Brock Osweiler and Brandon Weeden, which draws some laughs in the press room. Though it came off as an insult, Hopkins is being sincere in thanking those players. As Hopkins notes, \u201cI can\u2019t throw the ball to myself.\u201d\n\nWhile things were rough for Hopkins early in his career, he\u2019s in a good spot now. Deshaun Watson has emerged as one of the best quarterbacks in the game, and he\u2019s just 24. Hopkins should put up plenty of numbers as long as the two continue playing together.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven in a scenario where Watson is no longer part of the equation, Hopkins would still put up ridiculous numbers. Bad quarterbacks have never stopped Hopkins in the past, and his ability to put up stats no matter the situation is why many believe Hopkins is the best receiver in the NFL.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
