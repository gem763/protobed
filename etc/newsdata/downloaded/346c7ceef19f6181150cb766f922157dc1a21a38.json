We weren't trying to achieve any particular goal \u2014 we just spent with intention on the things we value, donated generously, and saved and invested the rest.\"\n\nBut Dahleen wanted to keep working, in part to nail down a plan for what early retirement would actually look like for him, his wife, and their two young sons. He started a blog, Physician on FIRE, to track his progress. While he acknowledges his six-figure salary helped considerably, the family continued to live well below their means, saving about 50% of their income each year.\n\nIn August 2019, at age 43, Dahleen finally left work. He calls his current status \"retired not retired\" as he continues to manage his blog, which generates enough revenue to support his family and donate to charity.\n\n\"Honestly, I think giving ourselves permission to spend might be the biggest challenge. We do splurge on occasion, but for most of our lives, we've had a 'save for a rainy day' mentality,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nFor the next several months, Dahleen and his family will be traveling through Ecuador and Spain. Lodging and flights for the four-month trip \u2014 bisected by a brief stop back home \u2014 cost about $10,000 total, he said. That includes a month living on a four-bedroom yacht in Barcelona. They also have a month-long cruise booked for next year that cost less than $7,000 for the family of four.\n\n\"Even if the markets perform much worse than they have at any point in the last 100 years, we should still be OK,\" Dahleen said. \"The challenge is more of a psychological one than a true financial challenge.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It's making that transition from a scarcity mindset \u2014 which I had early on \u2014 to one of abundance. Being generous with our charitable giving and having a charitable mission with my online profits has helped in adopting that abundance mindset.\"", "description": "Leif Dahleen of Physician on FIRE says the biggest challenge of early retirement will be pulling back on his \"'save for a rainy day' mentality.\"", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8bc99c2e22af43c021ca12-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
