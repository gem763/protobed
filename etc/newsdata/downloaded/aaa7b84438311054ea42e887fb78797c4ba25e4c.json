However, with the last couple of projects bringing minimal ROI, traders are now discussing what would it take for the massive returns to come back.\n\nWhen Will Binance IEOs Pump Hard Again?\n\nInitial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) launched on Binance Launchpad created major headlines at the beginning of the year, as most of them brought massive returns for investors.\n\nDespite every single one of them being successful for the projects raising money, investors were left with a rather sour taste as the last few ones didn\u2019t come close to the returns their previous counterparts brought.\n\nTake the Perlin project, for example. Despite the seriously increased requirements in terms of holding period and the reduced number of winning tickets, the IEO brought returns in the range between 5 and 7 times. While this might seem like a lot, especially for those coming from traditional financial markets, when you calculate the decrease of BNB over the holding period, the actual returns weren\u2019t that substantial at all.\n\nAs such, traders and members of the cryptocurrency community are starting to come up with a hypothesis on when IEOs will pump again.\n\nBinance IEOs will pump hard again when: \u2013 Supply has changed hands \u2013 Binance gets their tokens released (seed, partnership/ecosystem) Very simple \u2014 Mac \u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3a (@MacnBTC) September 16, 2019\n\nMac is a cryptocurrency trader with a considerable following on Twitter and he thinks that the IEOs will pump hard only when the supply of tokens has changed hands and when Binance gets their tokens released.\n\nRecent Binance Launchpad IEOs\n\nShould This Matter, Though?\n\nWhile enjoying nice returns is definitely the purpose behind IEO investments for most of the retail investors, it\u2019s definitely not the core concept of the idea.\n\nInitial Exchange Offerings were created in order to attract interest in legitimate projects. Additionally, the main idea behind the concept is for investors to spend their money on well-researched projects which are backed by reputable exchanges. The fact that an exchange, as reliable as Binance, is putting its name behind a project is a serious endorsement and, as we can see historically, so far it has worked pretty well.\n\nHowever, more and more people (if not all) are investing in these projects solely for the returns. Hence, as the returns decrease over time, the interest could fade. This is not only bad for the projects but for the entire field because it shows that people are not really interested in actual developments but rather in solutions that could bring them quick and easy returns.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance has announced the winning tickets for the latest IEO \u2013 the Band Protocol. The trading of BAND tokens begins tomorrow and it\u2019s interesting to see how things will unfold this time.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "It goes without saying that one of the major reasons for the tremendous interest in Binance-based IEOs is the returns they bring to investors.
