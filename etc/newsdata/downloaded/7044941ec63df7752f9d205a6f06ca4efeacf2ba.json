Armed security personnel in camouflage gear were deployed to a bridge over the Seine.\n\nPeople coming out of the police headquarters, visibly upset, could be seen hugging each other for support.\n\nThe dead were three men and a woman, according to Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz. Another person was wounded and was undergoing surgery.\n\nHeitz said police were searching the attacker\u2019s home, and that anti-terrorist investigators were evaluating what had happened.
