And were they not, there isn\u2019t a thing they could do about it.\n\nThese boys must have cast-iron stomachs and audacity on tap because the aforementioned 10.5 per cent return (and the 27.95 per cent return for calendar 2019) relies on their 89.45 million iSignthis shares each being worth their September 30 closing price of 93.5\u00a2. A heroic assumption!\n\nHughes is an alumnus of Caledonia Investments (where Will Vicars and Mike Messara are balls deep in US pets Zillow, Grubhub and the Stars Group), so he\u2019s no stranger to a wild swing for the fences. Even still, how could a manager whose tagline is \u201ccapital preservation\u201d allocate nearly a quarter of its portfolio to a single stock, let alone a dicey one that now may well be a zero?\n\nOr an investment house with \u201ca strong capability in risk management with a clear aim of producing absolute returns that are uncorrelated to general market conditions\u201d? That uncorrelated bit looks true, at least \u2013 the market is up, while they\u2019ve apparently incinerated 21.75 per cent of funds under management.", "description": "How could an asset manager whose tagline is \u201ccapital preservation\u201d allocate nearly a quarter of its $440 million portfolio to a single stock?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_59%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a9f188aa7f503b8d2150f6d63f3298b0ff3d17fb", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
