Lark said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a significant number,\u201d Mr. Lark said.\n\nFuel accounts for about 35% of costs at Gol, he said. The airline, which offers domestic connections in Brazil and in other Latin American countries, spent 976.2 million Brazilian reais ($238.15 million) on fuel in the second quarter, up more than 23% from 792.7 million reais in the previous-year period.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe MAX has been a centerpiece of Gol\u2019s strategy to improve efficiency, reduce fuel costs and to expand its range of destinations. The company\u2019s operating fleet\u2014set to hit 137 by the end of the year\u2014is to consist solely of MAX planes in about 10 years\u2019 time, Mr. Lark said.\n\nGol had seven Boeing 737 MAX airplanes at the end of the second quarter, all of which have been out of service since March following a decision by regulators to ground the plane while they investigate two deadly crashes.\n\nThe airline had 129 outstanding orders for MAX jets at the end of June, including 17 that were scheduled to be delivered in the second half of this year, Mr. Lark said.\n\nThe airline has leased Boeing 737 NG aircraft to replace the grounded MAX planes, but those consume about 15% more fuel than the MAX, Gol said in its second-quarter earnings release.\n\n\u201cAll airlines using the 737 MAX have this issue,\u201d said Stephen Trent, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. \u201cThe 737 MAX burns less fuel compared to other aircraft within the same category.\u201d\n\nRyanair Holdings PLC, Europe\u2019s biggest budget airline and the region\u2019s largest 737 MAX customer, said in May that profit would be dented this year by the plane\u2019s grounding.\n\nBoeing has been working on updates to the MAX\u2019s flight-control computers and a faulty automated stall-prevention system that is blamed for the crashes that took 346 lives. The aircraft maker has said it expects the MAX to return to service early in the fourth quarter. But government and union officials have indicated that the regulatory approval process could push the plane\u2019s return into the holiday season.\n\nAirlines, Boeing suppliers and other companies have for months struggled to soften the blow of the grounding of the 737 MAX. But the lack of visibility into when the ban could be lifted is complicating that effort.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. have said they would remove the MAX from their schedules until December, while Southwest Airlines Co. and Air Canada haven\u2019t scheduled any MAX flights until next year.\n\nMr. Lark is optimistic that the MAX will be airborne this year. \u201cIs there a possibility that this thing goes longer? I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is unlikely.\u201d\n\nShould the grounding extend past November, Gol might have to change its fleet plan. It already had to adjust the route for its flights to Miami to allow for refueling in the Dominican Republic, given that the range of its replacement aircraft is lower, Mr. Lark said.\n\nGol has suspended some of the deposits it usually pays to Boeing for plane orders and expects to receive some MAX planes next year, Mr. Lark said. The company hasn\u2019t discussed potential compensation with the aircraft manufacturer yet, he said. \u201cWe will talk to them once [the grounding] is resolved,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Brazil\u2019s Gol Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes expects higher fuel costs as the continuing grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX forces the airline to rely on less efficient aircraft.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104401/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
