For us, it\u2019s about continuing the momentum and building on that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHopefully after Sunday we can think about getting down to Oita and preparing for a Sunday game against France.\n\n\u201cThey would be very tough but we have to do a job this Sunday first.\u201d\n\nThe Six Nations champions will have a number of players looking to impress their coach ahead of the knockouts, including winger Hallam Amos in what will be his World Cup debut and 22-year-old centre Owen Watkin, who steps in for Davies.\n\nEven with a patched-up backline, Wales should have too many weapons for emerging rugby nation Uruguay, who have already exceeded expectations in Japan after upsetting Pacific power Fiji.\n\nBeaten 45-10 by Australia in their previous pool game in Oita, the South Americans will hope a stronger finish against the Welsh can boost their credibility and lead to more games against tier-one nations during the next World Cup cycle.\n\n\u201cThis team has established a base in every way, from which we have to continue building,\u201d said Uruguay flanker Franco Lamanna.\n\n\u201cWe have met our expectations, but we are not satisfied and we want to improve what can be improved in the next game.\u201d", "description": "A Wales team still counting the cost of their bruising win over Fiji will look to grind through Uruguay in their final Pool D clash in Kumamoto on Sunday to secure top spot in the group and a kinder path through the knockout rounds.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439671588&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A13V-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
