Adam Schiff spent years pushing the Democrats\u2019 \u201cRussia collusion\u201d narrative, but that\u2019s now fizzled, and the California Democrat is on to a new narrative:\n\nThe Inspector General found a whistleblower complaint alleging serious misconduct to be not only credible, but urgent. Yet the Acting DNI has withheld that complaint from Congress on the basis of potential privilege. He\u2019s wrong. There's no privilege to be corrupt. pic.twitter.com/80US0rdSJv \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 20, 2019\n\nAfter years of his BS, Dan Bongino has heard enough:\n\nIt\u2019s kinda unbelievable that even after being completely humiliated, and after becoming an intergalactic laughingstock for his endless promotion of the debunked collusion hoax, that Adam Schiff decided it would be a good idea to push the \u201cwhistleblower-gate\u201d hoax. What a dope. \u2014 Dan Bongino (@dbongino) September 22, 2019\n\nOuch!\n\nWhat\u2019s Joe Biden think of all this? Do NOT ask him.\n\nThey are just desperate for anything they can use. \u2014 J Max (@j_max01) September 22, 2019\n\nWhat's next, let me guess, whistleblower comes forward that happens to be connected to the Clinton's. Big surprise. \u2014 Eric (@Eric35456149) September 22, 2019\n\nPlace your bets!", "description": "Reality check INCOMING.", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bongino.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
