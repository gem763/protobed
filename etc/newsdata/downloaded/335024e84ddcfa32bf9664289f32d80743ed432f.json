The second thing was is she's way more comfortable in her own skin being a vocal leader on our team. She's always been a good leader by how you go about your business, but her first year here she didn't want to step on toes a little bit.\n\n\"Last year she and Kristi (Toliver) shared it, but they had some help with Krystal Thomas' voice.
