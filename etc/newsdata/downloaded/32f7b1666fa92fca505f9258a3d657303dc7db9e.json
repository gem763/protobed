While viewers can see it with Republicans who don\u2019t want to be confronted with President Trump\u2019s bigotry, Hayes said, it isn\u2019t just limited to them.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the insidious destructive force of the path of least resistance is everywhere you look,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cHeck, I feel the tug of it myself as my own news organization is embroiled in a very public controversy over its conduct.\u201d\n\nThe MSNBC host said Farrow suggests in his new book, Catch & Kill, that NBC higher-ups slow-walked and killed his reporting on Weinstein\u2019s long history of alleged sexual harassment and assault to avoid Lauer\u2019s own alleged sexual misconduct coming out.\n\nAdding that the network \u201cvigorously denies\u201d those accusations, Hayes explained that while NBC News chief Noah Oppenheim has contended that the Weinstein story never aired on NBC because it lacked sufficient on-the-record sourcing, Farrow was able to quickly get it published after NBC passed on it.\n\n\u201cOne thing, though, is indisputable,\u201d Hayes declared. \u201cRonan Farrow walked out of NBC News while working on the Weinstein story and, within two months, published an incredible article at The New Yorker that not only won a Pulitzer but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of journalism that you want to do as a journalist, that everyone who works in this business should want to facilitate,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter stating that there was a reason why Weinstein was able to keep his secrets locked away for so long, the MSNBC primetime star then circled back to his initial point about the \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d causing roadblocks.\n\n\u201cTime and again the path of least resistance for those with power was not to cross Weinstein or his army of friends and lawyers,\u201d he said. \u201cSame goes for the many, many, many other powerful predators we\u2019ve come to know about.\n\n\u201cThe path of least resistance is always there,\u201d Hayes concluded. \u201cBeckoning seductively. \u2018You\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry.\u2019 \u2018This isn\u2019t the hill to die on.\u2019 \u2018The story isn\u2019t ready.\u2019 But of course, it\u2019s the very ease of that path that makes it the enemy to the kind of work we, as journalists, are supposed to do.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIn fact, the insidious force of path of least resistance is everywhere you look,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cI feel the tug of it myself.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571104845/all-chris-hayes_3_owdhep", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
