With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. That's my nightmare scenario.\"\n\nSondland, a Trump political appointee and GOP donor, texted back: \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.\"\n\nOf note: The Sondland \"tweet\" that Trump was referring to is actually a text. The New York Times reported that Sondland's response about there being \"no quid pro quo's\" came after he spoke to Trump.\n\nGo deeper: Trump administration directs Sondland not to appear for House deposition", "description": "The president appeared to take responsibility for blocking Gordon Sondland from testifying in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/7DI_iHfqhnYXDj_NN6bOQ3_6J2I=/0x428:5131x3314/1920x1080/2019/10/08/1570542185996.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
