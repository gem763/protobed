The explanation is so prevalent that such medical and public health institutions as the Mayo Clinic and American Heart Association address the \u201cno time for exercise\u201d hurdle in their outreach campaigns.\n\nBut the notion that we\u2019re too busy to work out is nonsense, according to a new study from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and conducted by researchers at the nonprofit RAND Corporation. Americans, in fact, have plenty of free time: an average of five hours of it each day, according to their analysis of the American Time Use Survey, which collects detailed time use diaries from thousands of people each year.\n\nInstead of exercising, we\u2019re giving over the bulk of our free time to mobile, PC and TV screens.\n\nActivity Average time per day, women Average time per day, men Non-leisure 18 hours, 42 minutes 18 hours, 4 minutes Screen time 2 hours, 55 minutes 3 hours, 31 minutes Other leisure 2 hours, 9 minutes 2 hours, 1 minute Exercise 14 minutes 24 minutes\n\n\u201cThere is a general perception among the public and even public health professionals that a lack of leisure time is a major reason that Americans do not get enough physical activity,\u201d said Deborah Cohen, a RAND researcher and co-author of the study, in a statement. \u201cBut we found no evidence for those beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe American Time Use Survey asks participants \u2014 a large, nationally representative sample of Americans 15 and older \u2014 to keep detailed diaries of every activity they do over a 24-hour period. For the purposes of this study, Cohen and her colleague considered \u201cleisure time\u201d to be any time spent socializing with friends, watching television, browsing the internet, participating in sports or other recreational activities, volunteering, praying or going to church, taking classes \u201cfor personal interest,\u201d and any time spent generally resting and relaxing.\n\nEverything else we do \u2014 sleeping, working, caring for family members, cooking and cleaning, going to school (toward a degree), and self care (sleeping, eating and grooming) \u2014 was not considered leisure time.\n\nWhen you add all that leisure time, you end up with more than 5 hours a day, on average, for both men and women. Just a fraction of that time \u2014 an average of 24 minutes for men, or 14 minutes for women \u2014 is devoted to physical activity.\n\nBy contrast, men and women both spent about three leisure hours a day in front of TV, computer and phone screens.\n\n[Tweens, teens and screens: The average time kids spend watching online videos has doubled in 4 years]\n\nFurther undermining the no time argument, the researchers found that many groups with lower-than-average free time \u2014 such as college graduates and people in the upper two-thirds of the income distribution \u2014 spent more time each day exercising.\n\nThe average college-educated adult man, for instance, reports having about 90 fewer minutes of daily leisure time than the average man with less than a high school diploma. But the college grad also reports spending 10 more of those minutes exercising each day relative to the guy without a GED.\n\n\u201cSubstituting at least 20 to 30 minutes [of free time] with physical activity does seem feasible and would not compromise necessary activities like work, household, family, or self-care (time in those activities is already excluded in our definition of free time),\u201d the RAND authors write.\n\nThe health benefits of regular exercise are well documented \u2014 a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes and other ailments, and improved overall well-being. Per federal guidelines, that means an adult should clock in at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity activity.\n\nIf time\u2019s not a real barrier to exercise, what is? The study doesn\u2019t dig into that question, but other explanations immediately spring to mind. After a full day of work and then several hours of cooking, cleaning and caring for kids, for instance, many working parents may simply not feel like they have the energy to add a workout to their daily schedules. Spending a few hours in front of the TV or computer after the kids go to bed may be the only activity they can muster the enthusiasm for at the end of a long day.\n\nThen there\u2019s the inevitable reality that most forms of physical activity cost not just time, but also money \u2014 gym memberships, running shoes and clothes, a bike or a treadmill for the home. Families without much in the way of financial resources may not be able to afford these amenities.\n\nLastly, the time use numbers in this report are population-level averages. Those averages obscure the wide variety of experiences seen and lived at the individual level. People working multiple jobs to keep a roof over their heads, or putting in punishing hours at one job, are not likely to have anywhere near the average amount of leisure time in a given day. And when time off does come, the first priority for people in these circumstances is likely to be rest and recuperation.\n\nThe RAND data do suggest, however, that many of us have plenty of time to add a workout routine to our schedules, if only we wanted to.", "description": "The average American has more than five hours of free time in a typical day, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Christopher Ingraham", "Reporter Covering All Things Data", "October At Am", "Christopher Ingraham Writes About All Things Data.
