HI INSTAGRAM,\u2019 Jen captioned her first ever Instagram post, showing the six actors cosied up together and smiling for the camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe combination of Jen\u2019s decision to finally join Instagram, combined with picture evidence (no matter how poor quality) of the Friends reunion that fans have been asking for literally since the show finished back in 2004, was clearly too much for the internet.\n\nAfter the photo went live, fans flocked to follow the star and like and comment on her photo in such numbers that the platform temporarily crashed.\n\nJennifer\u2019s new Instagram account racked up hundreds of thousands of followers within hours and at the time of writing, the actress has 11.4 million followers already \u2013 despite only setting her account up less than 48 hours ago.\n\nNo wonder she broke Instagram.\n\nPoking fun at the effect she had on the social media platform, Jen uploaded a second post on the platform yesterday. The clip, taken from the first episode of her new series The Morning Show, shows Jen angrily throwing her phone across a table. The actress captioned the post: \u2018I swear I didn\u2019t mean to break it\u2026 Thank you guys for the kind, glitchy welcome.\u2019\n\nJoin over 11 million other people in following the star at @jenniferaniston on Instagram.\n\nMORE: Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Instagram stories are giving us life as celebs welcome her to social media\n\nMORE: Jennifer Aniston follows Justin Theroux on Instagram after joining because they\u2019re friendly exes", "description": "Jennifer Aniston may have first appeared on our screens over 30 years ago, but she's only just joined Instagram and has had quite a welcome.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1155292762-e1571303195850_1571304904.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
