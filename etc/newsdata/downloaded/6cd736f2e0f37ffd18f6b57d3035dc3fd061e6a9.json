USA TODAY\n\nOn behalf of the 327 million American citizens who generally believe that freedom is good and authoritarian regimes are less good, let me apologize to LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIt must have been a real inconvenience to take that 13-hour chartered flight to China last week and hang around a luxury hotel in Shanghai for five days while promotional appearances got canceled. Surely it was awful to be in the middle of an international firestorm where the stakes were so high: Would preseason NBA games be played or not?\n\nAnd to think, LeBron and his teammates were so disrupted all because Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey had the temerity to send a relatively anodyne tweet supporting a protest that pretty much every one of his countrymen \u2014 whether on the left or right side of the political spectrum \u2014 would agree with over the rights Hong Kongers were promised when the United Kingdom handed control of the territory over to China in 1997.\n\nBecause as James tweeted on Monday night, trying to clarify comments he made to the media earlier in the evening: \u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nRight on, LeBron. Millions in Hong Kong are fearful that their entire way of life is about to change, and thousands upon thousands of protesters are risking their lives to make a stand for their freedom and their future. Why would Morey think about them when your preseason vacation and your bank account is at stake? How selfish of him.\n\nIf only Morey had done what you did Monday, LeBron, and tacitly admit that the only thing that really matters is your ability to sell shoes and market \"Space Jam 2\" in a country of 1.4 billion, we could have had an intellectually honest discussion about doing business in China and the cost of free speech in a country where only propaganda is tolerated.\n\nMore: LeBron says Daryl Morey 'misinformed' on China tweet, then clarifies remark\n\nJames Harden on NBA-China dispute: 'I'm staying out of it'\n\nThe problem, LeBron, is that you\u2019ve helped construct a world in which NBA players have been incentivized to criticize our leaders and our government here at home. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, by the way. It\u2019s part of who we are, and there\u2019s a large segment of people who agree with you when you call President Donald Trump \u201cu bum\u201d on Twitter and say that going to the White House as an NBA champion used to be a great honor \u201cuntil you showed up\u201d as you did on Sept. 23, 2017.\n\nU bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up! \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) September 23, 2017\n\nYou couldn\u2019t have waited a week to send that tweet, LeBron, because it\u2019s what you believed. And whatever backlash or consequences were going to come from sending that tweet for either you or the NBA, you were willing to deal with it because you presumably believed that expressing your opinion on the matter contributed to a greater good.\n\nBut when you go that hard at our own elected officials, LeBron, it is difficult to reconcile that with the idea that China of all countries should be above reproach for anyone who works in the NBA.\n\nAnd make no mistake, LeBron, that\u2019s exactly what you were suggesting on Monday when you criticized Morey for not giving any consideration to \u201cthe consequences and ramifications of the tweet\u201d while making it clear you didn\u2019t want to discuss the substance of what he was saying.\n\nLeBron James on if Daryl Morey should be reprimanded for his tweet pic.twitter.com/6hCE8vCyNn \u2014 Mark Medina (@MarkG_Medina) October 15, 2019\n\nDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, LeBron, but we really didn\u2019t need you to point that out to us. I think we all understand that when Morey hit the send button, he wasn\u2019t thinking that this would cause an international incident and potentially jeopardize billion-dollar deals.\n\nThe thing is, LeBron, we\u2019ve come to expect more of you. You\u2019re obviously an intelligent person, a compassionate person and a socially conscious person. At this point in your life and career, it\u2019s part of your brand. But to present that face to an American audience while essentially admitting that all you care about when it comes to the rest of the world is cashing those big checks \u2014 well, let\u2019s just say it doesn\u2019t look very good on you.\n\nOpinion: Terrible week for NBA may open more eyes to price of doing business in China\n\nMore: As impasse over pro-Hong Kong tweet simmers, what's at stake for the NBA in China?\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t know it, but your news conference on Monday night played right into the hands of Chinese government propaganda and undermined the values you espouse in other facets of your life and public persona.\n\nSurely you are aware of this, LeBron, but in the United States it\u2019s considered a good thing to exercise your freedom of expression in support of a just cause because you\u2019ve done that yourself on numerous occasions.\n\nNot supporting other Americans who exercise that same freedom because it might personally inconvenience you for a few days overseas, LeBron, is without question the most disgraceful moment of your career.", "description": "LeBron James' Monday news conference played right into the hands of Chinese government propaganda and undermined the values he has publicly espoused.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published A.M.
