Those days are gone. \u201cWhile each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,\u201d the statement reads. The Roundtable defines \u201cstakeholders\u201d as \u201ccustomers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.\u201d Notice who comes last.\n\nIn elevating the concerns of other stakeholders above those of shareholders, the Business Roundtable has made an unfortunate mistake\u2014one that will prove costly. No one can serve two masters.\n\nIn a modern industrial economy, commerce at scale is largely conducted through corporate entities, which shield shareholders from liability for company actions. The rise of increasingly large, operationally complex corporations allowed businesses to raise money more efficiently through capital markets and internalize components of their value and supply chains. This led, in turn, to further growth. As companies became larger and more complex, founders and owners enlisted professional managers to operate them.\n\nFinance theory has long noted the existence of the \u201cagency problem\u201d: The objectives of managers and owners are not always aligned. The agency problem is exacerbated by the problem of asymmetric information. The CEO typically knows more about what\u2019s going on in the business than shareholders do. Even the most engaged board of directors can provide only so much oversight. In recognition of these challenges, standards of corporate governance evolved toward a clear charge for managers: Maximizing shareholder value is your sole concern.\n\nThis laserlike focus on shareholder value doesn\u2019t eliminate the agency problem entirely, but it makes clear to managers that their only objective is to deliver a return for the owners of the enterprise of which they are stewards. The scorecard is relatively simple. Is the company profitable? Are its profits increasing? Is the share price going up? Are new customers being obtained on a profitable basis? If the answer to these questions is yes, everyone can rest assured that the people running the business are in sync with the people who own the business.\n\nIllustration: Barbara Kelley\n\nThe Business Roundtable must no longer see the benefit of this arrangement. In addition to \u201cgenerating long-term value for shareholders,\u201d the organization\u2019s statement offers four new objectives for corporations: delivering value to customers, investing in employees, dealing fairly and ethically with suppliers, and supporting the communities in which they work. While all are worthy objectives, they are either derivative of the objective to maximize shareholder value or a distraction from it. Either way, things aren\u2019t likely to end well for any business that opts to please stakeholders over shareholders.\n\nA management team that doesn\u2019t focus on and care for its customers, employees, suppliers and communities won\u2019t be able to sustain a profit for long. And a company that sets aside profitability and focuses only on the Roundtable\u2019s new objectives risks putting those objectives in conflict with one another. For a company in crisis, are suppliers more important than customers? Is community degradation a price worth paying for creating high-wage jobs? Companies facing these questions will be forced to make trade-offs that could ultimately cause them to go out of business.\n\nLimiting themselves to a single question\u2014Is what we do creating value for shareholders?\u2014has the benefit of clarity. When businesses add social objectives to their missions, they muddy the distinction between the private and public spheres. Individuals and companies pay taxes to governments to fund collective action on issues that are in the common interest.\n\nPeople with altruistic motives can (and should) contribute their time and resources to charity, but that is (and should be) an individual choice. To have such choices made for shareholders by agents acting at a corporate level\u2014and using investors\u2019 capital\u2014invites myriad opportunities for abuse, resource misallocation, malfeasance and inefficiency.\n\nAs a capital budgeting exercise, is a $1 million charitable contribution more wisely spent than an investment in plant and equipment? What of corporations with attractive products and profitability that hold strongly partisan notions about what it means to \u201csupport the community?\u201d JP Morgan, Nike and Gillette have all found themselves in the spotlight for charitable contributions and ad campaigns that put a seemingly greater focus on social-justice themes than either profit maximization or customer fulfillment.\n\nIn an era of high frustration with government, having private enterprise usurp public-policy functions risks further confusing society\u2019s understanding of exactly who is supposed to do what. When people look to corporations to do what government should do\u2014and vice versa\u2014everyone will end up dissatisfied with all aspects of the political economy. Perhaps these CEOs\u2019 efforts would be better dedicated to encouraging a reinvention of government, so that the tax revenue government collects from the Business Roundtable\u2019s members might be better deployed on the citizenry\u2019s behalf.\n\nPrivate enterprise, in the form of corporations, should seek to maximize shareholder value. Elevating other objectives\u2014even with shareholder value maximization primus inter pares\u2014risks failing to meet any of them. Corporations should obey the law, as should individuals. Businesses should be \u201cresponsible corporate citizens.\u201d They can even be mindful of the new objectives identified by the Business Roundtable while pursuing profits. Successful companies in the modern era have always done this. But these should be constraints, considerations and context, not the whole ballgame.\n\nMr. Shinder is a financial services executive living in New York.", "description": "When companies try to do the government\u2019s job, inefficiency and uncertainty result.", "authors": ["Richard J.
