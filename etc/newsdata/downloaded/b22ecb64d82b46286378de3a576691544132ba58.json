The surrounding mountains allow for a milder climate and for mist to reach the tea leaves, and the evaporation from the nearby Uji River contributes to keeping them moist.\n\nIn the early days, growers noticed that the yield from the surrounding forest-filled areas was a higher quality with a stronger flavour, concluding that it was due to trees naturally shading the tea plants. So, producers in Uji, following that theory, constructed wooden structures over tea bushes and placed rows of straw on top to block out the sunlight. With that shading method, matcha \u2013 specially grown green tea leaves that are ultimately ground into a fine powder \u2013 was born.", "description": "Matcha is booming across the globe, but only a select group will ever get to taste Japan\u2019s purest, ceremonial-grade form of the tea", "authors": ["Clara Hogan", "Hiromi Tanoue"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7q/dg/p07qdgqj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
