Get out! Let us see a (functioning) state,\u201d said one protester, referring to perceived cronyism and corruption in the country.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anything, just let us live,\u201d he added as puffs of smoke from tear gas rose behind him.\n\nOil-rich Iraq is OPEC\u2019s second-highest producer \u2014 but one in five people live below the poverty line and youth unemployment sits at 25 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe staggering rates of joblessness and allegations of corruption sparked the widespread protests on October 1 and the government has struggled to quell public anger by offering reform plans.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi has suggested a laundry list of measures, including hiring drives, increased pensions and a cabinet reshuffle.\n\nNew education and health ministers were approved by parliament in a session earlier this month, the only time it was able to reach quorum since protests began.\n\n\u2013 \u2018They tricked us\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut protesters seemed unimpressed.\n\n\u201cThey told young people: \u2018go home, we\u2019ll give you pensions and come up with a solution\u2019. They tricked us,\u201d said one of the rare woman protesters on Saturday, her young son at her side.\n\nAbout 60 percent of Iraq\u2019s 40-million-strong population is under the age of 25.\n\nProtesters have directed some of their anger at the country\u2019s top Shiite religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who is deeply revered among most Iraqis.\n\nOthers have been waiting for signal from influential populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has thrown his weight behind protests.\n\nOn Friday, Sistani urged protesters and security forces to show \u201crestraint\u201d, warning of \u201cchaos\u201d if violence resumed.\n\n\u201cSadr, Sistani \u2014 this is a shame,\u201d a protester in Tahrir said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe were hit! It\u2019s enough,\u201d he said, waving a tear gas canister fired earlier by security forces.\n\nRiot police had been trying to keep protesters around Tahrir from reaching the high-security Green Zone across the river, which hosts government offices including parliament.\n\nLawmakers are scheduled to meet there at 1:00 pm (1000 GMT) to \u201cdiscuss protesters\u2019 demands, cabinet\u2019s decisions and the implementation of reforms.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Mohammed al-Halbusi said he had visited Tahrir overnight, but many demonstrators have shunned the participation of mainstream politicians whom they see as trying to co-opt their movement.\n\n\u2013 Political plays \u2013\n\nThere were calls for fresh protests in the south as well despite authorities announcing curfews across several provinces on Saturday.\n\nMany expected a public outcry from the families of those killed the previous day as they prepared for their burials.\n\nLate Friday, 12 protesters died in the southern city of Diwaniyah alone while setting fire to the headquarters of the powerful Badr organisation, part of the Hashed paramilitary faction.\n\n\u201cPublic anger is directed at them in addition to governorate councils, for they were the obvious face of \u2018the regime\u2019,\u201d wrote Harith Hasan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nBut it was also a chance for Sadr to swipe at his rivals in the Hashed.\n\n\u201cThe Sadrists, especially in their traditional strongholds such as Missan, saw this an opportunity to act against competing militias,\u201d such as Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Badr, and Kataeb Hezbollah, Hasan said on Twitter.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Iraqi security forces fired tear gas to clear lingering protesters in Baghdad on Saturday morning, after dozens died in a bloody", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/de1c0f_200-people-died-thousands-wounded-in-baghdad-iraq-shiite-majority-south-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
