There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,\u201d said Dr. Barbara Sampson.\n\nSampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nEpstein\u2019s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier\u2019s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden\u2014erstwhile host of HBO\u2019s Autopsy\u2014to do his own investigation.\n\nDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn\u2019t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn\u2019t the cause of death.\n\nHe claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein\u2019s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage \u201care extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,\u201d Baden said.\n\nAlthough more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.\n\nA 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.\n\nBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city\u2019s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.\n\nThree years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn\u2019t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.\n\nIn the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\u2014he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers\u2014but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector\u2019s legal team.\n\nBaden isn\u2019t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein\u2019s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.\n\nSpencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn\u2019t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.\n\n\u201cIt all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don\u2019t believe anything they\u2019re telling us,\u201d Kuvin said. \u201cExactly what happened I can\u2019t tell you, but I certainly don\u2019t believe the story they\u2019re trying to feed everyone.\u201d\n\nSigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein\u2019s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe \u201climits what can and should be said at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is how the man should be judged.\u201d\n\nKuvin said his clients are \u201cmore interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted\u201d than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.\n\n\u201cThe justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,\u201d Kuvin told The Daily Beast. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s a failure of the Justice Department\u2026 [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.\u201d\n\nIf you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741", "description": "Dr. Michael Baden claims suicide is unlikely, but the doctor who performed the autopsy stands by her finding.", "authors": ["Tracy Connor", "Kate Briquelet", "Executive Editor", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_138/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572463052/RTR1SU21_cyvhle", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
