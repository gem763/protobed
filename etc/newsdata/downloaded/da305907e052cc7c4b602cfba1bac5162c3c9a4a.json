The region was badly hit by another powerful typhoon in September.\n\nAutomakers, including Toyota and Honda, have shut down their factories, and many supermarkets and convenience stores in the capital closed, a day after residents shopping for typhoon supplies emptied the shelves.\n\n\u2013 Rugby, F1 disrupted \u2013\n\nThe storm has also thrown two major sporting events into disarray, delaying Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and forcing the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.\n\nThe storm could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that match until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links.\n\nScotland face elimination if the game is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat \u201cdisappointing\u201d.\n\nThe storm is also causing transport chaos over a long weekend in Japan.\n\nJapanese airlines have cancelled more than 1,660 domestic flights and some 260 international flights on Saturday, NHK said.\n\nMany bullet train lines from the capital will be suspended, along with both overground and some subway lines serving the Tokyo area.\n\nThe storm will even force the first-ever all-day typhoon closure of Tokyo\u2019s Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks, with doors shut from Saturday until at least noon on Sunday.\n\nJapan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.\n\nHagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba.\n\nMore than 36,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in damaged buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Powerful Typhoon Hagibis churned towards Japan on Saturday, heading straight towards the capital with potentially record-breaking", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/f2dd3d_typhoon-hagibis-has-forced-cancellation-flights-bullet-trains-local-lines-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
