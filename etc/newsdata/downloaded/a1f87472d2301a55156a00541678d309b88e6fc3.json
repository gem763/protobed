It was fielded by pitcher Brad Peacock who threw to first, but the ball got away from Yuli Gurriel as Turner ran into his glove.\n\nMomentarily, it appeared that Turner would end up on second and Gomes on third, but umpires signaled that Turner was being called out for interference.\n\nThere was a break for almost five minutes as umpires went to their headsets and took a closer look, but interference is not reviewable.\n\nTurner could be heard yelling in the dugout about umpires should consult with Joe Torre, MLB's Chief Baseball Officer.\n\nInstead of second and third with no outs, it was a runner on first with one out.\n\nTrea Turner was called out on this play.\n\n\n\n\"That's a potentially series changing call.\" - Joe @Buckpic.twitter.com/E3Po7hSNcR \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nTrea Turner: \u201cJoe Torre is sitting right there \u2026 he\u2019s sitting with his head down trying not to look up.\u201d pic.twitter.com/BM92dbAKGN \u2014 Joon Lee (@joonlee) October 30, 2019\n\nHowever, Anthony Rendon would hit a two-run homer with two outs to extend the Nationals' lead minutes later.\n\nBetween innings, Martinez was still livid and got ejected for a confrontation with umpires.\n\nIt was the first World Series ejection since Braves manager Bobby Cox got tossed from a game in 1996.\n\nDuring the 7th inning stretch, Nationals Manager Dave Martinez was visibly upset with the umpires and was ejected during the exchange. pic.twitter.com/AZ23MusrNN \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nAfter the game, Torre spoke with Fox about the controversy and did his best to explain what had transpired.\n\n\"The call was the fact that he interfered with Gurriel trying to catch the ball \u2013 you notice the glove came off his hand,\" Torre said. \"That's when Sam Holbook called him out.\"\n\nThe Nationals wanted to play the game under protest, but protests are not permitted on judgment calls.", "description": "In a controversial call, Trea Turner was called out on fielder's interference play  at first base in top of seventh inning of Game 6.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
