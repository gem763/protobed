We didn\u2019t turn up with the right attitude and Namibia made us pay for that,\u201d said coach Steve Hansen.\n\n\u201cWe had a poor attitude. They had more intent than us and played better than us in the first half. We came out in the second half and sorted that out at half-time and came out and played well,\u201d added Hansen.\n\nThe win put the All Blacks top of Pool B after three games, with one more to come against Italy next Saturday as the quarter-finals beckon. Second-placed South Africa round off their pool matches against Canada on Tuesday.\n\nNamibia are the World Cup\u2019s undisputed whipping boys, after never winning a game in the competition and suffering embarrassing defeats like 142-0 against Australia in 2003.\n\nThe last time they beat a Tier One nation was Ireland in 1991, but they turned up to play at a cool, windswept Tokyo Stadium and were first on the board through a Damian Stevens penalty after two minutes.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s Jordie Barrett, in his first start at fly-half, put in Sevu Reece with an assured cross-field kick just three minutes later, but then missed the conversion.\n\nAnton Lienert-Brown stormed through a gap and fended off two defenders for New Zealand\u2019s second try on 20 minutes, but Barrett scuffed his conversion once again.\n\nThe All Blacks were finding it hard going against the physical Namibians, who twice worked their way up field and won a pair of penalties which Stevens knocked over to take them to only 10-9 down after half an hour.\n\nAll Blacks prop Nepo Laulala was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on Stevens, and Brodie Retallick\u2019s comeback after a dislocated shoulder lasted just 30 minutes as there were uncomfortable moments for the world champions.\n\nBut Angus Ta\u2019avao, minutes after coming on for Sam Cane, dived over for their third try and fullback Ben Smith added a bonus point fourth after the half-time gong to make it 24-9 at the break.\n\n\u2013 Scoreboard \u2018not very pretty\u2019 \u2013\n\nJoe Moody barrelled over just a minute after the restart before Barrett created a wonderful try, storming through a gap, exchanging passes with Jack Goodhue and putting Lienert-Brown over in the corner.\n\nReece grabbed his second try with a trademark injection of pace down the right flank, and captain Sam Whitelock added another as the score ballooned to 52-9 after 56 minutes.\n\nLienert-Brown\u2019s back-of-the-hand offload set up Smith\u2019s second try before Ofa Tuungafasi became New Zealand\u2019s second player in the sin-bin, again for a high tackle.\n\nBarrett rediscovered his kicking boots in the second half, nailing eight conversions and capping a fine all-round performance with a late try as he finished with a personal haul of 21 points.\n\nTJ Perenara was awarded the All Blacks\u2019 11th and final try after a lengthy review, just before the gong.\n\nThe All Blacks extend their record World Cup winning streak to 17 matches dating back to the 2007 quarter-finals \u2014 while Namibia go to 22 straight defeats, the longest losing run in the tournament\u2019s history.\n\nNamibia coach Phil Davies said he was proud of his team which has \u201ccome a long way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scoreboard is not very pretty at the end but the effort and the commitment, I\u2019m so proud of the players with how we tried to play,\u201d said Davies.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 An experimental New Zealand side recovered from a sticky start and two yellow cards to hammer Namibia 71-9 and move one step closer to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/3bb616_new-zealand-extend-winning-streak-17-experimental-all-blacks-thrash-namibia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
