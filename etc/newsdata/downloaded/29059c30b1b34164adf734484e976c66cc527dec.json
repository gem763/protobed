For close to a decade, the ECB has been cutting interest rates while urging member states that have funds for fiscal stimulus (read: Germany) to use them. The ECB grew increasingly desperate to stimulate the eurozone economy and raise inflation, and in 2015, it finally introduced its asset purchases program. It continued to urge the German government to act in order to support growth throughout the bloc, and Germany continued to refuse. From Berlin, things didn\u2019t look so bad. The ECB\u2019s easy money kept the value of the euro down, which gave a boost to German exports and the German budget, practically without Berlin having to lift a finger. Until the second half of 2018, the German economy was riding high, even as German politicians and bankers lamented the effect that the ECB\u2019s low interest rates were having on German savers and bank profits.\n\nBut now, Germany\u2019s economy is slowing. China isn\u2019t growing as quickly as before, while Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war (not to mention the threat of U.S. tariffs on European goods) have hurt business and consumer confidence. The Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, wrote in its August monthly report that the economy was likely to slip into a technical recession in the third quarter. After all this time, the ECB\u2019s dovish policies, intended to prop up struggling Southern European economies, are finally starting to make sense for the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, too. There are just two problems: First, Germany\u2019s monetary hawks, of which there are many, don\u2019t yet see things that way. Second and more important, the ECB\u2019s options for stimulus are almost entirely depleted. There\u2019s a bit more that can be done, but not without stretching the limits of European Union law and agitating the already testy Germans. If the German economy is going to get a boost, it\u2019ll need to come from within.\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\nTo Ease, or Not to Ease\n\nAt its last meeting in late July, the ECB Governing Council expressed its determination to act if inflation in the eurozone did not move closer to its 2 percent target. Investors came away expecting a further lowering of the rate charged on banks\u2019 deposits with the ECB and a resumption of asset purchases, which were wrapped up only at the end of 2018.\n\nThe Governing Council meets again on Sept. 12, but Germany\u2019s hawks are already fearing the worst and pushing back. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, in an interview last week with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, criticized the tendency to look to monetary policymakers for major responses to every blip in the data. Sabine Lautenschlaeger, a German member of the ECB\u2019s executive board, said it was too soon for a huge stimulus package. (The Dutch and Austrian central bank chiefs have voiced similar concerns.) The chief German economist at Deutsche Bank, Stefan Schneider, explained the German conservative perspective nicely, writing that \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d policymakers and economists were wrong to believe that smart policies could sustain economic expansions indefinitely. The last time a German government tried to outsmart market forces, he wrote, it ended up triggering the stagflation period of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe German monetary hawks\u2019 assessment is that the current slowdown is not yet a crisis and doesn\u2019t have to become one if policymakers just keep their wits about them. The causes of the downturn are idiosyncratic and external: the U.S.-China trade war, China\u2019s slowdown and uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU. Those factors will work themselves out, confidence will rebound and growth will resume. And if the problems are all external, the solutions can\u2019t be found internally \u2013 neither by monetary easing nor by a decision by Berlin to issue new debt. Only if the recession lingers or deepens should authorities jump into action.\n\nThe ECB, which was modeled after the Bundesbank but philosophically has resembled it less and less since the eurozone crisis began, doesn\u2019t see things the same way.\n\nBut its toolkit is nearly empty. The central bank\u2019s main refinancing rate is already at zero percent. The deposit rate has been at minus 0.4 percent since March 2016, and there\u2019s little expectation that deeper cuts would have much effect on growth. More attention has focused on the central bank\u2019s asset purchases program, particularly the 2.1 trillion-euro ($2.3 trillion) Public Sector Purchase Program, which involves buying government bonds. The ECB\u2019s self-imposed issuer limit caps its holdings of each country\u2019s debt at 33 percent to prevent the central bank from gaining a blocking minority (which would enable it to vote down future restructuring proposals) and to defend it against charges that the program amounts to monetary financing, which is banned under EU law. Reuters estimates that the ECB already holds 30 percent of German, Dutch and Finnish government debt. With this in mind, the ECB is reportedly considering raising the limit to 50 percent, which would surely spark legal challenges in Germany. Indeed, one such challenge is still working its way through the German Federal Constitutional Court. A ruling against the ECB would be unexpected, but if it were to happen, it might force the Bundesbank to cease participation in the Public Sector Purchase Program, potentially endangering the whole program.\n\nThe Fiscal Option\n\nIf monetary policy options are almost tapped out, Berlin may have no choice but to open the fiscal spigot \u2013 if, fiscally conservative policymakers caution, the recession deepens or lingers. Outside of Germany, calls for the government to do something \u2013 invest more in physical and digital infrastructure and climate protection, cut taxes, reduce barriers to investment, etc. \u2013 have reached a fever pitch. In recent months those calls have even spread inside Germany itself.\n\nThe German government started hinting at greater flexibility on spending early last month. An unnamed senior government official told Reuters in early August that Berlin may scrap its commitment to balanced budgets in order to finance a climate protection program. A high-ranking member of the Social Democratic Party, the junior partner in Germany\u2019s governing coalition, reportedly said the balanced-budget policy was untenable. The following week, officials in the chancellery and Finance Ministry told German weekly magazine Der Spiegel that Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister were prepared to set principle aside and take on new debt to stabilize the economy in a crisis. Days later, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz attached a number to the rumors: 50 billion euros, the same size, he said, as the stimulus plan Berlin put together in 2009. (In fact, it is the size of Germany\u2019s second stimulus package. Two other packages in 2008 and 2009 totaled 11 billion euros and 8.5 billion euros, respectively.)\n\nThe days when the ECB\u2019s easy money policies can prop up German exports \u2013 or the eurozone economy \u2013 seem to be coming to a close. Gradually, the German political establishment is recognizing that the country\u2019s economy needs a boost and that no salvation is likely to come from outside sources (quite the opposite \u2013 U.S. car tariffs could hit later this year), or indeed from that central bank that it loves to hate. In the short term, tax cuts, which are already in the works, and stimulus measures like the 2009 \u201ccash-for-clunkers\u201d car scrappage scheme can help. But decades of underinvestment have taken their toll. The good news for Germany is that its years of scrimping have given it significant fiscal room to maneuver. Higher levels of spending in Germany would be a relief for other European economies and would take some of the pressure off the ECB. The bad news is that not everyone agrees that action is warranted, and even among those who do, there\u2019s no consensus that German policies contributed to the slowdown in the first place.\n\nReprinted with permission from Geopolitical Futures.", "description": "It\u0092s crunch time for Germany and the European Central Bank.
