They're my little jewels!\" she said. \"I can't ride anymore. So, this way I can enjoy horses without feeling the pressure that I need to ride them.\"\n\nThe horses ease her mind, just as the marijuana buds growing in cups nearby ease something else. The pain, she said, is really bad: \"Crying kind of pain. Tears pain.\"\n\nThe pain can be unbearable, but the spirit remains unshakable, as the English-Australian superstar who just turned 71 battles breast cancer for a third time.\n\nKing asked, \"When you have a diagnosis like this, how do you stay in the moment and stay present and not let it consume you and worry you?\"\n\n\"Denial is really good!\" Newton-John laughed. \"It's really healthy! But it was consuming my day. And after a time, I went, 'You know what? I don't know what my time is, but I need to enjoy my life. So, I'm going to eat a cookie if I want it. And I'm gonna have a cup of tea if I want it. And if I wanna have a little bit of wine, I'm gonna do that.' Because the joy of life and everyday living has to be a part of that healing process as well.\"\n\nOlivia Newton-John with CBS News' Gayle King. CBS News\n\nFinding joy in life \u2013 it's not surprising for someone who brings so much of it to the world, and for so long. It's hard to remember a time when Olivia Newton-John wasn't in the spotlight. A four-time Grammy Award-winner, she's sold 100 million albums with songs like \"I Honestly Love You,\" and \"Have You Never Been Mellow.\"\n\n\"See, all this time I always thought it was, 'Have You Ever Been Mellow?'\" said King.\n\n\"I know, most people think that!\" Newton-John said.\n\nAnd the biggest hit of the 1980s? It's not from Madonna or U2 \u2026 it's from her.\n\nOh, let's get physical, physical\n\nI want to get physical\n\nLet's get into physical\n\nLet me hear your body talk, your body talk\n\nLet me hear your body talk\n\nLet's get animal, animal\n\nI want to get animal\n\n\"All those things were, like, so risqu\u00e9,\" said Newton-John. \"But now, compared to what's on the radio, it's kinda like a lullaby!\"\n\nThere's also her film career, and her role as Sandy opposite John Travolta's Danny in the 1978 blockbuster, \"Grease.\"\n\nThe musical was a game-changer for her \u2013 and yes, people still call her \"Sandy.\"\n\nKing asked, \"Is that annoying?\"\n\n\"Well, at this point, I'm thrilled they recognize me!\" she laughed.\n\nShe was 28 at the time of \"Grease.\" Fifteen years later, at age 43, Newton-John's seemingly charmed life forever changed when she felt a lump during a breast self-examination.\n\nThat was not the only devastating news that day: She was diagnosed on the same day as the death of her father. \"I had a daughter, I had a child to care about,\" she said. \"And that was my focus. You know, 'I've gotta get through this for her.'\"\n\nFollowing chemotherapy, she was declared cancer-free, until she learned it spread to her back in 2013.\n\nBut, she said it has not made her angry.\n\n\"Help me understand how you're not angry,\" asked King. \"I would think so many people would be angry and frustrated and sad \u2013 Why me?\"\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\nNewton-John said, \"Why me? has never been a part of it. But I never felt victimized. I never felt, 'Why not?' Maybe deep down I knew there was a reason or a purpose for it. Or maybe I needed to create one to make it okay for myself. Because, again, it's a decision \u2013 How am I gonna deal with it? You choose.\"\n\nThe cancer went into remission.\n\nBut two years ago, it returned again. She was told it's stage four.\n\nKing asked, \"What did the doctors say to you about your prognosis now?\"\n\n\"Prognosis? I don't discuss prognosis,\" she replied. \"Because, in my opinion, if they give you a percentage or, you know, 'This many women get this and they live this long,' you can create that and make it happen. It's almost like, I think I know what the statistics are. But I put them away. I'm gonna live longer than that. I've made that decision.\"\n\n\"Is death something that you think about?\" King asked.\n\n'Try not to. But you have to think about it. I mean, it's part of life. And, of course, if you have a cancer diagnosis, your death is kind of there. Whereas most people, we don't have a clue when we're gonna die. And I could die tomorrow \u2013 a tree could fall on me. So, it's just that we have that knowledge that we could die.\n\n\"But I try not to think about it too much, but I try to mediate and be peaceful about it, and know that everyone I love is there, so there's something to look forward to.\"\n\nNewton-John is touched by all the fans thinking of her, and moved to tears watching a message that Hugh Jackman posted on social media during a concert in Australia:\n\n\"It's so sweet,\" Newton-John said.\n\n\"It's better than people thinking, 'Is she still here?'\" said King.\n\n\"Oh, I know. It was lovely. It's so reinforcing and positive and, you know, it's lovely and just a thoughtful, really thoughtful thing to do.\"\n\nNewton-John spends most of her time at home, with her husband, John Easterlng. She calls him \"Amazon John.\" He's an advocate for the healing powers of plants, especially cannabis, like the ones he grows especially for her.\n\n\"He is the crown prince,\" she said. \"He's just a good, seriously, a good human being and a kind human being, an incredibly smart human being. And he's gorgeous to boot!\"\n\nShe's also very close to her daughter Chloe, from her first marriage. \"She says to me, she says, 'You know, mum, different people have different kinds of cancer. And my cancer was my addictions and my problems and my anorexia and things I've had.' So, she feels like she's kind of going through it with me and healing herself at the same time and facing her issues, because I'm facing mine. So, it's been a really wonderful period of growth for both of us.\"\n\nRetired from performing, she's an activist and philanthropist. She founded the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre in Melbourne.\n\nThis November, her most famous costumes will be auctioned off, with some of the proceeds going towards her center. The items include clothes from the movie \"Xanadu\"; a Pink Ladies jacket from \"Grease\"; and the unforgettable black outfit from that movie's closing number:\n\nKing said, \"I don't know how you got in them. That's what I would like to know.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, I was a pretty skinny girl! And they were the perfect fit for me, except the zip was broken, so they would stitch me into them.\"\n\n\"So, what would happen if you had to pee?\"\n\n\"They'd have to unpick it, and then sew me back in, so I would try not to drink too much.\"\n\nSkin-tight back then \u2013 but could she get into them now?\n\n\"Well, they live again!\" Newton-John laughed. \"Only you could get me to do this again!\"\n\nOlivia Newton-John wears her \"Grease\" costume. CBS News\n\nOlivia Newton-John is the only one, with the style and the smile, and so much strength.\n\n\"It's a decision how you choose to feel about something. So, I've chosen that path,\" she said. \"I'm happy. I'm lucky. I'm grateful. I have much to live for. And I intend to keep on livin' it.\"\n\n\n\nREAD A BOOK EXCERPT: \"Don't Stop Believin': A Memoir\" by Olivia Newton-John\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Gabriel Falcon.", "description": "Her pain can be unbearable, but the English-Australian superstar's spirit remains unshakable as she battles breast cancer for a third time", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/28/7bf9be20-1f12-4835-8eeb-adbc6b251cfe/thumbnail/1200x630/2e6484f07bff3d0748aabc47a06413cc/olivia-newton-john-interview-smile-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
