The stories, which Fox later retracted, cited unidentified law-enforcement sources. A lower-court judge in Manhattan dismissed the case last year.\n\nOn Friday, the appeals court based in Manhattan revived it, saying Joel and Mary Rich had adequately alleged that they suffered from \u201cwhat amounted to a campaign of emotional torture.\u201d The purpose of the stories, according to the Riches, was to take the heat off the Trump administration as investigators probed whether Russian-backed hackers had leaked the emails to advance Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy.\n\nThe suit accuses Fox News of intentionally causing severe emotional distress to the parents of the 27-year-old Rich. As of last year, the Washington, D.C., police hadn\u2019t identified any suspects in what they believe was a botched robbery, but the killing led to politically charged speculation in conservative news media that it was Rich who provided the hacked emails to WikiLeaks and that he was killed to silence him.\n\nThe appeals court found that the Riches\u2019 claims about what the stories\u2019 authors knew of the murder and the couple\u2019s \u201csusceptibility to emotional distress\u201d were sufficient for the suit to go forward. The fact that they proceeded \u201cin the face of this knowledge makes the authors\u2019 conduct plausibly extreme and outrageous,\u201d the court said.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s ruling today permits Mr. and Mrs. Rich to proceed with discovery to determine whether there is a factual basis for their claims against Fox News,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cAnd while we extend the Rich family our deepest condolences for their loss, we believe that discovery will demonstrate that Fox News did not engage in conduct that will support the Riches\u2019 claims. We will be evaluating our next legal steps.\u201d\n\nThe lower-court case is Rich v. Fox News Network LLC, 18-cv-2223, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals-court case is Rich v. Fox News Network LLC, 18-2321, U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.\n\n(Updates with excerpts from ruling.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Chris Dolmetsch in Federal Court in Manhattan at cdolmetsch@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Jeffrey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Fox News must face a lawsuit by the parents of a Democratic Party staffer whose unsolved 2016 murder touched off a flurry of right-wing conspiracy theories, a federal appeals court ruled.The parents of Seth Rich sued Fox News over \u201csham\u201d stories that ran in May 2017 claiming their son", "authors": ["Chris Dolmetsch"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JReXX_VPp2jlWlVDcqIilg--~B/aD0xNTcyO3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/a1dd476961f7bc4815e08917445399da", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
