These are all the possible reasons why", "language": "en", "text": "Got two periods in one month? These are all the possible reasons why It\u2019s not just because life is unfair.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough dealing with your period once a month \u2014 the cramps, the mood swings, the ruined underwear\u2026 But twice?\n\nAs it turns out, getting your period twice in one month isn\u2019t all that abnormal. But if you\u2019re part of that (pretty unlucky) group, know this: \u201cIrregular bleeding can have different implications depending on age, medical history, and family history,\u201d says Dr Alyssa Dweck, a gynae and author of The Complete A to Z for Your V. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to seek ob-gyn guidance if you have persistent, recurrent, or worrisome bleeding habits.\u201d\n\nSo how is it even possible to get two periods in one month?\n\n\u201cThe average cycle should occur every 21 to 35 days and last anywhere from two to seven days,\u201d explains Dr Lakeisha Richardson, a gynae based in Greenville, Mississippi. So if you\u2019re on the shorter end of that spectrum, that math could easily translate into getting your period twice in one month. And about 40 to 60 percent of women will have some irregular periods throughout their lives, she says.\n\nIf you don\u2019t just have a cycle that\u2019s on the shorter end of the spectrum, your \u201cperiod\u201d might actually be bleeding linked to a medical condition or missed birth control. And even though most of the reasons are totally benign, seeing your doctor can help identify the cause.\n\nHere\u2019s what might be going on if you\u2019re getting two periods in one month \u2014 and what to do to get your cycle back on track.\n\n1. You forgot to take your birth control.\n\nDuh, right? \u201cMissing birth control pills or forgetting your Depo-Provera shot will always cause irregular bleeding,\u201d says Dr Richardson. \u201cAnytime you fail to take a birth control method correctly, you will bleed because you have an abrupt withdrawal of hormones.\u201d This kind of bleeding, though, is not an emergency. \u201c\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nIf you resume your birth control by following the instructions, the bleeding will subside, she says. Just make sure to use a backup method of birth control to prevent pregnancy until your next period.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 Reasons Why Your Period Is So Damn Heavy Right Now\n\n2. You\u2019re pregnant.\n\nI know: Pregnancy means missed periods. But \u201cbelieve it or not, some women will bleed irregularly if they are pregnant,\u201d says Dr. Dweck. Spotting during pregnancy is very common, especially in the first trimester, and can occur for a number of reasons, including after heavy exercise or sex, or due to polyps (benign lesions that can grow inside the uterus or cervix and bleed spontaneously), says Dr Richardson. (Later on in pregnancy, spotting can occur after heavy exercise or sex or due to polyps, which are benign lesions that can grow inside the uterus or cervix and bleed spontaneously, Dr Richardson adds.)\n\nMuch more rarely, ectopic pregnancies (e.g. when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus) can also cause irregular bleeding very early on in pregnancy, says Dr Christine Masterson, chief of the women and children\u2019s service line at Summit Medical Group in New Jersey.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nObviously, a bun in the oven can be ruled out with a simple pregnancy test. Keep in mind that false negatives are relatively common if you haven\u2019t yet missed your period. If you experienced earlier-than-expected bleeding after your normal period, take the test again about a week after you\u2019d usually expect to get your period.\n\nSince ectopic pregnancies also result in a positive pregnancy test and can become an emergency if left untreated, see your doctor for an ultrasound to confirm whether the embryo has implanted in your uterus. If it is an ectopic pregnancy, you\u2019ll receive meds and potentially other treatments to prevent life-threatening complications.\n\n3. You have uterine polyps or fibroids.\n\nUterine issues like polyps or fibroids \u2014 benign lesions or tumours that can grow in the uterus\u2014are very common and may be related to hormonal issues. \u201cUterine polyps can cause bleeding in between periods,\u201d says Dr Dweck, especially if they are touched, like during sex, and \u201cfibroids can cause pain, back pain, abdominal bloating, anaemia, pain with intercourse, and spontaneous bleeding because they\u2019re not associated with the menstrual cycle,\u201d explains Dr Richardson.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nHead to your ob-gyn for an ultrasound, a uterine biopsy, or a hysteroscopy (a scope that looks into the uterus). Hormonal medications such as progestins (sometimes in the form of an IUD) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists may lessen symptoms of polyps and shrink uterine fibroids.\n\nSometimes, surgery or other medical procedures might be necessary to remove the growths. \u201cRemoval of the growths is usually curative and ensures that there are no other causes of irregular bleeding,\u201d says Dr Richardson.\n\nREAD MORE: ?What Your Period Blood Consistency Says About Your Health\n\n4. You have an infection down there.\n\nVaginal and cervical infections are incredibly annoying for a number of reasons, not least of all that they can cause bleeding outside of your period. \u201cInflammation or infection of the cervix with bacteria such as bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis can cause irregular bleeding,\u201d says Dr Richardson.\n\nMany STDs often don\u2019t cause any other symptoms, although you may experience foul-smelling or grey, white or green discharge; itching or burning in your genital area, or burning during urination.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nCheck-in with your doctor ASAP; these infections can be quickly and effectively treated, usually with antibiotics. \u201cResearch has shown that sexually transmitted disease such as trichomoniasis increases your risk of contracting HIV and other STDs,\u201d she says.\n\n5. Your thyroid isn\u2019t working properly.\n\nAn underactive or overactive thyroid gland can cause your period to come twice in one month. \u201cThe thyroid gland is regulated by hormones produced and regulated in the same area of the brain \u2014 the pituitary and hypothalamus \u2014 as the hormones that control menstruation and ovulation,\u201d explains Dweck. \u201cWhen one is off, the other might be affected.\u201d\n\nIf you have hyperthyroidism (where your thyroid produces too much of the thyroxine hormone), you may also lose weight unexpectedly, feel nervous or anxious, have a rapid heartbeat, or have trouble sleeping. Hypothyroidism (too little thyroxine hormone) can cause weight gain, constipation, fatigue, and increased sensitivity to cold, among other symptoms.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nThis is diagnosed with a blood test and typically treated with medication. Hypothyroidism drugs restore your levels to a normal level so symptoms should disappear and you start feeling better soon. Hyperthyroidism medications can clear up symptoms within a few weeks by keeping your thyroid from overproducing hormones. Most of the time this treatment permanently fixes the issue, although sometimes you may need surgery.\n\n6. You have PCOS.\n\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome is a hormone imbalance that affects between 8 and 20 percent of women, according to the National Institutes of Health. \u201cIt\u2019s a result of less frequent ovulation or the lack of ovulation, leading to an imbalance of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone,\u201d Dr Dweck explains. \u201cOne of the many symptoms includes irregular bleeding.\u201d\n\nWhile PCOS causes irregular periods, many women actually experience less frequent or skipped periods. Other commonly associated symptoms include acne, difficulty maintaining weight, hair growth in places typical to men (like the upper lip or chin), and fertility issues, she says.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nIf you think there\u2019s a chance you have PCOS, schedule an appointment with your doc to be evaluated with a pelvic exam, ultrasound and blood test. If PCOS is causing irregular bleeding, you\u2019ll likely get put on birth control pills or progesterone therapy to regulate your cycles. And since PCOS symptoms are often linked to weight gain, your practitioner may suggest lifestyle changes to help you lose weight.\n\n7. You have precancerous or cancerous cells.\n\nWhen found in either the uterus and cervix, precancerous and cancerous cells can cause irregular bleeding. \u201cSuffice it to say, a tumour growing on the cervix or uterus can bleed erratically,\u201d says Dr Dweck. One study even found that irregular periods are more likely to lead to ovarian cancer, so early detection is key.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nThese are diagnosed with an ultrasound and uterine biopsy, and a pap smear and cervix biopsies, respectively, so if you\u2019ve ruled out other causes, get to an ob-gyn STAT.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Period Symptoms That Might Signal A Serious Health Problem\n\n8. You\u2019re seriously stressed out.\n\nHigh levels of stress can cause either more frequent periods or completely missed ones, says Dr Masterson, because the hormones that trigger your ovaries to ovulate every month originate in the brain (you know, the same place where stress starts).\n\nBasically, when you\u2019re swamped at work or worrying a lot (especially if it\u2019s causing you to get less sleep), those hormones can misfire and affect your cycle in negative ways.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nIf you know you\u2019ve been mentally stretched to the limit lately, consider doing some yoga or meditation exercises, or talking to someone who can help manage your stress. You\u2019ll be surprised how much it can help your mind and body, says Dr Masterson.\n\n9. You\u2019ve been travelling recently.\n\nIf you get back from vacation and find an earlier-than-expected period welcoming you home, you might be able to blame said vacation on your irregular bleeding. Depending on how far from home you went, excessive travelling can disrupt your period.\n\n\u201cInterfering with your circadian rhythms, like changing time zones or working night shifts, can cause changes in the hormones that trigger your cycle,\u201d says Dr Masterson.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nAs long as the travel was a one-time thing, this should resolve on its own. If you work the night shift regularly, though, irregular periods might be your new normal. Aim to clock at least six hours a night, and make the most of the sleep you do get by blocking out noise and light and avoiding using screens (like your phone) right before you nod off.\n\nSince you\u2019re already feeling the effects of late nights\u2014and shift work can do harm to your health over time, increasing the risk of anxiety, depression, GI problems and even heart disease\u2014you may want to consider talking to your boss about whether it\u2019s possible to rework your schedule.\n\n10. You\u2019re in the early stages of menopause.\n\nPerimenopause, which can start as early as your mid-thirties, can cause irregular periods, including ones that are more frequent and heavier than usual, says Dr Masterson. Other symptoms to watch out for include hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and sleep problems.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nThere\u2019s not much you can do here (you\u2019ve got to let nature run its course), but there are ways to ease the overall effects of perimenopause, like medications or other therapies, if your OB has confirmed that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Hormone replacement therapy, which involves taking a pill to bump up your estrogen levels, can help ease the symptoms of perimenopause and reduce bone loss linked to menopause.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 Reasons Why Your Period Is Totally Out Of Whack\n\n11. You\u2019ve gained a lot of weight.\n\nRapid weight gain or loss and excessive amounts of exercise can also affect the hormones that stimulate ovulation, changing the typical pattern of your cycle.\n\n\u201cUsually if you are doing extreme exercise or have gotten underweight, your body turns off the ovulatory process \u2014 it thinks it\u2019s in a famine situation, and that\u2019s not a great time to have a baby,\u201d Masterson explains. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve become extremely overweight, you might see irregular bleeding happening more or less frequently than normal.\u201d\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nIf you think your weight might be to blame for your irregular periods, check-in with your doc \u2014 it\u2019s possible that there are external factors, like a medical condition or new medication, contributing to your weight gain that would be worth looking into.\n\n12. You have endometriosis\n\nEndometriosis is a condition where some of your uterine lining becomes trapped outside of your uterus. That means there\u2019s more tissue to shed every month, causing more frequent and heavier periods. Your periods may also be quite painful, and you may have other symptoms like nausea, fatigue, pain during sex, and pain with bowel movements.\n\nWhat to do about it\n\nCheck-in with your doc, who may run a few tests, such as ultrasound, pelvic exam, and possibly and MRI or biopsy. If endometriosis is to blame for your irregular periods, you might get a prescription for birth control or another hormonal therapy that can help reduce the pain and slow the growth of endometrial tissue.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "It\u2019s not just because life is unfair.", "authors": ["Ashley Mateo", "Sarah Bradley"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7683/71fdcd9a88314f65ae26e3ff51a11bd4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
