Democrats are investigating allegations that Trump used the power of his office to press a foreign government for damaging information about a top political rival.\n\nDemocrats leading the inquiry suggested they were in negotiations with Pompeo's team over the subpoena.\n\n\"Secretary Pompeo has failed to meet the deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena. However, the State Department has contacted the Committees on this matter and we hope the Department will cooperate in full promptly,\" said a committee official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe committee source lawmakers still expected to proceed with testimony for several State Department witnesses next week.\n\nPompeo's comments alleging \"harassment\" of State Department employees has sparked fury among some former Obama administration officials, who recalled Pompeo's demands when he was a Kansas congressman. Pompeo helped lead the House probe into the State Department\u2019s handling of a terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in eastern Libya where four Americans died, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.\n\nIn that congressional inquiry, Pompeo accused the Obama administration of delay and obstruction as GOP leaders asked the State Department for records related to the attack. Democrats \"have played hide the ball and have denied us records that the American people deserve and that our committee needs to complete our investigation,\" he charged in an October 2015 interview.\n\n\"No one I know believes that the secretary is acting in the interests of the rank and file\" employees at the State Department, said Brett Bruen, a former foreign service officer who worked on global engagement in the Obama administration. He noted that the Trump administration's decision to recall the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, after complaints about her from Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, has not given State Department employees confidence that he's willing to stand up for them.\n\n\"Ambassadorial appointments were rescinded for those found to have been even mildly critical of the president in their use of private social media,\" Bruen said. \"Ambassadors, like our chief of mission to Ukraine, who are seen as not falling in line with questionable demands, are sent packing.\"\n\nThe White House indicated on Friday that it would not cooperate with any document requests unless and until the full House votes to authorize the impeachment inquiry. It was not clear if Pompeo's delay was related to the White House directive or if the State Department was working with the committee to comply. The State Department press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVolker: Trump said Ukraine was full of 'terrible people' who 'tried to take me down'\n\nPompeo launched a broadside against the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry earlier this week, suggesting he would fight their request to depose five State Department employees involved in the Ukraine controversy. Democrats accused him of \"stonewalling\" the proceedings and seeking to intimidate witnesses.\n\nOn Thursday, former State Department official Kurt Volker, Trump's ex-envoy to Ukraine, testified for more than nine hours behind closed doors. He shared text messages and other information that shed new light on Trump's efforts to press Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Biden is a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.", "description": "The State Department's failure to comply with the subpoena comes amid an increasingly high-stakes standoff between the executive branch and Congress.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Christal Hayes", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gxXRXn_TyBf.mIP2tSP73w--~B/aD0yMzkyO3c9MzU4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/1d5263618c3aafdd71304c1c955ef633", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
