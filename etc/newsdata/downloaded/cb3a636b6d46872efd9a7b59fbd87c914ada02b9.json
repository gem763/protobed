The piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, alleged there was corroboration of an incident in which Kavanaugh, as a college student at Yale, exposed himself to a female classmate at a party.\n\nHowever, The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway -- who reviewed an advance copy of the book \u2013 flagged a glaring omission and the paper eventually revised the controversial story after being lampooned on social media over the gaffe.\n\nThe update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault. The newspaper also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode. As a result, some on the left and right came together and united against the paper.\n\nWASHINGTON POST SAYS IT PASSED ON NEW YORK TIMES\u2019 NOW-REVISED KAVANAUGH STORY\n\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\n\nConservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that The Times \u201chas abandoned any pretext of journalistic integrity,\u201d and the revised Kavanaugh story is the latest example.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that The Times is indistinguishable from dozens of other left-wing blogs. The White House should treat them -- The New York Times -- the same way they would Vox or Slate,\u201d Barron said.\n\nGOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called the outlet \u201cdisgraceful\u201d as a result of the story.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times left out critical evidence \u2013 all to push their own narrative,\u201d McDaniel tweeted.\n\n'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS\n\nWhile conservatives and journalism purists were outraged, liberals and never-Trumpers weren\u2019t thrilled with the Gray Lady either.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s anti-Trump host Joe Scarborough said it \u201cwas a stunning decision to leave that central fact out of an article filled with damning accusations\u201d and pondered if the revision would have occurred without Hemingway pointing out the omission.\n\n\u201cOne can argue that the failure to remember, given her intoxication, is not dispositive. One can\u2019t argue, however, that that fact didn\u2019t need to be in the Kavanaugh story from the outset,\u201d NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik tweeted.\n\nANDREW MCCABE IRKS SOME CNN COLLEAGUES: \u2018I HAVE NO SYMPATHIES FOR HIM\u2019\n\nMediaite columnist John Ziegler called The Times a \u201conce universally respected paper of record\u201d that has allowed \u201cbiased reporters\u201d to smear Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely nothing \u2018new\u2019 or legitimately credible in the piece, and there are key omissions that should humiliate The Times and, in a rational world, would never have allowed the story to run as it did,\u201d Ziegler wrote.\n\nABC News\u2019 \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Abby Huntsman even declared that the latest gaffe would help Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this place where there isn\u2019t a difference, many times, between tabloid news and a New York Times article. And that, to me, is really sad and frankly it plays right into the president\u2019s hands,\u201d Huntsman said on Monday. \u201cNew York Times, congratulations. If the president gets reelected you are helping him get there.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther critics across the political spectrum took to Twitter to bash The Times:\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re and David Montanaro contributed to this report.", "description": "The New York Times has taken heat from both sides of the aisle for walking back its now-revised allegations\u00a0against\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Sunday after swift backlash -- with even MSNBC\u2019s liberal morning show and \u201cThe View\u201d taking issue with the Gray Lady.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
