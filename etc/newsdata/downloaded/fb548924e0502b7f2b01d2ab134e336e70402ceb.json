That\u2019s a saying that\u2019s tossed around a lot for feel-good moments. In Colorado, one woman flatly rejected Bob O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to confiscate firearms, telling him to his face that she\u2019s an AR-15 owner and there was no way the government was taking it away from her. The funny thing about Bob is that he thinks his proposal will be successful because Americans would just comply. And this also circles back into the notion that liberals have zero sense of history other than saying that the Founders were evil racists whose statues should be removed and erased from the books because that\u2019s problematic.\n\nThe British tried to take our guns. That led to the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the birth of our nation. Did Americans comply when we tried to idiotically outlaw alcohol in the early 20th century? Nope. We still drank\u2026and organized crime flourished. The woman who slapped down Bob\u2019s anti-gun measure is Lauren Boebert. Hats off to you, lady (via Free Beacon):\n\nLauren Boebert, a mother of four and restaurant owner, told O'Rourke she drove down to Aurora from Rifle, Colo., to let him know she was one of the \"gun-owning Americans\" who heard his comment during last week's presidential debate about confiscating AR-15s, the most popular rifle in America. She said, \"Hell no, you're not,\" prompting the crowd to push back and say, \"Yes, he is.\" \"I would like to know how you intend to legislate evil because it is not the gun, it is the heart of the man that does that. We all have stories. Excuse me,\" Boebert said, as the crowd started to yell over her. \"Let's allow her to finish. Please, please, please, please,\" O'Rourke said. \"We all have these stories. We all have the experiences. I was living in Aurora during Columbine. I had just recently moved when the Aurora shootings happened. Yet I have very close ties here. Yet all of those people were there defenseless. They had no way to defend themselves against a crazed shooter, so I want to know how you intend to legislate the hearts of men and leave American citizens like myself, American mothers,\" Boebert said. \"I have four children. I'm 5 foot zero, one hundred pounds, cannot really defend myself with a fist.\" As people started yelling over her, O'Rourke said, \"It's okay. Please let's allow her to finish.\" It is unclear what someone said to Boebert after that, but she told the man beside her she didn't have her AR-15 with her, but informed him she was carrying a Glock. \"Well, you shouldn't have that,\" the man said. \"Don't worry, sir, I have your back,\" Boebert said.\n\nBoebert runs Shooters Grill, where the waitresses open carry as they serve you. It\u2019s as American as apple pie. Soy boys, soft liberals, anti-gun nuts can say all they want. We have a right in this country to own firearms\u2014and it\u2019s not going away because Bob will never be president. He did do well in keeping his name in the news with his gun confiscation proposal, but he\u2019s not going to win. What we need to worry about is other Democrats taking this line and running with it. We\u2019re talking about the confiscation of private property from law-abiding Americans. It\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s un-American. It\u2019s what liberals stand for now. If they don\u2019t like something, they will push an agenda that authorizes armed law enforcement to take it away from you. This is why beating the Democrats is so critical next year. We\u2019re fighting an inherently anti-American political organization. Well done, Ms. Boebert.", "description": ".09/20/2019 18:36:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/263/b9e95d94-b57a-409a-a729-6d278874c6d3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
