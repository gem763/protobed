We did some tests. And then a month later he said, \"You have the worst diet I've ever met from any patient.\"\n\n'So I went, \"Okay, out of the smoking, the drinking, and diet, what do I have to drop?\" And he said, \"The diet.\" So I said, \"I'm in!\"\n\nSlender: The star lost 20Ibs thanks to a strict vegan lifestyle, but his notably slender physique suggested he has shed even more weight as he posed for photos with Louis Walsh, Dermot O'Leary and Child of Courage winner Jaydee-Lee Dummett\n\nOld times: Simon looked fuller faced at the America's Got Talent premiere in March (L) but his weight loss was evident during his latest appearance on Monday night (R)\n\n'It was easier than I thought, and part of the reason I did it was because of Eric. I realised if I didn't sort myself out physically, I wouldn't be able to catch up with him.\n\n'Because the minute he gets up to the minute he goes to sleep ... their energy, you forget, at five years old, is phenomenal.'\n\nSimon previously said he'd named his diet the Eric Cowell diet after his son, because the youngster loves to munch on raw vegetables.\n\nHe said: 'It's like the Eric diet because he actually, apart from ice cream, he actually likes water. I mean, who likes water? And his raw vegetables. So I'm on like, the Eric Cowell diet.'\n\nFor a good cause: Simon and his X Factor co-stars supported the annual Pride of Britain event on Thursday evening\n\nMore than 100 of the UK's biggest stars came together at the Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards to honour the nation's unsung heroes on the landmark 20th anniversary of the event.\n\nThe awards recognise and celebrate ordinary people up and down the country doing extraordinary things.\n\nHost Carol Vorderman said: 'Pride of Britain is such a huge part of my life, it's hard to believe it's 20 years since we first started.\n\n'In that time, it has found a place at the heart of British life, and the winners represent the very best of us. I never fail to be humbled by them, and this year's are no different.'\n\nThe Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will be broadcast on ITV on 5th November at 8pm.", "description": "The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent star lost 20Ibs thanks to a strict vegan lifestyle, but his notably slender physique suggested he has since shed even more weight.", "authors": ["Jason Chester For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20305096-0-image-a-25_1572308010880.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
