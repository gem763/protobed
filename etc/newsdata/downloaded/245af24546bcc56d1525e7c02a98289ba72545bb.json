Typically, we see a 50% reduction in shorts before prices carve out a 6-month low. In this case, net shorts would have to drop below -170,000; the lowest we saw in October was -288,275.\n\nGOLD CHART\n\nAfter peaking in September, the pullback into the October low was very mild \u2013 not even reaching the 38% retracement level. The correction into the May 6-month low was also very gentle. Call me a contrarian, but the odds of two uncommonly shallow back-to-back corrections seem unlikely. And for that reason, I think gold may be set up to pull the rug out from under investors.\n\n[fx-image src=/2019/10/a-close-up-of-a-map-description-automatically-gen-9.png data-zoom-target=https://responsive.fxempire.com/cdn/n/n/_fxempire_/2019/10/a-close-up-of-a-map-description-automatically-gen-9.png]\n\nThe decline into October lacked readings consistent with a 6-month low, and we saw just a 15% reduction in commercial shorts from the September high. From a technical perspective, there is little supporting a sustainable low currently.\n\nExpect increased volatility surrounding Wednesday\u2019s Fed decision. A pause in the rate-cutting (perceived, or otherwise) could send gold below the October $1465 low.\n\nA decline to the 50% to 61.8% retracement level ($1381.42 \u2013 $1416.70) seems reasonable to complete the multi-week correction that began in September.\n\nOverall, I believe gold is in a new bull market, and prices are heading much higher.
