Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview Thursday. He later added: \u201cWe have an obligation to just see how deep this sewage flows.\u201d\n\nIn the past 24 hours alone, The Washington Post reported that Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor and current Trump lawyer, according to people with knowledge of the request.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Michael Pillsbury, one of Trump\u2019s China advisers, said he had received information on Hunter Biden during a visit to Beijing shortly after Trump called on China to investigate the former vice president\u2019s son. Pillsbury later offered a conflicting account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the White House on Thursday, Trump only reignited the China controversy he sparked last week when he publicly asked the Asian nation to investigate Biden. Asked whether he was joking about his request, the president didn\u2019t answer directly \u2014 but his answer suggested that he did not make the comment in jest.\n\n\u201cChina has to do whatever they want. If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don\u2019t . . . they don\u2019t have to,\u201d Trump said, adding that it would be \u201cgreat\u201d either way.\n\nIn solely focusing on Ukraine, Democrats could miss the opportunity to build a stronger case against the president \u2014 one that has the potential to sway Senate Republicans who will decide whether to convict Trump if the House votes to impeach.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically getting like three new impeachable offenses a day, so it suggests that we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg on what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Daniel Pfeiffer, a former Obama strategist who hosts \u201cPod Save America\u201d and has been pushing Democrats to expand their probes.\n\nAD\n\nMultiple senior Democratic officials tracking the impeachment inquiry said there is no plan to broaden their investigation to include Trump\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox request to Tillerson, which the former secretary of state rejected and considered illegal. Nor are Democrats readying a new impeachment probe of Trump\u2019s request last week that China dig up dirt on Biden, which one official said was a public declaration so it didn\u2019t need to be investigated.\n\nSome Democrats, however, indicated that the strategy could change.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Trump has blocked numerous administration officials from testifying, Tillerson, who was ousted by Trump, has been willing to participate in previous Democratic inquiries, even secretly answering questions for the House Foreign Affairs Committee last spring. Should Democrats call him to testify, he could be a fruitful witness.\n\nAD\n\nQuestions about next steps are expected to dominate a Friday afternoon conference call between Pelosi and members of her Democratic caucus. The discussion comes as the White House has pressured Pelosi to hold a formal House vote for an impeachment inquiry, a dare the speaker has no intention of responding to, according to senior Democrats close to the speaker \u2014 at least not now.\n\nThe Democrats spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.\n\nAD\n\nRather, Democrats are doubling down on their Ukraine probe at lightening speed, scheduling additional closed-door depositions with Trump officials, including former National Security Council official Fiona Hill, and issuing new subpoenas to Trump associates for documents.\n\nOn Thursday, they sent one compulsory measure to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who Trump said encouraged him to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Recent reports, the Democrats investigators wrote, have \u201craised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats also subpoenaed two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, for documents pertaining to how they worked to connect Trump\u2019s lawyer to Ukrainians claiming to have damaging information on the Bidens. Both men were arrested on campaign finance charges Wednesday night amid allegations that they schemed to funnel foreign money to U.S. politicians in a bid to affect U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nAD\n\nHouse Democrats have speculated that Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine was not a one-off situation \u2014 particularly after his comments to China. The New York Times also reported last week that Trump recently pushed the Australian prime minister to \u201chelp Attorney General William P. Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Mr. Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nFor now Democrats plan to use those headlines to further substantiate their call to impeach Trump, even if they don\u2019t investigate them as part of the inquiry. Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.), a deputy whip on Pelosi\u2019s leadership team, said Trump\u2019s China comments, for example, \u201ccertainly strengthens our case that this president is abusing his power in a way that is really dangerous for America.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo be sure, Pelosi\u2019s caucus appears largely behind her move to concentrate impeachment efforts on Ukraine \u2014 at least so far. Moderate Democrats sought the narrow strategy because they argue the Ukraine controversy will register with voters in their competitive districts in a way that other scandals will not.\n\nAD\n\nMany rank-and-file Democrats also fear that trying to do too much will undermine what they consider a strong case against Trump.\n\nEven some of the most liberal House members, such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, back Pelosi\u2019s Ukraine focus. In a Thursday interview, Jayapal argued that the caucus needs to \u201cstay focused on what is easiest to explain,\u201d even as she said she was open to the notion of incorporating additional elements into the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt seems like every day we\u2019re finding out a new thing,\u201d she said, noting that caucus members would discuss the scope when they returned from a two-week recess next week. \u201cThat\u2019s the conversation that will be going on and the balance we\u2019ll be striking: We want to stay focused in on a simple message, and there might be one or two places where it\u2019s actually bolstering the case of Ukraine to talk about the other situations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne factor contributing to the desire to stay focused on Ukraine is time. House Democrats hope to vote on articles of impeachment before the holidays so they can pivot back to policy matters in 2020 ahead of the election. Expanding the impeachment inquiry would no doubt complicate that timeline.\n\nBut some in the Democratic Party are questioning that logic given the damage to Trump. Since Democrats launched their inquiry in late September, Trump\u2019s support has suffered and backing for impeachment has increased. A recent Washington Post poll found that even GOP backing of ousting the president was on the rise, with 28 percent of Republicans supporting the impeachment inquiry and 18 percent say they support removing Trump from office.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the first time it feels like Democrats have been able to be truly on offense since we took the majority in 2018, and so walking away from that prematurely for the sake of an arbitrary deadline seems like a mistake to me,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cThe way this has played out the last few weeks, the way you\u2019ve seen the poll numbers move on impeachment, it\u2019s very clear that there is tremendous interest in what is happening here and it\u2019s very clear that that interest is not good for Trump.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s comments on China and other developments have caused some Democrats to wonder if they should expand their probe.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7F93XzJ4eDX5LWD56wWxI77H1sY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FT2STBHLY4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
