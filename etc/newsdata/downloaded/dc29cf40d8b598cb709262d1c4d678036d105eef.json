The complaint alleged that Trump tried to \u201csolicit interference\u201d by Ukraine when he asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine in the phone call. Trump has confirmed that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, but has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump has been criticized for withholding nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine before asking Zelensky to help investigate Biden, with some leaders in Congress saying the move was a blackmail attempt.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He said the U.S. policy with Ukraine was \u201cabout helping Ukrainians get graft out and corruption out.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed he was on the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a news conference\u2026", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mike-pompeo-ukraine-call.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
