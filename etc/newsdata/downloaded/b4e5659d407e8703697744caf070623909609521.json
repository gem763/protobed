Women are raised to be prepared to abandon their name, to put less value on it than a man - and it\u2019s not right,\u201d she concluded, adding that she wonders if in a generation\u2019s time it will be \u201cnormal for a man to take his wife\u2019s name\u201d.", "description": "Author Adele Parks has revealed that she believes there is \u201cnothing more romantic\u201d than when a man takes his wife\u2019s name, a gesture her own husband made on their three-year wedding anniversary.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/17/screen-shot-2019-10-10-at-12.21.29-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
