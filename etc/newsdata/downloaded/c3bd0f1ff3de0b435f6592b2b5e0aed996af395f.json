We are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,\" Pence said in the address at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank.\n\nProtests have been going on in Hong Kong since June.

A new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the trade dispute is set for Friday.\n\nDouglas Paal, a China expert with Washington's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Pence's speech was \"superficial and political\u201d, but Scott Kennedy from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said it seemed to be a bid to provide a rationale for \"policy moves on security, economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated.\"\n\nIn an editorial, China\u2019s Global Times said that while Pence had recycled \u201cold gripes\u201d there was also a more \u201cpositive attitude\u201d in the speech, which had been delayed from June.\n\n\u201cThe growing tensions and the escalating trade war have undermined (the) interests of the two countries,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cChina won\u2019t be overwhelmed by US\u2019 hardline policies, which has been fully proved in the past one and a half years. US political elites should recognise the fact.\u201d\n\nPence singled out Nike and the National Basketball Association for failing to stand up to China after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for the Hong Kong protests.\n\n\"Some of the NBA's biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticise this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\" he said.\n\nThe NBA had acted like a \"wholly-owned subsidiary\" of China's \"authoritarian regime\", he said.\n\n\"Far too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China\u2019s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values.\"\n\nNike, the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks.\n\nA Hong Kong protester wears a Houston Rockets jersey during a rally earlier this month.
