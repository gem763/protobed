You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has claimed that Iran are behind what he described as \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply\u201d and a clear \u201cact of war\u201d. Houthi rebels in the Yemen have claimed responsibility but Pompeo also stated that there was no evidence of their involvement. Iran, meanwhile, insist their hands are clean.\n\nRegardless, the situation in Saudi has become so perilous that air-raid sirens have been tested across the capital Riyadh in case of any further attacks on the Desert Kingdom.\n\nThe affected oil plants, however, are nearly 120 miles from the site on which Joshua will attempt to reclaim his WBO, WBA and IBF world heavyweight titles from Ruiz six months after he lost them to him in New York. As such, promoter Eddie Hearn insists they have not even considered changing their plans for the fight to go ahead in the Gulf.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nHearn said: \u201c[After the attack] We did contact our partners in Saudi and ask if everything\u2019s OK, and they said it was. As far as we\u2019re concerned it\u2019s all systems go. It\u2019s a long way from Diriyah.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect the dynamics \u2013 the financial dynamics \u2013 of the event, as long as everyone\u2019s safe and happy, the fighters and the broadcasters.\n\n\u201cRight now, unless someone came out of the government and said it\u2019s not safe... The advice is not \u2018don\u2019t go there\u2019 but the advice is to travel with caution, it\u2019s the same category as the UK, France and Mexico so there\u2019s no advice from any government to not travel to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nMatchroom\u2019s CEO Frank Smith, Hearn\u2019s long-time right-hand-man, visited Diriyah last week, just days after the attack, and was very happy with the situation at the Unesco World Heritage site which will play host for the fight.\n\nDespite suggestions that Ruiz v Joshua II would end up in Cardiff or New York, the financial incentive provided by Saudi Arabia proved too good to turn down. Hearn says they could still change the venue should the rising Gulf tension reach breaking point but he does not currently anticipate any need to do so.\n\n\u201cWe can change the venue if something major happens,\u201d he added. \u201cBut Frank Smith was on a site visit at the stadium last week with the international broadcasters, who all flew, and everyone was happy.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the one thing in terms of research is understanding the culture and what\u2019s allowed, like talking about female presenters. Everyone has questions but once everyone goes and has the meetings they\u2019re very comforted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always going to have its criticisms but the logistical meetings are 20 times more advanced than having the same meeting in London or New York. You think \u2018this is unbelievable\u2019, everything is like clockwork so you leave happy.\u201d\n\nHearn likened the situation to that of Kell Brook against Errol Spence Jr at Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane in May 2017, which took place just days after a suicide bomber killed 23 people in an attack on the Manchester Arena.\n\nThere were calls for the show in Sheffield to be pulled completely but Hearn and Matchroom decided to press on.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe had Errol Spence v Kell Brook four days after the Manchester bombing and it looked like we\u2019d have to cancel that show. We ended up having had to spend significant money on policing and anti-terror squads for the event to go ahead.\n\n\u201cThings can happen but, all systems go. If we had to change the venue, could it be done? I guess so but it\u2019s not even part of the mindset.\u201d", "description": "Anthony Joshua\u2019s\u00a0crucial world title rematch with Andy Ruiz in Diriyah is \u201call systems go\u201d\u00a0despite the recent escalation in tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
