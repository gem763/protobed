But Emsisoft said that figure is likely to be far higher.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never had ransomware, you\u2019re one of the lucky ones. Ransomware is one of the more common ways nowadays for some criminals to make money by infecting computers with malware that locks files using encryption. Once the Stop ransomware infects, it renames a user\u2019s files with one of any number of extensions, replacing .jpg and .png files with .radman , .djvu and .puma , for example. Victims can unlock their files in exchange for a ransom demand \u2014 usually a few hundred dollars in cryptocurrency.\n\nNot all ransomware is created equally. Some security experts have been able to unlock some victims\u2019 files without paying up by finding vulnerabilities in the code that powers the ransomware, allowing them in some cases to reverse the encryption and return a victim\u2019s files back to normal.\n\nStop is the latest ransomware that researchers at Emsisoft have been able to crack.\n\n\u201cThe latest known victim count is about 116,000. It\u2019s estimated that\u2019s about one-quarter of the total number of victims.\u201d\n\nEmsisoft\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a complicated decryption tool than you would normally get,\u201d said Michael Gillespie, the tools\u2019 developer and a researcher at Emsisoft. \u201cIt is a very complicated ransomware,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Stop\u2019s case, it encrypts user files with either an online key that\u2019s pulled from the attacker\u2019s server, or an offline key, which encrypts users\u2019 files when it can\u2019t communicate with the server. Gillespie said many victims have been infected with offline keys because the attackers\u2019 web infrastructure was often down or inaccessible to the infected computer.\n\nHere are how the tools work.\n\nThe ransomware attackers give each victim a \u201cmaster key,\u201d said Gillespie. That master key is combined with the first five bytes of each file that the ransomware encrypts. Some filetypes, like .png image files, share the same five bytes in every .png file. By comparing an original file with an encrypted file and applying some mathematical computations, he can decrypt not only that .png file but other .png of the same filetype.\n\nSome filetypes share the same initial five bytes. Most modern Microsoft Office documents, like .docx and .pptx , share the same five bytes as .zip files. With any before and after file, any one of these filetypes can decrypt the others.\n\nThere\u2019s a catch. The decryption tool is \u201cnot a cure-all\u201d for your infected computer, said Gillespie.\n\n\u201cThe victim has to find a good before and after of basically every format that they want to recover,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce the system is clean of the ransomware, he said victims should try to look for any files that were backed up. That could be default Windows wallpapers, or it can mean going through your email and finding an original file that you sent and matching it with the now-encrypted file.\n\nWhen the user uploads a \u201cbefore and after\u201d pair of files to the submission portal, the server will do the math and figure out if the pair of files are compatible and will spit back which extensions can be decrypted.\n\nBut there are pitfalls, said Gillespie.\n\n\u201cAny infections after the end of August 2019, unfortunately there\u2019s not much we can do unless it was encrypted with the offline key,\u201d he said. If an online key was pulled from the attacker\u2019s server, victims are out of luck. He added that files submitted to the portal have to be above 150 kilobytes in size or the decryption tools won\u2019t work, because that\u2019s how much of the file the ransomware encrypts. And some file extensions will be difficult if not impossible to recover because each file extension handles the first five bytes of the file differently.\n\n\u201cThe victim really needs to put in some effort,\u201d he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Gillespie\u2019s first rodeo. For a time, he was manually processing decryption keys for victims whose files had been encrypted with an offline key. He built a rudimentary decryption tool, the aptly named STOPDecrypter, which decrypted some victims\u2019 files. But keeping the tool up to date was a cat and mouse game he was playing with the ransomware attackers. Every time he found a workaround, the attackers would push out new encrypted file extensions in an effort to outwit him.\n\n\u201cThey were keeping me on my toes constantly,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the launch of STOPDecrypter, Gillespie has received thousands of messages from people whose systems have been encrypted by the Stop ransomware. By posting on the Bleeping Computer forums, he has been able to keep victims up to date with his findings and updates to his decryption tool.\n\nBut as some victims became more desperate to get their files back, Gillespie has faced the brunt of their frustrations.\n\n\u201cThe site\u2019s moderators were patiently responding. They\u2019ve kept the peace,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple of other volunteers on the forums have also been helping explain things to victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of community support trying to help in every little small bit,\u201d he said.\n\nGillespie said the tool will also be fed into Europol\u2019s No More Ransom Project so that future victims will be notified that a decryption tool is available.", "description": "Stop (Djvu) is said to be the most active ransomware family in use today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ransomware.jpg?w=572", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
