But not too long ago, there was another instrument that traders relied on for this: .\n\nUsed in construction to power generation to circuity of cellphones and almost every electronic device, \u201cDr. Copper\u201d\u2014as the red metal is still fondly called by some commodity veterans\u2014enables those who study it well the ability to \u201cdiagnose\u201d a slowdown way before it arrives.\n\nCopper Not Getting The Attention It Deserves\n\nCopper Daily Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nTo those analysts, sliding prices of copper have been screaming \u201cRecession!\u201d well before the yield curve inversion in and Treasurys deepened earlier this year. Only that copper hasn\u2019t got the attention it deserves, as there are more \u201cexciting\u201d metals like and to consume investors\u2019 interest these days.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s trade, copper futures posted another decisive bottom after The Institute of Supply Management flagged at a 10-year low, underscoring a continued slowdown in the goods-producing sector.\n\nBenchmark for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s Comex division slumped to a one-month low of $2.515 per lb on the ISM data. It did recover slightly before the close to settle at $2.5606, down 0.7% on the day.\n\nRed Metal\u2019s Price Could Be On The Cusp Of Another Breakdown\n\nTo Eric Scoles, metals strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, traders should not be taking their eyes off copper now as it is on the cusp of another breakdown that would point to an even more vulnerable state of the economy.\n\nSaid Scoles in a recent note:\n\n\u201cThere is a support point at $2.483. If prices break below and close under this level, a major sell off is likely.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note there is a gap on the weekly chart from 2016, and as the old-adage goes: \u2018The gap is meant to be filled\u2019. For traders this could become a significant bearish opportunity; for those who deal in physical copper this could be the time to hedge.\u201d\n\nInvesting.com\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook has a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d call on copper, projecting a downside as low as $2.469 in the near-term.\n\nEdward Meir, a veteran consultant for copper at INTL FCStone in New York, was quoted saying in the Wall Street Journal that the ISM data intensified worries about a broad U.S. economic slowdown, baked into copper prices.\n\nManufacturing Slowing Down Everywhere\n\nThe WSJ noted that other major economies have also experienced a slump in manufacturing, putting further pressure on copper, which is used to build everything from office buildings to electric vehicles.Added Meir:\n\n\u201cWhen you have every major manufacturing hub slowing down, metals consumption will suffer as a result.\u201d\n\nScoles said copper hasn\u2019t been been given its due attention lately as a foreteller of the economy:\n\n\u201cTypically, when discussing the likelihood of an oncoming recession and referencing futures markets, you will hear a whole lot about Treasurys spreads and yield curves. However, what has been standing out to me is the copper charts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Because copper represents construction, it represents industry, and its demand is strongly correlated with economic expansion and growth globally.\u201d\n\nScoles said that if the developing chart pattern indicated the potential for copper prices to fall dramatically and for an extended period, it would not be because of an explosion in production, but rather the shriveling of demand.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cIf economic expansion directly increases demand and drives the price of this commodity up, then what (will) push it down will likely be economic recession.\u201d\n\nWill A U.S.-China Trade Deal Come Quick Enough To Avert A 'Wildly Bearish' Bear Market?\n\nTo Scoles, Chinese demand was what has been driving copper in either direction, and fundamentals were supportive of a bear market in the metal unless the United States reached a trade deal with China in the near future.\n\nHe noted that the December copper futures chart indicated a market that could be stuck in a massive multi-year head-and-shoulders pattern forming between November 2016 and current day fluctuations.\n\nThat, according to him, shouldn\u2019t be ignored:", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Copper Futures, Palladium Futures.
