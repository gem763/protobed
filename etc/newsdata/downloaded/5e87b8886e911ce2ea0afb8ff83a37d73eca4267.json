Instead, government borrowing has increased during his presidency, expected to top $1 trillion for the second year running.\n\nDuring his election campaign, Trump told the Washington Post that he promised within eight years to get rid of government debt, which at the time was about $19 trillion. He told the Post he would do so by renegotiating trade deals.\n\nTwitter\n\nThe deficit is the difference in the amount spent by the government on things like defence, social security and medicare, and the amount collected via taxes and other means. The shortfall is then funded via borrowing.\n\nThe last time America's deficit had reached this level was in 2012, at $1.16 trillion, according to the Wall Street Journal. That's when America was pulling itself out of a financial crisis.\n\nThe report from the Treasury Department said there was a 7% increase in government spending, including on defense, totaling $4.1 trillion, compared to the $3.1 trillion collected in tax receipts.\n\nDuring Trump's presidency, government spending has increased massively while in 2017 the president announced wide-ranging tax cuts, limiting the amount of money brought into the government.\n\nThe debt pile is estimated to get bigger at the current spending to tax ratio rate. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan public policy organization that looks at federal budget and fiscal issues, estimates that the debt level could reach record levels by 2028, topping $2 trillion.\n\nThe deficit may not yet top $1 trillion for the full fiscal year as spending often drops in September.\n\nUS Treasury department", "description": "The US Treasury announced on Thursday that the US deficit topped $1 trillion for the first time since 2012.
