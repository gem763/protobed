There\u2019s just one catch: the new feature is only available on the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max.\n\nIt\u2019s not the biggest camera update in iOS 13.2 \u2014 that crown still goes to the new Deep Fusion \u201csweater mode\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s a long overdue one. Now \u2014 instead of having to exit the camera app, enter the settings app, navigate to the camera menu, selecting the \u201crecord video\u201d menu, and then finally select your video mode and frame rate \u2014 you just tap on the top right corner. Tapping the left side icon toggles between 4K and HD (1080p), while the right side icon allows you to toggle frame rate (either 30 or 60 fps for HD video, or 30, 60, and 24 fps for 4K).\n\nThe only real question here is why on earth Apple is limiting this incredibly useful feature to the iPhone 11 lineup \u2014 but if you\u2019re a frustrated iPhone videographer, consider this another reason to upgrade.", "description": "Apple finally has added the option to change the resolution and frame rate of video recordings in the camera app in iOS 13.2, fixing one of the single biggest annoyances about shooting video on an iPhone.
