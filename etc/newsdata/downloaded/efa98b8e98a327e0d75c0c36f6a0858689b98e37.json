Other companies are getting in the game, including HBO and NBCUniversal. Even cinema chain AMC Theatres announced its own streaming service this week.\n\n\"The fact that Netflix has shown disappointing growth without the new competition present, is a negative omen for Netflix in 2020 and beyond,\" Mr Haggstrom said.\n\nHowever, the firm's shares gained in after-hours trade, as its performance was better than had been expected.\n\n'Modest headwind'\n\nNetflix had been under a cloud since last quarter, when it revealed it had lost US streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for new subscribers overseas.\n\nThis quarter, the firm reported profit of $665m, up 65% from $403m a year earlier. Revenue rose 31% to $5.25bn from about $4bn.\n\nNetflix leaders said they remained confident of the firm's long-term prospects, noting that the firm has been competing against traditional television and firms such as Amazon and YouTube for years.\n\n\"While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalogue titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world,\" they wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n\nNew streaming services are more likely to steal audiences from traditional television, they added.\n\n\"There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth,\" Netflix said. \"In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.\"", "description": "The firm's subscriber growth is slowing, and Disney and Apple are due to launch their own streaming services.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/109CD/production/_107654086_hawke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
