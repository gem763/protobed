Prosecutors say Jean was not shot where his body was found, claiming that the victim was closer to 30 feet from Guyger when she opened fire.\n\nGuyer, who was off duty but in uniform at the time of the shooting, was later fired from the Dallas police force.\n\nOn the trial\u2019s second day, prosecutors showed the jury body camera video from Officer Michael Lee, one of the first responders on scene.\n\n\u201cI thought it was my apartment,\u201d Guyger says to Lee.\n\nThe trial began Monday with prosecutors telling the jury that on the day of the shooting Guyger exchanged sexually explicit text messages with her lover and partner, Officer Martin Rivera.\n\nIn one text she told Rivera she was \u201csuper horny today.\u201d\n\nState District Judge Tammy Kemp said the trial will resume Friday with the defense presenting its case.\n\nClick for more from FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Texas prosecutors rested their\u00a0case Thursday afternoon in the murder trial of a white Dallas police officer who fatally shot her unarmed black neighbor.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
