(Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto)\n\nA pair of elderly doctors were allegedly kicked off a United Airlines flight when an argument over boarding passes turned \u201cthreatening.\u201d\n\nJessie Au, 68, and Guil Wientjes, 66, retired pharmaceutics professors in Carlsbad, California, were booked on June 24th United flights from Washington, DC to Los Angeles. The couple had flown east to visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) to discuss a research project on harmful drug interactions and treatment for a rare form of cancer.\n\nAccording to an August 9th email sent to the United Passenger Incident Review Committee and provided to Yahoo Lifestyle by Au, the argument began when the couple switched seats with another passenger so they could sit together.\n\nHowever, when a different passenger claimed to have been assigned Wientjes\u2019 original seat, a crew member sorting out the confusion allegedly lost Wientjes\u2019s boarding pass. In her email to United, Au claims that the flight attendant said to her, \u201cGet out of that seat now\u201d with \u201ca tone one should not even use to talk to a dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation became tense and chaotic,\u201d wrote Au. Intensifying the confusion, was her husband\u2019s electronic boarding pass which contained different information than the paper version.\n\nAu says she tapped the elbow of a crew member to get her attention. \u201cAs they continued to ignore me, my husband also tapped the same person to try to get her attention,\u201d she wrote, adding that the employee kept yelling, \u201cDo not touch me.\u201d\n\nThe doctor wrote that she and her husband were told to leave the plane and when she asked why, the crew member said, \"Because you are threatening to me and threatening to her\u201d referring to another employee.\n\nAu admits that several crew members asked she and her husband to deplane, but she refused, demanding an explanation. When a voice over the loudspeaker announced that \u201ca situation\u201d was causing the entire plane to empty out, the couple left.\n\nAccording to Au\u2019s statement to United, passengers were sorry to see the couple leave and one shouted out, \u201cWe love you!\u201d\n\nAu says United re-booked their flights for the following morning but they initially were not able to board. \u201cIt was almost as if we were on a blacklist,\u201d Au tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe gate agent called a supervisor who let us board after we promise \u2018not to cause trouble.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn her complaint to United, Au said her situation was not unlike that of Dr. David Dao, a Kentucky physician who at O'Hare International Airport in 2017, was physically pulled from his assigned seat on an overbooked United Airlines flight. A viral video of crew members dragging the 69-year-old man down the aisle, bloodied with his glasses askew, forced the carrier to reinstitute policies for passenger removal.\n\nAs USA Today reports, Dao reached a settlement with the carrier for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAu tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she received an August 29th letter from United stating that she is still allowed to travel with the company. However, she\u2019s speaking out about the airline\u2019s \u201cfailed system,\u201d first sharing her story with a Forbes reporter.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson from United tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cAt United, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of professionalism. Following this issue, we reached out to our customers and our team to find out what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe airlines give crew members unchecked authority \u2014 it\u2019s their words against anyone else\u2019s,\u201d Au tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cNo one from the airline has apologized to me.\u201d\n\nAu says that because she has reached Premier Silver and Premier Gold status with the United Mileage Plus program, she will keep her upcoming flights. However, in the future, she will switch carriers.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Jessie Au and Guil Wientjes, retired pharmaceutics professors, were allegedly removed from a United Airlines flight for \"threatening\" behavior.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QBzwI.DYBsIQKD8_gICsmg--~B/aD0zMDY3O3c9NDYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/707f4150-d734-11e9-bc77-d85b76038b10", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
