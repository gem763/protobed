REUTERS/Amit Dave\n\nOn a quarterly basis, however, the CAD widened sharply from 0.7% of GDP seen in the March quarter.\n\nCAD, a key indicator of economic health, measures the difference between the values of a country\u2019s imported and exported goods and services.\n\n\u201cThough the statistics look good, it doesn\u2019t reflect any fundamental strength. CAD is capped because imports have fallen at a faster pace than exports due to weak manufacturing activity,\u201d said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Services.\n\nTrade deficit INTRD=ECI in August narrowed to $13.45 billion from $17.92 billion, trade ministry data earlier this month showed.\n\nThe country\u2019s merchandise trade gap INTRDQ=ECI widened slightly to $46.2 billion from $45.8 billion, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said.\n\nThe current account deficit INCURA=ECI stood at $14.3 billion in the June quarter versus $15.8 billion a year ago.\n\nHigher invisible receipts, including earnings through services like travel, financial, telecommunications, rose $31.9 billion versus $29.9 billion a year ago.\n\nBalance of payments INBOP=ECI, the difference between current account and capital account, stood at a surplus of $14 billion in the June quarter compared to a deficit of $11.3 billion a year ago, data showed.\n\nThe RBI said the net inflows on account of external commercial borrowings stood at $ 6.3 billion versus an outflow of $1.5 billion.\n\nPrivate transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas also rose to $19.9 billion, up 6.2% from a year ago, RBI data showed.\n\n\u201cThe Q1 capital flows may have been the high watermark given that sentiment has turned weak ever since July. For the full year we continue to expect CAD to be just below 2% of GDP and capital flows at 2.6% of GDP,\u201d said A.
