Charli XCX has brought together some of the biggest names in pop, and some names you should get to know ASAP. The British singer\u2019s third album, Charli, has 13 collaborators, including all three Haim sisters. Troye Sivan appears on two songs. Yaeji, Clairo, Big Freedia, Cupcakke, Brooke Candy, Pabllo Vittar, Lizzo, Sky Ferreira, Kim Petras, and Tommy Cash round out the (utterly fabulous) group.
