Sweden Leaves Door Open for 100-Year Bonds Amid Ongoing Review\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.

But in an interview on Wednesday, Lindblad said that may change.\n\nThe debt office needs to look into the matter \u201cvery carefully,\u201d and the upshot is that ultra-long bonds are \u201cstill in play,\u201d Lindblad said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to this.\u201d\n\nLindblad first indicated in August that his office might expand its offering to add 100-year bonds, as negative interest rates spread across large swaths of the global fixed-income market, making it cheaper to issue. For now, Sweden\u2019s longest-dated bond matures in 2039, and is yielding about 0.3%. Its other debt trades at negative rates, along with more than $13 trillion in fixed-income securities worldwide.\n\nFor Sweden, a key consideration that\u2019s shaping its future debt issuance plans is demographic developments. \u201cFrom a macro perspective, one of the most important factors why we\u2019ve seen these drops in real interest rates in the last 20 years are demographic factors,\u201d Lindblad said.\n\nAnother consideration for Sweden is liquidity. Neighboring Finland has already said that\u2019s why it isn\u2019t considering issuing 100-year bonds.\n\nSweden boasts one of the smallest debt burdens in Europe, at around 35% of gross domestic product. What\u2019s more, almost half its government bonds are currently on the balance sheet of the central bank, as a result of a quantitative easing program launched in 2015.\n\nThe liquidity question is \u201cthe obvious drawback,\u201d Lindblad said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a relatively short-term thing. I think we should approach the issue of a long bond from the macro perspective and look at the long-term savings shifts due to demographic factors.\u201d Those factors should determine whether such a bond should be deemed \u201ccheap, expensive or reasonable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, we need to look at the expected demand,\u201d he said. Given that the bond would probably be in Swedish kronor, demand is not expected to be as high as it would be for a bond in euros, Lindblad said. \u201cThat\u2019s a currency risk I don\u2019t think one should take on over 100 years.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the decision will depend on what the analysis shows, Lindblad said.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many who have done that sort of analysis,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to work through it.\u201d", "description": "Sweden Leaves Door Open for 100-Year Bonds Amid Ongoing Review", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAAA11E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
