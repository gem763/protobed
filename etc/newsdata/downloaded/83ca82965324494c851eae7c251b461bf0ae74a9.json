The stocks would have to be cheap as well. And the dividends would have to have a history of growth. Lastly, the company would have to be able to afford the dividends.\n\nIn earlier articles like this, I found stocks that met two or three of these four criteria about dividend stocks. But this time I wanted to see if there were any stocks with all four of these criteria. I feel that these four criteria help the investor know that the dividend is both relatively safe and reliably consistent. Moreover, the investor would not be paying extra for that safety and stock dividend growth.\n\nKeep in mind that the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.9%. The median price-to-earnings ratio is 14.8x and the average payout ratio is 35%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs for dividend growth rates, there are not a lot of studies. One analyst found that over 51 years, the average dividend growth rate was 5.4%. Therefore, I decided to set the minimum rate of growth at better than 5.4% over a five-year period.\n\nI also felt that I would not find stocks with better than the average payout ratio. A 35% payout ratio would be too low a hurdle with these high dividend yield stocks. So as long as the payout ratio was not worse than 70%, the stock would be deemed worthy. It would seem that at that rate the company could still afford the dividend.\n\nHere are five high yield, fast-growing dividend stocks that meet these criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: Broadcom (AVGO)\n\nBroadcom AVGO More\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 3.7%\n\n5-Year Dividend Growth: 55.1%\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: 13.6\n\nPayout Ratio: 50%\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that makes a variety of chips used in data centers, set-top boxes, telecom equipment and smartphones. Earnings have been growing consistently and have beat market expectations.\n\nBroadcom stock trades at a low 13 times price-to-earnings ratio and has a 3.7% dividend yield. AVGO pays out about half its earnings in dividends. Broadcom\u2019s dividends have been growing consistently at a high rate over the past three years (+74%) and five years (+55%). Look for AVGO stock to follow this consistent trend. Broadcom\u2019s earnings should do well over the next telecom cycle as 5G equipment begins to roll out.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber (GT)\n\nInteresting Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT) Put and Call Options More\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 3.9%\n\n5-Year Dividend Growth: 63.3%\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio: 10.7\n\nPayout Ratio: 41.2%\n\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) stock has a very nice dividend yield and growth history. Goodyear sells its own brand of tires worldwide along with private label brands. The company also has over 1,100 tire and auto-service center outlets that offer repair services and products.\n\nGoodyear\u2019s basic products are always in demand as tires need constant replacement. But it makes more money when car sales increase. Fears of an economic slowdown have kept Goodyear stock cheap. Nevertheless, given the constant demand for tires, Goodyear has the ability to withstand a slowdown in GDP growth.\n\nNew car tire sales and international tire sales make up the majority of its revenue. Volumes in new cars have been falling so its original equipment manufacturer sales volume has been dropping. Operating margins have been also hit by two new plants.\n\nThis is a cyclical stock. The long-term investor will take advantage of this situation and buy GT stock while it is cheap.", "description": "I wanted to find an ideal list of stocks with high dividend yields.
