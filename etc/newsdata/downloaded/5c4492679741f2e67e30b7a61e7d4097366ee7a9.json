Although this launch was largely anticipated, it extends AeroVironment\u2019s leadership in the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) space and Puma LE could be \u201can important new product cycle for the company,\u201d Jensen wrote.\n\nPrice Action\n\nShares of AeroVironment were up 4.41% to $59.58 at the time of publishing on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Links\n\n10 Biggest Price Target Changes For Wednesday\n\nEarnings Scheduled For September 4, 2019\n\nLatest Ratings for AVAV\n\nDate Firm Action From To Oct 2019 Upgrades Neutral Overweight May 2019 Upgrades Hold Buy Jan 2019 Initiates Coverage On Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AVAV\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
