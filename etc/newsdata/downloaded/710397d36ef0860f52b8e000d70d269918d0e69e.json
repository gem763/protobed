Probably in his last World Cup game.\n\nThat\u2019ll do.\n\nVan der Merwe, the 33-year-old Canada wing who holds his country\u2019s all-time try-scoring record, was born in South Africa. His family emigrated to Canada in 2003 when he was a teenager.\n\nTo remove any doubt, he\u2019s 100% committed to the Canadian cause, even - or maybe more so - against the Springboks in Tuesday\u2019s World Cup game in Kobe.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m Canadian now and I just want to do my best on the field for the team tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully just bring a bit of spark in the backs and hopefully lead by example.\u201d\n\nPlaying at Newlands was always on his bucket list.\n\n\u201cBut just playing against the Springboks will do,\u201d he says at Kobe Misaki Stadium on Monday.\n\nCanada isn\u2019t expected to win. Van der Merwe is still going all out. If there\u2019s one game he\u2019s been waiting on for 13 years as an international rugby player, it\u2019s this one. Van der Merwe\u2019s never played against South Africa. Canada hasn\u2019t played the Springboks since 2000. That\u2019s so far back that current Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus was on the field for the Boks.\n\nThe last time Van der Merwe got this close to the Springboks he was watching from the stands at Newlands as a kid. His family had season tickets and they\u2019d make the hour drive to Cape Town from the farming town of Worcester to watch, both Springboks games and Stormers Super Rugby games.\n\nVan der Merwe\u2019s family still have a beach house in South Africa. He took his wife and three young children back to meet his grandmother in February.\n\nHe\u2019s known about this game for a while, ever since Canada qualified for the World Cup and it became clear they\u2019d face the All Blacks and Springboks, with five World Cup titles between them, in successive games in Japan.\n\nTough as tough can be.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t something (playing both the All Blacks and Springboks in pool stage) ideal for us as a Canadian nation and team,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for me then the positive was to be in the same pool as South Africa, obviously my country of birth. For me it\u2019s going to be an exciting day, and exciting day for my family and friends back in South Africa.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s when Van der Merwe stressed he\u2019s Canadian: 100%.\n\nCanada lost to defending champion New Zealand 63-0 in its last game in Japan. But the mood is still seriously upbeat ahead of the Springboks, coach Kingsley Jones says.\n\n\u201cI judge the atmosphere (in the squad) by the volume (of noise) at breakfast and by the volume of the evening meal and by the changing room,\u201d Jones says. \u201cAnd I walked into a party this morning in the changing room. Beatbox going, guys smiling. For me that\u2019s a massive confidence booster.\u201d\n\nVan der Merwe didn\u2019t hide his love of South Africa. But before every game he marks down two causes that are more important to him.\n\nOn the strapping on his right wrist he writes the names of his wife and three children. On his left, he writes the name Capt. Trevor Greene.\n\nCapt. Greene is a rugby player who served in the Canadian armed forces in Afghanistan. He was critically injured when a boy hit him in the back of the head with an ax after he\u2019d removed his helmet out of respect while speaking to some local elders.\n\nCapt. Greene survived and recovered from his severe injuries to write a book. He visited the Canada rugby team ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. His message has stayed with Van der Merwe and other players ever since. The Canada team named their mascot after Capt. Greene. The mascot, a toy moose, goes everywhere with the team and is precious.\n\n\u201cI read his book, he\u2019s just an inspirational guy and also a family man,\u201d Van der Merwe says. \u201cHis thing was just to get back to his family, he had a little girl at that time.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s just all about family, and I wear my wife and three kids on my right hand and Captain Greene on the left, so when I need a bit of inspiration, I just look down at that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As a kid growing up in South Africa, DTH van der Merwe's dream was to play at Newlands, the historic rugby stadium in Cape Town.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
