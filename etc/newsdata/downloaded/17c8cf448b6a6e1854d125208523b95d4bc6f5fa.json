He gave us his word, but in the end he couldn\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nSpain were behind at the time of De Gea\u2019s departure thanks to Marcus Berg\u2019s goal 10 minutes earlier but substitute Rodrigo poked home from close range in stoppage time to seal the point that Spain needed to confirm their place at Euro 2020.\n\nAfter ensuring qualification for next summer\u2019s finals, Moreno said: \u201cIt is a draw but it tastes like a victory for us, and probably a defeat for Sweden.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the team\u2019s game and with the players. It was a difficult game against a rival that eliminated great teams in the World Cup. We are very happy.\n\n\u201cWhen you become a high-level team like Spain, it is an obligation to qualify. I want to remember (former manager) Luis Enrique and his family and dedicate this qualification to them also.\u201d\n\nIn June Enrique stepped down as coach of the Spanish national team after less than a year in charge to be with his terminally ill daughter.", "description": "The goalkeeper could have come off at half-time but may now miss Manchester United\u00b4s clash with Liverpool.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/wire-19763340-1571180028-413_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
