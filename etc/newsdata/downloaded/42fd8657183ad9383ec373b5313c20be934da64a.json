Worried viewers watched live footage of the balloon floating through the sky, terrified for Falcon's safety, and the National Guard was involved in trying to land it.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nRichard Heene said on Tuesday that he and his wife Mayumi (right) were innocent and that they have been treated unfairly. They maintain that they thought their son was in the balloon when it took off\n\nThen and now: Falcon is shown, left, in his father's arms in 2009 after the stunt. He appears, right, on Good Morning America on Tuesday. He is now 16\n\nFor 90 minutes in 2009, the world watched as the helium weather balloon (shown) drifted above Colorado\n\nWhen the balloon came back to ground, Falcon was not inside. He was later found in the family's attic. His parents were charged with conspiracy to commit crimes and they both pleaded guilty.\n\nHowever, they still maintain that they genuinely thought he was inside and say they only admitted guilt to stop immigration services from investigating the family and potentially revoking Mayumi's residency. She is a Japanese immigrant.\n\nRichard, who was a weatherman at the time, is still bitter about the way he thinks he was unfairly treated by the media.\n\nIn his interview with ABC, he fumed: 'This is another hit piece, which I anticipated.\n\n'What would be nice is if the media would go, \"Yeah, Richard's got a point but it's so biased, the media's got the same narrative.\n\n'I've lost many opportunities, I've had people contact me about things I've invented and the deal went south because they found out who I am.\n\n'The media never tells my side of the story.'\n\nHis mother told the show that she only ever confessed because she feared that her children would be taken from her if she didn't.\n\nWhen the balloon eventually landed, rescuers rushed to it but were stunned to open it and find it empty. There were then fears that Falcon had fallen from it somewhere\n\nFalcon, it emerged, had been hiding in his family's attic all along\n\nThe family was interviewed by CNN immediately after the incident and Falcon said: 'We did it for the TV show'\n\n'I thought I'm going to be deported then I won't see my husband or kids, I wont be able to see them,' she said.\n\nFalcon, who is now in a heavy metal band with his two brothers, said is indifferent about the incident.\n\n'I haven't thought about anything,' Falcon, he said.\n\nThe stunt unfolded on October 15, 2009.\n\nThe family had just been turned down for a reality TV show which featured them and their interest in science.\n\nRichard was working as a weather man and built what his wife later described as a 'flying saucer'.\n\nIn their initial calls to 911, they claimed that the balloon accidentally took off from their back yard, with Falcon inside.\n\nThey said they were testing it and that it was tethered down.\n\nWhat ensued was a frantic, 90-minute saga which captivated millions who watched live news coverage of the balloon drifting above Colorado.\n\nThe couple pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit a crime and avoided jail sentences\n\nThe 'flying saucer' which Falcon's parents built and released. They had already been turned down for a reality show\n\nWhen it eventually landed, rescuers frantically rushed to it to get Falcon out. Planes had been grounded beforehand to limit the chance that he would be hurt.\n\nOnce they opened the balloon and found nothing inside, fears intensified that Falcon had fallen from it.\n\nIt was only later that he was found in the family's attic.\n\nWorry for the boy quickly turned to suspicion over his parents' story. It intensified when, during a live interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Falcon confessed: 'We did it for the TV show.'\n\nLater, Richard and Mayumi were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime and other hoax-related charges. They pleaded guilty to avoid jail time and deportation of Mayumi.\n\nEarlier this month, it was revealed that Mayumi penned a diary in which she described her husband plotting the stunt.\n\nOn the first page, dated for April 27, 2009, Mayumi talked about a production company rejecting the pitch.\n\n'What could we do to help them?' Mayumi wrote. 'They wouldn\u2019t put up money, but we can do our own project\u2026. Then they can make a \"one-off\" out of it,' she added, according to 5280.com.\n\nOn September 30, Mayumi wrote: 'Richard redesigned flying saucer many times. He started 30 feet. He called around to see if it\u2019s feedable [sic], but he found it away [sic] expensive. Also he found it wouldn\u2019t fit in our back yard.'\n\nBetween October 1 and 2nd Mayumi penned that her husband made a shopping list and they recorded the intro to the project with their children.\n\nOctober 3, she wrote: 'We started building a flying saucer and shooting the process inside of the house because it was snowing.'\n\nNow, Falcon and his brothers are in a heavy metal band. They say they don't want anything to do with the hoax, but they use images of flying balloons in their music video\n\nThe brothers, who have all been home-schooled, said they did not want to be associated with the stunt\n\nAccording to 5280.com, on one of the notes, Mayumi said they have video of Falcon saying: 'I want to get inside of it.'\n\nIn a note dated for October 14, Mayumi claims that Richard 'asked me to remember about the story of \"Lawnchair Larry,\" then Richard mentioned what if Falcon hid for \u00bd hours later and landed, then mention in [news]paper, Fort Collins\u2026. Falcon can hide in the closet with a safe in the basement'.\n\nOn October 15, the day of the incident, Mayumi wrote that she didn't believe they were going to launch the flying saucer because of the 'strong wind'.\n\n'Because of the wind, it might crash on somebody, cars or anything\u2026. Richard said we would do the third test and quit. That\u2019s why I thought he was acting so strange. After the flying saucer went off, he went so hysterical. Because he started so hysterical, I started taking it seriously. After it was launched, we did not know whether Falcon was in the flying saucer or in the house or anywhere,' she wrote.\n\nThree days later on October 18, Mayumi said she 'found out when we visited our attorney\u2019s [sic] that Richard revealed he came down to the basement to look for Falcon, but he wasn\u2019t there.\n\n'Richard thought really Falcon would be in the flying saucer.'\n\nBut once the diary was discovered and presented to the couple, Mayumi denied that it was true.\n\n'I made the whole story up,' she told the site.\n\n'What?' Richard asked before Mayumi explained that she wrote it.\n\n'What do you mean you wrote this?' Richard said, according to 5280.com. 'What the f**k are you talking about? You said you didn\u2019t know what this was. Why would you write this?'\n\nMayumi answered: 'To save myself, because of our kids.'", "description": "Falcon Heene, now 16, was interviewed by Good Morning America along with his parents, Richard and Mayumi, to commemorate the ten year anniversary of the bizarre stunt.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20328210-0-image-a-5_1572357271366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
