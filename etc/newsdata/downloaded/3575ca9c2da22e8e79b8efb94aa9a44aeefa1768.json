Save the Children said Wednesday that fuel shortages have resulted in a jump in food prices and, as a result, a deepening health crisis. The group says fuel prices have hiked 100% over the past 40 days as the internationally recognized government imposed customs duties in the interim capital Aden. That caused a 60% decrease in the amount of fuel coming through the key port of Hodeida, the group says.\n\nHigher fuel prices not only raise the cost of food in a country devastated by war and wracked by famine, and they also contribute to the health crisis by affecting how much fuel people can use to power generators and water pumps. Without fuel to run water pumps and water trucks to bring fresh water, Yemeni civilians cannot get clean drinking water and risk contracting cholera or other waterborne diseases. At least 18 million people in Yemen lack access to clean water, and that is a result of repeated attacks on Yemen\u2019s infrastructure, including water systems and sewage treatment plants. As the report notes, more than 620,000 cases of cholera have already been identified so far this year. There will likely be hundreds of thousands more by the end of the year. Save the Children explained in their statement that the government\u2019s requirement to pay the duty in Aden has caused both delays in delivering goods and an increase in their cost:\n\n\u201cBetween August and September, there was a 60 percent1 decrease in the amount of fuel coming through Hodeidah port\u2014this is because of a decree by the government of Yemen requiring customs duties to be paid in Aden before allowing ships to discharge in Hodeidah\u2014of course this means double customs duty. The price of fuel has increased by 100 percent over the past 40 days, which made the transport of lifesaving goods to communities in need 30 percent more expensive. Transportation which previously took one day is now taking three days as trucks have to wait for fuel, resulting in huge delays in getting food and medicines to communities. \u201cWe ask the international community to work with the government of Yemen to waiver this decree immediately so that this unfolding crisis can be averted. It is vital that there is free, unhindered access for humanitarian and commercial goods, including fuel, into and across the country as this is a lifeline for many families.\u201d\n\nThe fuel shortage further compounds the health crisis in Yemen by attacking public sanitation. A lack of fuel means that sanitation workers can\u2019t remove trash, and so it piles up in the streets of the capital and contributes to the spread of disease:\n\nIn Yemen\u2019s capital Sanaa health officials warn that enormous piles of uncollected rubbish littering its streets could lead to another cholera outbreak. But rubbish trucks have not been able to do their rounds because of a severe fuel shortage, despite last year\u2019s Sweden deal which promised the delivery of goods and other services if the Houthis gave up control of the port of Hodeidah.\n\nOnce again, a decision by the Hadi government has imposed greater hardship on the people of Yemen when they are already in the midst of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. This is the same government that the U.S. supports and has been trying to force back into power. The longer the war drags on, the worse Yemen\u2019s humanitarian crisis gets. The administration\u2019s continued support for the Saudi coalition and the Hadi government makes the U.S. complicit in this unfolding catastrophe.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/yemeni-child.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
