Frederik Andersen stopped 42 shots.\n\nDavid Pastrnak had a goal and an assist, and Jake DeBrusk and Danton Heinen also scored for the Bruins. Jaroslav Halak finished with 25 saves.\n\nRielly\u2019s winner came after Marner took a feed from Auston Matthews and ripped a shot that deflected off Rielly\u2019s shin past Halak\u2019s blocker with the teams playing 3-on-3 in the extra period.\n\nDown 2-1 despite a dominating second, the Bruins tied the score at 1:36 of the third just as a Leafs\u2019 penalty was about to expire when Heinen wired his first upstairs on Andersen.\n\nToronto replied just 61 seconds later when Kerfoot backhanded a loose puck past Halak for his third of the season.\n\nAndersen faced 33 shots through two periods, and the Boston kept coming late in the third, with Pastrnak tying things with 4:26 left in regulation when he blasted a one-timer for his ninth.\n\nPastrnak now has nine goals on the season, including seven in the last three games, which puts him in a tie with Edmonton\u2019s James Neal for the NHL lead.\n\nThe Maple Leafs played their first game without captain and star center John Tavares, who broke a finger Wednesday and will miss at least two weeks. The Bruins, meanwhile, were minus veteran center David Krejci (upper-body injury) for a third straight game.\n\nToronto has lost to Boston to open the playoffs each of the last two years - with both series going to a Game 7 - but with Tavares, Zach Hyman (knee) and Travis Dermott (shoulder) all out injured, and some major roster restructuring in the off-season, just nine of the 18 skaters who dressed for the Maple Leafs in the deciding game back on April 23 were in Saturday\u2019s lineup.\n\nThe Bruins, who went onto make the Stanley Cup Final before losing on home ice in Game 7 against the St. Louis Blues, dressed 13 skaters from that 5-1 victory against Toronto.\n\nThe Maple Leafs opened the scoring at 5:55 of a spirited first period when Rielly\u2019s point shot with Johnsson battling in front went in off Bruins defenseman Brandon Carlo and in for his first of the season.\n\nDeBrusk came close to tying the game a few minutes later when he blew past Tyson Barrie, but Andersen made a nice toe save.\n\nTimashov made it 2-0 on a good fourth-line shift from Toronto. The rookie forward got the puck from Frederik Gauthier and moved into the slot before roofing his first NHL goal past Halak.\n\nThe Bruins, who had 18 shots in the first, finally got on the board with 20.6 seconds left in the period when DeBrusk took advantage of some poor defending to beat Andersen from in-close.\n\nComing off Thursday\u2019s 4-3 shootout loss at home to Tampa Bay, Boston fed off that goal in the second and had Toronto on its heels for long stretches.\n\nThe Maple Leafs\u2019 best chance of the second came after Sean Kuraly threw the puck in front of his own net, but Barrie was robbed by Halak with the glove.\n\nNOTES: Halak, who has shared the Boston crease with Tuukka Rask to start the season, made his fourth start. \u2026 U.S. Open and Rogers Cup champion Bianca Andreescu of Mississauga, Ontario, dropped the puck for the ceremonial faceoff. \u2026 Attendance was 19,394. \u2026 Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock threw an early curveball with Tavares out after going through Friday\u2019s practice and Saturday\u2019s warmup with Matthews centering William Nylander and Andreas Johnsson, and Alexander Kerfoot between Marner and Ilya Mikheyev. Babcock instead started with Matthews-Marner-Johnsson and Kerfoot-Nylander-Mikheyev, and tinkered with his top-6 at times throughout the night.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBruins: Host Toronto on Tuesday night.\n\nMaple Leafs: Host Columbus on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Morgan Rielly's second goal of the game, on a deflection of Mitch Marner's shot, at 3:54 of overtime gave the Toronto Maple Leafs a 4-3 win over the Boston Bruins on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/bruins_maple_leafs_hockey_12062_c0-280-3000-2030_s1200x700.jpg?3482d5cd026fe666a35d21fd4c021903176e58ab", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
