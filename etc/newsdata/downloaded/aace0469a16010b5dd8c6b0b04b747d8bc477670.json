In recent weeks, even close Corbyn ally John McDonnell indicated he was ready to consider the referendum-first option.\n\nIn a key change of stance, Mr Corbyn resisted repeated efforts by the prime minister to trigger an election under fixed-term parliaments legislation, arguing that it should not go ahead so long as no-deal Brexit remained a risk.\n\nHe stuck by this position as late as the shadow cabinet meeting on Monday, when a Halloween crash-out was taken off the table by the EU\u2019s offer to delay Brexit to 31 January.\n\nBut last weekend\u2019s decision by Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party to back a one-line bill for a December poll shifted the political calculations.\n\nKnowing that their support could deliver the election Mr Johnson wanted, Labour risked being isolated as the one major party holding out against a vote for the public, vulnerable to inevitable taunts from Tories that it was frightened of their verdict.\n\nMr Corbyn told Tuesday\u2019s meeting that Labour\u2019s condition had now been met and the party would \u201claunch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen\u201d.\n\nThere was immediate dissent from within Labour ranks, with veteran MP Barry Sheerman even predicting frontbench resignations.\n\nMr Sheerman said it was \u201csheer madness to hold a general election in December and on Boris Johnson\u2019s agenda\u201d.\n\nAnd he added: \u201cA clear majority of our shadow cabinet were against a December election yesterday but Jeremy Corbyn has been persuaded to override them after interventions from Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy.\u201d\n\nPaul Farrelly told the Commons that he would vote against an early election, as he did not believe no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table.\n\nAlthough supporting his party\u2019s decision, mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested a new referendum was still the most important next step in the Brexit process.\n\n\u201cBut if there is to be a general election first, then those whose future is most affected must be given a say \u2013 including 16- and 17-year-olds and EU citizens living in the UK,\u201d he added.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s announcement that Labour was backing a December general election sparked a furious war within the parliamentary party, with one MP branding it \u201csheer madness\u201d while frontbenchers sent out messages declaring, \u201cBring it on\u201d.
