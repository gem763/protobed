Tlaib made some straight-up bananas comments during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, including asking Vicki Porter (who, as Reason\u2019s Robby Soave notes, was the only pro-vaping witness at the hearing) whether or not she was a \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201d\n\nTlaib asked:\n\n\u201cMs. Porter, I was reading because I want to know more about you and your beliefs, and I respect that we all have different beliefs, but you call yourself a converted conservative and a reformed Marxist? Are you a conspiracy theorist?\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Juul CEO Steps Down Amid Vaping Crisis\n\nPorter responded:\n\n\u201cI think my politics are entirely irrelevant to this hearing.\u201d\n\nPorter is, of course, absolutely correct in this sentiment \u2014 but more on that later. First, I\u2019ve got to highlight the rest of the drivel that Tlaib spewed during her joke of an interview.\n\nFor example: Because she apparently didn\u2019t think she\u2019d come off nuts enough the first time, Tlaib doubled-down on the \u201cconspiracy\u201d allegation again later. Porter had winked at Representative Glenn Grothman, and Tlaib interrogated her as to why she had done so. Porter gave a reasonable answer (\u201cBecause I know Glenn Grothman\u201d) and Tlaib said \u2014 and I\u2019m not kidding \u2014 \u201cI thought maybe there was like a conspiracy thing going on.\u201d\n\nWhat?\n\nBut the stupid doesn\u2019t end there. No, elsewhere in the interview, Tlaib literally said that secondhand smoke was \u201cworse than directly smoking cigarettes.\u201d\n\nAgain: What? Now, not only is that obviously not true, I am also having a hard time understanding how anyone could ever (ever!) even possibly think that it were. I mean, if that were the case, doctors would be advising children in households with parents who smoke to just start lighting up themselves, because puffing on cigs directly would at least be better for their health than just breathing it secondhand.\n\nOh, and Tlaib also seemed to suggest that vaping is just as harmful as smoking in the following exchange:\n\nPorter: \u201cThe truth for me is that I quit smoking with e-cigarettes and so did eight million other people.\u201d Tlaib: \u201cYou\u2019re still smoking, ma\u2019am. You\u2019re still smoking.\u201d\n\nHey, Tlaib? No, she\u2019s not, and suggesting that she is is just as ridiculous as claiming that secondhand smoke is worse than smoking. Although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not good for you, the expert consensus is that it is, at least, better. A study conducted by (known den of conspiracy theorists) Harvard found that vaping is \u201calmost certainly less lethal than conventional cigarettes,\u201d and a Public Health England study found that it is 95 percent less harmful. (For more information on the actual facts on vaping safety, click here.)\n\nSo, why did Tlaib make such bizarre statements? Honestly, there are only two options: Either she was purposely making false statements, or she really is that ignorant. I don\u2019t know which would be worse, but honestly, neither are acceptable. We need our legislators to design policy based on facts, without the influence of laughably outlandish garbage like that coming from Tlaib.\n\nLet me be clear: Tlaib\u2019s behavior at this hearing completely disgusted me \u2014 not just as someone who uses vaping products, but as an American. She had the nerve to not only make statements that fly in the face of facts, but also to act pompously in doing so, as if she were the smartest person in the room. And why? Why does she think she\u2019s smarter; just because she\u2019s a liberal and Porter is conservative? Certainly her whack-a-doo \u201cconspiracy\u201d allegation would suggest that that may be the case. Yes: Tlaib, apparently, believes that if you are a conservative, you are quite likely also a conspiracy theorist. She believes it so strongly that she actually finds it appropriate to bring up during a hearing that is about a nicotine product, without any regard for how disrespectful that is or how that further divides the country. The most mind-boggling part? She also, apparently, believes that she was the one with her head screwed on straight in that exchange.\n\nTlaib, do better. In the meantime; I will continue to hit my Juul to help me cope.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Representative Rashida Tlaib\u2019s performance during a House subcommittee hearing on vaping was so completely, totally absurd that she must either be willfully lying or totally stupid.No, I am not exaggerating.
