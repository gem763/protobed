You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe computation involved checking whether a large set of numbers is truly random \u2013 known as a random sampling problem \u2013 and for now is only a proof-of-concept test. It may not have many immediate practical uses beyond figuring out random numbers, but the eventual implications are world-changing.\n\nWhat is a quantum computer?\n\nFirst theorised by the physicist Richard Feynman in 1982, quantum computers are fundamentally different to classical computers in the way they transfer and store data.\n\nRather than using traditional bits \u2013 the \u20181\u2019s\u2019 and \u20180\u2019s\u2019 used in digital communications \u2013 quantum computers make use of qubits.\n\nThese exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can act as a \u20181\u2019 and a \u20180\u2019 at the same time.\n\nBy doing so, each new qubit that is added to a quantum computing system makes it exponentially more powerful than classical computers.\n\nWho is working on them and why?\n\nBeyond Google, many of the world\u2019s largest companies are currently developing quantum computing systems.\n\nTechnology firms like IBM, Intel and Microsoft are building their own machines and investing huge amounts of resources to not miss out on the next computing revolution.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

By simulating all the variables, town planners would be able to figure out ways to eliminate traffic congestion and pollution issues \u2013 or at least understand them better.\n\nBut if they could simulate entire cities, then why not entire universes? This was the question posed by MIT professor Seth Lloyd, who suggested that the world we exist in is in fact a giant quantum computer.\n\nBeyond theories that we are actually living inside The Matrix, this ability to perform complex simulations could eventually see quantum computers simulate the beginnings of the universe and maybe one day answer some of science\u2019s most puzzling questions.", "description": "If a leaked Google research paper is to be believed, a\u00a0revolutionary new form of computer has\u00a0just performed a calculation that was previously impossible on even the most powerful of modern supercomputers.", "authors": ["Anthony Cuthbertson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/18/quantum-computing-explained-matrix-universe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
