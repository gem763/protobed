Well, actor Chris Noth, the man who played Mr. Big from 1998 to 2004 on the hit HBO show, revealed that not only is he open to another \u201cSATC\u201d flick, but that this time around, Mr. Big would certainly be drinking an a\u00f1ejo Ambhar Tequila on the rocks.\n\n\u201cI would have said Mr. Big is like, \u2018No, no, not whiskey. Ambhar, please? A\u00f1ejo?\u2019\u201d said Noth with a smile.\n\nThe Golden Globe nominee and SAG Award nominated actor became part owner of the premium tequila company in 2018. Jaime Celorio, CEO and founder of Ambhar Tequila, told Fox News that the actor is much more than a face for the brand.\n\nSARAH JESSICA PARKER TEASES WINE COLLECTION, SAYS SHE'S 'EXCITED FOR ITS SEPTEMBER WORLDWIDE LAUNCH'\n\n\u201cThis is a partnership, it\u2019s not just a \u2018celebrity endorsement\u2019 or a \u2018spokesperson\u2019 relationship. As an owner of the company, Chris is closely involved in the business and he has a vested interest in the brand\u2019s success,\u201d Celorio said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s very helpful too that Chris is so well-known for his cool, confident, and self-assured demeanor \u2013 both on-stage and off \u2013 and that certainly helps reinforce that Ambhar Tequila is a sophisticated and refined spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to be involved with things that I don\u2019t actually use or consume,\u201d Noth echoed of his commitment to the role. \u201cThis is good tequila, I'm gonna sit with this, smoke a cigar with this, think about my life with this. I feel proud to have my name associated with this company.\u201d\n\nIn a larger sense, the tequila industry in America is only getting hotter. According to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the total value of the spirit in the U.S. in 2018 was reported as $5.6 billion. The figure is growing, too -- the 5-year compound annual growth forecast of tequila in the U.S. from 2013 to 2018 is up 5.4 percent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nNoth and Celorio agree that a major aspect of the actor\u2019s work with Ambhar will be seeking distributors for the premium booze. Noth likens the task to two industries he knows well \u2013 acting and music \u2013 given his experience co-owning New York City music venue The Cutting Room.\n\n\u201c[Securing distributors] is just as difficult as the acting business or the music industry. You know there's a lot of competition,\u201d the former \u201cMr. Big\u201d said. \u201cA lot of these distribution companies want to know 100% for sure that if you sign up with them that they're going to make their money.\u201d\n\nAs for hypothetical drink orders, the 64-year-old star imagined what tequila drinks his most famous roles would sip.\n\nLike the infamous Mr. Big, Noth said that his character Peter Florrick from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d would favor an Ambhar A\u00f1ejo neat, while Mike Logan from \u201cLaw & Order\u201d would choose an Ambhar Plata Tequila neat, with a beer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs for his own go-to, Noth said he often drinks A\u00f1ejo with an ice cube and a squeeze of a lemon or lime.\n\nWhile Noth\u2019s tequila order sounds a whole lot like the ever-slick Mr. Big\u2019s, he couldn\u2019t help but share a disclaimer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that the character Mr. Big was a huge character leap for me because I'm not even slightly fussy like him about how I dress or how things have to be or anything like that.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about actor Chris Noth and Ambhar tequila, check out the video above.\n\nEmily DeCiccio is a video producer and reporter for Fox News Digital Originals.
