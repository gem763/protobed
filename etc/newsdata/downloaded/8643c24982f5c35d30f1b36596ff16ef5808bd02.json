All eyes - and headlines - were on Hurricane Dorian. But around the United States and abroad, there was other notable weather that took a backseat to the powerful hurricane. Denver saw a scorching new high temperature for September, and tornadoes whipped through parts of the north-central U.S. Let's glance back at the week that was.\n\nDorian devastates Bahamas\n\nHurricane Dorian unleashed utter devastation in the Bahamas at the start of the week as a powerful and slow-moving Category 5 storm. As of Friday morning, officials announced that the Bahamas death toll stood at 30, but that is anticipated to rise to \"staggering\" numbers as the full extent of the destruction is revealed.\n\nStartling satellite images from start-up company Iceye showed the dramatic difference in Grand Bahama Island before and after Dorian's wrath - and the present-day image was not a pretty sight.\n\nMuch of where land was once visible is now blue as those areas sit underwater. The suffering of Bahamians reeling from the storm is being seen and felt around the world. In the U.S., where Dorian minimally impacted the Florida and Georgia coasts while triggering flooding, tornadoes and power outages along the Carolinas, many people are trying to figure out how to help the ailing island nation.\n\nPower company lineman work to restore power after a tornado hit Emerald Isle, N.C. as Hurricane Dorian moved up the East coast on Thursday, Sept. 5, 2018.

The generators cost about $450 each, and the rest of the big purchase came from peas, coffee, beans and similar items headed to the Bahamas for relief efforts, CNN reported.\n\nThe man said he'd rather not be named and instead wants attention focused on helping people impacted by Dorian. \"It's important that we help each other out. It's better than just sitting there,\" he said in an interview. \"You see a need and you fill it.\"\n\nA visit to the happiest place on Earth is now on hold for one 6-year-old South Carolina boy, but it's all for a great cause. Jermaine Bell put money saved for his birthday trip to Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom toward buying hundreds of chips, hot dogs and water for people who evacuated as Dorian approached.\n\nBell held handmade signs as he stood near a highway to catch the attention of people heading out of the city, and he was able to help over 100 evacuees in just one day.\n\n\"The people that are traveling to go to places, I wanted them to have some food to eat so they can enjoy the ride to the place that they're going to stay at,\" Bell told WJBF.\n\nDenver sets new all-time high temperature\n\nMeanwhile, temperatures in the Mile High City reached a new record this week\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) office in Boulder tweeted on Monday that the temperature at Denver International Airport (DIA) reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit at 3:55 p.m. MDT.\n\n\"That is now a new high for the date and for the month of September. #cowx,\" the tweet read.\n\nTornadoes hit Chicago, Minneapolis\n\nSome parts of the north-central U.S. experienced scary conditions this week, with tornadoes touching down north of Chicago and in Minneapolis.\n\nThe NWS confirmed a tornado touched down near Chicago late Tuesday, hurting at least one person who was in a car that flipped over, The Associated Press reported. It hit near the Waukegan Airport and sliced a narrow 2-mile path of damage to Lake Michigan.\n\nThe tornado also damaged some commercial buildings, trees, roofs and fences. Meteorologists were still trying to determine the tornado's strength but said it packed winds of up to 110 mph.\n\nThe EF1 tornado that struck Monday west of Minneapolis damaged trees and outbuildings, according to the AP. The twister, which touched down east of Watertown, was on the ground for five minutes and traveled 3.5 miles, but no injuries were reported. The NWS office in Grand Forks reported 71-mph wind gusts. More than 22,500 people lost power.\n\nTyphoon Lingling headed towards South Korea after brushing Philippines\n\nAfter battering Japan's Ryukyu Islands, Typhoon Lingling now has its sights set on the Korean Peninsula after battering Japan's Ryuku Islands and sweeping by the Philippines with no major impacts.", "description": "It was impossible to miss the dominating story this week.
