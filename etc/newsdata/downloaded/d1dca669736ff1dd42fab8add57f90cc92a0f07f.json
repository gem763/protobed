Barriers and rules are in place to keep both visitors, staff, and animals safe,\u201d the zoo said in a statement.\n\nThe woman has not been identified, but the zoo is currently filing a criminal trespass report against her, the station said.", "description": "Zoo officials are now pursuing a criminal trespass charge against the unidentified woman.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93cdbe2100003300513bca.png?cache=otw8xcbeql&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
