In a letter to LADOT shared with Motherboard, Uber says it will not share this data due to a number of privacy concerns, and says it will file a lawsuit to stop LADOT from suspending the company's permit to operate in the city.\n\nThe city wants the anonymized data so it can make sure that scooters are being made available to lower-income residents, and to check which companies may be ignoring rules that limit the number of vehicles they are allowed to operate. Activists are concerned about the privacy implications of sharing such data with the city, and argue it could, if deanonymized, unmask individual riders.\n\n\"While all other permitted scooter and bike companies are complying with our rules, Uber has repeatedly refused,\" the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) said in a statement.\n\n\"L.A.\u2019s requirements have been clear since last November, and Uber agreed to abide by them. By 5 pm [Tuesday], we expect Uber to come into compliance or they will face suspension proceedings, which could eventually lead to revocation of their permit,\" the statement added.\n\nDo you work at Uber? We\u2019d love to hear from you.

To be effective, the department requires reasonable information about the tens of thousands of shared vehicles operated by transportation technology companies that use our streets for profit,\" LADOT's statement added.\n\nSubscribe to our new cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.", "description": "The move comes after Uber decided not to provide the location data according to a Los Angeles Department of Transportation deadline.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db99d8f3da7b1008dde1c03/lede/1572445793756-jump-scooter.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8585xh;0xw,0.053xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
