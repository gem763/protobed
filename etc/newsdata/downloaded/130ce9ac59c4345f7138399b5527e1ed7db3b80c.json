A former funeral service attended by foreign dignitaries will go ahead as planned on Saturday.\n\nMugabe's body has been at the centre of a politicised tug of war since he died at the age of 95 in a Singapore hospital last week.\n\nThe government had wanted him interred at Heroes' Acre, a cemetery that Mugabe himself established for prominent veterans of the Bush War against White-ruled Rhodesia that eventually brought him to power in 1980.\n\nMugabe's first wife, Sally Mugabe, is already buried at the site and a plot has been set aside for him alongside her, although it now appears it will not be used.\n\nBut the family said Mugabe had turned against the idea after he was overthrown by Mr Mnangagwa and other former allies in the ruling Zanu PF party, and insisted he should be buried instead alongside his mother and brothers at their home village in Zvimba, about 50 miles outside Harare.\n\nFamily members and neighbours were seen putting up marques in preparation for a wake at the family residence there on Friday.\n\nThe row pitted Mr Manangagwa against Mugabe's widow Grace in a re-run of the bitter power struggle over the succession that led to the coup in 2017 and quickly took on a political character. Allies of Mrs Mugabe who fled the country after Mr Mnangagwa seized power have accused Mr Mnangagwa of attempting to bribe tribal chiefs in a bid to get his way.\n\nThe response to Mugabe's death among the Zimbabwean public has been relatively muted. While thousands of people have filed past his coffin at the capital's Rufalo stadium, there has been no official day of mourning and little outpouring of public grief.\n\nThe battle of the body, by contrast, has gripped the public imagination and dominated the front pages here.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Independent summed up the row with its Friday front page headline: \"betrayed Mugabe fights Mnangagwa from coffin.'\n\nNews Day, a tabloid, described the row as a \"game of brinksmanship\" which the whole country was watching.\n\nThe Daily News, another tabloid, cited an unnamed source who claimed the Mugabe family feared being tormented by the president's vengeful spirit if they ignored his final wishes about his grave site.", "description": "Robert Mugabe's burial was postponed for a month last night as his family and the Zimbabwean government appeared to end a bitter feud over the former president's grave site.\u00a0 Leo Mugabe, the former president's nephew and a family spokesperson, told journalists late on Friday that relatives", "authors": ["Roland Oliphant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ov4YBwxjxVIRQD5hCskuNA--~B/aD0xMDQ4O3c9MTY3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d663759daa6197edfb8bcc7ca89e5a66", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
