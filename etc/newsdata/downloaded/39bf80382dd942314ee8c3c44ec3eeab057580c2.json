Britain is set to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 unless it seeks and is granted an extension by the bloc.\n\n\u201cWe have made genuine effort to bridge the chasm, to reconcile the apparently irreconcilable and to go the extra mile as time runs short,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe new proposals from Johnson\u2019s government, delivered to the EU on Wednesday, focus on maintaining an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland -- the key sticking point to a Brexit deal. The U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.\n\nBORIS JOHNSON DELIVERS 'FINAL OFFER' FOR BREXIT DEAL TO EU, SAYS 'WE CAN, WE MUST AND WE WILL' LEAVE BLOC\n\nEconomists and Johnson\u2019s own government say a no-deal Brexit could lead to significant trade disruptions for Britain, including shortages of medicine and fresh produce.\n\nBut as the day wore on, however, key EU figures started expressing doubt over the new U.K. proposal.\n\nEuropean Union leader Donald Tusk said he was \u201cstill unconvinced\u201d about Johnson\u2019s proposals to unblock the stalled Brexit negotiations even after having a phone call with him.\n\nIrish leader Leo Varadkar told reporters that the new Brexit plans \u201cfall short in a number of aspects,\" and the European parliament supervisory Brexit group argued that the proposals \u201cdo not match even remotely\u201d what is needed for a compromise.\n\nAfter being briefed by EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, the Brexit group declared the proposals were a step back toward an overall deal. The group unites experts from all major groups in the European Parliament, which must approve any final Brexit deal.\n\nBREXIT SAGA: WHAT HAPPENS NOW AFTER SUSPENSION OF UK PARLIAMENT RULED ILLEGAL?\n\nBritish voters narrowly chose to leave the EU in 2016, but the country remains deeply divided over how to do it. Johnson has warned of \u201cgrave consequences for trust in our democracy\u201d if Britain doesn\u2019t leave the EU on the scheduled date of Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson reached out Thursday to both the EU and to the House of Commons with a softer tone, despite the fact the proposals were billed by his own office as a take-it-or-leave-it \u201cfinal offer.\u201d Johnson sought to lower the temperature of Parliament\u2019s heated Brexit debates in recent weeks -- commenting that he was \u201cdisappointed\u2019\u2019 by the tone used by other lawmakers sharply questioning his proposals.\n\nBritish lawmakers though continued to attack the new Brexit plans and Johnson on Thursday, accusing him of deliberately proposing a deal he knows won\u2019t work. The Scottish National Party\u2019s parliamentary leader, Ian Blackford, said the prime minister's proposals simply push the country closer to a no-deal Brexit by offering a plan that the EU is likely to reject.\n\n\u201cThese proposals are unacceptable. They are unworkable. They are undeliverable,\u2019\u2019 Blackford said. \u201cMr. Speaker, it is a plan designed to fail, but of course, the prime minister knows that. By his own desire, this take-it-or-leave-it threat is yet another push towards a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.\"\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said no Labour Party lawmaker can back Johnson\u2019s new Brexit plan, calling it just a \u201crehashed version\u201d of previously rejected proposals.\n\nThe proposal would create \u201can all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland, covering all goods including agrifood.\u201d That would keep Northern Ireland in a regulatory zone with the EU for food, agricultural and industrial products, removing the need for border checks.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe U.K. proposal doesn\u2019t put a time limit on that status, although it would have to be renewed every four years by the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, that assembly has been suspended for more than two years by a dispute between the main Unionist and Nationalist power-sharing parties.\n\nUnder the new U.K. plan, there would still need to be customs checks, but Johnson suggested they could be carried out away from the border at \u201cother points on the supply chain.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit proposals are being met with skepticism Thursday from top European leaders as they say they are \u201cstill unconvinced\u201d and that the plans \u201cfall short in a number of aspects.\u201d", "authors": ["Greg Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/362eb84d-boris-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
