He will be missed by me and everyone he encountered.\u201d\n\nRob Garrison was part of \"The Karate Kid\" franchise. (Photo: Columbia Pictures) More\n\nGarrison\u2019s sister-in-law told TMZ that he died Friday at a hospital in his native West Virginia, where he had been treated for liver and kidney issues over the past month.\n\nGarrison has acted since the late \u201870s, playing parts in both horror film \u201cProm Night\u201d and the drama \u201cBrubaker,\u201d alongside Robert Redford in 1980. He went on to appear in the 1986 movie \u201cIron Eagle\u201d and TV shows including \u201cMacGyver,\u201d \u201cCoach\u201d and \u201cSt. Elsewhere.\u201d\n\nBut it was \u201cKarate Kid\u201d for which he was most recognized. His character, one of the guys bullying hero Daniel (played by Ralph Macchio), memorably tells William Zabka\u2019s Johnny to put Daniel \u201cin a body bag,\u201d during their showdown at the karate meet.\n\nGarrison reprised his role in \u201cThe Karate Kid Part II\u201d in 1986 and, in April, when an episode of the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d reboot \u201cCobra Kai\u201d featured several of Johnny\u2019s old friends. The plot had the gang taking Tommy out of the hospital, where he was being treated for cancer, to take a road trip. They end up camping, and Tommy dies in his sleep.\n\nThe experience meant a lot to Garrison.\n\nThanks everyone for your wonderful comments on my appearance in COBRA KAI. Makes me feel great. Had a wonderful time doing it. \u2014 Rob Garrison (@therobgarrison) April 25, 2019\n\nFollowing the actor\u2019s death, \u201cCobra Kai\u201d writer and producer Jon Hurwitz paid tribute to Garrison on social media.\n\nOur entire Karate Kid/Cobra Kai family is devastated by the news of OG Cobra Rob Garrison's passing. He was a truly gifted performer and an even better man. My heart goes out to Rob's family during this difficult time. #RIP pic.twitter.com/aDiXcQ5ROu \u2014 Jon Hurwitz (@jonhurwitz) September 27, 2019\n\nI'll never forget how moved the entire cast and crew was by Rob's brilliant and heartfelt performance by the campfire. I'll also never forget the laughs we shared later that night over beers as the gang told stories, including some gems Rob had from the set of Iron Eagle. pic.twitter.com/sgPCOBKIxA \u2014 Jon Hurwitz (@jonhurwitz) September 27, 2019\n\nI'm heartened to know how much Rob enjoyed and cherished his time working on Cobra Kai. We were looking forward to seeing his smiling face again this season, as we had plans for Tommy to ride again. But he'll remain in our thoughts every day as we strive to make him proud. #RIP pic.twitter.com/QBjcfJPMq4 \u2014 Jon Hurwitz (@jonhurwitz) September 27, 2019\n\nGarrison is survived by his brother, Patrick, and his wife, Linda.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
