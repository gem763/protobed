OnePlus announced the 7T Pro and the McLaren variant earlier this month, but at the time, it made no mention of a 5G version of the device.\n\nThe McLaren Edition of the phone is similar to the standard 7T Pro model, but it features an orange-and-black color scheme and increases the amount of RAM from 8GB to 12GB. It\u2019s available as a 4G-only model outside of the US, while T-Mobile\u2019s version will support both 4G and 5G.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S10 5G was T-Mobile\u2019s first 5G device\n\nThis will be T-Mobile\u2019s second 5G device after the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, which T-Mobile offered alongside the launch of its 5G network back in June. T-Mobile says that it plans for its 5G network to be available to 200 million people across the US by the end of the year. The company has also announced plans to launch the Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G later in \u201cQ4 this year,\u201d but a concrete release date has not been announced.\n\nThe launch of the limited edition handset also means that it\u2019s now possible to get a OnePlus 7 Pro device on T-Mobile again after the network discontinued the original OnePlus 7 Pro following the launch of the OnePlus 7T. T-Mobile has yet to announce pricing or availability details for its second 5G phone, but it says that these will be announced later this year.", "description": "OnePlus has announced its second 5G phone, the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Edition, which will be be exclusive to T-Mobile in the US.
