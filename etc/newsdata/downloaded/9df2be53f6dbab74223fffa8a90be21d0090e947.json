Getty Images\n\nIt satirises Jackson's attempts to get the Bank of the United States to redistribute funds to \"branch\" banks in various states.\n\nIn the image the president is depicted as an ass, who causes chaos by galloping into a group of chicks, representing the US financial system.\n\nJackson was a staunch opponent of the institution that was later to become the Treasury, which he thought was corrupt, and accused of cutting off investment for the westward expansion of the US.\n\nIt was German-born cartoonist Thomas Nast \u2014 a Republican \u2014 who really popularized the two symbols. The GOP elephant made its first appearance in its 1874 cartoon \"The Third Term Panic,\" which was published in Harper's Weekly.\n\n\"The Third Term Panic\" by Thomas Nast, 1874. CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThe cartoon depicts a donkey dressed in lion's clothing, scaring a group of animals around it. An elephant represents the mighty Republican vote, stumbling into a hidden pit.\n\nNast was satirizing was what he saw as the panic caused by an editorial in magazine The New York Herald, which accused then-President Ulysses S. Grant, a Republican and Civil War general, of \"Caesarism.\"\n\nThe article claimed Grant was attempting to illegally seize more power \u2014 like the Roman ruler Julius Caesar \u2014 by apparently gearing up to campaign for an unprecedented third term.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, in the image the donkey/lion represents not the Democrats but the New York Herald newspaper. The Democrats are represented as a skittish fox cringing at the edge of the pit.\n\nIn other images, Nast did portray Democrats as a donkey, picking up a symbol that had largely been forgotten after Jackson left office.\n\nThis 1870 image is called \"A Live Jackass Kicking a Dead Lion,\" and is the first ever to represent the Democrats \u2014 rather than a particular Democrat \u2014 as a donkey.\n\nThe donkey represents Democrat-dominated newspapers in the southern states \u2014 nicknamed the Copperhead papers \u2014 which opposed the Civil War. They are shown kicking President Abraham Lincoln's recently-deceased war secretary, EM Stanton.\n\n\"A Live Jack-Ass Kicking a Dead Lion,\" by Thomas Nast, 1869. Kean Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe artist's own political sympathies played an important role in determining which parties got associated with which animals.\n\nKat Eschner, a culture journalist, wrote in 2017 for The Smithsonian magazine:\n\n\"Nast was also a loyal Republican, which is perhaps why the Democrats got saddled with a jackass as a popular symbol (the party has never officially adopted it), while the Republicans got the large and relatively noble elephant, which the party did officially adopt as a symbol.\"\n\nIt was an era when cartoonists had a great power, distilling complex political disputes for millions of readers.\n\nThough the details of the disputes may be largely forgotten \u2014 the fact that the symbols used in them are in still used to this day are testament to their power.", "description": "Satirising long-forgotten political disputes, a German cartoonist in the 1870s popularised two symbols which endure to this day.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d933f012e22af564072ba84?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
