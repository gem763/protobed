Ilhan Omar in a rally on her home turf.\n\nTrump is calling Omar \u201ca disgrace to our country,\u201d reminding thousands of supporters in a Minneapolis arena of remarks she made on Israel that some people saw as anti-Semitic. Omar denied any anti-Semitic intent but apologized for them.\n\nTrump is also again raising allegations by some conservatives that Omar married her brother to commit immigration fraud - a claim Omar has called \u201cdisgusting lies.\u201d\n\nTrump has sought to portray the Somali-American lawmaker as a symbol of the liberal shift in her party, and earlier this year tweeted she should \u201cgo back\u201d to her home country rather than criticize the United States. He didn\u2019t repeat that rhetoric Thursday night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump is attacking Minnesota Rep.
