There are only seven men in Europe with a deadlier record. One, it so happens, is Sergio Aguero.\n\nDislodging Manchester City\u2019s greatest ever goalscorer is an unenviable task and it is fair to say that at times last year Jesus was questioning whether it was all worth it. Although only 22, he would lead the line for the majority of Europe\u2019s elite, as he does for Brazil, ahead of Roberto Firmino.\n\nOther than Aguero, only Messrs Messi, Mbappe, Lewandowski, Neymar, Cavani and Alcacer score at a quicker rate than Jesus. Three play for one runaway club in France.\n\nGabriel Jesus (right) celebrated after giving Manchester City the lead at Crystal Palace\n\nAnother is perhaps the greatest player who has ever lived. Saturday\u2019s goal \u2014 a header off his shoulder, manufactured by the swan dive to meet Bernardo Silva\u2019s teasing cross \u2014 meant he has now scored in each of his last seven starts for City. \u2018I have difficulty with headers,\u2019 he laughed. \u2018It was a little bit lucky.\u2019\n\nAguero, whose contract ends in 2021, is not going to be around forever. He visited Argentina during the international break before returning to training \u2014 in turn smashing up his car in Hale. Jesus was deemed as having the rhythm to start, a decision that resulted in his 50th goal for the club since joining in 2017.\n\n\u2018I thought the club bought an incredible young player at an incredible price (\u00a327million from Palmeiras),\u2019 Guardiola said.\n\nThe 22-year-old Brazilian striker stooped to head in his 50th goal for Manchester City\n\n\u2018One of their best signings. Honestly, when he arrived he had an incredible impact. Then he suffered the injuries. Competing with Sergio is maybe the most difficult thing. Sergio is a legend, an outrageous player. Amazing.\u2019\n\nOver the last 12 months, Jesus has been consistently consistent with 26 goals in all competitions.\n\n\u2018On the pitch, I\u2019m more mature, more experienced, with and without the ball,\u2019 Jesus said. \u2018I\u2019m more calm, I understand the game more and I also understand our style of play better. Also, my skills have improved since I arrived. I\u2019m better with my left foot, with headers, with my position on the pitch.\n\nSergio Aguero is one of just seven strikers in Europe to score at a faster rate than Jesus\n\n\u2018Off the pitch, I have always been very mature, very responsible. I have grown up as a person. I have always been very attached to my family.\u2019 Attached to the extent that his friends and family failing to renew UK visas coincided with his form dipping last year.\n\nJesus was away from them for the first time and no amount of help from City could bridge that gap. He is becoming less dependent on them after starting a relationship with Fernanda Queiroz.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very happy,\u2019 Jesus said. \u2018Last season I had a difficult start to the season. This season is going to be different. I work hard and focus on the goal all the time, and I think that\u2019s why I score a lot.\u2019\n\nPep Guardiola insists City must become more clinical if they are to win the Champions League\n\nBut Guardiola wants more, though. From Jesus and from everyone else. Here came the frank claim that City are not ready to challenge for the Champions League title.\n\nOf 21 shots, only two flew beyond Wayne Hennessey, and the City manager insisted that is not good enough. \u2018The people say about the Champions League, that target,\u2019 Guardiola said. \u2018We still are not ready. We create a lot, don\u2019t concede, but can improve.\n\n\u2018But Gabriel\u2019s mentality means he\u2019ll always have success. He is hungry, he wants to become an important striker around the world. We are lucky to have him.\u2019", "description": "JACK GAUGHAN AT SELHURST PARK:Gabriel Jesus is scoring a goal every 108 minutes since the start of last season.
