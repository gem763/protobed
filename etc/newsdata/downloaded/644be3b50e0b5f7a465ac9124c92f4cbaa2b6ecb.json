He was a managed I enjoyed working under,\u2019 Schneiderlin told Sky Sports.\n\n\u2018He came after a time with Van Gaal where I played 40 games and I was in the Euro [with France].\n\nSchneiderlin featured frequently during Louis van Gaal\u2019s reign at United (AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I then had a week before the season started and I didn\u2019t really have a proper pre-season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And with Mourinho he was clear he said he\u2019s worked with a lot of midfield players, he said to me he likes me as a footballer but that he knows some players in my position more because he had a pre-season with them, so that was not a problem.\n\n\u2018I was a bit too impatient, I think, when I wanted to leave because after three or four months I was getting frustrated and everything.\n\n\u2018But it was something I learned and he\u2019s a manager with a lot of knowledge on football. He\u2019s someone who I liked.\n\n\u2018It was a pleasure to play for Man United. After that, maybe I should have had more chances but maybe I should have told myself, keep working, keep working, it will come\u2019.\n\n\u2018I use the example of Ander Herrera, under Van Gaal he didn\u2019t play for three or four months, but he kept patient, he played with Mourinho and got his move to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\u2018So sometimes in football you need to be patient and work.\u2019", "description": "Morgan Schneiderlin admits he lacked the patience to be a success under Jose Mourinho at Manchester United.
