When I got to the school and saw him he burst into tears and I did too.\n\n\"A group of boys had attacked him in school and he had blood pouring underneath his eye.\n\n\"He was hit with a metal bar which had a hook on the end of it and he was struck 12 times. His head was physically misshapen. He was inconsolable.\n\n\"He had PTSD and a mental breakdown and was off school for three months. I wasn't letting him go back there.\n\n\"He tried to kill himself when he was 11. He was reliving it in his sleep, crying and begging for help - it was just heartbreaking to see.\n\n\"Jake is autistic, so it is hard for him to communicate the way he is feeling, but after two years of counseling he is still not right.\n\n\"He has really bad anxiety and he is scarred for life, with scars on his face, shoulder and knee.\"\n\n(Image: Diane Warfield)\n\nDiane said it \"broke her\" watching her son go through it and it has had an impact on how Jake sees the world.\n\nShe said: \"It was horrible for me as his mum. It broke me. He can\u2019t go out on the streets on his own because he doesn\u2019t feel safe unless he is with someone.\n\n\"We can\u2019t go on holiday because he can\u2019t deal with groups of people. He is scared, absolutely petrified and he will never be the same. This is what he has been left with.\"\n\nDiane, who also has three other children, is now joining other parents of children who have experienced bullying to share Jake's story in the hope of changing laws about bullying.\n\n(Image: Diane Warfield)\n\nShe said: \"I will be speaking at the event and telling Jake\u2019s story. It was nearly three years ago, but it has changed our lives compeltely.\n\n\"We want to try and get some laws changed to stop bullying because it needs to stop.\n\n\"It is still going on in schools everywhere up and down the country and we want to stop others from going through what we have been through.\n\n\"People are taking their lives because of bullies. It is not acceptable.\n\n\"It is unbelievable what bullying has done to Jake.\"\n\n(Image: Diane Warfield)\n\nThe campaign will be launched on October 25 by Jason Barnett from Leeds, an advocate for vulnerable children and a former teacher.\n\nThe campaign group currently includes more than 75 families from across the UK, some of whom have set up foundations in memory of their loved ones that have been lost\n\nA spokesman for the de Ferrers Academy, where Jake was a pupil at the time of the attack, said: \"The academy has a range of strategies in place to minimise bullying and clear procedures to address it should it occur.\n\n\"We operate an entirely non-teaching support and guidance structure to ensure that pastoral staff are always available should a student need to report an issue.\n\n\"This is supplemented by inclusion centres on each campus and staff who provide counselling, should the need arise.\n\n\"As part of our safeguarding review with the local authority, we have also introduced an email student helpline for bullying which guarantees a response within the day.\n\n\"All bullying incidents are recorded and reported to the local governing body.\"\n\nIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 by calling 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org", "description": "The bullies were expelled, but the attack has left a lasting impact on Jake, now 14, from Staffordshire, who subsequently tried to take his own life", "authors": ["Rhea Turner", "Image", "Diane Warfield"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567276.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_111019DiWarfield_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
