However the objects of mediated communication - such as the smartphone - still has a cold interface that doesn't allow natural interaction and input.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIn this project, I wanted to make available the perfect human interface that is the skin for existing devices.\u201d\n\nThe bizarre case comes in two forms - one with a basic, uniform surface, and one with an eerily realistic skin-like surface.\n\nThis artificial skin is made of a layer of stretchable copper wire, which sits between two layers of silicone.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Teyssier added: \u201cTo improve the visual appearance of the interface, the excess of silicone can be trimmed before being folded around the side of the hypodermis layer and glued with silicone glue.\n\n\u201cPaint or makeup can be added to shade the artificial skin with flesh like tonal variation, thus increasing anthropomorphism.\u201d\n\nThe case is being presented at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in New Orleans, and it remains unclear when, or if, it will be available to buy.", "description": "Researchers from Telecom Paris have created the strange case, which responds to touches including tickles, strokes and pinches", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20665257.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Artificial-skin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
