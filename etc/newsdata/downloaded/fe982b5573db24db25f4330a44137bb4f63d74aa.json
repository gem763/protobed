I guess it\u2019s a warning, if you do something heinous here, they\u2019ll come to get you.'\n\nDetectives held a press conference to announce the news on Friday. Sara Yarborough's mother, Laura, is pictured center left\n\nPolice have now formally charged Nicholas with with first-degree murder with sexual motivation.\n\nMeanwhile, genealogy websites have helped crack multiple cold cases in the past several months.\n\nOne site helped unmask the identity of the Golden State Killer - a notorious rapist and murderer who terrorized California between 1976 and 1984.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1981 murder of a Colorado teenager was solved last month after one of the killer's relatives uploaded their DNA to a genetic genealogy database.", "description": "On Thursday, police charged Patrick Leon Nicholas with the slaying ofl Sara Yarborough after they obtained his DNA and matched it against samples taken from the crime scene 28 years ago.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/02/19318622-0-image-a-7_1570238205988.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
