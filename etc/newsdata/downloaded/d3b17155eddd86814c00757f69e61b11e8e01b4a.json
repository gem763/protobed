Then Mulvaney went on television Sunday to defend his boss in effusive terms \u2014 and ended up making a new problematic comment.\n\nExplaining why Trump had tried to steer an international summit to one of the president\u2019s own properties before giving up on the idea, Mulvaney said Trump \u201cstill considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d That did nothing to allay concerns that the Republican president has used his office to enrich his business interests.\n\nThe bookended performances over the span of a few days were panned by the president\u2019s allies and cast doubt on Mulvaney\u2019s job security at the White House.\n\nMulvaney denied on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that there was any consideration of his resignation, \u201cAbsolutely, positively not.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, Mulvaney tried to put a positive spin on Trump\u2019s selection of his Doral, Florida, golf resort to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven world summit. It was also an opportunity for Mulvaney demonstrate his ability to defend the president.\n\nHe struggled, in the process offering fresh fodder to critics of a president already besieged by an impeachment inquiry. He asserted in the briefing that military aid to Ukraine was delayed partly because Trump wanted officials there to look into a security company hired by the Democratic National Committee that discovered that Russian agents had broken into the committee\u2019s network in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters. \u201cDid he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that.\u201d Mulvaney continued: \u201cThat\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d Trump\u2019s personal lawyers quickly dissociated themselves from the chief of staff\u2019s comments.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s description of the administration\u2019s handling of the Ukraine aid amounted to a quid pro quo, though he later claimed his comments had been misconstrued.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Mulvaney told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d as host Chris Wallace repeatedly confronted him with his own comments. \u201cThat\u2019s what people said that I said.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to defend the comments in an interview Sunday with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will leave to the chief of staff to explain what it is he said and what he intended,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nMulvaney is unaware of any effort to replace him, according to a person close to him who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. The president has also expressed his support for Mulvaney to the acting chief of staff\u2019s team, the person said. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Sunday afternoon that Mulvaney still has the confidence of the president.\n\nThe news conference on Thursday left aides in the West Wing dumbfounded at the former South Carolina congressman\u2019s performance and some quarters of Trump\u2019s orbit \u2014 the Justice Department and Trump\u2019s personal attorney, among them \u2014 dissociating themselves from his account. The president himself, already angry that Republicans were not defending him on Syria and Doral, was also displeased that Mulvaney only made the headlines worse, according to three White House officials and Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nStill, a swift dismissal doesn\u2019t appear on the horizon, according to nine staffers and outside advisers, who noted the difficulties Trump has faced attracting and retaining high quality White House staff even before the impeachment episode. The shortage of viable replacements has kept other officials in their posts months after he soured on them.\n\nEven before Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry, Mulvaney was on thin ice, with diminished status in the White House. Holding the job of acting chief of staff since January, Mulvaney has frustrated aides who saw him as less willing than his predecessors to challenge the president.\n\nOnce Democrats began investigations meant to remove Trump from office, Mulvaney drew the brunt of criticism from presidential allies who felt the White House wasn\u2019t prepared to fight back forcefully.\n\nHe has also clashed with White House counsel Pat Cipollone, sometimes mentioned as a potential Mulvaney successor, over strategy and tactics in response to impeachment. Mulvaney has complained that he had been iced out of the process, which the lawyer was treating as a legal, not political, matter.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision late Saturday to reverse course on his much-criticized plan to host the G-7 at Doral was the latest move that called into question Mulvaney\u2019s job security.\n\nMulvaney had insisted that White House staff concluded that Doral was \u201cfar and away the best physical facility\u201d and tried to push back at concerns raised by Democrats and some Republicans that Trump was using the presidency to enrich himself.\n\nMulvaney said Sunday that Trump was \u201chonestly surprised at the level of pushback\u201d on his choice of Doral.\n\nThat notion struck some Trump allies as hollow, because the uproar was resounding in August when the president first floated the idea of choosing Doral. They argued that the president\u2019s aides, Mulvaney first among them, either should have persuaded him not to hold it there or devised a better communications strategy.\n\n\u201cCould we have put on an excellent G-7 at Doral? Absolutely,\u201d Mulvaney concluded on Fox. \u201cWill we end up putting on an excellent G-7 someplace else? Yes we will.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For Mick Mulvaney, the hits just keep on coming.
