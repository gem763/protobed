Yesterday, the pair refreshed five-month highs around the 1.30 psychological level which served as a resistance. On Friday, the pound retreats marginally and has settled around 1.2850, awaiting further development surrounding Brexit.\n\nThe recent rally came as the EU and UK agreed on a Brexit deal.

Should the Parliament vote against the deal, the pair could decline dramatically from the current levels and get back below the key moving averages.\n\nIn the immediate term, GBPUSD may stay afloat, with sterling derives some support from recent comments by Bank of England\u2019s Ramdsen who said that smooth Brexit would put rate hikes on the table.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Helen Rush covering: GBP/USD.
