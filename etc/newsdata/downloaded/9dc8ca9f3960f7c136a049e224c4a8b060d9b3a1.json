To achieve this, Telstra will look at areas serviced only by 3G and assess its product portfolio, the company said.\n\nTelstra switched on its 3G network in 2006. The 3G network initially operated in the 850Hz band before it was upgraded in 2010.\n\nIn 2018, the telco switched off its CDMA network to provide extra spectrum for its 3G network.\n\nSimilarly, it shuttered its 2G network in December 2016 and refarmed the spectrum for 4G.\n\n5G services were switched on by Telstra a year ago, with the launch covering 50 base stations.\n\nThe telco expects 5G to be a strong growth engine, CEO Andy Penn said during the company's annual retail shareholder day last month.\n\n\"ARPUs tend to increase, particularly in the early stages of a rollout,\" Penn said. \"So we see that happening in 5G as well as we look forward over the next couple of years.\"\n\nPenn added that with second generation 5G chips heading into devices later this year, the company expects 5G uptake to increase.\n\n\"I think what history has shown us is that, as we put these technologies in the hands of our customers, they respond very positively and it's tended to lead to improvement in revenues across the industry,\" he said.\n\nTelstra announced in May that it would charge customers AU$15 per month for 5G connectivity on some of its plans next year.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTelstra mixes up physical and digital realities for better water flow\n\nThe Australian telco giant is exploring the possible applications of mixed reality through the creation of digital twins.\n\nTelstra bringing eSIM support to iPhones\n\nAll consumer and small business customers can now replace their physical SIM, if they have a compatible Apple device.\n\nTelstra and Ericsson to enhance MCG mobile coverage with 5G\n\nIt comes just in time for this weekend's AFL grand final taking place at the MCG.\n\nMicrosoft and Telstra team up for business data sharing platform\n\nAzure used for upcoming Data Hub product targeted at water management, agribusiness, and connected supply chain.\n\nTelstra Mining Services to deploy underground LTE network in Queensland\n\nAn initial 6.5 kilometre private network will be created for South32's Cannington mine.", "description": "Spectrum to be shifted across to 5G services.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/13/2d0f44ee-0a89-4161-90f6-8af47a088513/thumbnail/770x578/b19d230c93a4a92afd84ef4b9a8a9622/telstra-mobile-cell-tower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
