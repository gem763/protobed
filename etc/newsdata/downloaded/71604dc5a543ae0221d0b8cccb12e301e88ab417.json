It\u2019s a long list from the lung area to the huge disability in his feet.\n\n\u201cI will call him out and if I get home I will beat him up. He\u2019s bigger than me so he can lie on me but I\u2019m quicker.\u201d\n\nIn the new mixed 4x400m relay heats Martyn Rooney, Rabah Yousif, Zoey Clark, Emily Diamond reached Sunday\u2019s final after coming fourth.\n\nSteph Twell was 15th in the 10,000m as the title went to the Netherlands\u2019 Sifan Hassan.\n\nElsewhere, Jamaica\u2019s Tajay Gayle won the long jump with the 10th biggest jump of all time, 8.69m.\n\nPA", "description": "Christian Coleman stormed to 100 metres victory at the World Championships as Great Britain\u2019s Zharnel Hughes missed out on a medal.
