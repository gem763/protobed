GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment.\n\nGross domestic income (GDI) is the sum of incomes earned and costs incurred in the production of GDP. In national economic accounting, GDP and GDI are conceptually equal. In practice, GDP and GDI differ because they are constructed using largely independent source data.\n\nCurrent-dollar estimates are valued in the prices of the period when the transactions occurred\u2014that is, at \"market value.\" Also referred to as \"nominal estimates\" or as \"current-price estimates.\"\n\nReal values are inflation-adjusted estimates\u2014that is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes.\n\nThe gross domestic purchases price index measures the prices of final goods and services purchased by U.S. residents.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditure price index measures the prices paid for the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, \"persons.\"\n\nPersonal income is the income received by, or on behalf of, all persons from all sources: from participation as laborers in production, from owning a home or business, from the ownership of financial assets, and from government and business in the form of transfers. t includes income from domestic sources as well as the rest of world. It does not include realized or unrealized capital gains or losses.\n\n\n\nDisposable personal income is the income available to persons for spending or saving. It is equal to personal income less personal current taxes.\n\nPersonal outlays is the sum of personal consumption expenditures, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments.\n\nPersonal saving is personal income less personal outlays and personal current taxes.\n\nThe personal saving rate is personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income.\n\nProfits from current production, referred to as corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) and capital consumption (CCAdj) adjustment in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), is a measure of the net income of corporations before deducting income taxes that is consistent with the value of goods and services measured in GDP. The IVA and CCAdj are adjustments that convert inventory withdrawals and depreciation of fixed assets reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost economic measures used in the national income and product accounts. Profits for domestic industries reflect profits for all corporations located within the geographic borders of the United States. The rest-of-the-world (ROW) component of profits is measured as the difference between profits received from ROW and profits paid to ROW.\n\nFor more definitions, see the Glossary: National Income and Product Accounts.\n\nStatistical conventions\n\nAnnual-vs-quarterly rates. Quarterly seasonally adjusted values are expressed at annual rates, unless otherwise specified. This convention is used for BEA's featured, seasonally adjusted measures to facilitate comparisons with related and historical data. For details, see the FAQ \"Why does BEA publish estimates at annual rates?\" Quarterly not seasonally adjusted values are expressed only at quarterly rates.\n\nPercent changes.Percent changes in quarterly seasonally adjusted series are displayed at annual rates, unless otherwise specified. For details, see the FAQ \"How is average annual growth calculated?\" Percent changes in quarterly not seasonally adjusted values are calculated from the same quarter one year ago. All published percent changes are calculated from unrounded data.\n\nCalendar years and quarters. Unless noted otherwise, annual and quarterly data are presented on a calendar basis.\n\nQuantities and prices. Quantities, or \"real\" volume measures, and prices are expressed as index numbers with a specified reference year equal to 100 (currently 2012). Quantity and price indexes are calculated using a Fisher-chained weighted formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent periods (quarters for quarterly data and annuals for annual data). For details on the calculation of quantity and price indexes, see Chapter 4: Estimating Methods in the NIPA Handbook.\n\nChained-dollar values are calculated by multiplying the quantity index by the current dollar value in the reference year (2012) and then dividing by 100. Percent changes calculated from real quantity indexes and chained-dollar levels are conceptually the same; any differences are due to rounding. Chained-dollar values are not additive because the relative weights for a given period differ from those of the reference year. In tables that display chained-dollar values, a \"residual\" line shows the difference between the sum of detailed chained-dollar series and its corresponding aggregate.\n\nUpdates to GDP\n\nBEA releases three vintages of the current quarterly estimate for GDP: \"Advance\" estimates are released near the end of the first month following the end of the quarter and are based on source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency; \"second\" and \"third\" estimates are released near the end of the second and third months, respectively, and are based on more detailed and more comprehensive data as they become available.\n\nThe table below shows the average revisions to the quarterly percent changes in real GDP between different estimate vintages, without regard to sign.\n\nVintage Average Revision\n\nWithout Regard to Sign\n\n(percentage points, annual rates) Advance to second 0.5 Advance to third 0.6 Second to third 0.3 Note - Based on estimates from 1993 through 2018. For more information on GDP updates, see Revision Information on the BEA Web site.\n\nAnnual and comprehensive updates are typically released in late July. Annual updates generally cover at least the 5 most recent calendar years (and their associated quarters) and incorporate newly available major annual source data as well as some changes in methods and definitions to improve the accounts. Comprehensive (or benchmark) updates are carried out at about 5-year intervals and incorporate major periodic source data, as well as major conceptual improvements.\n\nUnlike GDP, an advance current quarterly estimate of GDI is not released because data on domestic profits and on net interest of domestic industries are not available. For fourth quarter estimates, these data are not available until the third estimate.", "description": "Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the third quarter of 2019 (table 1), according to the \"advance\" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 2.0 percent.\n\nThe GDP estimate released today is based on source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency (see \u201cSource Data for the Advance Estimate\u201d on page 2). The \"second\" estimate for the third quarter, based on more complete data, will be released on November 27, 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
