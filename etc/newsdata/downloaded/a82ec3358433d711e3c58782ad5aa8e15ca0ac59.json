I think the doubt is that they\u2019ve been so reluctant to overrule things. Mike Dean, I always thought he\u2019d be the one who\u2019d be confident enough to do it.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a bad touch and an instinctive lunge. It\u2019s not that excessive force where he\u2019s jumping in at it. But he actually holds his leg into it and you can see why it\u2019s been overturned.\u2019\n\nThe Southampton left-back caught Leicester forward Perez with a high challenge\n\nVAR was consulted after the challenge, with Mike Dean deciding Bertrand should be sent off\n\nBertrand was angry at the decision but replays showed that he deserved to be dismissed\n\nThe dismissal of the 30-year-old threw Southampton into further disarray following a chaotic start to the game.\n\nLeicester proceeded to win 9-0 - the biggest away win in Premier League history, and the joint-biggest win in the division.\n\nAyoze Perez and Jamie Vardy both scored hat-tricks, while, in addition Chilwell, Youri Tielemans and James Maddison also managed to get on the scoresheet.", "description": "Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand became the first Premier League player to be sent off by VAR during his side's game at home to Leicester.", "authors": ["Jeorge Bird For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/20/20195438-0-image-a-21_1572032584614.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
