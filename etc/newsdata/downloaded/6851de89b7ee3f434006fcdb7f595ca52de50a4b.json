It said consumers often found it difficult to identify where the original report came from and this was hurting the ability to monetise original reporting.\n\n\"As such, media organisations that republish articles are able to compete effectively for online audiences with the content originators, who may have invested significantly in uncovering and/or producing the story,\" the ACCC said.\n\n\"This may potentially reduce the incentives for news media businesses to invest in investigative journalism and other news content that is costly to produce.\"\n\nGoogle's changes come as the federal government prepares its full response to the ACCC's report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle came out strongly against two recommendations \u2013a code of conduct to govern its business dealings with media companies and being forced to offer users of its mobile operating system Android a choice for their default search engine in their browsers.\n\nThe ACCC also recommended that a branch be established within the commission to monitor and investigate algorithms used by companies such as Google and Facebook.\n\n'Details do matter'\n\nMr Gomes would not say whether Google supported regulatory oversight of its algorithms.\n\n\"We have to see what form it takes in more detail. I think it\u2019s hard to comment in the abstract on these things because the details do matter ... we have a process and system which is very much geared towards making changes and adjusting search,\" he said.\n\nThe methodology around search and changes to the algorithms were geared towards getting good-quality search results and doing the right things by users, he said.\n\n\"That\u2019s what aligned with our long-term interest, I think it\u2019s aligned with users and, if anybody looks at that process in more detail, I think that\u2019s what would be evident,\" Mr Gomes said.\n\n\"We do bring information to a lot of people \u2013 questions about that is a natural part of playing this role. I see that as just a natural part of the role we play in getting information to people.\"\n\nThe reporter travelled to California courtesy of Google", "description": "Google has faced heavy criticism from all corners of the media for the way it brings up news in its Google Search and Google News rankings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5963%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_712%2C$y_220/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/449875075606a13c0cd9c82b3752cfb892a4bdd7", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
