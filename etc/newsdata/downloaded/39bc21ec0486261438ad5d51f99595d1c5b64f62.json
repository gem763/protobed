This fall, broadway veteran Carolee Carmello has joined the the national tour of Hello, Dolly! as it heads into its second year, and Vulture has the first look at her in the character\u2019s famous red dress and skyscraper-high headpiece. Carmello, a three-time Tony nominee for Parade, Lestat, and Scandalous, is replacing Betty Buckley on the tour, and following in the footsteps of Bette Midler, Donna Murphy, and Bernadette Peters, who led the show on Broadway. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those iconic images that you as an actress have in the back of your mind,\u201d Carmello told Vulture of her big entrance on the stairs of the Harmonia Gardens, which precedes the scene above. \u201cThe curtain opens and you just stand there and people applaud because you\u2019re standing there. I barely have to do anything, and then I just have to manage to walk down the stairs without falling, which so far I\u2019ve been able to do.\u201d\n\nDolly! marks the first time Carmello\u2019s set out on the road with a show since joining a national tour of Falsettos in 1993. (She also previously appeared in tours of Chess, Les Miz, and Big River.) In a sense, she feels like she\u2019s right back where she belongs. \u201cI had children who needed to grow up and leave the house,\u201d Carmello said, her youngest son having gone off to college a month before she started in Dolly!, \u201cso it was perfect timing.\u201d\n\nCarmello is currently in performances in St. Louis and the tour\u2019s schedule will take her on through Oklahoma City, Tucson, Hartford, and Detroit in the coming weeks. As she finds her way into the role, she told Vulture that she\u2019s been figuring out the balance of the show\u2019s humor as well as Dolly\u2019s quieter monologues. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that those are coming across as well as I\u2019m trying to make them, because it\u2019s a nice juxtaposition,\u201d Carmello said. \u201cShe\u2019s so smart and so fast, but then when she\u2019s alone and she\u2019s sort of in her own mind and communicating with her deceased husband, there\u2019s just this beautiful, sweet, emotional moment.\u201d\n\nBetty Buckley, the show\u2019s previous Dolly and Carmello\u2019s former castmate in Lincoln Center Theater\u2019s Elegies, gave Carmello \u201cwhatever tips she could about what she learned over the year she was doing it.\u201d Most of which, as it turns out, centered on managing the show\u2019s elaborate costumes, specifically those hats and headpieces. Buckley told her \u201cto be careful walking through doorways and getting in and out of little spots on the set,\u201d Carmello said. \u201cIt was good to remember, because I do have a tendency to walk through doors and not realize that I\u2019m twice as big as I think I am.\u201d", "description": "See a first look at Carolee Carmello in the national tour of Hello, Dolly!, who\u2019s replacing Betty Buckley as it heads into its second year.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/08/08-carolee-carmello-hello-dolly.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
