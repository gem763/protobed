Russia's Yandex launches video service aimed at rivaling YouTube\n\nBy Nadezhda Tsydenova and Anna Rzhevkina\n\n(Reuters) - Russian internet giant Yandex is launching a video streaming service aimed at rivaling Google's YouTube that will allow users to publish videos on its personal recommendation platform Yandex Zen, the company said on Friday.\n\nTech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and YouTube have been adding features to their video streaming services as the demand for online video traffic grows.\n\nIn its latest move, Yandex is following in the footsteps of China's Toutiao, a core product of Beijing-based company ByteDance. Toutiao has a video channel where bloggers can upload content and an algorithm recommends it to users.\n\nYandex Zen, which selects content based on user preferences, will allow bloggers to publish up to 15-minute-long videos.\n\nDuring testing of the new service, the popularity of video products has already outstripped other content. Yandex Zen recorded a total of 20 million video views per day, while the daily audience was 11 million users.\n\nMore than half of all Russians watch video content through Yandex's search engine, but it's still in third place after the largest video streaming website YouTube and the country\u2019s biggest social network VKontakte, according to a recent survey by Deloitte.\n\nIn August, the monthly audience for Yandex Zen was nearly 50 million people.", "description": "Russia's Yandex launches video service aimed at rivaling YouTube", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB4E0IS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
