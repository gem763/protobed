One shows her munching on watermelons in a metal crate on the back of a truck.\n\nRamba was accompanied by GSE chief Scott Blais as well as a veterinarian, volunteers and Brazilian federal police.\n\n\u201cRamba needs a quiet place, one where she feels safe and is not on display, where she is surrounded by others of her kind who truly understand her and can help her to open her heart fully,\u201d Blais said in a statement.\n\n\u201cShe needs sanctuary.\u201d", "description": "Chapada dos Guimar\u00e3es (Brazil) (AFP) \u2013 An Asian elephant that spent decades performing in South American circuses has started a new life in an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/aae68e_an-elephant-named-ramba-perform-in-circuses-rests-arriving-brazilian-elephant-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
