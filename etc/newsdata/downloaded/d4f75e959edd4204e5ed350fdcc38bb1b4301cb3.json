Many of them have been teens; according to the Centers for Disease Control, one in five high schoolers uses e-cigarettes. The cases have stumped doctors and public-health officials, who were already struggling to get young people to stop vaping.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the recent outbreak of vaping-related illnesses.\n\nHow many cases have been reported?\n\nYesterday, the Washington Post reported that 354 possible cases of vaping-related lung illnesses had been reported in 29 states, which is nearly twice as many as the CDC reported last week.\n\nHow severe are the symptoms?\n\nMany patients report difficulty breathing, as well as chest pain, vomiting, and other symptoms. According to the New York Times, in the most serious cases, patients have had extensive lung damage that required days on a ventilator, and will likely result in permanent lung damage.\n\nLast Friday, the first vaping-related death was reported in Illinois. At a news conference held last week, the CDC said that the patient, who remains anonymous, was an adult who had succumbed to severe respiratory illness after vaping.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing the illnesses?\n\nAccording to officials, the link between vaping and respiratory illness still isn\u2019t fully understood. The CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and state health agencies say they are still tracing common factors that may have caused the outbreak.\n\nHowever, many patients reported using products that contained THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana, leading some to suspect that cannabis oil may be to blame. Ray Niaura, a professor of public health at NYU, told USA Today that he doubted the recent outbreak is linked to e-cigarettes that have been on the market for a long time. More likely, \u201cpeople are vaping a lot of other things besides nicotine, such as synthetic cannabis or contaminated THC that is making an appearance and leading to these bad consequences,\u201d Niaura said.\n\nOthers have suggested that counterfeit vapes, or commercial nicotine pods that have been emptied and filled with THC oil, flavors, or other substances may be linked to the mysterious illnesses.\n\nWhat\u2019s being done to prevent further outbreaks?\n\nOn Thursday, after 16 people in Wisconsin were hospitalized with chemical pneumonia from vaping, the City of Milwaukee urged residents to stop using vapes, e-cigarettes, and liquid THC products immediately. Earlier this week, the California branch of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws warned consumers not to buy THC vape products from unlicensed retailers.\n\nDixie Harris, a pulmonologist in Salt Lake City, told USA Today that she advises people to avoid vaping THC products and other oils. \u201cIf somebody is going to insist on vaping, use the products that are from a reputable place and don\u2019t add extra material,\u201d she said.\n\nStay in touch.
