Because in times of emergency people rely on gov't for up-to-date information, and the reassurance that the people in charge know what they're doing. This was absolutely BOTCHED this time. This President took a simple mistake ... corrected within 20 minutes by the relevant agency (NWS) ... and escalated it over a week of press conferences, tweets, falsified maps, and officials and agencies contradicting other officials and agencies of HIS administration. And now it evolved into wholesale RETALIATION against that agency for DARING to embarrass the President! This is NOT how gov't should work. This is NOT about the President's fragile ego ... this is about people needing gov't to work with some degree of *competence* and *integrity* in times of emergency or crisis.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
