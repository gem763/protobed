A 201bhp PHEV model, as well as Golfs powered by natural gas, will be made available abroad, though there are currently no plans to bring any of these to the UK.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want a hybrid, you\u2019ll be able to choose from two three-cylinder petrol engines, of 89bhp and 109bhp, and there\u2019ll also be two four-cylinder diesels, in a sign that Volkswagen still has faith in the fuel despite declining sales, rated at 113bhp and 148bhp.\n\nInside, the Golf will feature a radically different interior dominated by a 10-inch touchscreen, which will come as standard on every model, as will a virtual instrument cluster that replaces the dials ahead of the driver with a second screen.", "description": "The new Volkswagen Golf was revealed this evening at Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg.", "authors": ["Alex Robbins", "Paul Hudson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000213683943-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8ZaqQgNRMD-O4rkKR7mXQqntdmLJQ18W5ucCSm2MdPQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
