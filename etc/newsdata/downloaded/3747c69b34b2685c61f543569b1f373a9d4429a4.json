(Tim Carman/The Washington Post)\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nThe only thing missing from the video, it seemed, was the Pied Piper, leading all the rats to the Dupont Circle pizzeria in Washington.\n\nBut something else was AWOL from the video, too: a time stamp, an omission that makes Halil Sarica smell a rat. And not one at his Dupont Pizza shop on P Street NW, which was shut down by health officials on Thursday after a video of rodents running loose in his kitchen went viral.\n\nATTN: PLEASE stay tf away from \u201cDuPont Pizza\u201d on P st NW pic.twitter.com/G1LdpR1zxV \u2014 BigSavannah Die$eL (@Diesel_2244) October 3, 2019\n\nFirst posted to Facebook on Wednesday, the video soon made the hyper-jump to Twitter and Instagram, where it has been watched thousands of times. Hundreds of thousands of times, in fact. Fox 5 ran a story on the video, too. Viewers all saw the same jaw-dropping spectacle: a carnival of rats scurrying across the floor, presumably in recent days at Dupont Pizza. By my unofficial count, there were at least 16 rodents having a hoedown inside the shop.\n\nThe outrage machine quickly went into overdrive, and the video eventually made its way to the D.C. Health Department, which sent an inspector to Dupont Pizza on Thursday. The inspector dinged the shop for a handful of mostly minor violations, including no soap or paper towels at the hand-washing sink, a dirty can opener and \u201ctwo dead roaches,\u201d according to the inspection report.\n\n\u201cThere were no indications of rat droppings or anything inside the establishment,\u201d said Alison Reeves, a spokeswoman for the health department.\n\nStill, inspectors shut down Dupont Pizza for, according to the report, \u201cno hot water and operating a food establishment with circumstances that may endanger public health.\u201d Sarica was on the phone with health officials on Friday, trying to arrange a follow-up inspection so that he could reopen his business. (The inspector arrived Friday afternoon, and Dupont Pizza is back in business.)\n\nHe was also pressing his case that he\u2019s the victim of revenge. On Monday, Sarica said, he fired an employee. On Tuesday, the fired employee received his last check from the pizzeria. On Wednesday, the video started making the rounds on social media. The video\u2019s first posting may have come from someone related to, or close to, the fired employee, Sarica said. The woman who posted the video to Facebook on Wednesday added this note: \u201cI was just sent this from the now former manager of DUPONT PIZZA in P st DC next to Subways. Please do not go here He is telling me to spread the word about this!!\u201d\n\nSarica, who singled out this video as the first to hit social media, said that the poster erroneously called the fired employee a \u201cmanager.\u201d He was not. The poster also did not respond to a pair of interview requests sent via Messenger.\n\n\n\nThe video on Sarica\u2019s phone, with a dateline of July 2, 2016. (Tim Carman/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cHe took it as an opportunity to start something,\u201d said Sarica about the fired employee. \u201cIt\u2019s something like evil.\u201d\n\nThe owner said the video dates back at least three years, and maybe longer. Someone connected to the fired employee sent what appears to be the original video to Sarica, who showed it to me on his phone: It has a dateline of July 2, 2016, which may or may not be when it was actually recorded.\n\nSarica said that, yes, the shop did have troubles with rats years ago, though he said he never saw the rodents personally. But he said he pays a pest control service to sweep his premises monthly. He showed me the work orders and invoices on his phone. His last few D.C. Health Department inspection reports also show no violations for rat droppings or any sign of an infestation.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, D.C. has always had rat problems,\u201d Sarica said. \u201cThe thing is how you control them.\u201d\n\nIf he had something to hide, the owner said, he would have closed the doors once the video reached peak outrage on Thursday. But he didn\u2019t. He remained open to \u201cexplain what happened, as much as we can.\u201d He also knew that the health department would come knocking, and he wanted to prove his case to the inspector.\n\nSarica declined to say how much business he\u2019s lost. He\u2019s more worried about losing something bigger: his reputation. \u201cI believe the trust with the public and the customers is more important than the business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pizza shop owner said he\u2019s going to talk to his attorney about litigation against the former employee. Does the shop owner have a case?\n\nDavid Cashdan, a partner at the firm Cashdan and Kane, said he wasn\u2019t up to date on Washington defamation law, but he noted that there\u2019s nothing illegal about registering a complaint with the health department, if in fact inspectors first learned about the case from the fired employee. But a person who disseminates false or misleading videos on social media could be liable to charges of slander, defamation or business interference.\n\n\u201cThere may be value in a business owner\u2019s fighting back whether there\u2019s a legal grounding or not,\u201d Cashdan added.\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nA new survey about American breakfast preferences is stuck in the past\n\nOvi O\u2019s is a nod to an era when cold cereal was the \u2018breakfast of champions\u2019\n\nTo David Chang, the \u2018ethnic\u2019 food aisle is racist.
