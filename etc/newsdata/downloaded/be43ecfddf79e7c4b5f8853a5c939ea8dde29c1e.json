It was a 12 o\u2019clock game, last game of the season, we\u2019ve already clinched a wild-card spot, so I\u2019m sure you guys can imagine where our minds are at,\u201d Roark said.\n\nWith their attention already on the AL wild-card game, the A\u2019s dropped the regular season finale in a 3-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Sunday. Kyle Seager hit a two-run homer in the first inning, promising prospect Kyle Lewis added an RBI single and the Mariners headed into the offseason with a victory.\n\nMeanwhile, Oakland finished 97-65 for the second straight year and rested most of its regular starters ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s AL wild-card game at home against Tampa Bay. The A\u2019s lost the wild-card game last year at the New York Yankees.\n\n\u201cSame record, different way of doing it,\u201d Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cFor the most part it\u2019s the same group, but again at the trade deadline we bring in some guys that are really impactful for us, some younger guys came up and are right now and will continue to be with this team for a long time. We did it a little bit differently on the pitching end. The offense was pretty consistent. We hit some home runs and we played great defense. So all that adds up to 97 wins.\u201d\n\nIn the first year of what it hopes is a quick rebuild, Seattle finished 68-94, a 21-game drop from last year\u2019s 89-win team.\n\nSeager missed the first two months of the season with a hand injury and struggled when he returned in late May. But the former All-Star rebounded to finish the year with 23 home runs and 63 RBIs. Seager\u2019s homer off Roark (4-3) was his first since Sept. 10.\n\nIt was a challenging season for Seager, who ended up being one of the few vets surrounded by a lot of inexperienced youth.\n\n\u201cGoing on the DL for the first time wasn\u2019t ideal, wasn\u2019t great, didn\u2019t love it, obviously,\u201d Seager said. \u201cIt was a different experience for me to sit back and watch for a little bit. It gets the juices flowing, it gets you hungry again and something you could spin into a positive.\u201d\n\nLewis, who shined during his late-season call-up hitting six home runs in his first 10 games, lined a two-out single in the fifth after Austin Nola had doubled.\n\nThe A\u2019s had just three hits as Seattle used a variety of young arms to close out the season. Justin Dunn was impressive in his two innings and Reggie McClain (1-1) got the victory, including a key groundout from Stephen Piscotty with runners on second and third to end the third inning.\n\nThe Mariners got a key defensive play on J.P. Crawford\u2019s leaping catch on Robbie Grossman\u2019s line drive to end the fifth inning and save a run.\n\nAnthony Bass pitched the ninth for his fifth save.\n\nDUNN DEAL\n\nDunn was used mostly in short stints as a starter in his four outings for the Mariners, but the last three showed great promise. Dunn threw six scoreless innings allowing two hits and striking out five over his final three outings against Pittsburgh, Houston and Oakland.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason I wanted to get up here was to get my feet wet and go into the offseason knowing I belong here. I feel like I did that my last two times out and hang my hat on that,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nALL 162\n\nOakland SS Marcus Semien made only a brief appearance on the final day but managed to play in all 162 games this season. Semien led off the game with a pop out before being lifted.\n\nSemien finished the regular season hitting .285 with 33 home runs and 92 RBIs. He appeared in 159 games twice previously in his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of fun with this in the last day. Give him 161 and cut him off but that\u2019s not going to happen. So we\u2019ll get him an at-bat today. He deserves it,\u201d A\u2019s manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nNO STARTER YET\n\nMelvin said he doesn\u2019t intend to announce a starter for the wild-card game until Tuesday\u2019s workout day.\n\nDOWN AT HOME\n\nIn part because of their rebuild, the Mariners saw a significant drop in attendance. Seattle drew 16,851 for the finale and finished the year unofficially at 1,791,895 fans for its 81 home games. A year ago, the Mariners drew 2,300,177.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nSeattle OF Mitch Haniger hopes to resume his normal offseason workouts in the next couple of weeks. Haniger has not played since early June after suffering a ruptured testicle. He suffered a back injury during his rehab and it was the back problem that ultimately caused him to miss the rest of the season. Haniger said he doesn\u2019t anticipate any restrictions when spring training begins.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAthletics: Will host Tampa Bay in the AL wild-card game on Wednesday.\n\nMariners: Will open the 2020 season on March 26 hosting Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tanner Roark seemed to describe perfectly the approach of the playoff-bound Oakland Athletics on the final day of the regular season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/athletics_mariners_baseball_09292_c0-188-4493-2807_s1770x1032.jpg?0a21a52cef25df6d45ff61f0e5af784c70681f54", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
