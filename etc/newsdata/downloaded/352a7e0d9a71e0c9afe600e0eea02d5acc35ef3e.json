None of the drugs examined showed evidence of improved safety or effectiveness, the analysis found.\n\nThe report looked at the seven top-selling drugs by sales revenue that had price increases of more than two times inflation, as measured by the medical consumer price index.\n\nThe culprits, and how much they added to drug spending over two years:\n\nHumira: $1.9 billion\n\nRituxan: $806 million\n\nLyrica: $688 million\n\nTruvada: $550 million\n\nNeulasta: $489 million\n\nCialis: $403 million\n\nTecfidera: $313 million\n\nRead more here.\n\nIn other drug pricing news...\n\nBlue Dog Dems call for more votes on bipartisan drug pricing bills\n\nThe moderate Blue Dog Democrats are calling on House Democratic leaders to hold standalone votes on several smaller, bipartisan drug pricing bills, not just the sweeping measure put forward by Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiEx-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Former George W. Bush chief of staff endorses Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.).\n\nThe Blue Dogs also want votes on bills to encourage competition from cheaper generic drugs, such as:\n\nThe Creates Act to crack down on brand-name drug companies blocking cheaper generics from coming to market.\n\n\"Pay for delay\" legislation to prevent brand-name drug companies from paying generic companies to delay introducing competition.\n\nThe bigger picture: The Blue Dogs are not objecting to Pelosi's signature legislation at this point. But they also want to have some bipartisan wins, and they think smaller measures are more likely to be signed into law.\n\nSTD rates hit record high in 2018\n\nRates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) reached a record high in 2018, resulting in more babies born with syphilis, according to a report released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nCombined cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia increased for the fifth consecutive year, partly due to cuts to STD programs at the state and local levels and decreased condom use among young people and gay and bisexual men, the CDC said. STD rates were highest in southern states including Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi, and rural areas like Alaska and South Dakota.\n\nMore than 1,306 babies were born with syphilis last year, a 40 percent increase from 2017. That parallels with an increase in syphilis among women of childbearing age.\n\nMoney issues: The reasons vary, but the most common come down to money.\n\nMany STD clinics that were effective at treating diseases closed during the 2007-2009 recession and never reopened. Local health departments are also increasingly short-staffed. If state governments are strapped for money, public health funds are often the first to be cut.\n\nPush for more funding: Public health groups have sounded the alarm on increasing STD rates for years. The National Coalition of STD Directors is urging Congress to increase funding for STD prevention services by $70 million, calling it the \"bare minimum\" it will take the CDC to support an effective response to an ongoing public health crisis. The government funding bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House included an increase in funding for STD services, but it's unclear if the Senate bill will follow suit.\n\nRead more here\n\nMontana to temporarily ban e-cigarette sales\n\nMontana is placing a temporary ban on the sale of e-cigarette flavors in the wake of rising youth vaping addictions and a vaping-related lung disease linked to at least 18 deaths nationwide.\n\nGov.
