This holiday season, get a robot vacuum to do the most tedious chore. Plus, you don't even have to spend too much to get a great one.

(Photo: RavPower)\n\nIf you have a car and a phone, you should have a charger to make sure you don't wind up lost late at night with no way to find your way home. We've tested a lot of options and found that this one from RAVPower is the best car charger you can get. Bonus, it's under $10 and usually costs $8, but you can save an extra $1 if you get it now. That's basically the same as a couple gallons of gas. We liked its low-profile design and its metal body that makes it feel sturdier than plastic models.\n\nGet the RAVPower Mini Dual USB Car Charger for $6.99 (Save $1)\n\n3. Save up to $45: The best Kindle e-reader\n\nAny reader would appreciate a shiny, new Kindle. (Photo: Reviewed / Michael Roorda)\n\nIf you love to read but don't do enough of it, perhaps an e-reader can make your books more accessible. The Kindle Paperwhite is the best option out there, especially now that it's waterproof and has 8GB of storage (the previous generation only had 4GB), and right now it's $40 off. You can also get the 32GB version for $45 off, but honestly 8GB is going to be more than enough for all the books and magazines you are actively reading. You can always add and remove titles from your device and they'll stay in the cloud if you want to reread them.\n\n4. Under $17: Two ways to brighten your smile\n\nYou can try to whiten your teeth two ways with these Amazon deals. (Photo: AsaVeda / ActiveWow)\n\nUnless you're rich and/or famous, you probably don't have infinite funds for cosmetic dentistry. But there at at-home options to help brighten your smile, and two of the most popular are both on sale right now. ActiveWow charcoal powder has a serious cult following, and you can get the typically $20 toothpaste powder for $17 with the on-page coupon. Brushing with this may help remove some of the surface buildup that could be contributing to discoloration, but it is abrasive so talk to your dentist first to make sure it's OK for your teeth.\n\nIf it's not, maybe check out these highly rated teeth whitening pens that claim to let you paint your teeth whiter. Each pen in the two-pack has 20 or so uses, and they claim you can see results after daily application. As with the charcoal powder, the results are not guaranteed, but for $17 instead of $20, it can't hurt to try it!\n\n5. Under $50: A portable jump starter for your car\n\nNext time your car battery dies, you won't need to call for help if this is in your trunk. (Photo: Anker)\n\nNothing's more annoying than a dead car battery when you have to get to work, except when there's no one around to give you a jump This portable jump starter lets you get your engine back up and running without a second vehicle, and right now it's only $50 thanks to an on-page $10 coupon and the coupon code R1JS400A. You'll get 15 jumps from a single charge, and when the battery runs out, you can recharge it and use it again! Plus, it's got a flashlight built in for late-night jumps and you can use it to charge your phone in a pinch. For such a steep discount, there's no reason to NOT get one and keep it in your trunk for emergencies.\n\nGet the Roav Jump Starter by Anker for $49.99 (Save $30) with the code \"R1JS400A\" and the on-page coupon\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
