When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check,\u201d Taylor told investigators.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Ambassador Sondland said \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTaylor also said he learned from two other officials that the order to hold security assistance for Ukraine came from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyTrump urges GOP to fight for him Bill Press: Mulvaney proves need for daily briefings Gingrich calls for eliminating White House press corps in wake of Mulvaney briefing MORE.\n\nTaylor first drew the attention of lawmakers when former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerPutin, Hungarian leader pushed Trump on Ukraine corruption narrative: reports Diplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe Overnight Energy: Watchdog warns of threats to federal workers on public lands | Perry to step down on December 1 | Trump declines to appear in Weather Channel climate special MORE provided text messages to House investigators that quoted Taylor as saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nHe stood by that assessment in his opening statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI believed that then, and I still believe that,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any quid pro quo.\n\nStill, Taylor\u2019s testimony comes just days after Mulvaney said aid for Ukraine was linked to Trump\u2019s desire for the country to pursue a political probe related to the 2016 election. He later walked back the remarks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the four weeks since Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 Four companies reach 0M settlement in opioid lawsuit | Deal opens door to larger settlements | House panel to consider vaping tax | Drug pricing markup tomorrow Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails Trump urges GOP to fight for him MORE (D-Calif.) formally announced the impeachment inquiry, Democrats have secured closed-door testimony from a number of witnesses who have detailed Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rivals.\n\nDemocrats say there are still more witnesses they want to interview before turning to the next phase of impeachment: public hearings, releasing transcripts and making recommendations for how to proceed before reaching a floor vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nAt least two more witnesses are scheduled to appear this week: Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper and acting Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Reeker.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees are leading the impeachment probe. Any public hearings are likely weeks away.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s obviously a step after this.

But I hope that it doesn\u2019t take excessively long, because it\u2019s going to run right into the election,\u201d said freshman Rep. Jefferson Van Drew (D-N.J.), who said it would be ideal for the inquiry to wrap up before the Iowa caucuses in early February.\n\nRep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who represents a deep-blue district outside of Washington, also has concerns that the impeachment probe could drag on too long.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going as fast as it can, responsibly, ethically,\u201d Beyer told The Hill. \u201cBut I think getting it done sooner rather than later is really important for us, because we have so many other things that we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to interfere too much with the 2020 election. It\u2019s not up to me, but I would just assume [an impeachment vote] would happen before we leave for the Christmas break this year,\u201d he said.\n\nOther freshmen in competitive districts are resigned to an investigation that could drag on for months.\n\n\u201cI have four hearings today. And yet every question I\u2019ve gotten is about impeachment and the inquiry. So it\u2019s already overshadowing all of the other great work that we\u2019re doing, unfortunately,\u201d Rep.

And it\u2019s our responsibility to be driven by facts and not anything else.\u201d\n\nWhen Pelosi first endorsed the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, many House Democrats believed it might wrap up by Thanksgiving. Lawmakers now say the widening probe could last beyond the holiday season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it doesn\u2019t go into January,\u201d said Rep.
