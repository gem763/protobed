It's not what PM Theresa May expected when she called this election six weeks ago to strengthen her hand ahead of the formal Brexit negotiations \u2014 and the result might mean more political chaos for the country in the near future.\n\nWhere things stand right now:\n\nMay will remain as PM with a minority government headed by her Conservative Party. The Conservatives are discussing a pact with the right-wing Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, but there is no formal coalition agreement yet.\n\nAfter facing down a no-confidence vote triggered by his own MPs last year, this result is a huge success for the Labour Party's Jeremy Corbyn and his brand of left-wing politics.\n\nBrexit is still on \u2014 the European Union has already begun trolling May \u2014 but its ultimate scope and structure is certainly in question.\n\nOther big storylines\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP), the main driver behind the Scottish independence movement, lost seats all across Scotland to the other major parties. Conservative gains in Scotland provided the most shocking result, as the party hasn't had any success there in 20 years. Scottish independence is on life support right now.\n\nLabour's Corbyn had been widely mocked and derided (even by those in his own party) as an out-of-touch socialist from the 1970s. But his hopeful message and dynamic campaigning clearly resonated with voters across the country as Labour made headway even in longtime Conservative bastions.\n\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats was defeated in a surprise result. And the SNP lost both its deputy leader and former leader as Angus Robertson and Alex Salmond both lost their seats in Scotland.\n\nWhat comes next", "description": "Make elections normal again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/4REYLC6P-29eGLJgsCdytsSV0r4=/1920x1080/smart/2017/12/15/1513302881787.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-15"}
