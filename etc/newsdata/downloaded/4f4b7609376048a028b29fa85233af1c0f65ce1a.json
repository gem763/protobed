This upgrade is made possible by a change in the screen tech on the Apple Watch, and we\u2019re going to explain how it works.\n\nFirst though, a brief history of the smart timepiece: The first Apple Watch appeared, you may remember, back in 2015, and it was... not fantastic. It came with an excellent OLED screen and impressed in terms of hardware design, but we found it laggy, fiddly to use and slow \u2014 and that includes the time it took for the clock to appear when you raised your wrist to look at it.\n\nAfter all, isn\u2019t that the primary job of a watch? To tell the time? You can make the argument that a flick of the wrist isn\u2019t too strenuous an exercise for seeing what hour of the day it is, but it\u2019s often when your hands are busy doing something else \u2014 driving a car, riding the subway, washing the dishes\u2014when you need to take a glance at the time.\n\nEither that, or you need to check the time surreptitiously. When you\u2019re chatting in a bar or sitting in a meeting, it\u2019s not the best form to raise your wrist in front of you to wake up the Apple Watch display \u2014 people will inevitably think you\u2019ve got somewhere better to be.\n\nOf the upgrades we\u2019ve seen to the Apple Watch since 2015, very few of them have involved the display, which has stayed largely unchanged until now. We\u2019ve seen cellular connectivity added, improvements in speed and performance, and more and more watch faces, but the design hasn\u2019t been modified much at all.\n\nImage: Gizmodo\n\nThe brightness got bumped up with the \u201csecond-generation\u201d OLED display in the Apple Watch Series 2, but the screen size and technology didn\u2019t really shift until last year\u2019s Apple Watch Series 4. That wearable bumped up the screen sizes to 40mm and 44mm (from 38mm and 42mm), as well as introducing the display tech that the always-on feature now takes advantage of: LTPO OLED.\n\nThat\u2019s right: The killer feature of the Apple Watch 5 was actually built into the Apple Watch 4 too, but Apple didn\u2019t take full advantage of it. Presumably, that\u2019s because battery life wasn\u2019t efficient enough, or there was some technical hurdle that meant the technology couldn\u2019t be fully utilised until 2019, or Apple needed to refine the hardware further.\n\nWhatever the reason, it\u2019s here now thanks to something called LTPO \u2014 Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide, or in Apple\u2019s case, low-temperature polysilicon and oxide (a special, bespoke variation developed by Apple).\n\nWhile Apple hasn\u2019t gone into too much detail about how the screen on the Apple Watch 5 is put together, the fine folks at iFixit have provided an excellent explainer: Like every display, this one is made up of layers, including the pixels themselves and the circuitry controlling them (known as backplanes).\n\nWhat Apple is actually doing here is mixing two different types of screen circuitry technology and getting the benefits from both. First, there\u2019s low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS), the power-efficient tech found in many top-end OLED phone backplanes (including iPhones), which essentially controls whether a pixel is on or off.\n\nSecond, we have the more innovative Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) technology, which dictates the voltage supplied to each pixel, its brightness, and the particular mix of red, green and blue it\u2019s using for its colour. IGZO circuitry is already used in some Apple products, including iPads and MacBooks.\n\nOne of the end results is a variable refresh rate, as low as 1Hz (one refresh per second). Obviously that\u2019s not enough to keep the second hand moving, but it is enough to tell you what the time is and how many steps you\u2019ve done in a day. That lower refresh rate reduces power draw too, and combined with the dimmed brightness, the all-day battery life can be preserved.\n\nImage: Gizmodo\n\nIt\u2019s something that Apple has done before; the feature is implemented in a different way than the Apple Watch, but the iPad Pros feature ProMotion technology, able to change the refresh rate on the fly to improve responsiveness or to save energy.\n\nThe excellent power efficiency of LTPS, plus the way that IGZO handles lower display frequencies very well, is what helps make the Apple Watch 5 display special. Of course, it\u2019s easier to do this sort of display circuitry manipulation on a smaller scale, so it might be some time before it appears in Apple\u2019s phones and tablets.\n\nLTPO isn\u2019t working alone, according to Apple. \u201cSeveral advanced technologies work together to deliver this new feature, including the industry\u2019s only low-temperature polysilicon and oxide display (LTPO), ultra-low power display driver, efficient power management integrated circuit and new ambient light sensor,\u201d the company explained\n\nIt\u2019s a combination of these technologies that make the always-on display possible and enable it to go beyond what the LPTO-sporting Apple Watch 4 was able to do. As iFixit points out, space is also a consideration\u2014anything that Apple does to improve the performance or functionality of its wearable has to fit inside the chassis dimensions that are being imposed.\n\nAs a note from last year by analysts IHS Markit explains, LTPO does have its challenges, including manufacturing complications and problems ramping up the resolution to be as high as it is with standard LTPS (IGZO-free) displays. Ultimately though, the investment could well be worth it in terms of energy efficiency \u2014 and Apple is likely to have at least one eye on folding displays further down the line.", "description": "The Apple Watch Series 5 is the first of Apple\u2019s smartwatches to come with an always-on display, so you no longer need to lift your wrist to see what the time is \u2014 one of the few features that Google\u2019s Wear OS got first.
