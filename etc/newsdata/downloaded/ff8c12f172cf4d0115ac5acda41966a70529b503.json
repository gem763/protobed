The rules required large companies to provide the government with data on employee pay broken down by gender, race and ethnicity.\n\nThe Trump administration has been resisting those rules, arguing they would be too onerous for businesses. The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to the EEOC in 2017 saying it was freezing the data collection. Earlier this year, a court ordered the administration to start complying with the rules and collect the data for the years 2017 and 2018.\n\nBut the current EEOC \u2015 an independent agency that now has a 2-1 Republican majority \u2015 has apparently decided to drop the requirements, meaning employers probably won\u2019t have to report the data for 2019 and thereafter.\n\nThe latest development was made possible by Trump\u2019s Senate-confirmed appointment to the agency. The EEOC is now chaired by Janet Dhillon, a Trump nominee confirmed by the Senate on a 50-43 vote in May. Dhillon is a former general counsel for Burlington Stores and JCPenney.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said in a statement that the EEOC was helping to \u201csweep pay discrimination under the rug.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to address the wage gap that leaves so many women and people of color being paid less for doing the same work as others,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd let me be clear: You don\u2019t solve problems by hiding them and you don\u2019t fight for workers by shielding corporations from accountability.\u201d\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Law Center, which sued to preserve the Obama-era rules, called the EEOC\u2019s decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now know that Trump\u2019s newly constituted EEOC leadership is planning to abandon its own mission to ensure equality, including equal pay, in the workplace,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t fight for workers by shielding corporations from accountability. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.)\n\nInformation released by the Census Bureau just last week showed that the gender pay gap hasn\u2019t budged over the past year. Women now earn, on average, 82% of what white men make. The numbers are significantly worse for black women (62%) and Latinas (54%)\n\nThe gap has only closed by four percentage points since 2007, when women made, on average, 78% of what men then earned.\n\nThe EEOC rules established during the Obama years applied to companies with more than 100 workers. Collecting such data is regarded as a crucial step in closing the pay gaps among demographic groups, offering a more precise look at the types of jobs and industries where the disparities are widest. Forcing companies to confront pay disparities could have the effect of pushing them to fix them.\n\nA similar effort in the U.K. has highlighted some huge gaps in a variety of industries.\n\nWhite House aide and first daughter Ivanka Trump, who touts herself as a \u2018feminist,\u2019 drew criticism in 2017 when she announced her opposition to the pay collection effort.\n\n\u201cUltimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,\u201d Ivanka Trump said at the time.\n\nOnly a few months earlier, on Equal Pay Day, she had tweeted that the day is \u201ca reminder that women deserve equal pay for equal work. We must work to close the gender pay gap!\u201d", "description": "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission doesn't want to require large employers to provide data on pay detailed by race, gender.", "authors": ["Labor Reporter", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d792cf43b00002b88d0cf3d.jpeg?cache=z9k8akbtdm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
