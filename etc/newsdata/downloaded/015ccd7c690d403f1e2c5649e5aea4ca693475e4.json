By the end, you will thank the media for demanding the release of Trump\u2019s phone calls with the presidents of Ukraine and Australia.\n\nWhat the phone transcripts demonstrate is that \u2014 unlike the typical Republican \u2014 Trump is not a let-bygones-be-bygones sort. He intends to find out who turned the FBI into a Hillary super PAC, using the powers of the nation\u2019s \u201cpremiere law enforcement agency\u201d (according to them) to take out a presidential candidate, and then a president.\n\nThe whole picture becomes clear when you have the timeline.\n\nInstead of the FBI just admitting that it launched the Russia probe to help elect Hillary, the agency has given us a scrolling series of excuses for this partisan attack.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s first claim was that it was merely investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email servers. As part of that effort, it was, naturally, obligated to spy on the Trump campaign.\n\nThen we found out that the John le Carre theory of Hillary\u2019s defeat was based exclusively on the word of a single cybersecurity firm. Yes, the FBI was SO frantic about the DNC\u2019s servers\u2026 that it didn\u2019t bother examining them itself. I repeat: The FBI never touched the DNC\u2019s servers.\n\nAnd who did? CrowdStrike. Who was CrowdStrike? A Ukrainian-backed cybersecurity firm.\n\nThat\u2019s why Trump asked the Ukrainian president about CrowdStrike \u2013- the company behind the first of the FBI\u2019s many excuses for spying on Trump.\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2017 \u2014 before Trump was even inaugurated \u2014 FBI Director James Comey breathed new life into the Russian collusion story by leaking news about the infamous Russian \u201cdossier.\u201d\n\nHurray! The media were ecstatic. For the next 10 months, we got breathless reports about how this very important, totally credible, deeply concerning dossier might force Trump out of the White House!\n\nE.g.:\n\n\u2014 \u201cI remember pretty distinctly that you supported President Trump\u2019s criticism of this dossier\u2026 Do you want to dial back that criticism now ?\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan to former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, April 19, 2017\n\n\u2014 \u201cIf the dossier is now about to be publicly defended and explained and backed up, I mean, that\u2019s conceivably the whole ball game.\u201d \u2014 MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Aug. 23, 2017\n\nAfter carrying on about the dossier for nearly all of 2017, on Oct. 24 of that year, we finally found out who had paid for it: the Hillary Clinton campaign. (And you wonder why they don\u2019t want to give us the whistleblower\u2019s name.)\n\nThis rather important datum was coughed up not by the media, but only in response to a court order. Good work, \u201cwatchdog media\u201d! Nothing gets past you guys.\n\nSuddenly the dossier wasn\u2019t important at all. Where did Republicans get that idea?\n\nAt this point, the FBI had to scramble to come up with an all-new explanation for why the bureau had put more than 100 agents \u2014 according to NBC News\u2019 Ken Dilanian \u2013- on an investigation of a presidential candidate. (Luckily, the bureau had lots of time, having already vanquished international terrorism.)\n\nWithin a matter of days, on Oct. 30, the media was bristling with the news that the real reason the FBI put G-Men on the Trump campaign was: George Papadopoulos.\n\n(Don\u2019t stop reading! The sun is about to come out and all will be clear.)\n\nUp until Oct. 24, the media had barely mentioned the young campaign aide. But starting on Oct. 30, Papadopoulos became the lynchpin of the whole Trump-Russia conspiracy.\n\nIt was a heavy lift. Papadopoulos had only met Trump once and, as The New York Times admitted, was \u201cso green that he listed Model United Nations in his qualifications.\u201d\n\nA few months later, in December 2017, the Russian collusion fairy tale took a hit when texts from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page showed FBI operatives at the heart of the so-called \u201cinvestigation\u201d vowing to use federal law enforcement resources to \u201cstop\u201d Trump.\n\nThe FBI began frantically pumping up the Papadopoulos angle, telling the Times that it was their gob-smacking discovery in the summer of 2016 that Papadopoulos may have had \u201cinside information\u201d about Russia \u201chacking\u201d the DNC\u2019s email that was a \u201cdriving factor\u201d in the bureau\u2019s opening of the Russia-Trump investigation.\n\nSo THAT\u2019S why the nation\u2019s No. 1 law enforcement agency had 100 agents investigating the Trump campaign! It sure took them a long time to come up with a reason.\n\nPending results from Trump\u2019s phone call with the Australian president, Papadopoulos remains the FBI\u2019s current excuse for an \u201cinvestigation\u201d that wasted four years, millions of dollars and, in the end, turned up nada.\n\nThe story was, in the summer of 2016, Australian high commissioner to the United Kingdom Alexander Downer contacted the FBI claiming that Papadopoulos had admitted to him during a night of drinking that he knew the Russians had Hillary\u2019s emails. Two months later, Wikileaks began posting the DNC\u2019s emails!\n\nHOW ELSE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT, UNLESS TRUMP WAS COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA?\n\nI can explain it.\n\nWhen Papadopoulos was blabbing to the Australian about the Russians having Hillary\u2019s emails, everyone was talking about the Russians having Hillary\u2019s emails \u2014 CNN, The Guardian, even ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d (See Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind .) Papadopoulos\u2019 \u201csource\u201d probably read it in The New York Times.\n\nPerhaps Downer is always completely oblivious to international news. Perhaps he spends too much time drinking with 28-year-olds.\n\nTrump\u2019s phone call with the president of Australia, released this week, suggests that we just might get to the bottom of the big Alexander Downer tipoff \u2014 the FBI\u2019s latest cover story.\n\nNow you know why all of official Washington, D.C., is screaming: IMPEACH ! They don\u2019t want you to find out that America\u2019s \u201cpremiere law enforcement agency\u201d tried to throw a presidential election and destroy a presidency.", "description": "Ann Coulter writes: \"This column will explain the\u00a0impeachment\u00a0farce in two minutes.\"", "authors": ["Ann Coulter"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/05/coulter-headshot-640x480-640x480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
