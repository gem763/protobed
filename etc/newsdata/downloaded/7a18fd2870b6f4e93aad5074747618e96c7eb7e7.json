More than 80 other protesters were detained after him, a Reuters witness at the scene said.\n\nThe deputy head of the Baku police, Sakhlab Bagirov, confirmed to Reuters that some people had been detained, but declined to provide a number.\n\nPolice also cordoned off several streets in central Baku, a couple of metro stations were temporarily shut and there were problems with internet connection.\n\nAzerbaijan has been governed by President Ilham Aliyev since 2003 when he succeeded his late father.\n\nWestern nations have courted Azerbaijan because of its role as an alternative to Russia in supplying oil and gas to Europe, but various European bodies and rights groups have accused Aliyev of muzzling dissent and jailing opponents, charges Baku denies.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Nailia Bagirova; writing by Polina Devitt and Margarita Antidze; editing by Gareth Jones)", "description": "Police in Azerbaijan on Saturday detained scores of protesters, including the leader of the main opposition Popular Front, at the start of a planned rally against low salaries, corruption and a lack of democracy in the energy-rich ex-Soviet state.
