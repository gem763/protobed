Reuters\n\nWhile the responsibility for protecting users' private content should fall on the platform and not on the goodwill of followers, the fact is that the method discovered by BuzzFeed is an almost universal way to obtain all types of protected images.\n\nTechnology blogs such as BlogThinkBig and Techlandia have been talking about this process for several years, since all images uploaded to the web have an address that includes the jpg. or png. format.\n\nThe key to security is to make that address as difficult to locate as possible, according to Benjamin Mayo, an iOS developer, who has commented on the BuzzFeed story on Twitter.\n\nRead: Facebook and Instagram deliberately condition you to use your phone like a drug, says this app developer\n\nMayo believes that what BuzzFeed has dug up on Instagram and Facebook happens across several applications, including the likes of Google Photos.\n\n\"The protection is that the URLs have enough random complexity that you'd never be able to guess them,\" he explained.", "description": "By inspecting the images and videos on the feed of a private account, it's possible to access a public URL, which can be shared with anyone.", "authors": ["Ruqayyah Moynihan", "Ana Zarzalejos", "Business Insider Espa\u00f1a"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7bba452e22af128829f592-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
