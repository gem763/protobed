Companies in these cities pay top dollar to attract talent from across the country and around the world, thus contributing to skyrocketing living costs that are often well above what the typical American can afford.\n\nThe overall cost of living ranges from 18% to 28% higher than average in these cities. Housing can be particularly unaffordable, with rents costing at least 50% more on average.\n\nLiving in a major city, and benefiting from the concentration of jobs, amenities, and culture, does not have to break the bank, however. There are dozens of cities nationwide with a lower than average cost of living and with relatively affordable housing markets \u2013 and many of them are growing rapidly.\n\nUsing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 50 most affordable metropolitan areas Americans are moving to. In each of the metro areas on this list, the overall cost of living is lower than the national average, and typical housing costs are more in line with area incomes than average across all cities. Additionally, between 2010 and 2018, far more people have moved to these cities than have left.\n\nNot only are people moving to these cities, but many are also choosing to start families in these areas. About half of the cities on this list also reported higher than average natural population growth \u2013 meaning there were more births than deaths between 2010 and 2018.\n\n30 American ghost towns: ZIP codes where homes have vacated the most\n\nHow we ditched debt: Little splurges on the path to freedom\n\nAtlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA (Photo: Sean Pavone / Getty Images)\n\n50.

Of the 383 U.S. metro areas, we considered only those with a regional price parity \u2013 or cost of living \u2013 below the national average. Metro areas also had to have a housing affordability ratio \u2013 median home value divided by median annual household income \u2013 below the average ratio across all metro areas of 4.46. Finally, we ranked the 50 metro areas by the largest population growth due to net migration between 2010 and 2018.\n\nMedian household income and median home values are from the 2018 American Community Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau. July 1, 2018 population estimates and population change between 2010 and 2018 are from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program. Regional price parity, or cost of living, is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nPercentile ranks for median household income and median home value are provided for context and were calculated against all 383 U.S. metro areas.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
