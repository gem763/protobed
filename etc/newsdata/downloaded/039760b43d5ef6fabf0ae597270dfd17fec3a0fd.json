Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman who is leading the impeachment review, as guilty of treason or defamation for mocking Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Neither charge is valid.\n\nTrump also assailed the whistleblower complaint as improperly filed and \"dishonest,\" compared with a \"word for word\" transcript of the call. Actually, no exact transcript exists, and the acting director of national intelligence told Congress that he believed the whistleblower complaint was \"in alignment\" with a rough transcript released by the White House.\n\nTrump had a similar playbook to dispute the Russia investigation by assailing special counsel Robert Mueller as biased and saying the inquiry was illegally hatched by Democrats. Those charges have been shown to be untrue.\n\nMeanwhile, amid signs of manufacturing weakness , Trump unfairly pointed a finger of blame at the Federal Reserve rather than his escalating trade war with China, and overstated his role in a World Trade Organization ruling for the United States.\n\nA review:\n\nIMPEACHMENT\n\nTRUMP: \"As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the....People.\" \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: No illegal coup is afoot.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last month initiated impeachment proceedings against Trump. She accused him of abusing presidential powers by seeking help from a foreign government to undermine Democratic rival Joe Biden and help his own reelection. The move followed a complaint by a whistleblower, a CIA officer, who made the charges.\n\nA coup is usually defined as a sudden, violent and illegal seizure of government power. The impeachment process is laid out in the Constitution, giving Congress the authority to impeach and try a president as part of its responsibilities as a coequal branch of government to provide a check on a president when he or she commits treason, bribery, or \"other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nThe standard of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" is vague and open-ended to encompass abuses of power even if they aren't, strictly speaking, illegal.\n\n___\n\n2016 ELECTION\n\nTRUMP: \"The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone's time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306.\" \u2014 tweet Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump again misstates the Electoral College vote. The official count was 304 to 227, according to an Associated Press tally of the electoral votes in every state.\n\n___\n\nUKRAINE\n\nTRUMP: \"I had a transcript done by very, very talented people \u2014 word for word, comma for comma. ... We had an exact transcript. And when we produced that transcript, they died.\" \u2014 news conference Wednesday with Finland's president.\n\nTRUMP: \"They never thought in a million years that I'd release the conversation ... And this is an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation, right? Taken by very talented stenographers.\" \u2014 remarks Wednesday to reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nTHE FACTS: It's not a word-for-word transcript.\n\nThe memorandum of Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy itself makes clear that it does not represent an exact transcript of what was said.\n\nAccording to the document, it is \"not a verbatim transcript\" and instead \"records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record.\" It cited potential factors such as the quality of the phone connection, variations in accent \"and/or interpretation.\"\n\nNSC refers to the National Security Council.\n\nThe acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, told a House panel last month that he believed the whistleblower acted in \"good faith\" and the complaint was consistent with the White House's rough transcript.", "description": "Facing an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump is turning to a familiar playbook to defend himself: attacking his investigators , blasting the inquiry as illegal and deriding the process as all-but-rigged.
