Its collection includes movie stars, prime ministers, sporting heroes and trailblazers.\n\nQuinlan plans stand-alone exhibitions for Australian and overseas artists in the summer months, and wants to cooperate with and co-opt ideas from the world's other major portrait galleries \u2014 in London, Copenhagen, Edinburgh and Wellington.\n\nThe gallery reopened in September after a five-month closure. Almost every floor inside and outside the $87 million building needed major structural improvements, despite being just 10 years old.\n\nArtist Tom Roberts was among those advocating for a portrait collection as early as the 1900s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing lobbying from cultural leaders, John Howard opened the gallery after encountering an Australian tourist at the US National Portrait Gallery in Washington. It would be good to have \"one of these at home,\" the visitor told the then-prime minister.\n\n\"I think portraiture has that instant connection, an immediacy,\" Quinlan said.\n\n\"That recognition not only of a face that you know but of a face that you connect with. It can bring out many different emotions and reactions and can be very inspirational.\"\n\nKaren Quinlan inside the gallery's current Women in Vogue exhibition. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nHaving served on the boards of the National Gallery of Victoria, the State Library of Victoria and the Melbourne Fashion Festival, Quinlan knows her institution is a growing player, competing with bigger collections in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nNext door, the National Gallery of Australia has its own ambitious new director in Nick Mitzevich.\n\nCanberra's national institutions compete strongly for visitors and funding.\n\nQuinlan has added a new national portrait painting award, the Darling Prize, to the popular National Photographic Portrait Prize and wants to boost education and marketing offerings for future exhibitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs much as anything, she wants Australians to visit and to come back.\n\n\"The way I view my work is thinking about what's possible, what I can achieve and then I just go for it.\n\n\"That may mean that it's very ambitious, and not everything works.\n\n\"It's got to be representative and more than a photo album of the country. It's a celebration of all of the diversity within this nation and therefore the responsibility is huge.\"", "description": "With a reputation for securing blockbuster exhibitions, Karen Quinlan says international shows will add a new edge to Canberra's National Portrait Gallery.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2994%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_155%2C$y_432/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/035fd8349192ae12b87c99e4cb8aa76cc5115dc9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
