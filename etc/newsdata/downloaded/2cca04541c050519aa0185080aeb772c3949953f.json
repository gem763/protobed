Will he win?", "language": "en", "text": "What this suggests is we\u2019re entering an extended period of political theater. Democrats will cast Trump as an unstable lawbreaker whose erratic leadership threatens the country. Meanwhile, Republicans will deplore the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d (Trump\u2019s words) against a president who has fulfilled many of his 2016 campaign promises: perpetuating the economic recovery, overhauling trade policy and winding down prolonged wars.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis melodrama promises to be fascinating and, quite probably, demoralizing. Where will public opinion settle? Who knows? I have been writing a column continuously for 43 years, and I quickly learned that the textbook assumptions about democratic debate are naive.\n\nThe presumption is that we live in a rational world of high-minded discourse that leads to political consensus. The great virtue of democracy, in this view, is that it both leads to superior policies and ensures that those policies will enjoy public support.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not how the system works.\n\nOur debates unleash ferocious lobbying, expressions of narrow self-interest and exaggerated claims and counterclaims. The aspect that has always interested me the most is the practical difficulty in getting people to change their minds, even when circumstances and conditions shift. Once people take a position on something, they are not easily dislodged.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are reasons for this. People define themselves by their beliefs. It\u2019s who they are and want to be. Changing this means, to some extent, repudiating who they are. It\u2019s a time-consuming and emotionally draining process. For individuals, it implies that he or she was once wrong or, at least, not right. This may also be perceived as a sign of weakness. Given these realities, public opinion is often rigid.\n\nThis may work to Trump\u2019s advantage. As has been often noted, his \u201cbase\u201d has shown remarkable stability. His approval rating, according to The Washington Post-ABC News poll, has fluctuated in a narrow band, between 36 percent and 44 percent (the average is 39 percent) since April 2017. At least for his core supporters, Trump has seemed remarkably adept at controlling the narrative of his \u00adpresidency.\n\nOn the other hand, some views have shifted dramatically over time. Take same-sex marriage. In 1988, NORC at the University of Chicago asked on its survey whether gay people should have the right to marry. Only 12 percent agreed; by 2018, the figure was 68 percent. Yet as Tom W. Smith of NORC explains, \u201ca big part of that is generational change\u201d \u2014 not the same people altering their views but a younger, more diverse cohort with different views.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKarlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute notes that the legalization of marijuana has followed a similar trajectory. Approval has risen from 12 percent in 1969 to 28 percent in 1977 and 66 percent in 2019, reports Gallup. The steepest gains have occurred among the youngest cohort; 80 percent of millennials (those born from 1980 to 2000) favored legalization, compared with 61 percent of baby boomers (born from 1946 to 1964).\n\nAs these examples show, public opinion is no monolith. The cohesion that Trump has achieved among his supporters presents a formidable challenge to Democrats. Their whole strategy is premised on the hope that further shocking revelations will alter the political climate. Trump\u2019s image will be so shattered that Republican senators will feel free to join the revolt against him.\n\nIt will be easy to tell the victors from the vanquished. Just count the number of Republicans who vote for conviction. Let the battle begin.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "We\u2019re about to enter an extended period of high political theater.", "authors": ["Robert J.
