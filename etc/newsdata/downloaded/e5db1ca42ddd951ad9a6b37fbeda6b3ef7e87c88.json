(Hector Rematal/AFP/Gerry Images) (Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn the third quarter of Thursday\u2019s game between the United States and Japan at the FIBA World Cup in Shanghai, Rui Hachimura shoved off an NBA all-star with his left forearm and approached one of the league\u2019s top shot blockers at the rim. These were some of the best players in the world, but Hachimura displayed no timidity. In one play, he showed he could soon belong.\n\nHachimura, the new face of Japanese basketball and the Washington Wizards\u2019 top incoming rookie, blew past Milwaukee Bucks forward Khris Middleton and dunked in the face of Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner for his single highlight of the Americans\u2019 98-45 blowout win.\n\n[Rui Hachimura\u2019s selection by the Wizards breaks barriers and raises expectations in Japan]\n\nRui Hachimura put Myles Turner on a poster \ud83d\ude33#FIBAWC pic.twitter.com/Cpe1qIyTaR \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) September 5, 2019\n\nRui Hachimura introduces himself to Myles Turner pic.twitter.com/pzotvlhULI \u2014 Rob Perez (@WobLive) September 5, 2019\n\nThe clip played well on social media, as dunks do, just like Hachimura\u2019s other highlight from earlier in the FIBA tournament when he taught another NBA player, Ersan Ilyasova of Turkey, not to test him at the basket. But as spectacular as those highlights were, they did not depict Hachimura\u2019s overall performance, especially his struggles Thursday in his first test against a roster of seasoned NBA players.\n\nHe won\u2019t get another in this tournament. Japan and the Wizards announced Thursday night that he would sit out the final two games because of \u201cknee discomfort and general fatigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Team Japan,\u201d Hachimura said in a statement Thursday night. \u201cThis was a difficult decision for the Wizards, Japan Basketball, and myself to make. I am still learning about my body and trust that the Wizards and Japan Basketball are doing everything they can to help me be the best I can be for the NBA season and the 2020 Olympics.\u201d\n\nHachimura started and played 24 minutes against U.S. players such as Middleton, Turner, Boston Celtics star Kemba Walker and Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell, and he finished with just four points on 2-for-8 shooting. He recorded four rebounds and one assist, but his plus-minus rating was a dismal minus-48, showing his team was heavily outscored during his time on the court.\n\nBoth of his made field goals \u2014 the dunk and a pull-up midrange jumper \u2014 came in the third quarter, after he had settled into the game and showed more aggression. Before that, however, Hachimura was not the best Japanese-born NBA player on the floor.\n\nThat distinction belonged to Yuta Watanabe, the George Washington product who last year split time with the Memphis Grizzlies and their G League affiliate. Watanabe scored four of his national team\u2019s first six points. Though Japan was clearly overmatched \u2014 it trailed 18-6 at that point \u2014 he looked comfortable against his American NBA peers, whose team lacks star power but still has the deepest roster in the tournament.\n\nStill, Watanabe finished with just nine points in 27 minutes and was the only Japanese player to post a lower net rating than Hachimura at minus-49. Yudai Baba, who suited up for the Dallas Mavericks in July\u2019s Las Vegas Summer League, led Japan with 18 points and was the only Japanese player to crack double digits.\n\n[Archive: In Japan, he is \u2018The Chosen One.\u2019 Can Yuta Watanabe become the country\u2019s second-ever NBA player?]\n\nCeltics swingman Jaylen Brown paced the United States with 20 points and added seven rebounds, making up for the absence of his Boston teammate Jayson Tatum, who sprained his left ankle in the Americans\u2019 previous game. Walker added 15 points and eight assists, and Harrison Barnes of the Sacramento Kings had 14 points and eight rebounds. The United States next will face reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece on Saturday in the second round of the World Cup.\n\n\n\nRui Hachimura battles Harrison Barnes and Myles Turner for a rebound.

Not in Japan\u2019s zone defense that pulled him to the perimeter and forced him to pick up a bad foul by hacking Brook Lopez from behind after he scored at the rim. And not on the offensive end, either, where Hachimura\u2019s first shot attempt \u2014 a turnaround jumper \u2014 came when his team trailed 8-0 and led to a three-pointer on the other end that padded the score.\n\nIn the final two minutes of the first quarter, Hachimura finally got aggressive when the smaller Derrick White, a point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, switched onto him. Hachimura backed White down and was fouled before making the shot. The two points didn\u2019t count, though, and Japan didn\u2019t score on the possession. Hachimura went scoreless in the first half and was a minus-28 at the break.\n\nHachimura looked like a different player after halftime when he created his highlight moment. Still, while Hachimura soon will join the game\u2019s elite in the NBA, his debut against this level of talent was an up-and-down display for a rookie who still is learning to play with the world\u2019s best.\n\nRead more:\n\nNear-loss to Turkey forces USA Basketball to confront its mortality earlier than expected\n\nFive burning questions for USA Basketball as the FIBA World Cup gets underway\n\nWizards make history with selection of Gonzaga\u2019s Rui Hachimura in first round\n\nRui Hachimura arrives in Washington, with Japanese media throng in tow\n\nWizards mailbag: What would success look like for this team in 2019-20?", "description": "The Wizards\u2019 top draft pick faced a team filled with NBA players in the United States's victory over Japan.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards.", "September At Am", "Candace Buckner Covers The Washington Wizards.
