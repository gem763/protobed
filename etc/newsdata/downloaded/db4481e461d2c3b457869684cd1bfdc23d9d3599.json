I have a feeling she will say no, but we will hold it for the debates.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, however, the president denied that he ever said such a thing.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. You better read it again,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nWarren, eager to remind him of the pledge, defiantly tweeted Monday that Trump should send a check to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center.\n\nAccompanying the senator\u2019s release of the report was a sweeping biographical video, the likes of which one could imagine playing during a presidential nominating convention.\n\nIn the short film, Warren spends time in her hometown of Norman, Oklahoma, while clips of President Trump are heard repeatedly calling her \u201cPocahontas\u201d\u2014the frequent attack he\u2019s employed in a similar manner to to his repeated questioning of President Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\n\nWarren\u2019s brothers\u2014some of whom are registered Republicans\u2014appear on-camera and call Trump\u2019s epithet \u201cridiculous,\u201d while the Massachusetts senator tells the story of how her parents met and how her paternal relatives opposed the marriage because of Warren\u2019s mother being part Native American.\n\nAt the end of the video, Warren pivots to a defense of Native American citizens, saying, \u201cTrump can say whatever he wants about me. But mocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get at me, that\u2019s not what America stands for.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Warren decided to so transparently confront Trump\u2019s repeated race-based criticism speaks to her seeming preparedness and eagerness to clear any doubts about her personal heritage ahead of a prospective national campaign.\n\nPrior to Monday\u2019s disclosure, the Boston Globe took an exhaustive look at Warren\u2019s previous law-school hirings and determined that her background played no role in the jobs she attained throughout her career.\n\nIn addition to confronting perceived holes in her personal biography\u2014a rite of passage for anyone who could come under the increased scrutiny of a presidential run\u2014Warren has recently played an extraordinarily active role in elevating Democratic candidates for the midterms while keeping the door open for a potential 2020 run.\n\nThe Washington Post detailed an extensive operation she is shepherding to assist candidates, in addition to focusing on her own re-election campaign, which she is expected to win easily.\n\nWarren has also introduced a broad set of legislative packages that include the lofty goals of overhauling corporate stake-holding rules, targeting corruption and the influence of lobbyists in Washington, and ameliorating America\u2019s housing-segregation problem.\n\nAsked explicitly about running at a recent town hall in Massachusetts, Warren said: \u201cAfter November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: The Cherokee Nation released a statement on Monday afternoon. \u201cUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong,\u201d the tribe\u2019s secretary of state wrote. \u201cIt makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven.\u201d\n\nThe statement concluded: \u201cSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jamie Ross contributed reporting.", "description": "The senator sought to negate the frequent attacks on her claimed heritage.
