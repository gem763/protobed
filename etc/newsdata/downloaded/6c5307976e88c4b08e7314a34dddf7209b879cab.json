It was said to be the first time that Tu-160 bombers have ever landed on the African continent.\n\nThe Russian warplanes were escorted on arrival by two fighter jets of the South African Air Force, according to a statement from the South African National Defense Forces, which noted the \"strong historical links with diplomatic relations\" between Russia and South Africa.\n\n\"The 'Military to Military' relations between the two countries is not solely built on struggle politics but rather on fostering mutually beneficial partnerships based on common interests,\" the South African National Defense Forces said in the statement Wednesday.\n\nEmmanuel Croset/AFP via Getty Images\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defense said in a separate statement that the deployment of the aircraft to South Africa reflects a \"strategic partnership\" and is intended to help \"develop bilateral military cooperation.\"\n\nThe arrival of the nuclear-capable bombers in one of Africa's most industrialized countries appeared to coincide with the start of the first-ever Russia-Africa summit, meant to increase Moscow's clout on the world's second-largest, second-most populous continent.

The Kremlin said a package of trade, economic and investment agreements are expected to be signed following the Russia-Africa summit.\n\n\u201cMany Russian companies have long and successfully worked with partners from the most different sectors of the African economy and plan to expand their influence in Africa,\" Putin told the crowd in Sochi on Wednesday. \"We of course will provide support at the state level.\"", "description": "Two Tupolev Tu-160 bombers, which are supersonic Soviet-era aircraft capable of launching nuclear missiles, landed at a South African Air Force base on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/AirForce-tupolev-Tu-160-gty-ml-191024_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
