Stand with Hong Kong,\" included the symbol of one of the protest groups in Hong Kong. The tweet offended many mainland Chinese citizens.\n\nSince Morey's tweet, which he later deleted, several Chinese companies have severed ties with the NBA.\n\nStreaming platform Tencent said it would stop broadcasting Rockets games.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) suspends operations with the Rockets. NBA Hall of Famer and Chinese star Yao Ming is the president of the CBA.\n\nChina Central Television (CCTV), the state broadcasting network in China, said it would stop broadcasting Rockets games.\n\nChinese shoe company Li Ning suspends operations with the Rockets.\n\nChinese shoe company Alta suspends operations with the Rockets.\n\nShanghai Pudong Development Bank Card Center suspends operations with the Rockets.\n\nChinese smartphone producer Vivo suspends business with the NBA.\n\nOnline shopping sites owned by Alibaba and JD.com appear to take down Rockets merchandise, according to CNBC.\n\nNBA G League game between Rockets affiliate the Rio Grande Valley Vipers and Texas Legends in China is canceled.\n\nCCTV says it will not broadcast two NBA preseason games slated to take place in China after Silver defends Morey's freedom of speech.\n\nNBA cares event with the Brooklyn Nets at an educational center in Shanghai is canceled. Silver said the NBA would still honor its commitment to provide new computers and facilities to the center.\n\nThe NBA has a burgeoning business and fan base in China. Over 500 million Chinese citizens watched an NBA game last season, and according to reports, the NBA signed a five-year, $500 million deal with Tencent over the offseason.\n\nThe NBA itself has drawn criticism for appearing to care about its bottom-line in China over defending Morey. Several lawmakers on Monday lambasted the league for its response to the tweet and subsequent controversy.\n\nRead more: Lawmakers slammed the NBA after it failed to defend Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey from Chinese outrage when he backed the Hong Kong protests\n\nSilver attempted to push back on that criticism on Tuesday, saying the league's values come first and foremost.\n\n\"It is inevitable that people around the world \u2013 including from America and China \u2013 will have different viewpoints over different issues,\" Silver said in a press release on Tuesday. \"It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\n\n\"However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\nSilver said at a press conference shortly after the release of his statement that he hopes China will look past Morey's tweet and recognize the business the two parties have done together.\n\n\"The long-held values of the NBA are to support freedom of expression, and certainly freedom of expression by members of the NBA community. And in this case Daryl Morey, as the general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,\" Silver said.\n\n\"What I also tried to suggest is I understand that there are consequences from that exercise of, in essence, his freedom of speech. We will have to live with those consequences. It's my hope that for our Chinese fans and our partners in China, they will see those remarks in the context of now a three-decade, if not longer, relationship, and that we've done, in partnership with the Chinese Basketball Association, the Department of Education and many different businesses in China, I feel an enormous amount to build the sport, to work in communities, to focus on healthy lifestyles. That's where we find ourselves, but that as a league, we are not willing to compromise those values.\"\n\nThe issue, however, does not seem to be dying down. Silver acknowledged as much on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm a realist as well, and I recognize that this issue may not die down so quickly.\"", "description": "Several Chinese companies have ended or suspended operations with the Rockets and NBA in response to Daryl Morey's tweet.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cc0a80977cd5389798c66?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
