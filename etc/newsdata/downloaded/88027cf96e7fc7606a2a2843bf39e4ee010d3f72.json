I\u2019m not getting pessimistic. We will be pushing ahead but there is still work to be done.\u201d\n\nBritain has outlined a number of ideas to eliminate the controversial backstop plan to keep the Northern Irish border open in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 although a leaked EU memo dismissed them as unworkable.\n\nThe British government is said to be pursuing measures that would see Northern Ireland tied to some EU trade rules after Brexit, effectively drawing a regulatory border down the Irish Sea.\n\nJohnson said there are \u201cclearly still gaps and still difficulties\u201d in the negotiations but that he still holds out hope a deal could be secured by October 31, when the U.K. is meant to leave the bloc.\n\nHe said the interest shown in one proposal \u2013 that Ireland and Northern Ireland could remain a single system for agricultural products \u2014 is \u201cencouraging.\u201d\n\nAsked whether other products, such as manufactured goods, could be covered by an all-Ireland regime, he suggested the U.K. might want to diverge from the EU on industrial standards after Brexit, and simultaneously \u201ckeep goods moving fluidly.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe think we can do both.\u201d", "description": "British PM to meet EU leaders at UN summit, says he is still \u2018cautiously optimistic\u2019 about securing a deal.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169762529-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
