Governments too need to do more in this area. Only by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s match was temporarily halted by the Croatian referee under a three-step UEFA protocol, but the stoppage did not go far enough for some anti-racism activists who felt the England players should have walked off.\n\nAnti-racism organisation Kick It Out said UEFA\u2019s existing sanctions were not fit for purpose and called for Bulgaria to be booted out.\n\n\u201cThere can be no more pitiful fines or short stadium bans. If UEFA care at all about tackling discrimination \u2014 and if the Equal Game campaign means anything \u2014 then points deductions and tournament expulsion must follow,\u201d it said.\n\nMihaylov had previously defended Bulgarian soccer from accusations of racism and criticised England for what he saw as a \u201cfixation\u201d on potential incidents that could raise tension.\n\nHis departure came just hours after a Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) spokesman said Mihaylov would not resign because the state had no right to interfere in football.\n\nA later statement said that Mihaylov\u2019s formal resignation would be presented to the Executive Committee on Friday.\n\n\u201cHis position is a consequence of recent tensions; an environment that is detrimental to Bulgarian football and the Bulgarian Football Union,\u201d it said.\n\nReuters was not able to reach Mihaylov by telephone on Tuesday.\n\nMore than 20 police officers swept into the (BFU) headquarters on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBut the Bulgarian chief prosecutor\u2019s spokeswoman said that the operation was part of an investigation conducted by the Specialized Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and so not directly related to the racism row.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about crimes against sport,\u201d Rumyana Arnaudova told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about corruption offences, connected to the work of the BFU\u2019s referee commission and the appointment of referees on football matches.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is still under way and it\u2019s too early to say if there\u2019ll be some arrests.\u201d\n\nA police vehicle is seen outside the headquarters of the Bulgarian Football Union in Sofia, Bulgaria, October 15, 2019.REUTERS/Dimitar Kyosemarliev\n\nMihaylov, captain of the Bulgarian national team that made it to the World Cup semi-finals in 1994, has been heavily criticised by local media and soccer fans for failing to lead the BFU out of years of corruption and controversy.\n\nBulgaria have failed to qualify for a major tournament since 2004, while Mihaylov\u2019s tenure has been marred by allegations of cronyism. He has denied such allegations in the past.\n\nThere have been widespread reports of match-fixing in Bulgaria in recent years but little in the way of progress in holding anyone accountable.", "description": "Bulgarian soccer chief Borislav Mihaylov resigned on Tuesday after fans taunted England's black players with Nazi salutes and monkey chants during a Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia, prompting match officials to halt the game twice.", "authors": ["Angel Krasimirov", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441159547&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1EM", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
