On Wednesday afternoon, during a CNBC interview, he said that he\u2019s sees some early cracks that are worth investors\u2019 attention.\n\nThose include readings of consumer sentiment and a disparity between gauges of volatility in the bond and the stock markets.\n\n\u2018The VIX index has settled down to about 15 but the MOVE index\u2026remains incredibly elevated despite the fact that bonds have really kind of stabilized, which kind of suggests that there\u2019s a belief in the bond market that volatility is not going to go away.\u2019 Jeff Gundlach\n\nThe bond market pro says that a closely watched measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03%, the Cboe Volatility VIX, -3.39%, which uses bullish and bearish options bets on the index to help gauge expected swings in stocks in the coming 30 days, has been fairly quiescent of late, suggesting that equity-market investors have become somewhat complacent.\n\nThe VIX stood at around 14.61 Wednesday afternoon, below its historic average of around 19, while Merrill Lynch\u2019s MOVE Index, an indicator of volatility in 10-year U.S. government bonds TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.34% in coming month, has remained elevated since reaching a 2 \u00bd-year high In June.\n\nEarlier, the disparity between the VIX compared to the MOVE Index was its widest since 2017 (see chart below):\n\nBloomberg via @acemaxx on Twitter\n\nGundlach\u2019s takeaway from the gap in the stock and bond volatility measures is that the bond market, a group of investors viewed as the \u201csmart money,\u201d is betting that turbulence will continue to swirl in markets.\n\nRead: Gundlach sees 75% recession chance, has a warning about the corporate bond market\n\nThe DoubeLine founder also said investors should watch for shifts in consumer sentiment. Particularly, he said market participants should pay attention to breakdowns in how consumers feel about the future and expect that to eventually coincide with a deterioration of their view of present conditions.\n\nGundlach described that as one of the \u201cmost compelling\u201d measures of the economic health in the U.S.\n\nAs for the Fed, the prominent investor said he doesn\u2019t believe the central bank should cut interest rates but thinks they likely will at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Fed should cut but they will,\u201d he said.\n\nWall Street is expecting a quarter of a percentage point cut but the language of the Fed\u2019s statement at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, and Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s news conference could be a key driver of trading in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%.\n\nCheck out: Fed decision and Jerome Powell press conference: live blog and video", "description": "Bond-market guru Jeff Gundlach says he\u2019s watching a few areas of the market to gauge whether the current bullish dynamic is starting to unravel in earnest....", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR239_gundla_ZG_20181004193537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
