The bloc has agreed in principle, but has not fixed the extension's length.\n\nIn London, British politicians are set to vote on whether to hold an early election to try to break the country's deadlock over Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants a Dec. 12 election, but looks unlikely to get the required support from two-thirds of lawmakers.\n\nTwo opposition parties plan to push for a Dec. 9 election if Johnson's proposal fails.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
