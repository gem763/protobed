Ms. Nevils, whose complaint about Mr. Lauer led to his firing in 2017, went public for the first time in Ronan Farrow\u2019s forthcoming book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is shocking and appalling and I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it,\u201d Ms. Guthrie said during the NBC morning show. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then, it\u2019s not easy now, and we support her and any women who have come forward with claims. It\u2019s just very painful for all of us at NBC and at the Today show. It\u2019s very, very, very difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve known someone for 12 years,\u201d Ms. Kotb said, \u201cand then all of a sudden, a door opens up and it\u2019s a part of them you didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know all the facts in all of this, but they\u2019re not allegations of an affair; they\u2019re allegations of a crime,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here who\u2019ve sat with Matt for many, many years. So, I think we\u2019re gonna just continue to process this part of this horrific story. And, as [Savannah] said, our thoughts are with Brooke. It\u2019s not easy what she did to come forward.\u201d\n\nMs. Guthrie added, \u201cI think I speak for all of us: We\u2019re disturbed to our core. And we have a commitment to keep you informed and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\u201d\n\nMr. Lauer was fired in 2017 after Ms. Nevils, who was then unnamed, reported Mr. Lauer for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\u201d Multiple women, including fellow employees and subordinates, came forward to accuse the veteran news anchor of sexual misconduct.\n\nMr. Lauer responded to the most recent allegation in a letter obtained by Variety on Wednesday, writing, \u201cIn a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts and defies common sense. I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
