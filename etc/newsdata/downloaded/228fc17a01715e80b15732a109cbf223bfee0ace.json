Large conditioner sizes that actually fulfill the unmet needs of our community. Accessible pricing because everyone should have access to their most beautiful hair in their own shower, and gorgeous packaging that conjures the legacy of our history and makes us all feel like the royalty that we are,\" she said in the post. \u2060\u2800\n\nThe products will be available to shop on Sept. 9, and there appears to be shampoo, conditioners and hair serums included in the brand.\n\nThis isn't the first time Ross has dabbled into the hair care arena. In 2015 she partnered with Optimum Amla Legend, another sought after company with high-grade hair products created for multicultural women.\n\nMany women are already enthused about Ross' new hair products and left her congratulatory comments.\n\nOne Instagrammer, Jennifer Faroul, wrote, \"Take all my money. You were my inspiration to go natural 6 years ago so believe me I'll be on the site at 9 AM on Monday morning.\"\n\nChantelle Bateman also chimed in, saying, \"I don't usually consider buying celebrities' product lines, but when I do....*goes to spend all my coins on new curl products by my fave famous curly girl.*\"", "description": "Tracee Ellis Ross announced her new hair care line called Pattern will officially launch on Sept. 9, 2019.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/tracee-ellis-ross-gty-jc-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
