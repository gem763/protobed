Grow up, Rep. Tlaib", "language": "en", "text": "I like Rashida Tlaib. I oversee an editorial board that endorsed her in her inaugural run for Congress. We have friendly disagreements about policy, and more frequent ones about tactics, but I have met very few lawmakers who work harder on behalf of their constituents than Tlaib does.\n\nI\u2019m also a champion for class clowns, and for the healing power of comic relief. If it weren\u2019t for the Stephen Colberts of the world, my head might have exploded sometime in early 2017.\n\nBut Tlaib is not a late-night comic. She\u2019s one of 435 people who may soon be asked to decide whether a president (who came to office via a constitutional process that has assured the peaceful transition of executive power for more than 200 years) should be expelled from office before his term expires.\n\nAnd now she\u2019s turned that weighty responsibility into a T-shirt line.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brian Dickerson", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion Donald-Trump-Impeachment-Tshirts-Rashida-Tlaib-Inappropriate-Column"], "top_image": ""}
