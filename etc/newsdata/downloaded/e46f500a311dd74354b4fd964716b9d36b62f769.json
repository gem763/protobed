However, the president of the court noted it would be difficult to get testimony from many of the victims, some of whom are likely to be illegal migrants. The trial is set to last until October 18th.\n\nThe case is not the first instance of migrant gangs extorting money from prostitutes in France. In Paris, three young migrants from Egypt were arrested earlier this year after robbing several transgender prostitutes in the Bois de Boulogne park, a hotspot for street prostitution.\n\nThe case came just months after police arrested nine illegal migrants in the French capital following the fatal shooting of South American transgender prostitute Vanesa Campos, born Victor Elias in Peru.\n\nThe migrant gang was well-known in Paris\u2019s 16th arrondissement and had made a business of extorting and robbing both the street prostitutes and their clients. Investigators said, much like the Moroccan gang, they had also raped at least one of the sex workers.", "description": "A gang of Moroccan migrants face trial after being accused of robbing and sexually assaulting prostitutes in several cities across France.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/GettyImages-695269004.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
