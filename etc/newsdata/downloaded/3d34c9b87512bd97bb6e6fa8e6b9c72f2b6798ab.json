Here's what it says about how private equity is battling banks to fill 6-figure jobs.\n\nWe put together a look at what some colleges are doing, and a firm-by-firm glance at where the biggest PE shops have been recruiting.\n\nTo be sure, many firms are largely still refraining from recruiting undergraduate investment analysts, and outreach and programs at schools do not ensure promises of actual placement. And firms are keeping hiring classes small \u2014 even some of the bigger names hire only a handful of people \u2014 so the field is extremely competitive.\n\nBain Capital, for one, started college recruiting a little over a decade ago but has told us that this year is shaping up to be its busiest undergraduate season ever. The Carlyle Group, though, recruits analysts for only non-investment positions \u2014 namely, fund management and accounting.\n\n'A noticeable change'\n\nThe outreach reflects private-equity firms' push to diversify their ranks, as well as an effort to beat competitors to promising talent early on, insiders said. Firms are also taking advantage of technology like webinars to hit a wider variety of schools.\n\n\"There has been a noticeable change this year with the really large PE shops starting to recruit college grads and starting internship programs,\" William Maxwell, a finance professor at the Cox School of Business at SMU, told Business Insider.\n\nSMU is one school where PE firms, including KKR, have been looking, a process for which Maxwell has clear line of visibility, given his role overseeing an honors program dedicated to alternative asset management. He said about 50 students from the program go into investment banking ever year, but private equity is increasingly showing up at the doorstep.\n\nRead more: Private equity firms used to send junior staff off for an MBA. Now they're keeping some around to help spend all the money they've raised.\n\n\"Some firms are determined to get first shot,\" he said.\n\nShawn Munday, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Kenan-Flagler School of Business, has observed a similar scene. Private-equity firms such as Blackstone, Roark Capital, and Falfurrias Capital are showing up at UNC to directly recruit undergrads, he said.\n\n\"As a result, we've adapted to stay in front of this trend,\" Munday said.\n\nOver the past four years, UNC has added a curriculum for undergraduates about the buy side, including courses covering how to evaluate deals and model leveraged buyouts. The school also offers boot-camp training, giving students the opportunity to source deals and build cases to invest for a UNC portfolio fund.\n\nAmy Donegan, an undergraduate career adviser at Boston College, said that three years ago, the school did not see any noticeable PE undergraduate recruiting. This year, four PE firms \u2014 Broad Haven, Summit, Vista Equity Partners, and TM Capital \u2014 are slated to recruit on campus in the fall.\n\n\"A lot of the students coming into these positions out of undergrad have the technical skills they need anyway,\" Donegan said, adding that they have quant-heavy resumes, with skills in data analytics and Python.\n\nRead more: Elizabeth Warren's attack on private equity could have a surprising group of backers: Investors in private equity\n\nAnd last year, Kansas State launched a program focused on preparing undergraduate students who want to become analysts either at an investment bank or private-equity firm.\n\n\"We are offering a new class in portfolio management and giving students a stronger, more in-depth look at the valuation process,\" Ansley Chua, a finance professor at Kansas State, said.\n\nThe Kansas State program seats 10 people, and some smaller PE firms have hired Chua's students, though he would like to double the program's size and place students at larger firms in cities like New York and San Francisco.\n\nChua said he has been in touch with alumni members, including Paul Edgerley, a senior adviser at Bain Capital who has hosted students at the private-equity firm in Boston for informational sessions. (Edgerley and his wife, Sandra, contributed $20 million to the school earlier this year.)", "description": "Business Insider gathered names of schools where private-equity firms have scouted, and we talked to colleges developing PE-geared programs.", "authors": ["Casey Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d0272c66fc92009ec3ca666-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
