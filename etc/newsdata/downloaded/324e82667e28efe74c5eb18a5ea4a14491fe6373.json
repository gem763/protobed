Rather, has the risk of a supply disruption been underpriced? In other words, have markets been too complacent about the geopolitical tensions in the region?\n\n\u201cNo matter whether it takes Saudi Arabia 5 days or a lot longer to get oil back into production, there is but one rational takeaway from this weekend\u2019s drone attacks on the Kingdom\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 that infrastructure is highly vulnerable to attack, and the market has been persistently mispricing oil,\u201d Citi commodities expert Ed Morse wrote on Sunday.\n\nMorse argues that oil \u201cshould have been a good $10 a barrel higher than it has been for months.\u201d\n\nThis weekend\u2019s drone strikes hit Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq processing facility and Khurais oil field.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq is the single most important facility in Saudi's oil industry, while Khurais is the second biggest oil field,\u201d S&P Global Platts analyst Paul Hicklin said. Remember, Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil player among the OPEC nations. Oil exports drive the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cAbqaia\u2019s vulnerability means it is one of the most heavily guarded places on Earth and it has long been thought that it was safe in most circumstances short of war with Iran,\u201d energy analyst John Kemp said.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq has always been a much greater source of risk for the oil market than Strait of Hormuz,\u201d Kemp added. \u201cBut until the last 48 hours it was assumed to be a high consequence low probability danger so was largely discounted. That won\u2019t be possible any more.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has already said that his administration is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d suggesting that the U.S. is prepared to intervene with a military response. It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s next in this unfolding saga. What\u2019s clear is all\u2019s not well and a range of destabilizing events could come. And that uncertainty comes at a price.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.
