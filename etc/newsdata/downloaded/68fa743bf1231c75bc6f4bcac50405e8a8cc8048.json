He would instead throw just three pitches. Two of them left the ballpark.\n\nLeading off the inning, Anthony Rendon caught a ball low in the zone and sent it over the wall in left field to cut the Dodgers lead to 3-2. The very next pitch, Juan Soto took advantage of a hanging slider to tie the game. Judging by his reaction, Kershaw knew it was gone as soon as Soto made contact, maybe even before.\n\n\u2014Sporting News MLB (@sn_mlb) October 10, 2019\n\nKenta Maeda would relieve Kershaw after that, striking out the next three batters in order, but the damage was already done. A once jovial Dodger Stadium tensed at the realization that another horrifying playoff exit loomed. In the top of the 10th inning, the Nationals put the nail in the coffin with a Howie Kendrick grand slam.\n\nAfter the game, Kershaw could only blame himself for the loss.\n\n\"Everything people say is true right now about postseason,\" Kershaw said. \"I understand that.\"\n\n\"I had one job to do. Just get three outs. Got one out and didn't get the other two. Went over the fence and cost us the game right there. It's a terrible feeling. No excuses. Just didn't make pitches and guy hit it over the fence, twice.\"\n\nThrough 162 games of regular season baseball, the highs and lows of a season tend average each other out. But the postseason is made up of singular moments and performances, and Kershaw always seems to find himself on the loser's end of those moments.\n\nThe circumstances are confounding, even to himself.\n\n\"I've had to do it so much. I don't know,\" Kershaw said when asked how long it would take him to get over the loss. \"It might linger for a while. I might not get over it. I don't know. But spring training is going to come, I have to be ready to pitch, do my job as best I can.\"\n\nWith three Cy Young awards, an NL MVP, and a career ERA of 2.44, Kershaw is one of the best to ever take the mound. His regular-season success has only made his postseason collapses more baffling, and harder to watch with each successive failure.\n\nKershaw's story seems written as the precursor to his coming career-defining moment. In the movie version of his hero's journey, Kershaw would find his redemption, finally carrying his regular-season dominance into October to bring the Dodgers their first World Series title since 1988.\n\nBut that story has been set up for years now, and with each opportunity to dig himself out, Kershaw has only fallen deeper.\n\nThe ending is always the same.\n\nThe NBA is trying to play both sides of the controversial Hong Kong tweet and hoping their long history in China will help\n\nGardner Minshew is said to be a fantasy-football savant but refuses to pick himself\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS: Where every team stands heading into Week 6\n\nThe Richard Sherman-Baker Mayfield handshake drama has taken a bizarre and confusing turn as video appears to show them shaking hands", "description": "\"Everything people say is true right now about the postseason,\" Kershaw said after giving up two home runs in the Dodgers Game 5 loss.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f44003b33a71d8f0dfec6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
