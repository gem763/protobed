As the two neighbors meet in a 2022 World Cup qualifier on Tuesday, the only attention the English Premier League star can expect in Pyongyang is from the home team\u2019s defenders.\n\nThe \u201cKorean Derby\u201d is the first Pyongyang meeting between North Korea and South Korea since a friendly game in 1990. It is also the first-ever competitive fixture north of the 38th parallel between the two countries that remain in a technical state of war.\n\nThe EPL is the most popular international league in South Korea, but little-watched in internationally isolated North Korea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the (North Korean) fans know much about Son Heung-min but the players know him well,\u201d An Yong Hak, a former North Korea international, told The Associated Press. \u201cFans in Pyongyang are looking forward to the game. It is not just the opponent, but this is an important World Cup qualifier and if we win it will be a great result.\u201d\n\nAn played in all four qualifiers between the two teams ahead of the 2010 World Cup. South Korea won one match, with draws in the other three - two of which took place in Shanghai and not Pyongyang at the request of North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has home advantage with the 50,000 capacity Kim Il Sung Stadium expected to be full. \u201cIt is a big stadium. North Koreans love football and will make plenty of noise,\u201d An said.\n\nNorth Korea has not allowed any journalists or fans from South Korea to make the trip to Pyongyang. Requests from the Korea Football Association in Seoul for players and officials to travel directly across the Demilitarized Zone, which divides the neighbors, were also denied. It is unclear whether there will even be a live broadcast from the game.\n\nOn the field, there are other issues such as the artificial grass in the stadium. Arriving in Pyongyang the day before the game, South Korea will have just one training session on the surface.\n\nDespite the challenges, players sounded confident as they left Seoul for the North Korean capital via Beijing where they have been told to leave their mobile phones until their return.\n\n\u201cAll we are thinking about is coming back with three points,\u201d said midfielder Lee Jae-sung. \u201cThere\u2019s no fear. There are always difficult away games like Turkmenistan, Lebanon and Iran and we don\u2019t think this will be any more difficult than those.\u201d\n\nIn 17 previous meetings, South Korea has lost only once, the defeat coming in its sole previous visit to Pyongyang.\n\nThis time too, South Korea, aiming for a 10th successive World Cup appearance, is the favorite headed into the game.\n\nSouth Korea sits top of Group H in the second round of qualification with six points after two games. It\u2019s above North Korea on goal difference.\n\nOnly the winner from each of the eight five-team groups and the four best second-placed teams progress to the next stage.\n\n\u201cWe both went to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup,\u201d said An. \u201cI hope we can go to Qatar together too.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Son Heung-min may be the biggest soccer name in South Korea and across Asia but the Tottenham forward's fame struggles to penetrate North Korea.
