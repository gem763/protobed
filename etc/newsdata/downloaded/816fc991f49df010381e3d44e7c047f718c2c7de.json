It is designed to give children equal protection from violence by removing the defence of \u201cjustifiable assault\u201d in Scots law.\n\nParents in England and Northern Ireland are currently allowed to use \u201creasonable chastisement\u201d, while similar legislation to Scotland was introduced by the Welsh government in March.\n\nLeading the final stage debate, Finnie, a former police officer, said there was an urgent need to bring Scotland into line with best practice across the world, with 57 other countries already prohibiting the physical punishment of children.\n\nReferring colleagues to the substantial body of research highlighting the damaging long-term effects of physical punishment on children, as well as its ineffectiveness as a parenting strategy, Finnie added: \u201cCritics of this simple reform often say that it criminalises parents, but there is no evidence that this change to the law leads to increased prosecutions in any of the more than 50 countries where this change has taken place.\u201d\n\nMSPs also rejected two amendments which the Scottish Conservatives claimed would clarify the bill, in particular around instances such as preventing a child running into a busy road or pulling a pan of boiling water on to themselves.\n\nThe Scottish government\u2019s children\u2019s minister, Maree Todd, insisted that the removal of the defence would not affect the ability of parents to use restraint to prevent a child coming to harm, saying there was a difference between an act of restraint and act of discipline but underlining that the purpose of the reform was to give equal protection \u201cwith zero qualifications\u201d.\n\nBut Oliver Mundell, the Scottish Conservative higher education spokesperson, who spoke for the amendments, said the bill failed to set out clear thresholds for state intervention in family life, arguing: \u201cThese concerns about criminalisation have been dismissed throughout the passage of this bill but the truth is no one here can guarantee how this bill will be implemented and interpreted by the police, prosecutors or our courts.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s campaigners welcomed the move as evidence of a wholesale shift in attitudes to child rearing and children\u2019s rights over the past few decades. Mary Glasgow, the chief executive of Children 1st, Scotland\u2019s national children\u2019s charity, condemned what she described as \u201cscaremongering\u201d during the debating of the bill: \u201cListening to the evidence from police, social workers and others working directly with families, it has been clear that there is no intent to criminalise parents, but to bring the law in line with the international evidence and modern parenting practice.\u201d\n\nOthers warned against complacency. Bruce Adamson, the children and young people\u2019s commissioner for Scotland, said: \u201cThe world is watching, and people hope this will inspire other parts of the UK, but we cannot be complacent as there\u2019s much more we can do to put rights-respecting laws in place, like incorporation of the UN convention on the rights of the child [UNCRC] into Scots law.\u201d\n\nIn May, the Scottish parliament voted to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12, but the reform was criticised by some for not raising the age to 14, in line with recommendations from the UN\u2019s committee on the rights of the child.\n\nLikewise, campaigners welcomed Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s commitment to incorporate the UNCRC into Scots law within the next two years, which the first minister made in her keynote speech to the SNP conference in April. However, they have since raised concerns that the legislation is not moving fast enough to be completed before the next Holyrood elections in the the spring of 2021.", "description": "Member\u2019s bill removing defence of \u2018justifiable assault\u2019 passed overwhelmingly", "authors": ["Nell Frizzell", "Lola Okolosie", "Susanna Rustin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14c3fdb8fbe0fb6d69ea4a759708a0d86bb4982/0_155_1622_973/master/1622.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=354474a8611deac6ad10615b58317cd7"}
