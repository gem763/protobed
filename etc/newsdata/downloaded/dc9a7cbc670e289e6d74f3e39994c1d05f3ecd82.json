Forge also had a man sent off when Borges saw red in the 69th minute.\n\nForge holds the advantage in the aggregate series, as a draw next week in Calgary will see them win Finals 2019. But Saturday's victory was costly for Forge, as the expulsion of Borges, the CPL's top scorer, means he will be suspended for Leg 2.\n\nCarducci keeps it close\n\nSaturday's contest started with a quick tempo, before quickly settling down as both clubs took a more cautious approach and began to feel each other out. Forge captain Kyle Bekker nearly broke the deadlock in the 34th minute when he fired a thunderbolt of a shot that crashed against the crossbar.\n\nMinutes later, the ball fell to Borges inside the box and as he headed towards the goal, Waterman slid across and handled the ball. The defender was shown a straight red card for denying a clear scoring opportunity (he'll be suspended for Leg 2), and Cavalry had to play a man short for the remainder of the match.\n\nBorges stepped up to the spot, only to see Cavalry goalkeeper Marco Carducci came up with a fabulous leg save to repel his penalty attempt. The visitors escaped another close call minutes later when Daniel Krutzen's free kick from 25 yards out hit the crossbar.\n\nBorges' curler\n\nBut the visitors' good fortune ran out in first-half injury time. Chris Nanco made an exquisite move down the left flank to masterfully pull away from two Cavalry players before feeding Borges, who curled a gorgeous shot from just inside the box past Carducci and into the upper corner. The goal was Borges' season-leading 13th of the campaign.\n\nThe home side poured on the pressure to start the second half, with Carducci coming up with a big save to deny Nanco inside the box, and David Edgar's rebound attempt smacked the crossbar.\n\nTensions boiled over in the 69th minute when Borges and Cavs defender Jay Wheeldon crashed into each other while challenging for a 50/50 ball. A small a melee ensued, and Borges was shown a red card as he was judged to have kicked out at Wheeldon.\n\n2nd leg awaits\n\nForge continued to press for a second card, only to be met by a sturdy Cavalry resistance the rest of the way.\n\nListed as day-to-day in the buildup before the game, captain Nik Ledgerwood overcame a head knock to start for Cavalry. Forge was missing defenders Dominic Samuel and Bertrand Owundi (both suspended).\n\nSaturday marked the eighth meeting in 2019 between Forge and the Cavs, including their second-round Canadian Championship series.\n\nLeg 2 of Finals 2019 is scheduled for next Saturday at ATCO Field at Spruce Meadows in Calgary.\n\nWATCH | fist-leg action between Forge FC and Cavalry FC:\n\nForge FC hosts Cavalry FC in Canadian Premier League Championship Game 1 from Hamilton, Ont. 2:30:43\n\nJohn Molinaro is the director of content for the Canadian Premier League.
