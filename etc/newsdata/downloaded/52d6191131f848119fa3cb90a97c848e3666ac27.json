Officials at Yale had previously moved to modify the artwork to remove the settlers\u2019 musket.\n\nElizondo claims that his peers, although they are live lavishly at Yale, behave as if they were members of an \u201coppressed religious cult.\u201d\n\nYale students enjoy luxuries akin to European aristocracy. Students live in resort-style housing that includes lavish feasts, massage parlors and recreational spaces that boast everything from a printing press to a pottery studio. However, Yale students afflicted with PDS display derangement symptoms similar to an oppressed religious cult. They refuse to interact with the world around them. They have demanded the buildings be renamed. They support the desecration of art. They sanitize history by demanding professors exclude certain authors from syllabi.\n\nElizondo compares \u201cprotester derangement syndrome\u201d to chickenpox in that it only \u201cflares up\u201d during periods of the academic year in which students have little to do. He then referenced an infamous encounter between Yale Professor Nicholas Christakis and a leftist student activist. The student screamed at Christakis because his wife, also a Yale professor, had argued against the existence of official university guidelines on acceptable Halloween costumes.\n\nPerhaps luckily for the non-afflicted population, PDS is similar to chicken pox: It usually lies dormant for a while. Generally, symptoms only flare up during low-intensity academic periods when students have little else to do. The hunger strike began during Dead Week (the last week of classes before reading period), and the time when dozens of Yale students mobbed and verbally assaulted a tenured professor, leading to his and his wife\u2019s resignation in 2016, occurred during Halloween, one of the least stressful times at Yale.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.", "description": "A Yale student penned a column for the\u00a0New York Post this week, accusing his leftist peers of suffering from \"protester derangement syndrome.\"", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/College-protest-against-fascism-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
