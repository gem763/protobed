All three eventually pleaded guilty to federal charges.\n\nBut the recent setbacks suggest there is a limit to the law\u2019s usefulness for federal prosecutors.\n\nThe former Obama attorney, Greg Craig, was acquitted of lying to the Justice Department\u2019s FARA unit. Weeks earlier, the judge in his case tossed out a charge of failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act for his work on behalf of the Ukrainian government.\n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson concluded that a 2013 letter Mr. Craig sent to FARA investigators was sufficient to clear him of charges under a law barring false FARA submissions.\n\n\u201cI think these cases have weakened the credibility of the FARA unit,\u201d said Claire Finkelstein, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who researches national security law. \u201cEven if Greg Craig had been convicted on the lying charge, it still would have been a black eye for the FARA unit because the foreign lobbying charge was dismissed.\u201d\n\nBen Freeman, director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy, said the Justice Department needed a win in the Craig case.\n\nWith so many Republicans brought up on FARA charges, he said, the optics of taking down Mr. Craig, a Democrat, would have benefited the department.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department really needed someone on the other side of the aisle to say, \u2018We are being evenhanded.\u2019 So not getting him does hurt them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Foreign Agents Registration Act was enacted just before World War II. It does not bar Americans from working with foreign governments, but it does require that they be transparent about their activities.\n\nWhat sorts of activities require registration can be tough to suss out, and the law languished in obscurity for years.\n\nFrom 1966 to 2017, the Justice Department brought just seven prosecutions under the act.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Justice Department revamped the FARA unit and said it would aggressively pursue cases.\n\nDavid Laufman, a partner at Wiggin and Dana who oversaw FARA enforcement while chief of the Justice Department\u2019s counterintelligence and export control section, said the goal is to increase registration among foreign lobbyists.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s more aggressive enforcement of FARA includes a great deal more than the number of criminal prosecutions brought and the success of those prosecutions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt focuses predominately on affecting compliance by ensuring parties that need to register do, in fact, register. So it\u2019s a mistake to measure the success of the Justice Department\u2019s overall increase of FARA enforcement by the success or failure of individual criminal prosecutions.\u201d\n\nEven so, it does not appear registrations have increased since the Justice Department ramped up FARA enforcement. At the end of last year, 453 registrations were active, according to the Justice Department\u2019s FARA database. As of Thursday, the department had 458 active registrants.\n\nThe Justice Department did not return a request for comment.\n\nHampering the department\u2019s effort is the unit\u2019s limited administrative authority. Investigators don\u2019t have the power to issue civil investigative demands, or CIDs, which legally compel investigation subjects to provide information and documents. Investigators can ask for information from foreign agents but can\u2019t force subjects to comply with the law outside of bringing criminal charges. That puts lobbyists on the honor system to self-report.\n\nOther Justice Department sections, including the antitrust and environmental and natural resources divisions, do posses CID authority.\n\nAs a result of the unit\u2019s limited enforcement power, lobbyists have largely flouted FARA requirements, and registrations have consistently dwindled from a peak of 2,079 in 1991.\n\nThe lack of administrative power was evident in the Craig case. In 2013, when Mr. Craig met with department investigators, they were essentially forced to take his word that he didn\u2019t have to register for his work on a project connected to the Ukrainian government.\n\nAll they asked of Mr. Craig was that he put his reasons for not registering in a letter.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department doesn\u2019t have a lot of options to enforce FARA,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cThere are no real civil penalties, they can\u2019t issue fines. It\u2019s like if you get pulled over for speeding and the police ask you to write a letter saying you weren\u2019t speeding. It doesn\u2019t work that way for speeding tickets, but it works for foreign influence violations.\u201d\n\nAnother problem is that the FARA statute is vague. Had the statute contained more certainty, it would be clear whether the Justice Department was justified in bringing charges against Mr. Craig in the first place. When Judge Jackson dismissed the foreign lobbying charge against Mr. Craig, she said the statute was too ambiguous to justify the criminal count.\n\n\u201cNo one is really clear who is under the statute,\u201d Ms. Finkelstein said. \u201cCraig worked for a firm that is working for the Ukraine. He is two steps removed, and the statute doesn\u2019t guide us on that. That\u2019s why the judge threw out the FARA violation.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
