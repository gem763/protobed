However, a quantum bit can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously, thus allowing an exponentially higher number of calculations to be performed.\n\nSuper-fast processing power enabled by quantum computing could herald in a new age of technological breakthroughs that humans can't even fathom in 2019.\n\nGoogle has been working on this topic since at least 2006, when one of its scientists started looking into how quantum computing could aid the company's efforts to speed up machine learning.\n\n\"I am excited about what quantum computing means for the future of Google and the world. Part of that optimism comes from the nature of the technology itself. You can trace the progress from the mega-computers of the 1950s to advances we\u2019re making in artificial intelligence today to help people in their everyday lives,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a statement.\n\nAPPLE'S TIM COOK TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN AT CHINESE BUSINESS SCHOOL AMID HONG KONG PROTESTS\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, a rival team at IBM expressed skepticism about Google's claim.\n\nIn a blog post announcing the findings, Google's scientists said hope to make quantum-supremacy class processors available to collaborators and academic researchers, among others.\n\nThe tech giant said it envisions a range of potential real-world applications of the breakthrough, which will take years of work to bring to fruition, including \"new materials \u2014 lightweight batteries for cars and airplanes, new catalysts that can produce fertilizer more efficiently (a process that today produces over 2 percent of the world\u2019s carbon emissions), and more effective medicines.\"\n\nSALESFORCE CEO SAYS FACEBOOK MUST BE BROKEN UP\n\n\"Quantum computing will be a great complement to the work we do (and will continue to do) on classical computers. In many ways quantum brings computing full circle, giving us another way to speak the language of the universe and understand the world and humanity not just in 1s and 0s but in all of its states: beautiful, complex, and with limitless possibility,\" Pichai added.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Imagine a system that could execute a calcuation in 200 seconds that it would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to handle.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/quantum-chip-google-ai.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
