(AP) - Blake Griffin worked so hard to lift the Detroit Pistons to the playoffs, then couldn\u2019t contribute as much once they were there.\n\nThat\u2019s what coach Dwane Casey would like to avoid this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said too many times, being from Kentucky, we rode him like a cheap horse last year,\u201d Casey said at media day Monday. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we would have made the playoffs, because he was that special to us, but again, with addition of some other talented guys on our team, hopefully we don\u2019t have to use him as much. I\u2019m not going to put that in concrete, but I have to be smarter as far as the usage, because he takes a beating.\u201d\n\nGriffin averaged 35.0 minutes per game last season, his most since 2014-15, while also achieving the highest scoring average (24.5) of his career. He played 75 regular-season games, his most since 2013-14, but he missed two of the four games when the Pistons were swept by Milwaukee in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nGriffin ended up having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, although he said that didn\u2019t cut into his offseason work too much.\n\n\u201cI sort of consider this summer a healthy summer,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt was kind of a four-to-six-week recovery. I think I was back on the court mid-June - so really only a couple weeks after I was last summer.\u201d\n\nADDITIONS\n\nPistons executive Ed Stefanski said he expects the team\u2019s depth to be improved.\n\n\u201cNot to be disparaging about players that were here, but I think it\u2019s gotten considerably better when you put Derrick Rose in at that point guard position coming off the bench,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cHe can move Reggie Jackson over to the two. Derrick had a terrific year last year. I think he averaged 17 points a game, on fairly limited minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Pistons signed Rose and forward Markieff Morris. They also signed Joe Johnson, who did not play in the NBA last season. Stefanski says Johnson will be competing for the 15th roster spot.\n\nDRUMMOND\u2019S FUTURE\n\nStefanski acknowledged that big man Andre Drummond is eligible for a contract extension, but he didn\u2019t say much more.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about contracts or negotiations,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cWe really like Andre - the person and the player.\u201d\n\nSECOND SEASON\n\nCasey was hired by the Pistons before last season. He thinks the team got better offensively down the stretch.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our statistics as the season went on from February 1st to April 1st, our offensive output - we were far more efficient,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe shot the ball better. We got the right shots, and as simple as it sounds, we made shots. I think we got used to the system that we implemented last year - the 3-point shooting system.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Blake Griffin worked so hard to lift the Detroit Pistons to the playoffs, then couldn't contribute as much once they were there.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
