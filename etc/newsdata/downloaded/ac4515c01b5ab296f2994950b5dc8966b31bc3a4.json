Jack-o\u2019-lanterns and Halloween beg for it. Pumpkin pie is on the menu back home but here in Japan, whole pumpkins are too expensive to be used for anything. Canned pumpkin\u2014I kid you not\u2014has not been on shelves anywhere this year and last. I\u2019ve resorted to begging my husband to lug 30 cans in his suitcase with every trip back. He loves me and agrees, bless that man.\n\nEnter kabocha (\u304b\u307c\u3061\u3083), the closest thing I\u2019ve found to a pumpkin in Japan. I love this but it comes with a warning. A biggie.\n\nIt\u2019s a beast to cut. I mean it. I can do it but it takes me a good five minutes to get the knife through the flesh. Use your biggest, best, sharpest, strongest butcher knife and be careful! I usually have to whack it a few times to make enough of a wedge to actually cut it apart.\n\nThe flesh of the kabocha is meaty and thick. Cut it into big chunks and bake it in the oven 180C (or 350F) for 30 minutes or until soft.\n\nWhile the kabocha is softening, start your pie crust.\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the crust\n\n1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n\n1/2 cup frozen butter (or lard or vegetable shortening)\n\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n4~5 tablespoon ice water\n\nTake note. The fat (butter/lard/shortening) must be frozen, and the ice water must contain ice. Don\u2019t cheat. The amount of ice water necessary changes according to the temperature and humidity inside and out. The warmer and more humid it is, the less ice water you\u2019ll need.\n\nFor the pie mixture\n\n4 eggs\n\n1 can evaporated milk (I use the one with 380 ml)\n\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n\n1 teaspoon nutmeg\n\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n\ndash of ground cloves\n\n2 cups softened and peeled kabocha\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the pie mixture\n\nUsing a cheese grater, grate the frozen butter into small bits. Add flour, sugar, and salt and toss lightly until half of the butter is covered. Add ice water a bit at a time, and form dough into a ball. The surface of the ball of dough should be smooth and you should be able to jam your finger into it and have it come out clean. Keep adding flour until you get the right consistency. Place in the fridge for 20 minutes. In another bowl, combine the pie mixture ingredients together and mix until the consistency is smooth. Blitz it in a blender if you need to dissolve the kabocha chunks.\n\nFor the pie crust\n\nTake the pie dough out of the fridge and place two sheets of parchment paper on the counter. Add a bit more flour to the dough and make a large disc. Place another sheet of parchment paper on top of the cooled dough and roll from the middle outward in all directions. Once the dough is around 3 mm, remove the top sheet of the parchment paper and place a pie pan upside down onto the dough. Place your hand underneath the parchment paper on the counter and shove it into the pie pan and flip over. Drop the crust into the pie pan gently (don\u2019t shove as this will shrink the crust) tapping it into place. Cut the excess crust off, make your favorite design, and pour the pie mixture into the pie pan.\n\nBake in a 180C (or 350F) oven for around 35 minutes or until the center of the pie doesn\u2019t jiggle. Leave out overnight. Add a dollop (the bigger the better) just because.\n\nThis pie is slightly more grainy than pumpkin and it\u2019s not as orange, but you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by how much it looks and tastes like home. Happy October, everyone.\n\nUsing this recipe?
