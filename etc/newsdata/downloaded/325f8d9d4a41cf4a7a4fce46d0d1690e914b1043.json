We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong. We own that, and we are fixing them. We have developed improvements to the 737 Max to ensure that accidents like these never happen again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe also are learning deeper lessons that will result in improvements in the design of future airplanes. As painful as it can be, the process of learning from failure, and even from tragedies like these, has been essential to the advances in airplane safety since the industry began roughly a century ago,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut the criticism from lawmakers was withering.\n\nSenators expressed anger that Boeing reportedly approved the design of the 737 Max despite concerns from their own pilots and did not act more quickly to address the problems after the Lion Air crash in October 2018. Five months later, another 737 Max, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, crashed, killing 157.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) grilled Muilenburg, saying that since the crashes his \"anger has only grown.\" He told the CEO that the victims of the crashes died \u201cas a result of a pattern of deliberate concealment.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal blasted Boeing for initially blaming the crashes on \u201cpilot error,\u201d saying \u201cthose pilots never had a chance, those loved ones never had a chance.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg spoke on the decision not to pull the Max after the first crash with regret.\n\n\u201cI think about that decision over and over again.\u201d\n\nBoeing issued a warning about the MCAS flight control system, which pushed the planes\u2019 noses down, but didn\u2019t ground the jet until the second crash.\n\nCritics have seized on messages from Boeing's chief technical pilot, Mark Forkner in 2016, two years before the first crash, suggesting that there were problems with the MCAS system which contributed to the crashes on the 737 Max, after conducting simulator tests.\n\nHow Boeing handled that information and whether it shared enough with regulators is a key point in the controversy. A government task force earlier this month found that Boeing did not share enough information with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials about the automated plane system in question. The task force concluded that if regulators knew more about how the MCAS Software System worked they might have intensified scrutiny on the 737 Max. MCAS is intended to help stabilize planes, but the task force found that the FAA was not aware of details about changes to the system during development.\n\nIn one email, Forkner said he was \"Jedi mind-tricking\" overseas regulators into certifying the Max model.\n\nBlumenthal asked if Muilenburg was aware that information about the MCAS, or maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, was not fully covered in training manuals.\n\nMuilenburg again tried to offer sympathy to the victims, but Blumenthal sharply responded, \u201cYou\u2019ve done that, and my time is limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you about Boeing policy as reflected in this email, its chief test pilot deciding he was going to mislead pilots who were then going to take passengers into the air and turn these planes into flying coffins,\u201d Blumenthal continued.\n\nLawmakers largely pressed Boeing on its relationship with the FAA. Critics have said the aerospace giant is cozy with regulators, who they say regularly hand off oversight of safety developments to manufacturers.\n\nCommittee Chairman Roger Wicker Roger Frederick WickerHillicon Valley: Zuckerberg defends handling of misinformation in political ads | Biden camp hits Zuckerberg over remarks | Dem bill would jail tech execs for lying about privacy | Consumer safety agency accidentally disclosed personal data Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Pence says Turkey agrees to ceasefire | Senators vow to move forward with Turkey sanctions | Mulvaney walks back comments tying Ukraine aid to 2016 probe On The Money: Senate fails to override Trump veto over border emergency | Trump resort to host G-7 next year | Senators to push Turkey sanctions despite ceasefire | McConnell tees up funding votes MORE (R-Miss.) addressed the perceived coziness between the FAA and the industry, specifically the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program, which allows airlines to self-certify some aspects of airplane development. Supporters say the program has streamlined the regulatory process, but critics worry it could lead to safety lapses.\n\n\u201cWhile the ODA has been used to certify many aircraft over the years, some have criticized the system for permitting an inappropriate relationship between companies and their safety regulator,\u201d Wicker said. The chairman said Forkner's messages \u201creflect a disturbing level of casualness and flippancy that seemed to corroborate these criticisms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe relationship between regulating agencies and the organizations they regulate is important, but so are the internal reforms that Boeing is implementing,\u201d Wicker added.\n\nThe criticism was bipartisan.

Muilenburg was removed as chairman but kept his position as CEO earlier this month.\n\nBlumenthal asked Muilenburg if he would attribute the crashes to regulatory rollbacks that allowed airlines to self-police themselves and whether he would back legislation to beef up the FAA's oversight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll commit to participating in those reform efforts and providing our input,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\n\u201cI think the FAA is part of this problem as well and it is the result at the end of this day of Boeing rushing this process, putting profits over safety, rushing the certification process ... prioritizing speed and cost over safety,\u201d Blumenthal added.\n\nSen.
