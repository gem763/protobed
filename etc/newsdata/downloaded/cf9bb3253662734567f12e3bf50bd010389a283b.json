Bill had recently lost a race for Congress back home in Arkansas, but by the time they returned to the US, he had set his mind to running for Arkansas state attorney general, a decision which would put him on the path to the White House. \u201cWe have had a deep connection to and with Haiti ever since,\u201d Hillary later said.\n\nOver the next four decades, the Clintons became increasingly involved in Haiti, working to reshape the country in profound ways. As US president in the 1990s, Bill lobbied for sweeping changes to Haiti\u2019s agricultural sector that significantly increased the country\u2019s dependence on American food crops. In 1994, three years after a military coup in Haiti, Bill ordered a US invasion that overthrew the junta and restored the country\u2019s democratically elected president to power. Fifteen years later, Bill was appointed United Nations\u2019 special envoy to Haiti, tasked with helping the country to develop its private sector and invigorate its economy. By 2010, the Clintons were two of Haiti\u2019s largest benefactors. Their personal philanthropic fund, The Clinton Foundation, had 34 projects in the country, focused on things such as creating jobs.\n\nOver their many decades of involvement there, the Clintons became two of the leading proponents of a particular approach to improving Haiti\u2019s fortunes, one that relies on making the country an attractive place for multinational companies to do business. They have done this by combining foreign aid with diplomacy, attracting foreign financing to build factories, roads and other infrastructure that, in many cases, Haitian taxpayers must repay. Hillary has called this \u201ceconomic statecraft\u201d; others have called it a \u201cneoliberal\u201d approach to aid.\n\nThe most significant test of this approach in Haiti began on 12 January 2010, when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck just west of the capital, Port-au-Prince. In a nation of 10 million people, 1.6 million were displaced by the disaster, and as many as 316,000 are estimated to have died. The earthquake also dealt a huge blow to Haiti\u2019s economic development, levelling homes and businesses in the most populous area of the country and destroying crucial infrastructure, including the nation\u2019s biggest port.\n\nWithin days of the earthquake, the Clintons stepped up to lead the global response. Bill was selected to co-chair the commission tasked with directing relief spending. As US secretary of state, Hillary helped to oversee $4.4bn that Congress had earmarked for recovery efforts by the US Agency for International Development, or USAid. \u201cAt every stage of Haiti\u2019s reconstruction \u2013 fundraising, oversight and allocation \u2013 a Clinton was now involved,\u201d Jonathan Katz, a journalist who has covered Haiti for more than a decade, wrote in 2015.\n\nThere was no greater embodiment of the neoliberal approach to aid in Haiti than the US\u2019s largest post-earthquake project \u2013 a $300m, 600-acre industrial park called Caracol, on the country\u2019s northern coast. To make the park more attractive, the US also agreed to finance a power plant, and a new port through which firms operating at Caracol could ship in materials such as cotton, and ship out finished products including T-shirts and jeans.\n\nThe Clintons and their allies believed the Caracol project would attract international manufacturers, which they saw as the primary fix to Haiti\u2019s faltering economy. \u201cHaiti has failed, failed and failed again,\u201d wrote the British economist Paul Collier and his colleague Jean-Louis Warnholz, who have both advised the Clintons, in the Financial Times two weeks after the earthquake. By building \u201ccritical assets such as ports\u201d, they argued, the US and its allies could help Haiti attract private, foreign investment and create the stable jobs it needed to prosper.\n\nTen years later, the industrial park is widely considered to have failed to deliver the economic transformation the Clintons promised. But less attention has been paid to the fate of the port. Last year, after sinking tens of millions of dollars into the port project, the US quietly abandoned it. The port is now one of the final failures in an American post-earthquake plan for Haiti that has been characterised by disappointment throughout. It is also the latest in a long line of supposed solutions to Haiti\u2019s woes that have done little \u2013 or worse \u2013 to serve the country\u2019s interests. \u201cThe neoliberal, exploitative economic model currently being imposed\u201d on Haiti \u201chas failed many times before,\u201d Antony Loewenstein, author of Disaster Capitalism: Making a Killing Out of Catastrophe, has written. The result, he adds, is that many Haitians are living \u201cin a state of despair and daily desperation\u201d.\n\nHaiti makes up the western third of the island of Hispaniola \u2013 the other two-thirds are the Dominican Republic \u2013 situated between the Atlantic and the Caribbean along several major international shipping lanes. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategic location,\u201d says Claude Lamothe, the former director of a small port in the northern city of Cap-Ha\u00eftien. \u201cAll the big boats from the US pass right by here.\u201d\n\nFor decades, the vast majority of goods coming to or leaving Haiti travelled through the ageing port at Port-au-Prince in the south. In the 70s, that port handled 90% of Haiti\u2019s imports and 60% of its exports (including thousands of baseballs destined for the US, some for the Major League). But by the late 2000s, the fees it charged companies to dock, load and offload their goods were higher than any other port in the region. So companies turned to ports in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas or Trinidad and Tobago instead. When the earthquake hit, a large section of the port at Port-au-Prince collapsed into the sea. \u201cThe damage was unbelievable,\u201d said Russell Green, a civil engineer at Virginia Tech University, who arrived to survey the port a few weeks after the disaster.\n\nJust before the earthquake hit, Paul Collier had published a report for the UN that laid out a vision for Haiti in which international manufacturing and trade would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in a few short years and drive the country\u2019s economy into the future. His plan was a particularly clear expression of the neoliberal prescription for aid: reduce taxes on businesses to attract foreign investment, reduce tariffs to make it cheaper to buy and sell goods and offer loans to finance the infrastructure necessary to accommodate the rest. All this would create jobs, and these new wage-earners would then spend their money on goods from abroad. Everybody, in theory, would win.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Port-au-Prince in Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake.

There were several obvious locations for it in and around the earthquake-devastated capital, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people would have provided a ready workforce. Ultimately, however, USAid decided to build the park and port near Cap-Ha\u00eftien, on the country\u2019s northern coast, 650 miles south-east of Miami, Florida.\n\nA 2011 US government report declared: \u201cWith its proximity to Miami, a new container port in this region could become a hub for the north,\u201d which had \u201cuntapped potential\u201d in light manufacturing, such as garments, and in certain kinds of high-value agriculture. Companies such as the major Korean textile manufacturer Sae-A, which became one of Caracol\u2019s first tenants, would be able to ship in cotton and ship out apparel. \u201cA port \u2013 that was the carrot for these companies,\u201d Jake Johnston, a Haiti expert at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), a liberal thinktank, told me.\n\nBut the location was attractive for other reasons, too. \u201cLand was readily available in the north,\u201d and the \u201chundreds of small farmers who had to be moved\u201d to make way for the park and port \u201cwere far less resistant than the wealthy landowners in the capital,\u201d Johnston wrote in 2014. Members of Haiti\u2019s northern elite were also lobbying Bill Clinton to invest in the region, says Leslie Voltaire, who served alongside Bill as Haiti\u2019s special envoy to the UN from 2009 to 2010.\n\nHaitians themselves had remarkably little control over these plans. Between April 2010 and October 2011, decisions about how to rebuild Haiti were made not by Haiti\u2019s parliament, but by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, which Bill co-chaired. This was supposed to be a Haitian-led body, but in December 2010, the 12 Haitian members of the committee wrote a letter declaring: \u201cIn reality, Haitian members of the board have one role: to endorse the decisions made by the director and executive committee,\u201d which included donors and other Clinton allies.\n\nHaiti\u2019s then-president, a musician-turned politician named Michel Martelly, seemed reluctant to push back against the US\u2019s redevelopment ideas, according to Voltaire. \u201cAt that time, Clinton was very close to Martelly,\u201d he told me. \u201cMartelly is an amateur and he respects Clinton\u2019s ideas. They would follow whatever USAid and Clinton would say.\u201d (Martelly did not respond to a request for an interview.)\n\n\u201cYou have to put it in context,\u201d Voltaire continued. \u201cAlmost all the countries in the world would want someone like Bill Clinton to be a lobbyist for his country.\u201d A former US president with ties to major investors across the globe was expending political capital to help Haiti rebuild. For Haiti, \u201cit was a double asset,\u201d Voltaire went on, \u201cbecause his wife was secretary of state,\u201d and had influence over USAid, which controlled most of the US\u2019s post-earthquake spending.\n\nIn the months after the earthquake, Bill worked tirelessly to attract manufacturing companies to the Caracol industrial park. When construction on the park broke ground in 2011, Bill laid the first foundation stone. A year later, at the park\u2019s opening ceremony, Bill looked on as Hillary delivered a speech promising that the park would lead Haiti toward economic independence.\n\nInternational trade has dictated Haiti\u2019s economy almost since Christopher Columbus landed on Hispaniola by mistake, in 1492. After Spain and later France colonised the island, they imported African slaves to produce one of the most lucrative commodities in history \u2013 sugar \u2013 and exported it around the globe. By the eve of Haiti\u2019s independence, which Haitians won in 1804, global trade had made the country one of the most profitable pieces of land in the world.\n\nBut all this international commerce has rarely benefited the vast majority of Haitians. Little of the wealth generated in the country has ever stayed there. For almost its entire history, Haiti has owed a trade debt to other nations \u2013 most notably, a $21bn (in today\u2019s money) burden levied by France after independence. During the two centuries that followed, the effect of these debts has been to severely impoverish the country, and to make it beholden to the rich nations who have acted as its creditors. In the past 100 years, the US and the international financial institutions it partners with have been the most important of these creditors, indebting Haiti by extending foreign development loans and creating a trade imbalance \u2013 an early form of the neoliberal model.\n\nBut what worked for the US\u2019s interests worked less well for Haiti. By the 1950s, neither Haiti\u2019s agricultural economy, nor the dollars spent by thousands of American tourists every year, was enough to pay back those debts. By 1961, the US was sending $13m in aid to Haiti \u2013 half Haiti\u2019s national budget \u2013 in part to help the nation bolster industry. Much of this early US aid to Haiti was looted or wasted by Haiti\u2019s autocratic leaders, especially Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier, and his son, Jean-Claude, who spent it on personal militias that terrorised Haiti\u2019s citizenry. \u201cSince 1946, the United States has poured about $100m in economic aid \u2026 into Haiti without much to show for the money,\u201d the New York Times reported in 1963.\n\nAid from the US and loans from international financial institutions failed to lift Haiti out of poverty. And yet, American aid kept pouring in. When the Clintons and their allies sought to mould Haiti\u2019s economic future around manufacturing and trade, it was essentially the same neoliberal programme that the US had been pushing for decades.\n\nThe most pernicious part of this programme was the agricultural policies that the US imposed on Haiti beginning in the 70s. The US pressured Haiti to reduce its tariffs on imported crops, then shipped surplus American crops into Haiti\u2019s ports under the guise of \u201cfood aid\u201d. Haitian farmers could not compete with all the artificially cheap rice and other food crops from abroad, which was part of the point. The strategy was to create another market for American farmers while pushing Haiti\u2019s labour force away from the fields and into factories. As president, Bill Clinton furthered this programme, creating massive surpluses of crops such as rice by extending hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to US farmers. In Haiti, the result was that thousands upon thousands of farmers lost their land, but industrialisation never moved fast enough to replace their livelihoods.\n\nOnly years later would Bill Clinton acknowledge how this policy had failed Haitians.\u201cThe United States has followed a policy \u2026 that we rich countries that produce a lot of food should sell it to poor countries and relieve them of the burden of producing their own food, so, thank goodness, they can leap directly into the industrial era,\u201d he told Congress in 2010. \u201cIt may have been good for some of my farmers in Arkansas, but it has not worked \u2026 I have to live every day with the consequences of the lost capacity to produce a rice crop in Haiti to feed those people.\u201d By the time the earthquake struck, in 2010, a nation that in the 70s grew enough rice to feed itself was now importing 80% of it from abroad.\n\n\u201cArtibonite used to be rich, but now it\u2019s poor,\u201d Denis Jesu-car, a rice farmer in one of Haiti\u2019s most agriculturally rich regions, once explained to me. \u201cWe produce rice, but it doesn\u2019t sell.\u201d\n\nDespite his acknowledgement that the US\u2019s prior attempt to liberalise Haiti\u2019s economy had decimated its agricultural sector, in 2010, after the earthquake struck, Bill Clinton and his allies prescribed the same, familiar medicine \u2013 this time in the form of construction projects and clothing, instead of rice.\n\nOne year later, Bill presided over a conference at which building firms from across the globe presented their designs for permanent housing for the displaced, most of which never came to fruition, in part because many were financially or practically infeasible, and in part for lack of land on which to build them. The largest piece of real estate of Haiti\u2019s post-earthquake reconstruction was not built for poor Haitians at all, but for wealthy ones and foreigners: a new Marriott hotel in Port-au-Prince, financed by a multinational telecoms corporation whose chairman was a friend of Clinton\u2019s. The Clinton Foundation brokered the deal, and Bill inaugurated the hotel in 2015.\n\nThe flagship projects of Haiti\u2019s reconstruction were the Caracol industrial park and a power plant and new port that were to come with it. \u201cEach must be completed and remain viable for the others to succeed,\u201d the US Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019s official financial watchdog, wrote in an audit of the project in 2013. But the audit also found that USAid, which was leading the port project, lacked \u201cstaff with technical expertise in planning, construction, and oversight of a port.\u201d USAid, the audit pointed out, \u201chas not constructed a port anywhere in the world since the 70s\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Former US president Bill Clinton visiting a new power plant in Caracol, Haiti, in 2012. Photograph: Larry Downing/AP\n\nThe audit offered a damning account of USAid\u2019s efforts to build the port. Construction was delayed from the start. The time needed to build the port was revised from an initial estimate of two-and-a-half years to 10 years \u2013 and then indefinitely. USAid had \u201cno current projection for when construction of the port may begin or how long it will take\u201d. This was \u201cdue in part to a lack of USAid expertise in port planning in Haiti\u201d.\n\nTo make matters worse, in June 2015, a USAid feasibility study found that \u201ca new port was not viable for a variety of technical, environmental and economic reasons\u201d. What\u2019s more, the US did not have enough money to finish the job: \u201cUSAid funding will be insufficient to cover a majority of projected costs,\u201d with an \u201cestimated gap\u201d of $117m to $189m. Not only was the port not viable, it was not even wanted: the private companies USAid had hoped to attract to Haiti\u2019s north \u201chad no interest in supporting the construction of a new port in northern Haiti\u201d, the feasibility study determined.\n\nWhile the port stalled, the industrial park underdelivered. When Bill and Hillary Clinton flew to northern Haiti to inaugurate the $300m Caracol park in 2012, the overall project had created just 1,500 of the 65,000 jobs that were promised. In fact, many Haitians may have lost their livelihoods because of Caracol: in the end, 366 families were evicted from their land to make way for the project, according to a report by the NGO ActionAid. By June 2017, Caracol still employed only 13,000 people. (In an email, the Clinton Foundation wrote that \u201cThe Clinton Foundation did not have a role in building the Caracol Industrial Park and has never invested any funds into the park,\u201d but acknowledged that as part of its wider goal of facilitating investment in Haiti, \u201cthe Foundation helped identify potential tenants, including Haitian companies, for the park\u201d.)\n\nAs the US\u2019s failure to deliver on its promises for the industrial park made international headlines, the faltering plans for the new port went overlooked. In 2013, USAid reallocated almost all of the $72m that was supposed to be used to build a new port to instead expand and modernise the small, dilapidated port in nearby Cap-Ha\u00eftien. US officials knew they were throwing good money after bad: two years prior, a study by the State Department concluded it would be a bad idea to attempt to expand that port because there simply was not enough land on which to do so.\n\nThe Cap-Ha\u00eftien port \u201cis locked into the city\u201d, Voltaire said. \u201cThere is no way you can expand the hangers, the customs, the container areas. There\u2019s not enough space.\u201d But USAid officials went ahead with it anyway. \u201cTo scrap it or to stop allocating money is to admit failure,\u201d Johnston, the Haiti researcher said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not something that USAid is good at.\u201d\n\nFinally, more than seven years after the port was conceived, USAid confronted reality. In May 2018, almost three years after a new port was originally supposed to be completed, USAid entirely abandoned its plans to build a new port or expand the old one. In August, a spokesperson explained the decision to me: \u201cBased on proposals received and the current marketplace, it appeared that the cost of the project would significantly exceed the business forecast, cost estimate and available funding.\u201d In short, a port was simply not economically viable. Which was precisely the conclusion that US audits and reports had come to dating back to 2011 \u2013 reports that USAid had ignored.\n\nAfter the project was abandoned, US officials did not even bother to tell Haiti the news. When I visited Cap-Ha\u00eftien in December, Haitian port authorities were unaware that USAid had scrapped the project. \u201cLast conversation we had, they told us the money is there,\u201d Anacl\u00e9 Gerv\u00e8, the director of the Cap-Ha\u00eftien port, said. I told him what a USAid official told me: it had decided to cancel the port project six months earlier. Gerv\u00e8 leaned back in his chair. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us that.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Gerv\u00e8 what the US\u2019s $70m had achieved, he pointed to two concrete electricity poles, erected as part of a plan to connect the port to the public grid. USAid had paid for the poles, but had not strung the cables needed to electrify them.\n\nBy January 2019, nine years after the earthquake, USAid had spent $2.3bn in Haiti. Most of it was given to American companies and hardly any passed through Haitian hands. Less than 3% of that spending went directly to Haitian organisations or firms, according to research by CEPR. In contrast, 55% of the money went to American companies located in and around Washington DC. Most likely, according to the research, the majority of what USAid allegedly spent on Haiti\u2019s recovery ended right back in the US.\n\nIt is not clear what happened to the money allocated for a port in Haiti, because USAid would not tell me. In August, it released a factsheet claiming that it still planned to invest in \u201cinfrastructure upgrades\u201d at the port, such as \u201cimproving the electricity system\u201d. Some of these were things the agency had committed to doing previously, but that had yet to be achieved by the time I visited last December. The factsheet gave no indication of how much money was being directed to these projects, or when they would be completed. In other words, even after abandoning the idea of building a new port in favour of expanding the old one, then abandoning plans to expand the old one, too, USAid is still making new promises, still claiming it will at least do something, despite its failure to make good on earlier promises dating back almost a decade. The only physical improvements the agency claims to have made at the port are \u201celectrical lines, security wall upgrades, a pilot boat and a security card machine\u201d. It also claims to have trained 575 Haitian customs officers, but did not say how many of them are employed at the Cap-Ha\u00eftien port.\n\nOver the past 12 months, I have repeatedly asked USAid spokespeople for a breakdown as to how the $70m allocated to the Cap-Ha\u00eftien port was ultimately spent. In July 2018, I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for documents relating to the port expenditures, and last October I resubmitted the request in further detail after discussing it on the phone with a USAid official. The agency acknowledged my request, but has yet to send me a single document in response to it.\n\n\u201cSeventy million dollars? It\u2019s a lot of money\u201d for a project that never materialised, said Voltaire. For that amount, \u201cwe could have a nice port in Saint-Marc\u201d, just a few miles north-west of Haiti\u2019s capital. In Canaan, a new city on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince that was formed after the earthquake, he added, \u201cthey could do 72km of nice road, or 72 primary schools,\u201d with all that money. At the end of last year, Canaan \u2013 which is now Haiti\u2019s third-largest city \u2013 had fewer than 5km of paved roads and just one public school, for a population of 300,000.\n\n\u201cHere you have an industrial park an eight-hour drive north from where the quake was,\u201d said Johnston, referring to Caracol. \u201cAnd then you have this city that\u2019s just 8km north, that was created from the earthquake \u2013 and it\u2019s gotten nothing.\u201d\n\nIn post-earthquake Haiti, there were all manner of things the US could have spent its money on. It could have spent that money to revitalise Haiti\u2019s agricultural sector. In a country where only one in four people have access to basic sanitation facilities, the US could have invested in building things such as flush toilets, sewers and sewage treatment plants. In a country where 59% of the population lives on less than $2.41 per day, the US could have simply given Haitians the money. Studies have shown that such \u201cunconditional cash transfers\u201d can be a more effective way to increase income and access to education and housing than many types of traditional \u201cproject-based\u201d aid. But policies like cash transfers would have undermined the approach to aid in which rich countries simply prescribe \u201csolutions\u201d for poor ones, rather than allowing people to take their futures into their own hands.\n\nIs fair trade finished? Read more\n\nLittle about the US\u2019s foreign policy toward Haiti has changed since the 2010 earthquake. The US continues to send the country surplus crops through the Food for Peace programme to this day. Hillary Clinton stepped down as US secretary of state in 2013, but her successors have championed the same sort of private-sector-focused development. USAid continues to spend money to boost Haiti\u2019s textile industry, and the US government continues to advertise Haiti as a business opportunity for US investors.\n\nIn spite of its failures to ring in a new era of prosperity for Haiti by building an industrial park and a port, the US is undeterred in its belief that industry and manufacturing are the key to Haiti\u2019s future. \u201cDespite the challenges, there are opportunities in the Haitian market for small-to-medium-sized US businesses,\u201d wrote the US Department of Commerce in August. \u201cThe apparel sector is the most promising opportunity in the manufacturing sector in Haiti.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "description": "The long read: After an earthquake struck in 2010, the US pledged to help rebuild the Caribbean country.
