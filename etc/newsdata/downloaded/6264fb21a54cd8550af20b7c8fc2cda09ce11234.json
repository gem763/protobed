They traveled part of the way in a boat between river banks thick with vegetation.\n\nKadjyre Kayapo is head of Krimej village, where villagers run a surveillance operation that tries to monitor incursions into indigenous territory.\n\n\u201cI founded this village to prevent the loggers getting into our territory,\u201d said the leader, who wore a traditional headdressQ and a necklace reading \u201cJesus Christ\u201d in Kayapo language.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro contends that past allocations of land to indigenous people, many of whom live in the Amazon rainforest, were excessive. About 14% of Brazil is indigenous territory, a huge area for those groups\u2019 relatively small numbers, the president said.\n\nBolsonaro has faced criticism for saying rainforest protections are blocking Brazil\u2019s economic development. He has said European countries expressing concern have done enough damage to the environment themselves and should focus on their own reforestation.\n\nThe Brazilian Amazon saw 30,901 fires in August, the highest for the month since 2010, according to the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research.\n\nThe data released Sunday said there was a 196% increase in fires in comparison to August of last year. In August 2010, there were 45,018 fires. Fires are most common in the Amazon from August through October, during the dry season.\n\nMuch of the deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is done illegally. Landgrabbers practice slash-and-burn techniques to clear forest for agriculture and loggers encroach on national forests and indigenous reserves.\n\nBrazil contains about 60% of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An indigenous leader in Brazil's Amazon says he will do what he can to stop loggers and prospectors encroaching on his people's land.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Leo Correa"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/aptopix_brazil_amazon_fires_10032_c0-167-4000-2499_s1770x1032.jpg?0ff70703b128ca503aced402a7d61935364c4e5a"}
