Failed states, complex democratic transitions and extremely difficult demographic transitions.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

So the transformation plan that we have to conduct together must be developed according to African interests by and with African leaders.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt of his speech on Saturday went largely unnoticed during the wide-ranging G20 summit, which saw violent protests erupt in Hamburg. But an edited clip of his response being shared on social media has since provoked outrage, with critics accusing the French President of blaming women for poverty and buying into racial stereotypes.\n\nFrance\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration newspaper pointed to research by a prominent political scientist concluding that blaming overpopulation for poverty, and African women for overpopulation, distracted from the role of former colonial powers like France and the UK.\n\nFran\u00e7oise Verg\u00e8s\u2019 book also highlighted abuses by white French doctors who sterilised black women and induced abortions without their consent in the colony of Reunion in the 1970s. \u201cThird World women are made responsible for underdevelopment [but] most studies show today that it is underdevelopment that causes overpopulation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe theory of overpopulation also avoids questioning the role of colonialism and imperialism in poverty.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Writing for South Africa\u2019s Daily Vox website, Mishka Wazar said: \u201cAfrica is not a country. You cannot, as a world leader (or even an ordinary person on the streets with no political ambitions) conflate African countries with \u2018Africa\u2019.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
