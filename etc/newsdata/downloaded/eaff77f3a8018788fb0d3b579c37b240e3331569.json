Bournemouth are ticking along nicely and will play on the counter-attack, but they don\u2019t tend to get results on the road away at the big sides. \u2018But with Arsenal\u2019s defence is still very fragile, this is another dangerous game for the Gunners. \u2018They should just have enough to get the win, but then again if Arsenal are one thing, they are surprising.\u2019 Arsenal 3-1 Bournemouth\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMan City vs Wolves, 2pm \u2018Wolves can be awkward, but Manchester City should have a comfortable afternoon. City are brilliant to watch, and they are only just getting started. \u2018Wolves are a dangerous side and they got their first win last week, but by the time they have come from Thursday\u2019s tough trip to Besiktas, it may be too much for Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s side.\u2019 Man City 3-1 Wolves\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSouthampton vs Chelsea, 2pm \u2018This is another good test for Southampton, who were decent against Tottenham. Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham have been praised, and rightly so. \u2018Abraham has earned his first England call-up, rightly so too. Chelsea are sitting in seventh which is acceptable \u2013 it is tight at the moment. \u2018It will be a season full of ups and downs for the Blues and with lots of games coming up for their youngsters, it may just take its toll on occasions.\u2019 Southampton 1-1 Chelsea\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nNewcastle vs Man Utd, 4.30pm \u2018Steve Bruce goes up against his old team \u2013 it is an intriguing one. The last time Newcastle were at home, they were dreadful. \u2018You have to give the fans something at home, they are an amazing bunch of supporters. Manchester United are sitting in 10th with two wins in seven, scrambling for points at home. \u2018There is a lot of demands in place but Solskjaer has his plan for the youth and the club. His vision will take time. \u2018One week, Newcastle will surprise everybody, and this may be this week. If they hit them and are aggressive, they can shock Manchester United.\u2019 Newcastle 2-1 Man Utd", "description": "Charlie Nicholas expects his former club Arsenal to prove too strong for Bournemouth on Sunday and is backing Newcastle to inflict more misery on Manchester United.
