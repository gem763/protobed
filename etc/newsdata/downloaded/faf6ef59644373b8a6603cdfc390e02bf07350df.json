Lengoasa was suspended in September 2018 on full pay.\n\n\"The committee would like to see this matter resolved speedily as it is costing taxpayers because the official is suspended on full pay. The previous CEO that was suspended, cost taxpayers R2m.\" Former CEO Linda Makuleni was axed in 2016.\n\nAccording to the SAWS Annual Report, its employee compensation increased by 17.46% year-on-year to R261.34m, making up 57.63% of total expenditure.\n\nAdministrative Expenditure increased by R7.12m year-on-year from R9.32m to R16.43m, mainly as a result of increased provision for doubtful debts, which amounted to R5.21m for the year.\n\nBut the weather service also noted achievements despite facing challenges.\n\nAccording to its annual report, it issued 1 171 severe-weather warnings during the year and exceeded its targets in terms of accuracy and probability of detection.\n\nIt has also previously cited inadequate equipment as a factor where it has delivered inaccurate storm warnings, News24 reported.\n\nAuditor General Kimi Makwetu said the qualified audit was on the basis that the SAWS did not correctly account for estimates to property, plant and equipment, and did not take into account all financial commitments, among other things.", "description": "Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Environment, Forestry and Fisheries has slammed the South African Weather Service for receiving a qualified audit opinion for the 2018/2019 year.", "authors": ["Marelise Van Der Merwe"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2421/71aadde594204e38ba4403111b839427.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
