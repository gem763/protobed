Brown, too, had point guard experience on his resume and might have helped in that area on a temporary basis.\n\nWithout either of them available, Ish Smith figures to be Washington\u2019s starting point guard on opening night on Oct. 23 in Dallas against the Mavericks, though Bradley Beal could help with ball-handling duties too.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. The Wizards\u2018 first-round pick this year, forward Rui Hachimura, played for Japan in the FIBA World Cup, and dropped out of the final two games earlier this month due to \u201cknee discomfort and general fatigue.\u201d But that isn\u2019t expected to linger or become anything more serious.\n\nYet another offseason addition for the Wizards was swingman C.J. Miles, acquired via the trade in July that sent Dwight Howard out of town. Miles underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left foot a few weeks after the trade. He originally injured that foot during the 2018-19 season playing for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nAt the time, the Wizards said an update on Miles\u2019 recovery would be given in six weeks\u2019 time, but that has yet to come. Sheppard is scheduled to meet with the media Thursday.\n\nAdded together, this means the Wizards could be down as many as three rotational players for their season opener. And that\u2019s not even counting Wall.\n\nThe star guard on the supermax deal is still months away from playing in an NBA game, in the rosiest outlook, and he could miss all of 2019-20. But his rehab from Achilles surgery is coming along; at a Mystics playoff game last week, Wall told NBC Sports Washington that he began taking jump shots and working on ball-handling.\n\nWizards owner Ted Leonsis said over the summer that Wall would \u201cprobably\u201d miss the full season, and no one on the team wants to risk rushing him back. Still, the injury problems could just be getting started in Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
