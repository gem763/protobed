Now, thanks to the effortlessly great Double J, the story of the Big Day Out\u2019s rise to the top of the Australian music mountain \u2013 as well as its ultimate and rather ugly fall \u2013 is being charted thanks to a new in-depth, behind-the-scenes podcast series.\n\nThe five-part series Inside The Big Day Out launches today, with each episode set to chart a different, crucial period in the life-cycle of the festival, which began as a single-day event in Sydney in 1992, after what was originally supposed to be a Violent Femmes headlining tour suddenly exploded in interest because the chief support band, some unknown US group by the name of Nirvana, released a reasonably popular album called Nevermind.\n\nOver the course of the five episodes, host Gemma Pike is delving into key moments in the festival\u2019s history, from the explosion of Silverchair and the wild stories from the festival\u2019s halcyon days, to the tragic death of Jessica Michalik during Limp Bizkit\u2018s infamous set in Sydney at the 2001 festival, through to the dissolution of the working relationship between festival founders Ken West and Vivian Lees and, ultimately, the decline and fall of the festival via sales to AJ Maddah and then subsequently to American booking group C3.\n\nEpisodes are set to be released weekly beginning today, and will featuring input from perennial BDO artists like Cosmic Psychos, The Living End, Grinspoon, Eskimo Joe, Frenzal Rhomb, Powderfinger, Magic Dirt, You Am I, the Violent Femmes, Jebediah, and Shihad, as well as from Lees, West, Maddah, and other key behind-the-scenes figures.\n\nYou can get at the podcast via all your usual podcast outlets, as well as via the Triple J app and Double J website.", "description": "Since its demise in 2014, the Big Day Out has left a sizeable hole in the Australian festival schedule.
