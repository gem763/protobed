Wary of simmering public anger after months of anti-government protests this year, Macron said last week he preferred benefits to be determined by the duration of a person's career, rather than the age at which they retire.\n\nThe talks on Thursday and Friday with uneasy union leaders and Prime Minister Philippe Edouard kick off wide-ranging consultations with professions like teaching and nursing on what could be a defining reform of Macron's presidency.\n\n(Reporting by Michel Rose; editing by Richard Lough and Ed Osmond)", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron is drafting his special advisor on pension reform into government, giving Jean-Paul Delevoye added authority to negotiate with unions the most perilous leg of his reform drive so far.
