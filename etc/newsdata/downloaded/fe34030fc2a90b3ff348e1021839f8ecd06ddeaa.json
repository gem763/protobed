It\u2019s one of many Amazon centres around the world where \u201cdata associates\u201d prepare millions of chunks of data to train Alexa\u2019s AI.\n\nThe work can be relentless, says a former employee. He was crunching roughly 700 Alexa questions a day with strict benchmarks for how long each should take. Workers\u2019 performance figures were circulated daily and targets crept up over the time he spent there. The work was monotonous, but the volume and pace were mentally exhausting, and he eventually quit.\n\n\u201cIt's not possible to work like a machine every day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe system is built in such a way that every time you have to give 100%. From the point of a human, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d\n\nTo users, digital assistants, search engines, social media and streaming services seem like software wizardry, but their smooth running relies on armies of humans whose contribution often goes unrecognised.", "description": "Armies of workers help power the technological wizardry that is reshaping our lives \u2013 but they are invisible and their jobs are precarious.", "authors": ["Edd Gent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7l/wk/p07lwk1f.jpg"}
