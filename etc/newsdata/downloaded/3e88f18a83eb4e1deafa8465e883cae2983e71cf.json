Those not familiar with Bardugo, or even YA literature, will still be delighted by this dark novel.\n\nSet on the campus of Yale, \"Ninth House\" imagines that the school's secret societies are no longer just boys clubs but groups that create dark magic to manipulate stock markets and The New York Timesbestseller list, see into the future and more. Alex Stern is a freshman when she enters Yale\u2019s dangerous Lethe House, one of nine secret societies that practice magic; it polices the other houses on campus.\n\n\u201cNinth House,\u201d by Leigh Bardugo. (Photo: Flatiron)\n\nAlex is not another privileged student from a wealthy or even middle-class family. In fact, Alex would have never entered Lethe House or even stepped into the Ivy League world if not for the fact that she can see ghosts, or \u201cGreys,\u201d as they are called. If anything, Alex would have been another victim of the opioid epidemic if the members of Lethe had never found her in the hospital and invited her to Yale.\n\nShe is mentored by Darlington, a upperclassman who trains Alex in the dark arts until he mysteriously disappears at the end of her first semester. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, just as the spring semester starts, a young lower-income woman from New Haven, Connecticut, is discovered dead on campus. As part of Lethe House, Alex must investigate whether the murder and disappearance of Darlington have anything to do with the magic that lurks on campus.\n\nMore: 'The Giver of Stars' is Jojo Moyes' stellar celebration of the power of reading\n\n\"Ninth House\" is as much a fantasy murder-mystery as it is an exploration of white privilege, corruption, misogyny and trauma. Bardugo highlights the vast gap between the lower-income neighborhoods that surround the campus and the toxic wealth hoarding of the school's most privileged students. New Haven itself is a character in the novel, one that never willingly bends to magic or wealth even as it drastically changes through gentrification.\n\nThe novel alternates between Alex's and Darlington's perspectives from the first semester to the second in Alex\u2019s first year. As Alex sees the opportunity of a safe, more stable life for herself, she might have to trade it all for the truth.\n\n\"Ninth House\" sometimes loses its characters' voices in the dense plot. The theme of privilege is so interwoven throughout the story that the book challenges readers to examine their own environment without being overtly on the nose. It helps that Alex is a straight-shooting, instinct-driven character who understands the game she is in more than the gamemakers themselves.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/08/leigh-bardugo-ninth-house-fantasy-book-review/3902590002/", "description": "\"Shadow and Bone\" author Leigh Bardugo makes the leap from YA in her first adult novel, \"Ninth House,\" a dark fantasy that explores class and magic.", "authors": ["Delfina V Barbiero", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Vince Flynn", "Kyle Mills", "Rick Riordan", "Demi Moore", "Bill O'Reilly", "Published P.M.
