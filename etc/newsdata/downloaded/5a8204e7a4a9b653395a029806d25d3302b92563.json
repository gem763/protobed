Well, today we did it,\u201d Draghi told a news conference.\n\nYet there were doubts, even within the ECB itself, as to whether the latest measures \u2014 most of the few remaining tools in its monetary policy arsenal \u2014 would be enough to stoke a euro zone recovery in the face of a U.S.-China trade war and possible disruption from Brexit.\n\nDraghi faced faced pushback from the representatives of Germany and France as well as at least one of his own board members when he pushed for resuming the ECB\u2019s bond-buying program, three sources told Reuters.\n\nThursday\u2019s moves also infuriated Trump, who just this week called on the U.S. Fed to adopt a negative-rate policy.\n\n\u201cThey are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nLAGARDE CONSTRAINED\n\nA 10 basis point cut in the ECB\u2019s deposit rate to -0.5% was fully expected but the revived bond purchases exceeded many expectations because they are set to run until \u201cshortly before\u201d the ECB raises interest rates.\n\nGiven that markets do not expect rates to rise for nearly a decade, such a formulation suggests that purchases could go on for years, possibly through most of Christine Lagarde\u2019s term leading the bank.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decisions have anchored and enshrined the Draghi legacy in future ECB decisions,\u201d ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes has just been extended by as long as it takes,\u201d Brzeski said, referring to the 2012 speech in which Draghi promised to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, a bold move credited with holding the crisis-hit bloc together.\n\nWhile conservative ECB policymakers had spoken out against more bond purchases in recent weeks, the decision suggests some of them eventually agreed, giving Draghi a majority for what is probably his last major policy move.\n\nUnderlining the need for action, the ECB cut its growth projections for this year and next, predicting growth at just above 1%, below what is considered its natural potential.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s decision triggered a rally in euro zone bonds that will cut the cost of borrowing across the 19 countries that use the euro. The single currency itself firmed a touch after wild price swings during Draghi\u2019s news conference.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi attends a news conference on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council, in Frankfurt, Germany, September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nEFFECTIVE?\n\nA simple rate cut would have increased the cost to commercial banks of parking their more than 1 trillion euros worth of excess reserves safely at the ECB, a dangerous move since banks transmit the bulk of its policy to the real economy.\n\nTo offset that burden, the ECB promised even cheaper long-term funding and said it would introduce a multi-tier deposit rate to shield them from some of the charge. That could leave lenders about 2 billions of euros a year better off than previously, according to some estimates.\n\nYet the size and design of the scheme underwhelmed bankers whose own loans are being offered at rock-bottom rates.\n\n\u201cEven if the tiered interest rate introduced today provides some relief, European banks will continue to have to pay billions to the ECB every year as some sort of penalty charge tax,\u201d Hans-Walter Peters, president of the German banking association, said.\n\nEuro zone stocks were little changed on Thursday, however, highlighting investors\u2019 doubts about the effectiveness of ECB policy, which can only prop up domestic confidence, not deliver a U.S.-China trade deal or seal a Brexit agreement.\n\nIndeed, Draghi stepped up his rhetoric in calling for governments to spend their way out of a slowdown, singling out Germany, which is obsessed with running a balanced budget.\n\n\u201cNow it is high time for the fiscal policy to take charge,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cThere was unanimity, namely that fiscal policy should become the main instrument.\u201d\n\nDraghi has called for years for governments to do more to stimulate growth.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Sign of the European Central Bank (ECB) is seen ahead of a news conference on the outcome of the Governing Council meeting, outside the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, March 7, 2019.

Deeply negative interest rates could push up saving rates \u2014 see the surge in German savings, for instance,\u201d Shweta Singh, a managing director at TS Lombard, said.\n\n\u201cCrucially, there may be much less scope this time for the euro to edge lower and thus boost inflation expectations.\u201d", "description": "European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi pledged indefinite stimulus on Thursday to revive an ailing euro zone economy, tying the hands of his successor for years to come and sparking an immediate conflict with U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429069429&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B12S", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
