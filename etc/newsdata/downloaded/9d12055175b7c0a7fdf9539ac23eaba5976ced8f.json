A poll by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai published Wednesday said the trade war was weighing on its members\u2019 projections for revenue growth, optimism about the future and future investment plans. Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that the trade war has already cost 300,000 American jobs, a toll that could increase to nearly 450,000 by the end of this year and nearly 900,000 jobs by the end of next year, assuming Mr. Trump\u2019s planned tariff increases go into effect.\n\nIn recent months, some of the focus has shifted away from the terms of the trade deal itself to whether there can be an interim agreement that would involve Chinese purchases of American agricultural products and smooth over relations between the countries.\n\nChinese officials and their contacts have floated the idea of restarting agricultural purchases, in return for the United States postponing further tariff increases and offering some relief for Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that has been blacklisted from buying American products, several people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMr. Trump has been deeply frustrated by China\u2019s refusal to purchase American agricultural products in recent months. The move would help the president by buoying a constituency that is important for him politically and also increasingly opposed to the trade war.\n\nBut such an interim agreement has also proved elusive. The president and his advisers are increasingly aware of the national security risk posed by Huawei, and cognizant that they would face criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike if they relent. Companies have submitted more than 120 applications to the Commerce Department to supply certain nonsensitive products to Huawei, but no applications have yet been approved.\n\nAmerican officials may consider removing some tariffs in return for economic concessions from China, but they are unlikely to do so for agricultural purchases, Mr. Trump\u2019s allies say.\n\nThe Chinese, meanwhile, know that agricultural purchases would reduce the political pressure on Mr. Trump and potentially increase his chances of re-election, and they are not likely to trade away this source of leverage easily, people familiar with their thinking said.", "description": "President Trump said the United States would delay its next planned tariff hike on China by two weeks, potentially giving negotiators a window to avoid the increase.", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/business/11dc-trade1alt/merlin_160194810_fb6a4648-f885-408d-85cd-5dda628b8b5f-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
