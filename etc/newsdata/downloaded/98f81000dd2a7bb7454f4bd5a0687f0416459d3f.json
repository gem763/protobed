But the office of then-Attorney General Kamala Harris wasn\u2019t ready to let him off the hook.\n\nDiaz was convicted in 1984 of rape and attempted rape. He was paroled in 1993, became a registered sex offender, and began the work of proving his innocence. It took 19 years for his conviction to be reversed -- and two more years for the State of California to grant him compensation for the time he was wrongfully imprisoned.\n\nDiaz\u2019s battle with Harris\u2019 office began in 2012 when a judge reversed his conviction. As state attorney general, her staff vigorously resisted his claim for compensation and tried to make him re-register as a sex offender, despite a formal ruling in April 2013 that he was innocent.\n\nThe Diaz case is one of a series of battles Harris\u2019 prosecutors waged -- in both the offices of San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general -- to resist innocence claims, often using technical timeliness or jurisdictional arguments, lawyers and innocence advocates say.\n\nBending Toward Justice\n\n\u201cThe goal is justice,\u201d said Gerald Schwartzbach, Diaz\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t just rules, regulations and procedures. They penalized an innocent man with technical arguments. To me that\u2019s fundamentally contradictory to the whole purpose of the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nHarris is now a U.S. senator running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on the notion that she is a \u201cprogressive prosecutor,\u201d threading the needle between law-and-order toughness and a protective instinct for those who need it. Harris told ABC News recently that she became a prosecutor \u201cbecause I just have a very strong and natural desire to want to protect people, and in particular our most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nA Harris campaign aide said she was unaware of the Diaz case while it was being litigated by her office, and that it\u2019s rare for an attorney general to be made aware of cases before the state compensation board.\n\nMultiple documents in the case appear on Harris\u2019 letterhead and were signed by staff members with the notation under their names, \u201cFor Kamala D. Harris, Attorney General.\u201d\n\nDistrust Lingers\n\nWhatever her involvement in the Diaz case and other innocence claims, actions by Harris\u2019 offices -- carried out in her name, by people working on her behalf -- have left some voters and advocates distrustful. Criminal justice advocates are critical of her handling of wrongful conviction cases, in particular, saying her offices resisted at least five such claims despite compelling evidence of innocence.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris should have known\u201d about the Diaz case, said Lara Bazelon, an innocence advocate and law professor at the University of San Francisco. \u201cIf she truly was not aware that these specious and risible arguments were being made in her name, that is a failure of management.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Diaz.\n\nHarris\u2019 district attorney\u2019s office repeatedly delayed responding to the innocence claims of Maurice Caldwell by filing for extensions as Harris ran for attorney general in 2010, keeping Caldwell in prison for more than a year despite evidence that someone else had committed the murder for which he was convicted, according to court records. A judge admonished Harris\u2019 office for the delays and said they might warrant sanctions.A state appeals court judge criticized Harris\u2019 office for falsely claiming that the only eyewitness against Jamal Trulove in his murder case feared for her life, making Trulove seem more sinister than he was. The judge said the story was \u201ca yarn\u201d and \u201cmade out of whole cloth.\u201d Trulove was convicted, but later exonerated after six years in prison.The California attorney general\u2019s office under Harris resisted the innocence claim of Daniel Larsen by arguing that he hadn\u2019t filed his petition for release in a timely fashion, and also contested his request for compensation after he was exonerated. Larsen had been sentenced to 27-years-to-life for possession of a knife under California\u2019s \u201cthree-strikes\u201d law.\n\nHarris\u2019 presidential campaign spokesman, Ian Sams, responded to questions about those cases by pointing to reforms Harris enacted.\n\n\u201cKamala has fought to give ex-offenders a second chance ever since she created one of the nation\u2019s first major re-entry programs, \u2018Back on Track,\u2019 in San Francisco, which helped put people in jobs not jails,\u201d Sams said in a written response.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Jose Diaz was exonerated after serving almost nine years in a California prison for two sexual assaults he didn\u2019t commit.
