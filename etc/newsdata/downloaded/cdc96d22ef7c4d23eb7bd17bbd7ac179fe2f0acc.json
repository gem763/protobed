Turkey is very happy. The United States is very happy. And, you know what? Civilization is very happy. It\u2019s a great thing for civilization.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally who had stridently criticized the president's handling of the Turkish intervention, called the deal \"real progress\" and a \"breakthough,\" though he did not pull a proposed sanctions bill co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).\n\nBut Middle East analysts were less impressed. \"This is more than Turkey ever wanted from the U.S.,\" said Hassan Hassan, a Syria expert at the Center for Global Policy. \"At least since 2015, Turkey had tried to get American concessions over specific towns, like Manbij and Raqqa. This is a wholesale concession. Erdogan without a doubt got more than he bargained for: the end of the Kurdish project and the U.S. withdrawal in northern Syria.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), offered a mix of measured praise for Pence and Pompeo. \"But doesn\u2019t appear 'cease-fire' signals change in Erdogan\u2019s goal,\" he said in a tweet. \"He still plans to rid area of Kurds & create 'security zone,' but is giving Kurds an ultimatum: They can leave voluntarily or leave dead.\"\n\nOnly 24 hours earlier, Trump\u2019s gambit to send Pompeo and Pence to Ankara had alarmed some in the administration.\n\nTheir charge was to notch a cease-fire with Erdo\u011fan, the man who started the conflict in northern Syria and showed no desire to end it. In public statements, he rejected the notion of a cease-fire, and there was fear in the administration that Pence would head home and Pompeo go on to Jerusalem empty-handed. And, by that narrow measure, the nine-hour trip to Turkey was successful.\n\nOver the next five days, Turkey will halt its military operations while the YPG \u2014 the Kurdish military group whose muscle was crucial to crushing the Islamic State \u2014 leaves the safe zone. The Kurdish troops are already leaving the Syrian border region, Pence noted. Turkey will not engage militarily in Kobani, a Kurdish-majority Syrian city whose desperate stand against ISIS was where the U.S. alliance with Syria\u2019s Kurds was forged in blood.\n\nBriefing reporters on the State Department's plane as it left Ankara, Jeffrey said the U.S. had assessed that the Kurds \"have no military ability to hold onto these areas and therefore we thought that a ceasefire would be much better ... for trying to get some kind of control over this chaotic situation.\"\n\n\"The Turkish army has seized a great deal of territory in a very short period of time,\" he added. \"We had no doubt that they would continue seizing territory if we couldn\u2019t get a ceasefire. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\" he said.\n\nAccording to a fact sheet passed out to reporters, the U.S. also reaffirmed Turkey\u2019s good standing in NATO, a subject of heated commentary back in Washington, and the two countries committed to preserving Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nThere were some small signs for hope all day. Pence and Erdogan held the first meeting one on one, with envoy Jim Jeffrey \u2014 a longtime Middle East hand \u2014 serving as the translator for the U.S. side. The meeting was scheduled to last for just 10 minutes, aides said, but it stretched to nearly an hour and a half.\n\nAfterwards, reporters were escorted into a conference room where Erdogan and his advisers were meeting Pence, Pompeo and their team. U.S. officials made sure to note that this mere fact \u2014 American reporters entering the inner chambers of the Turkish president \u2014 was monumental in and of itself.\n\nAt around 7:15 p.m. in Ankara, four hours after Pence and Pompeo entered the presidential palace, the Turks started to bring food for hungry aides and reporters.\n\nBut almost immediately, Turkish crews began setting up cameras. And Pence and Pompeo were readying to leave the palace for the ambassador\u2019s residence to announce the framework of the agreement.\n\nPence and Pompeo took a handful of questions from reporters before yielding the spotlight to Trump, who praised their efforts \u2014 and his own \u2014 upon landing in Fort Worth.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the thing I\u2019m most happy about,\u201d he said, was the speed of the agreement. \u201cI took a lot of heat, but that we were able to do it so fast. I thought this would go on for longer. This was such a smart thing to get it done so fast.\u201d\n\nAnd he insisted that the \u201cunconventional\u201d deal wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the dramatic events of recent days.\n\n\u201cTurkey wouldn't have done this three days ago,\u201d he said. The Kurds would not have done it three days ago. This is a situation where everybody is happy. And I\u2019m happy, because there\u2019s no fighting. We can bring certainly most of our people back home for the first time in many years.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5d/05/821e620044d1ba0e82aa5f73b8e8/191017-pence-pompeo-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
