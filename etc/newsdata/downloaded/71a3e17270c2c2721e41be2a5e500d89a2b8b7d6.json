We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!' he assured skeptics.\n\nDonald Trump confirmed Tuesday morning that he'd extended an invitation to Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan to meet with him at the White House in November\n\nTurkey has said it will create a 'peace corridor' along its southern border, now that Trump has agreed to withdraw American troops from Syria.\n\nAnkara's Defence Ministry said 'all preparations' had been completed for the start of an attack against 'terrorists threatening the integrity of our homeland'.\n\nBy 'terrorists' Turkey is almost certainly referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which allied with the US in the fight against ISIS but which it considers to be a terrorist group.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan began rolling troops into northern Syria on Monday after a day of confusion and criticism in which Trump agreed US troops would step aside, before appearing to walk back on his pledge following political backlash.\n\nThe last time Erdogan was in Washington visiting Trump, his security forces beat protesters on U.S. soil. They claimed diplomatic immunity and were not prosecuted\n\nTurkey has said it is ready to open a 'peace corridor' by eradicating terrorists along its southern border, once US troops have withdrawn.

The ministry said on Twitter that 'nine terrorists were neutralised' in air strikes in the Hakurk and Hafta regions. There were earlier strikes, announced late Monday, in the northern Iraqi region of Gara, where 'three terrorists were neutralised'. The strikes were part of regular raids against Kurdish militants in Iraq and unrelated to planned operations against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Turkey started a ground offensive and bombing campaign against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Iraq last May.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to shore up his tough-guy credentials, Trump tweeted Monday that if Turkey 'does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey'.\n\nMr Trump left the United Nations and European leaders aghast yesterday amid fears it could lead to widespread ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe President defended his withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, saying 'the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out'.\n\nThe UN was said to be 'preparing for the worst' and has warned Turkey not to allow a civilian massacre on the scale of the Bosnian war after the US announced it would step aside and allow President Tayyip Erogdan to move in across the Syrian border.\n\nBNL Breaking News tweeted: 'Reports of Turkish airstrikes on the Kurdish-controlled Semelka border crossing between Syria and Iraq, comes just hours after US withdraws troops from Syria and 'allowed Turkish invasion'.'\n\nAnd Russian state media outlet Sputnik tweeted that Turkish Air Forces struck a Kurdish base in Hasakah, Syria. But it also reports that Kurdish and Turkish media were denying the strikes.\n\nAnadolu News Agency reported that Turkey had established a 'safe zone' after it said the military was 'ready to clear out terrorists east of Euphrates River in Syria'.\n\nUS military vehicles travelling down a main road in northeast Syria today.

Trump said he would 'totally destroy and obliterate' Turkey's economy if it took action in Syria that he considered 'off-limits'. Trump's stern words seemed to be aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces. Leaders from both parties and both houses of Congress joined in the criticism, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump's fellow Republican. 'As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)' Trump tweeted. Speaking later at the White House, Trump said he had told President Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call that Turkey could suffer the 'wrath of an extremely decimated economy' if it acted in Syria in a way that was not 'humane.' Turkey's lira slid more than 2% to its lowest level in more than a month against the dollar on Monday over concerns about the planned incursion into northern Syria and Trump's warning. Turkey has repeatedly threatened to carry out an incursion against U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria who have links to Kurdish guerrillas operating next door in Turkey. The United States began pulling troops back from the northeast Syrian border on Monday, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area.\n\nFears of chaos in refugee camps and Kurdish-controlled prisons packed with battle-hardened jihadists were sparked as President Trump's surprise decision to allow Turkey to take control in northern Syria threatened to destabilise the area.\n\nAny 'security vacuum' left by the US could lead to ISIS plotting mass prison breaks and instigating the reformation of terror cells.\n\nThe EU and the UN warned of a repeat of ethnic cleansing last seen during the Bosnian civil war at Srebrenica, when Bosnian Serb troops slaughtered 8,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995.\n\nRussia said Syria's territorial integrity must be preserved, hours after the US announcement, as Trump faced calls to reverse his decision even from members of his own party.\n\nUN officials said they were 'preparing for the worst', over fears any new offensive from Ankara would lead to high civilian casualties and lead to mass displacement\n\nTrump responded to fears of Turkish military action targeting civilians by saying he will 'totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey' if it stepped out of line.\n\nHe tweeted this afternoon: 'As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!).\n\n'They must, with Europe and others, watch over the captured ISIS fighters and families.\n\n'The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!'\n\nThe president's threats caused Turkey's currency to slide to its lowest level in more than a month.\n\nThe move marks a major shift in US policy, and effectively abandons the Kurds, who were Washington's main ally in the years-old battle against ISIS.\n\nBut US Senator Lindsey Graham, a top ally of Donald Trump, said he would be calling on Congress to reverse the president's decision.\n\nUS forces were seen as they began to withdraw from northern Syria, making way for Turkey to move across the border\n\nThe area inhabited by Kurdish people straddles Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia and the area currently controlled by the Kurds crosses over Iraq and Syria.

They have been fighting Turkey for decades. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.'\n\nTrump said it's now time to bring US troops home, adding in all-caps in a series of tweets: 'WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.'\n\nThe president also said it's now up to the region to decide what to do with captured ISIS fighters, adding: 'We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!'\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter to threaten Turkey and demand Europe must 'watch over' captured ISIS fighters\n\nUS and Turkish military forces conduct a joint ground patrol inside the security mechanism area in northeast Syria last Friday\n\nA US soldier sits on top of an armoured vehicle during a demonstration by Syrian Kurds against Turkish threats next to a base for the US-led international coalition on the outskirts of Ras al-Ain town near the Turkish border yesterday\n\nSyrian Kurds gather around a US armoured vehicle during a demonstration against Turkish threats next to a base for the US-led international coalition on the outskirts of Ras al-Ain town yesterday\n\nTrump made his case for backing out of Syria in a series of tweets that appeared to please no one on Monday morning\n\nA senior State Department official later contradicted the president and said the US had pulled back a 'very small number' of troops from areas of northern Syria along the Turkish border and that it was still controlling the air space over the area.\n\nThe official added that those troops had only been moved a 'very short distance,' adding: 'Beyond that, there's no change to our military posture in the northeast.'\n\nGraham, chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee and one of Trump's most outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill, described the move as 'a disaster in the making' that would be 'a stain on America's honour for abandoning the Kurds'.\n\nHe added in a tweet: 'Also, if this plan goes forward will introduce Senate resolution opposing and asking for reversal of this decision. Expect it will receive strong bipartisan support.'\n\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney called the withdrawal 'a betrayal' that facilitates a jihadist resurgence.\n\nTrump's former UN envoy Nikki Haley, a Republican seen by some as a potential post-Trump presidential candidate also criticised the withdrawal.\n\nHaley said, calling the Kurds 'instrumental' in the US fight against ISIS: 'We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.'\n\nIt was feared the departure of the US from the volatile border region could leave Turkey free to crush the Kurds, who hoped to forge their own state in the aftermath of the defeat of ISIS.\n\nIran's foreign minister says the United States is an 'irrelevant occupier' in Syria and that the conflict-torn country's territorial integrity should be respected.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif wrote in a tweet today: 'US is an irrelevant occupier in Syria-futile to seek its permission or rely on it for security.'\n\nHe added that Syria's eight-year civil war could only be ended through 'respect for its territorial integrity & its people'.\n\nZarif said 'Adana provides framework for Turkey & Syria,' referring to Iran- and Russia-backed talks.\n\nEU and the UN warned of repeat of ethnic cleansing last seen during the Bosnian civil war at Srebrenica that saw 8,000 Muslim men and boys slaughtered\n\nFrance today called on Turkey to avoid taking any unilateral action in northern Syria that could 'hurt regional stability' of northeastern region\n\nAssad ally Russia, has warned that Syria's territorial integrity must be preserved\n\nKurdish fighters who have led the fight against ISIS and were Washington's main allies said they had been 'stabbed in the back' by Trump's sudden decision\n\nTrump ally US Senator Lindsey Graham said he would be calling on Congress to reverse the president's move to withdraw\n\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney called the withdrawal 'a betrayal' that facilitates a jihadist resurgence\n\nThe Pentagon warned Turkey against the 'destabilising consequences' of military action in Syria.\n\nA senior State Department official said the United States does not support the planned Turkish incursion into northeast Syria 'in any shape or form'.\n\n'It is a very bad idea,' the official said while briefing reporters and added that Ankara's plan to resettle millions of Syrian refugees back into northeast Syria was 'probably the craziest idea I have ever heard'.\n\nPentagon Spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said: 'We will work with our other NATO allies and Coalition partners to reiterate to Turkey the possible destabilising consequences of potential actions to Turkey, the region, and beyond.'\n\nA senior UN aid official said today that civilians must be spared in any Turkish military operation in northeast Syria, where the United Nations hopes mass displacement and Srebrenica-like killings can be prevented.\n\nUS soldiers previously worked closely with Kurdish forces of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the YPG militia, in the battle to destroy Islamic State's caliphate.\n\nBut Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist group and has long threatened to launch an assault on the Kurds as Ankara sees the group's growing power along its border as a threat to its security.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters, who are allied with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, has waged an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years.\n\nThe US has already warned Kurdish fighters that they will not defend them from any Turkish attack, an unnamed American official has claimed.\n\nWithin hours of the announcement, Turkish media reported a bomb attack in a northern Syrian town held by Turkey-backed fighters killed at least one person.\n\nCNN-Turk television said at least two other people were wounded when a motorcycle laden with explosives went off in the town of Azaz today.\n\nAzaz, which was once controlled by Syrian Kurdish fighters opposed to Turkey, has been hit by similar attacks in the past.\n\nA military base (above) from which US forces pulled out in the town of Tel Arqam yesterday\n\nA members of the Kurdish Internal Security Police Force of Asayesh standing guard as Syrian Kurds demonstrate against possible Turkish military operation in the region\n\nPresident Erdogan during a news conference in Ankara today before his departure for Serbia, where he said US troops have started to withdraw from positions in northern Syria\n\nSyrian Kurdish women carry flags and banners as they demonstrate against Turkish threats to launch a military operation on their region in the town of Al-Qahtaniyah, in northeastern Syria\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they had been 'stabbed in the back' by a surprise US statement that US forces would not be involved in a Turkish operation in northern Syria, the SDF said.\n\nTurkey said it will not permit ISIS to return, amid fears its threatened offensive against a Kurdish militia in Syria could bolster the jihadists, a presidential spokesman said today.\n\nFahrettin Altun, communications director for President Erdogan, said on Twitter today that, 'Turkey's intension is clear: to dismantle the terrorist corridor on our border. To fight against [the] PKK, which is the enemy of the Kurdish people. To combat [IS] and prevent its resurgence.\n\n'Areas liberated from PKK will have services provided by Turkey, rather than enduring the occupation by a terrorist militia.'\n\nSpeaking after a phone call with President Trump, Erdogan said that the operation could begin at any moment as Russia warned Syria's territorial integrity must be preserved.\n\nHow Turkey's expected invasion of Syria would threaten the Kurds who defeated ISIS What is Turkey's problem with the Kurds? Turkey has historically treated the Kurds unsympathetically and has effectively made them 'mountain Turks' by driving them into the hilly areas around the south of the country. The founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal, better known as Atat\u00fcrk, pushed through a constitution 70 years ago which denied the existence of distinct cultural sub-groups in Turkey, which the Kurds fall under. Due to this, when the Kurds - along with other minorities in the country - express ethnic differences it has been repressed by the government. Up until 1991 the daily use of the Kurdish tongue was outlawed and seen as separatism, and even today any minor expression of Kurdish nationalism can lead to imprisonment. The government thwarts any effort by the Kurds to become political, with parties consistently shut down and party members often imprisoned for 'crimes of opinion'. The historical repression led to the creation of the PKK, an armed separatist movement, in 1984. Most Kurds in Turkey do not promote separatism from the Turkish state, but a large number back the PKK. Who are the Kurds? There are around 35million Kurds living in the hilly parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia - making them the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East. Yet they do not have a permanent state. They do not have an official dialect but are part of a united community through race, culture and language. The Kurdish people are made up of a number of religions but they are mostly Sunni Muslims. The idea of a 'Kurdistan' came about in the 1900s following the fall of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The Treaty of Sevres among the Western nations in 1920 also made provision for one. But just three years later the Treaty of Lausanne overwrote this as it set the new boundaries for Turkey. There was no space for a Kurdistan and left them stranded as a minority community in other countries. Attempts over the rest of the 20th Century to bring about an independent state were dashed at every turn. What do they want? The Kurdish people make up around 10 per cent of the Syrian population and most lived in Damascus and Aleppo before uprisings started against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Despite this, they have never had basic rights and at least 300,000 have had citizenship requests denied since the 1960s. Land has also been consistently taken from them and given to Arabs in a bit to 'Arabize' the area. In 2011 when uprisings got underway, most Kurds did not publicly back a side, but from halfway through 2012 they seized the opportunity when government forces withdrew to fight rebels elsewhere. The main Kurdish parties, notably the Democratic Union Party in January 2014 announced the creation of 'autonomy' for the areas of Afrin, Kobane and Jazira. This escalated to a 'federal system' in March 2016 in Turmen and Arab areas snatched from ISIS. This, unsurprisingly, was turned down by Assad, as well as the country's official opposition and the Americans. The Democratic Union Party claims it is not looking for independence, but says there must be Kurdish legal rights and autonomy in any political end to the Syrian war. In government there has been a disparity, with Assad pledging to fight back for all of Syria, but his foreign minister hinting at possible talks with the Kurds in September 2017. What does Turkey want? Turkey wants a 'safe zone' in northern Syria - 30 kilometres deep and 300 miles wide - that would push the YPG away from its border. It says the buffer zone would also allow for the return of some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey, where anti-refugee sentiment is growing. The YPG spearheaded the fight on the ground against the Islamic State (IS) group as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, with the support of the US-led international coalition. But Ankara says the YPG is a 'terrorist' offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. A victory for Erdogan? Since Erdogan has long pushed for the 'safe zone', the US move is 'absolutely' a victory for him, said Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'Erdogan has been working tirelessly to convince (US President Donald) Trump that the US should leave Syria so that Turkey can prosecute the fight against the YPG and resettle Syrians,' he said. The White House decision came after a phone call between Trump and Erdogan, demonstrating the Turkish leader's ability to convince his American counterpart despite resistance within the US administration. 'By giving the green light to Turkey to intervene, the United States has given the impression of having 'capitulated' with Turkish demands,' said Jana Jabbour, a Turkish foreign policy expert at Sciences Po in Paris. 'This in itself is a diplomatic victory for Erdogan,' she said. Challenges ahead? Turkey has launched two military operations supporting Syrian opposition fighters - in northern Syria against IS in 2016 and against the YPG in 2018. But a question remains over Turkey's ability in the air. During the offensive against the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in early 2018, Ankara needed Russia's permission for Turkish planes to take off. The latest plan is much bigger in scope - and more expensive. 'A new Syria operation will generate economic costs, and it is not certain that in the context of the current recession in Turkey the country has the means for such an operation,' Jabbour said. She also pointed to growing scepticism among the Turkish public towards Ankara's involvement in the 'Syrian chaos'. 'This is why Ankara would have preferred an agreement with the United States for the establishment of the safe zone on the border, a scenario which would have allowed Turkey to share the burden with Washington,' Jabbour said. How to manage IS? Turkey has another burden, as the White House said Ankara would now be responsible for IS fighters captured over the past two years and held in Kurdish detention centres. Trump, who has frequently urged European governments to repatriate jihadists from their countries, has now pushed the problem onto Turkey. Erdogan said Monday that Washington and Ankara would work on the issue together but he did not elaborate on the form of the eventual cooperation. 'Now Turkey has to confront IS, which shows every indication of trying to regroup and threaten the countries in the area,' Cook said. However, Erdogan's spokesman insisted in a tweet on Monday that Turkey 'will not allow (IS) to return in any shape and form'.\n\nThe pull-back of troops comes hours after the White House announced Ankara would soon move forward with its objective to create a 'safe zone' in northern Syria and that US soldiers will not support or be involved in it.\n\nBut there are fears a Turkish advance will reverse years of work done to drive extremists out and allow ISIS to regroup.\n\nThe US-backed SDF that controls much of the northeast region along Turkey's border, added it 'will not hesitate for a single moment' to defend itself from an expected Turkish invasion and threatened 'all-out war on the entire border'.\n\nFrance called on Turkey to avoid taking any unilateral action in northern Syria that could hinder the ongoing fight against ISIS.\n\nThe statement from the Foreign Ministry Monday warned Turkey's threatened military incursion into northern Syria could 'hurt regional stability' and not help with the return of refugees to the area - as Ankara has promised.\n\nMore French fighters joined the extremist group than any other European nationality. France has been reluctant to allow the militants home, even to face trial.\n\nThe White House released a statement Sunday, saying President Trump spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erogdan by telephone to discuss the plans for Turkey to invade northern Syria (both leaders pictured in June 2019)\n\nMap shows Euphrates Shield, which was a cross-border operation by the Turkish military and Turkey-aligned Syrian opposition groups during the Syrian Civil War.

Known as Euphrates Shield, Turkish artillery pound dozens of ISIS targets around the Syrian border town of Jarabulus, near the Euphrates river in the early hours of August 24, 2016. Turkish F-16 fighter jets and coalition war planes launch air strikes. It is the start of operation Euphrates Shield, targeting IS and the People's Protection Units (YPG), a US-backed Kurdish militia that Ankara considers a terrorist group. In a few hours, hundreds of Syrian rebels backed by Turkish aircraft and tanks drive IS from Jarabulus. The offensive is launched days after an attack blamed on IS that killed 54 civilians in the Turkish town of Gaziantep. Turkey also wants to prevent the creation of an autonomous Kurdish region in Syria. It had been alarmed when the YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) had earlier in August captured from IS the strategic Syrian town of Manbij, 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the Turkish border. Turkey says the YPG is a 'terrorist offshoot' of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. On February 24, 2017, the Turkish army announces it has taken control of the Syrian town of Al-Bab, the final objective of Euphrates Shield and the last IS bastion in Syria's northern Aleppo province. For Ankara, control of the town means it can establish a buffer between the different Kurdish-controlled territories in northern Syria, preventing them from uniting. On January 20, 2018, Turkey launches a major air and ground operation, dubbed Olive Branch, against the YPG in Syria's region of Afrin, about 30 kilometres from the border. The next day, Turkish tanks and soldiers enter the region. Ankara says it aims to create a security zone deep inside Syria. On March 18, Turkish forces and their Syrian auxiliaries oust the Kurdish militia from the town of Afrin and raise the Turkish flag. Scenes of looting by pro-Turkish fighters draw condemnation. Pro-Turkish forces strengthen their control of Afrin, which is emptied of its tens of thousands of inhabitants. The fighting displaces about half of the Kurdish enclave's 320,000 people, according to the United Nations, while rights groups document abuses after the Turkish-backed rebel takeover. Amnesty International has charged that the Turkish armed forces have 'turned a blind eye' to violations. Nearly 300 civilians were killed in the operation, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor. Also dead are around 1,500 Kurdish militiamen and 400 pro-Turkish fighters, it says. Turkey says it lost 45 soldiers.\n\nBut she cautioned that successes against ISIS, which she noted were achieved in significant part by Syrian Kurdish forces with international support, 'must not be endangered'.\n\nDemmer said that a unilateral military intervention 'would lead to a further escalation in Syria and contribute to a continued destabilisation of the country.' She said it would also have negative security policy and humanitarian consequences.\n\nA US official said American forces had evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn in northeast Syria, along the Turkish border.

Motivated largely by the aim of containing Syrian Kurdish power, Turkey already has troops on the ground across an arc of northwestern Syria, the last stronghold of anti-Damascus rebels.\n\nUS military vehicles were seen driving northwards in northern Syria today, ahead of an anticipated Turkish invasion of the region that the Kurds say will overturn five years of achievements in the battle against ISIS\n\nA US official said American forces had already evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn in northeast Syria, along the Turkish border\n\nThe US informed the commander of the Kurdish-led SDF forces in Syria on Monday morning that US forces will not defend them from Turkish attacks anywhere, according to a source.\n\n'Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operating into Northern Syria,' the US statement reads.\n\n'The Unites States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial ''Caliphate,'' will no longer be in the immediate area.'\n\nThe White House also confirmed that Turkey plans to take into custody all ISIS fighters captured over the past two years that European powers have refused to take in.\n\n'The United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused.'\n\n'The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area capture over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial ''Caliphate'' by the United States.'\n\nAnkara said its planned 'safe zone' in northern Syria could allow up to two million Syrian refugees to return.\n\nThe safe zone 'will serve two purposes: secure Turkey's borders by eliminating terrorist elements and allow refugees to return to their homes,' Kalin said.\n\nHe said Turkey had 'no interest in occupation or changing demographics'.\n\nThere are over 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, the highest number in the world, which has become an increasing source of tension in the country.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation that reports on the war, said US forces had withdrawn from an area between the towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe SDF, led by the Kurdish YPG militia, said the Turkish invasion 'will have a great negative impact' on the war against ISIS.\n\nTurkish forces artillery pieces being driven to their new positions near the border with Syria in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, yesterday\n\nUS-backed Kurdish-led forces in Syria said US troops began withdrawing today from their positions along Turkey's border in northeastern Syria, ahead of an anticipated Turkish invasion.

their native countries have been reluctant to take them back - and about 10,000 captured fighters from Syria and Iraq.\n\nKurdish officials have expressed concerns of a possible breakout by ISIS prisoners in case of fighting in the area.\n\nSyrian Kurds gather around a US armoured vehicle during a demonstration against Turkish threats next to a US-led international coalition base on the outskirts of Ras al-Ain town in Syria's Hasakeh province near the Turkish yesterday\n\nUS and Turkish military forces conducting the third ground combined joint patrol inside the security mechanism area in northeast Syria last week\n\nThe Turkish and US troops start their second joint ground patrol within a planned safe zone in northern Syria along the Syrian-Turkish border, in Sanliurfa, Turkey, last month\n\nUS and Turkish military forces conduct a joint ground patrol inside the security mechanism area in northeast Syria last month\n\nAsked about the White House comments, Erdogan said that both Turkey and the US were working separately to see 'what steps can be taken' so that foreign fighters in prison can be repatriated.\n\n'This is being worked on,' he said today.\n\nA senior UN envoy for Syria said the fighting sides should 'put people first' amid concerns an invasion by Turkish forces into a densely populated area could be triggered.\n\nPanos Moumtzis, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Syria, speaking in Geneva today, stressed there were 'a lot of unanswered questions' about the consequences of the operation.\n\nHe added civilians must be spared in any Turkish military manoeuvres and added that the UN had seen a 'bitter history' of safe zones in places like Srebrenica.\n\nMoumtzis was referring to the slaughter by Bosnian Serb troops of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995 in a UN-declared 'safe zone' where Dutch peacekeepers were unable to protect civilians.\n\nHe said: 'We don't know what is going to happen...we are preparing for the worst.\n\n'We understand that there is going to be some kind of security zone which will be very specifically targeted to a military operation or to an area where there has to be some clearance.\n\n'So our hope is that there will be full cooperation by all to make sure that it happens as smoothly as possible, without resulting in displacement, and ensuring protection of civilians, ensuring that the basic principles of humanity will be respected on the ground.'\n\nHe said the UN's priorities were to ensure that any prospective Turkish offensive not result in new displacements, that humanitarian access remain unhindered and that no restrictions be put in place on freedom of movement.\n\nThe UN has a contingency plan to address additional civilian suffering, but 'hopes that will not be used,' Moumtzis said.\n\nMore than 1,000 US troops are currently deployed in northeastern Syria but will no longer be present during the invasions.\n\nThe US soldiers work closely with the Kurdish YPG, which leads the Syrian Democratic Forces in the regions.\n\nTurkey is highly likely to wait until US soldiers have withdrawn from northern Syria before launching an offensive, a senior Turkish official said today.\n\nHe added that the withdrawal of US forces from the planned area of operations could take one week and that Ankara was highly likely to wait for this in order to avoid 'any accident'.\n\n'The Unites States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation,' the statement reads\n\nFighters from a new border security force under the command of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dance during a graduation ceremony in Hasaka, northeastern Syria, last January\n\nOn Monday, the US-backed SDF said such an operation would reverse years of successful Kurdish-led operations to defeat the Islamic State group and allow some of its surviving leaders to come out of hiding.\n\nIt also warned that a Turkish invasion would pose a threat to SDF-run prisons and informal settlements housing thousands of IS jihadists and their families.\n\nAnkara wants to push the US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces from its border, saying that the group is a 'terrorist' offshoot of Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.\n\nThe Turkish military has twice launched offensives in Syria - against IS in 2016, and in 2018 against the People's Protection Units (YPG), the backbone of the SDF.\n\nLong marginalised, Syria's Kurds have - beyond heavy campaigns against IS - essentially stayed out of the country's eight-year civil war, instead setting up their own institutions in areas under their control.\n\nTimeline of US involvement in Syria since 2011 Pressure on Assad On April 29, 2011, a month after the first protests in Syria that were met with brutal force by the regime, Washington imposes sanctions on several Syrian officials. The measures extend to President Bashar al-Assad the following month. On August 18, US president Barack Obama and Western allies for the first time explicitly call on Assad to stand down. In October, the US ambassador leaves Syria for 'security reasons'. Damascus recalls its ambassador from Washington. Obama backs off 'red line' In August 2013, the Syrian regime is accused of carrying out a chemical attack near Damascus that killed more than 1,400 people, according to Washington. Despite having vowed to act with force if Syria crossed the chemical weapons 'red line', Obama at the last minute pulls back from punitive strikes on regime infrastructure. Instead, on September 14, he agrees to a deal with Moscow - Assad's main backer - that is meant to dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. US targets IS On September 23, 2014, the US and Arab allies launch air strikes in Syria against the Islamic State (IS) group, expanding a campaign underway in neighbouring Iraq. The biggest contributor to the coalition, Washington deploys 2,000 soldiers, mostly special forces. In October 2015, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-Syrian Arab alliance of some 50,000 fighters, is created with US backing. Dominated by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, it receives US training and aid in the form of arms, air support and intelligence. The SDF later overruns IS in northeastern Syria, driving out the jihadists from their last patch of territory in the village of Baghouz in March 2019. Trump orders strikes On April 7, 2017, US forces fire a barrage of cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase, believed to be the launch site of a chemical attack that killed 88 people in Idlib province. It is the first direct US action against Assad's government and President Donald Trump's most significant military decision since taking office in January 2017. On April 14, 2018, the US - with the support of France and Britain - launches new retaliatory strikes after an alleged regime chemical attack on the then rebel-held town of Douma, in which some 40 people were killed. Withdrawal announced On December 19, 2018, Trump announces that all of the roughly 2,000 US troops in Syria will be withdrawn because IS had been 'defeated'. The surprise decision prompts Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign and is met with concern by France, Britain and Germany, but praise from Russia and Turkey. On January 16, 2019, a suicide attack claimed by IS kills four US servicemen and 15 others at a restaurant in Syria's northern city of Manbij. It is the deadliest attack against US forces since they deployed. On August 7, Turkish and US officials agree to jointly manage a buffer zone between the Turkish border and areas in Syria controlled by the YPG, which Istanbul considers a 'terrorist' threat. US steps aside But on October 6, Washington announces that US forces would withdraw from the border areas to make way for a 'long-planned operation' by Turkish forces. The following day, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirms that Turkish action against Kurdish militants in Syria is imminent. The United Nations says it is 'preparing for the worst' and the European Union warns that civilians could be harmed.\n\nIn the areas of Ras al-Ayn, Tal Abyad and Kobane, all bordering Turkey, Kurdish forces have dug trenches and tunnels in preparation for a Turkish offensive, the Observatory said Sunday.\n\nThe US announcement will likely be seen as a long-feared abandonment of Kurdish allies who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against the Islamic State militants.\n\nBali also tweeted that his group is not expecting the US to protect northeastern Syria, adding: 'But people here are owed an explanation regarding the security mechanism deal and destruction of fortifications.'\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said on Monday that 'renewed armed hostilities in the northeast will not only exacerbate civilian suffering and lead to massive displacement but will also risk severely undermining current political efforts'.\n\nKocijancic says the EU remains committed to Syria' 'unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity' and that a long-term solution to the conflict 'will not be reached through military means but requires a genuine political transition.'\n\nThe official Twitter account of the Syrian Democratic Forces said Sunday night that it had fulfilled its commitment to the US proposal for the 'security mechanism' along the border and says that any Turkish attack will 'reverse the successful effort to defeat #ISIS\n\nIn an agreement between Ankara and Washington, joint US and Turkish aerial and ground patrols had started in a security zone that covers over 78 miles (125 kilometers) along the Turkey-Syria border between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe SDF had removed fortification from the areas, considered a threat by Turkey, and withdrawn with heavy weapons.\n\nBut Turkey and the US have disagreed over the depth of the zone, with Ankara seeking to also have its troops monitor a stretch of territory between 19 to 25 miles (30 and 40 kilometers deep). Erdogan has continued to threaten an attack.\n\nThe United Nations currently delivers aid to 700,000 people in the densely-populated northeast region of 1.7 million.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ankara before departing for a visit to Serbia, Erdogan also said he planned to visit Washington to meet with Trump in the first half of November.\n\nHe said the two leaders would discuss plans for the 'safe zone', and added that he hoped to resolve a dispute over F-35 fighter jets during his visit.\n\nThe official Twitter account of the Syrian Democratic Forces said on Sunday night that it had fulfilled its commitment to the US proposal for the 'security mechanism' along the border and says that any Turkish attack will 'reverse the successful effort to defeat #ISIS.\n\n'But Erdogan's threats are aimed to change the security mechanism into a mechanism of death, displace our people & change the stable & secure region into a zone of conflict and permanent war,' the SDF tweeted, warning that a Turkish military invasion would make Syria 'a permanent conflict area'.\n\nMuslim convert Jack Letts, from Oxfordshire, has been pictured gaunt and lying on the floor in an overcrowded jail in northern Syria\n\nFor months, Turkish Erdogan has threatened to launch the military assault against Kurdish forces across the border he views as a threat to his country.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have warned that allowing the Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds, sending a troubling message to American allies across the globe.\n\nOne of the ISIS soldiers expected to be moved to Turkish custody is British Jihadi Jack Letts, who was pictured just days ago.\n\nDubbed 'Jihadi Jack', he was filmed among dozens of fellow Islamic State (IS) prisoners, also in orange jumpsuits, who have been captured by Kurdish militia.\n\nThe 23-year-old Muslim convert from Oxfordshire, who declared himself an 'enemy of Britain' and fled to the Middle East to join IS, has been stripped of his UK citizenship.\n\nHis mother Sally Lane pleaded for Letts to be allowed to return and face trial in this country so that he can be rescued from the conditions in which he is being held, but the Home Office dismissed her plea.\n\nSeeing the first images of Letts in his cell since he was taken prisoner two years ago, she told The Mail on Sunday: 'It's heart-rending to see your son like this and to feel so completely powerless.\n\n'We have been pressing the Red Cross for months to tell us what the jail is really like, but they always refuse, saying that to release this information would jeopardise their access.'", "description": "Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday morning that he'd extended an invitation to Turkish strongman\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan to meet with him at the White House in November.", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19444026-0-image-a-7_1570541303358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
