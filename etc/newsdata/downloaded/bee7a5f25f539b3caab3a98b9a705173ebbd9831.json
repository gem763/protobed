Sulzberger: Trump part of 'worldwide assault' on journalism", "language": "en", "text": "New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger penned a new op-ed accusing President Trump of being a key figure in the \u201cworldwide assault\u201d on journalism.\n\n\u201cJournalism is a human enterprise, and we sometimes make mistakes. But we also try to own our mistakes, to correct them and to rededicate ourselves every day to the highest standards of journalism,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger wrote in a piece published in the paper Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBut when the president decries \u2018fake news,\u2019 he\u2019s not interested in actual mistakes,\u201d he argued. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to delegitimize real news, dismissing factual and fair reporting as politically motivated fabrications. So when The Times reveals his family\u2019s fraudulent financial practices, when The Wall Street Journal reveals hush money paid to a porn star, when The Washington Post reveals his personal foundation\u2019s self-dealing, he can sidestep accountability by simply dismissing the reports as \u2018fake news.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Sulzberger wrote that while Mr. Trump has been working to undermine his own citizens\u2019 faith in the press, his \u201cfake news\u201d rhetoric has spread across the world, giving autocratic foreign leaders permission to silence speech.\n\n\u201cIn the past few years, more than 50 prime ministers, presidents and other government leaders across five continents have used the term \u2018fake news\u2019 to justify varying levels of anti-press activity,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI have raised these concerns with President Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve told him that these efforts to attack and suppress independent journalism is what the United States is now inspiring abroad. Though he listened politely and expressed concern, he has continued to escalate his anti-press rhetoric, which has reached new heights as he campaigns for re-election.\u201d\n\nMr. Sulzberger listed several ways that journalism advocates can combat Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, including holding \u201cfairness,\u201d \u201caccuracy\u201d and \u201cindependence\u201d above all else.\n\n\u201cOur loyalty must be to facts, not to any party or any leader, and we must continue to follow the truth wherever it leads, without fear or favor,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe true power of a free press is an informed, engaged citizenry,\u201d he continued. \u201cI believe in independent journalism and want it to thrive. I believe in this country and its values, and I want us to live up to them and offer them as a model for a freer and more just world.\n\n\u201cThe United States has done more than any other country to popularize the idea of free expression and to champion the rights of the free press,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThe time has come for us to fight for those ideals again.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
