Tai Tuivasa at UFC 243: Best photos view 20 images\n\nIf Tai Tuivasa hits you with his heavy hands, your night can end in a flash. The problem for the affable Australian heavyweight is that when he doesn\u2019t land the bullseye, he tends to run into trouble.\n\nThat was the case Saturday night at UFC 243 as Moldova\u2019s Serghei Spivac had a big night at his expense.\n\nSpivac (10-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC) outwrestled Tuivasa (10-3 MMA, 3-3 UFC) for the better half of a round-and-a-half before finishing him with a ruthlessly efficient arm-triangle choke. Tuivasa went out rather than tap, which put this in the books as a technical submission at the 3:14 mark of the second round at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nTuivasa tested Spivac early with a smattering of solid shots. But Spivac, who had lost his UFC debut via TKO to Walt Harris in 50 seconds in May, showed he had a chin and also a Plan B.\n\nSpivac outwrestled Tuivasa over the bulk of the round, and while he didn\u2019t come close to a finish during the opening stanza, it was clear he was down the right path.\n\nThings turned really one-sided in the second. This time, Spivac got Tuivasa to the mat, improved his position, rendered Tuivasa a bloody mess with his ground-and-pound, and got things done with the choke.\n\nAll 10 of Spivac\u2019s career victories have come by way of finish. Tuivasa, who won his first three bouts in the UFC, has now lost three straight.\n\nThe heavyweight bout was part of the UFC 243 main card. It aired on pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN2 and UFC Fight Pass/ESPN+.\n\nUp-to-the-minute UFC 243 results include:", "description": "Serghei Spivac took things to the ground against slugger Tai Tuivasa, who had no answer.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Ken Hathaway", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/serghei-spivac-tai-tuivasa-ufc-243-11.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
