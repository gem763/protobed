(AP) - Prosecutors have dropped a felony sexual-assault case against a Michigan State University athletic trainer who separately was among several people at the school implicated in the Larry Nassar sex-abuse scandal.\n\nDavid Jager was charged with assault with intent to commit sexual penetration in a 2016 incident involving a woman in Lansing. The Ingham County Prosecutor\u2019s Office told a judge Friday that it was dismissing the charge.\n\nThe case wasn\u2019t related to Nassar.\n\nBut the state attorney general\u2019s office last year concluded that Jager and 10 others at Michigan State knew about but didn\u2019t report Nassar\u2019s sexual abuse of gymnasts and other female athletes. Nassar was convicted and sentenced to decades in prison.\n\nJager has been on unpaid leave since late August.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Prosecutors have dropped a felony sexual-assault case against a Michigan State University athletic trainer who separately was among several people at the school implicated in the Larry Nassar sex-abuse scandal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
