Narcotizing and beautiful melodies bloom for him in the studio as plentifully as fungi on a rotting stump. But he has said offensive and ignorant things about race and rap, and his portentous formula hasn\u2019t served up depth or variety. His third album, Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding, feels like the moment when it\u2019ll be determined whether he\u2019ll be remembered as an interim or as an emperor. But he doesn\u2019t seem very worried about the culture burning out on him. He\u2019s provided much more of the same.\n\nWhat he is worried about is his health. Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding styles itself as the desperate diary of a bootstrapper who\u2019s being drained by groupies and haters and drugs. He\u2019s talked about this many times before\u2014track No. 3 on 2018\u2019s Beerbongs & Bentleys is titled \u201cRich & Sad\u201d\u2014but unlike his predecessor Drake, he doesn\u2019t have a knack for saying old things in new ways. So instead, he communicates his rising dread by treating rock-and-roll trappings like haunted-house decorations. Detuned guitars warble from the corners of songs; the visuals go medieval; the dark lord Ozzy Osbourne yowls one chorus. Happier cuts resemble Tame Impala (the refreshing \u201cCircles\u201d) or Imagine Dragons (the awful \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be\u201d). In precious passages of mild drama, Malone pushes his voice to a ragged, melodic moan of the sort that was common from \u201990s bands impersonating Nirvana.\n\nTo call the gloom \u201cdepressing\u201d wouldn\u2019t be right, though. His bad never feels that bad; his good never feels that good; his brags and complaints are voiced with the same crassness and lack of specificity. With muffled bounce and bleary horns, \u201cSaint-Tropez\u201d conjures a vacation experienced through dirty taxi windows. One charming couplet: \u201cVersace boxers on my dick / Bud Light runnin\u2019 through my piss.\u201d The mention of a piss-water brand at all demonstrates Malone\u2019s bro appeal, as does him referring to the star of Fight Club as \u201cBradley Pitt.\u201d A newspaper columnist might see his identity shtick\u2014grimy, male, white, angsty without being oppressed\u2014as working-class authenticity. At least that impression is exactly what the social-media managers at Bud Light, a sponsor of Malone\u2019s, are banking on.\n\nHelping to distinguish one song from another are Malone\u2019s guest musicians, many of whom embody the burned-out, genre-agnostic, arrogant-and-pained cultural mood Malone is profiting from\u2014but with more personality. Arguably his best single, \u201cSunflower\u201d uses the national resource that is Swae Lee\u2019s voice to levitate the listener a few feet off the ground. Over the prickling stringlike sounds of \u201cEnemies,\u201d the irrepressible newcomer DaBaby raps in such a way that reminds the listener what it means to be present. On \u201cDie for Me,\u201d Future gasps like he\u2019s stubbed his toe, and Halsey makes a sad-brag better than any of Malone\u2019s: \u201cI sold 15 million copies of a breakup note.\u201d", "description": "The ubiquitous singer/rapper\u2019s third album, Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding, goes darker but not deeper.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2M86G/facebook.jpg?1568039993", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
