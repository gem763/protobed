Come what may in the months ahead, we maintain our commitment to our readers to retain balance and present many different points of view. But on this subject we believe a referendum on the final deal is right.\n\nWe believe there are three reasons:\n\n1. The people, on both sides of the debate, are losing faith with the current process. From Theresa May to Parliament as a whole, a chaotic approach has delivered infighting, resignations and party politics, but little progress on the key issues that people care about.\n\n2. The people on both sides should have the chance to finish what they started. With reality coming into focus, it\u2019s only natural to check this future is what people really want. After years of negotiations behind closed doors, the people must not be shut out of the final decision.\n\n3. The people \u2013 on both sides \u2013 know so much more now than we did in 2016. The campaigns \u2013 again, on both sides \u2013 were flawed and clouded by misinformation. Many myths have been exposed. Now we must check there is support for the facts of Brexit.\n\nA full account of The Independent's view is available here.\n\nIn 2016, the people were given their say on the principle of whether to stay in the EU or leave. Now the facts are becoming clearer, it\u2019s time for the people to have the final say on the real deal \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/cm/zn/LrCmzNDpjANplFh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1533746271"}
