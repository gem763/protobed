(MCK) is trading higher Wednesday on news that the drug distributor and other parties are in talks to settle over 2,000 lawsuits brought by state and local governments over the opioid epidemic. Let's check out the charts of MCK to see if this early price strength is sustainable.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of MCK, below, we can see prices made a deep selloff in late September and early October to test the rising 200-day moving average line. Prices have since rebounded to the upside and moved back above the 50-day moving average line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been improving lately and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal. We don't know where prices will close Wednesday but I suspect two things -- that we do not fill the gap from the opening and we do not close on the low of the day. This is entirely a \"gut feel\" and not linked to a math-driven indicator.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of MCK, below, we can see a bullish setup with respect to the price action and the indicators. Prices are trading above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is starting to turn upward again and the MACD oscillator is in a take profits sell mode but starting to narrow again toward a bullish crossover and buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MCK, below, we can see that a trade at $150.93 will be a significant upside breakout and that $182 is a potential price target based on the size of the accumulation pattern.\n\nBottom-line strategy: MCK is poised for an upside breakout on our Point and Figure chart Wednesday or perhaps Thursday. Traders need to respect this price strength and trade from the long side. Our Point and Figure price target is $182. Risk a close back below $140.", "description": "McKesson Is Poised to Make a Significant Upside Breakout...MCK", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Mckesson Is Poised To Make A Significant Upside Breakout", "Traders Need To Respect This Price Strength.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Mark Sebastian", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass", "Jim"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e0601677-f494-11e7-ae2e-03bdf91e225f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
