With [the infusion of artificial intelligence], we hope it will grow in wisdom to help people overcome even the most difficult troubles. It\u2019s changing Buddhism.\u201d\n\nWelcome to modern-day worship.\n\nFirst come the machine priests; next come the man-made machinery gods.\n\nIt\u2019s not just happening in Japan.\n\nIn China, an android \u201cmonk\u201d called Xian\u2019er provides spiritual guidance and recites mantras from the Buddhist faith to those visiting the Longquan Monastery in Beijing.\n\nIn India, one temple relies on a robotic hand to help with a religious ritual that\u2019s conducted in front of Ganesh, also spelled Ganesha, the Hindu\u2019s elephant-headed god of beginnings.\n\nThen there\u2019s SanTO, short for Sanctified Theomorphic Operator, a foot-and-a-half tall robot that\u2019s designed in the image of any number of statues that Catholic believers might place in their homes. Only SanTO talks; it\u2019s \u201cequipped with software it uses to listen to people, scan their faces for signs of specific emotions, and select religious texts that may be relevant to their troubles,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported. The device was aimed at providing biblical comfort to elderly people in nursing homes.\n\nAnother robot in Germany called BlessU-2 delivers biblical truths in several languages and offers, on demand, blessings to those of the Protestant faith \u2014 after first asking, that is, \u201cWould you like to be blessed by a female or male voice?\u201d\n\nWith more advanced A.I., it won\u2019t be long before these man-made priests become commonplace. From there, it\u2019s only a short hop and skip to manmade gods.\n\nHeck, that hop has already happened.\n\n\u201cChurch of the A.I. God is even creepier than I imagined,\u201d CNET reported in late 2017, about the Way of the Future, the name of a \u201cchurch\u201d founded by former Google, Waymo and Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski.\n\n\u201cWhat is going to be created will effectively be a god,\u201d Levandowski told Wired\u2019s Mark Harris.\n\nThe idea of worshipping artificial intelligence may still carry a bit of the shock factor; the idea may still seem blasphemous, outlandish, absurd, et cetera to the masses. But wait a few years.\n\nAutomation is becoming more mainstream. Artificial intelligence is popping everywhere. Mass surveillance and data collection, the food of A.I., are becoming more and more accepted, less and less problematic. And society, thanks in large part to the steady rise of the religious nones, is continuing its trend toward secularization.\n\nCherish your pastors while you\u2019ve got \u2018em.\n\nOne day, not too far in the future, it could be a face of metal and silicon that\u2019s doing the preaching.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
