Instead, Mr. Johnson delivered an uncompromising speech that echoed the frustrations of the Brexit majority in the country. For once they felt a politician was telling it the way it is.\n\nThe opposition had no problem with castigating the prime minister, but when he described Parliament\u2019s new law to stop a no-deal exit as a \u201cSurrender Act,\u201d one labour MP, Paula Sherriff, told him he should be \u201cabsolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d\n\nHe claimed the law had given away the U.K.\u2019s bargaining position with the EU, but to her he was using language that might endanger MP\u2019s safety. When he dismissed that as \u201cHumbug,\u201d they went nuts.\n\nThe opposition parties not only have a problem with criticism, but also with how much further they can undermine the prime minister and his minority government. The last thing they want is an election, which they could well lose.\n\nRemainers may dominate Parliament, the media and academia, but not the electorate. A point not lost on the Attorney General, Sir Geoffrey Cox, AKA \u201cThe baritone barrister.\u201d\n\nPrior to the prime minister\u2019s appearance, he excoriated Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labor Party by claiming, \u201cThey could vote no-confidence at any time, but they are too cowardly \u2026 This Parliament should have the courage to face the electorate, but it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd for his coup de grace, \u201cThe time is coming when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas.\u201d The Remainers\u2019 triumphal return after getting parliament reopened wasn\u2019t supposed to have been like this.\n\nThe out-going Speaker-of-the-House, John Bercow, later complained, \u201cThere was an atmosphere in the Chamber worse than any I\u2019ve known in my 22 years in the House.\u201d This was surely code for, the Remainers lost.\n\nIt is hard to fathom just what the government hoped to achieve by shutting down parliament for just a few days extra as MPs still had enough time to pass the \u201cSurrender Act.\u201d\n\nHowever, the \u201cprorogation\u201d as it is called, did scare the bejabers out of the Remainers and now both sides are considering risky, off-piste routes to try to win the Brexit battle.\n\nParliament is nervous that Mr. Johnson might try to introduce emergency powers to force a no-deal Brexit through on October 31.\n\nOne plan being rumored is to try to replace him through a no-confidence vote, once the time is right, and install a Remain supporter as prime minister.\n\nTo stop this leading to a risky general election, another idea is to call for a cross-party, government of national unity made up of Remainers. This is not to be confused with Abraham Lincoln\u2019s well-meaning attempt to attract Democrats in the second half of the American Civil War.\n\nA more accurate parallel \u2014 and with about as much chance of success \u2014 would be if the Confederates had tried to form a unity administration with disaffected Republicans.\n\nReplacing an elected government to thwart the democratic will of the British people really would amount to a coup, so it\u2019s hard to see those ideas going anywhere.\n\nThe big winner out of the proroguing Parliament debacle was the U.K. Supreme Court, which was only founded in 2009 and is the brainchild of the former Trotskyist, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair.\n\nThis was the second time the U.K.\u2019s highest court has overruled the U.K. government on Brexit. The first was to assert that Parliament would have the final vote on the EU withdrawal terms.\n\nAlthough sharing the same name as the U.S. legal body, the U.K. court differs in many ways. The American Supreme Court upholds the U.S. Constitution at a federal level, but Britain doesn\u2019t have one to defend, rather it has common law derived from legal precedent.\n\nAlso, the U.K. Supreme Court judges have no confirmation hearings and are appointed. When their function was just to uphold U.K. Common Law, no one minded, but this was also changed by Prime Minister Blair.\n\nIn 2005, his government introduced reforms so that judges could only be selected if they, \u201cdemonstrate a lifetime\u2019s commitment to Equality and Diversity,\u201d which could add a progressive filter to their judgements.\n\nThe Courts decision to overrule the government was defended by Stephanie Boyce, deputy vice-president of the Law Society, \u201cWe are all bound by law to accept that ruling \u2014 even those who wish it had gone another way.\u201d\n\nSo how about the establishment also being bound by the Brexit ruling of the British public?\n\n\u2022 Andrew Davies is a U.K.-based video producer and scriptwriter.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
