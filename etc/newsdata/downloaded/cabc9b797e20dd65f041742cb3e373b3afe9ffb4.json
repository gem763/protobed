The reactivation comes just over a year after the Navy reestablished its Second Fleet, which oversees the western half of the Atlantic up into the high north.\n\nSonar Technician (Submarines) 3rd Class Christopher T.

Richardson\n\nThe reestablishment of Submarine Group 2 is likewise \"aimed at enhancing the Navy's capacity to command and control its undersea warfare forces seamlessly across the entire Atlantic area, from the eastern seaboard of the United States to the Barents Sea, and even into the Southern Atlantic, if the need arises,\" the Navy said in a release.\n\nEchoing the comments of the Navy's top officer upon the reestablishment of Second Fleet, Vice Adm. Charles Richard, commander of US submarine forces in the Atlantic, cited the \"more challenging and complex\" security situation as the reason for the return of Group 2.\n\n\"To maintain America's undersea superiority, we must increase naval power and our readiness for high-end blue water warfare. How we're organized to command that employment will be a driving factor in our success \u2014 that's why we're re-establishing Sub Group 2 today,\" Richard said in the release.\n\nA submarine group, composed of squadrons, handles the organization, training, and equipping of those boats while they're state-side. Individual subs are attached to that squadron and group until they're assigned to a combatant command, six of which are responsible for operations in specific areas of the globe.\n\nA US Navy chief petty officer of the boat aboard pre-commissioned unit (PCU) South Dakota, directs his team while underway in the Atlantic Ocean, November 27, 2018. US Air Force/Senior Airman Jared Bunn\n\n\"Until [a submarine] makes that transition, it's part of Group 2,\" which owns it and operates it and tells it what to do, said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.\n\nReestablishing Submarine Group 2 doesn't necessarily mean there will be more subs prowling the Atlantic, but its return is important because the \"group is in charge of the movement and the command and control of the ship\" before it transitions over to combatant command, Clark said.\n\nWithout Group 2, the attention of command elements in the Atlantic was spread thin over a larger number of subs. Bringing back Group 2, Clark said, \"allows you to put more attention on the North Atlantic submarines.\"\n\n\"Along with the second fleet ... it's a way of putting more command and control and leadership attention on that part of the ocean,\" Clark added.\n\nBetter coordination, better command and control\n\nRussian Black Sea Fleet's B-265 Krasnodar Improved Kilo-class submarine. Russian MoD\n\nReestablishing Second Fleet and Submarine Group 2 are \"visible representations of the US commitment to the security in the Atlantic in an era of great power competition,\" Lt. Marycate Walsh, a spokesperson for Second Fleet, said in an email.\n\n\"Increased challenges and threats required a commensurate increase in capacity to address possible contingencies,\" Walsh said, adding that Group 2's operations in the region will add to and integrate with those of Second Fleet.\n\nSubmarine Group 2 also oversees anti-submarine warfare for US Fleet Forces Command and, when assigned, for Fourth Fleet. Fleet Forces Command organizes, trains, and equips naval forces for assignment to combatant commands, and Fourth Fleet is responsible for ships, subs, and aircraft operating around Central and South America.\n\nIn that role, Submarine Group 2 will \"employ combat-ready forces in [anti-submarine warfare] and undersea warfare operations across mission-essential sea-service functions,\" Cmdr. Jodie Cornell, a spokesperson for Submarine Forces Atlantic, said in an email.\n\nThe USS Rhode Island returns to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia after three months at sea.

James Foggo, head of US Naval Forces in Europe and Africa, said in late 2018. \"They've shown the capability to be able to reach pretty much all the capitals in Europe from any of the bodies of water that surround Europe.\"\n\nRanges of Russia's Kalibr missiles when fired from seas around Europe.

CSIS Missile Defense Project\n\nThe threat of sub-launched cruise missiles is \"certainly ... part of what this is intended to address,\" Clark said of Submarine Group 2. \"This gives better coordination and better command and control of those submarines.\"\n\nMore frequent deployments of more sophisticated Russian subs are driving more US naval activity in the Atlantic, which includes more deployments US Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft to Iceland, where they have a higher operational tempo.\n\nThose aircraft are in part managed by Group 2, Clark said. It helps \"having people at Group 2 being able to focus on that problem.\"", "description": "Russian naval activity around Europe is a growing concern, and the US Navy is reactivating command units to help manage its own forces in the region.", "authors": ["Christopher Woody"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0e3adcc4a0a2cc222b345?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
