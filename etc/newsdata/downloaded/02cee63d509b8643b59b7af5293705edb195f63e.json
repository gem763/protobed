(AP) - Will Harris struck out the side with just nine pitches, and then the glowering Houston reliever did something even rarer than an immaculate inning.\n\n\u201cWill never smiles - ever - on the field,\u201d Alex Bregman said. \u201cHe\u2019s always in a bad mood. That was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen him smile on a baseball field.\u201d\n\nThe Astros are accomplishing all sorts of unprecedented feats on their way to October, and their latest win left them grinning about the chance for at least one additional playoff game at home.\n\nBregman hit his 41st homer, Michael Brantley added a three-run shot in the eighth inning and Houston clinched home-field advantage throughout the AL playoffs with a 4-0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night.\n\nRookie Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (2-1) pitched six innings of three-hit ball and Harris threw the sixth immaculate inning in franchise history during the 10th win in 12 games for Houston (105-55), which extended its franchise record for victories.\n\nThe AL West champion Astros clinched home field in a potential AL Championship Series against the Yankees (103-57). Houston won four of seven over New York during the regular season to claim the tiebreaker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe play really well at home, so the less travel, the better. And we get more home games for our fans back in Houston. When you get this late in the season and you\u2019re still playing for stuff, it\u2019s nice to check boxes off, and we were able to do that again tonight.\u201d\n\nHouston will face either Tampa Bay or Oakland, who play Wednesday night in the AL wild-card game, in the Division Series. The Yankees and Minnesota will meet in the other ALDS.\n\nThe Astros also stayed one game ahead of the Dodgers, who have clinched the NL\u2019s best record. Houston beat Los Angeles in the 2017 World Series to claim its first championship, winning Game 7 on the road.\n\nIf the Astros and Dodgers finish with the same regular season record and meet in the World Series again, Houston would host Game 1 by virtue of its superior intradivisional record.\n\nThe Angels (72-88) managed just three singles and didn\u2019t get a runner to second base in their 11th shutout loss. Los Angeles would have to win its final two games to avoid finishing with the beleaguered franchise\u2019s worst record of the 21st century.\n\nBregman led off the second inning with his ninth homer in September, picking up the 111th RBI of his MVP-caliber season.\n\nThe Astros had just one hit between Bregman\u2019s shot and the eighth, where Brantley connected for his 22nd homer - his first extra-base hit since Sept. 9 - to deep center with two outs.\n\nIMMACULATE INNING\n\nHarris struck out Kaleb Cowart, Matt Thaiss and Michael Hermosillo - who helped out by swinging at a probable ball - for the Astros\u2019 first immaculate inning since 2004. Houston\u2019s dominant right-hander has allowed just two runs in his last 21 appearances.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a pretty good idea where the ball was going,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhen I struck out the first guy, I felt like I was going to strike out the side. It was kind of weird.\u201d\n\nSANDOVAL\u2019S SEASON\n\nPatrick Sandoval (0-4) finished his rookie season winless for the Angels, but still pitched two-hit ball into the fourth inning while on a 60-pitch count. The 22-year-old Mission Viejo native reached the majors in August as the 29th pitcher used by the Halos this season due to their numerous rotation problems.\n\n\u201cFrom the first outing, I think I did a pretty good job staying in the moment and letting my stuff play up here,\u201d Sandoval said of his rookie season. \u201cI had all the confidence in the world.\u201d\n\nROOKIE DEALS\n\nUrquidy made his increasingly strong case for a once-unlikely postseason rotation spot with another strong appearance in September.\n\nThe Mexican right-hander has allowed just three runs and 10 hits over 18 innings in four appearances this month. Urquidy has outpitched veteran Wade Miley, who once appeared certain to get the spot behind the Astros\u2019 big three starters. Manager AJ Hinch has said he won\u2019t make his decision on the fourth starter until later.\n\nMVP SHOWCASE\n\nBregman went 1 for 3 with a homer and a walk in the home stadium of his top rival for the AL MVP award. Mike Trout is out for the season with a right foot injury, but the two-time winner leads the league in on-base percentage, slugging percentage and WAR, and is tied for the lead in homers (45). Bregman leads in walks, is third in homers and OPS, and has more RBIs than Trout.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAstros: SS Carlos Correa\u2019s availability for the AL division series will be determined during workouts next week. He has made only 11 plate appearances since Aug. 19, and he is missing the final week of the regular season to rest his bad back.\n\nAngels: Tommy La Stella went 0 for 4 as the Angels\u2019 designated hitter in his first appearance since July 2, when he broke his leg on a foul ball. La Stella was selected for his first All-Star Game appearance shortly before the injury, which ruined the reward for his breakthrough season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJustin Verlander (20-6, 2.53 ERA) makes his final case for the AL Cy Young award when he faces Jos\u00e9 Su\u00e1rez (2-6, 7.34 ERA) in the regular season\u2019s penultimate game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Will Harris struck out the side with just nine pitches, and then the glowering Houston reliever did something even rarer than an immaculate inning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/astros_angels_baseball_97725_c0-138-3298-2060_s1770x1032.jpg?f66cf04a0497b973eee5d83538448a4788c4c715", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
