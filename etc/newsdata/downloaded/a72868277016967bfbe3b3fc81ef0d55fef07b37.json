We are currently in active negotiations with two investors and are working through final terms. We should be able to provide you a more complete update within the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nA Docker spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nWhile Docker may be able to secure additional capital, it's yet another company that finds itself in an ominous position after raising mounds of cash during the heady days earlier this decade. When Bearden joined in May, he became the fourth CEO and the third since 2017, replacing Steve Singh, a former senior executive at SAP. Docker's founder Solomon Hykes left the company last year, and Mariana Tessel, the executive vice president of strategic development, departed in 2017 for Intuit.\n\nDocker popularized the use of technology called containers to package up source code so that developers could easily move their applications around from laptops to servers and to the cloud. Administrators use containers on servers as an alternative to the virtual machine technology that helped VMware become a dominant force in the data center.\n\nDespite its widespread use, Docker's core software is open source, so anybody can download it for free and tinker with it. The company sells products to help businesses manage their deployments, but revenue hasn't taken off in a way that mirrors high-value subscription software players.", "description": "While Elastic and MongoDB have managed to build big businesses around their open-source software, Docker is looking to private investors to keep going.", "authors": ["Jordan Novet"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106153599-1569620191643dockercon20190501.jpg?v=1569620316", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
