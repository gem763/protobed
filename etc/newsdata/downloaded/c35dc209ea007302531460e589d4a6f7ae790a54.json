This isn\u2019t in any way an indictment on either novel \u2013 if anything, the differences between the two only highlight Donoghue\u2019s range \u2013 but knowing this might enable you to appreciate Akin for what it is: a touching, keenly observed novel (if less suspenseful than Room, told from the persepective of a boy held captive with his kidnapped mother), examining the complex dynamics of family.\n\nIt all begins when Noah (or No\u00e9, as he was known during his childhood in France) meets Michael, his great-nephew, who\u2019s in need of a new caretaker. Michael\u2019s father, Victor (Noah\u2019s nephew) died a year and a half prior, his veins \u201cfull of heroin and fentanyl\u201d. His mother, Amber, is behind bars after the police \u201cfound crack cocaine, meth, and oxycodone in her car\u201d. His grandmother Ella, who had been entrusted with his care, has just died. This all means that Noah, who has never even met his great-nephew, must now act as a temporary guardian for the 11-year-old boy. Neither Noah nor Michael is particularly pleased with this arrangement, though Noah \u2013 an almost 80-year-old, retired, widowed professor who\u2019s never had children of his own \u2013 feels a pull of duty towards his relative.\n\nNoah, as it happens, was just about to fly from New York City, where he occupies a tastefully decorated apartment on the Upper West Side, to Nice, the city of his childhood, where he was hoping to reconnect with his roots (and possibly elucidate the mystery of nine enigmatic photos found in a box of his late wife\u2019s belongings). One expedited passport request (for Michael) later, the 11-year-old joins his great-uncle on his transatlantic flight \u2013 leaving the beauty of their mismatched pairing to unfold from here on out.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The 25 best books by women 1/25 Pride and Prejudice \u2013 Jane Austen Austen remains one of history\u2019s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. 2/25 Their Eyes Were Watching God - Zora Neale Hurston Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It\u2019s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 3/25 The Lottery and Other Stories \u2013 Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948\u2019s The Lottery, which traces a small town\u2019s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. 4/25 To Kill a Mockingbird \u2013 Harper Lee A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time \u2013 it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world\u2019s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. 5/25 Kindred - Octavia E Butler Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It\u2019s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America\u2019s history on African-Americans today. 6/25 Jane Eyre \u2013 Charlotte Bront\u00eb Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name \u201cCurrer Bell\u201d, it feels likes a dive into the mind of Bront\u00eb herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it\u2019s as if she\u2019s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Bront\u00eb\u2019s own life. 7/25 Half of a Yellow Sun \u2013 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Adichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It\u2019s history via an achingly human lens. 8/25 White Teeth \u2013 Zadie Smith Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It\u2019s a tale of two men \u2013 Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones \u2013 who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 9/25 The Hour of the Star - Clarice Lispector Lispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macab\u00e9a, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector\u2019s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macab\u00e9a, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. 10/25 Mrs Dalloway \u2013 Virginia Woolf One of literature\u2019s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 11/25 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories \u2013 Flannery O\u2019Connor O\u2019Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story\u2019s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. 12/25 Persepolis \u2013 Marjane Satrapi At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi\u2019s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It\u2019s the political seen through the personal, but it\u2019s always Satrapi\u2019s own spirit that shines the brightest. 13/25 Frankenstein \u2013 Mary Shelley Many have now come to consider Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character\u2019s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley\u2019s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It\u2019s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man\u2019s unbridled power. 14/25 Beloved \u2013 Toni Morrison Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It\u2019s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory. 15/25 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 Margaret Atwood Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu\u2019s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it\u2019s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood\u2019s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant \u2013 and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn\u2019t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. 16/25 Middlemarch - George Eliot Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women\u2019s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light; set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. 17/25 Little Fires Everywhere \u2013 Celeste Ng Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one\u2019s hometown as a little like \u201cwriting about a relative\u201d, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents\u2019s obsession with structure and rules. 18/25 The Bell Jar \u2013 Sylvia Plath Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath\u2019s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book\u2019s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women\u2019s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther\u2019s frustration that has been a comfort to many. 19/25 My Brilliant Friend - Elena Ferrante My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante\u2019s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it\u2019s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 20/25 The Age of Innocence \u2013 Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York\u2019s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds \u2013 in every other way society\u2019s perfect vision of man and woman \u2013 find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society\u2019s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. 21/25 The Color Purple \u2013 Alice Walker Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker\u2019s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist\u2019s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It\u2019s no wonder that the book\u2019s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. 22/25 Rebecca \u2013 Daphne du Maurier Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn\u2019t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle; rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband\u2019s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 23/25 The God of Small Things - Arundhati Roy As Roy\u2019s debut novel, it\u2019s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book\u2019s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins\u2019s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 24/25 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha Christie We may know every twist and turn of Christie\u2019s best works by now, but there\u2019s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 25/25 The Tale of Genji \u2013 Murasaki Shikibu The oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what\u2019s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it\u2019s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan. 1/25 Pride and Prejudice \u2013 Jane Austen Austen remains one of history\u2019s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. 2/25 Their Eyes Were Watching God - Zora Neale Hurston Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers.

The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It\u2019s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 3/25 The Lottery and Other Stories \u2013 Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948\u2019s The Lottery, which traces a small town\u2019s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. 4/25 To Kill a Mockingbird \u2013 Harper Lee A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time \u2013 it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world\u2019s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. 5/25 Kindred - Octavia E Butler Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It\u2019s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America\u2019s history on African-Americans today. 6/25 Jane Eyre \u2013 Charlotte Bront\u00eb Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name \u201cCurrer Bell\u201d, it feels likes a dive into the mind of Bront\u00eb herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it\u2019s as if she\u2019s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Bront\u00eb\u2019s own life. 7/25 Half of a Yellow Sun \u2013 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Adichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It\u2019s history via an achingly human lens. 8/25 White Teeth \u2013 Zadie Smith Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It\u2019s a tale of two men \u2013 Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones \u2013 who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 9/25 The Hour of the Star - Clarice Lispector Lispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macab\u00e9a, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector\u2019s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil.

The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 11/25 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories \u2013 Flannery O\u2019Connor O\u2019Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story\u2019s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. 12/25 Persepolis \u2013 Marjane Satrapi At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi\u2019s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It\u2019s the political seen through the personal, but it\u2019s always Satrapi\u2019s own spirit that shines the brightest. 13/25 Frankenstein \u2013 Mary Shelley Many have now come to consider Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character\u2019s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley\u2019s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It\u2019s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man\u2019s unbridled power. 14/25 Beloved \u2013 Toni Morrison Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It\u2019s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory. 15/25 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 Margaret Atwood Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu\u2019s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it\u2019s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood\u2019s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant \u2013 and prescient.

The book\u2019s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women\u2019s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther\u2019s frustration that has been a comfort to many. 19/25 My Brilliant Friend - Elena Ferrante My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante\u2019s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it\u2019s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 20/25 The Age of Innocence \u2013 Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York\u2019s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds \u2013 in every other way society\u2019s perfect vision of man and woman \u2013 find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society\u2019s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. 21/25 The Color Purple \u2013 Alice Walker Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker\u2019s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist\u2019s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It\u2019s no wonder that the book\u2019s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. 22/25 Rebecca \u2013 Daphne du Maurier Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn\u2019t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle; rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband\u2019s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 23/25 The God of Small Things - Arundhati Roy As Roy\u2019s debut novel, it\u2019s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book\u2019s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins\u2019s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 24/25 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha Christie We may know every twist and turn of Christie\u2019s best works by now, but there\u2019s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 25/25 The Tale of Genji \u2013 Murasaki Shikibu The oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what\u2019s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it\u2019s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.\n\nWorlds collide as soon as Michael, who\u2019s from \u201cone of the last pockets of Brooklyn resistant to gentrification\u201d, enters Noah\u2019s prim flat on the Upper West Side. Worlds most definitely keep colliding as Noah tries to enjoy the fine delicacies France has to offer \u2013 while Michael, who\u2019s never left the US (and possibly New York City) before, understandably struggles to adapt to his new surroundings.\n\nAkin, in many ways, is built upon everything that sets Noah and Michael apart. Noah\u2019s relatively cushy background (he\u2019s a wealthy academic and the descendant of a famous photographer, but there\u2019s no forgetting that his mother sent him away from France to the US while Italy, then Germany, invaded his native country during the Second World War) contrasts with Michael\u2019s life in poverty, where his menus depend on what\u2019s left at the food pantry, his most prized possession is a pair of Nike sneakers his grandmother bought for him on layaway, and the opioid crisis that snatched both of his parents from him.\n\nAnd yet, for all the brilliance in Donoghue\u2019s mismatched pair (every time we might be tempted to find Michael slightly annoying, she\u2019s a master at showing us, and reminding us, that he\u2019s just a child raised with virtually no stability due to forces far beyond his control), the novel is at its strongest when it highlights the resemblances that unite Michael and Noah. These go from the relatively mundane (Michael, much like Noah\u2019s ancestor, seems to have a knack for photography, except he chooses to explore it through his smartphone rather than an old camera) to the more profound (both are wrestling with the uncertainties of their families\u2019 lives). There\u2019s strength in their pairing, too, as Noah might know a lot, technically, about the world and its history, but Michael is in many ways better versed than him when it comes to understanding the contemporary way of things.\n\nThrough the mysteries of Michael and Noah\u2019s respective upbringings (Noah wrestles with the possibility that his mother might have collaborated with the Nazis, while discovering that Victor and Amber\u2019s plight might be more complex than expected), Donoghue delivers a profound reflection on family secrets and the way they shape our current identities. Her profoundly human portrayal of Michael elicits a crucial form of empathy for the lives disrupted by the opioid crisis and raises questions on its impact on generations to come. All this makes Akin an important, touching novel that stays with you long after you\u2019re done reading it.\n\n\u2018Akin\u2019 is published on 3 October by Pan Macmillan in the UK (\u00a316.99) and is out on Little, Brown in the US ($28)", "description": "If you found Emma Donoghue through Room, the 2010 bestselling novel that landed her on the Man Booker Prize shortlist, then you should know that Akin, her first contemporary novel for adults since Room, is very different in tone, style and substance.", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/15/akin-donoghue-emma.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
