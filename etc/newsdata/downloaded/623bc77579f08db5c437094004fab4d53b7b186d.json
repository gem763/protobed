REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\n(Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Wednesday he does not expect the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump to affect how the Fed conducts monetary policy.\n\nBullard said in an interview with CNBC that Fed officials are used to dealing with political uncertainty as a backdrop to policy deliberations. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound all that different to me,\u201d he said.\n\nBullard, who dissented on the Fed\u2019s rate reduction last week because he favored a deeper cut, also reiterated his view that the Fed\u2019s target rate should be reduced by an additional quarter of a percentage point by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a big move,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we could do a little bit more.\u201d Still he said he doesn\u2019t want to make a judgment before the next meeting and that his decision will depend on economic data.\n\nIn response to a question about Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren\u2019s view that low rates could encourage people and businesses to take excessive risk, Bullard said the risks seen today are not on the same magnitude as the risks encountered in the late 1990s and mid 2000s.\n\nBullard called the trade war with China the \u201cbiggest issue\u201d in the economy. He said the dispute became more \u201cpernicious\u201d than expected and added it could be \u201ca while\u201d before agreements are reached.\n\n\u201cI think the Chinese might have incentive to wait out this administration,\u201d he said.", "description": "St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Wednesday he does not expect the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump to affect how the Fed conducts monetary policy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433888979&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1ZS", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
