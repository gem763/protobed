Likewise, about 80,886 illegal aliens were charged with misdemeanors for illegally entering the country and nearly 4,300 individuals were charged with smuggling illegal aliens.\n\n\u201cThese record-breaking numbers are a testament to the dedication of our U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the nation, especially our Southwest border offices,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen in a statement. \u201cIn addition to the usual workload of each case the Department prosecutes, this effort was made possible after our U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices restored essential partnerships with national, state and local law enforcement partners.\u201d\n\nTrump has increased number of illegal aliens prosecuted with misdemeanors for entering the U.S. illegally by more than 420 percent since Fiscal Year 2004 under the Bush administration. Similarly, Trump has reversed the falling number of previously deported illegal aliens prosecuted after Obama decreased the number for six years in a row.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration completed about 275,000 cases, which is the second highest number of completed cases for a single year in the court\u2019s history.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
