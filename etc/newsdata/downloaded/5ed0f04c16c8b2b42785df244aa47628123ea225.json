House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Trump had a \"meltdown\" and she was praying for his health. Using his patented I'm-rubber-you're-glue strategy, Trump responded that Pelosi had an \"unhinged meltdown\" \u2014 posting a photo that didn't appear to have the intended effect \u2014 and tweeted \"Pray for her.\"\n\nThe 20-minute meeting started with Trump saying he didn't want to be there, The New York Times reports, citing several Democratic officials and noting that \"the White House did not dispute their accounts.\" Trump brought up a bizarre letter he sent to Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, claiming his \"nasty\" missive shows he didn't green-light Turkey's invasion of Syria. Pelosi noted that the House had just overwhelmingly condemned Trump's decision to withdraw the handful of U.S. troops that had been keeping Turkey at bay.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) started to read Trump a quote from his former defense secretary, James Mattis, at which point Trump called Mattis \"the world's most overrated general\" because \"he wasn't tough enough\" and \"I captured ISIS\" faster than he'd said was possible. Pelosi said Russia has long sought a \"foothold in the Middle East\" and he had just given Russian President Vladimir Putin such an opening, adding: \"All roads with you lead to Putin.\" That's when the already-tense meeting \"reached a fever pitch,\" the Times reports.\n\nThe Associated Press recounts the next few exchanges:\n\nTrump: \"I hate ISIS more than you do.\"\n\nPelosi: \"You don't know that.\"\n\nSchumer: \"Is your plan to rely on the Syrians and the Turks?\"\n\nTrump: \"Our plan is to keep the American people safe.\"\n\nPelosi: \"That's not a plan. That's a goal.\"\n\nAfter Trump called Pelosi either a \"third-rate\" or \"third-grade\" politician, House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said \"this is not useful,\" and the Democrats walked out. Trump said: \"Goodbye, we'll see you at the polls.\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said of the meeting: \"The president was measured, factual, and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi's decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising.\"", "description": "Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House to discuss the mess in Syria on Wednesday, and it didn't go well.
