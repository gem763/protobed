He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nTrump said that al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest as he was trapped in a tunnel with his three children as American forces approached.\n\n\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe said that the tunnel caved in on al-Baghdadi\u2019s mutilated body but that test results proved that it was him.\n\nTrump said that American special forces landed with eight helicopters and blew holes into the side of the terrorist compound.\n\nHe described that raid as \u201cabsolutely perfect, as though you were watching a movie.\u201d\n\nTrump said that no American troops were wounded in the operation, but that \u201ca beautiful dog, a talented dog\u201d that was part of the canine units was wounded but brought back for treatment.\n\n\u201cThey did a lot of shooting, and they did a lot of blasting,\u201d Trump said, praising the Special Forces.\n\nThe president also singled out American intelligence agencies for praise.\n\n\u201cThank you, as well, to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump used the occasion to send a message to all radical Islamic terrorists in the world.\n\n\u201cThese savage monsters will not escape their fate, and they will not escape the final judgment of God,\u201d he said.\n\nThe military operation was conducted by American Special Forces Delta Force after it was approved by Trump, according to reports, after Al-Baghdadi was discovered by American intelligence in Syria\u2019s northwestern Idlib province.\n\nAl-Baghdadi first appeared in 2014 establishing the ISIS caliphate with him as the caliph. For five years, ISIS and al-Baghdadi inspired terrorist attacks around the world against Western forces.\n\nThe world has spent years trying to capture or kill al-Baghdadi, a major step in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State and radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nTrump said that he was adamant about finding al-Baghdadi as soon as he took office as president.\n\n\u201cCapturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president thanked also thanked several foreign countries for their assistance, singling out Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq for their cooperation and the Syrian Kurds for their support.\n\nTrump said that he did not inform Democrat Congressional leaders about the Saturday raid, for fear of leaks that would endanger the troops in the operation.\n\n\u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere is no country in the world that leaks like we do and Washington is a leaking machine.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted to the news of the death of the terrorist by calling for the House to be, \u201cbriefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump announced Sunday that ISIS founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has died after a military special forces attack.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trump-photo-cropped-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
