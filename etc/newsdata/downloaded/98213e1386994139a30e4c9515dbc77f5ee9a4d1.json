It is currently closed while investigations continue.\n\nSpeaking last month, Edward Spencer-Churchill - half-brother of the current Duke of Marlborough - said he was relaxed about security for the artwork.\n\n\"It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright John Lawrence Image caption Blenheim Palace is currently closed to the public while police investigate\n\nVisitors to the exhibition were free to use the palace's throne for its intended purpose, with a three-minute time limit to avoid queues.\n\nDet Insp Jess Milne, said: \"The piece of art that has been stolen is a high-value toilet made out of gold that was on display at the palace.\n\n\"We believe a group of offenders used at least two vehicles during the offence.\n\n\"The artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Blenheim Palace said it would remain shut for the rest of the day, but would reopen on Sunday.\n\nPalace chief executive Dominic Hare said they were \"saddened by this extraordinary event, but also relieved no-one was hurt\".\n\n\"We hope that the wonderful work of our dear friend Maurizio Cattelan becomes immortalised by this stupid and pointless act,\" he added.\n\nThe gold toilet was famously offered to US President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nThe arrested man is in police custody.", "description": "A 66-year-old man has been arrested over the theft of the toilet, which was part of an exhibition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07ncgjm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
