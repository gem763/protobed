Maybe President Trump has something on him. I\u2019m not really sure, but of all the rotating cast of dissembling buffoons in the Trump administration, the once-anonymous Ross is putting in a serious bid to be the biggest liar of them all.\n\nRoss\u2019 greatest scandal, so far at least, remains the U.S. Census, and his clear lies under oath to Congress. Though that story has mostly gone away, the investigations haven\u2019t, and Ross\u2019 fate is very much up for grabs.", "description": "Once again, the commerce secretary has baldly lied for a president who has contempt for him.
