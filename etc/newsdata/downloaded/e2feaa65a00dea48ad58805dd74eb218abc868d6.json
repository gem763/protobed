Approval for President Trump among white evangelical Protestants is 25 points higher than the national average. And according to a Pew Research Center survey, \u201cWhite evangelical Protestants who regularly attend church (that is, once a week or more) approve of Trump at rates matching or exceeding those of white evangelicals who attend church less often.\u201d Indeed, during the period from July 2018 to January 2019, 70 percent of white evangelicals who attend church at least once a week approved of Trump, versus 65 percent of those who attend religious services less often.\n\nThe enthusiastic, uncritical embrace of President Trump by white evangelicals is among the most mind-blowing developments of the Trump era. How can a group that for decades\u2014and especially during the Bill Clinton presidency\u2014insisted that character counts and that personal integrity is an essential component of presidential leadership not only turn a blind eye to the ethical and moral transgressions of Donald Trump, but also constantly defend him? Why are those who have been on the vanguard of \u201cfamily values\u201d so eager to give a man with a sordid personal and sexual history a mulligan?\n\nPart of the answer is their belief that they are engaged in an existential struggle against a wicked enemy\u2014not Russia, not North Korea, not Iran, but rather American liberals and the left. If you listen to Trump supporters who are evangelical (and non-evangelicals, like the radio talk-show host Mark Levin), you will hear adjectives applied to those on the left that could easily be used to describe a Stalinist regime. (Ask yourself how many evangelicals have publicly criticized Trump for his lavish praise of Kim Jong Un, the leader of perhaps the most savage regime in the world and the worst persecutor of Christians in the world.)\n\nMany white evangelical Christians, then, are deeply fearful of what a Trump loss would mean for America, American culture, and American Christianity. If a Democrat is elected president, they believe, it might all come crashing down around us. During the 2016 election, for example, the influential evangelical author and radio talk-show host Eric Metaxas said, \u201cIn all of our years, we faced all kinds of struggles. The only time we faced an existential struggle like this was in the Civil War and in the Revolution when the nation began \u2026 We are on the verge of losing it as we could have lost it in the Civil War.\u201d A friend of mine described that outlook to me this way: \u201cIt\u2019s the Flight 93 election. FOREVER.\u201d\n\nMany evangelical Christians are also filled with grievances and resentments because they feel they have been mocked, scorned, and dishonored by the elite culture over the years. (Some of those feelings are understandable and warranted.) For them, Trump is a man who will not only push their agenda on issues such as the courts and abortion; he will be ruthless against those they view as threats to all they know and love. For a growing number of evangelicals, Trump\u2019s dehumanizing tactics and cruelty aren\u2019t a bug; they are a feature. Trump \u201cowns the libs,\u201d and they love it. He\u2019ll bring a Glock to a cultural knife fight, and they relish that.", "description": "Support for Trump comes at a high cost for Christian witness.", "authors": ["Peter Wehner", "Contributing Editor At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTX35OJH/facebook.jpg?1562296437", "published_at": "2019-07-05"}
