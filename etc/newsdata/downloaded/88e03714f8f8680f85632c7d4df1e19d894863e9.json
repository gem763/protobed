Canva has 15 million users and turned a modest maiden profit in the first half of 2017-18.\n\nThe company\u2019s three founders \u2013 chief executive Melanie Perkins, her fiance Cliff Obrecht and chief technology officer Cameron Adams \u2013 rank higher on the list this year after our researchers found that the trio (plus their 800 staff, all of whom have equity) still own more than half of the company.\n\nCanva might only be five years old, but it\u2019s now worth seven times as much as Here There & Everywhere, the 30-year-old, ASX-listed media and entertainment business.\n\nGreensill Capital is another rapid growth story. It was only 2011 when the Greensill farming family from Bundaberg got into the supply-chain financing game. Their eponymous business, of which 38-year-old Peter Greensill is a director, was valued at just over $5 billion when Japan\u2019s SoftBank bought a slice in May.\n\nBen Simmons, 23, of the Philadelphia 76ers is one the youngest on the list with total wealth of $243 million. Getty\n\nThat is the same size as Bendigo Bank, and 50 per cent larger than Bank of Queensland \u2013 examples of the traditional lenders that 42-year-old founder Lex Greensill says have generally failed to provide working capital finance to small-to-medium enterprises, forcing them into more expensive invoice financing.\n\nSoftware-as-a-service businesses such as Atlassian and Canva, which rely on subscriptions for the bulk of their revenue, are responsible for 11 of the 100 fortunes on this year\u2019s list, while e-commerce or online marketplace businesses, such as Allon\u2019s Compass or Collis and Cyan Ta\u2019eed\u2019s self-funded Envato, have made 25 of the fortunes.\n\nThose numbers are down from 13 and 28 respectively in 2018, not because of any re-rating of technology companies, but because Australian basketballers are infiltrating the ranks of the United States\u2019 National Basketball Association (NBA) like never before.\n\nThe eight Australians playing in the NBA had total gross on-court earnings of $92.8 million in the 2018-19 financial year, an unheard-of amount that speaks to a world-class junior development system, and the resurgence of the local National Basketball League in recent years under the ownership of Rich Lister Larry Kestelman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSix of those eight hoopsmen have made it onto the Young Rich List, and five for the first time, including Ben Simmons.\n\nThe Melbourne-born 23-year-old is in 93rd spot on the list, and seems destined to rise even higher thanks to a $243 million, five-year deal inked with his Philadelphia 76ers in July. That\u2019s the most lucrative contract ever signed by an Australian athlete.\n\nThe 2019 list has 27 debutants. Along with the basketballers there are the three co-founders of cross-border payments disrupter Airwallex.\n\nThe company was born in 2015 when Jack Zhang and Max Li discovered how much small businesses were being charged in foreign exchange spreads when importing products from overseas \u2013 in their case it was $700 in forex costs when spending $15,000 on Chinese-made stock for their new cafe in Melbourne.\n\nActor Margot Robbie debuts on the list with $35 million gross earnings placing her in 86th spot. Invision\n\nJoining with university friends Lucy Liu, Xijing Dai and Ki-Lok Wong, they built an alternative payments system that claims to offer near-wholesale spreads to retail customers, with an algorithm which is claimed to route payments from sender to receiver in the cheapest and fastest way possible, automating foreign exchange conversion along the way.\n\nThe financials of Cayman Islands-based Airwallex remain a mystery to the public, but presumably not to investors who have poured in $300 million at a $1.4 billion valuation, making the five founders paper multi-millionaires. Wong misses the list because he\u2019s 41; Liu is a New Zealand citizen, having moved there from China when she was 12.\n\nLast year 10 women made the Young Rich List; now there are nine, although three of them are in the top 10. New in 2019 is movie star Margot Robbie, whose $35 million gross earnings in 2018-19 puts her in 86th spot.\n\nDespite many of the Young Rich Listers\u2019 companies quickly usurping their older counterparts in terms of market capitalisation, a 9 per cent female representation on the 2019 list is barely better than that of the ASX 200, where only 6 per cent of companies are run by women.\n\nA Financial Review survey late last year of Australia\u2019s top 10 backers of young growth companies found that 35 per cent of their investees had a female co-founder, up from 26 per cent a year earlier.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping more of those businesses will rise into the Young Rich.\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
