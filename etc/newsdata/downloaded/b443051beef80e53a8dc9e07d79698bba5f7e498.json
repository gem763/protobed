But as cars become internet-connected and hooked up to apps, security flaws have allowed researchers to remotely hijack or track vehicles.\n\nOne Seattle-based car owner told TechCrunch that their app pulled in information from several other accounts. He said that both he and a friend, who are both Mercedes owners, had the same car belonging to another customer, in their respective apps but every other account detail was different.\n\nThe car owners we spoke to said they were able to see the car\u2019s recent activity, including the locations of where it had recently been, but they were unable to track the real-time location using the app\u2019s feature.\n\nWhen he contacted Mercedes-Benz, a customer service representative told him to \u201cdelete the app\u201d until it was fixed, he said.\n\nThe other car owner we spoke to said he opened the app and found it also pulled in someone else\u2019s profile.\n\n\u201cI got in contact with the person who owns the car that was showing up,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI could see the car was in Los Angeles, where he had been, and he was in fact there,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that he wasn\u2019t sure if the app has exposed his private information to another customer.\n\n\u201cPretty bad fuck up in my opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first customer reported that the \u201clock and unlock\u201d and the engine \u201cstart and stop\u201d features did not work on his app, somewhat limiting the impact of the security lapse. The other customer said they did not attempt to test either feature.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the security lapse happened or how widespread the problem was. A spokesperson for Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Google Play\u2019s rankings, more than 100,000 customers have installed the app.\n\nA similar security lapse hit Credit Karma\u2019s mobile app in August. The credit monitoring company admitted that users were inadvertently shown other users\u2019 account information, including details about credit card accounts and balances. But despite disclosing other people\u2019s information, the company denied a data breach.", "description": "Mercedes-Benz car owners have said that the app they used to remotely locate, unlock and start their cars was displaying other people\u2019s account and vehicle information.
