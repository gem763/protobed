This analysis is idiosyncratic, to say the least (he politely refers to Marx\u2019s \u201cclassic\u201d analysis and \u201ccanonical\u201d recent work by Thomas Piketty only to dismiss them as outdated). And it leads him to the conclusion that at the heart of inequality today is a conflict between elite labor and non-elite labor, between those who manage to get into Yale and those who don\u2019t, but not between bosses and workers.\n\nWhat this means, for Markovits, is that if the lot of non-elites is to improve, they need to focus their efforts not on their traditional antagonists, whom they\u2019ve taken on in earlier eras through labor unions and class warfare. Instead, they need to look for ways to reform the meritocratic class, to reduce its power, and redistribute the advantages that it has hoarded for so many years.\n\nThe elite has to change, but Markovits is eager to avoid an outright overthrow of the meritocrats, about whom he remains ambivalent, and even admiring. Throughout the book, he vacillates between the idea that meritocracy is a thin ideological veneer protecting a new aristocracy\u2014and the idea that those who succeed at the race really are special, if overcompensated. The first sentence of the book states: \u201cMerit is a sham.\u201d He adds, \u201cmerit itself is not a genuine excellence but rather\u2014like the false virtues that aristocrats trumpeted in the ancien r\u00e9gime\u2014a pretense, constructed to rationalize an unjust distribution of advantage.\u201d But later, he slams meritocratic inequality\u2019s \u201cbefuddled\u201d progressive critics, who \u201cinstead of attacking meritocrats ... attack the idea of merit itself.\u201d But he cautions against the \u201csanctimonious anger wielded by inequality\u2019s critics,\u201d because inequality \u201ccannot be resolved by identifying villains.\u201d\n\nUltimately he decides that meritocracy is so burdensome that even the elites who benefit from it would gladly throw it off. In the meritocratic experience, he locates a lifelong salt mine for elites. From birth, an elite child is conditioned for success in the knowledge economy. Life begins with competitive preschools, enrichment instead of play, and risk-averse parents who make sure their kids do plenty of test prep with expensive tutors and play with other elite children. (At one elite elementary school, fifth-grade students were given a new problem to solve each day but no allotted time to work on it, so that they could learn \u201cto snatch a few extra minutes of work time by multitasking or by sacrificing recess.\u201d) While most parents don\u2019t shell out money for fake test scores or bribe sailing coaches, they do engage their kids in assisted striving from day one.\n\nThe striving only intensifies in adulthood, when elites work exceptionally hard in order to compete. Bankers hours used to mean a 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. business day. Today, \u201cbanker 9-to-5\u201d means working from 9 a.m. to 5 a.m. the next day. \u201cOne young professional,\u201d Markovits writes, \u201crecently compared his income-and-work package to being paid $3 million to fight Mike Tyson.\u201d The elites, Markovits argues, accrue enviable privileges through these exertions, but at the cost of their time and their souls. As far as he can see, no one is benefiting from the current system\u2014neither the underpaid, underemployed subordinates, nor the frazzled, overworked top tier.\n\nLife begins with competitive preschools, enrichment instead of play, and risk-averse parents who make sure their kids do plenty of test prep.\n\nHis solution to skyrocketing inequality then is this: a political alliance between the overworked elite and the underemployed middle class to bring us back to, essentially, the Keynesian compromise of midcentury, when merit mattered but education and work were not extreme sports. He envisions a coalition of superordinate and subordinate workers, which would demand that government direct innovation toward creating middle-class jobs, and that universities be transformed from small and competitive to large and egalitarian. He has faith that superordinate workers will be willing to set aside some wealth and prestige in order to slow down their rat race, and the rest of us, of course, would like to stop losing.\n\nIt would be nice if the neat wave of a technocratic wand\u2014a few policy initiatives here, a little innovation there\u2014could close the widening gap between rich and poor. But, unfortunately, Markovits\u2019s attempt to reimagine class struggle, while neatly omitting capitalists from his story, doesn\u2019t quite hold.\n\nLet\u2019s think for a second about class within twenty-first\u2013century capitalism. On the one hand, many people are being pushed into precarious, de-skilled work. Manufacturing jobs shed during the 2008 recession have largely been replaced with poorly paid, nonunionized service-sector jobs. Vast capital invested in technology blows up the taxi industry, turning it from a bastion of solid-ish working-class jobs into an app-driven hell with one billionaire atop a vast precariat. A Marxist might call this proletarianization\u2014people who formerly held comfortable jobs become downwardly mobile, often through technological innovations, while capitalists gain money and power. Obviously capitalists\u2014investors and owners of companies\u2014stand to gain from this, and they have.\n\nThen there\u2019s a third group of people who are trickier to categorize: people who work for a living but are as rich as some of the capitalists. On the one hand, these are certainly workers, in that they are paid for labor. On the other hand, it would be absurd to think of members of the one percent or five percent as working class. In order to do so, Markovits gets creative with the definition of labor income. For example, he categorizes Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s founder\u2019s shares in Facebook as labor income, because Mark Zuckerberg did the work of founding Facebook. This analysis is particular to Markovits, because, to many analysts, founder\u2019s stock and partnership shares fall squarely into the category of capital income, whether or not their recipients work. Cornelius Vanderbilt worked hard, too, and no one would have said this disqualified him from being a capitalist, or meant that his railroad stock should be treated as labor income.\n\nOther cases appear less clear-cut. There is immense blurriness these days at the top of the economic hierarchy. CEOs work for a living, under the oversight of a board, but they\u2019ve long been paid partly in shares. Are they capitalists or workers? In the end, it helps to think in terms of allegiance. CEOs are paid in stock for a reason\u2014it aligns their interests with those of the company. Zuckerberg owes his wealth to Facebook\u2019s continued performance as a company, not just his own labor. Recently, Matt Yglesias, a political writer and co-founder of Vox, tweeted that while, as a writer, he was in Vox\u2019s union, he still held founder\u2019s shares in Vox and therefore had stayed off the bargaining committee. Presumably he was concerned that his advocacy would be compromised.\n\nSimilarly, there have now been decades of theorizing over whether elite professionals are so rich and powerful that they\u2019re some new kind of class unto themselves. Again, it helps to think in terms of allegiances. In a section called \u201cThe Income Defense Industry,\u201d Markovits allows people richer than the superordinate workers to make a rare and ghostly appearance. \u201cMeritocratic inequality creates incentives for the most skilled workers to grow rich by devoting themselves to defending still richer people\u2019s fortunes against government encroachment.\u201d By and large, the interests of those at the top of the economic hierarchy are as aligned as ever.\n\nThis is reinforced later in the book when Markovits shows just how classically awful this meritocratic elite is. It turns out that elites may have more liberal social views than the rest of the population, but the richer you are, the more economically conservative you are, meritocracy or no. The richest fifth, he tells us, citing a study, \u201care much more hostile than the bottom four-fifths to progressive taxation, economic regulation, and social welfare spending.\u201d The top one percent are even more conservative, and \u201cthe extremely rich are extremely economically conservative.\u201d Further, he says, citing a study of Yale Law students, they are \u201cmuch more efficiency-minded and much, much less equality-minded than typical Americans.\u201d Despite surveys that show that the majority of workers would trade some money for some time, meritocrats are not exactly poised to join the proletarianized masses in demanding equality. This sounds like a classic, capital-aligned elite, not likely to make common cause with the downtrodden workers of America anytime soon.\n\nThroughout the book, Markovits dips into research he did in St. Clair Shores, Michigan\u2014a town that once benefited from the excellent wages of the Detroit auto industry\u2014to quote people telling him about a gentler, less stratified middle-class life when you didn\u2019t have to go to a fancy school to live well. Implicit in these portraits, and explicit by the end of the book, is a plea for the restoration of this good, middle-class, 1950s sort of life, when the gap between rich and middle class was smaller, and college admissions less competitive. Everyone, it seems, would be happier.\n\nIt\u2019s an appealing idea, and one that belies any sense of history. The relative equality of midcentury was the result of a brutal struggle between capital and labor, one that, due to labor\u2019s strength, resulted for a time in a decent postwar life for working-class people. Detroit was a prominent site of struggle. Everyone enjoyed a relatively robust welfare state and not-totally gutted labor law. The residents of St. Clair Shores weren\u2019t beneficiaries of a kinder elite, but of a bloody labor struggle that had temporarily triumphed. Inflation benefited working people by making debt cheap and essentially transferred money from bondholders by depreciating financial assets. The revolt of capital following this period kicked off the transition to neoliberalism, a system in which the welfare state is pared back, privatizing risk, even as it remains active in the protection of markets.\n\nThe only successful assaults on inequality at midcentury, and the only successful ones of late, have been driven by populists. The very idea of the one percent, which Markovits uses throughout his book, was promoted by a populist movement widely decried by meritocrats who were frustrated that the protests lacked sophisticated policy solutions. And the desires of these populist movements have repeatedly been thwarted by the investment of mega-capitalists in politics, whether fomenting AstroTurfed anti-tax rebellions, or giving generously to politicians. Elite professionals know which side their bread is buttered on, and make huge salaries serving the interests of capital. It\u2019s not impossible to imagine some of these elites coming over to the populist side, as happened during the New Deal, but if and when they do, it\u2019ll be a measure of popular power, not because they\u2019ve decided to sacrifice money and influence for vacation days.\n\nIn the end, Markovits has an oddly optimistic view of the elite that he is part of and that he trains at Yale. The compromise he proposes depends on it. \u201cThese hopes\u201d of a great compromise, he writes, \u201cinvoke virtues\u2014clarity of mind and the capacity to convert understanding into effective action\u2014that are themselves commonly associated with meritocracy. And there is no contradiction in thinking that meritocracy might solve its own problem, unlock its own trap, to recover its original democratic promise and refashion an open, fair society whose elite does well by promoting the public good.\u201d Markovits might have been well-served by paying more attention to Michael Young\u2019s original satire of meritocracy, in which the elites, so sure of their own enlightenment, fail to see the revolt coming until it\u2019s too late.", "description": "Ultra-educated, highly paid, overworked elites are not partners in the struggle to reform an unequal system.", "authors": ["Sarah Leonard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/b2a56ad8977150c0c19c7a7fbca48e62ca6b1d85.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
