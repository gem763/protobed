He threw for 337 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions for a 141.1 rating in the Vikings\u2019 42-30 win at Detroit. \u2026 The Lions\u2019 Matthew Stafford has 40,277 yards passing in 147 games, the first player to reach 40,000 in 150 games or fewer. \u2026 Detroit WR Marvin Jones Jr. had four TD catches, making him the fourth player in NFL history to have at least four in two games, joining Jerry Rice, Sterling Sharpe and Bob Shaw. \u2026 Cordarrelle Patterson\u2019s 102-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in Chicago\u2019s 36-25 loss to New Orleans was the seventh of his career, tied for third in NFL history behind only Josh Cribbs and Leon Washington, who each had eight.\n\n___\n\nSTREAKS & STATS\n\nBuffalo\u2019s streak of 13 games of not allowing 250 yards passing ended as Miami\u2019s Ryan Fitzpatrick was 23 of 35 for 282 yards - but the Bills won 31-21. \u2026 Indianapolis has not allowed a 100-yard runner in 24 straight games.\n\n___\n\nSTARTS\n\nSan Francisco beat Washington 9-0 to improve to 6-0 for the first time since 1990, when the 49ers began the season 10-0. They\u2019re also the sixth team since 1990 and the first since the 2005 New England Patriots to allow seven or fewer points and 200 or fewer net yards of offense in three consecutive games. \u2026 Cincinnati lost 27-17 to Jacksonville to fall to 0-7 for the first time in 11 years.\n\n___\n\nRAPID RODGERS\n\nGreen Bay\u2019s Aaron Rodgers passed for 429 yards with five touchdowns, including the 350th of his career, and no interceptions - and also ran for a score - in the Packers\u2019 42-24 win over Oakland. Appearing in his 172nd game, Rodgers surpassed Drew Brees (180 games) as the fastest quarterback to reach 350 TD passes. Rodgers is also the third player with at least 400 yards passing, five TD tosses and a rushing TD in a game in NFL history, joining Norm Van Brocklin and Mark Rypien. He also became the third player in the Super Bowl era with five TD throws and a TD run in a game, joining Rypien and Mark Malone.\n\n___\n\nBARKLEY BACK\n\nSaquon Barkley returned after missing three games with a sprained right ankle, but was held to 72 yards rushing and a touchdown in the New York Giants\u2019 27-21 loss to Arizona. While Barkley said his ankle felt fine, he only had two rushes of 10 yards or more. Half of his 18 rushes were for either negative yards (three) or between just 1 and 3 yards (six).\n\n___\n\nMARCUS MAKES MARK\n\nIn his debut for Baltimore cornerback Marcus Peters had a 67-yard interception return for a touchdown to help the Ravens win 30-16 at Seattle. It marked the fifth interception-return touchdown of his career, tied for the third most by a player in his first five seasons in NFL history. Only Ken Houston (nine) and Lem Barney (six) had more. Peters, who was acquired last week from the Rams, is the first player in NFL history to return an interception for a TD for two teams in one season. He had a 32-yard interception return for a score for Los Angeles in Week 4.\n\n___\n\nFRUSTRATED FALCONS\n\nAtlanta running back Devonta Freeman and Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald got into a fight in the third quarter of the Falcons\u2019 37-10 loss, leading to Freeman\u2019s ejection. The two locked up after Matt Ryan\u2019s pass off Mohamed Sanu\u2019s hands was intercepted by Cory Littleton deep in Atlanta territory with the Rams leading 20-3. Freeman had his hands on Donald\u2019s facemask before throwing a punch at the much bigger Donald, which appeared to make little if any contact. Umpire Terry Killens finally pulled Freeman away from Donald, taking Freeman to the ground in an apparent unintentional body slam before quickly helping Freeman to his feet. Each player drew unnecessary roughness penalties, and Freeman was tossed for throwing the punch.\n\n___\n\nREPLAY REVERSALS\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers thought they had scored the go-ahead touchdown not once but twice in the final 44 seconds at Tennessee, only to lose both on review by the replay official. That official also overturned Melvin Gordon being stopped on the Chargers\u2019 final play of Los Angeles\u2019 23-20 loss. First, Philip Rivers\u2019 pass that Austin Ekeler took 16 yards was ruled a touchdown only to be reversed for not breaking the plane as he was tackled by Kenny Vaccaro and Logan Ryan. After a false start, Malcolm Butler then was flagged for defensive pass interference on Mike Williams in the end zone. Then, Gordon went over right tackle with 34 seconds left for what officials ruled a 1-yard TD, and the replay official then reversed the call for the second time in what became a run for no gain. That set up Gordon\u2019s final run with 19 seconds left - and Jurrell Casey recovered a fumble after he was initially ruled down shy of the goal line at the 1.\n\n___\n\nFAMILIAR FACE\n\nEarl Thomas made his return to Seattle after nine seasons of playing for the Seahawks, getting five tackles in Baltimore\u2019s 30-16 victory. The star safety caught up with a handful of his former teammates before the game and signed a few of his Seahawks jerseys still floating around. He also exchanged jerseys with Russell Wilson after the game. Thomas was given the game ball after the victory.\n\n___\n\nSIDELINED\n\nAtlanta quarterback Matt Ryan injured his right ankle when he was sacked by the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Aaron Donald in the Falcons\u2019 37-10 loss. Ryan\u2019s right leg bent awkwardly as he was sacked by Donald and fumbled early in the fourth quarter. Coach Dan Quinn said he did not know the severity of Ryan\u2019s injury. Ryan wore a walking boot in the locker room and was not made available for his usual postgame news conference. \u2026 The Falcons also lost running back Ito Smith with head and neck injuries. \u2026 Houston cornerback Phillip Gaines was carted off the field late in a 30-23 loss at Indianapolis with what appeared to be a lower leg injury. Texans wide receiver Will Fuller left during Houston\u2019s first series with a hamstring injury and did not return, and safety Tashaun Gipson injured his back late in the first quarter. \u2026 Minnesota wide receiver Adam Thielen suffered a hamstring injury while scoring his seventh touchdown of the season in the Vikings\u2019 42-30 victory over Detroit. \u2026 Arizona running back David Johnson was limited to one carry by ankle and back issues in a 27-21 victory over the New York Giants.\n\n___\n\nSPEAKING\n\n\u201cA lot of times that ball leaves his hand, I\u2019m always like in awe. So, yeah, he\u2019s pretty good.\u201d - Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur on quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who threw for 429 yards and five touchdowns, and ran for another score in the Packers\u2019 42-24 rout of Oakland.\n\n___\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play against Michael Vick. I guess I\u2019m getting the new era with Lamar Jackson right there.\u201d - Seattle defensive end Jadeveon Clowney on the Baltimore quarterback who had 116 yards rushing and a TD, and 143 yards passing in the Ravens\u2019 30-16 win.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "SCOREBOARD", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/raiders_packers_football_06289_c0-185-4466-2790_s1200x700.jpg?90ddd9b06ce46c3eae2c8c3d29794e3513a166e5", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
