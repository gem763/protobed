That led to McCaffrey's dazzling 25-yard touchdown catch that featured him juking Vernon Hargreaves III and stiff-arming Devin White on his way into the end zone.\n\nIn between those two scores, McCaffrey capped a 99-yard drive with a 1-yard run on fourth down, giving him five TDs the past two weeks.\n\nThe Panthers took advantage of Tampa Bay's banged-up line that forced the Bucs to use backups Earl Watford and Josh Wells on the right side to harass Winston all day. They sacked him seven times, hit him to help force two of the interceptions and forced fumbles on successive plays late in the second quarter, including a strip sack by Vernon Butler that Irvin recovered.\n\nIt was part of a disturbing pattern for Winston throughout his career He has five games with at least four turnovers, while no other player has more than two of those games since Winston entered the league in 2015. Winston had five turnovers in all, giving him an NFL-worst 86 in the past five seasons.\n\nWinston did most of his damage after the game got out of hand late, throwing for 400 yards with a 10-yard TD pass to Cameron Brate in the fourth quarter that gave him 100 touchdown passes in his career.\n\nCurtis Samuel added two second-half TDs, scoring on an 8-yard end-around and a 13-yard pass from Kyle Allen.\n\nAllen finished 20 for 32 for 227 yards, two TDs and no interceptions to improve to 5-0 as a starter in his career.\n\nJUST FOR KICKS\n\nThere was a rare play at the end of the first half when the Panthers called for a fair catch at the 50 with 1 second left. Coach Ron Rivera opted to try a free kick for a field goal. Joey Slye got the opportunity to kick from the 50 with no rush as the Tampa Bay players were required to remain 10 yards back. The kick went wide right.\n\nREAL MCCOY\n\nPanthers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy had a big game against his former team. McCoy had 2\u00bd sacks, deflected a pass at the line of scrimmage and had one tackle for loss.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nCarolina defensive end Efe Obada was made an honorary captain for the game as part of an emotional day for him. The Nigerian native arrived in England as a 10-year-old after being trafficked with his sister from the Netherlands. Now he's back here as an NFL player and a star attraction after first picking up the sport of American football at age 22.\n\nINJURIES\n\nPanthers: Starting CB Donte Jackson missed his third straight game with a groin injury.\n\nBuccaneers: Safety Jordan Whitehead went down with an apparent shoulder injury in the fourth quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPanthers: Carolina gets a week off before heading to San Francisco on Oct. 27 to face the 49ers.\n\nBuccaneers: Tampa Bay gets a brief respite in its five-game stretch away from home with a bye week before traveling to Tennessee for the fourth game in this stretch on Oct. 27.", "description": "Jameis Winston threw five interceptions and lost a fumble as the Buccaneers couldn't keep up with the Panthers in London.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/13/USAT/cdd374db-9d33-46f6-9e87-c5f7fe73b75b-AP_Panthers_Buccaneers_Football_1.jpg?crop=3382,1902,x1,y9&width=2852&height=1902&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
