USA TODAY\n\nIt\u2019s raining Will Smiths in \u201cGemini Man,\u201d though double the A-lister means twice the disappointment.\n\nSmith plays a middle-aged government assassin and \u2013 thanks to snazzy performance-capture technology \u2013 his 23-year-old killer clone in Oscar-winning director Ang Lee's sci-fi action thriller (\u2605\u2605 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters nationwide Friday). The movie shoots for the moon with an intriguing dual-role conceit but wildly misses the mark. Hackneyed dialogue, a thin and silly plot fumbling the ambition of the concept, and a mixed bag of visual effects all leave this one just for the Smith completists.\n\nHenry Brogan (Smith) is a lethal legend known for doing hit jobs no one else can. His latest mission leads to him questioning if his mind and body are still fit enough, however, and he decides to retire. That\u2019s when his former bosses \u2013 including villainous superior Clay Verris (Clive Owen), who heads up black-ops science outfit GEMINI \u2013 mark Henry for death.\n\nRanked: The best (and worst) Will Smith movies\n\nWill Smith: Why he won't watch wife Jada's 'Red Table Talk'\n\nJunior (Will Smith, left) comes to grips with the fact that he's a clone of Henry Brogan (also Smith) in \"Gemini Man.\" (Photo: PARAMOUNT PICTURES)\n\nThis is a skilled guy with decades of experience murdering folks, so Henry\u2019s hard to kill. With the help of Danny (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a fellow agent sent to keep an eye on him, and old friend Baron (Benedict Wong), he escapes his Georgia home and goes international to stay safe. Verris then sends in his secret weapon: Junior, a physically superior, exact replica of Henry who knows all the old man\u2019s moves though doesn't possess his wiles.\n\nSmith at least does his part with the Herculean task of playing the same dude three decades apart, with an old soul as Henry and a troubled one as Junior. The technology is key to pulling off this interesting two-hander and in some of the younger man\u2019s sequences, Lee captures Smith\u2019s eyes and persona so well, it\u2019s like you\u2019re seeing the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air all over again.\n\nThe effects can be great but also off-putting when they don\u2019t quite jibe with everything else happening onscreen \u2013 which happens too often. Junior looks uncannily like Smith in one scene and then like somebody totally different the next. And in a few instances, Junior is way too obviously a digital character, the kiss of death in a movie like this.\n\nClay Verris (Clive Owen, left) has big plans for Junior (Will Smith) in \"Gemini Man.\" (Photo: PARAMOUNT PICTURES)\n\nAt least the high-tech stuff leans innovative, because pretty much everything else is rather unimaginative.\n\nThe fight scenes between Henry and Junior are scattershot and overall the action is too far-fetched, even considering the \"clones among us\" business. Character motivations are all over the map, the bad guys (especially Owen) are just bad, there\u2019s tonal whiplash aplenty (deeply serious one minute, jokey the next) and those who love action movies have seen every beat of \u201cGemini Man\u201d already and can see the surprises coming. On a positive note, Smith and Wong are a great pairing and can sling zingers back and forth with ease, so get them a buddy action comedy ASAP.\n\nThis is the second lackluster outing in a row for Lee following 2016's \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk,\u201d though at least \u201cGemini Man\u201d near the end delves into the sort of emotional undercurrent that lifted his gems like \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi.\u201d The movie ponders the humanity of a clone \u2013 is it a real person or a disposable copy? \u2013 as well as the fear of really looking at yourself, who you are and what you\u2019ve done in your life, not metaphorically with a mirror but quite literally.\n\nThat all comes a smidge too late in an otherwise uninspired effort. And unfortunately, two Wills don\u2019t make it right.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/10/review-will-smith-gemini-man-doubles-your-disappointment/3916136002/", "description": "Will Smith plays a middle-aged assassin and his 23-year-old clone, but his personal appeal and snazzy tech can't save Ang Lee's thriller 'Gemini Man.'", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
