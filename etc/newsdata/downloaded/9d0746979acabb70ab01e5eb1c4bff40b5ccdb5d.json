EEOC and two other cases involving LGBT employment issues seem to indicate that we\u2019re heading toward yet another set of close decisions split along partisan lines. If you\u2019ve been following our ongoing coverage of the case here, you\u2019re already aware that the dispute in Harris involves a funeral director named Aimee Stephens who was fired after announcing that he was transgender and planned to begin living and dressing as a woman on the job. Two other cases deal with gay workers who were allegedly fired from their jobs after coming out.\n\nSome of the questions and comments from the justices are particularly telling. Some details are provided by The Guardian. (Emphasis added)\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, a possible swing vote, wondered about the implications of what he described as an expansion of the job-discrimination law. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be expanding the definition of what \u2018sex\u2019 covers, what do we do about that issue?\u201d Roberts asked. Samuel Alito, a conservative, suggested the high court would be usurping the role of Congress by reading protection for sexual orientation into the 1964 Civil Rights Act, when lawmakers at the time likely envisioned they were doing no such thing. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to change the meaning of \u2018sex,\u201d\u2019 he said.\n\nThe liberal wing of the court seemed to take a decidedly different tone. Elena Kagan stated that \u201ca man who loves other men cannot be treated differently by an employer than a woman who loves men.\u201d\n\nWe already know that Chief Justice John Roberts is frustrated at the number of cases that are decided in a 5-4 split and the public perception that his court is a politically charged beast. He\u2019s broken ranks with the other, more conservative justices before and could well wind up being the swing vote in these cases yet again. But at a minimum, he\u2019s at least raising doubts about some of the issues in play here.\n\nOne problem we\u2019re running into is the trend of conflating issues of gay rights with transgender rights. For example, one of the other cases, Altitude Express v. Zarda, has nothing to do with transgender issues. Donald Zarda is a gay skydiving instructor who was fired from his job under complicated conditions. He had a habit of telling female clients about his sexual orientation so they would feel more comfortable being strapped closely together during tandem jumps. But one female customer complained after the jump that he had touched her inappropriately and was trying to use his sexual orientation to cover it up.\n\nZarda denied any inappropriate contact and claimed he was fired simply for being openly gay. Obviously, if the woman\u2019s story is true he should have been terminated. If Zarda is telling the truth that would be a terrible thing for the employer to do. But Title 7 doesn\u2019t cover employment protection based on sexual orientation unless the court determines that the word \u201csex\u201d includes sexual orientation.\n\nThat\u2019s very different than the Harris case. In that one, as Alito pointed out, the plaintiffs aren\u2019t trying to \u201cexpand\u201d the definition of sex but to radically alter it entirely. If the court is willing to conflate sex with whatever \u201cgender\u201d a person claims they associate with, then the entire meaning of both words goes out the window. And that will be a tragic blow to actual women in any number of areas, particularly in competitive sports.\n\nBut as I\u2019ve written before, I have a suspicion that the court will try to dodge those larger issues in Harris and deliver a far more narrowly tailored decision focusing on workplace dress codes.", "description": "Things are heating up at the Supreme Court", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Alito.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
