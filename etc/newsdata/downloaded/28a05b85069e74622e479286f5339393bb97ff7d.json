We know those are the rules, so yes. You\u2019d be foolish if you hadn\u2019t prepared for it.\n\n\u201cBut I would be highly surprised if after 80 minutes, then 10 minutes each way, then sudden-death extra-time - by which time there\u2019ll be bugger all people standing - that someone hasn\u2019t scored some points.\n\n\u201cBut funnier things have happened, eh?\u201d\n\nFunnier things did happen earlier this year in another World Cup match between New Zealand and England.\n\nWith the scores tied after the regular 50 overs and then sudden-death super over, New Zealand\u2019s cricketers lost the final to England in July 14 on a count back of boundaries hit during the game and Hansen was not impressed with the ending.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they got the cricket one right really,\u201d he said with a wry grin.\n\nWhile the responsibility of the kick-off is likely to fall to the backs, lock Scott Barrett, whose brothers Beauden and Jordie are regular goal kickers in the team, also backed himself if called upon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019d be a few backs first,\u201d said Barrett, who added he was sharing a room with Beauden this week for the first time since 2002. \u201cWe\u2019d have to be quite short.\n\n\u201c(But) out of the forwards, I\u2019d definitely back myself.\u201d", "description": "All Blacks coach Steve Hansen is leaving nothing to chance in his Rugby World Cup semi-final against England, even the unlikely possibility of a kicking contest to decide the game.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443667662&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0Q8", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
