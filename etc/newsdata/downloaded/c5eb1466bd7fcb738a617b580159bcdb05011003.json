Seventeen years ago, Blair was king: fresh from a second landslide victory, all-powerful and on a mission\u2014six months before ensnaring himself in Iraq.\n\nThe Blair and Clinton rule book was simple. Successful political leaders were a sacrifice party activists had to endure for their side to win power. Real leaders defined themselves against their party\u2019s instincts and used conferences like the one in Blackpool to talk not to their base, but to the country at large. Politics was a consumer industry, and political parties were businesses, not charitable cooperatives run by the workers.\n\nFor the first time since I started attending these strangely British political jamborees, the rules of the game as laid out by Blair have been entirely junked. Britain\u2019s political leaders are now tribunes of the party base, amplifying their demands, not challenging them. Jeremy Corbyn has played this role ever since ascending to the Labour throne in 2015. He is the activists\u2019 hero, defining himself against Labour\u2019s members of Parliament, not the party\u2019s base.\n\nRead: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Britain would reshape Western alliances\n\nWhat is unique about 2019 is that this now applies to both main political leaders. In Manchester, Boris Johnson has been cheered everywhere as the conquering Tory hero, a kind of Brexit Corbyn. After the drab, depressing years of Theresa May and the insults toward the party from David Cameron, here is a true Tory. The \u201cmad, swivel-eyed loons\u201d are now doing things their way. Enough of the sacrifice.\n\nThe break with the recent past signals a fundamental shift in British politics following the 2016 Brexit referendum. Gone are the attempts to establish a compromise position acceptable to the center. In the Brexit civil war, there is no \u201cthird way\u201d between Remain and Leave\u2014you must choose a side.\n\nRead: It\u2019s too late for David Cameron to apologize\n\nIn Blair\u2019s Britain, political leaders were modern, centrist, progressive. He had taken on the left in his party and won, symbolically stripping out the old \u201cclause four\u201d of the party\u2019s constitution that promised to socialize the economy and replacing it with mushy aspiration. After being elected prime minister, he promised not to turn back left, vowing that he had campaigned as \u201cNew Labour\u201d and would govern as New Labour. His failure to challenge the Thatcherite economic consensus is held against him by the left. To be called a Blairite within Labour today is a pejorative.\n\nAfter Blair, Gordon Brown came and went, unsure whether to distance himself from his predecessor or copy him, speaking of Real Labour (not New Labour) one minute, only to invite Margaret Thatcher to 10 Downing Street the next. Cameron, the heir to Blair, soon saw him off, selling the Conservative Party with a familiar image\u2014a modern man challenging his party.", "description": "Now they amplify, rather than challenge, their base.", "authors": ["Tom Mctague"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTRBI6K-1/facebook.jpg?1570042573"}
