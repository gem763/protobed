There were no reports of serious injuries.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Fire Chief Brad Goodroad said at an early morning news conference Wednesday that at least 37 structures collapsed or had structural issues. KELO said many trees and street lights were down.\n\nThe National Weather Service lead meteorologist in Sioux Falls, Todd Heitkamp, told the AP a survey would be conducted in daylight to confirm it was a tornado that caused the damage. Heitkamp added that most of it was probably the result of strong straight-line winds.\n\nAccess to the Avera Heart Hospital was blocked except for doctors, nurses and ambulances. They had to drive through debris to get there, KELO said. The hospital sustained significant damage and some people were hurt. Officials were trying to relocate some patients.\n\nThe storm prompted police to issue a No Travel advisory in the city, which opened an emergency operations center to coordinate the response to the storm.\n\nAs of 2:15 a.m. EDT, Xcel Energy's power outage map showed around 20,000 homes and businesses in the dark in the Sioux Falls area. That number was reduced to 8,000 several hours later.\n\nKELO sent out numerous crews to chronicle the storm's aftermath.
