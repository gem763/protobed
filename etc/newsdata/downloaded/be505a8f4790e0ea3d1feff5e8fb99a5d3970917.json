The Japanese government itself would pay nothing under the proposal so it can stick to its position that all reparations were settled by a lump sum payment in 1965.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the Korean government will accept.\n\nBut the fact that the Japanese government made the proposal at all suggests that the two sides are looking for ways to settle their conflict and save face.\n\nThe Korean Foreign Ministry officially denied the report.\n\n\"Our government respects the court decision\" that Japanese firms have to compensate forced labor victims, a ministry spokesman said. But he added it \"has an open mind about seeking a rational solution that the victims and the peoples of the two countries can accept. Based on this position, we're continuing to communicate with Japanese Foreign Ministry officials.\"", "description": "Korea, Japan 'Mulling Economic Cooperation Fund'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
