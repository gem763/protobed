The cows, which fetch a price of around $1,200, were killed and homes were damaged. No humans were reportedly harmed in the incident.\n\nVehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) have been widely utilised amongst terrorist organisations for suicide missions, in addition to animals. In 2013, a suicide bomber with a donkey killed three NATO troops in Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nA report of the incident comes amid a scathing assessment from the Defense Department's inspector general warning that ISIS could be resurfacing in light of the US's decision to withdraw its troops from Syria.\n\n\"ISIS remains a threat in Iraq and Syria,\" lead inspector general Glenn Fine wrote in the report. \"This quarter, ISIS continued its transition from a territory - holding force to an insurgency in Syria, and it intensified its insurgency in Iraq.\"\n\nDespite the government report's findings in June, President Donald Trump previously declared ISIS lost \"100%\" of its territory in Syria.\n\nAlthough estimates vary, around 14,000 to 18,000 ISIS members are still believed to be operating, according to public data cited in the inspector general's report. The figures include up to 3,000 foreigners.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "A suicide bomber with a donkey killed three NATO troops in Afghanistan in 2013.
