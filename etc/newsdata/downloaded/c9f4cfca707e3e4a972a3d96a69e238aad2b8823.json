who was with Kok when he was murdered - and two others are currently wanted by police in connection with multiple offences.\n\nAn appeal from Police Scotland they said all five men are wanted by detectives from Operation Escalade, the investigation into one of the country's top-tier serious organised crime groups.\n\nDetective Superintendent Stephen Grant said: 'Operation Escalade is an ongoing investigation into one of the country's top-tier serious organised crime groups.\n\n'We are appealing to the public to come forward with any information they may have regarding the whereabouts of these named individuals who are wanted in connection with a number of serious offences.'\n\nDutch investigators think Kok's assassination is linked to the Escalade group, which is run by 'The Brothers.'\n\nThe group is thought to have been 'the most sophisticated' encountered by police in Scotland and were involved in drug smuggling, abduction and torture.\n\nIn December 2017 prosecutors revealed their dealings in drugs, firearms, violence and dirty money.\n\nThe list of crimes included the horrific abduction and torture of a man over an unpaid cocaine debt.\n\nThis is the terrifying hoard of deadly weapons seized from a 'sophisticated' criminal gang thought to be one of the most dangerous ever encountered by police in Scotland\n\nThere was also a shooting at the family home of a gangland figure as well as a massive arsenal of weapons found hidden in a car.\n\nDavid Sell, 50, Barry O'Neill, 37, Anthony Woods, 44, Francis Mulligan, 41, Michael Bowman, 30, Mark Richardson, 30, Gerard Docherty, 42, Steven McArdle, 33 and Martyn Fitzsimmons, 37, all pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nThe High Court in Glasgow, also heard the group used 'counter surveillance and anti surveillance tactics'.\n\nThis included specialist 'signal jammers' and 'distinctive encrypted' mobile phones to communicate.\n\n'The Brothers' previously bought the encrypted phones from other companies, but for security reasons decided to make their own devices which they could then hand out to associates.\n\nThis meant their criminality was secure, and they could even make some additional cash by selling the devices.\n\nThe company is currently closed, but they are still wanted by Police Scotland and may even be using encrypted devices to communicate with family members of friends.\n\nA DEA spokesperson told VICE: 'We can confirm that MPC is part of an ongoing investigation, but cannot comment further due to that ongoing investigation.'", "description": "Martin Kok, 49, had been convicted and had served his sentence for two murders in his native Netherlands and since his release had focused on writing about the criminal underworld.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton", "Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20087148-0-image-a-46_1571841303764.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
