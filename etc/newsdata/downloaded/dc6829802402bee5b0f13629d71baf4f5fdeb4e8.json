Remove tea bags and pour the tea into a big pot into which the pork leg will fit.\n\nUsing a sharp knife, (or ask your butcher to do this) remove the skin from the pork leg, trying to keep the skin in one piece. Place the skin (open) in the fridge to dry out.\n\nPlace the pork leg in the pot with the tea and add all the other ingredients except the corn flour and soy sauce.\n\nHeat the pot until the liquid is simmering, place the lid on and simmer for at least 3 hours or until the leg is almost completely soft (it will depend on the size of the leg). Add water when the liquid in the pot has cooked away until there\u2019s very little left.\n\nPreheat oven to 180\u00b0C.\n\nRemove the leg (in one piece) from the cooking liquid and place into the oven dish. Place the skin back onto the meat and tie up with string. Pat the skin dry with kitchen paper and rub with salt.\n\nPlace in oven and roast for another 1 \u2013 2 hours and until the skin on top is golden and crisp. Put aside to rest for at least 10 minutes.\n\nPour the cooking liquid into a saucepan and simmer without a lid until it is reduced to half or just enough to make a suitable gravy. Mix the corn flour with a little water to a paste, and add to the cooking liquid, together with the soy sauce. Taste the gravy, season again with salt and pepper and serve with the roast leg of pork.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://heritage.24.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/heritage-logo-100x100.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
