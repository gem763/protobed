But he had acted not out of anger, but because she frequently asked to be spanked.ENDNEW\n\nCanadian man held hostage by Taliban denies assaulting wife after release Read more\n\nBoyle and Coleman, who married in 2011, were kidnapped by Afghan militants during a backpacking trip in 2012 and were transferred to the custody of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network.\n\nBoyle has pleaded not guilty to assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement betweenOctober and December 2017, after the couple returned to Ottawa.\n\nSince taking the stand last week, Boyle, 36 has worked to counter the prosecution\u2019s depiction that he was a manipulative and abusive husband.\n\nTaliban hostage couple face each other in Canada courtroom Read more\n\nHe is also accused of administering a noxious substance.\n\nOn Tuesday, he disputed accusations that he drugged Coleman with the anti-depressant trazadone, instead testifying he had offered her the drug because she was prone to \u201cfits\u201d.\n\nHygiene routines \u2013 in disarray after five years in captivity \u2013 were a point of friction between him and Coleman, he said.\n\nHe told the court that on 5 November \u2013 about a month after they were rescued by Pakistan security forces \u2013 Coleman flew into a rage when he suggested that she took a shower before meeting his parents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember if I invoked the fact both my mother and father had complained about Caitlan\u2019s hygiene,\u201d said Boyle. \u201cMeeting in public was often embarrassing for them.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, Boyle accused Coleman of \u201cincompetence\u201d as a mother, saying that while in captivity, Coleman would \u201cshut down\u201d, neglecting to feed their newborn or change diapers, prompting him to ask guards for food for the child.\n\nEven after the family was rescued in 2017 and brought to Canada, Boyle claimed Coleman would strike and violently shake their oldest child in their family\u2019s Ottawa apartment.\n\nIn previous testimony from March and April, Coleman claimed Boyle was mercurial and violent, choking, punching and biting her. In addition to cataloguing numerous instances of sexual assault, she also alleged Boyle threatened to kill her \u2013 in front of their children.\n\nBut during-cross examination, Boyle dismissed the accusation that he was manipulative in their relationship, suggesting Coleman\u2019s behaviour and accusations could be attributed to mental illness. He also claimed that his demands that Coleman maintain a certain weight and dress in a specific manner were merely \u201csuggestions\u201d that she could have freely disregarded.\n\nThe trial, which began in March, has been marred by numerous procedural delays over what material \u2013 including Coleman\u2019s past sexual history \u2013 is admissible in court.\n\nThe proceedings also came to a standstill in July after Coleman gave several interviews to media outlets about her time in captivity, despite an order from the judge not to discuss the case.\n\nThe defence will question Boyle on Wednesday, with closing arguments from both sides scheduled for the end of September.", "description": "Joshua Boyle, charged with sexual assault, tells court estranged wife Caitlan Coleman was unfit to parent their four children", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91567b24422f1a3343ea60cfd19bf6389234a04a/0_73_4388_2634/master/4388.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=096a5dbdeff7af83a6cf35d953257719", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
