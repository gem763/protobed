More partners can help to increase mainstream demand for the type of materials needed.\n\nFor Carlsberg, the innovation is aimed at reducing the company's impact on the environment.\n\nMyriam Shingleton, vice president of group development for Carlsberg, said that fiber bottles were more environmentally friendly than aluminum or glass because the material has 'very low impact on production process.'\n\nShe said that the 'energy and efficiency' of the technology used reduces carbon emissions compared to other production processes.\n\nThe prototypes are part of the company's efforts to have zero-carbon emissions at its breweries and reduce by 30% the carbon footprint across its value chain by 2030\n\nMyriam Shingleton, vice president of group development for Carlsberg, said that fiber bottles were more environmentally friendly than aluminum or glass because the material has 'very low impact on production process'\n\nShingleton acknowledged the bottles are a few years away from completion at present, saying: 'While we are not completely there yet, the two prototypes are an important step towards realising our ultimate ambition of bringing this breakthrough to market.\n\n'Innovation takes time and we will continue to collaborate with leading experts in order to overcome remaining technical challenges.'\n\nThe announcement comes after Coca Cola said last month it would stop using plastic shrink-wrap across all multipacks of cans sold in supermarkets.\n\nMore than 30million packs across all Coke brands including Fanta, Sprite, Dr Pepper and Lilt, are to move to cardboard over the next 18 months.\n\nThe move is part of the Coca Cola's effort to cut the use of 'virgin plastic' which will see 4,000 tons removed from its product line-up across western Europe.", "description": "Danish brewer Carlsberg has announced plans to develop a paper beer bottle made from sustainably-sourced wood fibres.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19591406-0-image-a-80_1570802144065.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
