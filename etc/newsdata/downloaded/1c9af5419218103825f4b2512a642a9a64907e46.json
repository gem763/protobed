It seemed he was the answer to all the ills of British boxing.\n\nHandsome and talented, he fought with flair and confidence. Perhaps a touch too light to perform with the giants of the heavyweight scene, he had the charm and the style to make his mark. Not since Lennox Lewis did the British fight scene have a talisman.\n\n\n\nSo how has it come to this?\n\n\n\nHead to head: David Haye (left) and Dereck Chisora meet at Upton Park\n\nDAVID HAYE'S DOWNFALL\n\nClick here for Sportsmail's picture special on the career of the Hayemaker\n\nOn Saturday at Upton Park, Haye will climb from the floor to take on Dereck Chisora in a fight the British Boxing Board of Control has refused to sanction. Both are unlicensed by the BBBC. Both need each other.\n\n\n\nIt will attract a good attendance to east London \u2014 and a decent pay day \u2014 but this is not the way it should be. Not for Haye. He should be better than this.\n\n\n\nThe old fight game has to be about control and discipline but the origin of this fight stems from a lack of both from each fighter.\n\n\n\nI remember all-British fights when they meant something more. Tony Sibson v Alan Minter, the fights involving Chris Eubank, Nigel Benn, Michael Watson and Steve Collins. Lennox Lewis against Frank Bruno, John Conteh and Chris Finnegan, Naseem Hamed and Steve Robinson, who had earlier fought my brother Duke.\n\n\n\nGlory days: British stars Chris Eubank (right) and Nigel Benn\n\nWhen I fought Terry Marsh in 1984, I was impatient for a world-title shot, but took on my best British rival instead, even though I was warned it was dangerous. I lost, but recognised what it meant to the British public to have these occasions.\n\n\n\nMore recently, James DeGale and George Groves was a domestic fight to cherish. But not this one, not tonight.\n\n\n\nI will watch out of curiosity, but I will have no pride. It\u2019s not a good night for boxing.", "description": "In 2010, David Haye was heralded as the \u2018Lord of the Ring\u2019 by Sky Sports.
