Tart with strong citrus notes and a touch of sweetness; it may be small in stature but packs a punch, flavour wise. by: Andrea Fedder | 30 Sep 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re already bored of a\u00e7ai berries in your smoothie bowl and gojis in your granola, then it\u2019s time you met the sea buckthorn berry \u2013 the latest superfood golden child to enter the culinary and beauty scenes. And it\u2019s quite literally a golden child. The tiny berries have a deep orange skin and a bright citrusy, pulpy flesh.\n\nWhere did this guy turn up?\n\nThe sea buckthorn berry grows mostly in the cooler climates of Northern Europe, Asia and parts of Canada. Not one to be too demanding about its environment, this hardy shrub quite happily makes its home on sandy slopes, even tolerating salty sea breezes. It was even used on the dunes of the East Lothian coast of Scotland as a hardy windbreaker. The bushes bloom with small yellow flowers in spring and ripen with hundreds of tiny (think 6 to 9mm) berries in the Northern Autumn seasons from August to December.\n\nKnown as \u2018the lemon of the north\u2019, the sea buckthorn berry\u2019s flavour is said to be rather tart and citrusy, with a delicate sweetness once your palate becomes familiar with its profile. But eating them raw can be too tangy and, to some, unpalatable. So, it\u2019s definitely the kind of berry you give to your toddler and film for your Insta-stories.\n\nTiny but mighty\n\nThis superfood may be tiny in size, but packs a mighty punch \u2013 in more ways than one.\n\nHarvesting them is an interesting process. As the name warns you, the berries cluster around long, protruding thorns. These thorns are so daunting that the best harvesting practice is actually to let the branches freeze and then to shake the berries off to avoid unwanted body piercings. All this rigmarole means they can easily cost you around R230 for about 450g.\n\nBut they do offer a powerhouse of desirable nutrients:\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Crazy amounts of Vitamin C \u2013 about 9 to 12 times that of oranges.\n\n\u00b7 B12 \u2013 this one\u2019s a biggie, as it\u2019s most commonly found in animal products, so you can imagine how excited the vegans and vegetarians are.\n\n\u00b7 Omega \u2013 not just one of them, but one of the only known plants to contain all four (if you know your healthy oils, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a great stimulator of collagen production).\n\nFun fact: sea buckthorn products were used in the diet of Soviet astronauts, according to Berries for Africa.\n\nNow how do I use sea buckthorn?\n\nThink of sea buckthorn as a cross between a gooseberry and a granadilla in terms of foodie applications. Chefs from Michelin-starred restaurants chefs across America and Europe are raving about this berry\u2019s versatility as being akin to that of an apple because of the many varieties available \u2013 over 20 \u2013 ranging in acidity from barely anything to practically mouth-puckering.\n\nHere are just some of the ways you could use sea buckthorn in your cooking:\n\n(should you be able to get hold of it on our shores)\n\n\u00b7 Make a tangy jam.\n\n\u00b7 Use instead of vinegar in a more citrusy salad dressing.\n\n\u00b7 As a tart au jus for savoury dishes, or coulis for desserts (think ice cream or fruit salad).\n\n\u00b7 Make a chutney of sorts for curries.\n\n\u00b7 Make juice or a juicy cocktail (a la Prairie Chef, Anthony Strong\u2019s Becky With The Good Hair \u2013 inspired by Beyonc\u00e9).\n\n\u00b7 Whip up a bright orange mousse or sea buckthorn ice-cream.\n\n\u00b7 Of course, the freeze-dried powder can be added to smoothies too.\n\nUntil the berries become more available on our shores, you can indulge in the beauty benefits instead and enjoy the facial oil available from online wellness stores.\n\nALSO SEE: Superfood savvy: 5 healthy ingredients you should be making friends with", "description": "'The lemon of the north' - a seabuck thorn berry is the latest berry to make it to the superfood list.
