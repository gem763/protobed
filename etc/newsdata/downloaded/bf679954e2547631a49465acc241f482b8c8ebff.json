Turn a 360-Pound Rugby Player Into a Football Star?", "language": "en", "text": "The IMG coaches envisioned him as an offensive tackle, a blocker who clears lanes for running backs and, more important, protects high-priced quarterbacks. His wingspan alone (35\u00bd-inch arms) promised to make him hard to get around. His performance in the tests given to offensive linemen \u2014 the 40-yard dash, shuttle runs and various agility drills that measure an athlete\u2019s stamina, balance and ability to change direction \u2014 put him in the top ranks of the N.F.L.\u2019s offensive-tackle prospects in recent seasons. His body fat was below 20 percent, exceedingly low for a man his size. \u201cIn my years of coaching, I probably haven\u2019t had anybody who looks like that, top to bottom,\u201d Jay Butler, a former N.F.L. strength and conditioning coach who worked with Mailata at IMG, told ESPN.\n\nOffensive tackle, though, is one of the most technically demanding positions in football. It requires size, complicated footwork, a high degree of intelligence and, usually, the acquired wisdom \u2014 gained over years of high school and college competition \u2014 needed to win the battles against defensive players who come charging across the line of scrimmage. One mistake can cost a team a game \u2014 or a season, if the error results in a $30-million-a-year quarterback\u2019s leaving the field on an injury cart.\n\nAs Stoutland, who is the Eagles\u2019 offensive line coach, watched Mailata go through drills \u2014 mainly simulations of pass blocking and run blocking \u2014 his skepticism evaporated. \u201cRight away, I was like, Hello!\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou better pay close attention here.\u201d He was standing next to a scout for the Pittsburgh Steelers. \u201cWe were both looking at each other, like, Holy cow, what are we seeing here?\u201d\n\nLess than two years later, Jordan Mailata has just begun his second season as an N.F.L. player, following a year in which an ESPN writer named him the Eagles\u2019 \u201cmost improved rookie\u201d \u2014 a highly unusual honor, considering that he never set foot on the field last year in a regular-season game. But his performance during the 2018 preseason had turned some former offensive linemen into cheerleaders. \u201cBorderline obsessed with this dude at this point. This is crazy,\u201d Ross Tucker, a broadcaster and former N.F.L. lineman, tweeted while also projecting Mailata as a future All-Pro. Mailata had pass-blocked competently and used his strength to clear big corridors for running backs; it was not the man-versus-boys stuff of the rugby video, but for a pure novice, it was impressive. His progress in practices was said to be remarkable (hence the \u201cmost improved\u201d accolade). The buzz raised expectations and, if anything, increased the pressure on Mailata. Is he really a future star or just a curiosity piece? How soon until he is trusted to play in a game that counts? More broadly, how much football can you cram into an athlete, even one as big and outlandishly gifted as Mailata, if he has never played the sport before?\n\nThe 2018 N.F.L. draft took place in April, less than four months after Mailata arrived in Florida to begin his football education. The Eagles actually made a trade in order to move up in the seventh round and select him before the Steelers could. When his name was called, he walked out onto the stage at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., wearing a white untucked shirt and a pair of jeans, along with a beige bomber jacket purchased from Johnny Bigg, an Australian men\u2019s wear store that features garments in sizes XL to 9XL. (Many of the top college players dress for the draft in expensive bespoke outfits.) The commentators on the N.F.L. Network went into near hysterics when his name was called. \u201cYou\u2019re about to see absolutely no footage of him playing American football,\u201d one said. They showed the rugby video, and when Mailata steamrollered an opponent and sent him staggering backward, another commentator cackled, \u201cGet some, little fella!\u201d", "description": "Jordan Mailata had never played football before the Eagles drafted him last year.
