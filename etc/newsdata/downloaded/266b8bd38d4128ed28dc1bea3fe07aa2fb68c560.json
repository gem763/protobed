It reportedly includes over 40 recommendations to increase attendee safety at festivals, like reducing the numbers of police on-site, scrapping sniffer dogs, and, crucially, permitting pill testing operations.\n\nDespite those apparent findings, the Berejiklian government remains steadfast in its opposition to pill testing.\n\nInstead, Berejiklian and her party seem content in rallying around telling the public there is no safe way to take an illicit drug. The premier said just as much on \u2018Sunrise\u2019 on Wednesday morning:\n\n\"There is no safe way to take an illicit drug\" NSW Premier @GladysB will ignore the Coroner's leaked recommendations, insisting her staunch opposition to illegal drug taking will not change.

The inquest into deaths at music festivals has involved multiple families coming forward with their experiences, as well as medical bodies and representatives. Police have remained in solidarity with the NSW government, despite voices like former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Palmer claiming the nation\u2019s drug policies are failing.\n\nUnfortunately for Berejiklian, Just Say No doesn\u2019t work. It never has. The mantra of abstinence has been a constant in conservative governments over the decades, and that extends to drugs, regardless of the proven efficacy of that position.\n\nMany may have been frustrated by the Liberal government\u2019s initial refusal to respect the thoughts and wishes of almost every medical body in the country when they called for pill testing trials, but they should not be surprised by the premier choosing to disregard the State Coroner. If the draft report from Harriet Grahame is accurate, she is just another expert raising her hand high and tall.\n\nExperts in the field have told both the NSW government and the general public multiple times that pill testing never tells a punter their pill is \u201csafe.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Just About Every Major Health Body In The Country Now Backs Pill Testing\n\nThe implication is that very little will change until the NSW Liberal Party and Gladys Berejiklian believe backing pill testing will result in a positive, or at least neutral, reaction from voters.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that lies as much with Berejiklian as it does the hundreds of thousands of NSW voters who frame the decisions she makes. The problem is that Berejiklian continuing to promote abstinence from drugs as a platform to voters ignores what we know about the lives of young people, and if the leaked coroner\u2019s report is to be believed, her standpoint could impede measures experts believe could save lives.\n\nThe current solution to this problem looks to be re-instating a festival licensing scheme which will probably just result in less music festivals, and a bill to be introduced on Wednesday aims to bring back regulations for festivals deemed \u201chigh risk\u201d. Those festivals will be forced to pay for a licence, plus an emergency service presence, without any pill testing protocols. It\u2019s regulation that an upper house inquiry already recommended scrapping after declaring it resulted in excessive price hikes and uncertainty.\n\nIf you can\u2019t fix the result, fix the cause.
