(Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSenior administration officials, including Housing Secretary Ben Carson, plan to visit Los Angeles in the coming days as part of President Trump\u2019s push to crack down on homelessness in California, according to three people briefed on the plans.\n\nThe trip brings into sharp focus the Trump administration\u2019s tightly held effort to spotlight and intervene in California\u2019s growing homeless population. White House officials have not fully disclosed to local leaders the extent of their discussions, which have included probing the legality of razing tent camps and relocating large groups of homeless people.\n\nTrump officials have expressed an extreme interest in the surge in the homeless population in the \u201cskid row\u201d area of Los Angeles. Trump has sought to blame Democrats for not doing enough to address the issue.\n\nCarson\u2019s visit could come as soon as next week and coincide with Trump\u2019s trip to California, where the president will hold fundraisers. The planning remains in flux, and White House officials have been known to cancel visits at the last minute. But in a sign of how advanced discussions had become, other Trump administration officials this week secretly toured an abandoned Federal Aviation Administration facility in Hawthorne, roughly 20 miles southwest of \u201cskid row.\u201d Administration officials have discussed re-purposing the site into a homeless shelter.\n\nTrump has become particularly animated about the issue, complaining that years of failed policies by Democrats has fueled the crisis, and the issue is frequently covered by the conservative media. A senior White House aide said Trump had considered holding an event on homelessness during his California trip, but that is now unlikely to happen.\n\nThe people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal the internal planning discussions.\n\nTrump has ordered aides to figure out a sweeping plan to address staggering increases in homelessness in Los Angeles and other cities, particularly in California. One option being considered is relocating homeless people from \u201cskid row\u201d to the unused FAA facility in Hawthorne, government officials have told the Post.\n\nOne government official involved in the planning questioned the feasibility and legality of the relocation plan.\n\n\u201cIt is the stupidest idea I have ever heard,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional repercussions.\n\nA Department of Housing and Urban Development spokesman would not confirm Carson\u2019s travel to California or reveal additional details about the administration\u2019s homeless plan or potential use of the FAA site.\n\n\"While there are many state and local issues at play here, we\u2019re looking at a range of options available to us at HUD \u2013 as well as other agencies \u2013 for possible federal action, if and where appropriate,\u201d said a senior agency official who characterized the spike in homelessness in Los Angeles and San Francisco as \u201calarming.\u201d\n\nCarson made his first visit to \u201cskid row\u201d last April, an experience he had said \"you cannot forget.\u201d\n\nCarson on Wednesday told FOX Business Network\u2019s Varney & Co. that the administration was actively working on solutions to California\u2019s homeless crisis, both to \u201ctake care of the acute phase and the more long term phase.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get out ahead of the plan,\" Carson said.\n\nThe Washington Post reported this week that the administration is considering razing tent camps, creating new temporary facilities or refurbishing government facilities as part of Trump\u2019s directive on homelessness. The number of families either sleeping on the streets or lacking adequate housing has jumped for most major California cities, climbing at least 25 percent over the past several years, according to David Garcia, policy director at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nThe extent of the administration\u2019s interest in the Hawthorne facility was not immediately known. One Hawthorne FAA facility was vacated about 14 months ago and turned back over to the U.S. General Services Administration, according to another government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private details. A GSA spokeswoman has not responded to requests for comment about plans for the facility, and it\u2019s unclear if this precise location is the one that is under consideration as part of the administration\u2019s homeless plan.\n\nThe site is a six-story building with a glass-and-aluminum exterior, according to the Los Angeles Conservancy. It was for sale for $55 million as recently as this summer, according to Haidar Awad, a Hawthorne city council member, but the city could not confirm it was recently toured by administration officials.\n\nWhen the FAA was deciding what to do with the building, a private developer had proposed converting it into housing \u2013 a plan met with swift opposition from local residents. The site is located near two affluent gated communities near Manhattan Beach.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you if this was the shelter it would cause a fight,\u201d Awad said. \u201cThere would be an uproar.\u201d\n\nA resident whose gated complex abuts the FAA property said many of her neighbors are already voicing objections to living next to a potential homeless shelter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very quiet around here. We rarely ever get any contact with the homeless, and when we do, it\u2019s not pleasant. They\u2019re very confrontational,\" said the mother of two young boys, who did not want to be named because she feared alienating her neighbors as well as her boss, who are big supporters of Trump. \u201cSafety is a huge issue for me, which is why we chose a gated community.\u201d\n\nTrump administration officials signaled openness to a dramatic federal intervention in the burgeoning homeless population living in \u201cskid row\u201d during meetings with local homelessness advocates this week.\n\nAdvocates remain apprehensive about the administration\u2019s intentions amid uncertainty over how or if any Trump plan would help residents, said Jerry Jones, policy director at the Inner City Law Center, which does legal and tenant services in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI think people are more concerned than they are hopeful,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere is concern about their sincerity in trying to get homeless people housed.\u201d\n\nAbout 15 administration officials visited \u201cskid row\u201d on a tour led by Rev. Andy Bales, CEO of the Union Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter there.\n\nBales said he pleaded with Trump officials for a major federal intervention involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency to build shelters that could protect thousands of homeless people from contracting fatal diseases during the city\u2019s rainy season.\n\nHe said he had stressed to them that it is within the federal government\u2019s power to declare a disaster and hire contractors to set up new structures for the homeless, both in Los Angeles and other cities across the country. He said members of the administration, led by HUD and the White House Domestic Policy Council, seemed receptive to the idea.\n\n\u201cThis is a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like national disaster and needs to be treated as such,\u201d said Bales, who lost his right leg in 2016 after he said he came into contact with flesh-eating bacteria while walking streets ridden with urine and feces. \u201cI have prayed for federal intervention.\u201d", "description": "The trip brings into sharp focus the Trump administration\u2019s tightly held effort to spotlight and intervene in California\u2019s growing homeless population.", "authors": ["Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy", "Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "September At Pm", "Tracy Jan Covers The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy For The Washington Post.
