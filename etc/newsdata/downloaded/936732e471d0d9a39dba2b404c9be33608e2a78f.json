(AP) - Tom Hoge began the new PGA Tour season with his career-best finish and kept right on going Thursday with an 8-under 64 for the early lead in the Sanderson Farms Championship.\n\nHoge, a runner-up last week at the Greenbrier, opened with three straight birdies and closed with a 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole at the Country Club of Jackson. He had a one-shot lead over Robert Streb, Cameron Percy and Seamus Power among the early starters.\n\nThunderstorms suspended play in the afternoon.\n\nJoaquin Niemann, the 20-year-old from Chile coming off a six-shot victory at the Greenbrier, opened with a 68.\n\nHoge is winless in 134 career starts on the PGA Tour. He went through the Korn Ferry Tour Finals last month to get his PGA Tour card back.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tom Hoge began the new PGA Tour season with his career-best finish and kept right on going Thursday with an 8-under 64 for the early lead in the Sanderson Farms Championship.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/sanderson_farms_championship_golf_00121_c0-153-3648-2279_s1770x1032.jpg?bd537fada304e30c9d63c0bfcd3db5af8899a7bf", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
