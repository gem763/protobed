Only six lakes worldwide showed a statistically significant decrease in blooms over that time.\n\nGreen algae blooms are seen at the Port Mayaca Lock and Dam on Lake Okeechobee on July 10, 2018 in Port Mayaca, Fla. Joe Raedle\n\nThere's nothing abnormal about occasional algal blooms. They can occur naturally when a lake's water warms in summer, and can be triggered when fertilizer applied to nearby land washes into lakes. Most disappear on their own within a few weeks. But under certain conditions they can grow out of control, spreading across hundreds of square miles and lasting for many months, suffocating fish and creating what's known as a dead zone.\n\nAlgal blooms can also create high levels of toxins in the water, such as the cyanotoxins produced by blue-green algae. People and animals exposed to algal toxins by drinking contaminated water, bathing in it or even being splashed can suffer skin rashes, fevers, breathing problems and liver and kidney damage.\n\nScience\n\nAlgal blooms in coastal waters \u2014 like Florida's annual red tides \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $82 million each year, mainly from losses in fisheries and tourism. But algal blooms in lakes, which can be sources of drinking water as well as places for recreation and tourism, cause annual losses of more than $2 billion in the United States, according to a 2009 study.\n\nSince 2016, toxic blooms of blue-green algae in Lake Okeechobee have caused an environmental crisis in Florida. A bloom in Lake Erie in 2014 forced Toledo to declare its water undrinkable for several days.\n\nThomas Frankovich, a biologist at Florida International University in Key Largo who wasn't involved in the new study, praised it for its use of satellite imagery to assess algal blooms, instead of manually testing water samples from each lake. \"It has a global perspective on phytoplankton blooms in lakes, something we really can't get using land-based measurements,\" he said.\n\nWhen algal blooms do occur, they can be curbed by the application of chemical herbicides and other techniques. But often, it's a matter of waiting until the algae die out.\n\nAs algal blooms become more common, water managers will need to take greater account of changes in lake temperatures and rainfall patterns, Ho said.\n\nFor Michalak, the best thing that can be done to prevent freshwater algal blooms is to limit climate change by cutting carbon emissions. But she agrees that lake management must become a higher priority. \"We will need to be much more aggressive in how we manage lakes in order to achieve the same outcome as we would have had climate change not been occurring,\" she said.\n\nWant more stories about science?\n\nSign up for the MACH newsletter and follow NBC News MACH on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "New study of large lakes around the world shows rising toll of algae overgrowth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4241170/1000x563_nbc-191017-algae-bloom-al-1253_da44c551c6049239c3cc948479bbdb15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
