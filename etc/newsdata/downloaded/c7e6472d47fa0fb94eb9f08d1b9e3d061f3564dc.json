The World Health Organization (WHO) describes burn-out as 'chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed,' along with three defining symptoms: feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy The listing in the WHO's catalog (the ICD-11) notes that 'burn-out refers specifically to phenomena in the occupational context and should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life.' It is distinct, the authors say, from other types of adjustment disorder, disorders specifically associated with stress, anxiety or fear-related disorders, and mood disorders - all of which have their own classifications.\n\n'Despite the best intentions of... instructing all employees to switch off their emails outside of work hours to avoid being stressed, this policy would be unlikely to be welcomed by employees who prioritise work performance goals and who would prefer to attend to work outside of hours if it helps them get their tasks completed.'\n\nIn France it became an actual law in 2017 to require companies with more than 50 employees to limit the times staff could send or answer emails.\n\nNew York City has considered becoming the first to afford employees the legal 'right to disconnect'.\n\nAnd the German car manufacturer, Volkswagen, has configured its email system so people only receive them within half an hour of the start or end of the working day and never at weekends.\n\nIn the study Dr Russell and her colleagues asked people how and when they managed their inboxes and interacted with others.\n\nThey found that people who were considered to have lower emotional stability were more likely to prefer being in control at all times.\n\nLikewise, people whose main goals were oriented around their work were more likely to want to stay connected so they could make better progress.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour.", "description": "Researchers from the University of Sussex used surveys of almost 6,000 people and found that those who were less emotionally stable or were career-oriented might want unlimited access.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/14/19886574-0-image-a-27_1571407046393.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
