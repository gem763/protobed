As a result, according to the report that POLITICO obtained Tuesday night, the employee\u2019s medical appointments were disrupted and the person left the Council\u2019s employ.\n\nThis was after he outed the identity of a prior employee who had complained about gender-based harassment by King in 2017. During a meeting in his house that year, he questioned the credibility of that employee to the rest of his staff, the Council found.\n\nKing also enabled his wife, an official with the high-powered healthcare workers union, 1199 SEIU, to use city resources for private work.\n\n\u201cTwo years after the #metoo movement first went viral, workplace harassment is still rampant and we have to keep pushing for sweeping structural change because it\u2019s not just a few bad apples,\u201d Van Bramer said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to the workers who refused to stay silent and I stand with you 100 percent.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s office has not returned calls for comment.\n\nThe report calls for him to be suspended without pay for 30 days, incur a $15,000 fine and operate under the watch of an outside monitor. The full Council is expected to vote on disciplinary actions next week.", "description": "Jimmy Van Bramer said Wednesday the Council should remove King if he does not voluntarily resign.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg", "Joe Anuta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/df/0d/ae4ad6f443ae88edf869fad19f9c/gettyimages-king-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
