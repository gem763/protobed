They've deliberately set out to seek and cause chaos, they're performing activity that makes it dangerous and slow for us to clear them.\n\n'And whilst were not anti-protest, we are against them repeatedly breaking the law and causing this really significant disruption and as the Commissioner said this morning, this isn't a game for Londoners.\n\n'We have other things that we should be doing across London. We've had to take officers from those local communities and stop doing anything that's is not critical or urgent towards business and that's just not right.'\n\nIt comes as Scotland Yard's top officer warned that the Met had been 'stretched' by the Extinction Rebellion protests, impeding its ability to respond to other crimes.\n\nDame Cressida said she hoped the protesters would choose to either 'protest lawfully' at Trafalgar Square or 'go home'.\n\nAt around 4pm this afternoon, the roads around Bank and Monument stations were closed due to the protests\n\nExtinction Rebellion turn their attention to London's businesses after week targeting government and transport hubs\n\nActivists targeted BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, in London on Monday, demanding that the world's major financial institutions stop funding what they describe as a looming environmental catastrophe.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which promotes revolt against established political, economic and social structures as a way to publicise its dramatic climate message, is in the middle of two weeks of civil disobedience in London.\n\nIts activists thronged the financial heart of London on Monday, blocking streets around locations such as the Bank of England and BlackRock.\n\nPolice attempt to remove a protester from a business headquarters this afternoon as Extinction Rebellion targeted BlackRock\n\nProtesters demonstrate outside the BlackRock headquarters in Throgmorton Avenue in London this afternoon\n\nActivists glued themselves to the doors of BlackRock while others staged a mock dinner party with rolled-up banknotes on their plates, a Reuters reporter said.\n\n'The City of London is a preeminent nexus of power in the global system that is killing our world,' said Carolina Rosa, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from BlackRock.\n\nExtinction Rebellion wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse.\n\nCritics say the group is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of capitalism without any clear idea of what would replace it, and that the world's energy needs cannot be met without fossil fuels.", "description": "Hundreds of protesters blocked roads in the City of London yesterday but the protest was cut a week short by the evening.
