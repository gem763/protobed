What they thought would be a routine victory became a rescue mission. They had, as one headline had it on Wednesday morning, \u201cstared into the abyss\u201d: trailing after nine minutes, two down by the break, defeat would have left them with no points, six behind Brugge and Paris Saint-Germain, one behind Galatasaray. Instead, they came back to draw 2-2, the damage limited, Casemiro suggesting that the \u201cpoint might have kept us alive\u201d. Yet there was still damage done, questions that remained unanswered.\n\nReal Madrid\u2019s Champions League fate in balance after draw with Club Brugge Read more\n\nThis time, that was particularly true of Thibaut Courtois, James Rodr\u00edguez and Gareth Bale, although it can be expanded to virtually the whole team, still failing to function, lacking a pattern, an idea and the \u201cintensity\u201d to which Zidane often turns. The Belgian goalkeeper was withdrawn at half-time; the explanation given was that he had been sick, vomiting at the break, but no one had been forewarned and no one offered an explanation for his ailments.\n\nBale and Rodriguez, the two men who had ended up staying in the summer despite being seemingly on the way out, were not included in the squad. They weren\u2019t fully fit, Zidane said afterwards, a reason offered retrospectively: there had been no prior agreement with Bale, who was ready to play. Nacho was withdrawn too, with ligament damage that will keep him out for a couple of months.\n\nMadrid remain bottom of the group but while first place seems unlikely now, they will expect to get through. If, that is, they improve. There is \u201cno margin for error now\u201d, the club\u2019s institutional director Emilio Butrague\u00f1o admitted. \u201cThis can\u2019t happen again,\u201d Vinicius said. \u201cWe have to do more, and better,\u201d Sergio Ramos insisted. \u201cAs simple as that.\u201d\n\nBeaten 3-0 in Paris, Madrid have a single point after two games: they have never started a Champions League campaign as badly. And it really was bad. Zidane claimed that Madrid had never played a first half like it. \u201cWhat I take with me is the second half; we played with commitment and heart,\u201d he said.\n\nLike the performance, like much of what the coach said after it, that didn\u2019t entirely convince. Madrid racked up 15 second-half shots, three more than in the first half, but only five of those were on target. Fifteen minutes of fury soon fizzled out and genuinely clear chances were few. This comeback was ultimately incomplete.\n\nAfter three league games in which they had allowed a solitary shot on target, Zidane stressing the importance of solidity, they had looked vulnerable every time Brugge came forward, the ease with which Madrid were undone startling as Emmanuel Bonaventure scored twice. Even the second half\u2019s best two chances arguably fell to Brugge: at 2-0 and in the last minute. Both would have ended it, and gone very close to ending Madrid\u2019s Champions League hopes.\n\nIn part, the fact that this should have been a routine victory may have explained the performance. Asked whether there had been a lack of concentration, Luka Modric conceded: \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe.\u201d But there are broader questions, fears not allayed by the post-match analysis, which offered few answers and in fact served more to deepen the doubts. Zidane\u2019s explanation over Bale and Rodriguez was short and vague, hinting at a certain continuing disconnect, as was his response to questions about Courtois. Madrid said that the goalkeeper had stomach problems and had been dizzy and sick at half-time, driven home by his father, unable to continue. \u201cHe had ... things,\u201d Zidane said.\n\nWhen Courtois didn\u2019t come out for the second half, the fans didn\u2019t know that. They had loudly whistled the team at the end of the first half, their displeasure expressed long and loud as the players made their way off. The keeper, while not directly to blame for either goal, has not won over supporters who would mostly have preferred Keylor Navas to stay, and was a target for much of the first-half frustration, exposed to their anger.\n\nRodrygo and the 'ilusi\u00f3n' of La Liga's 21st-century boys | Sid Lowe Read more\n\n\u201cCourtois hits rock bottom,\u201d Marca said. As Alphonse Areola came on, replacing the former Chelsea keeper, as far as the supporters knew this was a decision, not an obligation, and a statement too \u2013 and they cheered. The first thing Areola did was produce the save that denied Bonaventure a hat-trick that would have made a bad night even worse.", "description": "Recovering to draw 2-2 at the Bernab\u00e9u keeps them alive but the 13-time European champions have problems stacking up, with Thibaut Courtois the latest player under the microscope", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c633a9048c6403e1fee74f597c06c72521cc67d/109_125_2070_1242/master/2070.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=190e44d341902fd7134a96e26eefe0b7"}
