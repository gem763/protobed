I say to myself, whenever that happens you have got to stick together as a team, which the boys did [on Monday].\n\n\u201cI am really proud to see the boys stick together and in those situations where they say they would walk off the pitch, it is right because no player should be treated differently.\n\n\u201cWe are all equal. It is an equal game so we have all got to stay strong. Stay the same and the boys dealt with it well. Hopefully everything will be sorted properly by Uefa. Everything that happened was obviously not right but we have to stick together as a team and move on from it.\u201d", "description": "Callum Hudson-Odoi, the Chelsea and England winger, has said he would be in favour of walking off the pitch in response to racist abuse from the stands.", "authors": ["Sam Dean"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213188225-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7LchIcZj93b_1m3tlz73XgY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
