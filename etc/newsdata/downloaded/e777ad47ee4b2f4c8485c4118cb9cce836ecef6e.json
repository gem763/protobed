For a limited time, it's offering a free three-month trial of its $89 Advance NBN 50 plan. But here's the interesting bit: there's no lock-in contract and you don't even need to hand over a credit card! Here are the details.\n\n'Free' NBN trials are nothing new - it's one of the most common tricks used by telcos to lock customers into lengthy contracts. However, this offer from new-kid-on-the-block FibreMax is a little different.\n\nAs mentioned, there's no obligation to continue your membership once the trial ends. In fact, FibreMax will automatically terminate your connection after three months, which is practically unheard of.\n\nHere's the official pitch from the company:\n\nWe are inviting you to become a FibreMax HERO. As a FibreMax HERO you will have access to our unlimited Advance NBN 50 plan. Our Advance NBN 50 plan is for small to medium businesses or power home users that are looking for constant faster downloads. This is an absolutely free and no obligation offer. You don\u2019t even have to provide your bank details. Enjoy this advanced service for 3 months. After this period the service will automatically terminate, no questions asked. You will be given the option to continue with the service, but you are under no obligation.\n\nSo what's the catch? FibreMax reserves the right to \"record\" your user experience, but that's to be expected. The whole point of the trial is for FibreMax to test its NBN service. Note that you might be required to use your home internet daily (which most of us do already) and provide weekly feedback about the experience.\n\nWhile the above sounds fine, we're a bit leery of FibreMax's bare-bones product page - we couldn't see any T&Cs and the site makes no mention of average evening speeds. So maybe proceed with a modicum of caution.\n\nAs you'd expect, spots are limited so we advise signing up sooner rather than later if you're keen to test the service. FibreMax also reserves the right to cancel the trial after giving 30 days notice.\n\nAfter the trial ends, FibreMax's Advance NBN 50 plan will set customers back $89 per month. Here's how that compares to other NBN 50 offerings from rival telcos:\n\nYou can sign up to FibreMax's three-month NBN trial here.\n\nFind more great bargains at Lifehacker Coupons.\n\nAs Lifehacker editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
