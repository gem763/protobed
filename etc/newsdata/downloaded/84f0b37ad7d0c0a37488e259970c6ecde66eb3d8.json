A slim girl with almost no body hair but it turned out that not resembling Kenny-something was not the foundation for a lasting relationship, although admittedly it was a good start.\n\nFour years passed and the kid who was now a man had taken a position writing features stories for a newspaper in Florida, and in the course of one such feature story a man named Tuffy Truesdale\u2014all this was a while ago and possibly not the correct spelling\u2014talked the feature writer into wrestling his bear. The bear\u2019s name was Victor, and the spelling of the bear is correct. Tuffy was 50 or so and had been a professional wrestler himself and was much scarier than his bear, even if you imagined him fitted with a muzzle like the one Victor was required by the Palm Beach County Health Department to wear. A terrifying presence, which in no way prepared our feature writer for the persuasiveness of the philosopher beneath.", "description": "Victor the bear traveled the country in two Chevy Impalas fused together taking on all comers in wrestling matches\u2014including a young feature writer.", "authors": ["Pete Dexter", "Jeff Nale"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492115411/articles/2016/03/12/wrestling-a-bear-to-save-my-manhood/160311-dexter-nale-bear-tease_hhxlj7", "published_at": "2016-03-12"}
