It\u2019s like being in a bar just before closing time.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re to get anywhere, this tribalism and pursuit of people to blame must stop.\u201d\n\nTanna\u2019s top-level call is for what she describes as a \u201cthoughtful transition\u201d that plays to the strength of both coal-fired power and renewable energy, recognising the need to encourage investment so the inevitable retirement of a dozen coal-fired plants in the next three decades is managed carefully and the necessary firming power required to support intermittent renewables is developed in way that is affordable and simple for customers.\n\nNothing in that seems very controversial.\n\nBut Tanna\u2019s five-point plan to deliver this underscores how the tone of the debate has got in the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer plan calls for: The government needs to drop its \u201cbig stick\u201d rhetoric; the sector needs to commit to a national energy framework; the right signals need to be sent to encourage the private sector to invest the estimated $400 billion needed to fund the transition; state government bans on gas development must be lifted; and independent regulators should be left alone to do their jobs.\n\nTo Chanticleer\u2019s untrained eye, Tanna\u2019s point that tone is important is well made.\n\nFor example, it seemed that in his address to the summit, Taylor was unwilling to talk about the boom in renewable generation as a success of the Australian industry, instead positioning it as almost like a threat. Similarly, Victoria\u2019s energy minister Lily D\u2019Ambrosio seemed keen on Wednesday to paint coal-fire plants as old clunkers as she doubled down on her government\u2019s target of delivering 50 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nNeither position would seem helpful in finding solutions that benefit both consumers and the climate over the next few decades, which is surely where we need to be looking.\n\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims, who also addressed the summit on Thursday, would say retailers such as EnergyAustralia brought no small part of this current rhetoric on itself, by, in his view, creating a deliberately confusing pricing environment that it could profit from.\n\nSims also said energy producers\u2019 call for better market signals to encourage investment in firming power options such as fast-start gas peaking plants were also somewhat disingenuous. Are companies that are making a lot of money from high electricity prices really that keen to see prices fall, Sims asked.\n\nThis is a very fair question, although perhaps a short term issue.\n\nCompanies like EnergyAustralia know there\u2019s a transition underway, and it will not stop. The fossil fuel plants they might profit from today will eventually be rendered useless; that\u2019s why, as Tanna says, EnergyAustralia has one of the largest renewable energy portfolios in the country.\n\nTanna is right to call for a moderate, thoughtful tone to solve what are big and crucial problems. But as these challenges become more urgent, it seems the solutions get further away.", "description": "EnergyAustralia chief executive Catherine Tanna is right to call for a moderate, thoughtful tone to solve what are big and crucial problems.
