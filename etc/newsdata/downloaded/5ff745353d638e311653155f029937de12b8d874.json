Called \u201cgrantees,\u201d those organizations receive federal grants and distribute them among clinics that directly provide services to women.\n\nAbout 930 clinics serving an estimated 900,000 clients have been affected by grantees leaving the program.\n\nThe money returned to the government has been divided up among organizations that remained, said Foley, among them state and local health departments.\n\nHowever, five states will no longer be served by the federal program. They are Maine, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. Foley said in those cases the states themselves have pledged to replace federal funding.\n\nIn a statement, Planned Parenthood vice president Jacqueline Ayers said the Trump administration was \u201cfrantically scrambling to try to fill the gaps\u201d caused by the fallout from its own policy. The administration \u201ccontinues to fall far short of preserving access to care for patients who need it the most,\u201d she added.\n\nThe administration earlier this year imposed a series of restrictions on Title X clinics, winning applause from religious conservatives that are a key part of President Donald Trump\u2019s political base. The new rules included the ban on abortion referrals and requirements for financial and physical separation from abortion providers. Planned Parenthood offers both women\u2019s health services and abortions.\n\nLawsuits challenging the abortion restrictions are working their way through federal courts, which so far have ruled the administration\u2019s policy can go into effect while the legal issues are decided.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and other groups say the ban on abortion referrals is in effect a \u201cgag rule\u201d on providing full medical information to patients.\n\nWhile abortion is a legal medical procedure, backers of the administration\u2019s move say it is not a form of family planning. Religious conservatives have long seen the family planning program as an indirect subsidy to Planned Parenthood, even though family planning grants could not be used to pay for abortion services.\n\nAccording to the latest research, the number and rate of abortions in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest levels since 1973, when the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion in all the states. Part of the reason for decline is seen as better access to birth control, which health plans must now cover free of charge as a preventive service for women.\n\nThe Title X program serves nearly 4 million clients a year, mainly low-income women who may not be covered by workplace health plans. Some experts have warned that disruptions to the program could lead to an increase in unintended pregnancies, and more abortions.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Federal officials said Monday they're redirecting nearly $34 million to cover gaps in access to birth control for low-income women after Trump administration abortion restrictions led to an exodus of clinics from the federal family planning program.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/trump_family_planning_61416_c0-180-6338-3875_s1770x1032.jpg?44796fb1419f732a1d38f2468f81391e3bfc1a60", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
