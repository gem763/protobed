Though those numbers are expected to fluctuate, it\u2019s expected to remain a hurricane over the next few days.\n\nDorian was moving north to northeast at around 8 mph, but will speed up into Friday, with the center of the storm moving toward the coast of South Carolina on Thursday, and up into North Carolina on Thursday night and into Friday.\n\n\u201cIt is serious, and it can be deadly,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at a news conference Thursday morning, NPR reported. \u201cThe message this morning is this: Get to safety and stay there. Don\u2019t let your guard down. This won\u2019t be a brush-by. Whether it comes ashore or not, the eye of the storm will be close enough to cause extensive damage in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nBy Friday night, the center is expected to move to the southeast of southeastern New England, and will approach Nova Scotia in Canada on Saturday, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nRELATED: Here\u2019s How You Can Help the Victims of Deadly Hurricane Dorian\n\nDaytona Beach, Florida | JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock More\n\nHurricane warnings are now in effect from the Savannah River to the North Carolina-Virginia border, as well as for the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds.\n\nThe advisory also warns that water levels in South Carolina will rise well before strong winds hit, and that large and destructive waves should be expected, too.\n\nThe Coastal Carolinas are expected to receive between 6 and 12 inches of rainfall through Friday, while far Southeast Virginia should get between 3 and 8 inches. Extreme Southeastern New England should brace for 2-4 inches.\n\nThere\u2019s also a possibility that tornadoes will emerge in the coastal South and North Carolina border area on Thursday afternoon, according to the advisory. CNN reported on Thursday that a tornado destroyed homes and buildings on Emerald Isle, North Carolina, and several other tornadoes have been reported in the state.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Husband Helplessly Watched Wife Drown in Hurricane Dorian Floodwaters\n\nDorian made landfall in the Bahamas over the weekend, causing \u201cgenerational devastation\u201d and killing at least 20 people, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a press conference Wednesday that was live-streamed by the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cWe expect that this number will increase,\u201d he said of the deaths, which all occurred on the heavily-hit Abaco Island.\n\nOn Thursday, the New York Times reported that the death toll has risen to 23.\n\nRELATED: Hurricane Dorian Causes \u2018Historic Tragedy\u2019 \u2014 Here, Some of the Most Devastating Photos\n\nThe storm has destroyed homes, business and other buildings on the island, though Minnis said the flooding has receded in Freeport and Grand Bahama.\n\nThough a \u201csignificant\u201d number of people remain in shelters, most homes in Grand Bahama appear to have received only minor damage, Minnis said.\n\nBloomberg reported Thursday that damage throughout the island could cost the Bahamas an estimated $7 billion in damages.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian Hits Carolinas as Bahamas Death Toll Rises to 23", "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PWQMlr9qJtbchbN5rb27kQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/21926678e8fb4408408a9ee6f1672238", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
