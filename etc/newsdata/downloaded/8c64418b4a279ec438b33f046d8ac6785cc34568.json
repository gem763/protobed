Trey Gowdy must wait a \u201ccouple months\u201d before joining his personal legal team one day after his new role was announced.\n\nTrump said lobbying rules are preventing the former Republican congressman from South Carolina from joining the team immediately.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a problem with \u2026 he can\u2019t start for another couple months because of lobbying rules and regulations,\u201d the president said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll have to ask about that. I just heard that Trey Gowdy can\u2019t start til some time after January because of the lobbying rules and regulations. So I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, announced Gowdy\u2019s new role as an outside adviser Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI have known Trey for years and worked with him when he served in Congress,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cHis legal skills and his advocacy will serve the president well. Trey\u2019s command of the law is well known and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team.\u201d\n\nA Fox spokesperson said Gowdy\u2019s role as a contributor with Fox News was terminated amid rumors of his new role due to it being a conflict of interest.\n\nGowdy declined to seek re-election in 2018 after four terms in the House. He was first elected to Congress in 2010, and chaired of the House oversight committee and the House Benghazi committee.\n\nHis addition to Trump\u2019s legal team comes as the president prepares for an impeachment battle over his pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking to unseat the president in the 2020 election. It\u2019s unclear how the delay in joining the legal team will impact Gowdy\u2019s role in impeachment proceedings.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday that former Rep.
