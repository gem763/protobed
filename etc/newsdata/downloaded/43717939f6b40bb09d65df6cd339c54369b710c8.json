The team didn't disclose contract terms, but ESPN reported it was for $134 million US, with $110 million guaranteed.\n\nGoff is beginning his fourth year with the Rams, who made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft. After a rocky rookie season, Goff has become a two-time Pro Bowl selection under coach Sean McVay over the past two years.\n\nGoff has passed for 8,492 yards with 60 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in 31 regular-season games as McVay's starter. He also led the Rams to two playoff victories before the Super Bowl, where he struggled in a 19-for-38 performance for 229 yards in Los Angeles' 13-3 loss.\n\nEven after Carson Wentz, the No. 2 pick behind Goff in the 2016 draft, got a $128 million extension from the Eagles in June, Goff said he had no concerns about entering his fourth season without a new deal. Now he won't have to.\n\nGoff is making about $4.3 million this season before his pay is scheduled to jump to $22.8 million in 2020.", "description": "Quarterback Jared Goff has agreed to a four-year contract extension with the Los Angeles Rams through the 2024 season.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269485.1567561369!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rams-goff-extension-football.jpg"}
