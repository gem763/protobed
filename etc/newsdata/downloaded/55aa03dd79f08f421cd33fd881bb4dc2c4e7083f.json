That our player has never been diagnosed with an alleged anxiety picture and therefore, that information is absolutely false.\n\n'2. That Thibaut Courtois has been diagnosed and treated for acute gastroenteritis with dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which made it impossible to end last Tuesday's game against Bruges.\n\n'3. The player currently responds favorably to the treatment.'\n\nNew boy Alphonse Areola came on for the second period and kept a clean sheet in goal\n\nCourtois's place as Madrid No 1 has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks\n\nMadrid came back in the match and salvaged a 2-2 draw, with substitute keeper Alphonse Areola keeping a clean sheet in the second half and Sergio Ramos and Casemiro finding the back of the opposition goal.\n\nCourtois' place as Madrid No 1 has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks, after a series of controversial errors.\n\nThe 27-year-old came out recently and admitted the criticism aimed in his direction is all part and parcel of being a Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nSpeaking to Spanish publication Marca he said: 'If you want to be a Real Madrid goalkeeper, you have to accept this pressure.'\n\nLikewise, Belgium goalkeeping coach Erwin Lemmens has backed his mentee to rediscover his best form in the coming weeks once he is over the illness, but only if Madrid work better with the player.\n\nCourtois reacts during a horrendous first half in which he conceded twice for Real\n\nCourtois can only watch on as Dennis scores Club Brugge's opening goal at the Bernabeu\n\n'They [Madrid] have to treat him differently,' he said to Radio MARCA, before going on to compare he struggles with that of David De Gea at Manchester United.\n\n'He's a special boy and it's unusual that he's always at the highest level with us, but there he suffers with [David] De Gea syndrome.'\n\n'If the Bernabeu whistles then you have to look at the team as a whole,' Lemmens added.\n\n'Why shouldn't he start on Saturday? He was sick yesterday and was changed for the second half. He's a great goalkeeper and he'll try to make Real Madrid happy again.'", "description": "Real Madrid have publicly hit back at reports that goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois had to be withdraw at half-time during the Champions League tie with Brugge due to anxiety issues.", "authors": ["Danny Gallagher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19295748-0-image-a-58_1570190759771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
