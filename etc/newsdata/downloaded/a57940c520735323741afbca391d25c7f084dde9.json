But as Brown lay waste to Oakland this past week, engulfing the entire organization in a firestorm of madness that included a recorded conversation of Raiders head coach Jon Gruden and an Instagram post demanding his release from his team of six months, it was Brown\u2019s former club that looked like geniuses.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAntonio Brown won't face his former team, the Steelers, on Sunday night. But a rematch could present itself in the AFC playoffs now that Brown is a Patriot. (AP)\n\nAfter years of dealing with Brown\u2019s diva-like antics and his vanishing act before their biggest game of 2018, the Steelers were content to be like the rest of us \u2014 casual observers of Brown\u2019s destructive behavior and the demise of his good standing with Oakland\u2019s front office.\n\nBrown, and his baggage, were the Raiders\u2019 headache now. And vindication belonged to Mike Tomlin and the Steelers.\n\nGood riddance, right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nPittsburgh presumed it had finally rid itself of its worst problem, but no one in the organization could have foreseen this: Their worst nightmare potentially standing in their path to an AFC title and, possibly, a Super Bowl.\n\nBrown\u2019s calculated finesse move \u2014 orchestrating his exit out of Oakland and away from Gruden\u2019s old-school ways and the Raiders\u2019 suspect roster \u2014 landed him in the promised land.\n\nIn Foxborough.\n\nRight at the doorstep of Bill Belichick.\n\nThe evil genius, who embarrassed Sean McVay\u2019s upstart Los Angeles Rams to win Super Bowl LIII, has now joined forces with the devilishly-clever diva, who proved this week that he\u2019s as talented an actor as he is receiver.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe only thing missing from this soap opera-style saga is Brown\u2019s presence on the sideline Sunday night at Gillette Stadium when the Steelers face the Patriots. (A league spokesman confirmed to NFL Network that Brown is not allowed \u201cto be with or around the team\u201d because he is not \u201cofficially\u201d a member of the Patriots.) Nevertheless, business is \u201cboomin\u201d on Patriots Way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tomlin and the Steelers will undoubtedly insist that nothing has changed from their perspective. As far as they\u2019re concerned, Brown is a part of their past. Just like running back Le\u2019Veon Bell.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert stressed the importance of focusing on the future \u2014 not outside perception or the drama brewing in Oakland.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a right to an opinion and things will be written or talked about that we may not necessarily agree with,\u201d Colbert said in a recent phone interview with Yahoo Sports, referring to the criticisms the organization received for dealing Brown, who caught 837 receptions for 11,207 yards and 74 touchdowns for Pittsburgh, for arguably so little. \u201cAnd it really doesn't matter what our perception is on the outside as long as we know that we're doing what's right on the inside.\n\n\u201cMr. Rooney, who passed, taught us a long time ago to always do what's right. And if you asked him, \u2018Well, what's right?\u2019 he would simply reply, \u2018If you don't know. then you shouldn't be in the position you're in.\u2019 So we always feel that we try to handle everything the right way. But we also know that people may not perceive it that way. But if we feel good from the inside, then great. And last year we didn't feel good because we were 9-6-1. And there's various reasons why we were, but simply we weren't good enough. And that was more tangible than intangible.\u201d\n\nOf course, that was before Brown manipulated his way out of Oakland, embarrassed Gruden and Raiders general manager Mike Mayock in the process, and latched on with the defending Super Bowl champions. All in the span of 24 hours.\n\nCoach Mike Tomlin and Antonio Brown spent nine seasons together in Pittsburgh. (AP)\n\nAfter years of coddling the uber-talented, me-first prima donna, Pittsburgh agreed to eat an eye-popping $21 million in salary cap just to get rid of Brown. But in doing so, the Steelers unwittingly delivered Brown to an untenable Raiders situation and ultimately paved the way for the receiver\u2019s greatest disappearing act.\n\nTwo savages have now converged in New England.\n\nBelichick, the greatest football mind in the game. And Brown, the game\u2019s most maddening and electrifying offensive weapon.\n\nAnd they both have their sights on the biggest prize of all: a Super Bowl.\n\nSteelers be damned.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Pittsburgh presumed it had finally rid itself of its worst problem, but no one in the organization could have foreseen this: Their worst nightmare potentially standing in their path to an AFC title and, possibly, a Super Bowl.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5MP4eIUzwzmf14BnwsceJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wlokZj3VaaLfBsBw9aFeEQ--~B/aD0xOTczO3c9Mjk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/52e87b80-3ada-11e9-b87d-b53f3dc19931", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
