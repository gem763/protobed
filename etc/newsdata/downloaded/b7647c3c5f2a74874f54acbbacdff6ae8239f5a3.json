The anaesthetist was adamant it wasn\u2019t safe to proceed with the surgery.\n\nBut Evelyn was ready to fight back. At home, with the support of her daughter, Mairiona, 69, she began to walk round her garden while the kettle was boiling, increasing the circuit to four times a day. She also began to breathe more deeply, holding each breath for 25 seconds.\n\nAfter just eight weeks, she returned to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and passed the fitness test with flying colours. She then had the surgery in 2017, recovering with improved health all-round. \u2018I\u2019ve picked up my amateur painting again and have just won a prize for my embroidery,\u2019 says Evelyn. \u2018I\u2019m still driving and love gardening.\u2019\n\nWhile our population is ageing, the age of the ten million patients who undergo surgery in the NHS annually is rising faster. The average age in England is 40, but for surgical patients it\u2019s 54, the British Journal of Surgery reported in May. Eight in 100 Britons are now over 75, but they account for one in four operations. Yet making a decision about surgery for older people can be complicated.\n\nThe more birthdays you\u2019ve had, the riskier surgery can be.\n\nCommon health problems related to ageing, such as high blood pressure, clogged arteries, and heart and lung disease, leave older people with an increased risk of dangerous and potentially fatal complications such as bleeding or infection during or after surgery.\n\nNow researchers in Canada have identified a new risk. As The Lancet reported in August, one in 14 surgery patients aged over 65 is at risk of a \u2018covert\u2019 or \u2018silent\u2019 stroke \u2014 where a clot reduces blood flow briefly to a part of the brain that doesn\u2019t control any obvious functions and therefore may not cause any symptoms immediately.\n\nYet the impact \u2014 detectable on an MRI scan \u2014 can lead to measurable cognitive decline a year later, frequently involving depression as well as memory and concentration problems and an increased risk of dementia and having a major stroke.\n\n\u2018Surgeons are now able to operate on older and sicker patients and, despite the benefits it brings, we need to understand the risks,\u2019 said Marko Mrkobrada, a professor of medicine at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, up to one in 200 patients aged over 65 suffers a stroke perioperatively \u2014 during or immediately after an operation \u2014 if it causes, or worsens, a weakness in a blood vessel supplying the brain.\n\nAt home, with the support of her daughter, Mairiona, 69, she began to walk round her garden while the kettle was boiling, increasing the circuit to four times a day. Pictured: Evelyn with her daughter Mairiona in 2016\n\nA major study involving 2,000 older patients undergoing surgery, published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia last month, suggests that exposure to anaesthesia after the age of 70 causes \u2018long-term changes in brain function including a subtle decline in memory and thinking skills\u2019, as the lead researcher, Dr Juraj Sprung, an anaesthesiologist from the Mayo Clinic in the U.S., explained. But the jury is still out as to what\u2019s behind this.\n\n\u2018The exact mechanism causing this change in cognition is not well understood,\u2019 says James Pickett, head of research at the charity Alzheimer\u2019s Society. \u2018Some research suggests this is as a result of the surgery, while other studies point to the anaesthesia.\u2019\n\nThere is some evidence concentration and memory problems can result from disorientation of being hospitalised. The American Society of Anesthesiologists last year advised relatives they could help patients\u2019 rehabilitation by bringing in family photos, a clock and calendar to help patients readjust to normal life.\n\nBut how can the UK best ensure that older people get safe surgery when they need it?\n\nFive years ago, the NHS spoke out against age discrimination following evidence that up to 14,000 older patients were dying every year because they were denied surgery. \u2018Age should never stop you having an operation,\u2019 says Dr Jonathan Hewitt, a stroke specialist at the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in Cardiff.\n\nA key priority for successful surgery in older age is the involvement of a range of health professionals \u2014 notably specialists in this age group \u2014 rather than care simply being provided by surgeons with anaesthetic and nursing support. Dr Hewitt is a member of Older Persons Surgical Outcomes Collaboration (OPSOC), a newly established international group of surgeons, geriatricians and statisticians whose aim is to bring different health professionals together to improve the surgical care of older people.\n\nIt is also recognised that older patients must have a voice, explains Dr Mike Swart, a consultant in anaesthesia and critical care medicine at Torbay Hospital and the Royal College of Anaesthetists\u2019 clinical lead for perioperative medicine, as they often focus on something that may not be a real risk. \u2018If you have had a stroke before, that can be the biggest worry, even if there\u2019s not much risk statistically,\u2019 he says.\n\nAfter just eight weeks, Evelyn returned to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and passed the fitness test with flying colours\n\nDiagnosed with bowel cancer two years ago at the age of 63, Simon Pillinger needed an urgent operation, but he felt that the first surgeon he saw had little interest in what mattered to him.\n\nHe felt the surgeon was \u2018railroading\u2019 him into surgery that could damage his sex life and leave him with a permanent colostomy bag. \u2018He wanted to do the operation his way, regardless of its impact on me,\u2019 says the former policeman from Weston-super-Mare.\n\nHe asked for a second opinion and was referred to Kathryn McCarthy. The consultant colorectal surgeon at North Bristol NHS Trust took a very different approach. They talked through Simon\u2019s choices and decided to go for nerve-sparing surgery that would avoid incontinence and loss of sexual function, and with a temporary colostomy bag.\n\nIn a pioneering perioperative clinic at Torbay Hospital in Devon, high-risk older patients receive an hour-long, one-to-one consultation with senior clinicians, who help to provide support in the patient\u2019s decision-making.\n\nMoving forward, a major new study will investigate the impact on older patients of a decision not to carry out an operation deemed necessary for whatever reason.\n\nCurrently, how fitness for surgery is defined varies, and that needs to change, says Susan Moug, a consultant colorectal surgeon and clinical associate professor at the University of Glasgow.\n\nNew evidence confirms, unsurprisingly, that it\u2019s not age itself but how frail a person is that det-ermines the response to surgery.\n\nIn a study, published in the journal Age and Ageing in February, UK researchers monitored 2,279 surgical emergency cases in those aged under 40 to over 80. They reported that the more frail the patient, the more likely they were to die, independent of age.\n\nBut surgery is not for every older person, including those with early signs of dementia whose disease may be worsened by the anaesthesia or the surgery itself.\n\n\u2018It may be that someone with a moderately painful hip who is referred for surgery with early dementia should consider whether they can manage without the operation if the pain is manageable by other means,\u2019 says Dr Swart.\n\nAbove all, adds surgeon Kathryn McCarthy, \u2018we need to raise awareness among patients about what\u2019s involved in surgery so they can make an informed decision about the risks versus the benefits\u2019.\n\nUNDER THE WEATHER\n\nThe health concerns worsened by cold weather. This week: Mood\n\nAround one in 15 people in the UK says their mood is severely affected between the months of September and April, as the days get shorter and darker.\n\nLack of light is thought to be a major contributor to winter mood. \u2018Specifically, the lack of morning light in winter can affect our mood, alertness and how long it takes the groggy feeling we have upon waking (so-called sleep inertia) to dissipate,\u2019 says Victoria Revel, a chronobiologist at the University of Surrey.\n\n\u2018Getting bright light upon awakening and during the daytime hours in winter is therefore very important. Light upon waking will keep your body clock in check. Using a light box at your desk during the day can help keep up your energy, mood and alertness during the day; as can getting outside into natural daylight.\u2019\n\nMILITARY MEDICINE\n\nMedical breakthroughs that began on the battlefield. This week: Chemotherapy (stock image)\n\nMedical breakthroughs that began on the battlefield. This week: Chemotherapy\n\nIt\u2019s been the mainstay of cancer treatment since the 1950s, but the first form of chemotherapy was based on deadly mustard gas.\n\nIn the trenches of World War I, this chemical weapon killed tens of thousands of soldiers through asphyxiation brought on by blisters the gas caused in their throat and lungs.\n\nScientists at Yale University in the U.S. later discovered that mustard gas also appeared to kill white blood cells, infection-fighting cells produced in bone marrow.\n\nScientists wondered if it could do the same to cancer cells and, in 1942, tested it on a man riddled with lymphomas.\n\nHe was given nitrogen mustard, the compound used to make mustard gas and the tumours shrank.\n\nScientists later developed safer, more effective chemotherapy drugs, although they still have unpleasant side-effects.", "description": "Evelyn initially failed a pre-operative fitness test.
