The move may encourage other lenders to follow suit, with both Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG signaling that they\u2019re warming to the idea.\n\n\u201cThings are changing in the industry and we expect further negative interest rates, especially since one of the major cooperative lenders has now taken that step,\u201d said Oliver Maier, co-head of market researcher Verivox Finanzvergleich.\n\nGermany\u2019s banks have long resisted passing on the burden of negative rates to retail clients, concerned that they will face reputational damage and mass withdrawals. But after five years of negative rates from the European Central Bank, the country\u2019s banks -- already struggling with sub-par profitability -- are running out of ways to offset the hit to earnings.\n\nAt least 34 German lenders have already opted to drag some retail clients into the fray of negative rates, according to data provider Biallo.de. Most of them, however, are smaller banks and the threshold is often well above the 100,000 euro mark set by Berliner Volksbank. Many have passed on the costs to corporate and wealth clients for some time.\n\nCosting Billions\n\nThe rate policy is costing German lenders 2.4 billion euros a year, according to the country\u2019s banking lobby. Last month, the ECB reduced the deposit rate to minus 0.5% from minus 0.4%. Lenders will get exemptions from the negative rate for some of their deposits.\n\nBerliner Volksbank tied its new policy to the ECB\u2019s latest move. Deutsche Skatbank, which imposed the same minus 0.5% rate for accounts that exceed 100,000 euros, said it is \u201cno longer economically justifiable to continue to bear the ECB\u2019s negative interest rate in full.\u201d\n\nAccording to the German association of cooperative lenders, other banks within the group might follow. \u201cIt can not be ruled out that additional customers or products will be affected,\u201d said spokeswoman Cornelia Schulz.\n\nSome of Germany\u2019s largest banks, which have so far mostly resisted involving their customers, have also signaled the need to act:\n\nDeutsche Bank needs to be \u201cmore robust\u201d in sharing the consequences of negative rates, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said last month. Companies and wealthy clients could see a tiered system with favorable rates up to a certain cap in deposits, while retail clients may end up paying through fees for services, he added.Commerzbank isn\u2019t currently considering passing on the costs to retail clients, CFO Stephan Engels said in September. The lender will have \u201cfocused discussions\u201d about doing so with clients who have funds that surpass \u201ccertain thresholds,\u201d he said in a Bloomberg TV interview.\n\nDanish Banks Giving in to Pressure\n\nDenmark is another country where the idea is gaining traction. Spar Nord Bank A/S will apply a minus 0.75% rate on deposits exceeding 750,000 kroner ($110,000), it said on Thursday. The move comes after Jyske Bank A/S, Denmark\u2019s second-largest listed lender, said it is doing the same.\n\nGerman citizens save far more of their disposable income than most other Europeans and so the overall impact of such moves could be bigger. The country\u2019s savings rate was around 10% in 2017, almost twice the euro-area average, according to Deutsche Bank. On average, Germans held more than 40% of their financial assets in the form of bank deposits in 2018.\n\nOne in two Germans would probably change lenders if their own bank resorts to negative rates, according to a study by management consultant Investors Marketing. \u201cLenders must be aware that they will not easily win back customers they have lost due to these measures,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Oliver Mihm.\n\n(Bank lobby statement added in 8th paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephan Kahl in Frankfurt at skahl@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Schaefer at dschaefer36@bloomberg.net, Ross Larsen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A growing number of German banks are passing on negative interest rates to their retail customers as the costs become too high to bear on their own.Berliner Volksbank, the country\u2019s second-largest cooperative lender, started to apply a minus 0.5% rate on deposits exceeding 100,000 euros", "authors": ["Stephan Kahl"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
