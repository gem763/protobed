But the calls are so noisy that scientists are intrigued about how white bellbird females listen at close range without damaging their hearing.\n\nBiologist Jeff Podos at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who studied the bellbirds alongside Mario Cohn-Haft from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia in Brazil, said he believed the females could be risking their hearing to size-up potential mates.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In these cases, we saw that the males sing only their loudest songs. Not only that, they swivel dramatically during these songs, so as to blast the song\u2019s final note directly at the females.\n\n\u201cWe would love to know why females willingly stay so close to males as they sing so loudly. Maybe they are trying to assess males up close, though at the risk of some damage to their hearing systems.\u201d\n\nBellbirds weigh just half a pound (250g), but despite their diminutive size their calls are far louder than much larger animals, including bison and howler monkeys, according to Dr Podos.\n\nHowever, the birds still have some way to go to compete with the loudest recorded animal of all \u2013 the sperm whale. Sperm whales produce clicks which reach up to 230db and can be measured 500 miles away.\n\nDeep Purple\u2019s 1970s record has also since been broken, with the band Kiss hitting 139db during a 2009 concert in Ottowa, Canada \u2013 considerably louder than a bellbird\u2019s call.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We are truly at the early stages of understanding this biodiversity,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the new things the researchers learned is that there seems to be a trade-off at work for this behaviour \u2013 as bellbird and piha songs get louder, they also get shorter. This may be because the birds\u2019 respiratory systems have a finite ability to control airflow and generate sound.\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Current Biology.", "description": "The loudest\u00a0bird calls ever recorded come from male Amazonian bellbirds, which blast their 116-decibel one-note song directly at unflinching females as part of mating rituals, scientists have discovered.
