Both teams are 92-64 and two games behind Oakland, which leads the wild-card race.\n\nThe Phillies (79-75) are six games out in the NL wild-card chase with eight games left. They open a five-game series at Washington on Monday night. The Nationals and Brewers are tied for the top spot.\n\nCarrasco (6-7) relieved starter Adam Plutko with two on in the fifth and got All-Star catcher J.T. Realmuto to hit into an inning-ending double play. Carrasco, in his ninth appearance since leaving the club in June to treat leukemia, struck out three and allowed one hit in 2 2/3 scoreless innings.\n\nMercado\u2019s 14th home run off Vince Velasquez (7-8) broke a 1-all tie in the fifth. The Indians put the game away with a six-run seventh, which included Puig\u2019s double and a two-run homer by Franmil Reyes.\n\nThe Indians also received good news before their final home game of the season. Third baseman Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez is expected to return Tuesday night in Chicago after missing a month with a broken right hand. He was injured Aug. 24 and had surgery two days later for a broken hamate bone.\n\nFrancisco Lindor and Mike Freeman also drove in runs for Cleveland, which has won six of seven.\n\nRealmuto\u2019s RBI double put Philadelphia ahead in the third.\n\nThe Indians took advantage of two errors that ignited the fifth-inning rally, which paid off with Mercado\u2019s drive into the bleachers in left field on an 0-2 pitch from Velasquez.\n\nFielding errors by shortstop Jean Segura and Velasquez made all three runs unearned. Segura couldn\u2019t come up with a barehand grab of leadoff hitter Greg Allen\u2019s grounder. Velasquez fielded Roberto P\u00e9rez\u2019s bunt with his barehand but dropped the ball, putting two runners on.\n\nAfter a day off, Cleveland starts a three-game series against the White Sox and finishes with three games at Washington.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPhillies: RHP Juan Nicasio (tendinitis in right rotator cuff) threw batting practice Saturday and could return in the season\u2019s final week. He hasn\u2019t pitched since Aug. 23.\n\nIndians: LHP Brad Hand played catch before the game. He struck out the side Saturday in his first appearance since Sept. 8 because of a fatigued arm.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: RHP Zach Eflin (9-12, 4.00 ERA) will start Monday against Washington LHP Patrick Corbin (13-7, 3.10 ERA).\n\nIndians: RHP Mike Clevinger (12-3, 2.54 ERA) will face LHP H\u00e9ctor Santiago (1-1, 5.65 ERA) when Cleveland plays the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rookie Oscar Mercado hit a three-run homer, Yaisel Puig drove a three-run double and the Cleveland Indians moved into a tie for the second AL wild card with a 10-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Herrick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/phillies_indians_baseball_84224_c0-244-3919-2528_s1770x1032.jpg?b58bc9ffbab6e01ffa4557c2fd70fb990fb73c38", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
