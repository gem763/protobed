But XDI chief executive Rohan Hamden said in the at-risk areas it would be far above that, saying in the Adelaide Hills the cost was expected to rise \"100 fold\".\n\nThe study found the number of \"high risk\" properties, which currently sits at 383,300, would double to 735,654 by 2100. That figure only referred to existing properties, with future developments potentially adding to that figure.\n\nIt's worse for coastal inundation where the worst 20 per cent of large councils will see a 400 per cent increase of risk. \u2014 XDI report\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study assumes global greenhouse gas emissions will continue on trend, which scientists predict will result in an average global temperature rise of 4 to 6 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The international community is aiming to keep temperature increases below 2 degrees by 2100, but without a drastic globally-synchronised ramping up of emission reductions that target will not be met.\n\nMr Hamden said that meant businesses, governments and institutional investors would need to start factoring in the effects of climate change in earnest when making investment decisions.\n\nHe said the information in the report would be \u201cinvaluable for the private sector to understand the risks to their assets and investments\", adding it could help state governments understand which council areas to prioritise for adaptation.\n\n\u201cClimate related risks are very unevenly distributed. While average risks from flooding may increase by about 30 per cent due to climate, in 20 per cent of large councils flood risk will double,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt's worse for coastal inundation where the worst 20 per cent of large councils will see a 400 per cent increase of risk over coming decades.\n\n\u201cWith recent climate data companies being acquired by Moody's and MSCI, it\u2019s clear that climate risk data is becoming more and more available to insurers, banks and valuation companies and we need to better understand Australia\u2019s risk so that they can take steps to protect people, infrastructure and property.\"\n\nHe used the example of two companies that own petrol stations, one in high risk areas, and one in low risk areas. Without reliable climate change risk modelling, he said the two companies might look \"the same on paper\" to an investor. In reality their risk profiles are drastically different.\n\nMr Hamden said XDI would be marketing its data to companies such as banks and governments, but said it had decided to make this report public as a \"call to action\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf governments and communities act on this information now, many of the projected losses can be averted. Acting with a strategic focus on those communities most at risk will ensure that adaptation is achieved at least cost and can help protect people, infrastructure and assets from harm,\" he said.\n\nThe report answers a call from Australian financial regulators for more information on the nature of climate risk. Earlier this month the Reserve Bank of Australia warned that climate change posed a significant risk to the financial system, and said more data was needed on the nature of those risks.\n\n\"To manage their own direct exposure to physical risk, insurers and banks need granular information on the location and physical risks faced by the assets they insure or the collateral they lend against,\" the RBA said.\n\nGeoff Summerhayes, head of insurance at the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, earlier this year called for a \"common taxonomy around the economic impacts of climate\".\n\nHe said such a taxonomy was \"underdeveloped globally\".\n\n\"For a risk that is so all-pervasive, that is a concern. My point is it requires multi-disciplined activity. And I think the view here in Australia is that we shouldn't necessarily wait for a global standard. We should get on and advance that case ourselves,\" he said.", "description": "The Gold Coast, Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast will face the highest costs from extreme weather events by 2100, according to a major new study.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cbfb8d1d4527c11ceaab02730eb199d6fcaa365a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
