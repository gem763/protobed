Wallop.\"\n\nThe offences happened on the day of the most recent Birmingham City v Aston Villa game, a Championship fixture which Villa won 1-0 at St Andrew's, with Grealish scoring the winner.\n\nPerkins had denied the charges but was convicted a trial. He appeared to smile as he looked at his phone as he walked away from the court later.\n\nThe court heard Perkins, an accountancy and finance student at the University of Salford, had been drinking from 7am when he posted three tweets.\n\nThe tirade of abuse came minutes after Grealish was attacked on the pitch by a fan who ran from the stands.\n\nOne tweet showed a picture of the headstone of Grealish's brother, Keelan Grealish, who died in tragic circumstances as a baby.\n\nThe text on the tweet said: \"He may have scored but will never bring his dead brother back and that brings me more satisfaction than anything else ever could.\"\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nAnother tweet read: \"Grealish went down quicker than his brother got lowered into the grave.\"\n\nThe third said: \"Where's your brother gone? Come on!\"\n\nSimon Brownsey, prosecuting, told the court there was \"no dispute\" that Perkins sent the tweets but the court had to decide whether they would be judged \"grossly offensive\" by \"any reasonable member of society\".\n\nJohn McGregor, defending, said Perkins accepted the comments expressed in the tweets were \"sick\" and he had not tried to hide them.\n\nBut he said it fell to the court to be the \"moral arbiter\" of what was said.\n\nPerkins, of Chelmsley Wood in the west Midlands, was arrested on March 13 and told police he had been \"encouraged\" to post the tweets by those around him at the game.\n\nHe said he had drunk nine pints of lager - starting at 7am on the day of the noon kick-off.\n\nBut he told the court his actions had been \"wrong\" and he had \"great respect\" for Grealish, who he described as a \"great footballer\".\n\nPerkins said he had not intended to offend the footballer and had not sent the tweets to him or tagged him in them.\n\nHe said he had been banned from Blues matches for life and had written to Grealish to apologise.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nPerkins said: \"I had nine pints, I started at 7am and the kick off was 12pm.\n\n\"The pubs in the city centre opened at 7am that day.\"\n\nHe said he found the picture of Grealish's brother's gravestone on social media and described it as \"banter with friends\".\n\nMr McGregor told the court the teenager was just \"reacting to what was going on\" at the match.\n\n\"He hasn't conducted a hate campaign against Grealish,\" he said.\n\n\"This was just 90 minutes of stupidity, but the tweet spread like wildfire, he never intended to put it beyond his group of friends.\"\n\nPerkins was fined \u00a3120, ordered to pay \u00a3200 court costs and a \u00a330 victim surcharge.\n\nThe chairwoman of the bench said magistrates had taken into account his \"age and immaturity\" and the fact he'd been drinking.\n\nShe told him: \"I think being banned from life from watching your favourite football team is a punishment in itself.\"", "description": "Alfie Perkins, 19, directed shocking messages at Jack Grealish after downing nine pints of beer before watching Aston Villa play Birmingham City derby in March", "authors": ["Andy Richardson", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584622.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Alfie-Perkins3JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
