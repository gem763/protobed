So his opposition to Johnson, who headlined 2016 Brexit campaign, is not surprising. But it is unusual for British prime ministers from the same party to challenge each other so directly.\n\nThe case is testing the outer limits of Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution and the balance of power among the executive, legislature and judiciary.\n\n\u201cNone of this is easy,\u201d Brenda Hale, the president of the Supreme Court, told the courtroom. She promised a ruling \u201cearly next week.\u201d\n\nThe high court was called in for an emergency session to weigh contrasting judgments over Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament until mid-October. Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, though a withdrawal deal remains elusive.\n\nA Scottish court ruled that Johnson\u2019s suspension was an \u201cegregious\u201d overreach that aimed to thwart the legislature\u2019s ability to scrutinize the government\u2019s Brexit plans. An English court dismissed a related case, saying that it was a political matter and not one for the courts to decide.\n\nIf the Supreme Court finds Johnson acted unlawfully \u2014 and essentially mislead the queen when he requested her approval \u2014 it is possible lawmakers could return almost immediately to work.\n\nOn Thursday, however, speaking in Wiltshire, England, Johnson would not rule out suspending Parliament again if he lost the case.\n\nThe three-day hearing \u2014 streamed live \u2014 has been by turns unprecedented, impenetrable, important and a bit testy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Aidan O\u2019Neill, a lawyer representing 70-plus lawmakers who launched a case against Johnson\u2019s shutdown, told the judges not to let \u201cthe mother of Parliaments be shut down by the father of lies.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill called Johnson\u2019s government \u201cunworthy of our trust.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Richard Keen, a lawyer for the government, called the charges against Johnson \u201cdiscourteous, incendiary and wholly unwarranted.\u201d\n\nKeen warned the judges against wading into an \u201cill-defined minefield.\u201d\n\nJohnson did not provide the court an explanation for his decision \u2014 which Major said was \u201cconspicuous.\u201d\n\nJohnson has said publicly that the suspension was necessary to prepare a new legislative agenda. It\u2019s normal for a government to do that, but the length of the break is usually measured in days, not weeks.\n\nMajor suggested the court would be \u201cartificially naive\u201d to believe what\u2019s in the public record.\n\nJohnson was less directly challenged this week by former Conservative prime minister David Cameron. In his new memoir, Cameron said Johnson acted \u201cappallingly\u201d and misled voters on Brexit.\n\nRead more\n\nGolden rule broken?
