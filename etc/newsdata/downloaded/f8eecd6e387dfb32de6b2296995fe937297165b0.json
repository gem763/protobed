I felt like I could never turn it around.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, I didn\u2019t grow up in a stable home, my parents were 18 [and] separated with no money, still young and rebellious, as well,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs my talent progressed and I became ultra-successful, it happened within a strand of two years.
