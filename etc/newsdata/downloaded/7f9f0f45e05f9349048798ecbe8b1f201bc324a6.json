Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- reported, according to The Hill.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE: BIDEN CAMPAIGN 'NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED' ABOUT CASH WOES\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,\u201d a campaign fundraising email for Biden said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.\u201d\n\nLess cash on hand means the campaign will struggle to respond to \u201ctwists and turns of this race \u2014 and with Donald Trump constantly pushing his false smear campaign against Joe, that\u2019s a HUGE problem,\u201d the letter says.\n\nThe letter closes with an appeal, according to The Hill.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to fall behind, so I\u2019m asking you to step up now and make a donation to fuel our campaign.\"\n\nDemocratic operative Michael Ceraso said Biden's cash flow could dry up \"as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.\"\n\nBiden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren\u2019s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash \u2013 was a much more modest 76 percent.\n\nThe 76-year-old former vice president started off as a solid frontrunner in the polls, but more recent surveys have shown Warren either catching up or surpassing him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFEC filings show Warren has $25.7 million in cash on hand and Sanders has $33.7 million.\n\nFox News' Joshua Nelson contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign sent a fundraising\u00a0email this week, claiming it hasn't raised as much money as its competitors after spending more than expected in the third quarter, according to a report.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/17/694940094001_6095517179001_6095513885001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
