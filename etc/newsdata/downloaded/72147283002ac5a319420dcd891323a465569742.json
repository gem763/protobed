Why your pooch might need a gluten and dairy free diet", "language": "en", "text": "Just like humans, no two dogs are ever the same. And increasingly, our understanding of people\u2019s different dietary needs is creating a similar awareness of problems our dogs might have.\n\nFor an owner, there is nothing quite as upsetting as seeing your best friend under the weather or anything less than their loving, vivacious selves; particularly because they can't tell you what's wrong.\n\nAnd from dairy intolerance to gluten allergies, our dogs can get the same tummy troubles from foods that we do, so making the right choices for their mealtimes can make a big difference.\n\nThat\u2019s why British brand Butcher\u2019s have tailored their food for dogs to suit every type of dog and their many different nutritional needs.\n\nFrom dairy intolerance to gluten allergies, our dogs can get the same tummy troubles as we do\n\n\u2018Different dogs require different nutrients,\u2019 explains Dr Lucy Williamson a registered nutritionist who discovered the importance of a healthy doggy diet during her time as a vet. \u2018But it\u2019s much harder to spot a problem with what our pets are eating than allergens in our own diets.\n\nButcher\u2019s Head of Brand, Kim Burgess agrees, saying: 'Food intolerance for dogs is very easily overlooked - but just like humans, dogs are sensitive to different foods.\n\n'But as a dog its hard to speak up and inform your owner why or in what way you feel unwell. However there are indicators of a problem owners can look out for. Your dog having diarrhea is a good indicator but allergies can also affect skin and coats. If unsure go to your vet as a blood test will quickly diagnose the issues.'\n\n\u2018The most common symptoms for dogs tend to be repeated ear infections and chewing at the paws,' Dr Lucy concurs. 'In these cases, the underlying cause may be a hypersensitivity to something in their food, such as gluten.'\n\nBut we don\u2019t need to be clean-eating experts ourselves to find the specialist diet our best friends deserve.\n\nMany of Butcher's recipes have always been and always will be naturally 100% grain-free, so they provide wholesome nutrition for all dogs, even those with sensitive tummies\n\nEspecially when family-run business Butcher\u2019s is on a mission to nourish every dog with a complete and balanced range that\u2019s packed with natural super food ingredients, whether that\u2019s meats that come directly from British and Irish farms, vegetable or wholegrain foods.\n\n\u2018Dietary sensitivities may result in inflammatory bowel disease and poor absorption of nutrients with diarrhoea and weight loss being key symptoms,\u2019 Dr Lucy explains.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why finding the right diet to suit your dog will mean they\u2019re more likely to maintain a good weight, have a shiny, healthy coat and help to promote long-term health.\u2019\n\n'Our pets rely on us for all their nutrition and food, so at Butcher\u2019s firstly we exclude ingredients which the vets tell us are the most common problems they see with dogs and intolerances, such as pork, wheat, eggs, dairy or soya,' Kim explains.\n\n'Tailoring the diet to suit your dog will mean they\u2019re more likely to maintain a good weight, have a shiny, healthy coat and help to promote long-term health,\u2019 Dr Lucy advises\n\n'We also offer a broad range of recipes; from our naturally grain free tripe recipe to our wholegrain Lean and Tasty for those looking to achieve a healthy weight and recipes designed specifically for puppies and older dogs.'\n\nIn fact, many of Butcher's recipes have always been and always will be naturally grain-free, so they provide wholesome nutrition for all dogs, even those with sensitive tummies.\n\nIn the same way we shop for our own allergy alternatives at the supermarket, Butcher\u2019s recipes are also clearly labelled \u2018grain-free\u2019 and \u2018wholegrain\u2019 to make picking for your pet even easier.\n\nAll of Butcher's products are free of soy and wheat gluten, while many of their meals contain naturally gluten-free ingredients like wholegrain rice, which is a slow-release energy source that\u2019s easy for dogs to digest.\n\nWholegrain rice also feeds them a healthy dose of magnesium and Vitamin B6, which are vital for a whole host of functions including hormone regulation, immunity and the nervous system.\n\nButcher's Simply Gentle food for dogs is specifically designed for sensitive stomachs with added prebiotics to help support a healthy immune system\n\nCarbohydrates like sweet potato are another key ingredient in Butcher\u2019s meals because, like wholegrains, they help keep our dogs fuller for longer, as well as being high in fibre, low in fat and packed with vitamins and minerals.\n\nButcher's Simply Gentle food for dogs is specifically designed for sensitive stomachs with added prebiotics to help support a healthy immune system.\n\nAll owners know the unparalleled joy that a dog brings to your life and just how important it is to take as good care of them, as they do of us.\n\nFinding the perfect diet that works best for them is one great way to keep them fit and healthy, and bring them some of the happiness they bring us.\n\nIf you are concerned about your dog\u2019s diet, remember to consult your vet.", "description": "Just like humans, no two dogs are ever the same.
