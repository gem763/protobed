It said women with a master\u2019s or PhD degree still made one-third less over their lifetimes than men with the same qualifications.\n\nGender pay gap at its widest for women in their 50s, study reveals Read more\n\n\u201cWomen aged 26 to 35 years with higher degrees have average lifetime earnings of \u00a3803,000, whereas men of the same age with undergraduate level qualifications have average lifetime earnings of around \u00a31,160,000,\u201d said the ONS.\n\nIt said there had been a small improvement over the last 15 years: \u201cThe gap in average lifetime earnings for men and women has narrowed, with women now receiving, on average, 59% of men\u2019s average lifetime earnings; this is up from 56% in 2004.\u201d\n\nThe findings are contained in an ambitious attempt by the ONS to assess Britain\u2019s entire \u201chuman capital\u201d in financial terms. It said that even after adjusting for hours worked, women were paid about a fifth less than men over their lifetimes. \u201cTaking account the effect of weekly hours worked for men and women, women\u2019s human capital is 22.7% lower than men\u2019s,\u201d it found.\n\nMen and women tend to have the same pay in their late teens and early 20s, but after that their incomes diverge markedly. When the ONS looked at those aged 16 to 65 whose highest educational level was A-levels or equivalent, the gap peaked at the age of 48. At this point, the average male is paid \u00a316,600 more than the average female.\n\nThe ONS said the figures reflected differences in working patterns, with women\u2019s lifetime earnings lower as many more worked part-time. In separate analysis this year, the ONS said the gender pay gap for 18- to 39-year-olds who worked full time had fallen to \u201cclose to zero\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrom the age of 40 years, it widens. For all employees, the gender pay gap widens after the age of 30 years and this coincides with an increase in working part time from this age. A negative gender pay gap among part-time employees emerges in the age group 30 to 39 years before reversing by the age of 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe ONS said gender pay gap figures did not show differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs, as they were affected by factors such as the proportion of men and women working part time or in different occupations. \u201cFor example, a higher proportion of women work in occupations such as administration and caring, which tend to offer lower salaries,\u201d it said.\n\nThe figures come as one of the BBC\u2019s most prominent female presenters, Samira Ahmed, is taking the broadcaster to an employment tribunal over claims she was paid less than male colleagues for doing equivalent work, in a landmark case against the corporation.\n\nGemma Rosenblatt of the Fawcett Society, one of the most vigorous campaign groups on the gender pay gap, said: \u201cThe cumulative impact of the gender pay gap leaves women with a significantly lower lifetime income and pension pot than men - this simply isn\u2019t fair.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMore needs to be done to tackle the gender pay gap and its causes. Gender Pay Gap Reporting is helpful but it needs to go further. It\u2019s time for action not excuses. Government needs to require employers to publish action plans setting out how they will close their gender pays and monitor progress. There should be meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply.\u201d\n\nThe lower lifetime earnings of women translates into lower pensions. Separate research by financial advisers Salisbury House Wealth found that women in the UK last year received less than half the investment income received by men.\n\nIt found that women received an average of \u00a312 a week from investment income in 2017/18, compared to \u00a328 for men. It said that the total occupational pensions income for a man was \u00a3111 a week compared with \u00a371 for a woman.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Figures lay bare scale of UK pay gap, revealing huge gulf even among most highly qualified", "authors": ["Patrick Collinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5a0c65785b69ceb81d1e7fde7f4b82bc7ff985b/0_205_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08697284141545971299c87e548fbdb7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
