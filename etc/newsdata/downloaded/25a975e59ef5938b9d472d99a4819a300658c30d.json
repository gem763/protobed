However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nIf you ask me, no kitchen is complete without an iconic KitchenAid stand mixer perched atop the counter. For all the amateur bakers, professional chefs, and everyone in between, you likely recognize this machine instantly, and if you're lucky enough to own one, you know how easy it makes cooking tasks like kneading dough, mixing batter, and shredding meat. If you've always wanted a KitchenAid, right now happens to be a great time to buy because two adorable colors just dropped in price on Amazon.\n\nAmazon is currently selling the KitchenAid 6-Quart Stand Mixer in Cobalt Blue and Majestic Yellow for just $280, which is more than $100 off its usual price tag of $400 for these more rare colors. The lowest price we've ever seen for the 6-quart version is $259, so this is a solid deal and one we likely won't see again until Black Friday. Of course, if you want yours before Thanksgiving to help you prep a big meal, you may not want to wait for another sale.\n\nThe KitchenAid is known far and wide for its ability to expertly blend ingredients as well as its multi-functional features. We at Reviewed especially love the best stand mixer for its diverse set of attachments, which are both easy to clean and use. This one is also a bowl-lift mixer, which is preferred to the head tilt-head versions as it's more sturdy and easier to maneuver. The 6-quart model can whip up batter for 13 dozen cookies in a single batch, so that should tell you just how powerful this bad boy actually is.\n\nThe KitchenAid stand mixer will no doubt be a hot commodity this holiday season, so now's a great time to scoop one up to help with all your pie making. Whether it's a gift for the baker in your life, or you're just looking to treat yourself, we think this sale is pretty off the hook, pun intended.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
