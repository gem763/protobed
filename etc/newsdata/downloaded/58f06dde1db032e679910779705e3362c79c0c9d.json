But it isn\u2019t all about having a savings account\n\nYou never go to Pret \u2026 and 24 other signs you\u2019ve reached financial maturity\n\nA new survey, by the lender Zopa, has revealed that British people don\u2019t reach financial maturity until the age of 31. At 22 we are apparently most frivolous with our money \u2013 overspending on holidays and nights out \u2013 but by our early 30s we tend to take better control of our finances. The survey comes complete with a list of signs that you have reached financial maturity \u2013 you have a savings account and a pension, for example \u2013 but it\u2019s by no means comprehensive. So here\u2019s a better list.\n\n1. You can check your banking app without having a 45-minute full-body palpitation.\n\n2. You can receive a brown envelope in the post without automatically assuming HMRC is planning to throw you in prison.\n\n3. You make your own lunch every day, ideally from things you have scavenged from a neighbour\u2019s bin.\n\n4. You can walk past an estate agent\u2019s window without having a tantrum about the impossibility of home ownership.\n\n5. You don\u2019t buy anything until you have searched the entire internet for the best deal.\n\n6. You shun holidays in favour of closing your eyes and thinking about holidays \u2013 basically the same thing.\n\n7. You refuse to lend your friends cash, preferring instead to deliver a quick motivational address about the power of aspiration.\n\n8. You can read literature from a bank or insurance company without glazing over like a shop mannequin.\n\n9. Your pension plan doesn\u2019t revolve around you dying in a suspiciously timed skydiving accident on the eve of your 70th birthday.\n\n10. You have incredibly rich parents.\n\n11. You shun all the latest expensive fashions, such as trendy clothes and dentistry.\n\n12. You have an emergency fund that does not solely consist of \u20ac23 and a Twix.\n\n13. You can be told your credit rating without asking anyone whether it\u2019s good or not.\n\n14. You know how much money is in your account at all times, but not because your bank keeps sending you panicky texts about the payments it is having to refuse.\n\n15. You have incredibly rich parents.\n\n16. You\u2019ve realised that friends are ultimately a financial burden, and so spend all your nights in silent pitch-black solitude.\n\n17. You have home insurance.\n\n18. You have life insurance.\n\n19. You have life insurance that doesn\u2019t constantly act as a terrifying reminder that you are worth several times more to your loved ones dead than alive.\n\n20. You cook your dinners in batches to save money, because eating shepherd\u2019s pie every night is actually quite underrated.\n\n21. You can look your children in the eye without wondering how much you would get if you harvested their organs on the black market.\n\n22. You spent your entire childhood dreaming of the day when you could become a cackling unscrupulous private landlord.\n\n23. You have never bought an avocado, for you know that a supermarket avocado represents the highest possible level of insane decadence.\n\n24. You haven\u2019t been to a Pret in eight years.\n\n25. You have incredibly rich parents. I know that this is the third time I\u2019ve mentioned this, but, well, it definitely seems to help.", "description": "According to a new survey, British people aren\u2019t fully financially mature until the age of 31.
