Moreno, who declared a state of emergency over the nationwide protests last Thursday, has moved government headquarters to the coastal city of Guayaquil.\n\nA week of protests against the fuel price hike has slashed the South American country\u2019s oil output by a third.\n\nOil production fell 31 percent after the seizure of three oil facilities in the Amazon, the energy ministry said Tuesday.\n\nProduction losses at the state-owned Petroamazonas \u201cwill reach 165,000 barrels per day,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Ecuador, which exited the OPEC international oil cartel last week citing economic constraints, normally produces 531,000 barrels per day.\n\nMoreno\u2019s declaration emergency declaration failed to deter the advance of indigenous protesters who have repeatedly clashed with security forces on their journey to the capital from the far reaches of the country.\n\nMoreno on Tuesday tried to head off Wednesday\u2019s planned protest by offering to hold talks with \u201cthe indigenous brothers.\u201d\n\nHe added that income from the elimination of fuel subsidies would be spent \u201con the poorest.\u201d\n\nAddressing the nation on Monday as the scale of the crisis affecting his country began to unfold, Moreno had accused his predecessor and ex-ally Rafael Correa along with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of an \u201cattempted coup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nThey were using \u201cindigenous groups, taking advantage of their mobilization to plunder and destroy,\u201d he charged.\n\nMoreno\u2019s accusation drew support Tuesday from seven Latin American countries, rejecting \u201cany action\u201d by Maduro and his allies to \u201cdestabilize\u201d Ecuador.\n\n\u201cThe governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru and Paraguay, express their resounding rejection of any destabilizing attempt of legitimately constituted democratic regimes and express their strong support for the actions undertaken\u201d by Moreno, according to a joint statement issued by the Colombian government.\n\nAll seven countries have right-wing governments that see Moreno\u2019s moderate socialist administration as an important regional ally against Venezuela.\n\n\u2013 Call for early election \u2013\n\nCorrea meanwhile called for early elections, citing \u201cserious social upheaval,\u201d while denying Moreno\u2019s accusations that he was fomenting a coup.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no coup here. Conflicts in democracy are resolved at the polls,\u201d the Belgium-based Correa said in a video published on social media.\n\nCorrea, who was president of the Andean nation from 2007-17, is wanted in his homeland on suspicion of ordering the kidnapping of a political opponent while he was president.\n\nSome 20,000 protesters were due to arrive in the capital by Wednesday, according to indigenous umbrella organization CONAIE.\n\nThousands had already reached the capital on Monday and camped in parks or occupied buildings.\n\nThe country has been rocked by days of demonstrations after increases of up to 120 percent in fuel prices came into force on October 3.\n\nThey have so far left one civilian dead and 77 people injured, the majority of them security forces, the government said. A total of 477 people have been detained.\n\nMoreno scrapped fuel subsidies as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to obtain loans despite Ecuador\u2019s high public debt.\n\nThe subsidies were costing the government $1.3 billion a year.\n\nThe IMF agreement, signed in March, allowed Ecuador to borrow $4.2 billion.", "description": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 Police and demonstrators clashed Tuesday at Ecuador\u2019s Congress building as protests over a fuel hike introduced by President", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/c5f2be_demonstrators-national-assembly-in-quito-clashes-riot-police-clashes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
