But Americans didn\u2019t begin using the phrase with any frequency until the 1940s, when Edward Mead Earle, a historian based at Princeton\u2019s Institute for Advanced Study from the 1930s to the \u201850s, helped popularize the concept among policy elites and ordinary Americans alike.\n\nBefore then, many military planners and civilian leaders spoke of \u201cnational defense.\u201d But that phrase referred to matters of war only. Unlike us, they had no concept that linked together so many disparate policy domains, from information and infrastructure to terrorism and trade. The rise of \u201cnational security\u201d has since helped expand the power of government, defy the very idea of peacetime, and reorganize much of modern life.\n\nRead: Is America any safer?\n\nCambridge historian Andrew Preston has counted sitting U.S. presidents publicly mentioning \u201cnational security\u201d a mere four times between 1918 and 1931\u2014an average of one utterance for each of the presidents who served during that period. It\u2019s also fewer than the number of times I wrote \u201cnational security\u201d in the opening paragraph of this article.\n\nEarle didn\u2019t coin the phrase. Nor was he alone during the so-called \u201cworld crisis\u201d of the 1930s and \u201940s in advocating for a more aggressive military and foreign policy. But he was one of the first to develop a full-fledged theory of national security, which he then sold to the country. Speaking in 1940 before a New York auditorium crowded with academics, military men, and journalists, Earle claimed the term \u201cdefense\u201d to be \u201cmisleading.\u201d The term implied a passive and reactive position\u2014one of \u201cwaiting until the enemy is at one\u2019s gates.\u201d But this amounted to suicide in an age of totalitarianism and air power, which gave the advantage to the aggressor. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Earle said to the audience, \u201ca better word is security.\u201d\n\nThe Great Depression and world wars proved that the modern international system was precarious, capable of collapse. But, in Earle\u2019s eyes, while interwar Americans had blithely placed their faith in stability, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan made no such mistake. They prepared for war, engaging in a vast mobilization effort that subsumed under military preparedness everything, Earle once wrote, \u201cfrom the birth-rate to the most delicate mechanism of the national economy.\u201d And in their conduct with other nations, military concerns now dominated diplomacy, instead of vice versa. While Earle didn\u2019t call for copying and pasting totalitarianism into America, he did look to Germany\u2019s focus on security with admiration, as well as with fear. In making this case, Earle had introduced something new: a \u201cnational security imagination,\u201d as I described it in a recent paper in Diplomatic History. This new, militarized way of looking at the world transformed the economy into a geopolitical machine, distant conflicts into immediate dangers, and military preparedness into a permanent condition. It shattered the boundary between civilian and soldier, domestic and foreign, and even war and peace.", "description": "When the two-word phrase became a national obsession, it turned everything from trade rules to dating apps into a potential threat to the United States.", "authors": ["Dexter Fergie", "Ph.D. Student In History At Northwestern University"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/NSAstart_1/facebook.jpg?1569609548", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
