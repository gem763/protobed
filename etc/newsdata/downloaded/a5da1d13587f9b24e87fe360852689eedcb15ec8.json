The government warned that if its opponents sought to sink the deal with amendments then it would withdraw the vote.\n\nIf Bercow, who said on Saturday he was blindsided by the government\u2019s debate proposal, does not allow it then the government will have to try to push on with the legislation needed for ratification of Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nBut that is a path that exposes Johnson to attempts by opponents to wreck the agreement.\n\nGoldman Sachs raised the probability of the United Kingdom leaving with a ratified deal to 70% from 65%, cut its view of the chances of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit to 5% from 10% and left its view on no Brexit at all unchanged at 25%.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons as parliament discusses Brexit, sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War, in London, Britain, October 19, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video.
