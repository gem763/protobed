So the downgrade hits extra hard,\u201d Nordnet analyst Per Hansen said.\n\nCOST CUTTING\n\n\u201cNot to talk it down, but for me this is not a major setback for the industry at all,\u201d chief financial officer Wiinholt said in a conference call with media.\n\n\u201cThe industry will still grow, we are in a way more competitive than gas and coal,\u201d she added.\n\nEuropean oil majors like Total and Equinor are looking to offshore wind amid pressure from shareholders to show how they plan to align their businesses with global efforts to cut emissions.\n\nIn a bid to stay ahead as industry leader, Orsted said it would cut costs by 500-600 million crowns between 2020 and 2022, including one-off reductions and \u201creductions across our staff functions\u201d.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Orsted issued its third-quarter results report a day ahead of schedule.\n\nIt reported an 85% jump in EBITDA to 4.12 billion Danish crowns ($611.45 million), topping the 3.27 billion forecast by seven analysts in a poll provided by the company.\n\nIt maintained its outlook for the year - a target it raised in September with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) seen at 16-17 billion Danish crowns, up from a previous 15.5-16.5 billion.\n\n\u201cWe had a very strong third quarter with high wind speeds and a ramp-up generation from new wind farms,\u201d CEO Henrik Poulsen said in a statement.\n\nEarnings from wind farms in operation increased by 23% in the first nine months to 8.6 billion crowns, it said.\n\nOrsted shares were down 8.44% at 1343 GMT.", "description": "Lower output forecasts and project returns from Orsted eclipsed a jump in third-quarter profit, sending shares in the world's largest offshore wind energy developer down as much as 10% on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Nikolaj Skydsgaard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
