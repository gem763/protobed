They were designed to deal with different threats \u2013 and they were looking in the wrong direction.\n\nThe audacious strike against the Abqaiq petroleum processing facilities and Khurais oil field on Saturday morning \u2013 which the Saudis say was \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran\u201d \u2013 has exposed the limits of the defences of the world\u2019s largest military spender per capita.\n\nEverything you need to know about the Saudi Arabia oil attacks Read more\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s ability to ward off any future attacks is also constrained, analysts said, and depends heavily on Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to make a deal with Iran.\n\nLike other conventional armies across the region, Saudi Arabia\u2019s armed forces are scrambling to protect against the rise of cheap, low-tech threats such as drones. The kingdom has spent billions in recent years on US-made Patriot surface-to-air missiles designed to shoot down high-flying targets such as enemy jets or ballistic missiles. Satellite imagery suggests at least one was installed at Abqaiq in the recent past.\n\nBut drones and cruise missiles fly too low to be detected by the Patriot\u2019s ground-based radar. \u201cThey aren\u2019t threats these systems are designed to cover,\u201d said Omar Lamrani, from the strategic analysis firm Stratfor.\n\nEven if they could see the threats, experts said, Saudi Arabia\u2019s missile-defence systems \u2013 with a field of vision of about 120 degrees \u2013 would likely have been pointed across the Gulf towards Iran and south towards Yemen, but at least some of the missiles and drones are believed to have struck from the west.\n\nThe missile debris the Saudis displayed at a press conference on Wednesday evening appeared to be that of an Iranian Quds-1 missile, with a range of less than 1000km, and possibly as little as 500km, said Michael Elleman, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cThus, it seems more probable that they were launched from either Iraq or Iran territory, but certainly not Yemen,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least four shorter-range defence systems, designed to take out smaller targets, were also present around Abqaiq, according to satellite images. But they were either positioned at the wrong end of the facility or would have seen the tiny drones and missiles too late to shoot them down, said Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Monterey-based Centre for Nonproliferation Studies.\n\n\u201cThis attack was something new, it was not something the Saudis were expecting to happen,\u201d said Lamrani.\n\nThe US shares intelligence with Saudi Arabia, but that also has its own limitations, according to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Joseph Dunford. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an unblinking eye over the entire Middle East at all times,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe Saudi reaction was also hampered by the organisation of its own forces, said Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the Rand Corporation. Most US defence sales have gone to the Saudi military, but the country\u2019s oil infrastructure falls under the responsibility of the interior ministry, which has traditionally focused on domestic threats. Meanwhile, separate air defences are operated by the National Guard.\n\nOther crucial Saudi infrastructure such as the plants which cleanse Saudi drinking water, and the long pipelines that carry them to major cities, also now look vulnerable. \u201cAll these installations are very large and above ground,\u201d said Eckart Woertz, a senior research fellow at the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs.\n\n\u201cThis attack was about Iran demonstrating that it has the means and will to execute exquisitely precise attacks on the most vital oil infrastructure in the world by far,\u201d said Robert McNally, a former national security adviser to George W Bush, and now president of the Rapidan Energy Group. \u201cAnd they can come back next Tuesday or a week from Friday \u2013 they can do this again.\u201d\n\nIn its response, Riyadh will seek to avoid anything that might trigger a wider conflict, analysts said \u2013 especially if it cannot rely on American support. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s air force has some capabilities but is very much reliant on the US for ammunition, refuelling and reconnaissance,\u201d said Woertz.\n\n\u201cIn terms of boots on the ground, their capabilities are more limited. They don\u2019t have many soldiers within Yemen, they rely on mercenaries.\u201d\n\nTrump has made it clear in recent days that he is averse to following Saudi Arabia into a full-blown confrontation. \u201cThe president has made it clear he is not looking to go to war,\u201d Dunford said in London on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we saw was an unacceptable act of aggression [and] here are a number of ways to deal with that.\u201d\n\nComplicating the situation for Riyadh is that it has no way to de-escalate the standoff itself. Iran\u2019s demand is that crippling sanctions on its exports be lifted \u2013 something only the United States can grant.\n\n\u201cBut the escalation path is also very dangerous for Saudi Arabia because it exposes their energy infrastructure to retaliatory strikes by Iran,\u201d said Lamrani.\n\nDrone attacks in Middle East raise fears of escalating conflict Read more\n\nThe attack has put a diplomatic breakthrough between the US and Iran out of reach in the short term. More likely, said analysts, was a limited military response, delicately calibrated to deter Iran from raising the bar again without sparking an all-out conflict.\n\n\u201cA proportional, limited response would look like the Saudi armed forces, or the US armed forces, or both, firing a volley of cruise missiles \u2026 against the facilities or the territory where these attacks originated,\u201d said McNally.\n\n\u201cIt would be a symbolic strike that is directly proportional,\u201d said Lamrani. \u201cYou struck our most important oil facility, and so we\u2019re striking yours, and then we\u2019re backing down.\u201d", "description": "Escalation is dangerous because infrastructure could be exposed to retaliation", "authors": ["Michael Safi", "Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2adfcfea076dd3c1f344c56fff18b28f5492d372/0_3_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=07f9f5581264b58f0db4ef1437429ca0", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
