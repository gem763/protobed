It will run from November 25th through January 2nd although some of the seasonal hires will stay on for a few more weeks.\n\n\u201cThe big question is will they come through and hire the full quantity of labor estimated by the company,\u201d Brusuelas says.\n\nUPS is expected to provide holiday shipping projections during its Q3 earnings call October 23rd.\n\nA UPS employee delivering parcels.

Today she is UPS\u2019s domestic president of human resources.\n\n\u201cAnd for me coming from a small town like Johnstown Pennsylvania I\u2019d never imagine these opportunities,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCusker Rees has had several different careers at UPS working in business development, communications, and operations.\n\nUPS employs 380,000 people in the United States a third of them, like McCusker Rees, started as seasonal workers.\n\nDanelle McCusker Rees, UPS President of Human Resources for Domestic U.S. Operations, started as a part time seasonal employee. More\n\nAlthough the seasonal hires work roughly two months, UPS says 35% continue to work part time becoming what the company calls permanent part time employees. McCusker Rees says, \u201cOne in every three UPSers that we have, has had that exact experience.\u201d\n\nSome are attracted to UPS\u2019s Earn and Learn program which provides up to $5250 a year in tuition reimbursement and a lifetime max of $25,000 for permanent UPS employees.\n\nMcCusker Rees says the seasonal hires are eligible for a portion of that money too. UPS on average provides $1300 in tuition reimbursement to seasonal hires.\n\nIt\u2019s a good incentive according to McCusker Rees who never thought should we work full time at UPS.\n\n\u201cI can honestly say no, I didn\u2019t realize, I was a college kid that was looking for a position to bring in some holiday cash and also maybe give me some internship credits,\u201d she said. The delivery company appears to have delivered for her.\n\nReserve your ticket to AMS!
