The sentence has only just been made public.\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Grundy shortly after he vanished in a neighbour\u2019s stolen car following the June 13, 2017 stabbing.\n\nThe victim had a life-saving operation to remove a large kitchen knife from her lower back.\n\nHer daughter alerted police after finding her lying in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor.\n\n(Image: SOLARPIX.COM)\n\nGrundy, who worked as a taxi driver and gardener, is believed to have been sleeping in the vehicle he was using to avoid capture.\n\nClothes and \u20ac4,600 (\u00a34,020) were found inside the car.\n\nJuan Carlos Moragues, a central government representative for the Alicante area, confirmed at the time an international arrest warrant was out for Mr Grundy and revealed he had fled the crime scene in a stolen car belonging to neighbours whose house he looked after, leaving his own vehicle where it was.\n\nCourt documents revealed ahead of the trial, which was set to last just one day if it had gone ahead as scheduled, said: \u201cA man is due to be tried for trying to kill a woman he had been in a relationship with for a few months.\n\n(Image: SOLARPIX.COM)\n\n\u201cThe incident happened on June 13, 2017 at the victim\u2019s home on an estate in Orihuela, when both had an argument which state prosecutors say was caused by his jealousy.\n\n\u201cThe woman asked him to leave home because she needed time to think but he insisted on continuing the relationship and trying to kiss her and talk to her.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, when the victim was in the bathroom getting ready to go out, he approached her from behind and stabbed her once in the lower back.\n\n\u201cThen he sat her on the floor and left the property. The victim managed to drag herself to the garden to ask her mum and daughter, who were outside waiting for her, for help.\u201d", "description": "David Grundy, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, has been jailed in Spain over stabbing his partner Nicola Anne Walker Houghton at their expat home", "authors": ["Gerard Couzens", "Image", "Solarpix.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668188.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-190617-Fugitive-Brit-ex-pat-53-who-stabbed-his-partner-in-the-back-at-their-Spanish-home-is.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
