They talk about feeling isolated from their new coursemates, how the weather is stunningly (or terribly) different, and how the food, or the people, aren\u2019t what they used to. As someone who moved from the UK to Hong Kong fifteen months ago, I can tell you it\u2019s the same discombobulating feeling the other way around too.\n\nI\u2019m a proper English northerner. I like my pies swimming in gravy. I\u2019m an expert at dressing for summer - we don\u2019t have one - and I\u2019m surprised my feet aren\u2019t more webbed than they are, with the rain we seem to live in. But I\u2019m also Chinese. And as much as I was raised in a mainly white, working-class town \u201coop North\u201d, I was also taught to light incense for the dead. I never stick my chopsticks upright in my rice bowl. I try to remember which of my aunties is my ah yee, and which is my kau mo. Please note: try. I\u2019m not always successful.\n\nWhen circumstances in my life a few years back allowed me to move to Hong Kong and experience first-hand my family\u2019s roots, I took it. I quit my old job, sold or gave away almost everything I had bought for my rented flat in Yorkshire and left, with enough money to tide me over for three months as I looked for a job. Wild, right? I should probably add that I was staying with relatives for the first few months, and I always knew that if nothing else, I\u2019d be able to find a job in the 852 teaching English.\n\nTen years ago, if you\u2019d asked me whether I imagined I could do something like this - move halfway across the world on a bit of a whim, and leave behind a steady, comfortable (if, let\u2019s be real, a bit of a boring) life - I\u2019d have laughed in your face. I know the sort of person I am. A bit of a stick-in-the-mud. More than a little scared of the world. Terrified of embarrassing myself in front of people, of having them judging me for what I say, or do, or think.\n\nIf you ask my family, my friends back home, or my old teachers and classmates, they\u2019d tell you I\u2019m a good, reliable sort. I\u2019m dependable, and responsible. Which is great and all, but no-one actually wants to be known for being \u2026 well, any of those things.. \u201cCool\u201d, \u201camazing\u201d, and \u201cfun\u201d - that\u2019s what you want to hear. I don\u2019t know about you, but the person I could sort of see myself being, the one in my head, was infinitely cooler. And taller. Definitely taller.\n\nThat person in my head has never been anything more than a pipe dream. I\u2019m really, honestly, not the sort of person that even dips their toe outside of their comfort zone. Or I wasn\u2019t, I guess? Here\u2019s the thing. That was me for most of my life. And then suddenly I did something so far left-field, I think my head's still spinning, 15 months later. What happened? Who is this person who booked a plane ticket with no return? Am I even the same person I\u2019ve been for 20-*mumble* years?\n\nThe short answer is yes, of course I\u2019m still me. Who else could I be, or want to be? The long answer \u2026 well, that might take a little longer to figure out. But maybe I\u2019m both, right? The person I am now - a little braver, a little more willing to take risks - is also the person who would really rather stay in her little old routine back in England. Or maybe I\u2019m looking too far into something that\u2019s not really there. But if there\u2019s one thing to take away from my ramble, make it this: the person you are now is the best version of yourself - for now. Tomorrow, you\u2019ll be even better. No-one actually stops developing - what you can\u2019t fathom doing now, you might be able to do with ease in the future. You might not be comfortable in your skin right now (loads of people aren\u2019t), but tomorrow you might be.\n\nOr, if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll understand this revelation 10 years down the line and half a world away. Whatever.\n\n\u200bAND I\u2019m still not any taller.\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "Think about the person you were 10 years ago, and you\u2019ll realise that the person you\u2019ll be 10 years from now will be completely different.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_205757131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
