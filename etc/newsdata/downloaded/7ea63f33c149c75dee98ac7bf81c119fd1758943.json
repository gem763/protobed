Here's what to do", "language": "en", "text": "Next Story : Indian women are running up a storm!\n\nHe\u2019s your confidante and your voice of reason. He cracks a joke; you snigger and smack the back of his head. You know you can count on him and he\u2019s the only one who can uplift your spirits. And in one Eureka moment, you realise you\u2019ve not only fallen for him, but also run the risk of ruining the friendship because he may not see you the same way. Having feelings for your best friend can be maddening! The frustration of not being able to embrace your emotions only makes it worse. \u201cYou have to be careful and analytical in such situations. Before taking any step, ask yourself whether it really is a good match?\u201d asks Dr Shefali Batra, senior consultant psychiatrist and cognitive therapist, founder of Mindframes and co-founder of Innerhour. We\u2019re here to help. Read on to explore a four-point plan you can follow.Is there a spark? People often read into situations that are non-existent, thanks to the rose-coloured glasses they slip on every time they have a crush. In this case, the risk of losing a friend is real and must be taken into consideration. While the concept of chemistry might be different for all, there are common signs that are suggestive of it. Dialogues laced with slightly sexual quips, double entendres, romantic connotations, and subtle expressions of what it might be like if the two of you met in a different scenario, along with slight physical contact are all indications that there is chemistry from the other side as well. Based on these signs you will know whether or not to go ahead and pursue this person, says Dr Batra.Find ways to engage through conversation. It need not be openly flirtatious; it could be as simple as discussing your favourite flavour of ice cream or a movie, advises Dr Batra. Compliment him, but be sincere. If the conversation flows and he responds to your subtle flirting positively, the ball is in your court. \u201cIn my experience, chatting over dinner was quite insightful. We discussed dating, kicking off with ridiculous dates we\u2019ve experienced to understanding his perspective on love. The secret lies in gently toeing the line backed up by good conversation and subtle flirting. It\u2019s what helped my current boyfriend and I transform a healthy friendship into a healthy romance.\u201d shares Kavya Gunani, a 26-year-old IT professional from Gurgaon.A gentle reminder: Focus on yourself. Don\u2019t obsess over your crush or let your feelings consume you. While taking up a spin class or grabbing a drink with your pals are superficial distractions and we encourage them; remind yourself that it\u2019s not real until both parties are equally invested. What\u2019s the point of fretting until then? Let things unravel naturally. Don\u2019t make yourself available all the time. Leave him to stew in his own thoughts after you\u2019ve subtly shown interest. It just might intrigue him. Allow him to discover what it feels like to miss you. Intervals of space will give him the opportunity to appreciate your presence when you two do decide to hang out. Dr Seema Hingorany, independent clinical psychologist and author, \u201cFocus on your own life goals and avoid behaving desperate and clingy. Work on your obsessive patterns if any. Clinginess is a major turn off for most men and it robs you of your dignity.\u201d Self-respect is key.It\u2019s time to let him know how you feel about him. The turmoil that comes with denying your feelings is far greater than that of putting yourself out there. So let it out. Communicate your feelings and be open about your intentions. Being candid instead of playing mind games is refreshing. Put your cards on the table for him to see; being vulnerable in such situations doesn\u2019t translate to being weak. But know where to draw the line. \u201cI shared a very special bond with my best friend who I liked romantically. But being in the middle of a one-sided romance can be disquieting.I chose to isolate from him for a while to get my bearings. I was gradually able to move on; time fixes everything.\u201d says Rochelle D\u2019souza, a 28-year-old dentist living in Mumbai. \u201cBe clear that you\u2019re looking for a relationship, and if he isn\u2019t ready then he\u2019s not for you. Don\u2019t waste your time if being his \u2018friend\u2019 feels like you\u2019re actually just an emotional sounding board.\u201d If it works, there\u2019s nothing like it. Take it slow and let the romance blossom naturally. If he doesn\u2019t feel the same way, it\u2019s time to take a step back. Affections cannot be forced. It\u2019s a mark of maturity to accept the reality of the situation and move on. Take some time off from his company if you feel the need to. Always remember, it\u2019s not the end of the world. There are plenty of fish in the sea; take the plunge when you\u2019re ready again.123rf", "description": "While the feeling is tempting, it can get exasperating soon enough.
