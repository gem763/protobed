Gavin Newsom and is the state\u2019s primary response to the massive blazes that have ravaged communities across the state.\n\nHowever, an emerging body of scientific research on patterns of homes destroyed by fire suggests the state\u2019s approach may be ignoring one of the most crucial elements for keeping people safe and limiting wildfire ignition sources.\n\nScientists have increasingly found that loss of property and life from fire is overwhelmingly the result of precariously placed housing in and bordering wildland areas \u2014 residential developments that are, themselves, a major driver sparking conflagrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 90% of fires in California are started by humans, often along roads and buildings lined with flammable invasive grasses.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, has largely sidestepped any discussion of whether fire-prone landscapes should be off limits to new home construction.\n\nCal Fire has acknowledged that housing construction continues in and around the state\u2019s wildlands, where about 11 million people now live in 4.5 million homes.\n\nBeyond cutting and burning down natural landscapes, the state\u2019s response to the threat of wildfire has been to require that new home construction use the latest in fire-resistant materials, encourage retrofits of older structures and improve roads used as evacuation routes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe physical location of being out in the WUI [wildland-urban interface] doesn\u2019t mean that the communities will be entirely burned down like we saw in Paradise if they\u2019re built to the latest standards,\u201d said Steve Hawks, Cal Fire deputy chief overseeing the Wildland Fire Prevention Engineering Program.\n\nHawks also downplayed the idea that building new homes in and around fire-prone areas would create more ignition sources, leading to more backcountry blazes.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s growing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find that people travel, they vacation out in the WUI areas. There\u2019s a certain amount of fires that are going to happen no matter what anyone tries to do to prevent them.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions, the governor\u2019s office pointed to an often-quoted article from April by the Associated Press in which Newsom said that restricting building in high-fire areas would run counter to the state\u2019s \u201cpioneering spirit.\u201d\n\nThat position has fueled a growing frustration among wildfire researchers who have been calling for an open debate about whether and to what extent new housing should be limited in fire-prone areas, similar to restrictions in flood plains.\n\nChar Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College and widely recognized wildfire policy expert, said the state\u2019s focus on cutting down trees and scrubland is an \u201cobfuscation\u201d to take pressure off elected leaders.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no conversation other than the vegetation management conversation about what to do about wildfires,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty deliberate.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t proclaim ignorance or innocence,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have all of the information we need. What we don\u2019t have is political leadership at any level.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nState officials have countered that the focus needs to be on protecting existing communities in high-fire areas, such as by paving new evacuation routes and helping residents pay for upgrades to their homes.\n\n\u201cThe notion that this is all about how we will plan our future developments ignores the 800-pound gorilla of the built environment as it exists on the landscape today,\u201d said Keith Gilless, professor of forest economics at UC Berkeley and chairman of the state\u2019s Board of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe approval process\n\nWithout California-wide standards, local elected officials have broad discretion when it comes to approving the location of new developments. When faced with public resistance, county lawmakers overseeing wildland areas often call on regional firefighting authorities to testify to the safety of specific projects.\n\nThe San Diego County Board of Supervisors, for example, has approved thousands of units of new housing in high-fire-severity zones over the last 18 months with the support of Cal Fire. Such projects must meet a wide array of state and local requirements, such as building materials, road lengths and ensuring firefighters have access to water.\n\nThe view from Proctor Valley Road southwest of Jamul and northeast of Chula Vista on May 14, 2019.

The project is being contested by environmental groups on a number of grounds, including the potential danger posed to future residents from wildfire. (Joshua Emerson Smith / The San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nIn June, the board narrowly approved the 1,119-home Adara at Otay Ranch, planned along a two-lane road in an area routinely scorched by wildfire, including the devastating 2007 Harris Fire.\n\nScores of people gave testimony in opposition, including fire-dynamics expert and building consultant Chris Lautenberger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLautenberger, co-founder of Reax Engineering, told the board that the project not only puts residents of the new development at risk, it could exacerbate fire danger for nearby communities.\n\n\u201cBuilding 1,100 homes \u2026 greatly increases the chances of fires igniting there simply due to the presence of people, vehicles, roads and homes in what is a currently largely undeveloped area,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cUnder strong Santa Ana wind conditions, it would spread rapidly toward Chula Vista where several hundred structures would be destroyed within a few hours.\u201d\n\nThree of the board\u2019s five members voted to approve the project, pointing to the testimony of San Diego Cal Fire Unit Chief Tony Mecham, who after numerous questions by Supervisor Greg Cox agreed that the project represented a \u201cfire-safe community.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Mecham said he felt comfortable supporting the housing development because it would use the latest in fire-resistant building materials, clear away large amounts of vegetation and include the construction of a new fire station.\n\nAbout a month later, Cal Fire Fighters Local 2881, which represents about 650 Cal Fire employees in San Diego County, came out publicly in support of another controversial project, Newland Sierra, which is also located in an area designated by Cal Fire as a fire-hazard zone.\n\nApproval of such projects up and down the state \u2014 often years in the making with hundreds of millions of dollars in profit at stake for developers \u2014 has shocked and angered some environmental groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this disaster industrial complex,\u201d said Dan Silver, chief executive of the Endangered Habitats League. \u201cI thought the fire people would have been the best friends of not doing more remote building.\u201d\n\nResearch on wildfire destruction\n\nElected officials in Southern California have long maintained that identifying areas too risky to build is not realistic because even urban areas are at high risk for fire damage.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not what the science has found.\n\nA recent study out of the University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison\u2019s Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology and the U.S. Forest Service found that more than 90% of homes destroyed by fire in California are outside of urban areas.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, housing developments bordering wildland areas saw the most destruction, even compared with those more remotely located, according to the paper published July 30 in the International Journal of Wildland Fire.\n\nThe findings underscore a pattern of devastation that researchers and firefighting authorities have increasingly come to recognize. Wildland fires that threaten people and homes in California are not the result of large forest fires. They are wind-driven blazes that pepper nearby communities with blazing embers.\n\nThose firebrands get inside vents, lodge in unprotected eaves and ignite homes from the inside out. Then that fire travels house to house, often carried by nonnative vegetation planted by residents.\n\nIn fact, post-fire analysis has suggested that larger trees often play a limited role in spreading fire among wildland communities.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there were areas where just everything got torched,\u201d said Anu Kramer, coauthor of the report and a researcher at the University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison. \u201cBut it was not uncommon to see areas where the trees were still intact and the houses were gone.\u201d\n\nThis Aug. 21, 2019 photo shows burned trees surrounding the burned out remains of a home destroyed by last year\u2019s Camp Fire, in Paradise, Calif. (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press)\n\nThis was largely the case in the state\u2019s most deadly blaze, the Camp Fire, where a wind-driven fire swept through an area that had been heavily logged, dropping embers on the town of Paradise. When the smoke cleared, many trees were left standing among the rubble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really common to see post-fire neighborhoods and there\u2019s a lot of the vegetation left,\u201d said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension. \u201cYou realize, it was embers that started some of the homes on fire, and then the homes themselves generated a bunch of heat and fire that caught the neighboring homes on fire.\u201d\n\nSo why is California preparing to spend millions to cut back trees and shrubs, many of which provide habitat for native species? Cal Fire has acknowledged some of the limitations of vegetation management, but the agency maintains that cleared areas provide key staging grounds from which firefighters can battle oncoming flames.\n\nExperts have debated the merits of creating so-called fire breaks, but they generally agree that such projects require annual maintenance to ensure that ripping out native vegetation doesn\u2019t lead to the proliferation of highly flammable invasive plants.\n\nWhat is less settled is how to best protect homes from being ignited when firebrands blanket a community.\n\nMuch of the state\u2019s focus has centered on maintaining defensible space, aggressive landscaping within a 100-foot radius around a home. Of most concern is dead vegetation and tree limbs that overhang roofs.\n\nA recent Union-Tribune investigation revealed that Cal Fire faces significant challenges enforcing such rules, but the state has pledged to increase its efforts.\n\nStill, a scientific study published Sept. 2 in the journal Fire found that defensible space is one of the least important factors in determining whether a home burns in a wildfire, especially vegetation removal beyond the first 5 to 10 feet around a home.\n\nThe report analyzed an extensive Cal Fire database of more than 40,000 wildfire-exposed structures from 2013 to 2018 affected by some of the state\u2019s most destructive blazes, such as the Camp and Woolsey fires.\n\nThe research found that by far the most effective measures homeowners can take to protect homes is to install ember-resistant vents and double-pane windows and to box off eaves.\n\n\u201cWhat people are not aware of is that if you take your nice evergreen shrub and clear it away and put grass in there, you\u2019re actually making it more flammable,\u201d said coauthor Alexandra Syphard, chief scientist at Sage Insurance Holdings and one of the foremost experts on wildfire and housing in the state.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting the wrong message,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking, \u2018OK, I just need to clear away all this brush.\u2019 That\u2019s not the safest way to go about it.\u201d\n\nEmerson Smith writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune.", "description": "Researchers say continued home building in wildfire-prone areas makes big blazes more likely", "authors": ["Joshua Covers Environment", "Transportation For The San Diego Union-Tribune.
