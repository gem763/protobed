Bisrat Hadte, a 45-year-old businessman, said he was glad but the government still had much to do to improve daily life in the country of about 100 million.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister also has to work on to improve the economy and drive down the cost of living,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe Nobel Committee\u2019s decision appeared designed to encourage the peace process, echoing the 1994 peace prize shared by Israeli and Palestinian leaders and the 1993 award for moves towards reconciliation in South Africa, said Dan Smith, head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIt is a case of wanting a constructive intervention in the peace process ... to give leverage and encouragement,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now is internal for Abiy Ahmed, with Ethiopia needing to deal with the consequences of long-term violence, including three million displaced people and the need for continuing the political process.\u201d\n\nAbiy had been bookmakers\u2019 second favourite to win, behind the teenage Swedish climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg.\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD FOR ABIY\n\nAbiy, now 43, took office in April 2018 after the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn following three years of street unrest.\n\nFrom partial liberalisation of the state-controlled economy to overhauling the security forces that had helped the ruling coalition maintain a tight grip on power since 1991, the promises have raised hopes in the country and abroad.\n\nAbiy\u2019s landmark achievement to date is securing peace with neighbouring Eritrea.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Abiy - who joined the Ethiopian army in his teens and rose through the ruling EPRDF coalition over the past two decades - can reshape Ethiopia and open it up to the world from within the current system.\n\nHe faces resistance to change from vested interests within his coalition and the possibility that violence, including in June when a rogue state militia leader killed the region\u2019s state president and other top level officials, could escalate.\n\nAbiy also faces high expectations from young Ethiopians who want jobs, development, and opportunities.\n\n\u201cAs an Ethiopian actually I am very happy that the prime minister won the Nobel peace prize,\u201d said Desalegn Chane, president of the new National Movement of Amhara (NAMA) party told Reuters by phone.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still have legitimate concerns and grievances that Abiy needs to address. The political repression our people the Amhara have been suffering from has continued under Abiy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree of our party leaders are still in jail suspected of being the plotters of the June coup attempt but still haven\u2019t been formally charged,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.", "description": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for his peacemaking efforts which ended two decades of hostility with longtime enemy Eritrea.", "authors": ["Gwladys Fouche", "Terje Solsvik", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439630266&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0SP-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
