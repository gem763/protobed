It was lucky that I had one in stock as I don't believe in machine embroidery.'\n\nMaheen, who has been described Coco Chanel of the East, was responsible for three of the duchess's ensembles during the tour.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge's stylist Natasha Archer (pictured left in 2016) came across Maheen Khan's (right) designs at O'Nitaa, in London's Chelsea Green, before asking her for custom-made pieces for Kate's tour\n\nMaheen, who has been described Coco Chanel of the East, was responsible for three of the duchess's ensembles during the tour, including this teal silk chiffon kaftan that Kate sported when visiting Lahore's famed Badshahi Mosque\n\nMaheen created a bespoke blue kurta and trousers, hand embroidered in white silk and pearls, for the duchess to wear when visiting Islamabad's Model College.\n\n'It was quite simple as I was given a brief but allowed the freedom to create what I thought would be appropriate,' she revealed.\n\n'They didn't give me any firm directions - they gave me a brief and left it to me. I chose an existing graphic for the neckline embroidery.\n\n'I was very taken with her wedding dress: it was simple and beautiful. She has a long swan-like neck, like a ballerina. So, when they asked me to do a bespoke outfit, I instinctively created a neckline like her wedding dress.'\n\nMaheen then created a bespoke blue kurta and trousers for the duchess to wear when visiting Islamabad's Model College (pictured right), and a pair of slim-white trousers for her meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan (left)\n\nThe kurta (pictured) is a long loose-fitting collarless shirt, with the style originating in India. The clothing has its roots in Central Asian nomadic tunics\n\nAnd Kate turned to the award-winning designer, who has worked on the 1984 TV extravaganza Jewel in the Crown and musical The Phantom of the Opera, throughout the remainder of the five-day trip.\n\nThe royal teamed an emerald green tunic coat by British favourite Catherine Walker with a pair of slim-white trousers by Maheen when meeting Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\nAnd, for a visit to Lahore's famed Badshahi Mosque, she chose a teal silk chiffon kaftan, matching slim trousers and dupatta, embroidered with gold silk phulkari, or flower work, to resemble the hills of Northern Pakistan.\n\n'You cannot begin to imagine my excitement,' Maheen explained. 'I had no idea when or if at all she would wear any of them, so it was nothing short of a suspense movie. I was like a kid in a candy store.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during a visit to the Margallah Hills on the second day of the royal visit to Pakistan\n\nFor her visit to Lahore's Badshahi Mosque, Kate chose a teal silk chiffon kaftan from the designer, embroidered with gold silk flower work to resemble the hills of Northern Pakistan\n\n'You could not have moved me from the television with a roller coaster. The Duchess looked so gorgeous, relaxed and comfortable.\n\n'The periwinkle blue had hit all the right spots. And the teal chiffon, with its soft flowing silhouette was so perfect for the mosque visit.'\n\nMaheen began her career as a costume designer in 1972, working for a series of international theatrical and television productions including Sweeney Todd, Elizabeth and Elizabeth: The Golden Age.\n\nShe is the CEO of Pakistan's Fashion Week, where she shows her collections, and has also held a fashion show at Milan Fashion Week.\n\n'When I started out 10 years ago, that's the one thing I said was my goal: that I was going to dress the royals,' she added. 'It's unbelievable how it all turned around.\n\nMaheen (pictured right) said it was a 'dream come true' to make clothes for Kate and to meet her and Prince William at an intimate reception (left) in Islamabad during their tour\n\n'What gives me a lot of pride for my team is that my clothes fit her. My team was brilliant. I have a master-cutter who is uneducated, grew up dirt poor and unschooled in Lahore. He was very naughty and refused to go to school.\n\n'His parents sent him to me to be apprenticed. I started teaching him out to stitch. He's a grandfather today and he's my head cutter. He's dyslexic to boot but he's absolutely brilliant. It's not always an education that gets you somewhere.'\n\nMaheen said it was a 'dream come true' to make clothes for Kate and to meet her and Prince William at an intimate reception in Islamabad during their tour.\n\nThe designer was amongst a group of 50 people from the music, dance, fashion and art industries, invited to the party, hosted by British High Commissioner at the Pakistan Monument.\n\n'It was all done very methodically,' she said. 'I was at table number three. We were introduced to them by one of the British High Commission officials.\n\n'It was quite simple as I was given a brief but allowed the freedom to create what I thought would be appropriate,' Maheen revealed. Pictured: Kate in Islamabad earlier this month\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visit the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan in central Islamabad\n\n'William kept smiling graciously, saying: \"Nice to meet you,\" while his wife did all the talking. We discussed the clothes, of course, how she loved them and how well they fitted.\n\n'She said to me: \"Thank you for the beautiful clothes.\" I was really chuffed because she moved towards me with a smile and said softly: \"The trousers fit so well.\"\n\n'It was the biggest compliment she could give me because they are the hardest thing to make. It was such a lovely and genuine thing to say. \"Thank you so much\", I replied. \"That's the nicest thing you could say\".\n\nShe continued: 'It was like a dream come true. I've always had such a fascination with the Royal family \u2013 my youngest aunt stood all night in the rain to watch the Coronation.\n\n'I was struck by what a beautiful couple they are. Such grace. It was just wonderful meeting them. They were friendly and normal. They made you feel comfortable.\n\n'I did feel a bit emotional looking at him because of his mother. For me, Diana is an icon for women all over the world. Not just the way she dressed but the person she was and the journey she had - it's the journey of all women.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Duchess of Cambridge's stylist\u00a0Natasha Archer came across Maheen Khan's designs at O'Nitaa, in London's Chelsea Green, before asking her for custom-made pieces.", "authors": ["Claudia Joseph And Laaleen Sukhera", "Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20185692-0-image-a-103_1572016022279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
