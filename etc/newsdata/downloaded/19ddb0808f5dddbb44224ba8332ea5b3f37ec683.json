(Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the bakers were within their rights.) News of the bakery incident sparked outrage and was plastered on the news off and on for years.\n\nBut judging from the recent past, the reported refusal of a Cincinnati business to serve a gay man is unlikely to prompt across-the-board national outrage for one reason: The man is a supporter of President Trump Donald John TrumpTo thwart a possible recession, Trump should work on policies that support workers Trump to speak at GOP House retreat in Baltimore after repeatedly criticizing city Kennedy leading Markey in possible Senate matchup: poll MORE. He says that was the reason given for why he was rejected as a customer.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe gay Trump supporter is named Scott Ford and he discussed the incident with me over the phone. He says he planned an event for 20-30 people. When the owner of the business \u2014 where he says he\u2019d been \u201ca loyal customer for two years\u201d \u2014 asked what the event was, Ford told her it was a \u201cpro-Trump event to highlight the president\u2019s accomplishments.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe threw her hands up in the air and said, \u2018No, as badly as I need the money, I\u2019m not doing this,\u2019\u201d Ford told me. \u201cIt blew up into an argument in a matter of seconds. I said \u2018This is a great president I\u2019m supporting as a Democrat.\u2019 I was disappointed and shocked.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s account raises an interesting point: Are people with certain political beliefs becoming America\u2019s new discriminated class?\n\nThe question cuts both ways. Some Democrats demonize \u201call\u201d Republicans. Some Republicans demonize \u201call\u201d liberals. Some Democrats and Republicans demonize \u201call\u201d Trump supporters. Most of the vitriol occurs on the news and social media. But some of the hateful rhetoric and behavior bleeds over into real life.\n\nIn general, hateful speech and opinions are protected under the Constitution, except to the extent they are deemed to incite violence or otherwise become illegal. But, at the same time, civilized society tends to frown upon it. Just as the Colorado bakers were ruled to be within their constitutional rights, a groundswell of public opinion said they nonetheless were morally wrong.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe charged political attacks that dominate so much of the news and social media landscape have, on occasion, arguably led to violence. But even when they fall short of that, something important seems to be lost in rational discussion when a person or group of people unfairly stereotype(s) others based on political choices.\n\n\u201cAll\u2019s fair,\u201d you may reply. \u201cAnyone who is a (fill-in-the-blank political membership) is obviously endorsing (fill-in-the-blank objectionable practices and beliefs).\u201d\n\nYet, cerebrally, we know that isn\u2019t the case. Each political party in America contains people with a hodgepodge of beliefs. Their given positions on a topic may shift slightly \u2014 or drastically \u2014 from year to year or day to day. I think very few of us have a thick bold line on every given topic that falls neatly into the box of a chosen political party or figure.\n\nAnd this may be hard to swallow for those deeply embedded in a particular political philosophy, but I think most people \u2014 whatever their choices \u2014 simply want what\u2019s best for themselves, their families and their country. They differ on what that means and the best way to get there.\n\nMaybe the category of \u201cpolitical beliefs\u201d isn\u2019t about to join the so-called classes in our society protected from certain forms of discrimination \u2014 race, color, religion, sex, disability, family status or nationality. But we might be a more civilized society, and our conversations more productive, if we began seriously frowning on the habit of judging others based on their allegiance to the Republican Party, Democrats, or Trump.\n\nSharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) is an Emmy Award-winning investigative journalist, author of The New York Times best-sellers \u201cThe Smear\u201d and \u201cStonewalled,\u201d and host of Sinclair\u2019s Sunday TV program, \u201cFull Measure.\u201d", "description": "A Cincinnati venue's refusal of a gay man's business likely won't prompt outrage because the reason was his support of Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_081619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
