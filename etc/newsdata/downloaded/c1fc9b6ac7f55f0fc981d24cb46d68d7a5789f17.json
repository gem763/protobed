Their house decorations were very simple, and I noticed they used solar panels to provide their electricity. They were very friendly, and offered us meat, which is usually reserved for special occasions.\n\nThe children were all incredibly eager to go to school, despite having to walk three hours back and forth every day. Their lives seem to blend in with the beauty of nature, and they strive to live life to the fullest and get the most out of it.\n\nCountries all over the world are all working very hard to uplift the standard of living in underdeveloped areas. I believe if we all can lend a hand and spend some time and effort creating positive change, more people around the world could have a better education and live a better life.\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "A group of 34 students travelled to the underdeveloped region in China to visit local children and families.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/c07ffd48-cece-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7imagehires152149.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
