Did it go well? No. No it did not. Not at all.\n\n\u2018To quote Rocky Balboa, \u201cIt\u2019s not how many times you get knocked down, it\u2019s how many times you get up\u2026 and keep moving forward\u201d,\u2019 he wrote in the trolling caption.\n\nChris, 40, continued: \u2018As you can tell from the lump of coal in the center of the plate, this bagel bite never stood a chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I honestly simply cannot imagine what went wrong here. Pretty simple. Microwave. 2 minutes. Maybe she thought it said 2 hours. But I want to commend her for her effort. This is a big step babe. Proud of you [sic].\u2019\n\nPoor Katherine took it on the chin though and joked: \u2018Looks like my plan to just have you do the cooking is working out very well.\u2019\n\nAh, smart lady.\n\nLife as a married couple seems to be going well for the Chris and Katherine, who tied the knot in June after around a year of dating.\n\nKatherine recently opened up about her dating struggles prior to meeting the former Parks and Recreation actor and it\u2019s safe to say, she\u2019s relieved to have finally found the one.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on [and] wonder why certain things are happening in your life and then later they make sense and you\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why\u201d,\u2019 Katherine said on Today With Hoda & Jenna earlier this month.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a struggle, I think, to wait, to figure out why that was happening. When you\u2019re in the moment, you\u2019re just very focused on getting through it and defeating it. And then when you\u2019re able to actually see and realise why you go through something, it\u2019s the best.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued: \u2018With dating, with anything that you do, it\u2019s, like, you have all these experiences [that] can sometimes be really challenging.\n\n\u2018And then especially with finding someone that you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life with; you find them and you\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s exactly why past things didn\u2019t work out\u201d.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
