Angry farmers rolled out around 1,000 tractors onto the streets, blocking several major roads and bridges.\n\nTractors drove through other cities as well. Around 200 of them rolled past the iconic Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.\n\nThe farmers fear that the new environmental rules would damage their business. The measures, put forward by the government, limit the use of certain weed killers in order to protect field birds, like Eurasian skylarks, lapwings and partridges, as well as some insects.\n\nThe protesters say that small family farms will be hit the most, and demand the government to drop the \u201cfarmer-bashing\u201d agenda. \u201cWe\u2019re not animal killers and polluters,\u201d the organizers said.\n\nAmid the protests, Environment Minister Svenja Schulze promised to help farmers adapt to the new policy and invited them to discuss how to make their businesses \u201cenvironmentally friendly.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com What\u2019s the beef?
