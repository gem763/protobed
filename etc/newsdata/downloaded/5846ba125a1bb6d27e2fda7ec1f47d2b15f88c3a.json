Much of Neumann's stake involves something called \"profits interests,\" or shares in those various LLCs, which obscures his ownership stake even more.\n\nHowever, there are some things we do know, and with that information and some educated estimating, we can deduce that Neumann could lose billions of dollars if the IPO falls so short.\n\nSo, just for the heck of it, let's try to estimate what he stands to lose if Wall Street stays cool on his company.\n\nOver 104 million shares\n\nWeWork says Neumann owns 2.43 million shares of class A stock and roughly 944,000 shares of class C stock, and that he controls 112.5 million shares of class B stock. The company's S-1 filing indicates that of that class B stock, some 11.72 million shares are actually owned by others, even though Neumann controls their voting rights.\n\nSo, from a financial standpoint, Neumann appears to own a total of about 104.16 million shares of WeWork, according to the disclosures as they stand now.\n\nThe S-1 also said that in April, employees were able to sell class A and class B shares at a price of $54 per share. This sale was part of its investment deal with SoftBank. The S-1 also said the price was \"above the fair market value of the shares.\"\n\nSo we can infer that in April, four months after SoftBank's investment deal valued WeWork at $47 billion, its stock was worth not quite but somewhere around $54 a share.\n\nIf we use $54 a share, Neumann's 104.16 million shares are worth about $5.63 billion. This could be high. Forbes estimates Neumann is worth $4.1 billion.\n\nNevertheless, if the company's valuation drops to $18 billion, down 61%, and the value of his stock falls in line with that, then a stake that was worth $5.63 billion would be worth about $2.2 billion, a loss of $3.43 billion.\n\nThat's a lot of ifs, of course. Since we don't know how much of the company Neumann currently owns, or how much the shares are really worth, or what his stake will be after the IPO, we have no way of knowing exactly how much money he could actually lose.\n\nAnother 21.3 million shares at risk\n\nHowever, we do know that Neumann faces potentially more losses than the value of his current stake.\n\nJust before filing the IPO paperwork, the company also gave him an enormous grant of 42.5 million shares and some of those are tied to WeWork achieving soaring valuations.\n\nAs we previously reported, a chunk of this grant will vest simply if Neumann stays with the company, even if the company doesn't go public.\n\nPlus, he's slated to get 7.1 million shares over three years if the company hits a market cap of $50 billion, another 7.1 million shares over three years if it hits $72 billion, and another 7.1 million shares over three years if it hits $90 billion.\n\nThe way it's looking, WeWork would have to produce some Herculean growth in the next three years to achieve those goals and unlock those tranches.\n\nSo in theory, there are another 21.3 million shares in equity grants at risk. We can't even make an educated guess what that would be worth, but it would presumably be many millions.\n\nThen again, Rosanna Landis Weaver, a compensation expert with the nonprofit shareholder-advocacy group As You Sow, previously told us such compensation agreements with CEOs were typically nonbinding.\n\nThe board, which is controlled by Neumann and will remain so after the IPO, can change its mind and the conditions of these stock awards. If WeWork doesn't hit those lofty valuation numbers, it may find another reason to reward its founder.\n\nAnd, even if the company's IPO values WeWork at $18 billion, Neumann's stake will probably still be worth billions. Plus this doesn't account for the $700 million he is said to have already pulled out of the company via selling his shares to investors and borrowing against them.", "description": "Adam Neumann's exact stake in WeWork is unknown, but based on some of the available info, we can estimate how bad the smaller IPO will be for him.", "authors": ["Julie Bort"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d77e60b2e22af063a1a63bc-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
