It would authorize 4,000 special immigrant visas for qualifying Syrians per year.\n\nSimilar special immigrant visa programs already exist for Iraqis and Afghans who assist U.S. troops in those countries.\n\nTrump announced at the beginning of the month he would withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leading to the Turkish offensive against the Kurds that the United Nations says has displaced at least 180,000 people so far.\n\nA ceasefire brokered by Vice President Pence is in place as the Kurds evacuate, though reports of Turkish violations and clashes with the Kurds have persisted.\n\nThe backlash in Congress to Trump\u2019s decision was swift and bipartisan. The House has passed both a resolution opposing Trump\u2019s withdrawal and a bill that would impose sanctions on Turkey.\n\nLawmakers criticized the withdrawal as abandoning the Kurds, who were instrumental in the fight against ISIS, to be slaughtered by the Turks.\n\nWhile the resolution and sanctions bill passed overwhelmingly in the House, efforts to get something to Trump\u2019s desk have stalled in the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid Mark Mellman: Three questions for Republicans Menendez seeks probe into if Pompeo violated Hatch Act MORE (R-Ky.) has warned against rushing to sanction a NATO ally.
