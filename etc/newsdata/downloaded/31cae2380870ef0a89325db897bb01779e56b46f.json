Most of the major currencies traded higher against the greenback today with the euro being one of the few exceptions. The decline began shortly after the US equity market open and accelerated into the London close. Comments from ECB Chief Economist Lane added to the pain \u2013 he said this month\u2019s massive stimulus package \u201cwasn\u2019t that big,\u201d adding \u201cthey won\u2019t reach QE limits for a longer period of time and the ECB has scope for further if needed.\u201d The euro is falling despite this week\u2019s better-than-expected report and today\u2019s increase in Germany\u2019s index. Bund yields are also falling at a slower pace than Treasury yields, which is normally positive for the EUR/USD. Yet the pair is down 4 out of the last 5 trading days because investors are worried that between the US and UK\u2019s troubles, Eurozone policy makers will need to step in with more action and the longer the Germans wait to announce fiscal stimulus, the more likely EUR/USD will hit 1.08.\n\nThe persistent decline in Treasury yields, downward revision to US GDP personal consumption and the sell-off in stocks should be negative for the dollar and yet the is rising because the market still thinks President Trump will be safe from impeachment and they don\u2019t see political uncertainty having a significantly negative impact on the economy. Whether that\u2019s true or not remains to be seen but the latest communication confirms our view that the White House will distract impeachment with trade. Yesterday, President Trump said a deal with China could be closer than expected. Today White House Economic Advisor Kudlow said China moves have been positive and the US will not impose auto tariffs as long as goodwill progresses. We believe the deeper the impeachment inquiry, the more market-friendly comments we\u2019ll hear from Trump. , , and revisions to the University of Michigan index are scheduled for release tomorrow. These reports should not have a significant impact on the dollar.\n\nThe best-performing currency today was the New Zealand dollar. popped last night on the back of comments from RBNZ Governor . While the central bank made it clear that more easing is possible, Orr believes \u201cunconventional policy is unlikely\u201d because the \u201ccumulative impact of easing is working its way through the economy.\u201d Considering how oversold NZD/USD was, traders were looking for a reason to take profits. However it's important to realize that the RBNZ is still dovish and open to further easing so in order for the recovery to be durable, we need to see data take a turn for the better. The on the other hand ended the day well off its highs as the US dollar gained momentum. There\u2019s been very little action in . The pair has been confined in a 1-cent range for nearly 2 weeks as a stronger economy offsets lower .\n\nalso ended the day unchanged against the greenback.
