Mark Dayton against the Republican-controlled Legislature threw the dispute back to the state\u2019s politicians with a message that might be summarized this way: Not our problem. Fix it yourselves.\n\n\u201cI think the court is clear: They expect the politicians to figure this out,\u201d said Mary Jane Morrison, emerita professor of law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law and author of a book on the Minnesota Constitution.\n\nThe stakes are high: Without a resolution, the House and Senate will soon run out of money to pay legislators and their employees, following Dayton\u2019s veto of their budget. In its ruling issued at the end of last week, the Supreme Court declined to strike down Dayton\u2019s veto, but also suggested that it led to an \u201cunconstitutional result.\u201d\n\nInstead of a definitive ruling, the court in the order signed by Chief Justice Lorie Skjerven Gildea directed both parties to hire a mediator by Tuesday and demanded a report on the status of the Legislature\u2019s bank accounts by Friday.\n\nMinnesota Public Radio: Lawmakers grill Public Safety staffers over license problems\n\nMinnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mona Dohman apologized Monday for mistakes her agency made in the summer roll-out of the new computer system for vehicle licensing and registration.\n\nDohman appeared before a legislative panel that wanted answers about the department\u2019s efforts to fix the problem-plagued system. Legislators also pressed for assurances that the processing of drivers\u2019 licenses will go smoother when that phase begins later this year.\n\nComplaints about the Minnesota Licensing and Registration System, or MNLARS, have been piling up since it went online in late July. Many people have experienced frustrating delays in the processing of license plates, tabs and titles.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue work diligently to make sure that this system functions better in the future. We\u2019ve made great progress, but we have more work to be done,\u201d Dohman said during a contentious two-and-a-half-hour hearing held by the House transportation committee.\n\nAssociated Press: Minnesota Commerce Department recommends against Line 3 pipeline plan\n\nEnbridge Energy has failed to establish the need for its proposal to replace its aging Line 3 crude oil pipeline across northern Minnesota and it might be better to just shut down the existing line, the Minnesota Department of Commerce said Monday.\n\nIn filings with the state Public Utilities Commission on Monday, the agency said refineries in Minnesota and the upper Midwest already have sufficient supplies of crude oil and little capacity for processing more of it. It said Minnesota\u2019s demand for gasoline and other refined petroleum products appears unlikely to increase over the long term. And it said the proposal carries serious environmental and socio-economic risks that outweigh the benefits to Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIn light of the serious risks of the existing Line 3 and the limited benefit that the existing Line 3 provides to Minnesota refineries, Minnesota would be better off if Enbridge proposed to cease operations of the existing Line 3, without any new pipeline being built,\u201d said a filing by Kate O\u2019Connell, manager of the department\u2019s Energy Regulation and Planning Unit.\n\nThe proposal by Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge to replace Line 3, which was built in the 1960s to carry Canadian crude to its terminal in Superior, Wisconsin, has generated strong opposition from tribal and environmental groups. That\u2019s because the company\u2019s preferred route cuts through the Mississippi River headwaters region and pristine lake country where Ojibwe bands harvest wild rice, and because the new pipeline could carry tar sands oil, which they consider dirtier to produce than lighter crude. Business and labor groups back the $7.5 billion Enbridge project.", "description": "Minneapolis Star Tribune:\u00a0Dayton and Legislature head for mediation, with solution .09/02/2019 3:04:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
