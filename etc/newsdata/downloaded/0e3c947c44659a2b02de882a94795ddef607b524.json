He turn down a $30 million extension from Denver earlier this year, and team has big plans for him in their future. Meanwhile, Beasley recently made headlines for something off the court but not having to do with his contract.\n\nIn a video released by TMZ this week, Beasley was seen on CCTV fighting with NFL free agent safety Su\u2019a Cravens in the lobby of an apartment building. According to TMZ, Beasley and Cravens got into an altercation over Montana Yao, an Instagram model and the mother of Beasley\u2019s son.\n\nThe incident happened on Aug. 9, and Cravens appeared to be winning until people eventually pulled the two sides apart. Afterward, Cravens could be heard on Snapchat talking about the fight (NSFW).\n\nWe don\u2019t have word yet about the legal situation regarding this fight or whether the NBA will seek any punitive measures against Beasley. This point, this incident happened all the way back in August, so if the Nuggets or the NBA were going to do anything about it, it seems like we would have heard something by now.", "description": "Beasley and Su'a Cravens reportedly got into an altercation over Montana Yao, an Instagram model and the mother of Beasley\u2019s son.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IvXir4z34njoQGu2BlO2sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GqfbHwXDZeD9kMwo5fJCJg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/df619fe844a5b8b63b63ec7e2ce86b92", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
