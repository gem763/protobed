According to an updated Google support page first spotted by Android Police, wireless Android Auto support for newer Samsung phones has been added, broadening the pool of compatibility beyond Pixel and Nexus phones.\n\nThe catch, of course, is that wireless Android Auto is still only available on aftermarket head units, meaning Samsung smartphone owners who want to live a wire-free life will have to pony up a few hundred dollars and get one installed. (A wireless version of Apple\u2019s own smartphone-powered in-car infotainment system, CarPlay, is available standard on a number of new Audi, BMW, and Mini vehicles.)\n\nIf and when Samsung smartphone owners get one of these head units, they\u2019ll just need to make sure they have the phone running Android 9.0, as well as version 4.7 or higher of the Android Auto app, according to the Google support page. After that (and a quick setup process) they can run Android Auto over their vehicle\u2019s Wi-Fi.\n\nOne issue some early wireless CarPlay and Android Auto users have reported is that projecting the smartphone\u2019s operations over Wi-Fi tends to drain a smartphone\u2019s battery rather quickly, meaning drivers may wind up having to plug in on longer drives anyway \u2014 unless, that is, their car also offers wireless charging.", "description": "Owners of Samsung\u2019s S8, S9, and S10 phones \u2014 Note versions included \u2014 will now be able to use Android Auto without plugging anything in.
