She handed him a beginner\u2019s book on how to paint horses, which was soon returned.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t a clue who he was,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cI said, \u2018This is a simple book on how to draw horses, maybe you would like to look at it.\u2019 Lucian carefully turned over each page. Then he handed it back to me in a very gentlemanly fashion, thanked me and said, \u2018It\u2019s very good.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The sketch of Goldie. Photograph: \u00a9 Lucian Freud\n\nFreud became a regular at the centre over time. \u201cWhat he valued was that nobody knew who he was. He\u2019d come in the morning. I had several students with special needs in the yard on courses. They hadn\u2019t a clue who he was. So that was freedom for him,\u201d said Sister Mary Joy.\n\nTo raise funds for the charity, which she founded 30 years ago, she has now decided to part with a picture of a Welsh cob called Goldie, a stunning chestnut with flaxen mane and tale. It is estimated to fetch between \u00a340,000 and \u00a360,000 at auction.\n\nSister Mary Joy was surprised when Freud selected the horse: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to spend hours with Goldie. She liked her own space and would tell you, \u2018I\u2019m not particularly keen on you.\u2019 I really wanted him to go to Sioux, a skewbald mare with a lovely personality.\u201d After a few days, Freud realised that he also \u201cdidn\u2019t warm\u201d to Goldie, she recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s when he chose Sioux. He did two paintings of her.\u201d\n\nFreud died in 2011, aged 88, with his output in later years marked by a number of equine portraits. It is rare for works by him to have not been seen, so any discovery is significant.\n\n\u201cI love the Sketch of Goldie for what it reveals about Lucian\u2019s process \u2013 a canvas worked up in charcoal and then rubbed over with paint rags to give it form and energy,\u201d said Krassi Kuneva, from Chiswick Auctions in west London, which will offer the drawing up in its sale of modern and postwar British art on 3 December.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lucian Freud photographed in 1982. Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the physicality of a painting but the delicacy of a drawing, an unusual combination, especially for him. The very distinctive cropping of the muzzle and front hoofs add an intensity.\u201d\n\nAsked why Freud gave the work to her, Sister Mary Joy said: \u201cLucian told me that, if he didn\u2019t like a painting, he would destroy it. He just left it in my office. I never took it out, never showed it to anybody.\u201d She added: \u201cHe said to me that, all the time he was doing [a painting], it was part of him. But once it was completed, it then meant nothing to him.\u201d\n\nThe pair\u2019s friendship was close: they spoke about his gambling problems, said Sister Mary Joy, as well as religion: \u201cHe was from a Jewish background. He well knew that I was a Roman Catholic religious sister. He believed you are what you are, not what you come from.\u201d\n\nFreud used to bring Sioux carrots and apples, and would ride her without a saddle and riding hat, much to Sister Mary Joy\u2019s alarm. He quietly donated money to the centre, in envelopes marked \u201cFor Sioux\u201d.\n\nSketch of Goldie will be unveiled to the public at the pony centre on 23 November, from 1pm.", "description": "Sister Mary Joy recalls her unlikely friendship with the artist as equine sketch goes to auction", "authors": ["Dalya Alberge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/866f080a8a997d9206715d3913a34417c29dd068/0_551_3165_1899/master/3165.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8690d4a30913135fd37a0d7b37e42583", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
