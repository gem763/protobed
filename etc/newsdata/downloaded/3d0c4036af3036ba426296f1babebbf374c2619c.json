It has opened a new front in the eight-year Syrian civil war and drawn international condemnation.\n\nErdogan dismissed the criticism, saying the assault against Turkey\u2019s Kurdish militia foes \u201cwill not stop ... no matter what anyone says.\u201d\n\nA war monitor gave a death toll of more than 100 from the first days of the assault. The United Nations said 100,000 people had fled their homes.\n\nFending off accusations he had abandoned the Kurds, who are loyal allies of the United States, Trump suggested Washington could mediate in the conflict.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump had authorized the drafting of \u201cvery significant\u201d new sanctions against Turkey, a NATO ally, adding Washington was not activating the curbs now but would do so if necessary. Sanctions have been demanded by Republican congressional critics of Trump\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cWe can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nTrump\u2019s defence secretary, Mark Esper, told a briefing that the United States had not abandoned the Kurds. U.S. officials had urged Turkey to halt the assault, Esper said, warning of \u201cdramatic harm\u201d to bilateral relations.\n\nOn Friday, Turkish warplanes and artillery struck around Syria\u2019s Ras al Ain, one of two border towns that have been the focus of the offensive, now in its third day.\n\nReuters reporters heard gunfire there from across the frontier in the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.\n\nHundreds of kilometres further east along the frontier, a car bomb blew up outside a restaurant in Qamishli as the city came under fierce Turkish shelling. Kurdish authorities said the bomb killed three civilians and wounded nine. Islamic State claimed responsibility, saying it had targeted Kurdish fighters.\n\nA convoy of 20 armoured vehicles carrying Turkish-allied Syrian rebels entered Syria from Ceylanpinar. Some made victory signs, shouting \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d (God is greatest) and waving Syrian rebel flags as they advanced towards Ras al Ain.\n\nSome 120 km (75 miles) to the west, Turkey resumed shelling near Tel Abyad town, a witness said. The Kurdish fighters called it the most intense fighting in three days of battles there.\n\nOvernight, clashes erupted along the entire 400 km stretch of border from Ain Diwar at the Iraqi frontier to Kobane. \u201cThe whole border was on fire,\u201d said Marvan Qamishlo, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nTurkish forces have seized nine villages near Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, said Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war. It reported at least 54 fighters with the SDF, 42 Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and 17 civilians had been killed.\n\nTurkey says two Turkish soldiers have been killed. Turkish authorities said on Friday two people were killed and three wounded by mortar shelling in the border town of Suruc, while eight were killed and 35 wounded in a mortar and rocket attack on Turkey\u2019s border town of Nusaybin.\n\nA Kurdish official who oversees aid work in northeast Syria, Khaled Ibrahim, said water to Hasaka city and nearby areas was cut by Turkish shelling that damaged a pumping station. It had provided safe water for at least 400,000 people, UNICEF said.\n\nREFUGEES \u2018WEAPONISED\u2019\n\nTurkey says its aim is to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an enemy for its links to insurgents in Turkey. It aims to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria, where it can resettle many of the 3.6 million refugees it has been hosting.\n\nMembers of Syrian National Army, known as Free Syrian Army, drive in an armored vehicle in the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 11, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nErdogan said the assault would continue \u201cuntil all the terrorists go further south than the 32 km border (strip) that Mr. Trump mentioned,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Turkish president threatened to send refugees to Europe if the European Union did not back his assault. That prompted a furious response from the EU.\n\n\u201cWe will never accept that refugees are weaponised and used to blackmail us,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk wrote on Twitter. France said sanctions against Turkey would be discussed at an EU summit next week.\n\nResponding to the international criticism, Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu defended Ankara\u2019s record of intervention in Syria, telling the New York Times in an interview that Turkey had provided schools, hospitals and other services in other areas under its control.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG is the main fighting element of the SDF, which has acted as the principal allies of the United States in a campaign that recaptured territory from Islamic State.\n\nThe SDF now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nRARE REPUBLICAN CRITICISM OF TRUMP\n\nThe SDF\u2019s Qamishlo said five Islamic State fighters had escaped from jail in Qamishli after nearby Turkish shelling.\n\nIn the al-Hol camp, home to thousands of women and children who emerged from the last Islamic State strongholds, Qamishlo said an uprising had taken place among foreigners.\n\n\u201cThe Daesh (Islamic State) women rose against the internal security forces at al-Hol, they set ablaze tents and attacked the administrative and security offices there with stones and sticks,\u201d Qamishlo said.\n\nIn the United States, Trump\u2019s decision to withhold protection from the Kurds has been one of the few issues to prompt criticism from his fellow Republicans.\n\nTrump said on Twitter on Thursday: \u201cWe have one of three choices: Send in thousands of troops and win Militarily, hit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds!\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\n\u201cI hope we can mediate,\u201d Trump said later.\n\nWestern countries\u2019 rejection of the offensive creates a rift in NATO. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he expected Turkey to act with restraint. Cavusoglu said Ankara expected \u201cstrong solidarity\u201d from the alliance.", "description": "Turkey intensified its air and artillery strikes in northeast Syria on Friday, escalating an offensive against Kurdish militia that has drawn warnings of humanitarian catastrophe and turned some Republican lawmakers against U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439799936&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1VO", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
