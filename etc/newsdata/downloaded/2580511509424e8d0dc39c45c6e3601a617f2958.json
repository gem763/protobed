Many died of thirst and hunger while adrift for over a week in a lifeboat in the Pacific ocean.\n\nThe report commissioned by the government detailed a litany of failings that caused the tragedy, including the ferry\u2019s departure without notifying authorities. This omission meant it was several days before authorities realised the catamaran was missing and organised a search effort. \u201cWith hardly any food and water, the survivors began to perish,\u201d investigators said in the report, ordered by the office of Kiribati\u2019s president.\n\nMissing Kiribati ferry: seven passengers found in lifeboat Read more\n\nThe MV Butiraoi left the Kiribati island of Nonouti, about 3,000km (1,864 miles) south-west of Hawaii, on its way to Kiribati\u2019s capital, Tarawa, 250km (155 miles) away on 18 January.\n\nThe vessel, loaded with almost 30 tonnes of dried coconut kernels called copra and 35 empty fuel drums, was not licensed to carry passengers in the open ocean.\n\nThe crew had also been drinking alcohol, the investigators found.\n\nFacing strong winds and 2.5-metre (8ft) waves, the boat broke apart and capsized two hours after departure. The catamaran had been poorly maintained, according to the report, and had run aground previously, likely damaging its structure.\n\nTwo life rafts carrying a total of 50 people were launched but one became unusable after a puncture. As passengers reached for the one working lifeboat, its floor \u201cfailed\u201d as well, the commission said. Others clung to the capsized hull of the ferry.\n\nAuthorities did not commission a search-and-rescue operation until 26 January when the catamaran\u2019s arrival in Tarawa became clearly overdue.\n\nThat operation included help from US, Australian and New Zealand aircraft and lasted for six days.", "description": "Vessel was not permitted to carry people on open ocean and soon broke apart in heavy seas, official report says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a60312c9d8acc4b380fd10c274dfd19cafa8076/0_58_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=400043515178ddad02b7b928ea63e6b6", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
