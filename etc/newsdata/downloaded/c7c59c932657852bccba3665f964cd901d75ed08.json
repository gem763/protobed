His wife (right) was suspended in June 2017 and she was sacked in February 2018. She now works as an early years teacher at another school\n\nMr Schalch was branded \u2018immoral and shabby\u2019 by a judge but cleared of criminal wrongdoing because the girl was a pupil at another school.\n\nHis wife was suspended in June 2017 and she was sacked in February 2018. She now works as an early years teacher at another school.\n\nThe disciplinary panel said she had been placed in an 'invidious and compromising position by the actions of her husband' but said she had placed the girl at risk of harm by not reporting it.\n\nMrs Schalch said in a statement: 'My failure to safeguard Pupil A was very wrong. In failing to report the affair I made a very serious error of judgement.'\n\nIf it happened again she said she 'would report it immediately...even if it ended my marriage'.\n\nShe told the panel she felt isolated and lonely she found out about the affair saying it was a 'private secret' which she could not discuss with her father or friends.\n\nShe added: 'At the time of coming home and finding your husband with his mistress, I was not thinking about her and about her welfare.'\n\nWitnesses said Mrs Schalch was a 'true gem in the world of education', an exceptional teacher who was hugely respected and admired by colleagues.\n\nThe panel found her guilty of unacceptable professional conduct but did not ban her from the classroom.\n\nThe panel concluded she had been the victim of 'appalling and invidious circumstances' and said it would be a 'travesty to see a high quality, talented, caring, knowledgable practitioner which as Mrs Schalch lose the ability to teach'.\n\nThe TRA decision maker Alan Meyrick said a banning order was not necessary and that a published decision was proportionate and in the public interest.", "description": "Jane and Bryan Schalch, aged 39 and 42,\u00a0were both teachers at a prestigious independent school in Warwick when Mr Schalch began an affair with the teenager.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19855458-0-image-a-2_1571343292587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
