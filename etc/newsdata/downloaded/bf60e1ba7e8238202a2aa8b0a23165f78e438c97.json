I feel like I want to enjoy my batting and this will give me a bit of a break,\u201d Moeen told ESPNcricinfo. \u201cI want to spend some time with the family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing for England for five years and it\u2019s been quite tough. The intensity is obviously higher in test cricket so this is just to give me a break and then we will see what happens after that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ruling out playing test cricket in the future. I\u2019ve had long chats and thought about it quite a lot. I just want to give myself a bit of time to refresh my batteries and see where it goes after that.\u201d\n\nAli has played 60 tests, 101 one-dayers and 25 Twenty20 internationals - scoring eight hundreds while taking 280 wickets across formats.\n\nHe has, however, retained his white-ball contract and is expected to be a key member for 50-over champion England\u2019s World Twenty20 campaign in Australia next year.\n\nEngland\u2019s director of cricket, Ashley Giles, supported Ali\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cFor all the guys, not just Moeen, it\u2019s been a really challenging summer,\u201d Giles said. \u201cA World Cup and an Ashes back-to-back has had a massive effect on many of these guys psychologically, as much as physically.\n\n\u201cHis experience in the first (Ashes) test wasn\u2019t a great one, but that\u2019s cricket. He\u2019s has been a great servant for his team. And that\u2019s why I encouraged him to leave that option open to come back.\n\n\u201cHe might just need to go away and freshen up. But he\u2019s been a really good servant for this team. And he\u2019s still relatively young.\u201d", "description": "England all-rounder Moeen Ali has taken a break from test cricket after losing out on a central contract for the longest format for the 2019-20 season following a dismal summer.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432258845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K05Y", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
