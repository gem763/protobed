Win the Super Bowl. OK, if you want to win the Super Bowl this is the steps that you've got to go to.'\n\n\"It could very well be a week. Or two weeks. It could be three weeks, it could be four weeks, it could be six weeks. But I have to understand and know if it takes that time I trust in this team that they will\u2014we will\u2014still be in a great situation by the time I get back.\"\n\nThe Panthers have already ruled Newton out for Sunday's game against the Houston Texans. Injuries have been piling up for the three-time Pro Bowler dating back to March 2017, when he had surgery to repair a partially torn rotator cuff.\n\nNewton was deactivated for the final two games last season because of a shoulder injury. His last touchdown pass was in Week 13 last season against the Bucs. He's completed 57.5 percent of his attempts with three interceptions in his last four games.\n\nCarolina will rely on Kyle Allen until Newton returns. The former Texas A&M signal-caller threw for 261 yards and four touchdowns in last week's win over the Arizona Cardinals.", "description": "Carolina Panthers  quarterback  Cam Newton  isn't going to take any more chances with his health, saying Friday he hid the full extent of his foot injury...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/408/hi-res-f0475cfbf37969b4395c51fd7d13e5a4_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
