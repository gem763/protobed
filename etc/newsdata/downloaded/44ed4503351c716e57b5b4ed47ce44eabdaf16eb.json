But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nThe language recalled the famous charge by now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who is black, that his 1991 confirmation process was akin to a \u201chigh-tech lynching,\u201d as he denied allegations at the time of sexual harassment against Anita Hill.\n\nBut Trump was swiftly condemned by Democrats for using such racially charged language on Tuesday.\n\n\"You think this impeachment is a LYNCHING?\" tweeted Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. \"What the hell is wrong with you? Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s beyond shameful to use the word 'lynching' to describe being held accountable for your actions,\" Julian Castro, a Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweet comes amid the escalating impeachment inquiry in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the formal process last month, following revelations surrounding the president\u2019s summer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pressed for politically charged investigations.\n\nHOUSE VOTES TO SET ASIDE RESOLUTION CENSURING SCHIFF\n\nAs detailed in a whistleblower complaint and transcript of the call, Trump pushed the Ukrainian president to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, over their dealings in Ukraine\u2014specifically, why the elder Biden pressured the former Ukrainian president to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating a natural gas firm where Hunter sat on the board.\n\nThe president\u2019s request also came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, something critics have cited as evidence of a quid pro quo arrangement. The White House and the president\u2019s allies have denied a quid pro quo -- though Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney seemed to say otherwise, before walking it back -- and the Bidens have maintained that they did \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans have blasted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff for the way he has handled the inquiry thus far, claiming last week that he and other Democratic committee chairs are withholding critical impeachment-related documents and records from them.\n\nOn Monday night, Republicans introduced a resolution to censure Schiff, who is from California, over his handling of the impeachment inquiry, but the Democratic-led House voted to set aside the measure.\n\nThe vote was 218-185. All Democrats voted to table the censure resolution, with all Republicans voting to take action--a move Trump praised Tuesday morning.\n\nAfter the vote, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy condemned Schiff\u2019s \u201cgrave missteps\u201d and \u201creckless behavior.\u201d\n\nTRUMP UNLOADS OVER SYRIA, IMPEACHMENT, DORAL, SAYS HE 'SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RUN THE COUNTRY'\n\n\u201cEach member of Congress must uphold a high standard of honesty and integrity. When it comes to matters of our national security, that responsibility is even greater,\u201d McCarthy, R-Calif., said. \u201cChairman Schiff has fallen short of his duty. From claiming he had evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign to covering up his committee\u2019s relationship with the whistleblower, he has demonstrated a pattern of lying to the American people on matters of intelligence.\u201d\n\nSchiff, though, tweeted Monday night: \u201cIt will be said of Republicans, when they found they lacked the courage to confront the most dangerous and unethical president in American history, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.\u201d\n\nSchiff has said that he \u201cshould have been more clear\u201d regarding his committee\u2019s prior contact with the whistleblower, which was not initially revealed.\n\nSchiff previously said that \"we have not spoken directly to the whistleblower,\" referring to his intelligence committee -- although his office later narrowed the claim, saying Schiff himself \"does not know the identity of the whistleblower, and has not met with or spoken with the whistleblower or their counsel\" for any reason.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump described the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a \u201clynching\u201d on Tuesday,\u00a0claiming the way it's\u00a0being conducted opens the door for future presidents to be impeached \u201cwithout due process or fairness or any legal rights.\u201d", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
