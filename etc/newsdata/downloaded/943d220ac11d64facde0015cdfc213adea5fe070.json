REUTERS/Olivia Harris/File Photo\n\nSwimming powerhouse Australia\u2019s proud Olympic record was tarnished in London in 2012 when they won a solitary relay title and slumped to their worst medal haul in 20 years.\n\nThey slightly improved in Rio, bringing home three gold medals, and Rice expects them to do significantly better in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at Australia\u2019s success in the Olympics we did really well between 1996-2008,\u201d Rice said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe had a bit of a lull in 2012 and 2016. I reckon we can be pretty much back up there in 2020.\u201d\n\nAt the world championships in July, Australia\u2019s swimmers won five gold medals for a total haul of 19 to boost hopes of a substantial tally in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI think we will do quite well. The U.S. obviously are always so strong, there\u2019s so much depth because of their NCAA system. I think we are getting there.\n\n\u201cAustralia is doing a lot of work to sort of convert, emulate what the U.S. are doing. There\u2019s always great rivalry between the U.S. and Australia. Tokyo 2020 is going to be really interesting.\n\n\u201cI think the U.S. will beat us, of course, but I think there will be a lot of new people who will come on the scene as the next big superstars.\u201d\n\nRice, who won three gold medals - each in world record times - at the Beijing Games in 2008, said mental strength will be a defining factor in Australia\u2019s performance in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI am really interested to see how they perform under that kind of mental pressure because that\u2019s something Australia has put a lot of investment into recently and something that I have been contributing to back home,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMental performance, how do we handle that kind of expectation? All of our athletes are trained at the top level ... We just sort of can\u2019t seem to execute always when it really counts.\u201d\n\nIn Tokyo, the U.S. will be without Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all-time, who retired from swimming after the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nRice, who was in Mumbai to announce the plans to set up her academy in India, sees an opportunity for Australia in the absence of Phelps, who won 23 gold medals from five Olympics.\n\n\u201cU.S. has a huge shoe to fill. They may not win all races Michael used to swim in because someone has to come and fill that position,\u201d Rice, 31, said at a beachside hotel in the city.\n\nWhile Phelps\u2019 absence could make a dent in the medal tally for the United States, who claimed 33, including 16 gold, in Rio, Rice was eagerly waiting for a new swimming icon.\n\n\u201cThat would be an ultimate, like a dream come true. It\u2019s so hard, I don\u2019t think your Michael Phelpses, your Usain Bolts, your Kobe Bryants are limited to a country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat kind of superstar just comes around every now and then and if groomed properly and nurtured, whatever country they represent they\u2019ll just kill it.\u201d\n\nDoping has dominated the headlines in the sport in recent times and simmering anger over world governing body FINA\u2019s handling of doping issues boiled over at the world championships.\n\nChina\u2019s Sun Yang was allowed to compete in Gwangju despite the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealing a FINA doping panel\u2019s decision to clear the 27-year-old of wrongdoing during a random drug test last September.\n\nA couple of rival swimmers either refused to share podium or declined to shake hand with him.\n\nRice said a clean sport was non-negotiable for athletes.\n\n\u201cAnti-doping, clean sport, WADA the entire organisation is so important,\u201d the Australian said.\n\n\u201cI would have hated to have raced against someone that was doping knowing that I trained so hard for four years to be physically the best I can in the most natural way and I am racing against someone who is cheating. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "description": "Australian swimmers may not be able to knock great rivals United States off the perch in Tokyo next year but will definitely better their own hauls from the last two Olympic Games, triple Olympic champion Stephanie Rice has told Reuters.", "authors": ["Sudipto Ganguly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434559571&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q14A", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
