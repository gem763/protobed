The levels range from $8271 a year for a level one package to $50,286 a year for a level four.\n\nYou may be asked to pay fees when you take up a home care package. There is a basic daily fee, ranging from $9.52 a day to $10.63 a day depending on the package level. Remember these are charged daily even though you may only use a service once a fortnight. So $10 a day may not sound like much, but $140 a fortnight for a one-hour clean can be a lot if you're not using all the services to which you're entitled.\n\nThe basic daily fee is added to the government subsidy to enable additional care services to be provided. So for a level four package it is an additional $3879 a year to spend (less any case management and administration fees).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may also be asked to pay an income-tested care fee.\n\nIf this is the case, the government subsidy to the home care provider is reduced by the income-tested care fee up to a capped amount.\n\nWe know from the government survey that not everyone is able to get the package level they are assessed for and may be allocated a lower package as an interim measure.\n\nAt the same time there are plenty of people who would rather pay less under CHSP or hold out for a higher level package than accept a lower level one and pay more.\n\nThis is where the \"use it or lose it\" comes in.\n\nAccording to the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT), which makes the decision on the appropriate levels of government-subsidised support, the way to get a higher level package is to use what is available at a lower level first.\n\nFunds going to waste\n\nACAT professionals are often asked to reassess someone for a higher package only to find that they are either sitting on surplus funds in a lower package or aren\u2019t putting in place services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFunds can accumulate for a number of reasons including during hospital stays and automatic package upgrades.\n\nBut more commonly it is the reluctance of some people to accept necessary additional care and support.\n\nIt is an understandable fear, yet it is one that may need to be overcome if someone wants to stay in their own home \u2013 and is getting the subsidised support to do so \u2013 rather than move into residential care.\n\nIn its latest Inside Aged Care study, insights agency Faster Horses found home care recipients frustrated either with the quantum of support available \u2013 they needed more hours of contact \u2013 or the scope of services provided.\n\nThose looking ahead at the services they might need in five years were most likely to choose help around the house and garden, therapy services including podiatry and physio, followed by outings, personal assistance and social visits.\n\nFaster Horses managing director Veronica Mayne says the data clearly shows that while medical assistance is required, mental wellbeing such as house and garden maintenance and socialising are also important.\n\nShe believes there is a need to balance the contractual and regulatory obligations of providers with a recognition that a need for a specific type of assistance may not always fall within an allocated home visit or fit neatly within a specific service category. Further, individuals need a balance of services ranging from physical and mental to social.\n\nIf you have a home care package, do your best to get the services it provides and the help you need. If you don\u2019t use your package, then sooner or later someone else might.\n\nBina Brown is a director of aged care solutions company Third Age Matters.", "description": "It's unwise to 'hoard' funds from a home care package for a rainy day.
