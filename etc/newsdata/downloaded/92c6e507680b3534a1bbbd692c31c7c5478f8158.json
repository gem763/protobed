The Paralympic star (pictured during his performance last week with Janette Manrara) could be seen screaming in agony in footage taken during rehearsals on Friday\n\nDuring Saturday's show, the footage of Will's injury was not shown, and instead viewers saw a glimpse of the star lying on the ground surrounded by crew members, while Will explained the extent of his injuries.\n\nSpeaking in the VT he said: 'I jumped off a table and as I landed I landed with straightened legs. I thought I broke my leg because I never felt anything like it before.'\n\nHe added: 'To hear the words I absolutely can't dance was just really gutting for me. But I need to recover now and come back even stronger next week.'\n\nPainful: During Saturday's show the injury itself was not shown, and instead viewers saw the aftermath with Will lying on the floor in pain\n\nBad: In a VT shown on Saturday, Will admitted he thought he had broken his leg, as bosses confirmed he had been given a bye through to next week\n\nThe injury has now sparked claims that he could be forced to pull out of the show completely, following in the footsteps of Jamie Laing who was forced to quit the show last month.\n\nA source also told the publication: 'The crew rushed to get him medical help. Everyone has their fingers crossed but it looks very bad for Will.'\n\n'He is just praying for a miracle, and in the meantime wishes all his Strictly pals the very best of luck.

Under the rules of Strictly Come Dancing, Will has been granted a bye to next week.'\n\nStrictly's partner Janette took to Instagram to post a sweet tribute after host Tess Daly announced that he would not be taking part in the show.\n\nShe wrote: 'I love you so much @willbayleytt .... I will truly miss dancing the jive w/ you tonight, but let's hope for the BEST & that you get better ASAP so that we can dance once again next week! #WeGotThisChamp #YourMyLittleFighter #TeamPocketRacket.'\n\nEmbattled: Janette appeared on the show on Saturday to share her support for Will, as his future in the show hangs in the balance\n\nWill's injury comes just a week after he left viewers in tears with an emotional contemporary routine, which came after he spoke candidly about being diagnosed with blood cancer when he was just seven years old.\n\nHis arthrogryposis affects all four of his limbs and causes multiple curved joints from birth. It generally results in stiff joints and muscle weakness.\n\nWill learnt to play table tennis when his grandmother bought him a table following his cancer diagnosis.\n\nHe joined the local club at the age of 12 and went on to represent Kent's able bodied men's team before winning the gold medal at the 2016 Paralympic games.", "description": "The Paralympic star, 31, could be seen screaming in agony after falling to the ground as he rehearsed his performance of the jive.
