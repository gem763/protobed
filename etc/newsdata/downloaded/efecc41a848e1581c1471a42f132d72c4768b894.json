The uncrewed Orion will travel into Distant Retrograde Orbit, breaking the distance record reached by the most remote Apollo spacecraft, and then 30,000 miles farther out (275,000 total miles).

Nasa's Space Launch System, or SLS, is an advanced launch vehicle that will 'provide the foundation for human exploration beyond Earth\u2019s orbit', according to the space agency. Launching with unprecedented thrust power, SLS will carry crews of up to four astronauts in the agency\u2019s Orion spacecraft on missions to explore deep-space destinations. Offering more payload mass, volume capability and energy to speed missions through space than any current launch vehicle, SLS is designed to evolve over several decades to keep up with modern technologies and payloads. Nasa's Space Launch System, or SLS, is an advanced launch vehicle that will 'provide the foundation for human exploration beyond Earth\u2019s orbit', according to the space agency (artist's impression) These include robotic scientific missions to places like the Moon, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter. The rocket's first launch, which will be unmanned, is set for 2019 at Nasa's Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. The initial configuration for what SLS can carry past low-Earth orbit and on to the moon is more than 26 metric tons, with a final configuration of at least 45 metric tons. Nasa intends to send humans to 'deep-space' destinations such as Mars and the moon aboard the SLS, with a date for a mission to the red planet set for the 2030s.\n\nIn the incredible footage from this month\u2019s wet flow test, a torrential stream of water can be seen spewing straight up into the air and washing over the complex before dwindling to a trickle in just a matter of seconds.\n\nThe latest wet flow test, shown in the footage above, was conducted on October 15 at the Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Launch Pad 39B. In less than two minutes from start to finish, the system spews hundreds of thousands of gallons of water into the sky, with the stream climbing to roughly 100 feet into the air like a massive geyser\n\nThe SLS rocket will lift off with 8.4 million pounds of thrust, thanks to its four RS-25 engines and two solid rocket boosters.\n\nNASA will use the deluge system to help protect the rocket and everything accompanying it, including the Orion spacecraft, the Mobile Launcher, and the launch pad itself.\n\nThe fast-moving water will be sent pouring out onto the launch pad to \u2018reduce extreme heat and energy generated by a rocket launch,\u2019 NASA explains.\n\nThe space agency is prepping for the maiden voyage of the $8.9 billion Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which will require roughly 450,000 gallons of water during ignition and liftoff to counteract the extreme heat and acoustics.

Space Launch System, or SLS, is a launch vehicle that Nasa hopes will take its astronauts back to the moon and beyond. The enormous rocket's maiden, unmanned cargo flight is currently set for December 2019. The rocket will have an initial lift configuration, set to launch in the mid-2020's, followed by an upgraded 'evolved lift capability' that can carry heavier payloads. Nasa is yet to set a timeline for SLS's second iteration. Space Launch System Initial Lift Capability - Maiden flight: Mid-2020's - Height: 311 feet (98 metres) - Lift: 70 metric tons - Weight: 2.5 million kilograms (5.5 million lbs) Space Launch System Evolved Lift Capability - Maiden flight: Unknown - Height: 384 feet (117 metres) - Lift: 130 metric tons - Weight: 2.9 million kilograms (6.5 million lbs) Nasa's Space Launch System will have an initial lift configuration (second from right), set to launch in the mid-2020's, followed by an upgraded 'evolved lift capability' (far right) that can carry heavier payloads\n\nEM-1 is slated to take off in late 2019 or early 2020 in an uncrewed mission that will test critical systems ahead of future missions with astronauts on board.\n\n\u2018This is a mission that truly will do what hasn\u2019t been done and learn what isn\u2019t known,\u2019 said Mike Sarafin, EM-1 mission manager at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\n\n\u2018It will blaze a trail that people will follow on the next Orion flight, pushing the edges of the envelope to prepare for that mission.\u2019", "description": "The huge tank is being stress tested at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.", "authors": ["Mark Prigg For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/16/19/8615876-0-image-a-50_1547666396628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-16"}
