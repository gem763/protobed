REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nWith other major central banks easing monetary policy, Germany at risk of recession and inflation expectations sliding, ECB President Mario Draghi has all but promised more support, putting all of the bank\u2019s remaining tools in play.\n\nBut Draghi, who hands over the leadership of the central bank to Christine Lagarde at the end of October, will face resistance from more conservative members of the ECB\u2019s Governing Council.\n\nSome policymakers have voiced concerted, public opposition to more radical stimulus measures, particularly the restarting of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing or QE.\n\nThere is also the risk that Draghi\u2019s dovish talk has raised investors\u2019 expectations so high that it will be difficult to fully deliver, leaving them disappointed. That could see market interest rates and the euro\u2019s exchange rate increase, rather than fall.\n\n\u201cThere is high uncertainty about the extent of the expansionary measures the ECB will implement today; and therefore there is large potential for strong fluctuations in the euro exchange rates,\u201d Commerzbank strategists wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHours before the announcement, the weakness of the economy was evident in data that showed euro zone industrial production falling for the second month in a row in July. Germany\u2019s Ifo institute meanwhile predicted a recession would hit Europe\u2019s largest economy in the third quarter.\n\nThe single currency EUR= has fallen 3.5% against the dollar since the ECB began signaling an easing of its monetary policy in June, while yields on many euro zone government bonds have set new record lows.\n\nWhile the ECB has a wide range of policy instruments at its disposal, each comes with complications, from questionable efficacy to big side effects.\n\nThe euro zone\u2019s biggest troubles \u2014 a global trade war, Brexit and China\u2019s slowdown \u2014 are also outside the central bank\u2019s control, suggesting any stimulus would have a limited impact.\n\nThe ECB is expected to lower some of its growth and inflation projections, highlighting that broader risks to the economy have risen since its last staff forecasts in June.\n\nSources told Reuters that the forecasts would predict growth of not much more than 1 percent both this year and next, with underlying and headline inflation rising only modestly.\n\nThe central bank aims for euro zone inflation of just below 2%, a target it has not hit since 2013.\n\n\u2018REINFORCED\u2019 POLICY GUIDANCE\n\nA cut in the ECB\u2019s minus 0.4% deposit rate \u2014 already a record low \u2014 appears to be the least contentious move and policymakers will debate a 10 or 20 basis point reduction.\n\nAlthough this would lower short term corporate borrowing costs, it would immediately hit bank profits as negative rates essentially amount to a penalty charge on their more than 1 trillion euros worth of excess reserves.\n\nSo the ECB is likely to exempt banks from part of this charge by introducing a multi-tier deposit rate.\n\nWhile this option would give an immediate boost to banks, critics argue it would only be small and would disproportionately benefit lenders in France and Germany.\n\nThe ECB is also expected to push out the timing of any rate hike even further, providing a \u201creinforced\u201d guidance on rates that would tie any move to certain inflation conditions, lowering the emphasis on calendar dates.\n\nThe ECB announces its rate decision at 1145 GMT, followed by Draghi\u2019s news conference at 1230 GMT.\n\nQE CLASH?\n\nThe most contentious part of the package will be whether to restart bond purchases.\n\nAlthough this is the ECB\u2019s most powerful weapon, over half a dozen policymakers, including the central bank chiefs of Germany, France, the Netherlands and Austria have expressed scepticism about the need for it.\n\nThey argue the bloc is experiencing a slowdown, not a recession, and that such a tool should be reserved for real crises, especially since the ECB has already used up much of its firepower in past rounds of stimulus.\n\nIndeed, rates are at record lows and the ECB\u2019s balance sheet is more than a third bigger than the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s, indicating limited room for more action.\n\nBut with the Fed cutting rates last month and sending some dovish signals about future policy, the ECB can hardly avoid keeping pace to stop the euro appreciating and further dampening inflation.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t see much room for the ECB to disappoint on rate cuts, forward guidance and tiering, we think the Governing Council may be less dovish than what is priced in by delivering a less generous asset purchase program,\u201d Nomura said.\n\nDraghi is still likely to have the votes if he wants to go ahead with bond purchases, but opposition from the bloc\u2019s biggest economies could be damaging to the ECB\u2019s authority.\n\nPossible compromises include approving a relatively small bond purchase scheme without changing previously established purchase limits, to avoid stirring up a legally contentious issue.\n\nAnother issue is that with Draghi leaving on Oct. 31, some policymakers appear less keen to make a long-term commitment that would tie the hands of the bank\u2019s next president.\n\n\u201cA compromise solution could be to announce QE but to leave the details until later. This would buy more time for the ECB Governing Council to reach a consensus and allow incoming President Christine Lagarde to \u201cown\u201d the program,\u201d BNP Paribas economist Luigi Speranza said.", "description": "The European Central Bank is set to unveil fresh stimulus measures on Thursday to prop up the ailing euro zone economy, but its exact moves are far from certain and a decision that underwhelms markets risks pushing up borrowing costs.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428838094&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1WB", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
