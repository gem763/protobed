But far too often, those flashes are just that \u2014 fleeting and far too inconsistent for a team looking to make a second-half playoff push.\n\nThe prevailing talking point among the Bills\u2019 hierarchy last week was that Allen was 10-5 in games in which he started and finished. And then, the struggling Philadelphia Eagles came to town and bullied the Bills in a 31-13 victory. Sunday\u2019s embarrassing showing does not fall on Allen\u2019s shoulders alone, of course. If anything, Sean McDermott\u2019s defense \u2014 a unit that boasted earlier in the week to Yahoo Sports that it was far better than people realized \u2014 looked lost and completely outclassed.\n\nBut on a day when the Bills' strength (its defense) needed to be bailed out, Allen and the offense could not do its part.\n\nJosh Allen had trouble hanging onto the ball on Sunday in a loss to the Eagles. (AP)\n\nBy halftime, Buffalo trailed 11-7, a deficit that should not have been insurmountable considering the home-field advantage and the blustery conditions. But it was another Allen turnover that paved the way for Philly\u2019s first score and resulted in a lead the Eagles would not relinquish.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Allen fumbled on a designed run at the Bills\u2019 24, and it would take the Eagles only five plays to score a touchdown en route to outscoring Buffalo 20-6 in the second half.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd soon, Allen\u2019s steady start to the game \u2014 8 for 13 for 74 yards and a touchdown \u2014 was quickly overshadowed by another listless, head-scratching performance by an offense that desperately needs to be better to keep pace with other AFC teams in the playoff hunt, like the Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans.\n\nAllen\u2019s final stat line \u2014 16 for 34 for 169 and two touchdowns \u2014 looked fine on paper. And therein lies the problem. Fine will only get the Bills so far. Worse, Allen completed only three of his final 13 pass attempts.\n\nWhen the defense struggles, as it did on Sunday, Buffalo needs to know that its second-year quarterback can take control of the offense and take over a game. And, so far, Allen has yet to prove that.\n\nThe Bills entered the game expecting to make a statement.\n\nTheir defense was eager to prove it was being overlooked.\n\nAnd Allen was hoping to quiet the growing concerns over his turnovers and his lack of deep-ball completions.\n\nInstead, more questions have arisen about just how good these Bills (now 5-2) are and whether Allen can be Buffalo's next Jim Kelly. The Bills have trailed in six of their past seven games, yet their quarterback still has not instilled confidence that he can combat any deficit. Against the Eagles, Allen (three fumbles) again showed that ball security is still a major issue.\n\n\u201cFor our offense to be super successful, I need to take care of the football,\u201d Allen said in a sitdown interview with Yahoo Sports before the Eagles loss. \u201cComplete the balls when necessary and our guys need to make some plays for us.\u201d\n\nAt the time, he also noted that, despite their record, the Bills had not put \u201ceverything together yet. \u2026When we can take care of the football, when we can run our routes on the outside and make some plays there, and when we get our running game going, when we get all those things going we can be really good.\u201d\n\nAllen\u2019s struggles are not unique.\n\nOf the five quarterbacks taken in the first round last year, it\u2019s the four who were taken in the top 10 \u2014 Baker Mayfield (No. 1), Sam Darnold (No. 3), Allen (No. 7), Josh Rosen (No. 10) \u2014 that have either regressed or shown that they are far from a finished product. Only Lamar Jackson \u2014 the 32nd overall pick \u2014 has progressed in Year 2. And it\u2019s because of Jackson\u2019s impressive play that the Ravens are 5-2 and currently sitting atop the AFC North.\n\nAllen and the Bills still have a chance to be special. They still have enough talent to make the playoffs. And they still have a chance to shock the world down the stretch.\n\nBut as of this moment, the Bills are a team still in need of an identity.\n\nThey\u2019re a team still in need of consistency.\n\nAnd they\u2019re a team that still needs its young quarterback to play like the franchise quarterback he was drafted to be.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Allen\u2019s final stat line \u2014 16 for 34 for 169 and two touchdowns \u2014 looked fine on paper.
