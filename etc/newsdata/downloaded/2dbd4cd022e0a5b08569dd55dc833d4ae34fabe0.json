Facial recognition software for retail stores to catch shoplifters made sense in theory, but people were skeptical it would work. So Velaga and his co-founder Igor Nefedov did what entrepreneurs do best: they pivoted.\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018what if we repurposed this for something stupid, like AI that could detect the faces of investors?\u2019\u201d Velaga remembers.\n\nThis month, the resulting project finally made it onto the Play Store. It\u2019s called AngelFace, an Android app that lets users identify whether someone is a venture capitalist by capturing a quick photo of their face. According to Velaga, \u201cYou just hold your phone up to someone\u2019s face for a second, tap a button and their profile will pop up.\u201d\n\nVelaga and Nefedov scraped photos of investors from Signal, a directory of venture capitalists in different industries, as well as Google Images. They declined to specify how many photos they have, though they said it is over 1,000.\n\nVelaga believes the app can solve a common issue for new entrepreneurs: meeting and talking to the people who can fund their ideas. \u201cPart of it is like if you see somebody walking down the street in Allbirds and a puffy vest, you might be like who is this? VCs are not the most sympathetic crowd and it\u2019s hard to just go up and talk to them. Now you at least know who they are,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen we tried out AngelFace at Vox\u2019s office, the results were not impressive. The app didn\u2019t recognize Casey Newton (not surprising) or Benchmark\u2019s Bill Gurley (quite surprising). But whether it works is almost beside the point: peer-to-peer facial recognition software is still in its early stages and it\u2019s likely to get more prevalent as time goes on. As Velaga said, \u201cAnybody can make this technology \u2014 the tech we use, someone could figure it out watching YouTube videos.\u201d\n\nToday, AngelFace is focused on venture capitalists based in the Bay Area, though Velaga hasn\u2019t ruled out the possibility of expanding to other cities. He\u2019s marketing the app cautiously because, as he says, \u201cit\u2019s a slippery slope, this technology. We\u2019re not even sure if it\u2019s legal.\u201d\n\nIn California, it likely is. Facebook, Google, and Apple already use facial recognition to detect who\u2019s in your photos, Snapchat uses it to match your face with selfie filters.\n\nBut facial recognition in the public sector is more contested. While cities like New York and San Diego continue to employ this technology in their efforts to police cities, San Francisco and Oakland banned it from being used by law enforcement this past year. Illinois has required affirmative user consent under the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which limits the use of facial recognition and biometrics, since 2008.\n\nDespite these regulatory leaps, Americans say they prefer the use of facial recognition by law enforcement than by advertisers or corporations. A recent Pew survey found that while 56 percent trust facial recognition in the hands of police, only 36 percent trust it in the hands of tech companies.\n\nAdam Schwartz, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says he sees both these uses as dangerous. \u201cPeople expect they should be able to walk around without being tracked by other people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t change our face, it\u2019s the ultimate tracking tool.\u201d", "description": "AngelFace allows users to identify venture capitalists in the Bay Area using facial recognition.
