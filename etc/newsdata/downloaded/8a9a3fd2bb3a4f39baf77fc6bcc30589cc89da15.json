Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have proposed wealth taxes that would shrink the fortunes of the richest Americans. Their plans envision an enormous transfer of money from the wealthy to ordinary people, with revenue from the wealth tax used to finance new social programs like tuition-free college, universal child care and \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nThe wealth taxes under discussion would deal a major blow to the balance sheets of American plutocrats like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. If the tax that Warren has called for had been in place since 1982, the net worth of the 15 richest Americans in 2018 would have been half as much, according to two economists who helped develop her plan. The Sanders wealth tax, which was released last week, would have eroded their fortunes even further, to barely one-fifth of their 2018 total.\n\nThe idea of a wealth tax has become an animating issue for the Democratic Party, which sees it as a solution to long-festering concerns about inequality and the rapid concentration of economic power among wealthy Americans. Its emergence is also an antidote to the policies of President Donald Trump, whose $1.5 trillion tax cut largely benefited rich Americans and corporations while leaving future generations with the bill.\n\n\u201cWe are living in the second Gilded Age,\u201d said Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale University, referring to the stark wealth gap produced by the Industrial Revolution. \u201cWhat we have once again is people both on the right and the left being provoked by the perception they are being left behind.\u201d\n\nBut the idea of redistributing wealth by targeting billionaires is stirring fierce debates at the highest ranks of academia and business, with opponents arguing it would cripple economic growth, sap the motivation of entrepreneurs who aspire to be multimillionaires and set off a search for loopholes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to completely disincentivize capital investment, which is going to be very, very bad for economic growth,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in September. \u201cTaxing capital is not a good thing for creating economic growth, and if anything we should be looking at how we create more incentives for economic growth.\u201d\n\nIncome inequality has surged in the United States in the last 50 years, with the top 0.1% now controlling about a fifth of the nation\u2019s wealth. That concentration of wealth has coincided with stagnant wages, rising college costs and the lingering effects of the Great Recession, which erased trillions of dollars in household wealth, ravaging the middle class. New figures from the Census Bureau released last week show that income inequality in the United States reached its highest level last year since the government began tracking it in 1967.\n\nThe dueling policy proposals from Warren and Sanders come as they compete intensely for support among the same universe of liberal voters and activists. Their tax proposals are seen as critical to galvanizing and building support on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too far to the left.\n\nPolls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, supported a 2% tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Warren\u2019s plan.\n\nThe proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions.\n\nStory continues", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Progressive Democrats are advocating the most drastic shift in tax policy in over a century as they look to redistribute wealth and chip away at the economic power of the superrich with new taxes that could fundamentally reshape the U.S. economy.As they compete for the Democratic presidential", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport", "Thomas Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ko1JdVs3YtDnrx1PZt7MBw--~B/aD0yNjcwO3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/adf92709911b0b28851dd9410b5cfc3c"}
