It\u2019s a little different than your usual Twitch subscribing experience, and yes, it is Apple\u2019s fault. The reason it\u2019s taken this long for Twitch to offer subs through its iOS app is because Apple takes a 30 percent cut of any digital subscriptions or media sold through apps on its App Store. So most companies \u2014 like Amazon, which owns Twitch \u2014 just don\u2019t sell media through iOS apps.\n\nTo subscribe on iOS, you have to buy what Twitch is calling \u201ciOS Sub Tokens,\u201d which cost $5.99, or slightly more than the normal $5 for a Tier 1 sub \u2014 and that\u2019s because of the cut Apple takes for app purchases. After you buy the token, you can redeem it for a one-month Tier 1 subscription. Simple, really.\n\nYou can buy up to 12 tokens at one time. It\u2019s not clear whether you can buy Tier 2 or 3 subs with them. Although, if they work like regular money, you should be able to? We have not tested this yet, and Twitch\u2019s blog post on the subject did not raise the issue. They did, however, start the party with a sweetheart deal: if you buy tokens this month you can get two for $8.99.\n\nAnd yes, Android users, we know you already had mobile subs. What an ecosystem. Love to see it.", "description": "It\u2019s like 99 cents more!", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PB_xv_8lerASQ8Qk8v14dv73jfc=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19289313/ACASTRO_190926_1777_TWITCH_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
