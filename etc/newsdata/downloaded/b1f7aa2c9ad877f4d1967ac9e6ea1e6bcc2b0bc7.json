Sondland is a central figure in text messages that Democrats have described as proof that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nPresident Trump (Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images) More\n\nThe Democrats are set to depose several witnesses linked to the president. They have also requested records from the State Department, White House and vice president\u2019s office in addition to subpoenaing documents from one of the president\u2019s personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, and some of his associates.\n\nIn a phone call with Yahoo News, Jay Sekulow, another one of Trump\u2019s attorneys, suggested the decision to block Sondland from testifying could be the beginning of a larger showdown, with other officials not complying with requests for testimony or documents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the White House\u2019s call, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that the irregularities in the investigation have caused everyone, including the White House ... including the president\u2019s counsel ... to take a deep look at this and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nAsked about whether he meant the president\u2019s legal team is considering refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, Sekulow replied: \u201cI can\u2019t be more particular ... it\u2019s not just refusing to cooperate. I would put it more in the context of exercising appropriate constitutional privileges.\u201d\n\nSekulow also discussed Cipollone\u2019s letter to House Democrats and said it would detail alleged \u201cirregularities\u201d in the inquiry. Cipollone and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for the Democrats on the three committees leading the inquiry also did not respond.\n\nCipollone\u2019s letter, which was addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the chairmen of the three committees, argued the inquiry is partisan and a violation of due process. In it, Cipollone said there was \u201cno wrongdoing\u201d in Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, which took place on July 25. Cipollone also argued the inquiry lacked the \u201cappropriate procedures\u201d including \u201cat a minimum\u201d the right for the president and his lawyers to \u201csee all evidence,\u201d \u201ccall witnesses\u201d and \u201ccross examine all witnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\nSekulow\u2019s comments to Yahoo News came shortly after he appeared on his live daily broadcast and suggested officials would not be willing to testify.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re darn right ambassadors aren\u2019t going to be testifying because the charade has been exposed for what it is \u2014 a charade,\u201d Sekulow said on the show.\n\n\u201cThis kind of cooperation\u201d was \u201cbasically coming to an end\u201d due to \u201cthe way that these witnesses are being treated,\u201d Sekulow said.", "description": "In a letter to House Democrats, White House counsel Pat Cipollone calls the impeachment inquiry \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d and indicates the White House won\u2019t cooperate with it.", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gBavgMOwbXwBWJ3dUXBqDA--~B/aD0zMTc0O3c9NTk4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/16e27cc0-ea17-11e9-8dee-4c11ad9d0bf0", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
