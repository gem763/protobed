The way they beat them was comprehensive so they are the favourites, but we have a foot in the door and anything can happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be very physical. The only way we know is fighting fire with fire. We base our game on physicality and they\u2019re a very physical side at the moment.\u2019\n\nThis promise of physicality is seemingly no concern at all to England\u2019s No.8, Vunipola, who has welcomed the challenge presented by the Springboks.\n\n\u2018South Africa are a similar threat to New Zealand and as you saw on Sunday they are very big people, but then again we have a few big blokes on our team,\u2019 said the Saracens forward. \u2018They have already come out and said they want to fight fire with fire and I guess we return it by saying bring it on.\n\nVunipola won his 50th cap in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It is a final, and it\u2019s one of those things you have to front up to and it\u2019s one of their biggest assets, bit it\u2019s something we have been working on. Like Eddie [Jones] has mentioned they have many different threats and one is their forward pack.\n\n\u2018When coaches throw words like brutality at you, you kind of have to back it up. We have been challenged again to bring the same intensity this weekend.\n\n\u2018They have some big players on their team. None more so probably than their second rowers and Duane [Vermeulen], those guys are great players and it is a challenge for us up front to give people like Elliot [Daly] and everyone else around him that time and space with the ball to do what they do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEngland have won their last two matches against South Africa, but have a poor history against them overall, winning just 15 matches to the Springboks\u2019 25 in the head-to-head record.\n\nFour times the sides have met in the Rugby World Cup before and South Africa have won three of them, although England had never beaten the All Blacks in a World Cup before Saturday, so this team have little regard for history.\n\nThe final kicks-off at 9am UK time on Saturday 2 November.\n\nMORE: Nigel Owens misses Rugby World Cup final as Jerome Garces takes charge of England v South Africa\n\nMORE: Rugby World Cup tickets soar to \u00a311,620-a-seat for England\u2019s final", "description": "Billy Vunipola has told South Africa to 'bring it on' after the Springboks promised England a physical encounter in this weekend's Rugby World Cup final.
