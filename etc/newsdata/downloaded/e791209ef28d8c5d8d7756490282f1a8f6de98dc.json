Get in touch: webnews@mirror.co.uk.\n\nTaking to Twitter, social media users slammed the retailer, with many sharing their stories of disappointment.\n\n\"Selected stores? Just been to Sainsbury\u2019s Calcot, Reading and they said they haven\u2019t got any Dyson vacuums,\" a disgruntled customer said.\n\n\"Missed boxing training this morning to get to Sainsbury\u2019s for 8am to get the Dyson that was reported to be \u00a350. Of course they didn't have any in. I don\u2019t no whether I am more disappointed about not getting the hoover or the fact I was excited about getting a hoover,\" another wrote.\n\nSeveral others also claimed they were told it's a \"hoax\" and a \"scam\" by Sainsbury's workers after heading into stores to enquire about the offer.\n\nThe good news is that Sainsbury's has confirmed the deal is legitimate online - however, it has warned that the offer is not nationwide.\n\n\"I can confirm that this is a legitimate offer to clear some remaining stock,\" the supermarket wrote on Twitter after being inundated with requests from shoppers desperate to find out what branches and regions are participating in the sale.\n\nBut all is not lost as those who have got lucky are absolutely thrilled.\n\nOne happy customer tweeted: \"Woo Hoo! Just got home from @sainsburys Wolverhampton and already using my Dyson V6 Animal that I paid only \u00a350!!!!\n\n\"They are like \u00a3199 in Currys! Loving it.. Thanks Sainsbury\u2019s.... that early wake up was worth it!\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWhat Sainsbury's says\n\nMirror Money contacted Sainsbury's for a comment on the sale and can confirm only selected branches are participating.\n\n\"A small number of stores have reduced some Dyson models to clear a very small amount of residual stock,\" a statement said.\n\nThe spokeswoman added that the deal is live on a 'once it's gone, it's gone' basis and that stock is incredibly limited.\n\nThe supermarket is yet to release a list of participating stores, so if you\u2019re planning on heading down to grab yourself a bargain, we advise you call your local Sainsbury\u2019s first to avoid disappointment.", "description": "Sainsbury's has confirmed the deal is legitimate online - however, it has warned that the offer is not nationwide", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12372243.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/A-Sainsburys-supermarket-in-North-Greenwich-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
