Elizabeth Warren has again apologized \u2013 sort of \u2013 for lying about being an American Indian back when it helped advance her academic legal career.\n\nAt a Native American presidential forum in Sioux City, Iowa last week, the Massachusetts Democrat framed her prevarications as a mistake:\n\n\u201cI want to say this, like anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes. I am sorry for harm that I have caused. I have listened, and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations that we\u2019ve had together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a variation on the old \u201cmistakes were made\u201d defense; at least she admitted to being the one who made the \u201cmistakes.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren, who is as white as Ivory Snow, was identified as a \u201cminority faculty member\u201d by the University of Pennsylvania. She herself asked the school to change her status from white to Native American, according to the Federalist\u2019s David Harsanyi. She self-identified as a \u201cminority\u201d in the school\u2019s legal directory, and was listed by Harvard Law School as one of the \u201cwomen of color\u201d that they had hired for diversity.\n\nThis was not just a \u201cmistake\u201d or exaggeration; it was an ongoing lie, as her DNA test last October embarrassingly revealed. She may or may not have a lone Native American ancestor going back several generations, but she apparently has less Indian blood than the average American white person.\n\nBut this is not her worst lie.\n\nOn August 9, Sen. Warren tweeted : \u201c5 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Michael was unarmed yet he was shot 6 times. I stand with activists and organizers who continue the fight for justice for Michael. We must confront systemic racism and police violence head on.\u201d\n\nThis is many times more egregious than the lie that earned her the \u201cPocahontas\u201d sobriquet by President Trump. The false \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d narrative triggered waves of riots, looting, arson and at least one death, 16 injuries, including to six police officers, and millions of dollars in damage.\n\nIt has fueled Black Lives Matter\u2019s hate campaign against police and forged a false picture of America as a uniquely racist country for which socialism is the only cure.\n\nThere are some well-publicized cases of indefensible police violence, like the horrendous shooting of Laquan McDonald in Chicago in 2015, for which an officer has been charged with murder. But these are rare.\n\nNationally, blacks comprise 13 percent of the population, but account for 26 to 28 percent of police gun fatalities. That seems disproportionate. But, \u201cofficers are deployed to where people are most being victimized, and that is primarily in minority neighborhoods,\u201d writes Heather MacDonald. Her book \u201cThe War on Cops,\u201d also notes that the majority of criminals and crime victims are minorities.\n\nIn many cities, the police are the only thing preventing anarchy. When authorities stop having their backs, as in Baltimore, the crime and murder rate skyrocket.\n\nThe Ferguson narrative began on August 9, 2014, when Mr. Brown, a six-foot-four-inch 18-year-old, held up a convenience store and tried to grab Officer Darren Wilson\u2019s gun while the officer sat in his car. Mr. Brown\n\nthen walked away before charging back, forcing Wilson to shoot multiple times in self-defense, investigators found.\n\nInitial witnesses told the media that the unarmed Mr. Brown had held up his arms in surrender. However, more credible witnesses said Brown attacked Wilson twice. And Brown\u2019s DNA was found inside Wilson\u2019s\n\nvehicle.\n\nOn November 24, 2014, St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced that the county grand jury had declined to indict Officer Wilson. On March 4, 2015, Obama\u2019s Justice Department issued its own report , ruling it self-defense.\n\nKnowing all this, longtime law professor Warren went ahead and recklessly repeated the \u201cmurder\u201d accusation. She wasn\u2019t the only Democrat running for president to do so. Minutes before Warren, Kamala Harris tweeted :\n\n\u201cMichael Brown\u2019s murder forever changed Ferguson and America. His tragic death sparked a desperately\n\nneeded conversation and a nationwide movement. We must fight for stronger accountability and racial equity in our justice system.\u201d\n\nTrolling for minority votes does not begin to excuse incendiary rhetoric of the type that has already cost some officers their lives.\n\nOn July 7, 2016, a racially-motivated Army vet ambushed police officers in Dallas, Texas at a Black Lives Matter protest, killing five, injuring nine and also wounding two civilians before being killed by police. He told authorities that he had \"wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.\" Other police have been executed at\n\npoint blank range in their vehicles.\n\nPerhaps Warren and Harris might want to explain themselves to the officers\u2019 spouses and to other police families who worry every day that their father or mother will never return because of some hate-fueled assassin during a traffic stop.\n\nCiting the Justice Department report and 13 witnesses who saw Brown attack Wilson, the Washington Post \u201cFact Checker\u201d Glenn Kessler gave Warren and Harris four \u201cPinocchios,\u201d the worst rating he awards.\n\nI\u2019m not sure there can be enough Pinocchios to do this justice. How about four Clintons?\n\nRobert Knight is a Townhall contributor.", "description": "Sen.
