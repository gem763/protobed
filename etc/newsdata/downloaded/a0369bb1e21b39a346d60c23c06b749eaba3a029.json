Turkey has said that pact was never implemented.\n\n\"The Adana Agreement between Turkey and Syria - still valid - can be the better path to achiev(ing) security,\" Zarif said. \"Iran can help bring together the Syrian Kurds, the Syrian Govt and Turkey so that the Syrian Army together with Turkey can guard the border,\" he said in a tweet which carried part of an interview he conducted with Turkish state broadcaster TRT.\n\nIran's call came on the fourth day of Turkey's offensive against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara regards as a terrorist group with links to the PKK.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its efforts to persuade Ankara to halt the incursion, saying Ankara was causing \"great harm\" to ties and could face sanctions.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday the 1998 accord could only be implemented if there was a political settlement to Syria's eight-year-old war. He also said implementing the Adana pact would require the Syrian government to be in control of northeastern Syria - which it is not.\n\nIran, a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has regularly urged Turkey to respect Syria\u00b4s territorial integrity and avoid military action in northeastern Syria.\n\nDamascus has said it is committed to the Adana accord.
