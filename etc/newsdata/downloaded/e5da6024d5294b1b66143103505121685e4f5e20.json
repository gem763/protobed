Harvey Weinstein dared to show his face in a Big Apple nightclub last night, and got called out for it \u2014 which then turned into an uncomfortable moment for everyone, including the spectators who had nothing to do with his presence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to name the elephant in the room,\u201d Kelly Bachman said at the beginning of her comic set at Downtime NYC. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had to bring our own mace and rape whistles.\u201d Bachman had noticed the alleged rapist/sex offender in the audience before her set and decided to go after him, against the wishes of management and advice from her colleagues:\n\nKeep getting new followers today is it because my tweets are so fire? lol fuck Weinstein and thanks @ambercrollo ILY #mysecondtweet pic.twitter.com/hLjWn5VM8Y \u2014 Kelly Bachman (@bellykachman) October 24, 2019\n\nSo far so good, right? One aspect of a comedian\u2019s job could be considered as an obligation to ridicule the despicable, especially in the very presence of the despicable. Given the venue and Big Harv\u2019s rather prominent profile, it might have appeared weird to the audience to have no mention of it at all. It might have even been viewed as tacit support, although that would have been an unfair conclusion. The audience didn\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s unclear whether they were sympathetic to Weinstein for being attacked or unhappy about the caliber of the material Bachman used.\n\nWhat happened afterward, however, might have arguably been over the line for someone who hasn\u2019t yet been to trial. Another woman, Zoe Stuckless, began screaming expletives (Not Safe for Work) and demanding action from the club. Stuckless got action \u2014 she got ejected:\n\n4. Holy cow, I'm just seeing this video\u2026. Zoe Stuckless (@revoltchild) confronted Harvey Weinstein at the show\u2026what they said is heartbreaking \"Nobody is going to say anything? I'm going to stand four feet from a fucking rapist and nobody is going to say anything.\" pic.twitter.com/v14tnNUCql \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 25, 2019\n\nA person named Zoe Stuckless posted video of themselves confronting Weinstein at the bar. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to say anything?\u201d Stuckless is heard screaming while pointing at Weinstein. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand four feet from a f\u2014\u2014 rapist and nobody is going to say anything?\u201d Stuckless, who identifies as nonbinary, wrote that Weinstein was sitting in a booth surrounded by young women. \u201cIn some ways tonight was a horrible, painful reminder of the power a man like Weinstein holds even now,\u201d Stuckless wrote. \u201cIt was a reminder that even in this time of relative awareness it is hypnotically easy to be pulled into a culture of silence.\u201d The 21-year-old actor told NBC News they didn\u2019t recognize Weinstein at first and were in complete disbelief because they didn\u2019t think he would ever show his face at an event like that. Stuckless said they thought of their own experience with rape and all of the women who spoke out against Weinstein. \u201cIf no one says anything, then I owe it to myself, I owe it to the survivors and to all the women that Harvey has victimized to say something,\u201d Stuckless explained.\n\nNBC\u2019s Today show covered the incident, with some seeming sympathy for Weinstein:\n\nIt\u2019s tough to have much sympathy for Weinstein, if any, who has a record of public intimidation himself. John Podhoretz wrote about it two years ago, as Instapundit\u2019s Ed Driscoll reminded readers this morning, in a column titled \u201cNasty, Brutish, and Fat\u201d:\n\n\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s good that I\u2019m the f***ing sheriff of this f***ing lawless piece-of-s**t town.\u201d Weinstein said that to Andrew Goldman, then a reporter for the New York Observer, when he took him out of a party in a headlock last November after there was a tussle for Goldman\u2019s tape recorder and someone got knocked in the head. Goldman\u2019s then-girlfriend, Rebecca Traister, asked Weinstein about a controversial movie he had produced. Traister provided the predicate for this anecdote in a recent piece: \u201cWeinstein didn\u2019t like my question about O, there was an altercation\u2026[and] he called me a c\u2014.\u201d Auletta also related how Weinstein physically threatened the studio executive Stacey Snider. She went to Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him the story. Katzenberg, \u201cone of his closest friends in the business,\u201d told Weinstein he had to apologize. He did, kind of. Afterward, Katzenberg told Auletta, \u201cI love Harvey.\u201d These anecdotes are 15 years old. And there were anecdotes published about Weinstein\u2019s behavior dating back another 15 years. What they revealed then is no different from what they reveal now: Weinstein is an out-and-out psychopath.\n\nSo yeah, no one will lament that Weinstein\u2018s evening out was ruined, sauce being as good for the gander and all. This does raise a couple of other questions, one of which is already tainted for being fronted by Weinstein\u2019s reps, but it\u2019s still worth asking. Should we publicly shame and attempt to drive out of the public square those who have only been accused of crimes, even horrible crimes? The concept of innocent until proven guilty strictly applies only to courts and juries \u2014 the rest of us have free rein to form our own opinions with as much or as little information as we like. But is it right to act on those opinions in the manner Stuckless did? Refraining from joining the public spectacle isn\u2019t about a conspiracy of silence; it\u2019s a recognition that we have institutions designed to deal with these issues, and that a nightclub floor isn\u2019t one of them, and neither is mob action wherever the accused step out into public, no matter who they are.\n\nThe second question is whether any potential injury was limited to Weinstein. Tossing an insult or two at him, either from the stage or in passing his table, doesn\u2019t seem out of bounds, but hijacking everyone else\u2019s evening for a shrieking demonstration does seem excessive. At some point in Stuckless\u2019 demonstration, it stopped being about Weinstein and became more about Stuckless\u2019 need for attention. Stuckless offers up a self-referential rationalization for her actions that does nothing to subtract from the impression that she was indulging herself rather than doing anything to rationally advance a virtuous position \u2026 and we have more than enough people indulging themselves in self-promoting displays these days.\n\nBachman took the right approach, even if her material didn\u2019t exactly soar to the occasion. If Weinstein\u2019s arrogant enough to go to a stand-up comedy club these days, he deserves what he gets from the stage \u2014 but the rest of the audience isn\u2019t responsible for Weinstein\u2019s presence and deserve to be left in peace.", "description": "Just desserts or hot-dogging?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/weinstein-today.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
