Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has some new reporting on the relationship between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr. In his July phone call with Ukrainian president Vlodomyr Zelensky, Trump lumped Barr and Giuliani together as lawyers who would carry out his wildly improper orders to gin up investigations of Trump\u2019s enemies, \u201crefer[ring] to the two men almost interchangeably,\u201d the Journal reports. The premise manages to be unflattering to both men.\n\nBarr is upset because Trump sees him as his Roy Cohn, rather than as the dignified attorney general he has attempted to posture as in public. The attorney general \u201cwas surprised and angry to discover weeks later that the president had lumped him together with Mr. Giuliani on the phone call with Mr. Zelensky.\u201d\n\nRudy, of course, publicly hoped to be given a Cabinet position in the administration. Instead he\u2019s in a place where actual Cabinet members complain that that they\u2019re being implicitly compared with him.\n\nDeeper in the article, we encounter numerous other examples of Giuliani\u2019s surrendering the remainder of his tattered dignity in the service of Trump. Trump\u2019s method of leadership typically involves demanding absolute fealty of his aides and then mocking them for the sycophancy. He has used this style to humiliate such figures as Michael Cohen and Chris Christie, and he surely has derived particular joy from transforming a former national hero, who was once so admired for his alpha-male persona that he could write book titled Leadership, into his lickspittle.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood comments boasting of sexual assault, Giuliani volunteered to defend him when other allies were too ashamed to do so. Giuliani \u201ctaped all five [Sunday] shows \u2014 after which Mr. Trump attacked him for his performance. \u2018Man, Rudy, you sucked. You were weak. Low energy.\u2019\u201d (It\u2019s sort of hard to generate a high-energy performance when your client has been caught on tape admitting criminal behavior.)\n\nTrump has also \u201coften needled the former mayor for falling asleep on long flights, and joked about whether Mr. Giuliani was looking at cartoons on his iPad, a former aide\u201d tells the Journal. There\u2019s obviously nothing wrong with using long plane flights to sleep, but Trump \u2014 who does not sleep on plane flights and likes to prevent his traveling companions from doing so as well \u2014 would unsurprisingly see this as a habit worth mocking. Giuliani\u2019s alleged cartoon-watching would seem to be the one form of media consumption that the cable-news-addicted president could condescend to.\n\nTrump mocked Giuliani in front of others at Steve Mnuchin\u2019s wedding, announcing that Rudy \u201cwas spitting while he was talking and order[ing] him to stand elsewhere.\u201d\n\nFor all the humiliation and abuse he receives, Giuliani \u201crarely complained about such treatment, jockeying with other aides and advisers to sit next to Mr. Trump at dinner or on the plane. \u2018Rudy never wanted to be left out,\u2019 one former aide said. \u2018If you were ever between Rudy and the president, look out. You were going to get trampled.\u2019\u201d\n\nNobody is going to escape this administration with their dignity intact. It\u2019s gratifying that even though he was denied a position in its Cabinet, Giuliani will be one of its most prominent victims anyway. As Irin Carmon has theorized, all of us have at least some small part inside that likes Trump, because he sometimes turns his horrible bullying on the other horrible people who are attracted to him.\n\nMy theory of Trump's relative appeal is no matter who you are, eventually he gets around to bullying someone you secretly think deserves it. \u2014 Irin Carmon (@irin) September 14, 2017", "description": "The Wall Street Journal has some new reporting on the relationship between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr.
