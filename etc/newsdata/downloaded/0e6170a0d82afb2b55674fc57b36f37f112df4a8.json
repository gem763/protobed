For example, if a member saves \u00a320 in their first month they will get 20 chances at winning.\n\nIf they save an additional \u00a330 in their second month they will then have 50 chances of winning.\n\nThe Economic Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said: 'We all know that saving for the future is important and I want to make it is as easy and attractive for people as possible.\n\n'That's why we've teamed up with credit unions, on International Credit Union Day, to launch the new PrizeSaver account pilot, giving people the chance to win up to \u00a35,000 on their hard-earned savings.\n\nCredit unions involved The 15 credit unions participating in the scheme are: 1st Alliance (Ayrshire) Bradford District Central Liverpool Clockwise East Sussex Lewisham Plus London Capital Merthyr Tydfil Borough Nottingham Riverside South Manchester Westcountry Savings and Loans Commsave Plane Saver Police Credit Union\n\n'Credit unions provide an invaluable service for people up and down the country and I'm pleased that together we can give more people the chance to win while they save.'\n\nFintech company incuto was appointed by the Treasury earlier this year to administer the pilot and work with credit unions to ensure they can operate the account as part of the government's drive to use UK fintech companies to boost financial inclusion.\n\nThe pilot, which was first revealed by This is Money after scouring through the 2018 Budget document, is designed to encourage new and existing credit union members to save, starting with as little as \u00a31 a month.\n\nIt also aims to attract new members to credit unions, who play an important role in financial inclusion, in particular as an alternative to high-cost lenders.\n\nThe account is partly inspired by the 'Save to Win' scheme in the US, which has helped credit union members save $200million and has awarded $3.1million in prizes nationwide.\n\nThe pilot will run until the end of March 2021 and will help inform understanding of the PrizeSaver model.\n\nAfter which, the Treasury will work with participating credit unions to evaluate the success of the PrizeSaver accounts throughout the pilot, with an ambition to roll the account out more widely if successful.\n\nCredit unions are a type of member-owned cooperative, controlled and run by members\n\nWhat is a credit union?\n\nCredit unions are a type of member-owned cooperative, controlled and run by members and regulated by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nMost either serve specific local areas or certain professions like the police.\n\nThose who save or borrow through a credit union must have a common bond which means they might live in the same area, work for the same employer or have the same profession.\n\nThey can also be members of the same church or trade union.\n\nThey are run on a 'not for profit' basis which means instead of paying a profit to shareholders, they use money they make to reward their members and improve their services.\n\nCredit unions redistribute their profits to members through interest or dividends, or by investing in new services to meet the needs of their members.\n\nUnions can be large or small - some have thousands of members while others are much smaller.\n\nAll credit unions offer savings and loan accounts while some (usually larger credit unions) may also offer additional products and services.\n\nIn England, Scotland and Wales, credit unions serve 1.3million people with savings of more than \u00a31.3 billion, Bank of England data shows.", "description": "The new PrizeSaver account has been launched by the Treasury who has teamed up with 15 credit unions across Britain - we reveal which ones and how it works.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
