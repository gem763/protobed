Everyone's been talking about it at the local school.\n\n'It's surprised a lot of people around here that she has struck up this friendship with a married man who has a family.\n\n'You've got to feel sorry for the man's wife who probably has no idea that they have been spending time with her.\n\n'I don't know what Amy must see in him. He's not famous and in his late forties or fifties.\n\n'I've got my mojo back': Amy previously revealed she's lost two stone and dropped from a UK size 14 to a 10 in just seven months (pictured L earlier this month, R in April)\n\nA source close to the star said the man's wife probably has no idea about the friendship\n\n'He's probably flattered by the attention from someone like her. I think he's had his head turned by the attention. More fool him, really.\n\n'People think it's just a game for her. She'll probably get bored in the end, or his wife will find out.'\n\nIt is unclear when the pair struck up their friendship but pals believe they were chatting on Instagram where Amy has amassed over 600,000 followers.\n\nHer page boasts dozens of racy snaps showing her posing seductively in underwear and bikinis.\n\nA spokeswoman for the star said Child was friends with the married man in question, adding: 'They are just friends. She doesn't know much about him and is certainly not going out with him.'", "description": "The former Towie star and Celeb Mum of the Year, 29, is said to have met up with the unnamed man without the knowledge of his wife after meeting him through social media and becoming close to him.", "authors": ["Katie Hodge For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/14/19297904-0-image-a-25_1570195119202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
