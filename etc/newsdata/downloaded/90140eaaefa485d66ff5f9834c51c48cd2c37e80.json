The attack landed as Taylor remains a part of Trump's State Department.\n\nLast week, Taylor and another witness in the impeachment probe, former Pompeo aide Michael McKinley, retained Bellinger, who served in the Bush administration, according to NBC News. Bellinger was an outspoken Trump critic in the lead-up to the 2016 election, and told Foreign Policy last year he had no regrets about authoring a 2016 letter in opposition to Trump.\n\nAmbassador William Taylor offered impeachment investigators damaging details of the president's foreign dealings. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nTrump also continued to rail against Democrats\u2019 closed-door deposition process for the initial stages of their investigation, tweeting that \u201cDo Nothing Democrats allow Republicans Zero Representation, Zero due process, and Zero Transparency\u201d and decrying the proceedings as unfair.\n\n\u201cEven though there was no quid pro quo,\u201d he claimed, \u201cI\u2019m sure they would like to try. Worse than the Dems!\u201d\n\nHe then appeared to fire off a warning shot at other administration officials looking to lawyer up with \u201cnever Trumpers.\"\n\n\u201cIt would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration, all well-meaning and good (I hope!), could stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cNothing good will ever come from them!\u201d\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the president claimed that though anti-Trump Republicans are supposedly \u201con respirators with not many left,\u201d in his view, they posed a greater threat to the country than his Democratic opponents did.\n\n\u201cWatch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d he added.\n\nThe intraparty fire from the president underscored several rough weeks for the GOP, which saw blowback from Republican lawmakers over Trump's foreign policy moves in Syria, his comparison on Tuesday of the impeachment probe to a \"lynching,\" and the damaging testimony from Taylor.\n\nTrump's new line of attack on key figures in the impeachment investigation also came as dozens of House Republicans, railing against the entirely closed-door proceedings thus far, banded together Wednesday morning to storm the secure room where depositions of impeachment witnesses were being held. Their protest brought Wednesday\u2019s proceedings to a standstill for hours.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly lodged complaints about how their counterparts have handled the impeachment process, taking issue with the lack of a formal House vote on the matter, though such a step is not required, and Democrats\u2019 decision to first question witnesses in privacy before holding public hearings in order to prevent witnesses from aligning their testimony.\n\nRepublicans have also cried foul about an inability to summon their own witnesses for the inquiry or for White House lawyers to sit in on depositions, calling the treatment a violation of due process.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/57/f1/158ff0cd44c69372336952684821/191023-trump-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
