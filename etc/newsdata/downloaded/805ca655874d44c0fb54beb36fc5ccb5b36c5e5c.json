He also said he may sue Democrats in Congress for allegedly violating attorney-client privilege and over obstruction-of-justice claims. The chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed Giuliani on Monday, seeking key documents related to the Ukraine controversy as part of their Trump impeachment inquiry. Giuliani lawyered up Tuesday, hiring former Watergate prosecutor John Sale. Though still mounting a defense, Giuliani claimed he has evidence, in the form of video recordings and interview notes, which are protected from an additional subpoena under the statute of attorney-client privilege. He said the evidence incriminates House Democrats for allegedly trying to threaten foreign powers into keeping quiet amid the impeachment inquiry. He pointed to the example of Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who last month boasted to reporters, including conservative columnist John Solomon, that he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that cooperating with Trump and Giuliani would be viewed as election meddling and would be \u201cdisastrous for long-term U.S.-Ukraine relations,\u201d The Hill reported. Ingraham mentioned members of Congress are given immunity from prosecution in regard to comments made during legislative sessions. Giuliani said he would come after House Democrats for their remarks made outside of Congress, include Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who recently tweeted that Trump should be kept in solitary confinement, and another unnamed congressmen who allegedly said Barr should be arrested. (Fox News)\n\n\u201cI think we have to raise their consideration of constitutional and criminal rights,\" he told Ingraham. \"This is worse than McCarthy. How about a total illicit impeachment proceeding? This is an illicit, rogue impeachment proceeding.\"\n\nAfter the show, The Atlantic\u2019s White House correspondent, Elaina Plott, tweeted out a conversation she had with Giuliani via text, confirming that he was considering a lawsuit that would be \"Trump v The Swamp.\"", "description": ".10/02/2019 11:27:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/266/1dd91349-16db-46a0-9816-21575184c25e.jpg"}
