They\u2019d better talk, otherwise the crazed anti-communist Nixon might shake off the reins of his advisers and nuke somebody.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the inherent appeal of this theory to Trump, who has cited it in congratulating himself for avoiding war with North Korea. But the president, despite the occasional over-the-top threat, is not a natural madman in this Nixonian sense. He\u2019s not a mad bomber; he\u2019s the mad negotiator.\n\nDoes a South Korean delegation have an offer from Kim to negotiate directly, with little or no preparation and fuzzy goals? By all means, let\u2019s accept it, and make the meeting a captivating show. Is U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad nearing a deal with the Taliban? Let\u2019s get leaders of the insurgency, not just to Washington, but to the storied retreat of U.S. presidents, Camp David. Will Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani both be at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly meeting? Let\u2019s talk.\n\nTrump has taken the old Obama statement from a 2008 primary debate that he\u2019d be willing to meet without precondition with the leaders of rogue states, and made it an animating principle of his foreign policy.\n\nThis is why the Russia conspiracy theorists have always been off the mark. They\u2019ve long believed\u2014and still can\u2019t shake the sense\u2014that Vladimir Putin \u201cmust have something\u201d on Trump to account for the president\u2019s unwillingness to offend the Russian leader and eagerness to come to some sort of unspecified arrangement. By this reasoning, the Taliban, Kim Jong Un, Chinese President Xi and Rouhani all must have something on Trump, too.\n\nTrump sees the best in even the world\u2019s most dismal actors because he sees them, no matter how hostile or blood-stained, as potential negotiating partners. Indeed, the more hostile and blood-stained they are, the more alluring they seem\u2014because any deal would be ever more epic, more dramatic, and more validating of Trump\u2019s image as the ultimate dealmaker.\n\nTrump is often interpreted in Jacksonian terms, and rightly so. And yet, he goes well beyond a traditional Jacksonian\u2019s instinct to leave the world alone until, when a threat emerges, he feels compelled to pound it into sand. This has occasionally been Trump\u2019s rhetoric on North Korea and Iran, and his action regarding ISIS. But he\u2019s a Jacksonian as real-estate developer; he doesn\u2019t want to leave the world alone \u2014 or pound it into sand\u2014so much as have attention-getting ribbon cutting ceremonies after audacious deals that prove the doubters wrong.\n\nThe M.O. of a publicity-conscious real-estate guy is, once you\u2019ve cut the deal, even if it isn\u2019t really the best one ever, you insist it is. Your building is almost entirely sold out, rich and famous people are buying there, the prices are above market rates, etc. This is what is known as puffery, and Kim has been the beneficiary of it.\n\nEven though Kim\u2019s missile program continues apace and the prospect of him denuclearizing is as distant as ever, Trump still insists they are great friends and he is a promising young man.\n\nThere are, to be sure, things to be said for Trump\u2019s dealmaking-first approach. When it comes to China, for example, there is at least a colorable case for making a trade deal the priority over anything else right now.\n\nThanks to his flair for the dramatic and his belief in walking away from the table as a tactic, Trump has been willing to blow up his most dubious diplomatic gambits\u2014namely, the deal that was in the offing during the Kim summit in Vietnam and the proposed Taliban visit to Camp David.\n\nFrom one point of view, Trump is an exaggerated version of the mistake many U.S. presidents tend to make. Because getting elected president means by definition that they have better-than-average persuasive skills, presidents often have an outsized view of their own ability to personally sway other leaders.\n\nObviously, though Trump takes it to another level. The problem with his worldview is that, counter to its supposed hard-bitten realism, it depends on the idea that ultimately, yes, we can all get along, assuming the right dealmaker is in the Oval Office. But foreign actors, especially the worst, have interests and ideological commitments that they can\u2019t simply be talked out of and aren\u2019t susceptible to clever workarounds. Not everything is a negotiation.\n\nThe very fact of a presidential meeting is a propaganda victory for the likes of Kim or the Taliban. And perception can\u2019t substitute for reality the way it might in New York real estate. If a New York newspaper is persuaded by happy talk to run a favorable item about a property, it might significantly affect the property\u2019s prospects. By contrast, we can say warm things about Kim, and it doesn\u2019t change what he\u2019s doing or alter any of his fixed goals.\n\nNo tool of foreign policy, including diplomacy, should be deployed indiscriminately and thoughtlessly. Trump views himself as primarily a dealmaker, which doesn\u2019t mean that every deal is worth having or even pursuing. There\u2019s lot of space between \u201cfire and fury\u201d and hosting terrorists at Camp David.\n\nSome hands aren\u2019t worth shaking, some ribbons not worth cutting.\n\nRich Lowry is editor of National Review.", "description": "Some hands aren\u2019t worth shaking, some ribbons not worth cutting.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "John F.
