Kendra and Torsten are married! If there\u2019s any The Handmaid\u2019s Tale fans out there, you\u2019ll know most of it is filmed in Cambridge!\n\n\u201cSo, as fans of the show, it only seemed fitting for there to be some Handmaid\u2019s in K&T\u2019s wedding photos along the \u2018hanging wall\u2019 in Mill Race Park!\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Human subjugation is not a 'theme' for a wedding,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAnother added: \u201cThis is in such bad taste, is so f***ing incredibly tone-deaf, and ain\u2019t how you honour this literary work [sic].\u201d\n\nA third person agreed, writing: \u201cWow, this is deeply disturbing. 'Praise be'? Seriously? I love the show, but this photo is truly puke-worthy.\"\n\nFollowing the backlash, Van Daele and Russell came out to defend the image, insisting that the whole point was to start a difficult conversation.\n\n\u201cTo all who are upset by this image: We actually totally agree! Mission: accomplished!\u201d the photographers wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cEveryone is talking about this issue now, rather than binging on a television series and then not doing anything about what they\u2019re so worked up over until the next season comes out in the spring.\u201d\n\nThe duo pointed out that the \u201chatred, division, fear and breakdown of humanity\u201d featured in the television was being reflected in the critical comments towards the photograph.\n\n\u201cTake a step back and consider you may not actually know the facts, either \u2013 that this image was created and put out by a pair of \u2018Gender Traitors\u2019 who are no strangers to many of the subplots of oppression, violence, and inequality that run through Margaret\u2019s brilliant work.\u201d\n\nThe photographers called on people criticising their work to put their anger into action by participating in women\u2019s marches and supporting equal rights instead of \u201cscrolling through Instagram, knee-jerking your way through comments\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhy exactly are you offended? Have you asked yourself? And what are you actively doing about it in the real world?,\u201d the pair concluded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that this is starting a conversation!\u201d\n\nVan Daele and Russell have since removed the photograph from their social media at the request of the couple.\n\nLast year, a lingerie and costume retailer faced criticism for selling a sexualised outfit inspired by the same show for Halloween.\n\nThe \u201cBrave Red Maiden\u201d costume sold by Yandy made reference to the outfits female characters are made to wear in the dystopian TV drama.\n\nThe brand responded to the backlash with a formal apology and removed the costume from its site.\n\n\u201cOver the last few hours, it has become obvious that our \u2018Yandy Brave Red Maiden Costume\u2019 is being seen as a symbol of women\u2019s oppression, rather than an expression of women\u2019s empowerment,\" a statement said.\n\n\u201cThis is unfortunate, as it was not our intention on any level. Our initial inspiration to create the piece was through witnessing its use in recent months as a powerful protest image.\n\n\u201cGiven the sincere, heartfelt response, supported by numerous personal stories we\u2019ve received, we are removing the costume from our site.\"", "description": "A newlywed couple have been criticised online after posing for wedding photographs in front of a replica of the \u2018hanging wall\u2019 from hit\u00a0television show The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u00a0 The controversial image features Kendra Munro and Torsten Mueller kissing in front of the wall in Cambridge, Canada, alongside photoshopped images of women wearing the iconic red robes and white bonnets", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/14/14/handmaid.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
