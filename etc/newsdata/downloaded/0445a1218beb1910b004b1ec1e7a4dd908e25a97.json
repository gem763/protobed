Andrew Goedl via AP)\n\nBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The U.S-led coalition and Turkey conducted their third joint patrol in northeastern Syria on Friday, part of a plan designed to defuse tensions between Washington\u2019s two allies _ Turkey and the Syrian Kurds.\n\nThe patrol followed a telephone call late Thursday between Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper during which Akar reiterated that Turkey wont\u2019 accept a delay in the creation of what it calls \u201ca safe zone\u201d and would act alone if necessary to set it up.\n\nAkar also told Esper that Turkey would end the joint patrols \u201cif there are distractions, delays\u201d and urged the U.S. to end its support to Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nAnkara views Syrian Kurdish fighters as an extension of a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey and wants them away from the Turkey-Syria border. It has repeatedly threatened to carry out a military operation to push the Kurds away.\n\nTurkey had carried out military incursions with allied Syrian groups in western Syria to drive out Kurdish fighters, as well as Islamic State militants, and has stationed troops there.\n\nBut a Turkish military operation in northeastern Syria would carry a larger risk, bringing Turkish soldiers into a zone where at least 1,000 US troops are deployed.\n\nAkar told his U.S. counterpart Turkey \u201cwould not allow the establishment of a terror corridor to its south,\u201d according to his statement.\n\nThe coalition said the patrol went ahead as planned and Turkey\u2019s defense ministry said it was in an area east of the town of Tal Abyad.\n\nWashington says the deal reached with Ankara in August aims to address Turkey\u2019s security concerns.\n\nSo far, fighters from the most prominent Syrian Kurdish group _ the People\u2019s Protection Units or YPG _ have moved away from border posts.\n\nBut Turkey remains unhappy with the size of the area it calls a \u201csafe zone.\u201d It also wants some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees to return there.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament that Turkey plans to settle 2 million refugees in the zone, and will hold a donors' conference to help build homes and infrastructure for them.\n\nIt is not clear how Turkey plans to move the largely Sunni Arab Syrians it is hosting from many parts of Syria into the Kurdish-dominated region, and whether the US is on board.", "description": "The U.S-led coalition says it\u2019s conducted the third joint patrol with Turkey in northeastern Syria, part of a plan designed to defuse tensions between its NATO ally and Syrian Kurds.
