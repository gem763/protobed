While sweet pastry pumpkin pies are less ubiquitous in the UK than across the pond, Whole Foods UK is currently serving up a delicious handmade version in London stores.\n\nIf you have a glut of gourds, make your own at home from scratch (or source Libby\u2019s tinned pumpkin pie filling from Fine Food Specialist, \u00a32.90 for 425g, to make life easier). Happily, UK brands are cottoning on to our fixation with the flavour, and there are a number of other pumpkin spice-laced food products available here in Blighty \u2013 not least the New York Bakery Co\u2019s Hallowe\u2019en bagels\u2026\n\nHotel Chocolat pumpkin pie chocolates\n\n\u00a33.95 for 90g, hotelchocolat.com\n\nA rich white-chocolate case oozes with a convincing, sweet \u201cpumpkin ganache\u201d (6 per cent pumpkin pur\u00e9e) with plenty of cinnamon, almond praline and full cream, topped with a crumbly cornflake lid.\n\n10/10\n\nBird and Blend spiced pumpkin pie chai tea\n\n\u00a35.90 for 50g, bird andblendtea.com\n\nThis Great Taste award-winning Sri Lankan black tea blend can be prepared with milk on the stove or brewed in water like normal tea. It\u2019s cockle-warming and fragrant but made with carrot, rather than dried pumpkin.\n\n8/10\n\nMozart chocolate cream pumpkin spice liqueur\n\n\u00a315 for 50cl, Ocado\n\nA pumpkin-spice liqueur (70% ABV), made in Salzburg, Austria. The boozy orange liquid is a balance of cocoa, caramel, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, bourbon vanilla and just a hint of chilli. Like a pumpkin pie in a glass (but sickly if you have too much).\n\n7/10\n\nNew York Bagel Co pumpkin spice\n\n\u00a31 for five, Asda (in stores only)\n\nIn stores for a limited time, these dense wheat bagels make for a seasonal breakfast or snack, courtesy of dried pumpkin (2 per cent), spice extract and orange peel, with an inviting aroma that plumes from the toaster. Better with molten butter, rather than smoked salmon.\n\n9/10\n\nPoetic License pumpkin spice gin\n\n\u00a337.50 for 70cl, poeticlicense distillery.co.uk\n\nPart of the distiller\u2019s \u201crarity\u201d range, this limited edition gin (46% ABV) has a nose of nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin, giving way to juniper and a faint citrus twist, with a kick of ginger heat to round it off.\n\n9/10\n\nPip and Nut pumpkin spice almond butter\n\n\u00a33.95 for 225g, Sainsbury\u2019s\n\nAn almond, coconut and pumpkin-seed nut butter for toast and smoothies, seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and a sprinkle of salt. Very moreish, though a little oily: it clings to the roof of the mouth, and isn\u2019t quite pumpkiny enough.\n\n6/10", "description": "When your local coffee shop starts serving steaming cups of pumpkin spiced lattes (referred to as the Starbucks acronym \u201cPSL\u201d) you know it\u2019s that time of the year again.", "authors": ["Madeleine Howell"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/10/18/pumpkin-spice-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqeo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
