(AP) \u2014 When a blackface scandal nearly forced Gov. Ralph Northam from office in February, the folksy pediatrician became an instant pariah among fellow Democrats. A political death watch took shape as the governor used underground tunnels at the Capitol to stay out of sight.\n\nNow, nine months later, Northam is standing front and center on the campaign trail as he stumps for Democrats who once called for him to resign.\n\nLike Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2014 who was recently reelected in a stronger-than-expected showing after pictures of him in blackface surfaced \u2014 Northam has proven resilient to what many thought was a fatal scandal.\n\nOn Saturday morning, he was at a campaign canvass kickoff in Virginia Beach exhorting supporters to help Democrats flip control of the state legislature and send a message about the state\u2019s values.\n\n\u201cWe live in a very diverse society, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Northam said. \u201cIt\u2019s who we are. We\u2019re going to be inclusive. We\u2019re going to welcome people to Virginia.\u201d\n\nNortham drew repeated applause and laughter at a home packed with campaign volunteers, some of whom came from San Francisco to help Democrats win. Virginia is the only state having legislative elections this year where partisan control of the statehouse is up for grabs.\n\nFor several Democrats in the room, the yearbook scandal was a long-ago mistake outweighed by the governor\u2019s accomplishments and values. Those include passing Medicaid expansion and helping lure retail giant Amazon to set up a second headquarters in the state. Since the scandal, he\u2019s pledged to focus the rest of his term on addressing long-standing racial inequalities in a state that was home to the capital of the Confederacy and an anti-school integration effort known as Massive Resistance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful that Northam didn\u2019t resign,\u201d said Pat Gadzinski, who hosted Saturday\u2019s event at her home. \u201cI feel those were stupid mistakes he made as a kid. I think he\u2019s done great things.\u201d\n\nThe people who packed into the house were overwhelmingly white. But some black voters living nearby offered similar perspectives.\n\nMark Wade, 57, said the yearbook scandal pales in comparison to the drama surrounding the president.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got issues, everybody\u2019s got devils or demons,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially Trump.\u201d\n\nIt was a much different tune in February when there were nearly unanimous calls from within his own party to resign over the yearbook photo that shows someone in blackface and another person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe. He first admitted he was in the picture, and then the next day denied it, but also acknowledged putting on blackface to imitate Michael Jackson at a dance contest decades ago.\n\nHe quickly lost the support of virtually all of the state\u2019s Democratic establishment. Top Republicans in the Virginia General Assembly also urged Northam to step down, as did many Democrats who are now running for president.\n\nThe chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus said Northam had been \u201ccompletely dishonest and disingenuous.\u201d\n\nBut Northam was able to hold on, in part because the two Democrats next in line to replace him were soon enveloped in scandal of their own. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax was accused by two women of sexual assault, which he denied. And Attorney General Mark Herring revealed that he\u2019d also worn blackface as a young man.\n\nNortham has since won kudos for his work to address racial disparities in areas including criminal justice and maternal health.\n\nAt an August event commemorating the 400th anniversary of the first African slaves to arrive in Virginia, Northam delivered a keynote speech where he discussed confronting \u201cpainful truths\u201d of his own past. The speech received praise from African Americans.\n\nIn the run up to Election Day, the governor and First Lady Pam Northam have been spending their weekends helping fellow Democrats get out the vote and his political action committee has made five-figure donations to candidates in tough races. His PAC also recently launched a digital campaign ad entitled \u201cCourage\u201d that touts his record as governor and asks voters to support candidates who back his agenda.\n\nNortham is not on the ballot this year and isn\u2019t allowed under state law to seek a consecutive term. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll try to continue his political career once he leaves office in 2022, but helping Democrats win control of the statehouse could help him advance his agenda during the next two years.\n\nRepublicans have weaponized Northam\u2019s yearbook picture on the campaign trail, often featuring it prominently in attack ads focused on Democratic candidates who once called for Northam to resign but later took money from his PAC.\n\nGarren Shipley, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, said Republicans appreciate the chance to remind voters of the hypocrisy of Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cWe welcome Governor Northam back to the trail,\u201d Shipley said.\n\nLarry Barnett is running for a suburban Richmond House seat and who called for Northam to resign, but now says he\u2019s grateful for the governor\u2019s help. He said GOP attacks involving Northam fall flat because the scandal is \u201cold news.\u201d Barnett said he\u2019s glad Northam didn\u2019t resign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that he didn\u2019t, that he weathered that difficult, humiliating storm,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cHe\u2019s actually a very effective governor and is doing a lot to use his own painful experience to bring about good things for Virginians.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSuderman reported from Richmond, Virginia.", "description": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.
