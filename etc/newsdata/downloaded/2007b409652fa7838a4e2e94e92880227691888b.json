Authorities said the maneuver caused Harris to veer left into oncoming northbound traffic where her vehicle collided head-on with a white 2008 Jeep Liberty driven by 16-year-old Maria Elena Cruz.\n\nBoth drivers were pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the Avalanche was uninjured. Police said Pedro Cruz, a Taos County firefighter/EMT, responded to the scene and found his daughter dead upon arrival.\n\n\"At this time I will say with most certainty that [the 16-year-old] was an innocent victim of this senseless crash caused by Ms. Harris,\" Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement first reported by TaosNews.com and The Tennessean.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office reportedly suspects speed and intoxication were factors in the crash as well, but authorities are waiting to see the toxicology report from the Office of the Medical Investigator to make an official determination on the matter.\n\nCourt records indicate that Harris had a history of drinking and driving. In June 2017, she was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after records indicated she had a blood alcohol content level over 0.15, nearly twice the legal limit.
