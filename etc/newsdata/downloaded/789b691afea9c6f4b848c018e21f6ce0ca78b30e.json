Videos of the encounter show Acosta pulling back as the intern moved to take the microphone.\n\nThe White House later restored Acosta's press access, ending a lawsuit brought by CNN challenging the revocation as a violation of the reporter's constitutional rights. A judge had issued a temporary ruling in CNN's favor.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jan Wolfe and Susan Heavey, Editing by Franklin Paul and Steve Orlofsky)", "description": "Lawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump and his re-election campaign have threatened in a letter to sue CNN for what they said was the network falsely advertising itself as a news organization, calling on executives to first discuss an \"appropriate resolution\" to the matter that would include", "authors": ["Jan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z8H6EvUEaFk_6yjTWVjIQA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-312210-1571433163549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
