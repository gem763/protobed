LOUIS (AP) - Paul Goldschmidt had one of the best games of his career at an opportune time for the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nGoldschmidt hit a grand slam and a three-run homer to back Adam Wainwright, who pitched six innings of two-hit ball as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 10-0 on Friday night.\n\n\u201cMemorable for sure,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said of Goldschmidt\u2019s performance. \u201cThat\u2019s an obviously huge performance. He had a nice night, good swings, not trying to do too much.\n\n\u201cAlso give the guys credit in front of him. You\u2019ve got to have people on base to hit grand slams and three-run homers.\u201d\n\nThe win gave the Cardinals a five-game lead over the third-place Brewers in the NL Central. St. Louis remained four games ahead of the Chicago Cubs, who defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 17-8 on Friday.\n\nIt was the seventh win in the past nine home games for the Cardinals, who went 3-3 on a road trip leading up to Friday. The Brewers had their seven-game winning streak snapped and fell out of a tie with Chicago for the second wild card spot.\n\nWainwright (12-9) struck out seven and walked three. In his past three games, he\u2019s allowed one earned run in 20 innings.\n\nTrent Grisham led off the game with a single and Orlando Arcia singled with two outs in the second, accounting for both Milwaukee hits in the game.\n\n\u201cI knew it was coming,\u201d Wainwright said of his recent dominance. \u201cI knew the adjustments I was making were going to be good. I just needed to go out and execute and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do.\u201d\n\nAdrian Houser (6-6) lasted three innings. He gave up four hits including Goldschmidt\u2019s second grand slam of the season. He also struck out five and walked three. Goldschmidt connected on his second homer of the night and his 31st of the year in a six-run sixth. He cranked a 3-1 pitch from Jimmy Nelson to centerfield to record a career-high seven RBI. He now has 30 or more home runs in each of his past three seasons and five in his career.\n\nGoldschmidt has feasted on Milwaukee pitching. He\u2019s hitting .318 against the Brewers, with eight home runs and 20 RBI. He had a three homer game against the Brewers on March 29 in a 9-5 win at Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cI mean they\u2019ve got me, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey struck me out twice (tonight) and last series I didn\u2019t do that well against them. You face a team that many times there\u2019s going to be games where you have success and times they get you out and you just keep going back and forth and see what happens.\u201d\n\nHouser allowed just two base runners in the first two innings, both via walks. But Wainwright doubled down the left-field line with one out in the third, Dexter Fowler walked and Kolten Wong barely beat out a bunt single to load the bases in front of Goldschmidt.\n\nGoldschmidt lined a 2-2 pitch just over the left-field fence and into the Milwaukee bullpen for his first homer in 18 games.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel really comfortable out there on the mound,\u201d Houser said. \u201cAfter the second inning, I was able to try and turn the corner there but I wasn\u2019t able to repeat my mechanics. So, it wasn\u2019t a good night out there.\u201d\n\nWong had three hits in the game, including two bunts, and drove in two runs in the sixth to give St. Louis a 7-0 lead.\n\nThe Cardinals nearly had a second grand slam from pinch hitter Matt Carpenter earlier in the inning. Ben Gamel had to leap against the outfield wall to snag Carpenter\u2019s sacrifice fly that drove in Yadier Molina.\n\nREMEMBRANCE\n\nA video tribute and a moment of silence was held prior to the game to honor former Cardinal Chris Duncan who died Sept. 6 after a lengthy battle with brain cancer. Duncan played four full seasons with St. Louis from 2006-2009 and had an integral role in the team\u2019s 2006 World Series run.\n\nWINNING WAYS\n\nWith its 10-3 win at Colorado on Thursday, St. Louis clinched at least a .500 record for the 12th consecutive season, during which the Cardinals have the third-best record (1,067-861) in the Majors. St. Louis and the New York Yankees are the only teams without a losing season during that span. The 12-year streak is second best in franchise history behind a 15-year stretch from 1939-53.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: RHP Jordan Lyles (10-8, 4.38) has won five of eight, with two no decisions, since joining the Brewers in late July. Milwaukee is 7-1 in games Lyles has started since his trade from PIttsburgh, including a 4-1 decision over the Cardinals on August 28 in Milwaukee in which he lasted 51/3 and struck out nine.\n\nCardinals: RHP Jack Flaherty (10-7, 2.99) is coming off consecutive games in which he pitched eight scoreless innings and has earned the win in six of his past seven starts. His only loss during that stretch was the 4-1 decision on August 28 at Milwaukee where Flaherty gave up three runs over six innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Paul Goldschmidt had one of the best games of his career at an opportune time for the St. Louis Cardinals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jason L.
