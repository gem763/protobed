But the show went on and even with no official host, the flow was great, ending around 11 p.m. This was sooner than recent award shows that often run well over the three hours allotted.\n\nOne thing fans didn't seem to enjoy was Thomas Lennon, who did a voiceover after the winners were announced.\n\nMany on social media couldn't hear him or when they did, they didn't love his jokes.\n\nA Felicity Huffman joke and calling Chernobyl \"the little nuclear disaster that could\" fell flat Sunday night.\n\nRemember to invite your parents!\n\nIn a battle between \"Killing Eve\" co-stars, Jodie Comer bested Sandra Oh for lead actress in a drama series. And it came as a surprise even to Comer.\n\nComer thanked \"my mum and dad, who are in Liverpool, who I didn't invite because I didn't think this was going to be my time.\"\n\n\"One, I'm sorry; two, I love you,\" she said to her parents. \"I'm gonna bring it home.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old actress looked positively shocked when her name was called. She bested not only Oh, but also heavyweights Robin Wright, Emilia Clarke, Laura Linney and Viola Davis.\n\nOh gave her a big hug as she headed to the stage, where Comer repeatedly uttered \"This is crazy.\"\n\nPatricia Arquette sends strong message: 'Stop persecuting trans people'\n\nThe actress, who won the Emmy for best supporting actress in a limited series or movie for \"The Act,\" devoted her acceptance speech to late sister, transgender actress Alexis Arquette and the transgender community.\n\nAfter acknowledging that she is grateful to have work, she said that she is still \"so sad.\"\n\n.@PattyArquette talks to @arobach about grieving her late sister Alexis Arquette & using her #Emmy win as a platform for trans rights: \"You may not understand trans people. Open up the conversation. Open up your heart. And also lets start employing them.\" https://t.co/NVIxT9KvFX pic.twitter.com/nY0gJGGFCM \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cI lost my sister Alexis. And that trans people are still being persecuted. And I\u2019m in mourning every day of my life, Alexis,\" she said.\n\n\"And I will be for the rest of my life, for you, until we change the world so that trans people are not persecuted,\" she added.\n\nShe said the hate must stop. \"Give them jobs,\" she said about the trans community. \"They're human beings. Let's give them jobs. Let's get rid of the bias that we have everywhere.\"\n\nBilly Porter: 'You have the right'\n\nAfter winning his best actor Emmy, he began with, \"The category is love ya'll, love!!\"\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed and overjoyed to live long enough to see this day,\" he said about his role in \"Pose.\"\n\nAnd when talking about the LGBTQ community, he said, \"I have the right, you have the right, we all have the right.\"\n\nIt was a moment that made everyone stand up and cheer over.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nIn the process, Porter becomes the first openly gay black man to win lead actor in a drama.\n\nBackstage, he added, \"We have the power to create empathy through the way we tell stories. I know that being black and gay and out and being in this position and speaking from where I get to speak from is the change. I hope that young queer people of all colors can look at me and know [gets emotional] that they can. \"\n\nJharrel Jerome honors Central Park 5\n\nAn emotional Jharrel Jerome accepted the award for actor in a limited series for his role in \"When They See Us,\" the Ava DuVernay-directed series about the Central Park Five.\n\nJerome teared up as the entire crowd gave him -- and the series -- a standing ovation.\n\nThe move tells the story of the five teens who were arrested and convicted of an assault on a jogger in Central Park, only to be exonerated by DNA evidence years later.\n\n\"This is for the men we know as the 'Exonerated Five,'\" Jerome said on stage, tipping his Emmy.\n\nThe group was in the crowd and received loud applause as well.\n\n'Fleabag' wins big\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge, the creator and star of the BBC series \"Fleabag,\" was up on stage quite a lot Sunday night.\n\nShe earned individual awards for acting and writing, while the show also surprised favorites like \"Veep\" and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" to claim the award for best comedy.\n\nBut it was her comedy and charm on-stage each time that really made fans fall in love with this star in front of and behind the camera.", "description": "Billy Porter, the cast of", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/billy-porter-05-as-gty-190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
