Ten Labour MPs have declared their intention to support the proposal, along with enough Tory rebels returning to get to a majority of two, even without the DUP. That\u2019s an early assumption, however, and a key loss on a procedural motion might throw a spanner into the works for Johnson tomorrow.\n\nFor now, though, Johnson looks like he\u2019s building a winning coalition:\n\nAnd now there were 10: @OnnMel is backing Boris' deal. By our numbers, Boris Johnson has a majority of *two* for his deal tomorrow https://t.co/2DBWj354Bc \u2014 Sebastian Payne (@SebastianEPayne) October 18, 2019\n\nOnn partnered up with Tory MP Victoria Prentis on an op-ed to urge unity in getting Brexit done and \u201cmove on\u201d:\n\nLast month, we came together with colleagues across the house to find a middle ground between the extremes of no deal and a second referendum. Our mission was to give a voice to the silent majority \u2013 both in parliament and across the country \u2013 a voice to those who respect the result of the referendum, and who want us to leave with a deal and move on. \u2026 That\u2019s why we have decided to write together the day before this historic sitting \u2013 not just as a proof that MPs of different stripes can work together, but to implore our colleagues to use this unique chance to help us move on, and get back to helping our constituents. A no-deal Brexit will risk their prosperity, and a second referendum will only deepen the schism of the past three years. Pride needs to be swallowed on both sides, and clear heads must prevail. The risk of letting this final shot at a deal slip through our fingers is too great. Our collective hope rests on brave Labour MPs, and indeed others, who can see that.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a word in this essay that supports any of the elements of the deal, nor a single word about Boris Johnson. Still, it appears that the momentum has swung his way and that Johnson\u2019s deal might still pass.\n\nThat might not be the end of it, however. Some apparently suspected that Johnson might try to use this version of a deal as a stalking-horse for a later no-deal Brexit. Johnson\u2019s government lost a vote to keep the authorizing bill from being amended, and Parliament began attaching conditions to the deal. The most significant of this is one offered by MP Oliver Letwin that suspends approval of the deal until the government passes enabling legislation, which is separate from the approval that may pass tomorrow:\n\nThe amendment would withhold approval of the deal, until the legislation to enact it was safely passed \u2013 a move that would automatically trigger the \u201cBenn Act\u201d and force the prime minister to request a further postponement of Brexit until 31 January. \u2026 Sir Oliver\u2019s amendment is a cunningly-crafted proposition which, crucially, could be voted for by MPs who want a deal, but don\u2019t trust this one, and don\u2019t trust the government. It rests on the idea that were Parliament to approve the deal for the purposes of the Benn Act now, there might then be a danger that the subsequent legislation to enact it might be, somehow, derailed, resulting in a no-deal exit on 31 October. With the Benn Act out of the way, they believe that some manoeuvre, some legislative judo move, by factions inside and outside the government, who favour a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d could leave no time for any effective counter\u2026 and Britain would be out, with no deal.\n\nThe perceived need to seek such a guarantee in legislation speaks to a profound lack of trust in Johnson and his fellow Brexit hardliners. Given all of the machinations on all sides over Brexit to this point, it\u2019s hardly outside of the realm of possibility that Johnson could have been angling for a way to get to a no-deal Brexit by finding a way to get around the Benn Act. That would have been a clever ploy, one that would have enabled Johnson to avoid some of the political damage for splitting off Northern Ireland as he has in this current version of the deal while still claiming to have delivered a functional Brexit deal.\n\nLetwin insists he\u2019s not trying to scupper the deal but to save it:\n\n\u201cMy aim is to ensure that Boris\u2019s deal succeeds, but that we have an insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation,\u201d Letwin said in an explanatory note sent to reporters.\n\nIt might, however, be a poison pill in the end that some Brexiters can\u2019t swallow. At the very least, tomorrow\u2019s sitting might end up being more academic than climactic:\n\nForcing the PM to ask for a delay even if MPs have voted for the deal certainly changes the dynamics around tomorrow \u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) October 18, 2019\n\nBiggest decision about tomorrow is what the govt decides to do if Letwin amendment passes. Do they pull the whole motion? Or proceed with it, knowing it no longer constitutes a meaningful vote? \u2014 Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) October 18, 2019\n\nThis assumes that the EU would grant another extension, a point that is far from established. However, it would be almost automatically granted if Parliament passed the authorization and needed a little more time for the enabling legislation to pass; certainly the EU would not jeopardize their own interests in a pedantic argument over the deadline with nothing else at stake. With that as the context and another no-deal escape hatch closed, will hardline Brexiters come along with Johnson? At least one of them announced this afternoon that she\u2019ll throw in with the government on the deal:\n\nAfter much consideration, I have decided to back @BorisJohnson deal. Obviously I would prefer No-Deal but I believe we are in real danger of losing Brexit with the Remain shenanigans and the stakes are dangerously high at the moment.
