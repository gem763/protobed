Danforth\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green\n\n\ud83d\udcda Butter, by Erin Jade Lange\n\n(New York Public Library)\n\nBringing the racy, popular novels of the past into America\u2019s schools\n\n\u201cPurely by looking at the more popular titles from this time, a student might receive a surprisingly diverse and even radical portrait of early 18th- and 19th-century people and morals.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcdaHagar, by Alice Cary\n\n\ud83d\udcda Mary Lyndon, by Mary Gove Nichols\n\n\ud83d\udcda Clotel, or the President\u2019s Daughter, by William Wells Brown\n\n\ud83d\udcdaWieland, by Charles Brockden Brown\n\n\ud83d\udcdaThe Coquette, by Hannah Webster Foster\n\n\ud83d\udcdaHope Leslie, by Catharine Sedgwick\n\n\ud83d\udcdaClarence, by Catharine Sedgwick\n\n\ud83d\udcdaThe Garies and Their Friends, by Frank J. Webb\n\nHow banning books marginalizes children\n\n\u201cWhen librarians and teachers reject works that may be \u2018emotionally inappropriate\u2019 for children (a common reason), they\u2019re adhering to the traditional and mostly prevailing view that children\u2019s literature should avoid controversial topics.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Harry Potter series, by J. K. Rowling\n\n\ud83d\udcda I Am Jazz, by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings\n\n\ud83d\udcda Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain\n\n\ud83d\udcdaTo Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Seventh Wish, by Kate Messner\n\nLiterature\u2019s emotional lessons\n\n\u201cEnglish teachers don\u2019t teach these important stories because they want to batter students with the darkness in human nature \u2026 Academic goals aside, fellow teachers told me they want to help students cope with real life\u2014even when portions of that reality are unpleasant and disturbing.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda Lord of the Flies, by William Golding\n\n\ud83d\udcda Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe\n\n\ud83d\udcda Beloved, by Toni Morrison\n\n\ud83d\udcda Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, by Harriet Jacobs\n\n\ud83d\udcda Othello, by William Shakespeare\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Stranger, by Albert Camus\n\nThe case for rereading the high-school classics\n\n\u201cThese books are here for you, they will always be there for you. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of serenity in that.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda Practical Classics: 50 Reasons to Reread 50 Books You Haven\u2019t Touched Since High School, by Kevin Smokler\n\n\ud83d\udcda Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Catcher in the Rye, by J. D. Salinger\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, by Carson McCullers\n\nThe Reference Desk\n\n(New York Public Library)\n\nThis week\u2019s question comes from Pamela, who\u2019s looking for a book similar to The Rector\u2019s Wife\u2014Joanna Trollope\u2019s novel about a woman\u2019s unhappy marriage and sexual awakening\u2014but one that focuses on a same-sex relationship.\n\nA long tradition of books explores the connections and tensions between religion and sexuality, and perhaps one of these options might satisfy the sort of reading experience you\u2019re looking for. Jeanette Winterson\u2019s Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, a coming-of-age tale about a lesbian girl growing up in an English Pentecostal community, sets the protagonist\u2019s personal journey against a background of religious zeal. The Well of Loneliness, by Radclyffe Hall, which is credited with bringing increased visibility to lesbians in England and America when it was released in 1928, is a love story imbued with the author\u2019s Christian beliefs. And, as briefly mentioned above, The Miseducation of Cameron Post examines the conflict that sometimes exists between conservative beliefs and homosexual identity through the story of a young girl sent to so-called conversion therapy.", "description": "Required reading, updated: Your weekly guide to the best in books", "authors": ["Tori Latham"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTXPCFN/facebook.jpg?1566311556"}
