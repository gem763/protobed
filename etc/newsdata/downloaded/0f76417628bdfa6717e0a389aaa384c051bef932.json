Germany, for instance, has an unemployment rate of 5 percent. It's worse when you compare the French numbers to the U.S. unemployment rate of 3.5 percent (as of October).\n\nFrance's \"moderate\" gains are not exactly cause for celebration, according to some economic experts.\n\n\u201cWhilst the moderate fall in the French unemployment rate may be welcome for Macron, it is the very weak GDP growth numbers that will be of great concern,\u201d said Lorne Baring, managing director at Geneva-based investment firm B Capital. \u201cThe French economy advanced only 0.2 percent in the last quarter, easing from 0.3 percent growth in the previous period and missing market expectations. The question is whether both France and Germany can exit the malaise that is ringing recession alarm bells for investors,\u201d added Baring. (Reuters)\n\nThe U.S. rate, meanwhile, is at its lowest in 50 years. A French reporter asked President Trump about the discrepancy on Thursday as he toured a new Louis Vuitton workshop in Keene, Texas.\n\n\u201cYou have a very low unemployment rate in the US and we have a very high unemployment rate in France,\" she noted. \"How come?\u201d\n\nHe didn't hesitate, providing this quick witted answer.\n\nFrench reporter: \"You have very low unemployment rate in the US and we have very high unemployment rate in France. How come? What the recipe for?\"\n\n\n\nTrump: \"Well maybe we have a better President than you do\" ??#DonaldTrump #DallasTrumpRally #unemployment pic.twitter.com/mrekB08fZV \u2014 Eddie Donovan, Ph.D. ????

Some people wondered who would benefit from the new workshop, where handbags would all be printed with \"Made in the USA.\"\n\nAgain, a simple answer.", "description": ".10/19/2019 7:00:57AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/290/846d8cdc-0c91-4212-8ad1-f94c2a5ba8bb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
