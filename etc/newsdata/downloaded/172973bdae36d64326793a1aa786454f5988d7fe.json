These places, The Post found, are far more likely to have schools that mirror the new diversity of their communities than their big-city counterparts, which have long been home to a diverse population but have run schools that are profoundly segregated.\n\nWhile segregation in parts of America has persisted, the number of students affected has inched up only slightly. Out of 46.4 million public school students, about 5.8 million attended schools that were not integrated in 2017.\n\nMore students today are in districts with integrated schools The proportion of students by school district integration Somewhat integrated Not diverse enough or too small to integrate Highly integrated Not integrated 1995 14% 14% 13% 59% 2017 13% 23% 22% 42% More students today are in districts with integrated schools The proportion of students by school district integration Somewhat integrated Not diverse enough or too small to integrate Highly integrated Not integrated 1995 14% 14% 13% 59% 2017 13% 23% 22% 42% More students today are in districts with integrated schools The proportion of students by school district integration Somewhat integrated Not diverse enough or too small to integrate Highly integrated Not integrated 1995 13% 14% 14% 59% 2017 13% 23% 22% 42% More students today are in districts with integrated schools The proportion of students by school district integration Somewhat integrated Not diverse enough or too small to integrate Highly integrated Not integrated 1995 13% 14% 14% 59% 2017 13% 23% 22% 42%\n\n[See the full data analysis: More students are attending schools with children of different races than ever before.]\n\nThe change is underway in places like Colorado\u2019s Roaring Fork Valley near Aspen. Twenty-five years ago, the valley\u2019s school district was 12 percent Latino. Now, Latinos represent more than half of all kids.\n\nUnlike in big cities such as Denver, on the other side of the Rocky Mountains, white and Latino children in Roaring Fork are not segregated by school. Each building roughly reflects the district as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe kept tinkering and working on this,\u201d said Rob Stein, superintendent of the Roaring Fork School District. \u201cWe want our schools to look like our community.\u201d\n\nCarbondale is a town in Colorado's Roaring Fork Valley, where schools are highly integrated.

(Nick Cote for The Washington Post) RIGHT: In Denver, schools have long been segregated. (Rick Wilking/Reuters)\n\nDuring this period of rapid diversification, the overall U.S. public school population increased by 6 percent. The Post analysis included all of the nation\u2019s 13,184 traditional public school districts. Not included are about 5.8 million children who attend private or religious schools, 3 million in public charter schools and those not enrolled in school.\n\nThe Post analysis comes as the race for the Democratic presidential nomination has focused attention on the nation\u2019s troubled history of segregated education. Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s opposition to federally mandated busing of children in the 1970s has drawn scorn from some rivals, and the debate has spurred conversation over how to mitigate the segregation that remains in schools.\n\nThe challenge becomes more urgent as the United States approaches a demographic tipping point. Next year, the Census Bureau predicts, whites will no longer constitute a majority of American children. With that shift comes important questions: Can increasing diversity help U.S. schools shed their legacy of segregation, or will children continue to be clustered by race and ethnicity 65 years after the Supreme Court declared in Brown v. Board of Education that separate schools are \u201cinherently unequal\u201d?\n\nMany of the nation\u2019s heavily segregated districts are in the largest cities. Denver schools are typical. They were integrated after a federal court ordered busing in 1973 but resegregated almost immediately after the order was lifted in 1995. Segregation has climbed steadily ever since. Efforts to push for integration in Denver have been halting, even as white families arrive into the gentrifying city.\n\n\u201cWe have unequal housing, segregated housing by design and by law,\u201d said Van Schoales, president of A+ Colorado, a research and advocacy group in Denver. \u201cAfter busing ended, [school] boundary lines were drawn, and they reinforced the existing housing patterns.\u201d That\u2019s partly because families, frustrated by their experience with court-mandated desegregation and busing, demanded neighborhood schools.\n\nResearch shows integration benefits children of all races, who learn to appreciate diversity, producing lifelong benefits. It also shows that children of color do better academically and that white students do no worse when they attend diverse schools.\n\nIntegration isn\u2019t always possible: Many U.S. school districts don\u2019t have enough diversity to integrate, even if they want to.\n\nSome of that homogeneity is driven by school system boundary lines. Districts face no obligation to educate kids who live outside their borders, and wealthy families often band together in districts.\n\nSchools in Birmingham, Ala., are 91 percent black, for instance, while neighboring Mountain Brook schools are 96 percent white. Students do not cross the line that divides them.\n\nTo conduct its analysis, The Post used data from the U.S. Education Department to examine how many of the nation\u2019s school systems have sufficient diversity to create integrated schools. In 1995, the first year for which comprehensive data are available, 20 percent of districts \u2014 including 45 percent of all public school students \u2014 were diverse. To be considered a diverse district, no one race can constitute more than 75 percent of students.\n\nBy 2017, the most recent year of data, the number of diverse districts had risen sharply: Nearly 4 in 10 school districts, educating two-thirds of all public school students, had enough diversity to make integration possible, assuming the political will.\n\nBut just because a school system is diverse, that doesn\u2019t mean its schools are integrated.\n\nAre diverse districts creating and maintaining diverse schools? Or do all the white kids remain clustered in certain schools, with black and brown students in others, just like when the Rev. Oliver Brown won his lawsuit against the segregated schools of Topeka, Kan., in 1954?\n\nThe Post grouped diverse school districts into three categories \u2014 highly integrated, somewhat integrated and not integrated \u2014 using a measure called the variance ratio, which assesses how frequently students of the same race attend schools together, given the district\u2019s demographics.\n\nIn highly integrated districts, individual schools most closely reflect the demographics of the district as a whole. In districts that are not integrated, some schools are dominated by one race and others by another. The somewhat integrated districts are in between.\n\nThe number of students in the highly and somewhat integrated groups increased significantly. The rise was especially robust in the most integrated group, with 83 percent more students \u2014 a total of 10.8 million \u2014 attending these schools than in 1995. The increase in the somewhat integrated group was 67 percent.\n\nThe most segregated group barely changed.\n\n[See how your school district compares to the rest of the country.]\n\nIn historically diverse districts such as Denver \u2014 typically big and midsize cities \u2014 segregation was high and grew slightly higher.\n\nBut segregation was far lower in districts that grew diverse between 1995 and 2017. These are typically small cities and suburbs that used to be mostly white and where Latinos and, to a lesser extent, African Americans have moved. Experts cite a number of possible explanations, including that whites may harbor less bias and be more willing to live alongside Latinos than they are African Americans.\n\n\u201cThose newly diverse districts are encouraging. The key thing is how do we help them stay integrated and not transition?\u201d said Erica Frankenberg, who directs the Center for Education and Civil Rights at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cThat\u2019s a potential opportunity. We don\u2019t have to undo bad patterns that have formed. We just have to keep them stable.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe location for Riverview School was selected in part because it could easily draw a mix of students. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\nIntegration in the Roaring Fork Valley\n\nThe diverging trends are clear in two Colorado school districts, set on either side of the Continental Divide: Roaring Fork and Denver.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the Roaring Fork Valley was overwhelmingly white. As the ski mecca of Aspen boomed, Latino families began arriving in large numbers, drawn to jobs in construction, hospitality and landscaping. Aspen housing was far too expensive, so many families commute from towns down the valley: Basalt, Carbondale and Glenwood Springs. Together, they make up the Roaring Fork School District.\n\nThe valley\u2019s regional hub is Glenwood Springs, set at the juncture of the Roaring Fork and Colorado rivers and named for hot springs thought to possess medicinal powers. It once was a Wild West town known for coal mines, saloons and brothels. Today, there\u2019s a cancer-treatment center, a row of car dealerships, a Walmart and a coffee house serving three types of avocado toast. But this is far from the big city. In springtime, black bears emerge from hibernation to mess with garbage bins. Street parking in the center of town is free.\n\n\n\nRob Stein is the superintendent of the Roaring Fork School District. In 1975, after his family moved to Denver, Stein was bused to Manual High School, in the heart of the city\u2019s historically black community. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\nManaging the school district is the 59-year-old Stein, who lived through a tumultuous era of school desegregation as a student. When Stein was in eighth grade, his white Jewish family moved into the Denver school district, just as court-ordered desegregation was beginning. In 1975, Stein was bused to Manual High School, in the heart of Denver\u2019s historically black community.\n\nIt was a wrenching time for the city, marked by white flight, but not for Stein. \u201cThere was a strong social justice orientation in my family, so it was very hard to oppose integration,\u201d Stein said.\n\nAfter the court order was lifted in 1995, Manual resegregated. Last year, almost no white students attended the school.\n\nStein has found integration far easier in Roaring Fork. That\u2019s largely because housing in the Roaring Fork Valley is more integrated. Latinos and whites live throughout all three towns.\n\nIn Glenwood Springs, a trailer park populated mostly by Latinos sits not far from spacious, newly developed single-family homes. Two apartment buildings sit side by side across from a strip mall on the west side of town \u2014 one rents high-end apartments; the other offers federally subsidized affordable units. And the community is small enough that people naturally mix in their daily lives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one City Market in the middle of town where everyone shops,\u201d Stein said.\n\nNot every integrated district is actively trying to meld students from different racial and ethnic groups. But there are deliberate efforts to do so in Roaring Fork. In 2016, the district was deciding where to build an elementary school. One option was the west side of Glenwood Springs, a growing area that is home to many low-income Latino families.\n\nStein feared a school there would quickly segregate, partly because white families would hesitate to cross the Colorado River to send their children into a majority Latino area. Instead, the district opted to build Riverview School on the other side of town, where it could more easily draw a mix of students. Administrators then redrew the boundaries for the district\u2019s elementary schools to balance the student populations.\n\n\n\nEight-year-old Anabelle Torres, left, works with her language partner, 9-year-old Klarissa Lozoya, at Riverview School. \u201cWhenever things get hard in Spanish, she comes help me,\u201d Anabelle said about Klarissa. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\nAt Riverview, classes in kindergarten through third grade are taught half the day in English and half in Spanish, and children are assigned language partners to help each other.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a Spanish speaker, and I\u2019m the complete opposite,\u201d said Anabelle Torres, 8, gesturing toward her friend Klarissa Lozoya. \u201cWhenever things get hard in Spanish, she comes help me. We partner up, and we help each other.\u201d\n\nOvert tensions are rare, residents say, maybe because the economy is booming and immigrant labor is fueling the growth. Still, some have that unsettling sense the place has changed.\n\n\u201cThere used to be two saloons, and old-timers could still spit on the floor,\u201d said Mike Blair, 84, who is white and has lived in the area more than 50 years. \u201cSo many people are new; it\u2019s not as comfortable or friendly as it used to be.\u201d Still, he says, the newcomers have not caused problems, and he happily lives in a trailer park with many Latino families. \u201cThey are very attentive to their property. It doesn\u2019t become a poor, crowded slum area like people feared.\u201d\n\nStill, three public charter schools in the district are disproportionately white, as are two private schools.\n\nCensus data show that 46 percent of all 5- to 17-year-olds living in the district are white, but just 41 percent of students in the traditional public schools are white, suggesting a number of families are opting for alternatives.\n\n\n\nAt the Carbondale Community charter school, just 21 of its 135 students last year were Latino. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the charters, Carbondale Community School, offers classes of 15 students, a school garden, outdoor education and schoolwide \u201cmindful Monday\u201d meetings, where the students form a circle and reaffirm principles such as social justice, responsibility and community. The school\u2019s goal is to develop better global citizens, said Principal Sam Richings-Germain, who is white.\n\nBut last year, just 21 of its 135 students were Latino. Students are chosen by lottery, and the principal says she has tried to figure out why more Latinos don\u2019t apply. She wonders if it might be the $525 student fee, although the school waives it for low-income families. Families must transport children to school, which could be another barrier.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like people to think of us as a white-flight school,\u201d Richings-Germain said. She said families choose her school based not on race or ethnicity, but because \u201cthey are just looking for something different.\u201d\n\nFor the past few years, the school has given preference in the lottery for kindergarten to children whose primary home language is not English. At first, it yielded only one or two Latino students, but this past spring, the school received six applications from Latino families. All were admitted for this fall.\n\nShare of Hispanic students in Roaring Fork more than quadrupled since 1995 Proportion of students in Roaring Fork by race in public schools, excluding charters Other Hispanic 12% 56% White 87% 41% 1995 2000 2005 2010 2017 Share of Hispanic students in Roaring Fork more than quadrupled since 1995 Proportion of students in Roaring Fork by race in public schools, excluding charters Other Hispanic 12% 56% White 87% 41% 1995 2000 2005 2010 2017 Share of Hispanic students in Roaring Fork more than quadrupled since 1995 Proportion of students in Roaring Fork by race in public schools, excluding charters Other 12% Hispanic 56% 87% White 41% 1995 2000 2005 2010 2017 Share of Hispanic students in Roaring Fork more than quadrupled since 1995 Proportion of students in Roaring Fork by race in public schools, excluding charters Other Hispanic 12% 56% White 87% 41% 1995 2000 2005 2010 2017\n\nAs the Latino population has grown, its members have been slow to assert their potential power. Some are in the country illegally and purposefully avoid attention. Some don\u2019t speak English, and that keeps them isolated. Until recently, serving on the part-time town council required taking a day off from work, every other Thursday. The council is entirely white.\n\nOne Latina mother told the story of her daughter, who loved volleyball but could not make the varsity team at Glenwood Springs High School. It turns out, most white girls had been playing private club volleyball for years, something the mom didn\u2019t know about and would have had trouble affording. She complained but ultimately let the matter drop.\n\nA few years later, her younger daughter, along with three Latina friends, failed to make the basketball team, even though the mom had spent $600 or $700 on a basketball camp. The mother, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is living in the United States without authorization, was scared to complain again, but she did.\n\nShe challenged the principal, Paul Freeman, to look at recent yearbooks and said it was not until then that Freeman realized there were no Latina athletes on the volleyball or basketball teams. In an interview, Freeman said that he knew about the gaps before then but that looking at the photos reinforced the point.\n\nFreeman sent the mother to Stein, who encouraged her to organize like-minded parents to press for change. The mother is working with a community group called Mountain Voices. \u201cI was quiet for years, scared because of immigration,\u201d she said, adding that she hopes to work with Stein toward equity.\n\nIn a separate interview, Stein made clear that, while he will help, it will be up to this mother, and her peers, to press for change. The lesson of busing, he said, is that improvements must be based on relationships, not on policies. They must spring from the community, not be imposed.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t whack-a-mole every problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be about people coming together and finding their highest priorities.\u201d\n\n\n\nCommunity educator Sade Cooper helps fifth-graders with English at Stedman Elementary School in Denver. The school has grown more diverse in recent years. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\nIn Denver, segregation persists\n\nManual High, where Rob Stein was bused, is still open, though barely. Enrollment has dwindled to about 300 students. It\u2019s one of many segregated schools that make Denver among the most segregated districts in the nation.\n\nA decade after busing ended, enrollment had fallen, test scores were abysmal, experiments had been tried and failed. The district closed the campus, hoping for a reboot but enraging the community, which was protective of its school. The district hired Stein, who was then principal at an elite private school, to try to execute a turnaround as principal of Manual.\n\nStein said he was making progress but was also frustrated by various matters and quit in 2010 after three years.\n\nNow, the school again faces jeopardy. After recording low test scores for five years in a row, the school is likely to be subject to state intervention, which could include closure, conversion to a charter school or new management.\n\nAsked to offer his school\u2019s strengths and challenges, Principal Joe Glover mentions just one strength \u2014 a recent state championship in basketball. Walking the hallways, he admonishes students to get to class and says he\u2019s working on attendance. Turning the corner, he finds a teacher with good news to report.\n\n\n\nEncouraged by teacher Jeny Garst to share his good news, Manual High School junior Andre Jackson tells Principal Joe Glover that his SAT score in math jumped 140 points. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cTell him how much you improved in math!\u201d teacher Jeny Garst, beaming, urges one of her students as Glover approaches. Andre Jackson, a junior, sheepishly reports that his math SAT score jumped by 140 points, improving to 470 out of a possible 800.\n\nJackson said he was helped by a change in the schedule. Now, he is in math class every day. It used to be offered only every other day. He\u2019s still short of the school goal of 530 \u2014 \u201cbut not by much,\u201d Garst says.\n\nGlover, who is white, says he\u2019s not focused on his school\u2019s demographics and is not trying to diversify the school. \u201cWe can be successful with the students we have in the building right now,\u201d he said. His concern, he said, is expanding enrollment. \u201cThe community wants Manual to be successful.\u201d\n\nFive miles away is Carson Elementary, where 76 percent of students are white. The school has grown so popular with families in its wealthy neighborhood that Carson can accept only a handful of children from outside its boundaries.\n\n\u201cFamilies are pulling students from private schools to [attend] the Carson school,\u201d said Principal Anne Larkin, who is white. The parent-teacher association raises more than $100,000 a year to pay for an additional teacher, field trips and classroom materials.\n\nThe front hallway features a large bin for families to donate used clothing and shoes. In a first-grade classroom, students write riddles describing birds. \u201cThis bird can fly backwards,\u201d one boy writes, hinting at a hummingbird.\n\n\u201cI like this school because it\u2019s full of kind people,\u201d said Ava Gardenswartz, a first-grader. She adds another positive: \u201cWhen our teacher gives us a math test, she makes sure we know the stuff on the math test before the test.\u201d\n\n\n\nMath teacher Cynthia Smith helps her third-grade students at Carson Elementary School, where 76 percent of students are white. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\nThe history of segregation in Denver can be traced to how the school board drew campus boundary lines after a federal court in 1995 lifted the busing order. Busing spurred white flight, and powerful Denver residents of all races were calling for a return to neighborhood schools.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming sentiment in the community was, 'We want our neighborhood schools,\u2019\u201d said Laura Lefkowits, who was on the school board at the time. Because housing was segregated, the results were predictable. \u201cThe voices for maintaining some integration, like mine, were very few and far between.\u201d\n\nA particularly tricky question was where to put the boundary between Manual, a traditionally black school, and Denver East High School, viewed as desirable by white families, then and now. One board member noted that if school zones were separated by York Street, which runs north-south, both schools would be more racially balanced. But doing so would have put wealthy white neighborhoods in the Manual territory.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the board members laughed at him,\u201d said Alan Gottlieb, who covered the meeting as a reporter for the Denver Post and is now an education consultant.\n\nInstead, the board created an anvil-like shape for Manual\u2019s boundary, surrounded on three sides by neighborhoods that would feed into Denver East. The result was Manual would serve a high-poverty, almost exclusively black and Latino area. Middle-class African Americans, once a significant part of the area, had largely moved away.\n\nDenver\u2019s level of segregation immediately climbed after the busing order was lifted and has been on the rise since. In 2017, Denver was among the nation\u2019s most segregated districts.\n\nTwo high schools less than two miles apart, serving very different student populations The proportion of white people by census block group for attendance zones for Manual and East high schools.

White parents are typically wealthier, better educated and better positioned to take advantage of options, experts say. The choice system allows them to flock to disproportionately white schools and was designed, some say, to attract white families to the city.\n\n\u201cOne unintended consequence of school choice is, if you don\u2019t have certain means or you are unable to navigate the system of choice, then you don\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d said Allen Smith, Denver\u2019s senior deputy superintendent for equity until June.\n\nIn 2017, a city commission called Strengthening Neighborhoods made recommendations for better integrating the schools. They included providing transportation to increase access to schools and changing the way students are assigned to schools. So far, critics say, the ideas have mostly been ignored.\n\nSome say segregation in Denver would be even worse without the system of choice that gives lower-income families access to schools outside their neighborhoods. Tom Boasberg, Denver\u2019s superintendent from 2009 to 2018, pointed to enrollment zones that allow some families to select a school from a larger geographic area as a way to balance each building\u2019s demographics.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the data, it\u2019s very clear school choice leads to increases in integration,\u201d Boasberg said.\n\nNot all Denver schools are segregated. Leaders at Denver Green School, just over a mile from Carson Elementary, work to recruit a diverse student body and are helped by the school\u2019s location in a more diverse neighborhood. The school\u2019s focus on project-based learning and environmental concerns has also drawn white families to choose it.\n\n\n\nParaeducator Emily George helps third-grader Rishon Harvey at Denver Green School, which has recruited a diverse student body even as the district overall has remained segregated.

A wheel created by a girl named Zakia shows a family of five, lists favorites like swimming, reading and ice cream, and declares, \u201cI am Muslim,\u201d and \u201cI speak Arabic,\u201d all surrounding a self-portrait.\n\nParents who send their children to schools that are more segregated have a range of explanations. At Park Hill Elementary, the student body is nearly three-quarters white and few spots exist for students outside its affluent boundaries. Michelle Scott, president of the parent-teacher association, said she is troubled by the inequities that stem from this concentration of privilege. Her group raises about $200,000 a year to add staff and raise salaries at the school.\n\n\u201cBecause we raise so much money and we give so much directly to the building, we have more staff. We have better test scores. We have higher achieving children,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, I\u2019ll admit it.\u201d\n\nBut she also values a neighborhood school, where parents meet one another on the playground, and said she would hesitate to send her children to a school that wasn\u2019t close by. \u201cYou should be able to get up and walk your kid to school,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nIn 1995, after a federal court order mandating busing was lifted, Manual High School resegregated. Last year, almost no white students attended the school. (Nick Cote for The Washington Post)\n\nThe choices they make\n\nA range of factors may explain why newly diverse communities are more integrated than communities that have long had a diversity of students.\n\nIt starts with housing. When people live in the same neighborhoods, they are significantly more likely to go to the same schools.\n\nLatinos have never been as segregated from whites as African Americans, experts say, and there is some evidence that white attitudes are less biased regarding Latinos. Urban housing patterns were established at a time when African Americans faced overt discrimination in government housing programs, zoning and mortgage lending. It was under those circumstances that neighborhoods were branded as home to people of one race or another.\n\nBut as Latinos arrive in communities, they may encounter more acceptance and a less hostile legal landscape.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been this idea in the community that, \u2018This is where the Latinos live.\u2019 It\u2019s new and in flux,\u201d said William H. Frey, a demographics expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIn these small communities, things just aren\u2019t as balkanized as they are in other places.\u201d\n\nIn addition, white parents in smaller places who are unhappy about diversity have fewer alternatives. These areas are more isolated, with fewer nearby school districts, making moving more complicated. There are fewer private schools.\n\nAnd most of these newly diverse areas are still majority white, and whites are sometimes more comfortable with diversity as long as they are still dominant.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tipping point at which whites are no longer comfortable, and they\u2019ll start to leave,\u201d said Kori J. Stroub, a research scientist at the Houston Education Research Consortium, a partnership between Rice University and Houston-area school districts.\n\nIn these rapidly diversifying communities, parents of all races find themselves with decisions to make.\n\nIn Glenwood Springs, the city\u2019s mayor, Jonathan Godes, 41, said he was tempted to enroll his two children in the Carbondale Community School, a charter that is a 12-mile drive to the next town. Godes, who is white, said he is worried so many privileged families were choosing private and charter schools, leaving the traditional schools with an overrepresentation of Latino children.\n\nHis neighborhood school, Sopris Elementary, is 45 percent Latino, and 39 percent of students come from families poor enough to qualify for the federal free and reduced-price lunch program, according to state data.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a 10-point difference in math and reading scores, all ideas of public education and neighborhood schools go out the window,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the end, he was persuaded by convenience: Sopris is a three-minute walk from home.\n\n\u201cI have been very pleased. Great teachers and awesome administrators,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife and I comment pretty regularly on how stupid it would\u2019ve been to send our kids anywhere else.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan Godes, the mayor of Glenwood Springs, walks daughters Nolah, 9, and Addison, 11, to school. Godes said he was tempted to enroll them in a charter school in Carbondale but went with their neighborhood school, which is 45 percent Latino.
