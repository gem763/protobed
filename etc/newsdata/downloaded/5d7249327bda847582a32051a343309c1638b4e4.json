(Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nOccasional Air Force layovers at a Trump hotel in Scotland, which were started under Obama, are a pathetic excuse for an expos\u00e9.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to be an investigative reporter. Everybody who feeds you a tip has an axe to grind. Or, alternatively, you find yourself going, \u201cI wonder if . . . ?\u201d You put in your research, you talk to lots of people, you accumulate a huge pile of information, but you still haven\u2019t proved your hypothesis. A wise reporter says to herself either \u201cI don\u2019t have the story yet\u201d or \u201cI guess this didn\u2019t pan out.\u201d In either event, she doesn\u2019t publish. More likely, since reporters always think they have the story and always want to publish, an editor says, \u201cKid, you haven\u2019t got the story.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the many rules of the road that have changed in the Trump era is that reporters have taken to blasting out their BREAKING NEWS about scandals that they haven\u2019t actually proven to be scandals. There is so much hay to be made during this administration, so many reporters are becoming superstars, so many comfy houses in Bethesda are being bought with so many large book deals. Any fresh angle you can find on the iniquity of the administration is going to be lapped up eagerly by everyone you know. But what if your new angle isn\u2019t . . . actually. . . the truth?\n\nDanger lurks. It\u2019s damned annoying how many watchmen there are to watch the watchmen these days. But in the end the temptation wins. The shaky story gets blasted out to everyone, it falls apart, and the soiled and tattered reputation of the news media acquires another stain. Short term, no biggie: Reporters know they won\u2019t get fired for being wrong. They get a little dopamine hit of glory from the ersatz scoop, they go on with their lives. They live to fight Trumpism another day. Did Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier of BuzzFeed suffer for falsely reporting that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress? Nope. Their position is merely that maybe the story will turn out to be true someday. They haven\u2019t even retracted the story, much less tendered their resignations, much less placed themselves in the stocks of the town square so that passersby can fire tomatoes at them. (BuzzFeed appended a weaselly note to the original story feebly expressing hope that more information would emerge that would back up their story. That ain\u2019t how it works. You get it right first, then publish.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitico reporters Natasha Bertrand and Bryan Bender suspect President Trump has been directing Air Force flights to an obscure Scottish airport and fuel stop in order to generate business for his nearby hotel. Since the Obama-era Air Force also used the fuel point (which Trump has no interest in) scores of times, and since those troops also understandably stayed at the hotel because it\u2019s affordable and close to the airport, there is only a scandal here if Trump, or someone operating at Trump\u2019s direction, is ordering the Air Force to do things differently than it ordinarily would in order to benefit Trump. The numbers at issue here are paltry. The hotel is charging $130 a night. How much of that winds up in Trump\u2019s pocket, 11 cents? Bender and Bertrand inform us in dire tones that Air Force crews have made \u201cat least four stays\u201d at the Trump resort in the last year. How much do four stays at a cheap hotel really mean to a billionaire?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Politico or any other outlet whips up a fake scandal, the predictable next stage is that even more specious and disgusting things get said by pundits joining the pile-on. Rachel Maddow, in her gonzo throw-everything-at-the-wall way, falsely claimed the other night that the fuel stop was charging more for fuel, as though that were a scandal. It turns out the fuel stop is charging ordinary rates, and Trump doesn\u2019t own it anyway. John Hirschauer calls B.S. on her. Maddow slandered the military in an absolutely vile manner when she declared the \u201cU.S. military is in on it now,\u201d meaning corruption. Bertrand called Maddow\u2019s take on the matter \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how this story ought to be reported. If Trump ordered the Air Force to prop up his failing resort, there must be a long chain of intermediaries who took this directive from the president and passed it down the line. Find one of those flunkies and get him to spill the beans. Did Bender and Bertrand do so? No. Do they even exist? Until Bertrand and Bender find them and get them to talk, the story isn\u2019t there. Yet Bertrand blathers on this morning with this tweet: \u201cBREAKING: Preliminary results of the Air Force\u2019s review of its use of Trump Turnberry shows that the service has lodged crews at the resort up to 40 times since 2015, a figure far higher than previously known.\u201d Oh, since 2015, eh? Who was president then? The only numbers that might matter are the ones since January 20, 2017, and she doesn\u2019t even have those yet. You might as well run a headline saying, \u201cHate crimes surged in Trump Era, or Obama Era, Maybe Both, Whatever, We\u2019re Not Sure.\u201d\n\nBertrand and Bryan\u2019s own story undercuts the scandal suggested by her tweet: \u201cThe figure does not indicate how many of the stays have occurred since Trump became president. But the Air Force has significantly ramped up its overnight stops in Scotland under Trump after signing a contract with the Prestwick Airport \u2014 situated 20-plus miles from Turnberry \u2014 in the waning months of the Obama administration.\u201d The Obama-era Air Force made deals with the airport near Turnberry and this somehow earns Trump a flag for violating the emoluments clause? True, there are more Air Force flights refueling at the little airport these days, but there are perfectly plausible reasons for that: Unlike Shannon Airport in Ireland, it\u2019s got relatively good weather and is a low-traffic spot. Easy in, easy out. This argument apparently made sense to Team Obama, since they\u2019re the ones who signed the deal to use the airport more. But this does not obviously have anything to do with Trump. Hey, take it from the man himself! \u201cNOTHING TO DO WITH ME,\u201d the president tweeted on Monday. So far, this looks like the truth. Miracles can happen!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most hilarious and self-defeating detail in this morning\u2019s BREAKING news from Politico is this: \u201cSince 2015, the [Air Force] has lodged crews in the area 659 times, meaning up to 6 percent of those stays were at Turnberry.\u201d Wow, 6 whole percent? I can only imagine what the president\u2019s directive on this matter might have been. \u201cGet Mark Esper in here now, dammit! Esper, my Scottish resort is in trouble. Take a break from saving the world and save Trump Turnberry! I want you to make sure up to 6 percent of your Air Force guys making those fuel stops in Scotland are staying at my hotel. Make it happen or you\u2019ll be playing shuffleboard with Mattis!\u201d", "description": "The Air Force's lodging of crews at a Trump hotel in Scotland is a routine practice begun under Obama, and it adds up to nothing approaching a scandal.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
