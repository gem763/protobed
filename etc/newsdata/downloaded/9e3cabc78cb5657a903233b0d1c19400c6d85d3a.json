The United States is a net exporter producing 16 million barrels of oil a day and much of that has been because of the deregulatory agenda of this administration that has enabled so much of that.\"\n\nThe U.S. is stronger than ever thanks to fracking, he added.\n\n\u201cYou look at today all the Democratic candidates on the stage are basically advocating abolishing of fracking -- fracking is what's enabled America to become far more insulated from these sorts of events enabling us to be a bit better prepared,\u201d said Short.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Bartiromo asked whether the president is abandoning his pressure against Iran amid John Bolton\u2019s departure, Short replied: \u201cThere's no talk of abandoning the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact the reality is that ... we've united international communities to put these sanctions on Iran and it is causing Iran to suffer. We want the Iranian people to experience freedom\u2026 And we know that they're basically putting this pressure on Iran is helping that cause. But the reality is that they are\u2026 struggling enormously because their oil exports have diminished dramatically down to a small fraction of what it was. And so they want to have oil price shocks,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Energy independence protects the U.S. from the Saudi oil attack, said Marc Short to FOX Business.", "authors": ["Julia Limitone"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Marc-4.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
