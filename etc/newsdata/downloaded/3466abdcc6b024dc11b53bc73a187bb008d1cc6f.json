Others may wing it.\n\nWhen Adam Cmejla launched his firm in 2011, he took a reactive approach to setting his fees. They lacked consistency and wavered by the day.\n\n\u201cI based my fee on what someone could afford to pay,\u201d said Cmejla, a certified financial planner in Carmel, Ind. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a standard fee schedule. I didn\u2019t have a sustainable, repeatable plan to grow the practice and I hadn\u2019t figured out yet that my fee needed to be in relationship to the value I delivered and the financial metrics I needed to sustain and grow my business.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, his firm grew. But that wasn\u2019t necessarily good news.\n\n\u201cI had to work more and more just to maintain my business,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I realized the problem until the volume brought it to the surface.\u201d\n\nBy 2017, Cmejla was struggling to find the time to devote to newcomers paying him $7,000 or more a year for comprehensive financial planning because he was near capacity servicing legacy clients paying as little as $600 a year. Conferring with his business coach, Cmejla knew he needed to rethink his strategy.\n\nOver the next year, he began raising fees across-the-board. With an average fee increase of 100% \u2014 and in some instances as much as 400% \u2014 Cmejla knew that the process would prove rocky. For certain clients, he engineered what he calls \u201ca mutual parting\u201d where he urged them to move on and secure a lower-cost option to fit their modest needs. He views these cases as win-win outcomes, because he saved them money while reconfiguring his book of business to better fit his strategic growth objectives.\n\n\u201cMaybe they were paying me $800 a year and they were in a stable period in their life where they didn\u2019t need as much planning,\u201d he said.\n\nCmejla informed clients of the new fees during his regularly scheduled review meetings that took place in 2018. At first, he felt nervous broaching the subject.\n\n\u201cYou have to have the courage in that first conversation you have with clients,\u201d he said. \u201cBy having that first conversation and second and third conversation, you gain confidence.\u201d\n\nHis coach correctly predicted that most clients would stick with him despite the higher fees. Out of more than 50 households, only two balked at the fee increase and parted ways.\n\nCmejla concludes that many clients accepted the new pricing partly because of the \u201crelationship equity\u201d he had built with them and partly due to the hassle of shopping for a new planner.\n\n\u201cChanging advisers is a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already done all the heavy lifting,\u201d he adds, so clients may decide to stick with the person they know and like who has developed their financial plan and helped them implement it.\n\nFor advisers weighing whether to raise their fees, Cmejla offers a few pointers. First, beware of breaking the news in a letter to clients. You risk alienating people if you inform them en masse that you will raise your price by a certain date unless you hear from them.\n\nIt\u2019s better to deliver the news face-to-face \u2014 and to lay the groundwork with care. In the printed agenda that Cmejla sent to clients before their review meeting, he included \u201cFinancial planning fee discussion\u201d to give them a heads-up.\n\nFinally, provide context when explaining your rationale for the fee increase. Present it as an outgrowth of changes in your business.\n\n\u201cAs you know, we\u2019ve always engaged in comprehensive financial planning,\u201d Cmejla told clients. \u201cYour fee has ranged from X to Y over the years. I\u2019ve had to make some tough decisions in terms of the sustainability of my practice. Part of that is raising fees. In your case, it\u2019s now going to be Z. I know this is a big increase.\u201d\n\nThe transition went well for Cmejla. He now works with about 105 households and oversees roughly $45 million in assets. He reports revenue growth of almost 80% over the past year as his new pricing took effect, with a significant portion of that revenue jump due to the fee increase.\n\nCheck out these retirement and savings features from MarketWatch:", "description": "Advisers need to have clear communication and a solid rationale for a fee hike, writes Morey Stettner.", "authors": ["Morey Stettner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR734_advise_ZG_20181014165634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
