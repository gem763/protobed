I disagree profoundly with what they had to say,\u201d he said, before pressing ahead with a planned speech on the business links between the UK and the US.\n\nBut a No 10 source criticised the 11 supreme court judges, saying they had made \u201ca serious mistake in extending its reach to these political matters.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who travelled to Balmoral to formalise the decision to suspend parliament with the Queen, reportedly told colleagues on a cabinet conference call that the supreme court judgment was a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d.\n\nOpposition MPs are determined to force Johnson to face questions in parliament, after the Speaker, John Bercow, announced from College Green in Westminster that the House of Commons would reconvene on Wednesday morning.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was consulting with fellow opposition leaders on Tuesday evening about how to exert maximum pressure on the prime minister and ensure he cannot escape the legal obligation set out in the Benn bill to delay Brexit if he hasn\u2019t passed a deal by 19 October.\n\nThe Labour leader, who on Tuesday delivered his conference speech 24 hours early after the decision to recall parliament, was not expected to take the nuclear option of tabling a vote of no confidence in the prime minister immediately, but MPs were exploring ways of forcing Johnson to extend article 50.\n\nCorbyn would be unlikely to secure the support of Liberal Democrat or rebel Tory MPs in a no-confidence vote, unless a no-deal Brexit has been definitively ruled out \u2013 which many MPs believe means after Johnson has requested a Brexit delay.\n\nHowever, Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he has no intention of asking for an extension if he has failed to secure a majority for a Brexit deal by 19 October.\n\nJohnson, who has lost a series of Commons votes since becoming prime minister, is due to arrive in London around lunchtime on Wednesday after an overnight flight back from the UN general assembly.\n\nHowever, a government official in New York with the prime minister said it was impossible to say whether Johnson would appear before the Commons.\n\n\u201cI would anticipate there would be statements to the house, I\u2019m just not in a position to say what they will be on,\u201d the official said.\n\nQuick guide The six key paragraphs in the supreme court's verdict Show Hide That the court judgment was not about Brexit \u201cIt is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d That the court had the right to act \u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019 \u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the vonstitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful \u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c That parliament has not been prorogued \u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d What happens next? \u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d The full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.\n\nDowning Street suggested the prime minister would continue to push for a snap general election, while opposition parties attempted to inflict maximum embarrassment on Johnson.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days parliament is likely to be put on the spot to see if it will have an election or whether it will continue to keep the country in zombie-parliament stasis. The only way out is an election and they will be given another opportunity to let the public decide if and when we leave the EU,\u201d said a No 10 source.\n\nLabour has twice voted against motions tabled by the prime minister calling for a snap poll, and Downing Street has sought to portray Corbyn as part of a Westminster elite trying to block Brexit.\n\nCorbyn threw that language back at Johnson in his conference speech on Tuesday, claiming the prime minister is \u201cpart of an elite that disdains democracy\u201d.\n\nAt Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, MPs and party strategists crowded around television screens to watch Lady Hale deliver the court\u2019s unanimous verdict.\n\nPlay Video Supreme court rules prorogation 'unlawful, void and of no effect' \u2013 video\n\nThere were audible intakes of breath when she said Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament was, \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d. Corbyn made a speech from the conference stage almost immediately, calling on the prime minister to resign.\n\nHe then brought forward his party conference speech to Tuesday afternoon, using it to issue a rallying cry to activists and prepare the ground for a general election.\n\nThe prime minister flatly rejected the idea that he could resign over the defeat, and was backed up by Donald Trump, when the pair held a joint press briefing in New York. Asked if he might step down, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I know him well, he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d Johnson added: \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d\n\nDid Johnson lie to the Queen? Key questions in supreme court verdict Read more\n\nTrump went on to say the reporter concerned had asked \u201ca very nasty question\u201d.\n\nThe shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox should also appear in the Commons to face questions from MPs.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister needs to consider his position. He needs to come to parliament straight away and make a statement so we can question him.\n\nHe added: \u201cGeoffrey Cox also needs to think about his position, and come and make a statement so that he can be questioned about his legal advice.\u201d\n\nAmid the confusion, Downing Street moved to try and shore up the position of Cox, whose legal advice saying prorogation was lawful was leaked.\n\n\u201cGeoffrey Cox is doing an excellent job and is no way, shape or form to blame for anything that happened,\u201d a No 10 source said.\n\nPlay Video 1:15 Nicola Sturgeon calls on Boris Johnson to resign - video\n\nThe Conservatives are due to hold their own annual conference in Manchester next week, with Johnson\u2019s setpiece speech scheduled to clash with prime minister\u2019s questions.\n\nThe government would have to win a vote in parliament if it wanted to call a recess to allow Tory conference to go ahead.\n\nDowning Street\u2019s response to the crisis was inconsistent, with one part of the operation claiming that Johnson was infuriated by the position in which he found himself and another senior source claiming that the clash with the courts was not unhelpful to his narrative that he was fighting for Brexit against an obstructive establishment.\n\nThere were also mixed messages from Johnson\u2019s inner circle over how far to go in attacking the supreme court judges and accusing them of becoming political, with Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, urging that they should be respected.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s official spokesman downplayed the idea that the judges had interfered in politics, but another No 10 source said: \u201cWe think the supreme court is wrong and has made a serious mistake in extending its reach to these political matters. Further, the supreme court has made it clear that its reasons are connected to the parliamentary disputes over, and timetable for, leaving the European Union. We think this is a further serious mistake.\u201d", "description": "As decision to shut parliament is quashed, humiliated PM says he disagrees", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Peter Walker", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12acd7211f6b378205e20a8e7597a2376ed31063/0_138_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=401621cbd768fc3a9fc9d6b68049d968", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
