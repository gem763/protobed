While the situation is volatile and evolving, the risks of a hard Brexit are high,\u201d it said in its pre-budget submission on Wednesday.\n\nAt Dublin Castle, the agriculture minister, Michael Creed, conceded that the all-island agri-food sector could be in serious trouble if the UK crashes out.\n\n\u201cI do accept that that\u2019s in some jeopardy now and obviously we are in negotiations with the [European] commission on what alternative arrangements can be put in place should the withdrawal agreement fall,\u201d he said.\n\nHe declined to give any detail on what these arrangements would be, an omission that is causing increasing anxiety among farmers and food producers in the border regions.\n\nWith 30% of all Northern Irish milk taken across the border for cheese and butter production and 400,000 sheep a year going south to abattoirs in the republic, farmers are deeply concerned.\n\n\u201cAll in all, no deal will be a total disaster and a percentage of farmers would be out of business,\u201d said Ivor Ferguson, president of the Ulster Farmers Union, who was also in Dublin Castle to try and buttonhole officials and ministers.\n\nThere was a palpable sense of frustration about being kept in the dark about border checks as delegates mingled over a coffee break.\n\n\u201cThey just wouldn\u2019t answer the questions. The department officials on stage said that\u2019s a political question when asked about border checks, so it needs a political answer,\u201d said Eamonn Wall, plants manager at the Arboretum horticulture centre in Leighlinbridge in County Carlow.\n\n\u201cHow can you plan around that? It\u2019s like trying to organise a wedding without knowing who the bride and groom are,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week Varadkar confirmed for the first time that there would be checks on goods coming across the Northern Ireland border. \u201cSome may need to take place near the border\u201d rather than on the border but most would be in ports, airports and at businesses.\n\nThat is of little comfort to agri-food businesses facing mandatory sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks.\n\nOne poultry business told the Guardian they have been told that \u201cnear the border\u201d is actually 100 miles away at Dublin Port, the only place with a Brexit-ready border inspection post.\n\nManor Farm in County Cavan, which slaughters 1m chickens a week, employs more than 800 people and relies on 160 farmers, faces major disruption and additional costs if this is the case, one of its executives revealed as they took stock of what little information they garnered at the Department of Agriculture seminar.\n\nNo-deal Brexit likely to push up price of bread in Ireland Read more\n\nThey import day-old chicks from across the border in Dungannon and six weeks out they still don\u2019t know if they will have to make the 200-mile trip to Dublin just to keep their business running.\n\n\u201cBrexit is taking up a lot of our time \u2013 70% to 80% of my job in March was preparing for Brexit and we\u2019re back here again and you can\u2019t fathom what is going to happen. It changes by the hour,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Reilly who works in finance.\n\nTrade to and from the UK is a vital part of Ireland\u2019s economy with \u20ac16bn (\u00a314.3bn) worth of exports to the UK in 2018 including around 50% of its beef and almost half its cheddar cheese.\n\nThe EU has already given Ireland permission to open the coffers to help businesses cushion themselves \u2013 and Irish businesses are demanding \u00a31bn to mitigate the Brexit shock.\n\nRepresentatives of the French government were also at Dublin Castle to explain the special corridor they have set up for Irish freight using the UK as a landbridge to the continent.\n\nThey have built a new smart-border customs system in Calais which will allow officials to distinguish between trucks carrying Irish and British cargo. Scans of documents will be taken while the truck is passing through the Eurotunnel or on the ferry allowing them to be waved through in Calais as an \u201cEU member state\u201d truck not requiring SPS checks.\n\nBut Padraic O\u2019Leary, the managing director of Walsh Mushrooms which exports 200 tonnes of mushrooms a week to UK supermarkets and the food industry, says Brexit has already been \u201ca disaster for the mushroom industry\u201d.\n\nWill the plastic punnets the mushrooms are placed in by the pickers incur tariffs? And what about the wooden pallets they are delivered on?\n\nUnder EU law the pallets returning from the EU and entering Ireland will have to be heat-treated or fumigated for bugs and disease. But there is a shortage in the UK and the government has not been stockpiling them, Michael Gove revealed last week.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what comes down the track in terms of paperwork, what we can\u2019t deal with is the collapse in sterling,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cNobody is making money selling to the UK. We are just surviving.\u201d", "description": "Lack of clarity causing increasing anxiety among farmers and food producers in border regions", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239347e4c44c26bddc23a3a3cca6e938518f1ccf/0_171_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a88bf542bb3d4afe968fe9aeb92fa42", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
