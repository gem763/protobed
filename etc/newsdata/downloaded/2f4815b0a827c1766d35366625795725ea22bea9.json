The caption read: 'I feel like crying'.", "description": "The clip, believed to be filmed in Germany, captures a motorist as he passes a Red Cargo lorry which had pulled over on the side of a road.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/19/20391878-0-image-a-48_1572464055275.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
