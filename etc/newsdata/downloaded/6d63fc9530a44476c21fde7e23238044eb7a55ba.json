That becomes the latest chapter in the now 2-week-old saga over Morey\u2019s tweet that was quickly deleted but has led to considerable damage to the long relationship between the NBA and China.\n\n\u201cI felt we had made enormous progress in terms of building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people,\u201d Silver said Thursday during an appearance at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York. \u201cAgain, I have regret that much of that was lost. And I\u2019m not even sure where we\u2019ll go from here.\u201d\n\nThat future seems even murkier now.\n\nDuring that same appearance, Silver revealed that the Chinese government told the NBA it wanted Morey fired.\n\n\u201cObviously, we made clear that we were being asked to fire him by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe said, \u2018There\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang rebutted by saying, \u201cthe Chinese government never posed this requirement.\u201d Geng said last week that the NBA \u201cknows better than anyone else\u201d how to go about repairing the relationship with the Chinese, though did not offer specifics.\n\nThe league and LeBron James, one of its biggest stars, have been heavily criticized by some U.S. lawmakers for the perception that they caved to the Chinese regime. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make an absolute clear statement that the values of the NBA, these American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets were of massive interest in China, largely because of Yao Ming \u2014 the Chinese star who spent his entire NBA career in Houston. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has suspended its ties to the Rockets because of the tweet.\n\nMorey has not commented publicly since a pair of tweets on Oct. 6 attempting to clarify his position.\n\n\u201cI understand there is a point of view from some that we shouldn\u2019t be in business at all in China, and I\u2019d say from an intellectual standpoint, that\u2019s fair \u2014 not getting into whether the tweet or the response to it,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut if people believe that we shouldn\u2019t be engaged in commerce in China or frankly in other places in the world \u2026 I, at some point, look to the American government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of negotiating a trade agreement,\u201d Silver continued. \u201cMany multinational corporations do trade extensively with China. And if that\u2019s ultimately how our government feels we should be dealing with China, again, we are a U.S. company.\u201d\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV did not air the two NBA preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets last week. Tencent, which has a $1.5 billion deal to stream NBA games in China over the next five years, has also stopped showing Rockets games but has not totally dropped all NBA content.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d Silver said. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China, as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d", "description": "The rift between the NBA and China appeared to widen again Friday, as the fallout over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images24-4-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
