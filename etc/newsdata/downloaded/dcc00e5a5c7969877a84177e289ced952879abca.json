The two words are damn iconic, and as anyone who watched The Simple Life knows, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean something or someone was physically / sexually attractive. It was simply Paris\u2019 way of voicing her appreciation.\n\nWhich is precisely what Paris has gone and done on human angel Millie Bobby Brown\u2018s Instagram account, after the 15-year-old Stranger Things star posted a pic of herself in a leopard print frock.\n\nShe commented: \u201cThat\u2019s hot\u201d with a heart emoji, prompting Millie\u2019s other followers to point out that such a comment is maaaaybe not 100% appropriate given her age. One such commenter was Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood \u2014 check out the exchange below:\n\nOther commenters chimed in with: \u201cShe\u2019s only 15 chill!\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s a child, stop\u201d and \u201cYou are almost 40, ma\u2019am.\u201d But others were there for Paris, with one pointing out: \u201cSome of y\u2019all haven\u2019t seen The Simple Life and it shows.\u201d\n\nAccording to People, another user even went one to explain the etymology behind the phrase \u201cthat\u2019s hot\u201d, saying: \u201cAnyone familiar with [Paris Hilton] knows that the phrase \u2018that\u2019s hot\u2019 just basically means \u2018that\u2019s cool\u2019 or to show appreciation for something you think is awesome.\u201d\n\nLook, I know in my heart that Paris was just being Paris, but can also see that people would take it the entirely wrong way. For now, the comment is still up and neither Millie nor Paris have responded.", "description": "Paris Hilton has just discovered that her trademark phrase \"That's hot\" doesn't always land -- case in point, on Millie Bobby Brown's Insta.", "authors": ["Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/mbb-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
