One reading suggests that Job\u2019s breasts symbolize ponds, where cattle can drink.\n\nA few hundred years later, during the 19th century, a time of scientific discovery and adventurous expeditions, allegorical readings of men breastfeeding gave way to more detailed accounts, albeit ones tinged with an unmistakable colonial exoticism.\n\nIn the summer of 1800, during a five-year expedition through Central and South America, the Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt passed through the small village of Arenas in what is today Venezuela. There, he was told the story of a local man who, after his wife had fallen ill, nursed his baby \u201ctwo or three times a day for five months.\u201d Humboldt got to meet the father later that year and examined his breasts, which were wrinkled, \u201clike those of a woman who has suckled.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the American physician George M. Gould and his colleague Walter L. Pyle listed, in their book \u201cAnomalies and Curiosities of Medicine,\u201d a number of instances of men suckling infants, including an unverifiable report, relayed by 16th-century missionaries in Brazil, claiming \u201cthere was a whole Indian nation whose women had small and withered breasts, and whose children owed their nourishment entirely from the males.\u201d\n\nOnly once do we get a sense of how others reacted to these events. The naturalist John Richardson, while on an expedition through northern Canada in the early 19th century, wrote of a Chipewyan father who nursed his child after his spouse died. He was viewed as \u201cpartaking of the duties of women\u201d by other Chipewyan, who saw it as \u201cdegrading.\u201d\n\nWhat Richardson thought of the matter we don\u2019t know. Nor do we have any additional sources to help determine that any of these events actually happened as recorded, or whether cultural misunderstandings or biases may have warped the accounts.\n\nIn the 1930s, the search for an answer to whether men could breastfeed moved from expeditions to the laboratory. Although Charles Darwin had observed that there were instances when men could yield \u201ca copious supply of milk,\u201d it was not until the discovery and naming of the milk-producing hormone prolactin in 1933 that scientists could really begin to examine the lactating ability of male mammals. Experiments were performed on rats, monkeys and, in some cases, humans. And they worked. In a study in 1954, three men with cancer who had been on estrogen treatment were injected with large doses of luteotrophin, a form of prolactin. One of them, age 64, lactated on the sixth day of the treatment. He didn\u2019t stop for seven years.", "description": "He has intrigued and disgusted for millenniums.
