Every time Business Insider publishes a list attempting to rank fast-food burgers, we are met with endless backlash and bickering.\n\nRead more: I tried the signature burgers from 5 major fast-food chains, and the winner was obvious\n\nSo, we decided to ask readers of our fast-food coverage which chain has the best burger in fast food, with more than 3,000 people participating.\n\nTo avoid giving larger chains an unfair advantage \u2014 1,833 had visited McDonald's in the last six months, while only 300 had visited Whataburger \u2014 we crunched the numbers to create a \"deliciousness ratio.\" The ratio was calculated by dividing the number of people who said the chain had the best burger by the number who had visited a chain in the last six months.\n\nMost burger chains' \"deliciousness ratio\" was pretty low. For example, 116 people said McDonald's had the best burger \u2014 but with 1,833 people visiting in the last six months, that puts the ratio at just 6%.\n\nOn the other hand, the dominant burger chains easily stood out from the pack.
