The US State Department told Insider it was aware of the reports of the attack and was investigating.\n\nA soldier manning a checkpoint near a restaurant was killed, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\n\nThe Green Zone is home to several Western embassies and government offices.\n\nThe attack comes as Iraq is gripped by anti-government protests. More than 240 people have been killed this month as security forces crackdown on the growing protest movement.\n\nProtests in Iraq are gaining momentum with tens of thousands of people gathering in a central square in Baghdad and across much of the country's Shiite-majority central southern provinces.\n\nSecurity and hospital officials say more than 60 protesters were injured Wednesday by tear gas canisters fired by security forces at protesters in the vicinity of Tahrir Square, which has emerged as the epicenter of the protests.\n\nThe protests are over deteriorating living conditions, unemployment and corruption. Protesters have been joined by supporters of an influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who has called on the government to resign. They are also joined by university and school students.\n\nThe protests across Iraq have been met with bullets and tear gas by security forces. A total of 240 people have been killed since the unrest began Oct. 1.\n\nSome US lawmakers have expressed concern about the escalating situation in Iraq in recent weeks, particularly as it occurs in concert with chaotic developments in Syria linked to President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw troops from the northern part of the country. The withdraw sparked bipartisan outrage in Washington, as it effectively abandoned US-allied Kurdish forces to a Turkish military operation. The Kurdish forces bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against ISIS, and Trump's Syria retreat was seen as a betrayal.\n\nThe State Department ordered a partial evacuation of the US Embassy in Baghdad in May amid heightened tensions with Iran, and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has raised alarm about the lack of a diplomatic presence in the country as the region faces a number of crises.\n\nShortly after the Syria retreat was announced by the White House earlier this month, which was followed closely by a Turkish invasion, Murphy told Insider: \"Iraq is at a political crisis right now. They have a weak central government, a US that has pulled its diplomatic presence, and protests erupting all over the country. \"\n\nMurphy, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, added: \"We now have handed Iraq a potential flood of refugees and new recruits to ISIS in Iraq. We could be spelling the doom of not just Syria, but Iraq as well.\"", "description": "Two Katyusha rockets were fired into Baghdad's Green Zone Wendnesday night, landing about 100 meters away from the US Embassy.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger", "Ellen Ioanes", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9fdaddee01964d8421444?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
