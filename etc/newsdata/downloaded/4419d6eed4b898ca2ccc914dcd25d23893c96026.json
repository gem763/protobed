Defensive sectors are so named because stocks in those categories tend to collectively outperform during periods of market turbulence. Utilities shares gained 4.1%, consumer staples 2.3% and real estate 4.6%, in August, according to FactSet.\n\nE-Trade clients, however, bucked this trend and were net sellers of real estate and consumer staples stocks, though they were net buyers of utilities.\n\nE-Trrade Financial Corp.\n\nLarkin said that these flows are evidence of individual investors looking for quality stocks on the cheap in cyclical sectors that have lagged behind the market this year. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing pronounced interest in middle-ground players like materials,\u201d he said. He pointed to Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, -1.31% as one company in the sector that clients are buying and \u201cwhich has been down significantly and could be viewed as a bargain.\u201d\n\nThe Materials Select Sector SPDR fund XLB, -0.79% has appreciated 11.1% year-to-date, versus the S&P 500\u2019s 15.7% rise.\n\nThough the information technology sector remains the second-best performing year-to-date, E-Trade clients were net sellers of these stocks in August, driven by concerns over global trade. Clients have been sellers of semiconductor stocks in particular, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -1.75%, Symantec Corp. SYMC, -1.12% and Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.66%.\n\n\u201cChip makers have been a trade war casualty,\u201d Larkin said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing traders unload some of their positions in some of the well-known players.\u201d", "description": "Defensive sectors have taken a decisive leadership role in recent weeks, but individual investors are looking to buck market trends, buying up shares of...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ593_sale_b_ZG_20190903152041.jpg"}
