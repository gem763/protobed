Since then, there\u2019s already been a slew of new updates: iOS 13.1 was released just five days later on September 24th, followed by iOS 13.1.1 on the 27th, and 13.1.2 on the 30th. It\u2019s been just over a week since 13.1.2 launched, making this the longest-lasting version of iOS 13 yet.\n\nIn my original review, I noted that iOS 13 felt buggy and unfinished, with missing features and glitchy software. Two and a half weeks \u2014 and three software updates \u2014 later, how do things look now?\n\nWell, it\u2019s definitely better. Some glitches I\u2019d seen on the original release have been fixed in the subsequent updates. App crashing problems and loss of wireless service seem to be patched, as have some visual glitches when entering text in iMessage and unfinished areas of dark mode. More importantly, Apple has used the updates to patch some critical security flaws, like a lock screen exploit that iOS 13 shipped with, as well as key functionality issues with iCloud backups.\n\nAlso new are some of the features that missed iOS 13.0, like Apple Maps\u2019 ETA sharing and automated Shortcuts, which are nice to have, but aren\u2019t exactly must-haves either. Other flashy upgrades, like HomePod music handoff, still haven\u2019t shown up.\n\nI\u2019ve also run into new bugs since iOS 13.1\n\nAnd despite the numerous updates, there are still issues that haven\u2019t gone anywhere for me: a glitch in the Apple Music app where the downloaded song list won\u2019t update, for example, a bug that I\u2019ve seen in every version of iOS 13 so far. Some apps still immediately crash when I try to tap into new notifications, even after three software updates. Even more concerning, I\u2019ve also run into new bugs since iOS 13.1, like broken notifications on my main email application, Edison Mail. Despite my best efforts, I can\u2019t seem to find any solution for that, short of temporarily switching apps.\n\nSo where does that all put you, the iOS 12 customer deciding whether to upgrade? Unfortunately, likely in the same place that the original iOS 13 release did. The current iteration of the software is unquestionably better than it was, but unless you truly need the new features on offer here (like if you\u2019re also planning to update to Catalina and don\u2019t want your Reminders app to get wrecked), it\u2019s still probably worth waiting for another update or two to iron out a few more bugs. Things just haven\u2019t changed that much since iOS 13.0, although the rapid pace of Apple\u2019s updates hopefully indicates that more fixes will be coming soon. The company has already released a beta version of 13.2 with new features for the iPhone 11, so it looks like that will be coming down the pike very soon.\n\nOn the other hand, no piece of software is ever going to be perfect. iOS 13 will almost surely be better with the next incremental update of bug fixes and patches, and there\u2019s ultimately no right answer as to which version of iOS 13 is the one that\u2019s right for you. And if you must have the latest and greatest now, iOS 13.1.2 certainly isn\u2019t worse than it was at launch. But it still has plenty of room for improvement.\n\nCorrection: AirPod audio sharing launched in iOS 13.1 \u2014 this article originally listed it as a still forthcoming feature.", "description": "Apple released iOS 13 on September 19th.
