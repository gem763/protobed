(AP) - Just when the San Francisco 49ers lose a starting cornerback, they have to face Odell Beckham Jr. and the Cleveland Browns.\n\nStarting cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon sprained his foot in the 49ers\u2019 24-20 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers and will miss at least another two weeks. His replacement, Emmanuel Moseley, is an undrafted free agent in 2018. Now, Moseley will make his starting debut against an elite wide receiver on Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe trust (Moseley),\u201d 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see him play. I know he\u2019ll be up for the challenge going against one of the better receivers in the league in Odell. It obviously will be a challenge. It will be a challenge for Richard Sherman also. It\u2019s a challenge for everyone in this league, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nMoseley isn\u2019t totally green. He played seven snaps at cornerback against the Steelers after Witherspoon left the game, and defensive coordinator Robert Saleh liked what he saw from Moseley.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great mindset to him,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of anything. That\u2019s the number one prerequisite for a corner: You can\u2019t be scared. He\u2019s also got a very short memory so, if he does get beat, he\u2019s able to line up as if nothing happened and keep grinding. There\u2019s no fear in his football game.\u201d\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, Moseley started 31 games at the University of Tennessee. In 2018, he ran a 4.42 40-yard dash at his Pro Day, but no team selected him in the draft. So, the 49ers signed him to their practice squad.\n\nThis offseason, Moseley became the 49ers first string nickel back for two weeks during training camp while starter K\u2019Waun Williams recovered from a knee scope.\n\n\u201c(Moseley) just grabbed his spot on the roster by the neck,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cWhen we put pads on, his physicality, his mindset, his football IQ, his work ethic, all of it, it just kept growing on coaches.\u201d\n\nMoseley recorded two interceptions during training camp. He said he\u2019s more confident now than last season.\n\n\u201cThis is my second year here, so you get more comfortable with the scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you learn from guys like Sherman and Witherspoon.\u201d\n\nSherman in particular has voiced his approval of Moseley.\n\n\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t back down from anybody,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the greatest barometers when watching a player - how he treats different opponents. Does he treat the main receiver the same as the seventh receiver, or does he approach them differently? Is he more reserved and conservative in his approach when facing the main guy?\n\n\u201cYou get Moseley up there, it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s going against the starter, the backup, a rookie or a vet - he\u2019s going to approach them the same way every time. He\u2019s going to be scrappy, he\u2019s going to be competitive, he\u2019s going to be close to the ball and he\u2019s going to have a chance to make a play on it. That\u2019s all you can ask for at cornerback.\u201d\n\nEven if Sherman is correct, and Moseley does all of those things Monday night, Beckham still could make incredible catches and have a prolific game. Beckham has had so many throughout his career.\n\n\u201cOdell is one of the best in the league,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cBut, we feel pretty good about the way it will all work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Just when the San Francisco 49ers lose a starting cornerback, they have to face Odell Beckham Jr. and the Cleveland Browns.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Grant Cohn"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/49ers_cornerbacks_football_54502_c0-903-2049-2097_s1770x1032.jpg?e1134a96140b5238c4fb4facc0e924c8f4b19358", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
