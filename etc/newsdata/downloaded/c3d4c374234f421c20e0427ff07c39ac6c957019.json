Mandatory Credit: Thomas J. Russo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTied at the ninth hole following a bogey, the 20-year-old, who had led most of the day, racked up six birdies on the back nine, including three in succession to close a six-under 64 round at White Sulphur Springs.\n\nNot even a bogey at the 15th could halt his march as he won the opening tournament of the new PGA season at 21-under 259.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said the emotional Niemann, who broke into tears when asked how it felt to become the first Chilean with a victory on the U.S. tour.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to go back home and celebrate with my friends.\n\n\u201cFrom the first day, I played with a lot of confidence ... My game was feeling great and mentally it was awesome, so I was just feeling like I was going to win this tournament.\u201d\n\nHe admitted he woke up thinking about the trophy and knew he had to turn his mind to the day ahead.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to think about anything else,\u201d Niemann said. \u201cMy caddie made me laugh to try to forget about it.\n\n\u201cThe last couple of holes (as the birdies piled up) I was feeling great. I was really enjoying it.\u201d\n\nHe hoped the victory would earn him a call from Internationals captain Ernie Els for a possible captain\u2019s pick for the Presidents Cup against the United States in Australia in December.\n\n\u201cBeing on the Presidents Cup, it\u2019s just a dream,\u201d Niemann said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good team this year. There\u2019s a lot of good players fighting for spots. This win definitely helps.\u201d\n\nTom Hoge, who along with Richy Werenski had chased Niemann all afternoon, wound up second at 15-under after a closing 65.\n\nWerenski (69), Brian Harman (65), Harris English (67) and Nate Lashley (69) were another shot back.\n\nPlaying for the third time in his career at Old White TPC, Niemann had begun the day with a two-stroke lead over Werenski, Lashley and Robby Shelton.\n\nHoge fired up with birdies on five of his first eight holes but three bogeys in his next seven holes ended his threat.\n\nThe win, complete with fist pumps, brought out a new side to Niemann.\n\n\u201cNormally I\u2019m not really too excited,\u201d he said. \u201cLike normally I don\u2019t do fist pumps.\n\n\u201cJust making those putts on the last three holes was unbelievable.\u201d", "description": "Joaquin Niemann got stronger as the day progressed to become the first Chilean to win on the PGA Tour, claiming a six-shot victory at the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430245213&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0S0", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
