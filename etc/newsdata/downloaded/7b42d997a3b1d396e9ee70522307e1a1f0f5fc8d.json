For two years, the tech giant had only counted video views that lasted at least three seconds, ignoring those of shorter durations and artificially pushing the average length of a view higher. Facebook said it discovered the problem only a month before going public with it.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nA group of small advertisers sued in California federal court, alleging that Facebook engaged in unfair competitive practices by providing inaccurate information. The plaintiffs later added claims that Facebook knew about the incorrect metrics long before it ultimately fixed them and that the error was larger than what Facebook told some advertisers.\n\nThe legal battle centered on how much the inflated metrics impacted advertisers\u2019 businesses and the claim that Facebook knew about the inaccuracy of the information sooner than it had admitted.\n\nFacebook argued that the impact was minimal because the company doesn\u2019t bill advertisers based on video watch time.\n\nThe plaintiffs disputed that, calling average viewing time a common indirect barometer to guide ad-buying decisions: Clients would want to spend more on the video ads that people were actually watching.\n\n\u201cVideo completion rate is still the reigning king out there from a [key performance] perspective, but watch time is absolutely one of the indicators that clients look at for business performance,\u201d said Kait Boulos, vice president of marketing for Varick, an ad agency owned by MDC Partners Inc. \u201cMarketers want to understand what percentage of people watched for the first quarter, half or even three quarters of a video.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the proposed court settlement, Facebook would acknowledge it made an error in calculating its metrics but wouldn\u2019t admit to any other allegations.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is without merit but we believe resolving this case is in the best interests of the company and advertisers,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs declined to comment.\n\nRelated Coverage Amazon Makes a Bet on Beauty With Lady Gaga Deal\n\nIf approved, Facebook\u2019s penalty will cost the company the $40 million settlement. But the case doesn\u2019t seem to have damaged the continuing growth in its advertising business. In the second quarter of 2019, Facebook generated more than $16.6 billion in ad revenue, up 28% year over year. Facebook and Alphabet Inc. -owned Google are expected to account for 60.9% of U.S. digital ad revenue in 2019, according to eMarketer.\n\n\u201cThis is a recurring theme that we keep seeing: Facebook gets called out on something, but marketers continue to use the platform,\u201d said Ms. Boulos. \u201cIt does not seem that we\u2019re close to any straw breaking the camel\u2019s back in terms of something hindering or pushing marketers away from the platforms.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at SahilPatel@wsj.com", "description": "The Menlo Park, Calif.-based tech giant may pay $40 million to settle a lawsuit over bad video metrics, but nothing in the way of a broader business cost.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-114558/social", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
