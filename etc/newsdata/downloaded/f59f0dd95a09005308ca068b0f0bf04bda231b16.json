At the same time, the State Department\u2019s inspector general was set to brief members of Congress about protections for potential witnesses. That seemed to run counter to Pompeo\u2019s warnings, which some have said were more for the protection of Trump than of career diplomats.\n\nTrump watched the press conference, as he made clear with a tweet that called Schiff a \u201clowlife.\u201d He said, in the same message, that Schiff \u201cshould only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of\u201d Pompeo. A subsequent message from the leader of the free world deemed the impeachment inquiry \u201cBULLSHIT.\u201d\n\nAt an Oval Office meeting with the president of Finland, Trump renewed his attacks on Schiff in a notably personal way, adding a note of macho bluster about the man he has at times mocked as \u201cLiddle\u201d (Schiff is actually 5 feet 11 inches tall) and \u201cpencil-neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t call him Shifty Schiff for nothing,\u201d Trump said, adding that the congressman had the temerity to criticize Pompeo. \u201cThere\u2019s an expression, \u2018He couldn\u2019t carry his blank strap.\u2019 I won\u2019t say it, because it\u2019s so terrible to say.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP) More\n\nSchiff was the only member of Congress other than Pelosi to speak at her weekly press conference. The room was so crowded with members of the media that Pelosi joked she should invite Schiff every week. Pelosi used the closely watched press conference as an opportunity to first discuss Democratic efforts on health care and tariffs. She also brought up the long-held possibility of congressional Democrats working with Trump on infrastructure.\n\nIn a Twitter message, Trump rejected the possibility of such collaboration, deeming overtures by the speaker as \u201cjust camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment.\u201d He added that \u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud!\u201d\n\nThe presence of Schiff at Pelosi\u2019s side was the latest sign that he has become the de facto leader of the impeachment inquiry, sidelining high-ranking Democratic committee chairmen, including Jerry Nadler of New York, who heads the House Judiciary Committee, and Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who chairs the House Oversight Committee. Both have been leading investigations of their own, which have now been superseded by Schiff\u2019s probe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very busy, as you can tell, this week; we\u2019re going be very busy again next week,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe are proceeding deliberately, but at the same time, we feel a real sense of urgency here that this work needs to get done, and it needs to get done in a responsible period of time.\u201d\n\nSchiff said that on Thursday former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker will testify before the Intelligence Committee in a closed hearing. The inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael K. Atkinson, who was the recipient of the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, will testify on Friday.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff charged President Trump with \u201cincitement of violence\u201d in his combative response to the whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ARkGIyMj9GynspT4vWT5xA--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c26c32a0-e53c-11e9-b97b-053dafb793a0", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
