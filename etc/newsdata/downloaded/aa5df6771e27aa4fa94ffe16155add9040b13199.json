If you\u2019re in Japan or perhaps planning a trip there, don\u2019t be caught off guard. by: Tessa Purdon | 11 Oct 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan has become a trendy bucket-list travel destination in the last few years and with the 2019 Rugby World Cup currently taking place in The Land of the Rising Sun, the country and its culture has certainly been in the spotlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk any traveler to Asia about their favourite part of the trip and it will inevitably include food \u2013 and about how exotic and incredibly different it is to what they\u2019re used to eating at home. There are the ingredients themselves that are vastly foreign and intriguing, but also the cultural norms that go with eating them.\n\n\n\nVisiting Japan this year? We\u2019ve listed a few customs in Japanese food culture that you should be aware of when you\u2019re there.\n\n1. Slurping is a sign of appreciation\n\nWhile many cultures would see this as rude, slurping food and making a sound when doing it signals that you\u2019re enjoying the meal. From a sensory standpoint, it\u2019s also said to enhance the dish\u2019s flavours.\n\n\n\n2. Don\u2019t leave chopsticks standing vertically in a bowl\n\nWhile this is often an innocent habit, it is in fact a symbolic gesture at Japanese funerals \u2013 a bowl of rice is left with two chopsticks standing vertically in the center.\n\n\n\n3. Doggie bags don\u2019t exist\n\nToo full to finish your meal and want to take the rest home with you? The answer will generally be no, as doggie bags aren\u2019t offered in Japan. So eat it or leave it.\n\n\n\n4. Taking your shoes off isn\u2019t seen as rude or strange\n\n\n\nThe restaurants with tatami flooring (a type of mat), require guests to remove their shoes and wear special slippers that the establishment provides.\n\n\n\n5. Tipping in Japan is considered rude\n\nThe Japanese take offence when being given a tip, as it insinuates that the person being tipped doesn\u2019t earn enough or that the business/restaurant is going through hard times.\n\nALSO READ: Why is rooibos tea suddenly big in Japan?\n\nImages via Unsplash\n\nSources:\n\nNomiya Restaurant\n\n\n\nFluentU\n\n\n\nReal Estate Tokyo\n\n\n\nTripsavvy.com\n\nRead more on: features | travel | asian | cuisine", "description": "Asia is on every foodie\u2019s radar right now.
