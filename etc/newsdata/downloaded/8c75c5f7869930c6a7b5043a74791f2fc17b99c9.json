He first thought the city needed an anthem during the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d five years ago, but couldn\u2019t come up with anything that worked.\n\n\u201cThe protest songs that Hong Kongers used to sing were not truly reflecting what we are facing or how we feel, and they couldn\u2019t boost our morale as they were too pop-like,\u201d he told the Observer an in an online interview. \u201cI tried to write something then, but failed to come up with a melody that was good enough. Then I put it to the back of my mind until June this year.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pro-democracy protesters clash with authorities in the streets of Hong Kong, in images from the video.

In the early days many marched to the hymn Sing Hallelujah to the Lord, but its Christian message meant it didn\u2019t appeal to everyone; others favoured Do You Hear the People Sing from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables, but it had no particular link to Hong Kong. So Thomas marched, and thought, and listened to other anthems, official and unofficial \u2013 he was particularly inspired by the US civil war song The Battle Hymn of the Republic \u2013 but also music as varied as baroque choral compositions and Japanese pop.\n\n\u201cTheir music is often a mixture of desperation and hope,\u201d he said, of the \u2018J-pop\u2019 songs, a combination that matches sentiment in Hong Kong. Protesters know they face daunting odds, up against the might of the Chinese state, but are determined to continue anyway. It took several months before Thomas managed to write something he thought worked. \u201cI planned for an anthem, something solemn, that truly reflects our emotions and situation, something that can unite us all,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot create emotions without actual experience. I was with the crowd protesting through those months, and turning those memories and emotions into melody.\u201d\n\nHe released the first version in late August, in an online forum used by protestors to coordinate; copyright is free for all non-commercial use. By mid-September, it seemed to be everywhere, both online and in the streets. Just one single version \u2013 with choir and orchestra in the protective outfits of \u201cfrontline\u201d protesters, who have been battling riot police in the streets \u2013 has been seen over two million times on YouTube.\n\nThere are dozens of others, ranging from live footage of a spontaneous singalong to an acapella take, and ones with English-language lyrics.\n\nDespite that popularity, he was surprised when people started talking of it as a national anthem \u2013 \u201cThe movement that started in June was nothing related to independence,\u201d he said \u2013 but proud that it had achieved his original aim of unifying and inspiring the protesters.\n\n\u201cMusic solidifies our beliefs, boosts our morale even in bad conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a musician, I may offer something more powerful, that helps people to become mentally strong. Helmets may protect them from a baton once or twice, but ideas are bulletproof.\u201d", "description": "City needed a protest song to unite it, says the anonymous writer behind the tune sweeping the barricades", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20419f54d615e0a4cfbb9da42c63fb80765c124c/215_0_833_500/master/833.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=01a4de5dadaac00b23fbd1b136b8e29d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
