She dropped out of the race at the end of August.\n\nBut overall, New Hampshire is feeling neglected.\n\n\u201cEven though there are dozens and dozens of candidate visits, they\u2019re not as visible as they used to be,\u201d said Andrew Cline, the president of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy.\n\nIn an interview with The Hill, Cline, who follows New Hampshire politics closely, said the sense the state is being overlooked by candidates is widely shared.\n\n\u201cIt definitely feels like there isn\u2019t much going on in New Hampshire week to week,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Hampshire people can sound a bit miffed about the whole thing.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s annoying,\u201d Cline said about the feeling of an overshadowed first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nThe sentiment has been felt in the state throughout the summer.\n\nFor example, the famed Amherst, N.H., Fourth of July parade usually serves as a hotbed for presidential hopefuls, but none of the top-tier candidates showed up this year.\n\nMost of the top-tier no-shows had supporters marching in their absence but were met with lukewarm enthusiasm compared to the low-polling candidates, such as Delaney and Rep.

Instead, she campaigned in Nevada and Texas.\n\nSanders, the other next-door candidate, campaigned in Iowa that weekend and did not make a single trip to New Hampshire during the month of July.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two dozen Democratic candidates averaged 23.9 campaign stops in the first seven months of the year, compared to the 14.5 visits by the smaller 2016 Democratic field.\n\nDemocratic candidates have also generally spent the same number of days spent in the state, averaging a little more than nine days in the first half of 2019 and seven days in 2015.\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire Survey Center Director Andrew Smith attributed top-tier candidates\u2019 lack of a presence in New Hampshire to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s debate requirement structure that requires candidates to run more of a national campaign.\n\n\u201cYou do have to spend more time in other parts of the country to get the media attention in order [for] your next poll numbers to go up,\u201d Smith told The Hill. Candidates also need to raise money and Smith noted, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to find it in Iowa and New Hampshire.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuys like [John] Delaney have been here forever,\u201d said Smith. \u201c[There are] always candidates in the state if you want to go see them but I think \u2026 the top candidates are spreading themselves out a little bit more.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign has privately acknowledged her lack of a presence.\n\nHarris\u2019s team accidentally left behind an internal memo at a New Hampshire restaurant, obtained by Politico in early September, acknowledging her \u201csummer slump\u201d in the state.\n\nThe memo listed talking points to respond to criticisms from N.H. voters about her lack of appearances. The talking points included, \u201cNH absolutely a priority for my campaign \u2014 excited to be back for the [2019 NH Democratic Party State Convention] and other events around the state\u201d and noting recent polling.", "description": "BEDFORD, N.H. \u2014 New Hampshire is feeling underappreciated in the 2020 presidential cycle, partly because many of the biggest names are coming to the Granite State less frequently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/newhampshire2020_092019hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
