I am overwhelmed with gratitude and feel very blessed to receive such an amazing gift.\u2019\n\nBohdan Pomahac, Director of Plastic Surgery Transplantation at Brigham Health, said Robert is now \u2018progressing and recovering remarkably fast\u2019.\n\nDying veteran's final wish to see his puppy is granted in emotional reunion\n\nHe continued: \u2018We are looking forward to seeing a significant improvement in Robert\u2019s quality of life.\n\n\u2018Our previous experience has demonstrated that face transplantation is a viable option for patients with severe disfigurement and limited function who have no alternatives.\n\n\u2018As we continue to expand this treatment to more patients, we are exploring the ways in which we can quantify how much benefit our patients receive as well as identifying opportunities to limit the risks of this transplant through new immunosuppression protocols.\u2019\n\nRobert said he is \u2018overwhelmed with gratitude\u2019 after receiving the transplant (Picture: Lightchaser Photography/Caters)\n\nAlexandra Glazier, President and CEO of New England Donor Services, emphasised that it is \u2018vitally important for individuals of all races and ethnicities\u2019 to consider organ donation, including skin grafts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018Unlike internal organs, the skin tone of the donor may be important to finding a match.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
