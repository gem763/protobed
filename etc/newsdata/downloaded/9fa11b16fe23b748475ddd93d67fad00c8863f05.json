Darrell Issa is expected to announce Thursday that he will launch a primary challenge to embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who was indicted last year for alleged misuse of campaign funds.\n\nHunter won reelection in his deeply Republican district in San Diego last year less than three months after he and his wife were indicted for allegedly using $250,000 in campaign funds for private expenses.

He is not in the district, nothing close to it. He probably doesn\u2019t know much about the district. But it\u2019s anybody\u2019s prerogative to run for office anywhere they want to.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHunter\u2019s trial is scheduled for January, two months before California\u2019s Republican primary.\n\nHis wife pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of conspiracy.", "description": "Former GOP Rep.
