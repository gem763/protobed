Biden, Sanders and at least three other candidates are scheduled on Monday to attend the Galivants Ferry Stump meeting in South Carolina, a state party tradition dating back to 1876.\n\nThe next weekend, 18 candidates will attend the Polk County, Iowa, steak fry, a regular stop for presidential contenders, and at least 10 candidates will participate in a forum on LGBTQ issues.\n\nAfter that, Democrats plan up to nine more debates, beginning next month in Ohio.\n\nAt least one more candidate, billionaire activist Tom Steyer, has met the heightened qualifications for the next debate, meaning it is likely to be spread over two nights as the first two were in June and July.\n\nCandidates who do not qualify for that debate, and those on stage on Thursday who are struggling in the polls, will have to decide whether they have a reason to keep running. Aside from Biden, Sanders and Warren, none of the other 17 Democratic contenders is regularly hitting double digits in support in opinion polls.\n\nCASTRO ON THE OFFENSIVE\n\nThat includes former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro, who led the charge on Thursday against Biden. He accused Biden of flip-flopping in his description of his own healthcare proposal.\n\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" Castro, 44, asked Biden, 76, who has faced questions about his age.\n\nLater, he accused Biden of being quick to tie himself to former President Barack Obama when it suited him and walk away when it did not. Biden was vice president under Obama for eight years.\n\n\"He wants to take credit for Obama's work but not have to answer any questions,\" said Castro, who served in Obama's administration.\n\n\"I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not,\" Castro told Biden. \"That'll be a surprise to him,\" Biden responded.\n\nOther candidates avoided the attacks that marked the first two rounds of the debates. Those exchanges had dismayed some Democrats, who urged the candidates to focus on laying out their own affirmative agendas.\n\nThe White House hopefuls this time tried to emphasize their areas of agreement. Biden praised former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke for his work after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, drawing a sustained ovation from the debate crowd.\n\nO'Rourke, who has called for gun licensing and a mandatory gun buyback for assault weapons, was asked if he was going to take away people's guns.\n\n\"I am if it was a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield,\" he said. \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\"", "description": "Democrats back on campaign trail after third presidential debate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8C0RX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
