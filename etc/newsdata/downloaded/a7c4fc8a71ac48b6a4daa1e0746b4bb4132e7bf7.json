It should no longer sit. This parliament is a disgrace,\u201d he said, \u201cSince I am asked, they could vote no confidence at any time. But they are too cowardly to give it a go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis parliament should have the courage to face the electorate. But it won\u2019t. It won\u2019t, because so many of them are really all about preventing us leaving the European Union. But the time is coming when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding this morning to an urgent question from Scottish National Party\u2019s MP Joanna Cherry, Cox said his advice to the government had been sound at the time. \u201cAt all times the government acted in good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional,\u201d he said.\n\nParliament resumed business today after judges at the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the queen to suspend parliament for five weeks was \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\n\"The time is coming when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas\" \u2014 U.K. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox\n\nCox rebuffed calls for him to step down, saying: \u201cIf every time I lost a case I was called upon to resign, I would probably have never had a practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are complex matters on which senior and distinguished lawyers will disagree,\u201d he added.\n\nCox added he would consider in the coming days whether the government should disclose more information about the advice he gave in this case.\n\nFormer Tory MP Oliver Letwin, who now sits as an independent, challenged Cox to guarantee that the government would not suspend parliament again \u2014 apart from perhaps a few days in the run-up to a queen\u2019s speech.\n\nCox avoided a straight answer, only saying \u201cthere will be no prorogation that doesn't comply with the terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court.\u201d", "description": "Geoffrey Cox defends his advice that suspending parliament was legal, saying the government acted \u2018in good faith.\u2019", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Annabelle Dickson", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165810346-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
