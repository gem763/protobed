It\u2019s the same thing as Subtle Bogan Traits except instead of joking about VB, we take the piss out of slapping sacks of rice at Coles. It\u2019s tailored shit-posting and I love it but as the group grew, the content changed. People started to share stories from their childhoods, of trying to talk to their parents about their mental health struggles and getting completely shut down. Some, if not all, of these posts copped thousands of reactions and comments. Suddenly, people were bonding over what it felt like, and what it feels like to have a family who doesn\u2019t believe in depression, anxiety, anorexia, the list goes on.\n\nAnd with the stories, came the (sort of) jokes.\n\nAsian parents will notice you gaining two pounds and call you fat but won\u2019t notice your depression \u2014 \u303d\ufe0f (@miggsace) October 11, 2019\n\nThough a lot of the comments and reactions on Facebook were literally \u201cHaha\u201d, a bunch of people offered support. Some utterly self-deprecating, others helpful. And it made me think of the hundreds of other young people across Australia who might be going through the same thing alone.\n\nIn a survey, Kids Helpline asked young people what they wished their parents knew about them and about things generally. 65 per cent of young people said they wanted their parents to know more about mental health and over 75 per cent said they feel like they can\u2019t talk to their parents about it. 72 per cent said their parents just don\u2019t understand mental health.\n\n\u201cParents don\u2019t have to have all the answers, and it\u2019s okay to not know,\u201d Kids Helpline Specialist Amanda Grehan told PEDESTRIAN.TV. \u201cAnd often what young people have actually told us is that they don\u2019t expect their parents to know everything, have the answers, or know what to do. They actually just want them to be calm and listen and be curious.\u201d\n\nTalking to your parents about your mental health is important, Amanda added. But it can also be very difficult.\n\n\u201cStart by giving a heads up that you need to talk about something serious. Be upfront about any concerns or fears you have in confiding in them. For example, \u2018To be honest, I\u2019m worried that if I tell you about it you might get angry and yell but I really want your help.\u2019\n\n\u201cTell them how you would like the conversation to go and tell them what you need from them, like their support.\n\n\u201cMake sure your parents have an accurate understanding of the situation. A great way to do this is to make some time and space in the conversation for questions. And build space for them to process.\u201d\n\nBuilding space can prevent parents from responding emotionally, Amanda said.\n\n\u201cFor example, you can say, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to my room and do some homework. Maybe we can talk about it some more after dinner?'\u201d\n\nAnd if parents react negatively, because there is a chance that may happen, give them time and space. Most importantly, look after yourself and reach out to other support networks like your friends, a GP, or services like Kids Helpline if you need to.\n\nEarlier this year, Kids Helpline released a flowchart for people unsure of whether or not to speak up if they\u2019re worried about a mate.\n\n\u201cSometimes when people have a mental health issue, they may not be thinking clearly or making good decisions around their safety,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cIn those cases, we all have a responsibility to get them help. If you are worried a friend might be unsafe, it\u2019s important to tell a trusted adult or Kids Helpline \u2013 even if they asked you to keep it secret.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE This New Doco Has A Bunch Of Famous Comedians Getting Real About Mental Health\n\nHeadspace National Clinical Advisor Nick Duigan recommended preparing a plan so you\u2019re set on what you want to say and how you\u2019re going to say it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s commonly most effective to approach these conversations when people are feeling calm and not rushed or stressed, and it\u2019s in a private place where they\u2019re not likely to feel interrupted.\n\n\u201cAnd if a young person is feeling uncertain about how it might go, they can ask a friend or another family member to join them in the conversation.\u201d\n\nIn his experience, parents are genuinely doing the best that they can, but sometimes a conversation about mental health comes down to a difference in opinion. And that can cause different responses.\n\n\u201cReactions from parents that would be received as hurtful or dismissive often come from a place of fear, misunderstanding, sadness, guilt, confusion, or frustration,\u201d Nick said. So try brainstorming a couple of unhelpful responses that might come up during the conversation.\n\n\u201cMake a plan about how to respond to those and as challenging as this is, try to model a calm and measured response.\n\n\u201cIf you are able to demonstrate this sense of calmness, understanding, and compassion in the moment and then take a break and revisit it later, it might just be the example that a parent needs to be a leader in a relationship.\n\n\u201cIt shows how you can be caring and compassionate in times of difficulty, which is exactly what we\u2019re all asking for in return.\u201d\n\nFormer AFL player Lance Picioane established non-profit organisation Love Me Love You in 2013 to challenge the stigma surrounding mental health in young people, and to help parents open up the conversation.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for parents is normalising the conversation,\u201d Lance said and you can do that through research and open discussion.\n\nIt\u2019s why Love Me Love You offer a slew of practical programs, like the Empowering Parents Program, to teach adults about mental health \u2013 from appropriate language to reaching out to the right mental health professionals.\n\n\u201cIt sets the tone early, it gives parents an environment to be able to bring up things they normally wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Lance continued. \u201cSome of them will raise a point or ask a question that 90 per cent of the room has wanted to ask but haven\u2019t had the opportunity to do.\u201d\n\nBut Lance knows not all parents can be as understanding.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we\u2019re still in an age where elders \u2013 our parents \u2013 still have the beliefs of 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cSo sometimes you may get a not so positive response but it\u2019s not so much a not so positive response, it might just be a lack of understanding,\u201d Lance said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the lack of understanding that is creating a bigger issue because people still don\u2019t understand the reality.\n\n\u201cThere are still people who think mental illness is a load of crap. But there\u2019s stats, research, and awareness \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be talking about this if it wasn\u2019t real.\u201d\n\nKids Helpline is here for young people aged 5-25 \u2013 anytime, any reason.
