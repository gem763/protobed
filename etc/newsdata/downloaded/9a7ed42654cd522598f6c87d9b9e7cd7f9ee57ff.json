During that conversation in late July, Trump sought Zelensky\u2019s help in getting dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cMy view is that, given the latest revelation, which is such a blatant effort to use his presidential position to advance his personal and political interests, there should be an impeachment inquiry opened,\u201d Clinton told Pauley in the interview, which took place on Tuesday just hours before Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House was launching formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe upcoming interview included Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, and was tied to publication of their new book, \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women,\u201d which profiles more than 100 trailblazing women \u2014 from the abolitionist Harriet Tubman to Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist.\n\nSince his 2016 victory, Trump has continued to attack Clinton, including over her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Clinton pushed back in the CBS interview, comparing her experience to what Biden is facing now.\n\n\u201cThe most outrageously false things were said about me,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, enough people believed them. So this is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Biden.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re for the [Democrats] or you\u2019re a Republican, when the president of the United States, who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, uses his position to in effect extort a foreign government for his political purposes, I think that is very much what the founders worried about in high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/b8/d77eb7594489bce566951abca7f8/190926-hillary-clinton-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
