I think we see 180+,\u201d he noted.\n\n$eth looks good to me. bullish s/r flip on the 30M. rejection of lows on the 4H.

As such, I am expecting some consolidation here followed by another leg up to test $230,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlthough Ethereum on its own may soon incur some bullishness, it is highly probable that its near-term price action will remain strongly correlated to that of Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Analysts are expressing mixed sentiments when it comes to Ethereum (ETH), but are generally offering a sentiment that can be defined a tempered bullishness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_1030451626-6-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
