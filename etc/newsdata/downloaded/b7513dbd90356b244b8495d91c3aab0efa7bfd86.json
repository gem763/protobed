Despite the judge's attempts to persuade her otherwise, Zhang fired her public counsel, choosing to represent herself.\n\nShe often appeared uncomfortable speaking in English, and was also accused of pretending not to understand proceedings.\n\nImage copyright Broward County Sheriff's Office Image caption Yujing Zhang\n\nOn Monday, Zhang arrived in court in her jail uniform instead of civilian clothes, complaining she had not been provided with undergarments. Judge Altman allowed her to change before the trial began.\n\nWhat happened at Mar-a-Lago?\n\nZhang was arrested on 30 March at the president's club carrying two Chinese passports, a computer and four mobile phones, among other devices, agents said. Claims one of the devices was loaded with malware were later rescinded.\n\nZhang told security at Mar-a-Lago that she was there to go to the pool, but later told a receptionist she was there for a United Nations event that prosecutors said she knew had been cancelled, according to court documents.\n\n\"Due to a potential language barrier issue,\" staff believed she was related to a club member and let her in, the documents said. But a receptionist who knew the event was off flagged her to agents.\n\nSecret Service agents questioned Zhang after she was apprehended in the resort's lobby. No swimming apparel was found on her person, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors used text messages between Zhang and the event organiser to prove she knew the charity gala had been cancelled before she left China.\n\n\"She lied to everybody to get on that property,\" Assistant US Attorney Roland Garcia told jurors.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mar-a-Lago is a private members club as well as the Trump family's winter getaway.\n\nDespite the guilty verdict the trial did not establish why exactly she was there. She told agents after her arrest a friend in China had encouraged her to speak to a member of Trump's family about Chinese-US economic relations.\n\nMr Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago that weekend but elsewhere at the time of the incident.\n\nThere has been little comment on Zhang's case in China. Hours before Zhang was found guilty, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said suggestions of connections between Zhang and the Chinese government were \"laughable\".\n\n\"The US has had too much suspicion lately,\" Ms Hua told a news conference, \"Some Americans could become sci-fi writers now.\"", "description": "The woman was accused of lying to a federal officer to illegally enter the president's resort club.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11797/production/_108757517_tv056436323.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
