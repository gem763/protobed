There\u2019s Juan Williams. There\u2019s Donna Brazile. There\u2019s Jessica Tarlov. There\u2019s Andrew Napolitano. There\u2019s the widely reported sniping of Tucker Carlson versus Shepard Smith \u2014 over Napolitano\u2019s claims of a possible impeachment smoking gun, no less.\n\nOn the one hand, that makes for good news discussion. How boring it is to listen in on chats among the choir, where everyone simply nods in agreement.\n\nOn the other hand: Fox News viewers really don\u2019t like seeing Brazile\u2019s face. That\u2019s what CNN is for, they say.\n\nThis is what Limbaugh said, in context of discussing Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s Pinocchio-worthy characterization of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukraine president: \u201cThere\u2019s something interesting about this impeachment inquiry, ladies and gentlemen, because they are doing it in the Intelligence Committee. One of the things Trump said, by the way, is that Adam Schiff should be charged with treason.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\nFrom Limbaugh: \u201cSchiff is out there as the chairman of a committee, the Intelligence Committee, openly lying about the president\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine. \u2026 He literally said that the president told the Ukrainian president to \u2018create dirt,\u2019 to \u2018make it up, as much as you can.\u2019 When the Republicans finally called him on it, Schiff said, \u2018Well, I was just engaging parody. I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t seen.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThat\u2019s hardly parody. That\u2019s a lie.\n\n\u201cNone of what they are saying happened in that phone call did,\u201d Limbaugh went on, \u201cand we\u2019ve even got Never Trumpers now all over Fox News, \u2018Well, this phone call is very hard to defend. I wouldn\u2019t want to have to defend this phone call.\u2019 \u2026 There\u2019s nothing hard to defend about the phone call. You just don\u2019t want to defend it. You know, Fox really ought to change the name of the network from the Fox News Channel to the Fox Never Trumper Network, because that\u2019s who\u2019s getting the highlights, and they\u2019re bringing in Democrats like Donna Brazile.\u201d\n\nThe free market prevails.\n\nAnd Fox isn\u2019t the leader in cable news for nothing.\n\nBut then again: Limbaugh has a good pulse on conservative America. He\u2019s not a leader in talk radio for nothing.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
