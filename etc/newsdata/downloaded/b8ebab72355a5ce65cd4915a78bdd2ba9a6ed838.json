While the site is banning the problematic accounts, it\u2019s still a worrying trend.\n\nAccording a Wall Street Journal report, the organization is attempting to use the TikTok format to make themselves more appealing. Social media intelligence agency Storyful identified two dozen accounts spreading the bad news via TikTok. These accounts posted videos showing corpses, people singing ISIS songs, and women affirming a \u201cjihadist\u201d stance, often as hearts and stars pour across the screen. It sounds like a particularly macabre twist on the app\u2018s typical fare.\n\nThe app has since removed the two dozen accounts distributing the propaganda, as promoting terrorist organizations is against the company\u2019s rules, which state:\u201dTerrorist organizations and any other criminal organizations are strictly prohibited from using TikTok. DO NOT use TikTok to promote and support these organizations or individuals.\u201d\n\nWhile none of the accounts appear to have been particularly popular, at least a few did amass more than 1,000 followers, and one video the WSJ saw had 68 likes \u2014 which is a little worrying. It\u2019s also concerning that the company only removed the vids after WSJ flagged them. We\u2019ve reached out to TikTok to find out if the company has removed more videos like these in the past.\n\nGiven that a large number of TikTok\u2018s users (at least in my experience with the app) appear to be young and therefore malleable, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re the audience to whom the Islamic State is attempting to appeal. WSJ also reports that some of the accounts seemed to target young women in particular, with the extremist footage interspersed with pictures of running horses and attractive young men. (Admittedly, my first reaction was \u201cHow dare you bring the horses into this!\u201d)\n\nTikTok\u2019s been getting steadily more political since its spike in popularity. Last week, the company apparently rescinded its \u201cshadow ban\u201d on pro-Trump content. Before then, it would reportedly censor posts in certain areas of the world, with content relating to LGBTQ+ relationships and anything criticizing the Chinese government being banned in Turkey and China, respectively. For the record, TikTok is owned by Chinese company Byte Dance. The company has since said the rules which permitted those censorships were outdated.\n\nIslamic State Turns to Teen-Friendly TikTok, Adorning Posts With Pink Hearts on Wall Street Journal\n\nRead next: Amazon joins Facebook and Microsoft to fight deepfakes", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F07%2Ftiktok.png&signature=e58656bdcd87146ce7bf684a624d52fe", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
