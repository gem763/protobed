I want to access medical cannabis in the safe and proper way'\n\nDr Mikael Sodergren, managing director at Sapphire Clinics, said the private practice could now be the 'lifeline' for patients with debilitating conditions.\n\nHe said: 'Today's decision is a landmark moment in the supply of medical cannabis in the UK.\n\n'We can now be the lifeline for GPs who are not permitted to prescribe themselves but who think their patients could benefit from medical cannabis.\n\n'From today those GPs can be sure that their patients are able to be treated in the UK by world-class experts in their conditions.'\n\nHe added the decision could be 'life-changing' for patients who have been denied access to cannabis-based products.\n\nEmails seen by MailOnline confirm the private clinic in Marylebone is now registered, with the CQC wishing them well on their 'new venture'.\n\nSapphire has more than 50 people on its waiting list - with conditions ranging from severe epilepsy to chronic pain.\n\nAlfie Dingley, six, is one of only two children in the UK to have an NHS prescription for medical cannabis to treat his severe epilepsy. A campaign run by his family and the families of others with similar conditions were the tipping point for Government to legalise medical cannabis\n\nBilly Caldwell, 13, pictured with his mother Charlotte, thrust the cannabis debate into the limelight when Mrs Caldwell was stopped at Heathrow Airport while trying to smuggle cannabis oil home to her son, who is severely epileptic\n\nBut prescriptions will also be available to people with arthritis, MS, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as sufferers of psychiatric conditions and stroke patients.\n\nAn initial appointment at the Sapphire clinic will cost \u00a3250, and \u00a3150 for follow up visits.\n\nHOW IS MEDICAL CANNABIS SAID TO WORK? A broad term for any sort of cannabis-based medicine used to relieve symptoms. Some products that might claim to be medical cannabis, such as CBD oil or hemp oil, are available to buy legally as food supplements from health stores. But there's no guarantee these are of good quality or provide any health benefits. And some cannabis-based products are available on prescription as medicinal cannabis. These are only likely to benefit a very small number of patients. Epidiolex for children and adults with epilepsy Epidiolex is a highly purified liquid containing CBD (cannabidiol). CBD is a chemical substance found in cannabis that has medical benefits. It won't get you high, because it doesn't contain THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis. Epidiolex is not yet licensed in the UK but is currently going through the licensing system. In the meantime, the unlicensed medication can be prescribed for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome (both rare forms of epilepsy). Nabilone for chemotherapy patients Many people having chemotherapy will have periods where they feel sick or vomit. Nabilone can be prescribed by a specialist to help relieve these symptoms, but only when other treatments haven't helped or aren't suitable. Nabilone is a medicine, taken as a capsule, that has been developed to act in a similar way to THC. The medicine has been licensed in the UK. This means it has passed strict quality and safety tests, and is proven to have medical benefit. Nabiximols (Sativex) for MS Nabiximols (Sativex) is a cannabis-based medicine that is sprayed into the mouth It is licensed in the UK for people with MS-related muscle spasticity that hasn't got better with other treatments. But its availability on the NHS is limited. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend that NHS doctors prescribe Sativex, as it is not cost effective. There is some evidence medical cannabis can help certain types of pain, though this evidence is not yet strong enough to recommend it for pain relief.\n\nOnce given a prescription, patients will be able to take it to any pharmacy around the country, where the drugs will then be imported. It means prescriptions could take weeks to arrive.\n\nJacqueline Ward, who suffers from fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body, said she was 'elated' to hear the news.\n\nShe said: 'I want to access medical cannabis in the safe and proper way, and the go ahead from the CQC gives me confidence that soon I will be able to do just that.\n\n'When the law-changed last year I hoped access would be quicker because the pain I am in daily is utterly unbearable.\n\n'At last, the medical establishment in the UK is starting to catch up with countries like Holland and Canada.'\n\nMs Ward, from London, added: 'I am closer to getting access to medicine I need to have the quality of life I deserve.'\n\nThe cost of the medicinal cannabis to patients depends on dosage, as well as the contents of THC - the psychoactive substance in marijuana.\n\nCannabis-based products without this chemical, such as CBD oils, are already legal and available to buy on the high street.\n\nBut the bill will be markedly lower than the thousands of pounds some patients are currently forking out, Sapphire Clinics said.\n\nMailOnline reported last month families of severely epileptic children were paying up to \u00a32,000 a month on medicinal cannabis.\n\nThe tales of families forking out thousands of pounds to pay for private prescriptions and travelling abroad to bring cannabis oils back for their children were what persuaded the Government to legalise them last November.\n\nCases such as those of Billy Caldwell, 13, and Alfie Dingley, seven, highlighted the benefits of cannabis oil to children with epilepsy who suffer multiple seizures.\n\nBut since then, Billy and Alfie remain the only two children to have managed to get a prescription on the NHS.\n\nChildren suffering from severe, life-threatening seizures were dealt a huge blow in August when the NHS watchdog ruled against prescribing medicinal cannabis for their conditions.\n\nIn draft guidelines, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said cannabis should not be given to patients with multiple sclerosis or chronic pain.\n\nAnd it couldn't decide whether or not to approve it for children with rare forms of epilepsy because of a lack of evidence.\n\nCancer patients who are suffering from vomiting caused by chemotherapy were the only group for whom NICE approved cannabis medicines.\n\nIt meant desperate patients and their loved ones were signing up to private clinics which promised to start doling out the drugs.\n\nBut the surgeries were hamstrung by the fact they had to wait for approval by the CQC.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: MailOnline can reveal the Sapphire Medical Clinic in London has now been given the green-light to start dishing out cannabis-based medicines.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19303974-0-image-a-18_1570204983778.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
