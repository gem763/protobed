Lowry and mother to life", "language": "en", "text": "Mrs Lowry & Son (PG)\n\nVerdict: Ponderous yet moving\n\nThe Informer (15)\n\nVerdict: Gritty crime thriller\n\nMrs Lowry & Son chronicles the relationship between the painter L.S. Lowry (Timothy Spall) and his domineering and snobbish invalid mother (Vanessa Redgrave), long before anyone, let alone the two of them, had an inkling that his sooty townscapes and \u2018matchstick men\u2019 might one day be worth millions.\n\nIt\u2019s set in Pendlebury, Lancashire, in 1934 \u2014 in a world of fussy doilies, frilly lampshades and vanilla slices.\n\nI loved Mike Leigh\u2019s 2014 film Mr Turner, in which Spall played the great 19th century artist J.M.W. Turner.\n\nA scene in which \u2018Larry\u2019 takes his mother a cup of tea is eked out for so long that other films would fit in a battle and a victory parade in the same time. Yet the pace also allows Redgrave to act her bed- socks off, and Spall to inhabit the character with his customary excellence\n\nAs you might expect, he\u2019s no less captivating as Lowry, a very different painter and a very different man, meek but kind-hearted, revelling in his games with the neighbourhood children, and entirely in thrall to his monstrous mother, Elizabeth.\n\nThe film, by illustrious theatre director Adrian Noble, making a rare foray into cinema, never really attempts to smudge its origins as a radio play. This somehow both enables and disables the narrative, making it at times almost laughably ponderous.\n\nA scene in which \u2018Larry\u2019 takes his mother a cup of tea is eked out for so long that other films would fit in a battle and a victory parade in the same time.\n\nYet the pace also allows Redgrave to act her bed- socks off, and Spall to inhabit the character with his customary excellence.\n\nA few of Martyn Hesford\u2019s lines serve a little too much as a nod and a wink to the audience \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re not an artist and you never will be,\u2019 says Elizabeth, criticising Larry\u2019s \u2018squalid industrial scenes that nobody wants to buy\u2019. But there are a few ripe chuckles, too.\n\n\u2018What does he know about art?\u2019 she sneers of the man next door. \u2018He\u2019s a socialist.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s set in Pendlebury, Lancashire, in 1934 \u2014 in a world of fussy doilies, frilly lampshades and vanilla slices. I loved Mike Leigh\u2019s 2014 film Mr Turner, in which Spall played the great 19th century artist J.M.W. Turner\n\nA friend asked me only last week why nobody seems to make really good crime thrillers any more.\n\nThe kind with a corrupt cop or two and maybe an undercover guy in fear of his life. The kind that might still be recalled fondly a generation or more later, such as Witness (1985) or LA Confidential (1997).\n\nI couldn\u2019t argue with his assertion that multiplex audiences don\u2019t really want an overwhelming diet of superhero movies, crash-bang-wallop sequels and live-action remakes of Disney animations, with only the odd rom-com or biopic to leaven the mixture.\n\nBut wait. Here\u2019s The Informer, also packed with British talent, to remind us that the corrupt-cop thriller genre isn\u2019t face-up in the morgue just yet.\n\nAnd while it might not be in the same league as LA Confidential or Witness, it\u2019s a genuinely tense, gritty, New York City-set drama with a compelling leading man in Joel Kinnaman, and solid support from Rosamund Pike, whose fragrant English Rose period is now just a distant memory.\n\nOnce he has helped to nail the nasty Mr Big masterminding the operation, he will be absolved of his responsibilities to the Feds. But then a drug deal goes disastrously awry, ending in the death of a police officer\n\nShe plays FBI special agent Erica Wilcox, handler of an intrepid undercover man called Pete Koslow (Kinnaman). Incidentally, it\u2019s odd how frightfully middle-class English actresses keep being cast as hard-as-nails U.S. Feds.\n\nEmily Blunt filled a similar role a few years ago in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Sicario, which come to think of it was another exception to the rule that classy cinematic crime thrillers are a thing of the past.\n\nI wonder what it is that makes casting directors looking for the kind of hard-boiled American women that used to be called broads, call on the likes of Pike and Blunt?\n\nMaybe they discern an inner steel beneath the prettiness, forged out of the capable stoicism of all those female English forebears making their own marmalade and sending their officer-class men off to war.\n\nWhatever, Wilcox is another tough cookie, inflexible and even unscrupulous in the pursuit of bad guys. But Koslow is the one taking all the mortal risks.\n\nHe is a Gulf War hero, who returned to civilian life with post-traumatic stress disorder and ended up doing a jail term after killing a man in a bar fight for abusing his pretty wife.\n\nThen he was sprung from the notorious Bale Hill prison by the FBI, on the understanding that he would use his skills to go undercover in the Polish mafia.\n\nKoslow\u2019s job for the mob is to shepherd drugs, smuggled into the U.S. in a diplomatic bag, through the Polish consulate in New York.\n\nOnce he has helped to nail the nasty Mr Big masterminding the operation, he will be absolved of his responsibilities to the Feds. But then a drug deal goes disastrously awry, ending in the death of a police officer.\n\nThe crime boss blames Koslow, who, by way of penance, and with his beloved wife and daughter held as bargaining tools, must become an inmate again at Bale Hill in order to take control of drugs distribution there.\n\nThe Polish overlord will not only make vast sums of money from needy prisoners, but can also manipulate them when they come out.\n\nSo Koslow returns to the prison he worked so hard to leave, which is OK because he has the FBI to protect him, or thinks he does.\n\nWilcox\u2019s boss is a treacherous cove played by British actor Clive Owen, although the sneaky Feds might just have met their match in a determined NYPD detective (played by the rapper Common), who is investigating the death of his colleague in the botched drug deal.\n\nOriginally, this film was titled Three Seconds, after the novel by the Swedish author Anders Roslund on which it is based.\n\nThe Italian director Andrea di Stefano has adapted it skilfully, with help from a British screenwriter, Rowan Joffe.\n\nThat\u2019s an admirably multinational team behind a film that feels not just distinctly American but carries that particular whiff of New York City underbelly, of sweat and pretzels and acrid steam rising from subway gratings.\n\nTilda's girl in a tale of secrets and lies\n\nAlso showing...\n\nJoanna Hogg\u2019s achingly middle-class films aren\u2019t everybody\u2019s cup of decaffeinated Earl Grey, indeed they aren\u2019t really mine, but I can appreciate their quiet intensity.\n\nThe Souvenir (15) is set in London in the early Eighties, when the city was squarely in the sights of IRA bombers.\n\nJulie (Honor Swinton Byrne) is an aspiring filmmaker from a well-off family, who has chosen working-class Sunderland for her latest project, largely because she wants to break out of her privileged bubble.\n\nShe is a polite, considerate, sweet-natured young woman, sensitively played by Byrne in her debut feature role, with support \u2014 doubtless in more ways than one \u2014 from her real-life mother Tilda Swinton, who also plays her mother on screen.\n\nSweet and sour: Swinton Byrne and Burke. Joanna Hogg\u2019s achingly middle-class films aren\u2019t everybody\u2019s cup of decaffeinated Earl Grey, indeed they aren\u2019t really mine, but I can appreciate their quiet intensity\n\nJulie lives in her mum\u2019s Knightsbridge pied-a-terre, where others rather prey on her decency and naivety.\n\nBut the main predator in this story is Anthony (Tom Burke), an urbane, smooth-talking fellow a few years older than her, who claims to have a mysterious job at the Foreign Office.\n\nSoon they are lovers, but Anthony has been hiding another secret: he is a heroin addict. By now, however, Julie is hooked on him.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad tale, and apparently semi-autobiographical, which makes it even more reminiscent of 2009\u2019s An Education, based on Lynn Barber\u2019s memoir. Swinton, as so often, steals every scene she\u2019s in, which in this case means pinching from her own daughter.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t appear much, but there\u2019s a marvellous early scene when she comes to the flat and makes brisk maternal \u2018suggestions\u2019, unthinkingly lifting Julie\u2019s hands to check whether she\u2019s biting her nails. It\u2019s very subtly and beautifully done.\n\nRating:\n\nThere\u2019s no subtlety in Asterix: The Secret Of The Magic Potion (PG) , a somewhat lumpen animation based on the French comic stories which are 60 years old this year.\n\nI was never into Asterix as a child and never introduced him to my own kids, so I can\u2019t really comment on whether this film stays true to the spirit of the original tales. Given how Americanised it is, I suspect not.\n\nIt follows the quest of elderly wizard Getafix to find a young druid worthy of receiving the highly secret recipe of, you\u2019ve guessed it, a magic potion.\n\nMuch of the dialogue will fly well over the heads of the target audience, but there are a few half-decent gags aimed at grown-ups, and a silly Roman senator called Tomcrus, pronounced Tom Cruise.\n\nRating:\n\nRough, tough and in the buff!\n\nA Million Little Pieces (15)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Interesting but flawed\n\nJames Frey is a reformed crack addict and alcoholic, who got clean, sobered up, and wrote a thunderously successful memoir called A Million Little Pieces, parts of which he was later found to have invented.\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s drama, of which Frey is one of the executive producers, offers no hint of the controversy. It begins with Frey (played by the director\u2019s husband, Aaron Taylor-Johnson) in a drug-addled frenzy at the end of which he falls backwards off a balcony.\n\nHis family then contrive to get him put on a plane to Minneapolis, where his brother checks him into a rehabilitation clinic. The film, co-written by Sam and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, follows his experiences in rehab.\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s drama, of which Frey is one of the executive producers, offers no hint of the controversy. It begins with Frey (played by the director\u2019s husband, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, above) in a drug-addled frenzy at the end of which he falls backwards off a balcony\n\nIt\u2019s tough to watch, which of course is no criticism; done properly, films like this always are. But it suffers unnecessarily from a dearth of characterisation. Frey arrives on screen fully formed as an addict and leaves it well on the way to recovery.\n\nExcept for a whimsical sequence in which he sits on a bench next to his younger self, we are told very little of his story, his background, his personality, which makes it difficult to root for him.\n\nWe learn that he broke his parents\u2019 hearts, but that\u2019s the first and last we hear of them. His brother (Charlie Hunnam) features only briefly.\n\nMaybe this is deliberate, encouraging us to define him only by his addiction and his efforts to overcome it, which are facilitated by his growing friendship with a fellow patient, Lilly (Odessa Young).\n\nBut two other recent films with the same theme, last year\u2019s Beautiful Boy and Ben Is Back, gripped me much more because I felt an investment in their central characters, which is lacking here.\n\nAll that said, Taylor-Johnson gives a heck of a performance, not so much acting his heart out as acting his guts up.\n\nHe gets charismatic support too from Billy Bob Thornton, playing another patient, who becomes his mentor. I was reminded at times of One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest (1975), which is never a bad thing.\n\nOne final observation: there are a couple of pretty gratuitous full-frontal shots of Taylor-Johnson naked, his admittedly arresting manhood there for all the world to see.\n\nI wondered about this, knowing that the director is his wife. It feels a little like boasting, on her part if not his.\n\nRound-up from the Venice film festival\n\nCatherine Deneuve got the 76th Venice Film Festival off to a suitably glamorous start on Wednesday, playing, not exactly against type, a grand old French actress in The Truth.\n\nDeneuve might hope that the comparisons stop there, because her character, Fabienne, is a vain, self-absorbed diva, whose forthcoming autobiography paints her as an attentive mother.\n\nHer daughter Lumir (Juliette Binoche), who is married to an American TV actor (Ethan Hawke), knows otherwise.\n\nWriter-director Hiro-kazu Kore-ada\u2019s bittersweet comedy about mother-daughter relationships is a little laboured in parts and far from the rousing curtain-raiser we sometimes get here in Venice, but it\u2019s a treat to see 75-year-old Deneuve giving such a playful performance, in particular a priceless Gallic shrug at the expense of Brigitte Bardot.\n\nRating:\n\nLast night\u2019s world premiere of Ad Astra packed a bigger punch. James Gray\u2019s ambitious sci-fi drama stars Brad Pitt as a courageous astronaut, Roy McBride, sent all the way to Neptune to find his long-lost father Clifford (Tommy Lee Jones).\n\nClifford was the hero of an earlier mission to find intelligent life in the outer reaches of the galaxy. Though long considered to have perished, he is now believed to be still alive and responsible in some way for power surges threatening the entire solar system.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of baffling science but the film throbs with energy and empathy, thanks mostly to Pitt\u2019s powerful performance as a loyal spaceman and conflicted son.\n\nRating:\n\nI loved Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach\u2019s funny, painful analysis of divorce, American-style.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are wonderful as parents of a young son who, but for the Californian lawyers they hire, deliciously played by Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta, might have a chance of reconciliation.\n\nIt\u2019s a Netflix film but will have a cinematic release in November. If you are, or have ever been, married, don\u2019t miss it.\n\nRating:\n\nThe Vulture\n\nIf you see one thing\n\nOn Show\n\nThis is the first museum exhibition of her paintings for 16 years, so you can judge for yourself\n\nKings Of Leon, Rudimental, right, and Little Mix are among the acts visiting Liverpool\u2019s Sefton Park this weekend for the Fusion Presents and Fusion Festivals\n\nBridget Riley\n\n\u2018Op Art\u2019 as it was once called, had a great vogue in the 1960s but Bridget Riley, one of its founders, who has been working for 60 years, is the last one standing, and now sometimes called our \u2018greatest living painter\u2019.\n\nThis is the first museum exhibition of her paintings for 16 years, so you can judge for yourself.\n\nRoyal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh, until September 22\n\nRobin Simon\n\nOn Tour\n\nFusion Festival\n\nKings Of Leon, Rudimental, right, and Little Mix are among the acts visiting Liverpool\u2019s Sefton Park this weekend for the Fusion Presents and Fusion Festivals.\n\nThe entertainment gets underway today (August 30) as Kings Of Leon are joined by Franz Ferdinand, Jake Bugg, Echo & The Bunnymen and Sam Fender for the rock-orientated Fusion Presents.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s sister event, Fusion Festival, features Rudimental and continues into Sunday with Little Mix, Anne-Marie and Mabel (thefusionfestival.co.uk).\n\nAdrian Thrills\n\nHolliday Grainger, above, is the detective digging deeper.
