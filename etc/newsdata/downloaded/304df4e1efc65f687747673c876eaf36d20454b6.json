Look at that shit-eating grin. She's a big fat cheater and she's loving it.\n\nIn the latest performative wokeness stunt from a big corporate brand, Hasbro has unveiled its latest Monopoly edition: Ms. Monopoly.\n\nIts goal? To celebrate women trailblazers. Great! Women deserve to be celebrated just as much as men. If the recent 'Forbes listing only one woman on their list of 100 innovators' snafu is anything to go by, women need more recognition. After all, women invented the world's first computer program, windscreen wipers, kevlar, the dishwasher \u2014 heck, they invented half of maths.\n\nThey discovered radiation, dark matter and nuclear fission. They've conquered mountains and oceans and even the Australian government. Women are great \u2014 I would know; I am one. And how does Hasbro celebrate these world-changing trailblazers?\n\nBy telling them they can't win at Monopoly without cheating.\n\nIn Ms. Monopoly, out this November, \"women receive 20 per cent more Monopoly Dollars when they pass GO than men \u2013 a fun spin in the game that creates a world where women have an advantage.\" That's according to the official press release, which, to be honest, is the most patronising bullgarbage I've seen in a long time.\n\nOne might argue that it's a tongue-in-cheek way of poking fun at the historic inequality faced by women \u2014 specifically, women in business \u2014 but I don't think it's been very well thought-out or considered. As even my own track record proves, women are perfectly capable of winning at Monopoly without having an unfair advantage. What's more, the whole gimmick cheapens what would have been a pretty cool set. As I said earlier, women deserve to be celebrated, but a board game that turns them into straight up cheaters as a 'symbolic gesture'?\n\nIt's a no from me. Kotaku Australia has reached out to Hasbro for comment, and we'll update this story with their statement should they respond.", "description": "Look at her. Look at that shit-eating grin.
