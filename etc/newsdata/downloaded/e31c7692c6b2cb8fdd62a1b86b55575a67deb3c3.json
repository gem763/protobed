Prices are below the 50-day moving average line but that condition has happened a few times in the past year and still PG continued to rally.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows only a slight decline in recent weeks so we should not worry that investors have become aggressive sellers.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has declined to the zero line similar to what it did in June the last time PG tested the 50-day moving average line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of PG, below, we can see that prices have been traveling north/northeast since early 2018 in a \"textbook\" uptrend.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has moved higher to confirm the gains and the MACD oscillator has been rising as well. Recently the MACD oscillator crossed to a take profits sell signal but that may not be long sustained.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of PG, below, we can see that prices reached a long-term price target but we have yet to see any signs of distribution (selling). PG is probably going to trade sideways for a few weeks before renewed gains.\n\nBottom line strategy: Without a top formation or signs of liquidation or distribution, I suspect that PG will move still higher in the months ahead. In the short run I would look for some sideways price action. This sideways action could be used to build a long position.", "description": "Let's review the charts of PG to see if there are any risk levels or targets to be aware of....PG", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Procter", "Gamble Is Likely To Trade Sideways Before Renewed Gains", "Let'S Review The Charts Of Pg To See If There Are Any Risk Levels Or Targets To Be Aware Of.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/00aaaa03-b23b-11e9-ad16-8bbf6cc589aa.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
