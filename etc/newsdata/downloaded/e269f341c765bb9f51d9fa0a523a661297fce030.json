Figs seem to crop long into October in Greece and Spain, and I love them roasted in autumnal salads such as this one. As for beyond the end of October, I mean to plant my own fig tree in the back garden as soon as I possibly can, so that I can enjoy this most luscious of fruits, with or without our imminent divorce.\n\nAn autumn salad of roasted red onions, figs, blue cheese and walnuts\n\nSweet from the figs and sticky onions, salty and creamy from the cheese: salads should never be boring.\n\nPrep 30 min\n\nCook 25 min\n\nServes 4\n\n2 red onions, peeled and cut into eighths through the stem\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n2 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n\n4-5 tbsp olive oil\n\n1-2 tsp soft brown sugar\n\n6 ripe figs, sliced in half widthways\n\n75g walnuts\n\nJuice of \u00bd lemon\n\n1 head radicchio, finely shredded\n\n100g watercress\n\n120g blue cheese, such as Stichelton or Oxford Blue\n\nThomasina Miers' recipe for mussels with fregola, 'nduja and baby tomatoes | The Simple Fix Read more\n\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Scatter the onions in a large tray, season generously and drizzle with a tablespoon of the vinegar and enough olive oil to coat them all. Toss with your hands, lightly scatter with brown sugar, then roast for 10 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, put the figs cut side down on a different tray, and season with salt, pepper, a little brown sugar and a drizzle of olive oil. Roast with the onions for another 10-12 minutes, until the figs are slightly softened and releasing their juices and the onions are crisp around the edges, but otherwise tender and sweet.\n\nDrizzle the figs with the rest of the balsamic vinegar. Put the walnuts in a small baking tray and roast for five minutes in the same oven until slightly darker in colour and smelling nutty. Remove from the oven and run a sharp knife through them once or twice to break them up a little.\n\nPour any juice from the figs\u2019 roasting tray into a small bowl or cup, and whisk in two to three tablespoons of oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. Season to taste.\n\nWash the leaves and pat dry. Arrange them on one large plate (or individual plates) and top with the silky red onion. Sit the figs among the onions and dot around the cheese. Scatter over the walnuts, dress and serve.\n\nAnd for the rest of the week\n\nToast extra walnuts and put them on the breakfast table \u2013 they are irresistible and a great start to the day.
