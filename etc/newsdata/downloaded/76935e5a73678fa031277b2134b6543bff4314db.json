Trump held court twice on Thursday -- once at a photo availability with the Finnish President and once in a more formal press briefing -- and then worked the media rope line outside the White House for more than 20 minutes Friday morning before heading to Walter Reed hospital.\n\nThe President talking to the media is a good thing! For the media and the American public! But man oh man, is it a bad thing for this President -- especially as he tries to downplay the potential damage the ongoing impeachment inquiry in the House could do him.\n\nWhy? Because Trump has a habit of saying the quiet part out loud. Like on Thursday, when he said this about his desire for the Ukrainians to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter\n\n\"Well I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens. Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.
