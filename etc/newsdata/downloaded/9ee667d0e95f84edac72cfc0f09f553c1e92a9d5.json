He couldn\u2019t believe we were just giving it out for free and was so grateful.\u2019\n\nThey\u2019ve donated as many as 170 a month (Picture: Moosa Nsubuga)\n\nMoosa hopes to take the initiative around the country.\n\n\u2018The plan is to do it full-time,\u2019 he continues. \u2018We are a small team and we\u2019d like to have access to our own space storage and office.\n\n\u2018We are planning a UK tour in 2020 from Portsmouth all the way up to Liverpool on a five-city tour collecting and distributing sneakers.\n\n\u2018Thanks to the sneakerhead community we have wide support across the country.\u2019\n\nResole has a drop-off point at Copit UK and Vamp LND, a sneaker shop in Brixton with a cleaning service where people can go to drop off donations at the bin located in the store.\n\nShoes that need cleaning are washed before they\u2019re collected for distribution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Meet the Londoners showing \u2018solidarity not charity\u2019 with the homeless community\n\nMORE: Homeless cat lands a job at a law firm after people complained about him hanging around\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "South Londoner Moosa Nsubuga wanted to give back to the community after being raised in a culture of helping one another out.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trainers-social-image-8bdf_1571223685.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
