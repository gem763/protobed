Walker said that the student's lawyers argued that the note is protected under the First Amendment while defendants had argued that it was not.\n\n\"All my daughter ever wanted was for students to feel safe speaking out about sexual assault. I\u2019m so proud of her for standing up for what she believes in. We\u2019re thrilled about today\u2019s decision,\" the student's mother, Shael Norris, said in a statement.", "description": "A federal judge in Maine this week halted the suspension of a girl who post", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/metoo_movement12312018.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
