A further 1,463 volunteers have been arrested in the past week in another 20 cities, including Brussels, Amsterdam, New York, Sydney and Toronto, according to the group's tally. More protests in this latest wave are due in the coming days.\n\nWhile many scientists have tended to shun overt political debate, preferring to confine their public pronouncements within the parameters of their research, the academics backing Extinction Rebellion say they feel compelled to speak out.\n\n\"The urgency of the crisis is now so great that many scientists feel, as humans, that we now have a moral duty to take radical action,\" Grossman told Reuters.\n\nOther signatories included several scientists who contributed to the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has produced a series of reports underscoring the urgency of dramatic cuts in carbon emissions. Rebellion's flag is a stylised symbol of an hourglass in a circle, and its disruptive tactics include peacefully occupying bridges and roads.\n\nThe group has electrified supporters who said they had despaired at the failure of conventional campaigning to spur action. But its success in paralysing parts of London has also angered critics who complained the movement has inconvenienced thousands of people and diverted police resources.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is aligned with a school strike movement inspired by Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, which mobilised millions of young people on Sept. 20. It hopes the scientists' support for the urgency of its message and its embrace of civil disobedience will bolster its legitimacy and draw more volunteers.\n\nThe group said more than half the signatories of the declaration are experts in the fields of climate science and the loss of wildlife. Although British universities and institutes were well represented, signatories also worked in countries including the United States, Australia, Spain and France.", "description": "Scientists endorse mass civil disobedience to force climate action", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_5_800x533_L_1412601619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
