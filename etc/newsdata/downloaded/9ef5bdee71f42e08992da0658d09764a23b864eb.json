Businesses operate across borders and people travel for work, for play and to live.\n\nThat means there\u2019s more demand than ever for smooth, simple and affordable money transfer services.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn fact, last year the World Bank predicted that global remittances would grow 4.6 per cent to $642 billion (\u00a3520 billion) by the end of 2018 alone.\n\nThe cost of international money transfers can really vary. At the start of 2018, the global average cost of sending $200 was 7.1 per cent. And Sub-Saharan Africa was the most expensive place to send money to, where the average cost is 9.4 per cent.\n\nSo if you want to transfer money overseas then how can you be sure you are getting the best service and at the best price? Well, fortunately the market has become far more competitive and there\u2019s a wide variety of options. Here are a few.\n\nBest for convenience\n\nOne of the best-known names in the money transfer game, Western Union has been around far longer than many of the fintech apps and new banking products.\n\nIt offers fast and reliable international money transfers to over 200 countries and territories. As well as 5,200 physical locations where you can go and arrange a transfer, it also offers a smooth online or app-based service.\n\nWhen you arrange a transfer, you receive a tracking number that can be shared with the recipient, allowing you to both keep track of where the money is at all times.\n\nBest for speedy transfers\n\nWe expect to be able to make transfers within moments but that\u2019s not always possible when it comes to international payments. However, WorldRemit does a good job.\n\nIt claims that customers can send money via their mobile as quickly as a text message, once they have registered and installed the app.\n\nWorldRemit allows money to be sent to 140 different countries, as mobile credit, cash for collection, a bank deposit or even a mobile top-up. It also claims to have the highest possible security standards.\n\nOne thing to be aware of \u2013 fees vary depending on the destination and amount, so make sure you are clear about the costs before you hit go.\n\nRight now if you use the code 3FREE, you can get the first three transfers without any charge.\n\nFor small payments\n\nThe cost of making international transfers can put people off making smaller payments but sometimes that\u2019s what people need to do.\n\nAzimo is a good option for these smaller payments as it has competitive fees starting as low as \u00a31 and capped at \u00a315. You can transfer as little as \u00a310, making this a good option for those smaller payments.\n\nThe company offers transfers to over 195 countries and the cash can be received directly into a bank, as cash to collect, via home delivery, mobile top-up or mobile wallet.\n\nFree transfers\n\nThe bank HSBC lets people send money online for just \u00a34, available 24 hours a day through online banking. Last year its customers sent more than 1.3 million payments to over 150 different countries.\n\nIf you\u2019re making regular payments to a specific person then it may make sense for you to both open an HSBC account. When the receiver also has an HSBC account, there is no fee to pay at all.\n\nIt\u2019s still a good idea to look at the exchange rate and compare that with other payment providers, but this can be a good way to make fee-free international transfers.\n\nFor confidence\n\nWhen you\u2019re trusting a company to take your money and transport it safely to another country, it can be reassuring to go with a big well-known brand\n\nPayPal has been one of the market-leaders in money transfers for a long time and its Xoom service offers a simple way to send money abroad fast.\n\nYou can make international bank transfers, top up a mobile, send cash for collection or delivery and even pay someone\u2019s bills from afar.\n\nIf you already have a PayPal account then you can set up Xoom in just a few minutes, and the recipient doesn\u2019t need to be a PayPal customer.\n\nFor low fees\n\nThis currency company works slightly differently to most international payment firms. Instead of transferring cash, you pay your money into the UK balance and your recipient receives their cash from Transferwise\u2019s reserve of their currency.\n\nThe MoneySavingExpert website says this company offers one of the lowest transfer rates they have seen, starting at just \u00a31. Transferwise itself claims to be eight times cheaper on average than \u2018leading UK high street banks\u2019.\n\nHowever, as with all of these firms, it\u2019s important to compare the specific cost the amount and country you are considering so you can be sure you are on the best rate.\n\nBest for larger sums\n\nBetter known for its prepaid cards, FairFX also provides a money transfer service that is fee-free if you\u2019re sending over \u00a3500.\n\nIt also usually offers a good exchange rate, which can make all the difference when moving money around, so this is a good place to compare prices for larger transfers.", "description": "If you need to send money abroad, here\u2019s where\u2019s best for fees, security and convenience Money has never flowed around the world as much as it does today.
