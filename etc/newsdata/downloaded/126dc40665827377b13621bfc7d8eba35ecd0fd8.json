Families with children aged five and above took an average of 5.6 holidays during the year, both in the UK and half overseas. Families with younger children took an average of 3.9 breaks.\n\nAbta cities \u201ca great range of excellent value holidays and destinations\u201d available to UK passengers for the increase \u2013 including brisk demand for package holidays, which 51 per cent of UK travellers took this year.\n\nTop destinations for package holidays included mainland Spain, the Canaries, the Balearics, Greece and Turkey; with double-digit growth in package holidays to Egypt, Turkey and Bulgaria.\n\nElsewhere, Abta said France, North America and Italy were perennial favourites for all types of break; while long-haul travel was also booming, with a quarter of people visiting Asia this year, up from 15 per cent in 2018.\n\nGoing forward, travel is still a \u201cspending priority\u201d for Britons. Seven in 10 people are planning a trip overseas in the next 12 months, with Europe top of the bucket list.\n\n\u201cThe British public\u2019s appetite for taking holidays has continued unabated in the past 12 months,\u201d said Mark Tanzer, Abta chief executive.\n\n\u201cThis has partly been due to the wide variety of excellent value for money options available this year, and also because holidays are a priority when it comes to discretionary spend.\n\n\u201cRather than cutting back on the number of holidays, people are looking to save money in their holiday budget in other ways \u2013 spending less before and while they\u2019re away, and changing when they book to find better deals.\u201d\n\nThe data comes as the expected growth in air travel passenger numbers could halve due to climate change fears, according to new research.\n\nSwiss bank UBS surveyed more than 6,000 people from the UK, US, Germany and France about their flying habits, and found the rise of \u201cflight shame\u201d or flygskam seems to be spreading.\n\nMore than a fifth (21 per cent) of those surveyed said had they had intentionally reduced the number of flights they took over the last year.\n\nBritons are the most prolific international travellers, according to data from the International Air Transport Association (Iata).\n\nIn 2018, 126.2 million passengers were British \u2013 totalling 8.6 per cent, roughly one in 12, of all international travellers.\n\nThe UK was followed by the US (111.5 million, or 7.6 per cent of all passengers) and China (97 million, 6.6 per cent).", "description": "Nearly nine in 10 British travellers took a holiday this year, the highest level for eight years, in spite of a rise in the \u201cflight shame\u201d campaign.
