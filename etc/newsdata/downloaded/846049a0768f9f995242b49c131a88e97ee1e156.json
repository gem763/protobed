They are based on engineering analysis from Hydro Tasmania's cable experts that have concluded that an existing reduction in the operating limit of the cable when exporting power to Victoria is not sufficient and that a further reduction is necessary to reduce the chances of failure.\n\nThe new constraints apply to supply in both directions and so reduce Tasmania's capacity to import power from the mainland, which wasn't affected until the initial reduction in capacity.\n\nThe disagreement deepens an existing dispute between Hydro Tasmania and Basslink over the operation of the cable which has been ongoing since a six-month outage on the line from December 2015 until June 2016. Hydro Tasmania determined that operational stress on the line had degraded the cable, a finding disputed by Basslink Pty.\n\nThe cable has since suffered two more major outages, including a one-month shutdown in August-September this year.\n\nBasslink said on Tuesday that the \"preliminary recommendation\" that Hydro Tasmania had received on July 24 from technical expert DNV GL to limit the interconnector's capacity had not been validated, is based on assumptions and is subject to ongoing analysis by the Norwegian firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt said it had provided Hydro Tasmania with an independent response from its own experts, Cable Consulting International, which raised concerns about the reliability of the information used by DNV and that the restriction of capacity by the use of pricing instructions was unnecessary.\n\n\"Despite these concerns, Hydro Tasmania has not provided Basslink with any further work or investigation conducted by DNV GL beyond the preliminary evaluation three months ago,\" Basslink said.\n\nBasslink said it had \"no choice\" but to comply with Hydro Tasmania's instructions under the services agreement between the two for the cable. The opearating restructions won't affect fees payable to Basslink under that contract, nor is the Basslink telecom cable that provides broadband services affected, it added.", "description": "The chief executive of the power cable to Tasmania has warned that instructions to limit operations on the line will drive up prices and reduce competition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e83d301f094ac9d6fb3f0ee3541454bac7130227", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
