And with winter fast approaching, no solution has been found.\n\nAccusing Vladimir Putin of trying to \u2018freeze Ukraine\u2019 after talks failed on Tuesday, he claims the Russian President does not want to sign an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe must be ready for the most difficult scenario,\u201d Yatsenyuk said at a military training camp at Yavoriv, in the western Lviv region.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have 17 billion cubic metres of gas. If the EU additionally opens reverse flows to us \u2013 because we are already receiving 60 percent of gas by reverse \u2013 then it will hugely ease the way we survive winter.\u201d\n\nA ceasefire has not stopped fighting around Donetsk airport in the east of Ukraine, terrorising local people.\n\nLeading human rights group, Human Rights Watch, claims government forces have used cluster bombs in populated areas \u2013 something Kyiv denies.\n\n\u201cThe shelling goes on every night, around the clock,\u201d said Vera Anoshina, a resident of Spartak village near Donetsk.\n\n\u201cYesterday they shot so hard the ground was shaking. But if we leave, others left behind here will lose their faith. Out of 5,000 people in the village, there are roughly 400 left.\u201d\n\nNearly every nearby building has been either damaged or destroyed.\n\nLeft without power due to the fighting, villagers are doing what they can to keep warm, such as chopping firewood. By the end of this week, temperatures are forecast to drop below freezing.", "description": "Visiting troops ahead of Sunday\u2019s parliamentary election, Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk knows the fight against separatist rebels is not", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2014-10-22"}
