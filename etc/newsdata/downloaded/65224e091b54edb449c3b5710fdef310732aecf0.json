(IONS) : \"This is a battleground. I like Seattle Genetics (SGEN) ,\" said Jim Cramer. SGEN is a new name to me so let's check out the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of SGEN, below, we can see that the prices have just about doubled in the past 12 months. The rally in the past two months has been pretty impressive with a recent strong upside gap. SGEN is above the rising 50-day and the rising 200-day moving average lines.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has turned upward in the past two months to support and confirm the price advance and tell us that buyers of SGEN have been more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a strong bullish configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of SGEN, below, we went back four years to see the full size of the multi-year consolidation pattern and upside breakout. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been moving upward with the price action telling us that buyers of SGEN have been more aggressive. The weekly MACD oscillator is bullish and pointing higher.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SGEN, below, we can see the recent rally and a potential upside price target of $147.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Because SGEN has a bullish setup on its charts I would not wait for any dip or pullback to go long. Try to buy a position around $100, risk below $94 for now. Our price objective is $147.", "description": "Seattle Genetics: Where's This Biotech Stock Headed From Here?...IONS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Seattle Genetics", "Where'S This Biotech Stock Headed Here", "Time To Check The Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/seattlegeneticssign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
