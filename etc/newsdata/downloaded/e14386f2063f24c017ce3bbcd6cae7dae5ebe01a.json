The platform said that posts promoting and making \u201cmiraculous\u201d claims about these products and services that also include a price tag (or something like a discount code) will not be shown to users under 18. Instagram says it worked with \u201cexternal experts\u201d like Dr. Ysabel Gerrard, a social-media researcher at the University of Sheffield, to create the new policy.\n\nAlso being credited is actress Jameela Jamil, who told Elle that she met with Instagram following a widely circulated petition she launched to \u201cstop celebrities promoting toxic diet products on social media.\u201d The Good Place actress, who has been open about her struggles with body image and disordered eating, runs the popular body-positivity account \u201cI Weigh.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Jamil\u2019s body-positivity crusade has faced backlash, namely for its well-meaning but misguided attempts at useful activism \u2014 activism that is often belied by her inability to recognize the standards of beauty and success that women, including herself, must navigate. She\u2019s often praised for publicly dragging other celebrities, but her attacks have been mean-spirited and are almost exclusively directed at her female peers, among them Beyonc\u00e9, Kim Kardashian, and Cardi B. (Full disclosure: She was a little mean to me on Twitter once.)\n\nHer missives range from righteous outrage (the Kardashians are \u201cdouble agents for the patriarchy\u201d) to outright mockery (\u201cI hope all these celebrities all shit their pants in public, the way the poor women who buy this nonsense upon their recommendation do\u201d). As Hannah Giorgis put it in The Atlantic last year, it\u2019s a brand of activism that relies on the harsh judgment of other women, but always \u201caccording to a rubric she herself is not evaluated by.\u201d\n\nThat said, it seems that some of Jamil\u2019s (widely and wildly thrown) missiles have reached their targets. While her voice on the issue of body positivity has, at times, been loud and confusing (e.g., Photoshop should be banned, and women that filter their selfies are complicit with the patriarchy) it has also been insightful and necessary, like when Avon pulled an ad that targeted women\u2019s cellulite after she yelled at them.\n\nAnd when it comes to protecting young people from the dangers of diet products and culture, it seems like Jamil\u2019s crusade \u2014 however flawed \u2014 might just be doing the trick.", "description": "Jameela Jamil\u2019s anti-diet crusade has sort of worked to stop diet products from being promoted to minors on Instagram.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/18-jameela-jamil-c.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
