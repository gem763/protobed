Pictured: Liddell Power Station in Muswellbrook, New South Wales\n\nMr Morrison announced the federal government's involvement on Monday.\n\n'This is about putting downward pressure on wholesale prices to make sure businesses and households have access to reliable and affordable power,' he said.\n\n'Industry needs certainty. They need to know their electricity won't cut out, and their power bill won't suddenly double.'\n\n'That's why we are underwriting this interconnector. It's a practical step to make sure it happens, and it happens quickly.'\n\nFederal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the project will lead to 'greater competition between generators in the electricity market, helping to reduce wholesale prices'.\n\nThis is a small project but a good project\n\nHe added: 'This is great news for the energy-intensive industries, and the jobs and regional economies that rely on them.'\n\nExperts have supported the move, including Mr Dundaf of the Gratton Institute.\n\n'This is a small project but a good project,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'According to my analysis, the average household will save about $1 or $2 per year on their annual bills over the 25-year lifetime of the project.'\n\nBrian Fisher, managing director of BAEconomics, told Daily Mail Australia he also backed the project.\n\n'The fact is that Queensland is a net exporter of power and getting that power to New South Wales and Victoria is important in terms of stabilising the grid,' he said.\n\nThe project, which needs to be signed off by the energy regulator, is due to be completed by 2023.", "description": "Network operator\u00a0TransGrid will upgrade to the transmission link between Queensland and New South Wales so more electricity can flow between the states.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20257458-0-image-a-7_1572214082798.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
