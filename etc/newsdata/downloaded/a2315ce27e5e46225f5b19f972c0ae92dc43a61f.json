The risk of this is higher in pregnant woman who are expecting more than one baby\n\nPregnancy complications, such as anaemia, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. The risk of placental abruption (the placenta detaching itself early) is also higher.\n\nPremature labour and birth. Nearly all multiples higher than twins are born before 37 weeks, with triplets having a 94 per cent chance of being born prematurely \u2013 meaning the risk is also there for quads.\n\nLow birth weight as a result of being born prematurely.\n\nIntrauterine growth restriction, which sees babies\u2019 growth slowing down earlier than in pregnancy with a single baby. Quadruplet growth begins slowing down at around 25 to 26 weeks\n\nBabies born in multiple births are also at higher risk of birth defects such as spina bifida, cerebral palsy and other neural tube defects, as well as being at higher risk of problems with the heart and digestive tracts.\n\nWhile most multiple pregnancies are healthy and result in healthy babies, all of the above can occur \u2013 so if you\u2019re pregnant with two or more babies be sure not to miss any of your antenatal appointments, so that any problems can be identified early and treated if need be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more information visit the NHS website\u2019s page on multiple births.\n\nHow many quadruplets are there in the world?\n\nWith the chances of producing four babies at once so low, Gemma and Chesney are set to enter into a pretty elite club of quadruplet parents.\n\nAs of 2007 there were approximately 3,500 sets of quads worldwide \u2013 of which only around 70 are all-identical quadpulets.\n\nMany sets of quadruplets contain identical and fraternal sibllings in some combination.\n\nAlthough rare, quadruplets are becoming more common due to fertility treatments which can often result in multiple pregnancies.\n\nCoronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on ITV at 7.30pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
