Safety of the crew and execution of the mission come first.\u201d\n\nShe returned to Earth in June and Nasa sent a second medium-size spacesuit up to the station earlier this month.\n\nSpacesuits are made of many interchangeable parts \u2013 designed to accommodate astronauts with widely varying body sizes.\n\nBody measurements of each astronaut are taken and plotted against the size ranges available for each spacesuit component. The suits are then assembled \u2013 usually four months prior to flight.\n\nWhile there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\n\nThe scheduled spacewalk will see Ms Koch and Ms Meir venture outside the ISS wearing medium-size suits to replace the faulty device, known as the battery charge-discharge unit (BCDU), which has been in operation since 2000.\n\nIt failed to activate after new lithium-ion batteries were installed on the space station last week.\n\nThere have been 227 spacewalkers since the first spacewalk in 1965. Only 14 women have performed spacewalks, always accompanied by men.\n\nMs Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September.\n\nBoth are members of Nasa\u2019s Astronaut Class of 2013.\n\nMs Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman \u2013 with an expected total of 328 days in space.\n\nAlong with Ms Koch and Ms Meir, Nasa astronaut Andrew Morgan, Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr Skvortsov and Oleg Skripochka, and the European Space Agency\u2019s Luca Parmitano are part of the current ISS crew.\n\nNasa said in a statement that the BCDU failure has not impacted station operations, safety of the crew or ongoing experiments.\n\n\u201cThe station\u2019s overall power supply, which is fed by four sets of batteries and solar arrays, remains sufficient for all operations,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cHowever, the faulty power unit does prevent a set of batteries installed earlier this month from providing increased station power.\u201d", "description": "US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir are on course to make history as they venture outside the orbiting space lab.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/wire-19866338-1571363367-413_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
