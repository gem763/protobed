I\u2019ll let it stand on its own,\u201d Farrow began. \u201cBut the point here is not that we did indeed have multiple named women in every draft of this story, we did indeed have a taped confession from Harvey Weinstein, the point is that they ordered a hard stop to reporting. They told me and a producer working on this that we should not take a single call, they told us to cancel interviews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question, for years, has been why,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause every journalist at that institution didn\u2019t understand why. And I think the book answers that question. This was a company with a lot of secrets.\u201d\n\nRonan Farrow | ABC More\n\n(In a statement to PEOPLE, Lauer\u2019s attorney Elizabeth M. Locke says: \u201cIn 25 years at NBC, Matt Lauer did not have a single complaint brought to his attention until November 28, 2017. NBC has already stated this for the record after an internal investigation. I am sure NBC will have much to say about Ronan\u2019s claims.\u201d)\n\nFarrow went on to allege that there \u201cwas a chain of secret settlements\u201d at NBC News that were \u201ccovered up\u201d by the company long before Matt Lauer\u2018s own sexual misconduct allegations made headlines.\n\n\u201cWhat we show in this book, with a paper trail, with documents, is that there were multiple secret settlements and non-disclosures being struck with women at NBC News, years before \u2014 over period of six to seven years, a period in which NBC had previously denied any settlements \u2014 there were seven non-disclosure agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cMultiple ones of those were with Matt Lauer accusers. This is years before this incident with Brooke Nevils and the firing. And I spoke to senior executives who were told about those earlier incidents [with Matt Lauer].\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is indisputable, based on the evidence in this book, that there was a chain of secret settlements at this company that were covered up, with victims of harassment and assault. Some of them about Lauer, some about others in the company,\u201d Farrow added. \u201cThis was a pattern, it was concealed from journalists there. That\u2019s bigger than NBC, it\u2019s bigger than these executives.\u201d\n\n.@GMA EXCLUSIVE: @RonanFarrow sits down one-on-one with @GStephanopoulos to discuss allegations against Matt Lauer, his Harvey Weinstein investigation and NBC News' response to his reporting detailed in his new book \"Catch and Kill.\" https://t.co/W1vUNMab63 pic.twitter.com/CrfPeYvFyM \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 11, 2019\n\nRELATED: NBC Says Ronan Farrow\u2019s Claims It Quashed His Harvey Weinstein Story Are \u2018Fundamentally Untrue\u2019\n\nEarlier this week, Lack denied Farrows claims the network quashed his story in an internal memo to NBC staff, obtained by PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cAs you know, our news organization is filled with dedicated, professional journalists, including some of the best and most experienced investigative reporters, as well as others who support our reporting with exceptional talent, integrity and decency,\u201d Lack, 72, wrote on Wednesday. \u201cIt disappoints me to say that even with [the] passage of time, Farrow\u2019s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News. He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.\u201d", "description": "Ronan Farrow Speaks out After Bombshell Book Allegations", "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XirTgvfaMB.IFGxNqYDWpw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/18a1fc8a744b177c61a1aa372189b7d5", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
