There is no scandal with their marriage,\u2019 the source told The Mirror.\n\n\u2018Maybe to Coleen\u2019s camp, they were overshadowing them and becoming a bigger brand and that\u2019s why this has been so public.\u2019\n\nColeen Rooney accused Vardy of selling fake stories (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nThe insider added that Vardy has been left \u2018inconsolable\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She\u2019s crying her eyes out and is heavily pregnant. Coleen knew Becky and was friendly with her and she didn\u2019t know there were any issues,\u2019 they continued.\n\n\u2018Now she\u2019s getting relentlessly trolled and is just beside herself.\u2019\n\nRebekah and Jamie Vardy have been married for several years (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHowever, the Rooneys have hit back, with pals denying her claims are part of any plan or grudge.\n\n\u2018Coleen has never been interested in being a brand, that\u2019s nonsense,\u2019 the friend told The Mirror.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Coleen for comment.\n\nWAGs Coleen and Rebekah crossed paths at football matches when their husbands were playing (Picture: Rex)\n\nRooney made the accusations on Instagram, alleging that she set up a plot to expose her fellow WAG.\n\nColeen wrote: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.
