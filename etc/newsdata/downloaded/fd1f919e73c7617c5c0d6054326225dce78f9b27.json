It certainly looked like it anyway judging on last night so it\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d\n\nFrance midfielder Pogba has missed five of United\u2019s last seven matches with an ankle injury, and after spending part of the international break recuperating in Dubai, Solskjaer said the 26-year-old is still not ready for first-team action.\n\n\u201cPaul had an injury, he came back, he worked really hard. He came back and played a couple of games, maybe played through the pain barrier,\u201d Solskjaer added.\n\n\u201cHe had a scan after the Arsenal game and maybe needed a few weeks\u2019 rest in a boot so hopefully he won\u2019t be too long, but he won\u2019t make this game, no.\u201d\n\nUnited have recorded two wins in their opening eight league matches this season and sit two points above the relegation zone in 12th place.\n\nAnthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are likely to return from the treatment room but Solskjaer is yet to make a decision on their availability.\n\n\u201cHopefully, Aaron and Anthony will last the training this week and be available for selection,\u201d the Norwegian coach added.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s for half a game or 30 minutes I don\u2019t know but let\u2019s see where they\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nLiverpool have made a perfect start to the season with 24 points from eight matches and will look to equal Manchester City\u2019s record of 18 consecutive top-flight victories when they visit Old Trafford.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Manchester United will prepare for Sunday\u2019s Premier League clash against leaders Liverpool without the injured Paul Pogba and David De Gea, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pogba-de-gea-ruled-out-of-man-united-clash-with-liverpool_5da7a0f091a93.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
