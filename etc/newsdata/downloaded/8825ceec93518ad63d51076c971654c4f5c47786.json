While the initial response was flammable enough, the aftermath is swiftly growing beyond its original gaming context into a proper international incident.\n\nIf you want the skinny on how this whole thing got started, you can read the details here. Long story short, a Hearthstone player called Blitzchung spoke out in support of the protesters in Hong Kong, his hometown. Blizzard subsequently banned him from competing for a year, stripped him of his winnings in the tourney he was competing in, and broke with the casters who were interviewing him.\n\nFormer Blizzard games\u2019 fans have taken to Twitter with the hashtag #BoycottBlizzard to decry what they see as an infringement of Blitzchung\u2019s freedom of speech. Many are saying they\u2019ll abandon the companies games, which include Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and Starcraft, over the decision. You can see something similar happening over on the various Blizzard game-based subreddits. One of the most notable people to do this is Mark Kern, who worked as a team lead on vanilla World of Warcraft:\n\nThis hurts. But until Blizzard reverses their decision on @blitzchungHS I am giving up playing Classic WoW, which I helped make and helped convince Blizzard to relaunch. There will be no Mark of Kern guild after all. Let me explain why I am #BoycottBlizzard \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nReddit and Twitter users are also turning Mei, a Chinese character in Overwatch, into a nose-thumbing symbol for the Hong Kong protests via the medium of fanart.\n\nNow some of Blizzard\u2019s long-time affiliates are starting to talk back. This morning, Brian Kibler \u2014 a Hearthstone caster and streamer and a mainstay of the community \u2014 today revealed he won\u2019t be casting the finals of the Hearthstone Grandmasters game in which Blitzchung was participating. He said that while he understands Blizzard penalizing Blitzchung \u2014 he believes the intention was just to stop official streams from turning into political platforms \u2014 but said the penalty \u201cseems completely overboard to an extent that feels completely unwarranted and unfair.\u201d\n\nBlizzard employees are also jumping into the fray. According to former employee Kevin Hovdestad, the orc statue in front of the company\u2019s Irvine, California campus, which is etched with various company values, was used as a form of protest by current employees. Specifically, they covered up the plaques that read \u201cThink Globally\u201d and \u201cEvery Voice Matters.\u201d\n\nNot everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened. Both the \"Think Globally\" and \"Every Voice Matters\" values have been covered up by incensed employees this morning. pic.twitter.com/I7nAYUes6Q \u2014 Kevin Hovdestad (@lackofrealism) October 8, 2019\n\nWe reached out to Blizzard for comment on the situation and have received no response at time of writing.\n\nEpic Games spoke out (because of course it did), with CEO Tim Sweeney telling The Verge, \u201cEpic supports everyone\u2019s right to express their views on politics and human rights. We wouldn\u2019t ban or punish a Fortnite player or content creator for speaking on these topics.\u201d The primary reason he was speaking was likely because the same Chinese company that owns a stake in Epic, Tencent, also owns a stake in Activision Blizzard.\n\nAs for Chung Ng Wai, the player who started all this, he told AFP (via The Guardian): \u201cI don\u2019t regret saying that stuff. And even now, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d He said his concern over the protests made it difficult to focus on the competition, and hoped other gamers would follow his example. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect my comments would make a huge impact. I\u2019m just expressing myself and why should I be afraid of this kind of \u2018white terror\u2019? This is my freedom of speech. I shouldn\u2019t be scared. I hope my act can inspire other gamers like me, to continue to support the movement in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nWhile this started because of an esports player, it\u2019s swiftly evolving beyond the boundaries of the gaming world entirely. For proof, just see the number of American politicians who\u2019ve chimed in, despite knowing (I\u2019m gonna guess) next to nothing about Blitzchung\u2019s esports cred \u2014 and they don\u2019t need to. It\u2019s enough to know that someone is being dealt a harsh hand for speaking their mind on public channels by a company that seems to fear reprisal from the Chinese government. Senators Ron Wyden and Marco Rubio said as much on Twitter:\n\nBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck. https://t.co/rJBeXUiwYS \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 8, 2019\n\nRecognize what\u2019s happening here. People who don\u2019t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions. China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone. https://t.co/Cx3tkWc7r6 \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 8, 2019\n\nHowever you look at this, it\u2019s turning into something that\u2019s bigger than just a single Hearthstone tournament.\n\nBy the way, Blizzcon is less than a month away. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s going to be substantially more interesting this year than it usually is.\n\nRead next: Want to run more efficiently?
