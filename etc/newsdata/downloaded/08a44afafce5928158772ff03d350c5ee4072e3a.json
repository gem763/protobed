(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nAnother week, another loss for the Washington Redskins. The 24-3 drubbing at the hands of the New York Giants on Sunday dropped Washington\u2019s record to 0-4, its worst start to the season since 2001. A win in Week 5 against the New England Patriots is also unlikely, and it\u2019s been hard to find bright spots in a thus-far dismal season.\n\n[\u2018Coaching malpractice\u2019: Analysts rip Jay Gruden for playing Dwayne Haskins against Giants]\n\nYet there have been some standouts, starting with rookie wideout Terry McLaurin.\n\nMcLaurin, a third-round pick in April\u2019s draft, has been a revelation for the offense. The Ohio State product, who missed Sunday\u2019s loss with a hamstring injury, has caught 16 of 24 targets for 257 yards in three games. He is the only player in the Super Bowl era with five or more catches plus a touchdown in each of his first three games. McLaurin is also the deep threat this team has been missing for years, with his average target coming more than 15 yards past the line of scrimmage. That\u2019s double any other wideout on the roster, including speedster Paul Richardson Jr. (who has an average depth of target of 8.5 yards), and the 10th highest figure in the league this season.\n\nOverall, Washington\u2019s quarterbacks have a 141.8 passer rating when targeting McLaurin. The next-best passer rating on the team comes when quarterbacks target Richardson (86.4). The league average is 92.7.\n\nMcLaurin\u2019s absence on Sunday perhaps offered a partial excuse for Washington\u2019s season-low scoring output. It\u2019s not yet clear if McLaurin will be on the field on Sunday against the Patriots.\n\nHere are some other high-quality performers on what has so far been a bad team.\n\nBrandon Scherff, right guard\n\nOffensive linemen outside of the left tackle position tend to go unnoticed, but Scherff has quickly, and quietly, become one of the best guards in football. The 6-foot-5, 315-pound stalwart has earned two Pro Bowl nods in four seasons and is once again one of the highest-rated guards in the league, per the game charters at Pro Football Focus. According to their grading system, only Philadelphia\u2019s Brandon Brooks, Baltimore\u2019s Marshal Yanda and Pittsburgh\u2019s David DeCastro are having a better season at right guard than Scherff, who has allowed just one sack and three hurries over 195 snaps. Detroit\u2019s Graham Glasgow is the only right guard who has earned higher marks than Scherff for run blocking.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Scherff has been flagged for just two penalties this season, both during passing plays. Washington committed 12 penalties for 58 yards on Sunday against the Giants and has the second-most offensive holding penalties in 2019, behind only the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nScherff is also battling an injury, in his case an ankle sprain, which kept him out against the Giants, another possible explanation for the offensive struggles. Also, Scherff is in the final season of his rookie deal and has yet to agree to a contract extension.\n\nDaron Payne, nose tackle\n\nWashington\u2019s defense has been abysmal, but give Payne some credit for getting his job done. The second-year pro has five hits, five hurries, one knockdown and a batted pass on his ledger this season, and he has yet to miss a tackle. His eight defensive stops \u2014 a metric based on whether an opposing player is held to less than 40 percent of the yards needed to move the chains on first down, less than 50 percent of the yards needed on second down or is denied a first down or touchdown on any third or fourth down \u2014 are the highest on the team and tied for 10th most at the position. That\u2019s no small feat considering the Redskins are allowing opponents to convert a whopping 63 percent of third downs, the highest figure in the NFL and significantly higher than the league average (40 percent).\n\nDaron Payne making the key play on 3rd down. Having his way with the Cowboys LG so far. Should have had the sack himself, but Dak eludes him. Kerrigan chases it down from the back side. #Redskins get off the field pic.twitter.com/yRcYNkscnU \u2014 Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) September 15, 2019\n\nQuinton Dunbar, cornerback\n\nDunbar intercepted Giants quarterback Daniel Jones on consecutive throws in the second quarter Sunday, both targets to his No. 1 wideout, Sterling Shepard. He also prevented tight end Evan Engram from catching the only pass thrown his way when Dunbar was in coverage. The converted wide receiver has held opposing receivers to just 1.1 yards per snap in primary coverage this season, per Pro Football Focus, and opposing quarterbacks are managing a mere 29.9 passer rating when they test him in the secondary. For context, an incomplete pass earns a quarterback a 39.6 passer rating. Every other Redskins cornerback, including supposed star Josh Norman, has allowed a passer rating of 112.0 or higher this season.\n\nChris Thompson, running back\n\nThere are big personalities on the team at running back. Adrian Peterson is a future Hall of Famer and Derrius Guice, who has been out since Week 1, was a highly touted draft pick in 2018. Yet the little-noticed Thompson remains the most consistent performer of the group.\n\nThompson, in his seventh season with the Redskins, has rushed the ball 16 times for 46 yards and added 20 catches (out of 28 targets) for 251 yards, giving him 297 yards from scrimmage. Peterson is second among the running backs with 94 total yards.\n\nEight of Thompson\u2019s catches out of the backfield have resulted in a first down. Only Christian McCaffrey (13 on 25 catches) and Austin Ekeler (11 on 24 catches) turned catches into first downs more frequently among NFL running backs. And only Ekeler has produced more yards per route run at the position than Thompson.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAhead of Patriots game, Jay Gruden faces a familiar choice: Keenum, Haskins or McCoy?\n\nJay Gruden may be fired, but he may be the best man for this particularly awful job\n\nCase Keenum and Dwayne Haskins struggle, Redskins run game hits new low\n\nThe key moments from the Redskins\u2019 24-3 loss at New York\n\nThis wasn\u2019t about Jones vs. Haskins. It was about a well-run franchise vs. the Redskins.\n\nNFL power rankings, Week 5: Patriots and Chiefs, and then a jumbled mess", "description": "The Redskins are 0-4 for the first time since 2001, but not everyone on the team has been a disappointment.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post", "October At Am", "Neil Greenberg Is A Staff Writer With The Washington Post Whose Beat Is Sports Analytics.
