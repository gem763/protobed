The Angels have identified it as Morton\u2019s neuroma, which is a nerve issue affecting several of his toes. Trout has continually hoped to return to the field since he was first scratched \u2014 on Saturday he expressed optimism that he would be back on Sunday for good \u2014 but now we know that he won\u2019t be back until 2020.\n\nThe Angels aren\u2019t going to the playoffs, but this is still a major blow to the last few weeks of 2019 baseball. The sport is better when its best players are on the field, and Trout is the best of the best. He\u2019s hitting .291/.438/.645, and is at or near the top of every important offensive category in baseball. He\u2019s second in home runs (45), slugging percentage (.645) and OPS (1.083), and leads in on-base percentage (.438) and walks (110). He\u2019s likely to be the AL MVP, and missing the last few weeks of the season shouldn\u2019t change that.\n\nOAKLAND, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 04: Mike Trout #27 of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim looks on from the dugout prior to his game against the Oakland Athletics at Ring Central Coliseum on September 04, 2019 in Oakland, California.
