Headed in east west direction.\"\n\nMark Dignam said: \"Anyone else see the MASSIVE meteorite over Ireland just before 7:30pm? Incredibly bright for a couple of moments.\"\n\nAnd that wasn't the only sighting, the amazing sight was seen on at least two more occasions later in the night - first again at around 9pm.\n\nJohn Corr said: \"Just flew west to east across the North sky as seen from Cork. Was visible for about 30seconds. Broke up into a number of pieces and changed colours. Happened at about 21:05.\"\n\n(Image: Visual China Group via Getty Ima)\n\nPatrick Treacy tweeted a few moments after: \"Did anyone else see a large fireball in the sky over east Cork about 20 minutes ago?\"\n\nReports from social media suggest people in Mallow , Charleville, Cork City , Glanmire, Midleton, Watergrasshill and pretty much all areas of the county were able to see the phenomenon.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Cork that was amazed by the incredible sight - people in Galway, Donegal and other spots across the West coast all spotted the fireball.\n\nCllr Owen Hanley caught the lights on video over Galway City describing the incident as highly bizarre.", "description": "Some people said the mystery object looked like a 'fireball' - but it was actually a Chinese GPS satellite", "authors": ["Cormac O'Shea", "Image", "Pictures Provided Andreas Eriksson", "Visual China Group Via Getty Ima"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466442.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chinese-Rocket.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
