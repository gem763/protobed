Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nA few attendees laughed at the casually menacing remark, but the ballroom at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York stayed mostly silent.\n\nA person attending the event provided the Los Angeles Times with a recording of the president\u2019s remarks. The event was arranged so the president could thank the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, and her staff as he wound up four days of meetings around the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nTrump spoke just as Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, was defending the whistleblower at a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee, saying the individual \u201cdid the right thing\u201d and followed the law \u201cevery step of the way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, (D-Burbank), who heads the committee and led the questioning of Maguire, said later that Trump\u2019s crude comments in New York were intended to intimidate witnesses in the fast-moving impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThat kind of incitement to violence is only going to chill other witnesses when they come forward. And that is it\u2019s very intent, to intimidate the witnesses,\u201d Schiff said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the president is going to make [the inquiry] as difficult as possible, and do so in as dangerous and unethical a way as possible,\u201d he added.\n\nSchiff later issued a formal statement on the matter along with Rep. Eliot L. Engel, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, chairman of the Oversight Committee, warning the president to end such intimidation efforts.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is fully aware that our committees are seeking testimony from this whistleblower and others referenced in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint released today as part of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, and our nation\u2019s laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe president has often expressed nostalgia for the raw violence of bygone days, and his rhetoric has been cited by some who have resorted to physical violence.\n\nHis remarks Thursday drew harsh criticism from former national security officials, Democratic lawmakers and whistleblower advocates.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen not only this week, but throughout the history of this nation, whistleblowers are vital to protecting democracy, the rule of law, and our Constitution,\u201d said Louis Clark, executive director of the Government Accountability Project, a nonpartisan group. \u201cWhistleblowers should be celebrated and protected, not targeted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president brought up the whistleblower almost as soon as he began his remarks on a podium in front of a blue backdrop in the low-ceilinged ballroom, again claiming that his phone call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nThe White House released its account of the call on Wednesday, and it largely corroborates the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. After Zelensky asked to buy U.S. anti-tank missiles to help fight Russian-backed separatists, Trump responded by asking for \u201ca favor,\u201d including help investigating Joe Biden, the former vice president who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump cited his awkward meeting with Zelensky on Wednesday where both leaders were asked about the implicit quid pro quo detailed in the call summary and whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Was he pressuring you?\u2019\u201d Trump said, describing the question to Zelensky, who responded that he hadn\u2019t felt any \u201cpush,\u201d but also said he didn\u2019t want to get involved in a U.S. political squabble.\n\n\u201cYou know, these animals in the press,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cThey\u2019re animals, some of the worst human beings you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d\n\nSomeone in the room shouted out \u201cFake news!\u201d egging the president on.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re scum,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cMany of them are scum, and then you have some good reporters, but not many of them, I\u2019ll be honest with you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then accused Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.), who met with Zelensky in Kyiv this month, of pressuring the Ukrainian leader to accuse Trump of improper behavior.\n\n\u201cDemocratic senators went over there and strong-armed the guy,\u201d Trump said, affecting Murphy\u2019s voice for a moment. \u201c\u2018You better damn well do this or you\u2019re not going to get any money from Congress.\u2019 Oh, I see, that\u2019s OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you have Sleepy Joe Biden, who\u2019s dumb as a rock,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cThis guy was dumb on his best day and he\u2019s not having his best day right now. He\u2019s dumb as a rock. So you have Sleepy Joe and his kid, who\u2019s got a lot of problems, he got thrown out of the Navy \u2014 look, I\u2019m not going to, it\u2019s a problem ... so we won\u2019t get into why. He got thrown out of the Navy and now this kid goes into Ukraine, walks away with millions of dollars, he becomes a consultant for $50,000 a month and he doesn\u2019t know anything compared to anybody at this firm. He\u2019s a stiff. He knows nothing. He\u2019s walking away with $50,000.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden was discharged from the Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine. From 2014 to 2019, he served on the board of Burisma Holdings, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.\n\nTrump, as he continued to speak, expressed further dismay that he is the one being investigated, not Biden.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re talking about me and I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said, hedging slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the most innocent person in the world.\u201d", "description": "President Trump slammed the whistleblower who first warned that the president was trying to strong-arm a foreign leader for personal gain as \"a spy,\" and suggested he or she had committed treason.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Eli Stokols Is A White House Reporter Based In The Los Angeles Times", "Washington", "D.C."], "top_image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4434937/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5269x2766+0+373/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fca-times.brightspotcdn.com%2F2d%2F6e%2F3b93239e4ee8845ae181e4bc8ec5%2Ftrump-39365.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
