Elizabeth Warren engage in a \"Battle of the Taxes.\" The liberal New Englanders have laid out progressive proposals and in recent weeks they have unveiled dueling tax plans that target the nation's most wealthy citizens in their competition to win voters with promises of a more equitable economy.\n\nWarren rolled out a plan she described as \"the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal\" earlier this month.\n\nHer far-reaching plan encompasses unions, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage and rights for domestic workers.\n\nSander's new plan touches on the proposed federal minimum wage increase too, but focuses on employee ownership. If workers had ownership stakes in their companies and an equal say on corporate boards, CEO-worker pay disparity would decrease, he claims.\n\n\"Study after study has shown that employee ownership increases employment, increases productivity, increases sales, and increases wages in the United States,\" the plan reads. \"This is in large part because employee-owned businesses boost employee morale, dedication, creativity and productivity, because workers share in profits and have more control over their own work lives.\"\n\nIn addition, Sanders' plan:\n\nRequires that 45 percent of the board of directors of certain corporations (like those with at least $100 million in annual revenue) be directly elected by the firm's workers.\n\nRepeals a Securities and Exchange Commission rule so that large-scale corporate stock buybacks are treated as stock manipulation.\n\nMandates all publicly traded companies provide at least 2 percent of stock to workers every year until the company is at least 20 percent employee-owned.\n\nReview and possibly undo all mergers that have taken place during the Trump administration.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe plan's release comes ahead of the Democratic debate on Tuesday.", "description": "If workers had ownership stakes in their companies and an equal say on corporate boards, CEO-worker\u00a0pay disparity would decrease, Sanders claims.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/AP18051785664526.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
