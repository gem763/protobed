And he predicted victory in his trade war with China, saying his tariff-heavy approach will bring the Asian superpower to its knees.\n\n\u201cTheir supply chains are being broken like toys,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pledged to build his border wall and to protect people with preexisting conditions, should the GOP manage to rally from its 2017 failure to replace Obamacare. And he pledged to protect the Second Amendment at all cost as Congress debates how to thwart mass shootings.\n\nTesting a new applause line, he said it might be tough for the GOP to push its narrative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Democrats and it\u2019s the media, we\u2019re fighting two battles. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re one, because they are one. They\u2019re colluding and they\u2019re obstructing,\u201d he said to laughter.\n\nMr. Trump delivered his pep talk close to a year after the House Republicans lost the majority in midterm elections.\n\nThey took consolation this week in winning a tightly contested House special election in North Carolina.\n\nRepublican Dan Bishop squeaked to victory, exposing Democrats\u2019 weakness in rural areas but \u2014 perhaps more importantly for 2020 \u2014 revealing eroded support for Republicans in the suburbs.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged the tough fight.\n\n\u201cHe got in gear and he was brutal and brilliant and he did a great job,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bishop. \u201cWe worked together as a team and it was inspirational for a lot of people to watch.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy insisted the party is well-positioned to retake the House and pursue an agenda based on core party values, starting with attempts to reel in entitlement programs that are driving the runaway debt.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have never been more united,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cLook at the polling itself with this president. No president, not even Ronald Reagan, had as much support within the party as President Trump does.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Trump is worried about electoral prospects, he didn\u2019t let on.\n\n\u201cWinning is a good thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mr. Trump said as he took the stage to chants of \u201cfour more years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna take it. You\u2019re gonna take the majority,\u201d he added later.\n\nThe president\u2019s visit to Baltimore comes a month after he sparked outrage for describing the city as a \u201cdisgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess.\u201d He accused Democrats of mismanaging the city.\n\nAs Democrats pushed back against the president\u2019s comments, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was born in Baltimore, slammed Mr. Trump, suggesting his \u201cslumlord\u201d son-in-law Jared Kushner, who owns property in the city, was partly responsible.\n\nMr. McCarthy defended Mr. Trump, saying the visit put a spotlight on the war on poverty.\n\n\u201cI think the president coming here symbolizes that yes, he cares about Baltimore,\u201d the California Republican said Thursday. \u201cHe cares about the people of Baltimore and he does not accept that you have to stay in poverty.\u201d\n\nSome locals doubted his sympathies, however. As Mr. Trump\u2019s motorcade approached the GOP\u2019s hotel, bystanders near the Inner Harbor booed, held signs about rats and at least one young woman offered a dual-middle finger salute.\n\nMr. Trump was scheduled to speak at 7:10 p.m. but didn\u2019t start until 8 p.m. or so \u2014 right as 10 of his potential 2020 Democratic foes took the primary-debate stage in Houston.\n\nThe president said he could run them off the stage by pointing to low unemployment rates, particularly among black and Hispanic Americans.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Mr. Trump rued the fact he\u2019d miss the Democratic mud-slinging.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to have it somehow taped,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he left the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting. I look forward to going home, I\u2019m going to have to watch it as a rerun.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also handicapped the primary.\n\n\u201cIt would look to me like it would be Elizabeth Warren, and looks like Joe [Biden], maybe will be able to get there \u2014 maybe not. I don\u2019t know. Certainly Bernie [Sanders] is there,\u201d he said. \u201cI would imagine Biden would be able to make it if he doesn\u2019t make any major mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, it takes a lot of courage to run for office,\u201d he added. \u201cI respect all of them.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
