(Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images)\n\nOn Sunday, 20 MLB teams will play their final game of the 2019 season.\n\nBy Monday, half of those teams could be looking for a new manager.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat\u2019s how much turnover is possible in the managerial ranks.\n\nSome teams have already made the decision to go in another direction. Others are weighing their options. And others still are rumored to be basing their decisions on who becomes available.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to keep track of. So we\u2019ve decided to break things down a bit to let you know who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out and which teams might be hours away from beginning the search to hire a new manager.\n\nCould be out\n\nJoe Maddon, Chicago Cubs\n\nIt was announced that Maddon and team president Theo Epstein will meet following Saturday\u2019s game in St. Louis and a decision on his future could be made in the next 24 hours. Maddon led the Cubs to the postseason in each of his first four seasons in Chicago, including bringing the franchise its first World Series title in 108 years back in 2016. However, the team\u2019s collapse in September has led many to believe the Cubs will go in a new direction.\n\nMaddon\u2019s contract with the Cubs is set to expire following the World Series. If he becomes available, he would immediately become a candidate for the San Diego Padres and possibly the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nMickey Callaway, New York Mets\n\nCallaway\u2019s days appeared to numbered in May. Then the Mets rebounded and nearly pushed for a postseason spot. In the end, they settled back to being more discombobulated than an actual contender. Given the disappointing conclusion, general manager Brodie Van Wagenen might be anxious to hire his first manager.\n\nClint Hurdle, Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the terrible results on the field and the turmoil that's surfaced off the field in Pittsburgh, it seemed more likely than not that Clint Hurdle would be fired. Not so fast. This last week has produced conflicting reports about Hurdle\u2019s status for 2020. That latest word from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\u2019s Jason Mackey is that a final decision has not been made. Hurdle still has two years remaining on his contract, which could end up factoring into the decision.\n\nBrad Ausmus, Los Angeles Angels\n\nAusmus\u2019 future might be tied to another manager on this list. If Joe Maddon becomes available and the Angels think they have a chance to hire him, it\u2019s likely Ausmus will be let go after just one season. Granted, it was a disappointing season that saw the Angels finish fourth in the AL West. But that alone wouldn\u2019t typically be grounds for dismissal.\n\nGabe Kapler, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nKapler was on the hot seat coming into the 2019 season. Then the Phillies went out and not only missed the postseason, but flirted with a losing record despite adding Bryce Harper, J.T. Realmuto and Jean Segura to the lineup. If the Phillies keep him, Kapler could be the first manager to go in 2020 if Philadelphia starts slow.\n\nScott Servais, Seattle Mariners\n\nSeattle started the season 13-3. Then the wheels fell off. Since that point, the Mariners are 54-90. That could spell doom for Servais. Though with the Mariners now committed to rebuilding, it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll stick with him for one more season.\n\nOctober Hot Seat\n\nDave Roberts, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nThere\u2019s only really one name on the list because it\u2019s a pretty unique situation. The Los Angeles Dodgers, if saddled with another October disappointment, could decide to move on from Dave Roberts. Some fans have been calling for his job since last year\u2019s World Series loss \u2014 the Dodgers\u2019 second in a row. The Dodgers were slow to reassure Roberts of his job after last season, but then did sign him to a four-year extension before the season started. That would make Roberts seem safe, but crazier things have happened.\n\nCould have been fired, but now appear safe\n\nDon Mattingly, Miami Marlins\n\nDerek Jeter and company are always keeping us on our toes. With the Marlins starting to advance in their rebuilding plan, and with Don Mattingly's contract set to expire at season's end, it seemed now would be a logical time for Miami to change directions at the manager position. Instead, the team signed Mattingly to a two-year extension that will keep him involved during a critical phase in the rebuild.\n\nRick Renteria, Chicago White Sox\n\nThe White Sox haven\u2019t done much under Renteria, winning 67, 62 and 71 games during his three-year run. A lot of that was by design with the franchise committed to rebuilding, but there were heightened expectations in 2019 that clearly weren\u2019t met. That seemingly opened the door for a change, but general manager Rick Hahn has already confirmed Renteria will return in 2020 to oversee the \u201cnext phase.\u201d\n\nRon Gardenhire, Detroit Tigers\n\nAt 46-113, the Tigers have already wrapped up the worst record in MLB. In many cases, that would be grounds for firing the manager. But the Tigers know they have bigger problems. As such, MLB Network\u2019s Jon Heyman is reporting that Ron Gardenhire\u2019s job is safe and he will return for the final year of his contract in 2020.\n\nSan Francisco manager Bruce Bochy is heading into retirement. (Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images)\n\nAlready out\n\nBruce Bochy, San Francisco Giants\n\nBochy took the drama out of this situation in spring training when he announced his intentions to retire after 25 years of managing, the last 13 of which were spent in San Francisco. The future Hall of Famer entered his final weekend with a 1,052-1,052 record and three World Series titles with the Giants. For his career, Bochy has won 2,003 games.\n\nNed Yost, Kansas City Royals\n\nBruce Bochy isn\u2019t the only World Series winner slated to manage his final game on Sunday. Ned Yost, who oversaw the Royals\u2019 championship team in 2015, will walk away after 16 seasons in the dugout for Kansas City and the Milwaukee Brewers. The respected skipper enters his final game with a 1,202-1,340 career record.\n\nAndy Green, San Diego Padres\n\nThe Padres didn't wait around to determine Andy Green's fate. The fourth-year manager was relieved of his duties on Sept. 21, leaving bench coach Rod Barajas to serve as interim manager for the remainder of the season. Green's fate was sealed when the Padres failed to take a notable step forward following the offseason signing of Manny Machado. With Machado, Eric Hosmer and rookies Fernando Tatis Jr. and Chris Paddack forming a strong core, the Padres job might be the most attractive managerial opening in MLB.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "What will be the fate of MLB managers Joe Maddon, Mickey Callaway and Dave Roberts?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qfafTnmfGuA4UMDudsjaXw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hTFQsD9pLFfatbKP3OgV4Q--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7a504ab0-e1ea-11e9-adbd-3248e2eb9bf8", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
