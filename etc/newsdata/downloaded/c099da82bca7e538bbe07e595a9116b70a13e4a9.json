Subsequent months have seen the violent behaviour continue, but Gray promised to get a handle on the situation when Chantelle announced that she was pregnant.\n\nThe solicitor promised to attend therapy for his anger issues and Chantelle was delighted as a result. However, her positive outlook could well be short-lived, as problems persist in the coming episodes.\n\nChantelle is overjoyed when Denise (Diane Parish) asks her to cover a shift at the salon. The young woman takes delight in being back at work \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that she keeps this information from Gray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a girl steals from Whitney\u2019s (Shona McGarty) stall, and Gray sets off to apprehend her. As a result, he ends up passing by the salon, where he sees Chantelle hard at work \u2014 much to his dismay.\n\nChantelle later arrives at The Queen Vic, but she\u2019s shocked to see everyone there. However, the reason soon becomes apparent, as Gray announces their news to them all.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty evident that his motivations for doing so stem from the anger he feels over the fact that Chantelle lied.\n\nHow will Chantelle react?\n\nOne to watch: Monday 21st October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will he resort to violence once more?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18854747-high-e74f_1570610650.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
