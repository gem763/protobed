An unusual Charlottesville Bible study makes the case.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nThe Rev. Isaac Collins leads a group gathered at the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Va. Collins, lead pastor at Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church, is one of two Methodist pastors who have been leading a Bible study course based around Charlottesville\u2019s Confederate monuments for the past month. (Phil Woodson/Phil Woodson)\n\nCharlottesville\u2019s Confederate monuments played many roles in recent years: the epicenter of a legal and cultural battle over what should count as cherished history, the rallying spot for murderous white supremacists, the touchstone of a painful national reckoning with America\u2019s slave-owning past.\n\nNow, they\u2019re fodder for a Bible study.\n\nTwo Methodist pastors selected the monuments as the sites and subjects of their ongoing class, \u201cSwords into Plowshares: What the Bible says about injustice, idolatry, and repentance.\u201d Over the past month, the pastors \u2014 the Rev. Isaac Collins of Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church and the Rev. Phil Woodson of First United Methodist Church, both in Charlottesville \u2014 have led weekly seminars that reinterpret the statues as idols meant to prop up the false religion of white supremacy.\n\n\u201cIf you read the installation ceremonies, when they were put up, God is regularly invoked, there\u2019s religious vocabulary used about them, they\u2019re supposed to instill awe or reverence,\u201d Collins said in an interview. \u201cSo we\u2019re specifically trying to take the Bible\u2019s language around idolatry and make the case that these statues are idols to white supremacy.\u201d\n\nThe two pastors pair each statue with a quotation from Scripture before gathering students beneath the monument and leading an hour-long class that includes equal doses of theology and history. The seminars are free \u2014 both pastors are teaching without pay \u2014 and open to all.\n\n[An unsung hero of the 9/11 recovery: The Muslim engineer who rebuilt the Pentagon crash site as a chapel]\n\nA recent lecture revolved around the statue of Confederate general Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson. Collins and Woodson handed attendees a pamphlet that outlined the statue\u2019s path to installation and quoted from Exodus 32, which details God\u2019s anger over the Israelites\u2019 worship of a golden calf.\n\n\u201cThen the Lord said to Moses, \u2018Go down, because your people ... have become corrupt,\u2019 \u201d the text reads in part. \u201cThey have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of the calf.\u201d\n\nCollins said the decision to analyze this passage in conjunction with the Jackson statue was \u201can absolute no-brainer\u201d: The monument is easily seen as an idol akin to the calf. Jordan Leahy, a Charlottesville resident who has attended all but one of the classes, said that he had never thought of the monuments in religious terms before but that he finds the pastors\u2019 arguments convincing.\n\n\u201cYou come to a very concrete realization that, if you take a Christian angle on it, they are certainly idolatrous,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cThey have no artistic value or public beauty. ... These statues, when you study it, it\u2019s clear they cannot be a part of our faith or our town.\u201d\n\nSome in Charlottesville disagree. The city is facing an ongoing, heated legal fight over its plans to remove statues of Jackson and Confederate general Robert E. Lee. On Wednesday, a judge dealt a blow to the anti-monument camp when he ruled that it is illegal for municipalities to remove such monuments to war.\n\n[Jarrid Wilson, a megachurch pastor known widely for his mental health advocacy, dies by suicide]\n\nCollins said his and Woodson\u2019s Bible study, which will hold its last meeting this weekend, follows the Methodist tradition of \u201cgoing out into public spaces to practice faith in a contextual way.\u201d He pointed to John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodism, who often preached outside \u2014 most famously, near coal mines \u2014 in a bid to reach people where they were.\n\nHistorians of religion agreed that the seminar, which they said is likely the first to argue Confederate symbols are religious idols, is uniquely Methodist in its outdoors setting. Christopher Evans, a professor of the history of Christianity at Boston University, said the study also recalls a long-standing Methodist habit of exploring theology through contemporary issues (for example, Wesley once set hymns to the tune of pub songs).\n\nBut it also breaks with more conservative strains of U.S. Methodism and could spur a backlash, Evans said. The United Methodist Church, though it has adopted anti-slavery and anti-racism views, has yet to take any kind of formal stance on Confederate monuments, according to Kurt Adams, the communications director for the General Board of Church and Society, the church\u2019s public policy and advocacy arm.\n\nTed A. Campbell, a professor of church history at Southern Methodist University, said he suspects \u201ca lot of Methodists,\u201d especially those in the Southern part of the country, believe it is acceptable \u2014 perhaps even necessary \u2014 to honor Confederate leaders.\n\n\u201cWhat these pastors are doing is very brave in that sense,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very sensitive issue \u2014 and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re in the North, looking at this from afar. They\u2019re within a Southern church and community.\u201d\n\nStill, Collins and Woodson said, they\u2019ve drawn no protesters during the five classes held to date. At worst, the pastors received a few negative emails and comments on Facebook \u2014 stuff that\u2019s \u201ceasy to ignore,\u201d Collins said.\n\nCollins and Woodson came up with the idea for the seminar during informal conversations the two (who\u2019ve been good friends for several years) began having early this summer. Both pastors believe the Confederate statues should be removed, and they saw their Bible study as a way to spread that belief \u2014 backed up by Bible-based reasoning \u2014 among the residents of Charlottesville.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that the people who regularly attended ... gained a better understanding of why these statues are in direct conflict with the will and desire of God and why God\u2019s people are called to remove them completely,\u201d Woodson said.\n\n[Trump accidentally tweeted an insult at a pastor. Here\u2019s how the pastor responded.]\n\nThe seminars, which took place at 7 a.m. on Sunday mornings, kicked off in early August, a debut timed to coincide with the anniversary of the 2017 Unite the Right rally that left one woman dead and dozens injured, according to Collins.\n\nClasses typically drew about three dozen participants, including some of the two men\u2019s congregants. But attendees also included people of all ages, races and religious denominations, as well as non-religious people, Collins said. University of Virginia professors and local politicians showed up, he added \u2014 and, once or twice, passing joggers stopped to join in.\n\nThat was exactly what Collins and Woodson hoped would happen: They wanted to make the seminar accessible to a wide range of people. The two pastors tried \u201cto keep it as ecumenical and interfaith as possible,\u201d Collins said. They spread the word about the series through their churches, through social media and through word of mouth.\n\nEach class proceeded the same way: First, Collins and Woodson distributed pamphlets. Then, the two took turns speaking for about half an hour, lecturing on the history of the monument and its ties to the week\u2019s chosen Bible passage.\n\nAfter that, students broke into small groups to discuss what they had heard and read, chatting together for about 10 minutes. Everyone reconvened to reflect on their findings, sharing for about 15 minutes before the pastors led everyone in song and the group broke up.\n\nBoth Collins and Woodson said they believe the program has been a huge success and that they\u2019d like to do it again, perhaps this coming spring. In the meantime, Collins is optimistic that others may follow in their footsteps.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough spaces where these kinds of discussions can be held in an honest way,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully this will inspire other people to think more deeply about what role these statues play in our community.\u201d\n\nSally Hudson, a University of Virginia professor who lives in Charlottesville and worships at Woodson\u2019s church and attended most of the classes, said the study demonstrated the very best \u201cspirit of Methodist Christianity.\u201d For Hudson, who grew up in a tradition of \u201cfaith-based organizing,\u201d the seminar underscored the role that communities of faith must play in working to achieve racial justice, she said.\n\nBut what will stick with her most powerfully, Hudson said, is a prayer from the United Methodist hymnal that Collins, Woodson and attendees recited together at the end of every class. Hudson pulled up the text on her phone and read it aloud:\n\nLet me not be afraid to defend the weak because of the anger of the strong\n\nNor afraid to defend the poor because of the anger of the rich.\n\n\u201cAnd to do it in the presence of these statues \u2014 staring up at them, feeling the full weight ...\u201d she said. \u201cIf there ever were a prophetic call for our time, that\u2019s it.\u201d", "description": "Two Methodist pastors selected the monuments as the sites and subjects of their class \u201cSwords into Plowshares: What the Bible says about injustice, idolatry, and repentance.\u201d", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
