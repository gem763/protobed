Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWhat is hepatitis?\n\nHepatitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the liver, the NHS states.\n\nHepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances, and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.\n\nThere are several different types of hepatitis and while some will pass without any serious problems, others can be long-lasting and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), loss of liver function and, in some cases, liver cancer.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hepatitis?\n\nShort-term hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so many people do not realise they have it. However, if symptoms do develop, the NHS states they can include:\n\nmuscle and joint pain\n\na high temperature\n\nfeeling and being sick\n\nfeeling unusually tired all the time\n\na general sense of feeling unwell\n\nloss of appetite\n\ntummy pain\n\ndark urine\n\npale, grey-coloured faeces\n\nitchy skin\n\nyellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)\n\nThe NHS adds that long-term hepatitis also may not have any obvious symptoms until the liver stops working properly and may only be picked up during blood tests.\n\nIn the later stages it can cause jaundice, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, confusion, and blood in stools or vomit.\n\nWhat are the different types hepatitis?\n\nThere are a number of different types of hepatitis including A, B, C, D, E, alcoholic and autoimmune.\n\nMore information on the different types is outlined below.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThe NHS states that hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus.\n\nIt is typically caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the faeces of an infected person, and is most common in countries where sanitation is poor.\n\nHepatitis A usually passes within a few months, although it can occasionally be severe and even life threatening.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for it, other than to relieve symptoms like pain, nausea and itching.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is spread in the blood of an infected person, the NHS states.\n\nIt is a common infection worldwide and is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact.\n\nIn rare cases, it can be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs.\n\nMost adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months.\n\nBut most people infected as children develop a long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medication can be used to treat it.\n\nHepatitis C\n\nHepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus and is the most common type of viral hepatitis in the UK, the NHS states.\n\nIt is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.\n\nIn the UK, it is most commonly spread through sharing needles used to inject drugs.\n\nPoor healthcare practices and unsafe medical injections are the main way it is spread outside the UK.\n\nHepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or only flu-like symptoms, so many people are unaware they're infected.\n\nAround 1 in 4 people will fight off the infection and be free of the virus. In the remaining cases, it'll stay in the body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis C and can cause cirrhosis and liver failure.\n\nChronic hepatitis C can be treated with very effective antiviral medications, but there's currently no vaccine available.\n\nHepatitis D\n\nHepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus. It only affects people who are already infected with hepatitis B, as it needs the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body.\n\nHepatitis D is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact or sexual contact, the NHS states.\n\nLong-term infection with hepatitis D and hepatitis B can increase the risk of developing serious problems, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\nThere is no vaccine specifically for hepatitis D, but the hepatitis B vaccine can help protect people from it.\n\nHepatitis E\n\nThe NHS states that hepatitis E is caused by the hepatitis E virus. The number of cases in Europe has increased in recent years and it is now the most common cause of short-term hepatitis in the UK.\n\nThe virus has been mainly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat or offal, but also with wild boar meat, venison and shellfish.\n\nHepatitis E is generally a mild and short-term infection that does not require any treatment, but it can be serious in some people, such as those who have a weakened immune system.\n\nAlcoholic hepatitis\n\nAlcoholic hepatitis is a type of hepatitis caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years, the NHS states.\n\nThe condition is common in the UK and many people do not realise they have it.\n\nThis is because it does not usually cause any symptoms, although it can cause sudden jaundice and liver failure in some people.\n\nStopping drinking will usually allow the liver to recover, but there is a risk of eventually developing cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer if a person continues to drink alcohol excessively.\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis is a rare cause of long-term hepatitis in which the immune system attacks and damages the liver, the NHS states.\n\nEventually, the liver can become so damaged that it stops working properly.\n\nTreatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves very effective medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation.\n\nIt is not clear what causes autoimmune hepatitis and it is not known whether anything can be done to prevent it.\n\nFor more information about hepatitis and access to a confidential hepatitis helpline, visit The Hepatitis Trust website here.", "description": "On Friday 13 September, Public Health England released a report stating that up to 95,600 people in the UK could be unaware that they are infected with hepatitis C.
