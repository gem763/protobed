REUTERS/Carlos Osorio/File Photo\n\nScheer\u2019s carefully cultivated everyman persona contrasts with his more charismatic opponent, whose star has faded after four years in government. Just since August, Trudeau has been embroiled in a blackface scandal and condemned by Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog.\n\nThat has given the normally mild-mannered Scheer reason to go on the attack. In an election debate on Monday, Scheer attacked Trudeau as a blackface-wearing \u201cphony\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d who does not deserve to govern, drawing gasps from the live audience.\n\nWith an untested leader at their helm, the Conservatives are counting on public fatigue with Trudeau to propel them to victory in a race that opinion polls show as virtually tied. Scheer was elected Conservative leader in 2017.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s motivating Conservative voters is a dislike for Justin Trudeau, a real desire to see him defeated,\u201d said pollster David Coletto, chief executive of Abacus Data.\n\nScheer, a 40-year-old father of five, says his vision for Canada\u2019s future is fiscal prudence and free markets, plus backing for the struggling oil industry and a little help to households for cost-of-living increases.\n\nHis first act in government, he says, will be to cancel Trudeau\u2019s national carbon pricing scheme - a federal tax on fossil fuels that is intended to bring down carbon emissions, most of which is later refunded as a rebate.\n\nScheer has also vowed to balance the budget within five years, although unlike the Liberals and others, he has yet to release the full cost of his campaign promises.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the debate is always more government or less government,\u201d Scheer told Reuters in a recent interview, saying his view was that the free market \u201chas done untold good\u201d throughout history.\n\nBut he has struggled under the spotlight at times, looking stiff behind the podium, and has seen his oft-used refrain that Trudeau, 47, is \u201cnot as advertised\u201d turned against him when it was disclosed he holds dual Canadian-U.S. citizenship, which he is in the process of giving up.\n\nScheer, who along with others in his party, has criticized politicians in the past for holding dual citizenship, told reporters he had not disclosed it because \u201cno one\u2019s ever asked me.\u201d\n\nAsked why he had kept it to himself for so long, Scheer said in the interview: \u201cThe first time a reporter ever said: \u2018Is he a dual citizen?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nScheer has also been taken to task repeatedly for his anti-abortion position - although he insists he has no plans to roll back women\u2019s rights in Canada - for a 2005 anti-same sex marriage speech and for his refusal to take part in gay-pride marches.\n\n\u2018DAILY STRUGGLES\u2019\n\nIn less than two weeks, Canada\u2019s famously progressive Trudeau government could be dislodged by a social and fiscal conservative who spent little time in the working world before first being elected to parliament at age 25.\n\nFour years ago, \u201cchange\u201d was the overriding theme of the election for Trudeau after almost a decade of Conservative rule. While there is no single theme this year, Scheer is capitalizing on the sense that Trudeau has not delivered that change.\n\n\u201cThis election is more about not voting the Liberal Party because honestly, I don\u2019t really like what they did in the past four years,\u201d first-time voter Vlad Gnatenko, 21, said at a Scheer rally outside Toronto.\n\nIn 2015, Conservatives argued that Trudeau lacked the experience to be prime minister, but the party has thrown its full weight behind Scheer, who has even less experience than Trudeau did.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau doesn\u2019t get the daily struggles that we go through,\u201d said Ted Hurley, a Conservative volunteer, at a small barbecue rally in Ottawa last month. \u201cYou can tell he\u2019s a family man ... who has driven a minivan and understands what families are going through.\u201d\n\nWhile the blackface scandal initially hurt Trudeau in the polls, the effect has since worn off. Now the Liberals appear to have a slight advantage in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which have more parliamentary seats than the Western prairies where Scheer dominates.\n\nTrudeau also has history on his side.\n\nNot since 1935 has a Canadian prime minister who won a parliamentary majority in his first term been booted from office in the next election.\n\nIn response to Scheer\u2019s balanced budget pledge, Trudeau has responded that it will lead cuts to services and will hurt households.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cut your way to prosperity,\u201d he says.", "description": "Canadian Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who has a chance of defeating Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Oct. 21 election, is running as a fiscally prudent, minivan-driving dad whom Canadians can count on to rescue the country from the tax-and-spend Liberal leader.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438980811&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981YO-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
