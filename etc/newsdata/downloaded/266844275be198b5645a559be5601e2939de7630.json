Econoday shows consensus estimates for September employment slightly lower at 145,000.\n\nThe data hold particular significance after reports about American factory activity showed evidence of contraction in September , with the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing report on Tuesday showing the weakest reading in about a decade and an ISM non-manufacturing report on Thursday, coming in at 52.6% \u2014 the weakest level in about three years.\n\nThe survey reports have underscored the damage caused by President Trump\u2019s trade war with China. The spat has raised the cost of supplies, disrupted supply chains and hurt exports.\n\nOn top of that, private-sector data from Automatic Data Processing Inc. on Wednesday estimating that the American private sector created 135,000 for the month was weaker-than expected, raising red flags that a U.S. recession may be possible.\n\nMarket reaction to the jobs number, however, is difficult to predict, as good numbers may suggest the U.S. central bank will be less inclined to trim borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cIf jobs numbers meet or beat expectations, it will be welcome news for the US economy but will undermine the case for more aggressive easing from the Fed,\u201d wrote Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.\n\nFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida late Thursday played down the chances of a near-term recession. He said the risk remains low \u201cwith appropriate monetary policy,\u201d speaking at a question-and-answer session sponsored by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nClarida offered no explicit forward guidance about whether the Fed would cut rates again at its meeting on Oct. 29-30.\n\n\u201cWe think poor US economic data poses downside risk to stocks and the dollar while the Fed maintains the current modest stance on easing policy,\u201d Lawler said.\n\nHowever, the market is pricing in a greater than 90% chance that the Fed cuts interest rates later this month by 25 basis points, which would represent the third cut in as many policy meetings, according to CME Group data based on federal-funds futures.\n\nThe jobs report is set to be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, with data on international trade also coming at that same time.\n\nA parade of other Fed speakers are set, headlined by a 2 p.m. talk from Powell, where he will deliver opening remarks about employment and price stability at a Fed hosted event.\n\nBefore that, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren will appear at 8:30 a.m. at an event in his home region, Atlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic will speak at 10:25 a.m. in New Orleans, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will talk at 12:45 p.m. at an event in his district. Capping off the Friday appearances are Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, who will moderate a panel at 2:10 p.m., and Fed Vice-Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, who moderates a panel at 4 p.m.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nShares of Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.85% rose 1.6% in premarket trade after a report in the Nikkei Asian Review that the company has asked suppliers to ramp up production of its latest iPhone 11 model by 10%, or 8 million units.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. COST, +1.36% reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close Thursday, with earnings and revenue falling short of Wall Street estimates, though same-store sales growth of 5.1% matched expectations.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.56% rose less than a basis point to 1.535%.\n\nGold prices edged lower after settling higher on Thursday. Gold for December delivery GCZ19, -0.03% picked about 60 cents to $1,513.30 an ounce on Comex.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery CLX19, +0.55% rose 27 cents, to $52.73 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nIn Asia overnight Wednesday, the Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng HSI, -1.11% was down 1.1% as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam banned protesters from wearing masks in a hardening of the government\u2019s stance on the territory\u2019s most disruptive crisis since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. The mask ban takes effect Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, +0.32% meanwhile, gained 0.3% after a 2% fall on Thursday. European stocks traded mixed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.12% up 0.1%.", "description": "U.S. stock-index futures on Friday drifted lower ahead of a monthly on U.S. employment that could help to provide the clearest picture yet of the health of a...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre", "Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM675_adp_lo_ZG_20190703072059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
