That she got such a critical job demonstrated Morgan Stanley\u2019s confidence in Ms. La Roche, Mr. Wadsworth said.\n\nIn a two-decade career at Morgan Stanley, she rose from securities saleswoman to head of the municipal-finance department and chief of staff to John Mack when he was the firm\u2019s president. In the mid-1990s, she headed a cost-cutting drive that included banning Morgan Stanley executives from staying at the St. Regis hotel in New York.\n\nWhen necessary, she showed she could shout and slam down phones as well as her alpha male colleagues. \u201cWall Street is a little bit like boxing,\u201d she told the New York Times in 1996. \u201cQuite frankly, to survive you have to know how to give a good punch as well as how to take one.\u201d\n\nMs. La Roche died of pancreatic cancer Aug. 25 at her farm in Sharon, Conn. She was 70.\n\nIn 1987, she was one of three women appointed as the first female managing directors at Morgan Stanley. In 1996, she became the first woman to chair the Public Securities Association.\n\nIn her cost-cutting role, she ordered people to fly coach and restrain their dining expenses. \u201cShe was fearless,\u201d said Thomas Nides, a former colleague. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any problem telling people they were wrong. It didn\u2019t always go over particularly well,\u201d but she was acting in the bank\u2019s best interest, he said.\n\nAnother former colleague recalled a Morgan Stanley dinner party for clients at which some of the firm\u2019s investment bankers were gabbing with their colleagues instead of mingling with the clients. Ms. La Roche ordered them to go talk to the clients.\n\nMr. Mack, her longtime boss, described her as smart, reliable in getting tough jobs done, and \u201creally rough and tough.\u201d\n\nMarie-Elaine Andree La Roche was born Aug. 17, 1949, in New York and grew up in northern New Jersey. Her father, who had immigrated from Haiti, was a civil engineer at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Her mother, of French descent, was a schoolteacher.\n\nHer path to Wall Street was roundabout. She earned a foreign-service degree from Georgetown University in 1971 and an M.B.A. from American University in 1978. Her early jobs included working for Donald Rumsfeld when he was a member of Congress and a White House official and for George Shultz when he was Treasury secretary.\n\nShe worked in investment management at Citibank and as an equity saleswoman at Wainwright Securities before joining Morgan Stanley in 1978.\n\nShe was based in China twice\u2014as CEO of China International Capital Corp., or CICC, in the late 1990s and as vice chairman of a Chinese securities unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. from 2008 to 2010.\n\nShe later returned to CICC as chief executive of an investment-banking unit in New York. Starting in 2012, she served as a director of Marsh & McLennan Cos., a global insurance broker. She was also on the board of China Construction Bank .\n\nOn weekends, she typically stayed at her home on a farm in Sharon, Conn., in the northwestern corner of the state. After buying the 625-acre property more than two decades ago, she insisted on maintaining it as a working farm, producing corn and hay. She also created a business renting space there for weddings and other events. In nearby Salisbury, Conn., she opened an antique shop.\n\nWorried that chain stores would hurt the quality of life in the area, she bought several family-owned pharmacies.\n\nMs. La Roche is survived by three children.\n\nWrite to James R.
