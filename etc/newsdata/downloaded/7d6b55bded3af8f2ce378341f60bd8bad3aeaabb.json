Some experts, including Beightol, say wood combs can be better for more voluptuous beards. \u201cFor thicker beards, larger-sized wooden combs are popular with our guys,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cthese combs tend to have wider-spaced teeth to help detangle curly and thick hair.\u201d And Priore likes wood \u201cbecause it\u2019s usually sanded very smoothly; it keeps the snagability down.\u201d He admits that a wood comb might not be the most practical to slip in your pocket, but says, \u201cIf you want a nice comb you can keep at the house, go for a wooden comb.\u201d And when we asked another set of experts about tools for trimming beards, they recommended using wooden combs over plastic, which one expert said \u201ccan cause static in facial hair.\u201d\n\nWooden beard combs are typically available in two options: a double-sided comb with fine teeth on one side and wide teeth on the other, or a simpler, single-sided comb. According to the experts, it really comes down to personal preference, but three said that double-sided is the way to go. As Beightol explains: \u201cA two-sided comb is good for using if your beard has different patches of thickness, which is common with long, thick beards. So the wider teeth help with thick patches and the narrower teeth help with thinner or finer hair.\u201d Ruscetta suggests this one from the Art of Shaving. \u201cAll beard combs look pretty similar,\u201d says Ruscetta, but he likes that this one is on the thicker side and should be strong enough to carry around if you want to. It\u2019s made from sandalwood, so it will have a light natural scent, and it comes with a pouch to store it in.", "description": "The best beard combs include a set of acetate beard and mustache combs from Kent, a double-sided sandalwood beard comb from The Art of Shaving, and wood beard comes from Parker and Breezelike and Beardoholic.
