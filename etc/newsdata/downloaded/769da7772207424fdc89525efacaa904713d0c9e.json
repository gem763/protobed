Gabby Giffords was shot, she helped introduce a gun control bill expanding background checks. USA TODAY\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday will unveil a broad gun safety agenda that includes a plan to pour $900 million in federal money over eight years into anti-gun violence programs in some of the nation\u2019s cities hardest hit by gun violence, according to two senior campaign officials.\n\nBiden is among 10 Democratic White House hopefuls set to take part in Wednesday\u2019s gun safety forum in Las Vegas hosted by the gun control advocacy groups March for Our Lives and Giffords. Aides say Biden will unveil parts of his gun safety agenda during his appearance at the the forum.\n\nLike nearly all of the candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Biden backs an assault weapons ban, bolstering background checks, and launching a federal buyback program to take military-style firearms off the streets.\n\nBut in emphasizing the scourge of urban violence in his gun policy, Biden is trying to underscore to voters in inner city communities that he recognizes the impact violence is having on communities that endure hundreds of gun-related killings per year without getting the same sort of media or political attention as mass shootings.\n\nIn this file photo taken on September 24, 2019 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden makes a statement on Ukraine during a press conference at the Hotel Du Pont in Wilmington, Delaware. - Joe Biden may have inadvertently triggered the scandal now threatening Donald Trump's presidency, but it has also impacted his own White House bid and the Democrat could soon learn whether it dooms his candidacy or bolsters it.

Communities that have used such programming have recorded 30% to 60% drop in homicides in districts or neighborhoods that have deployed violence interrupters, according to Giffords.\n\nThe former vice president is also proposing spending some of the $900 million on funding hospital-based violence intervention programs that help connect young people injured by gun violence with social and economic services while they are still hospitalized. The thinking is that such early intervention could decrease the likelihood they engage in or are victims of gun violence in the future.\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal calls for the money to be spent in 40 cities \u2014 the nation\u2019s 20 cities with the highest per capita homicide rate and the 20 cities with the highest total number of homicides \u2014 on intervention programming that has proven to have success, Biden aides said.\n\nBiden isn\u2019t alone in speaking in favor of intervention programs. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has also called for investing money into urban gun violence intervention programs, and has seen his city make progress in reducing homicides and shootings after launching a program called Stand Against Violence Everyday, or S.A.V.E.\n\nIn this Thursday, June 14, 2018 photo, Chicago Police officers investigate the scene where two people were shot in Chicago. A 12-year-old Michigan girl spending the summer in Chicago was fatally shot at the scene, hours after attending a cousin's eighth-grade graduation. Family members at the hospital identified the girl as She'nyah O'Flynn of Covert, Michigan. She and a man who was injured were apparently unintended victims of gunfire from a nearby party. Police say there have been no arrests. (Photo: Tyler LaRiviere, AP)\n\nCuring gun violence: Can you change how criminals think? Chicago hopes behavioral therapy can cut gun violence\n\nWood solution: Baltimore is mired in violent crime. Could part of the solution be found in reclaimed wood?\n\nAs part of a plan to improve public safety and reduce mass incarceration, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorsed the federal government\u2019s backing of violence intervention programs \u201cthat divert young people from criminal activity, before the police become involved.\u201d\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Biden has frequently touted himself as a proven and battle-tested foe of the National Rifle Association, because of his role as a senator in passing the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nIn the aftermath of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, Biden has also sought to frame President Donald Trump as afraid of taking on the NRA and backing tightened background checks, which polling shows is supported by the vast majority of Americans.\n\nTrump on multiple occasions during his presidency has voiced support for new gun safety measures before backtracking.\n\n\u201cThe president has no intestinal fortitude to deal with this,\u201d Biden said in a speech in Iowa last month. \u201cHe knows better. His instinct was to say yeah, we're going to do something on background checks. What's he doing? Come on. This is disgraceful.\u201d\n\nBaltimore: Trump says he's 'the least racist person' in the world, sees Joe Biden as Democratic debate favorite\n\nCarnage: Trump, fed up with Chicago 'carnage,' threatens to send Feds\n\nBy making urban violence a high priority in his gun policy agenda, it could also serve Biden well in the African American community, which polls show have provided him with his most steadfast support as 2020 caucuses and primaries near. Black Americans are 10 times more likely than white Americans to die by gun homicide, and 14 times more likely than white Americans to be injured in a gun assault, according to CDC statistics cited by Giffords.\n\nIt also provides Biden an opportunity to contrast himself to black voters with Trump, who has said that Baltimore residents are \"living in hell\" and spoken disparagingly of the \"horrible carnage\" of gun violence in Chicago.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/02/joe-biden-proposes-spending-900-m-decrease-urban-gun-violence/3837864002/", "description": "Joe Biden will unveil a gun safety agenda that calls for $900 million in federal spending in some of the nation\u2019s cities hardest hit by gun violence.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Published A.M.
