I find that the first bumping move from the level of 2904 up to 2919, after the announcement of Jobs Data, shows an immediate upward move before Fed\u2019s decision on . No doubt that the earnings growth slowed to a standstill as trade uncertainty and the fading effects of President Donald Trump's tax cuts took its toll. I find that an immediate reactionary move shown by S&P 500 Futures may result in higher opening of , but Fed\u2019s reluctance on Interest Rate cut may extend the prevailing exhaustion in S&P 500.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the growing uncertainty with the step taken by the United States on European tariff issue seems to disrupt a little progress on Sino-U.S. tariff trade front, which is supposed to be taken care of in October\u2019s upcoming meet between the United States and China; have capped the upper side of S&P 500 at 2959, whereas the downside looks open up to 2828 during the upcoming week. I find that the S&P 500 Futures will have to face stiff resistance at the level of 2929 before moving upward; but 200 DMA at the level of 2959 will definitely provide strong resistance.\n\nTrading Strategy: Short Position\n\nEntry Level: 2949 \u2013 2959\n\nStop Loss: 2969 - 2989\n\nTarget: 2849 - 2959\n\nProfit Probability: 100 points\n\nLoss Probability: 20 points\n\nRisk/Reward Ratio: 1:5\n\nS&P 500 Futures\n\nS&P 500 Futures - Daily Chart\n\nS&P 500 Futures - 4 Hr.
