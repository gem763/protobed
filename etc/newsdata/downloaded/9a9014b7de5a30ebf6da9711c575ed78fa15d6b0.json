You can do anything.\"\n\nHe added: \"Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\n\n'Blood coming out'\n\n\"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever,\" Trump said of then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly after she asked during an Republican primary debate in 2015 about previous misogynistic statements. He also called Kelly a \"bimbo\".\n\n'Pig'\n\nTrump slammed comedian and actress Rosie O'Donnell as a \"pig\" in 2006, after she called him a \"snake-oil salesman,\" sparking a decade-long feud.\n\n'That face'\n\n\"Look at that face,\" Trump once said of his Republican primary rival Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard executive. \"Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\"\n\n'Miss Piggy'\n\nWhen he owned the Miss Universe franchise, Trump called the 1996 Venezuelan winner Alicia Machado \"Miss Piggy,\" saying \"this is someone who likes to eat\".\n\nMachado later said she suffered eating disorders and psychological trauma as a result of the public shaming.", "description": "US President Donald Trump told a Minneapolis rally that Joe Biden, one of the Democratic frontrunners vying to challenge him in next year's elections, had only been a good vice president because \"he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7779/79c58f17f8794c97aaaa7338dee861e9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
