(Photo by David Purdy/Getty Images)\n\nOklahoma assistant Shane Beamer got a little too excited after OU\u2019s first touchdown of the 2019 season.\n\nAfter Jalen Hurts hit fullback Jeremiah Hall for a 14-yard score in the first quarter of Sunday night\u2019s game against Houston, Beamer was so fired up that he excitedly headbutted Hall, who still had his helmet on. In the aftermath, Beamer had to get stitches above his left eyebrow and also had a bump on his forehead.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSo Shane Beamer head-butted Jeremiah Hall after a touchdown and had to be stitched up?!?\n\n\n\nThat's dedication by a position coach. #Sooners pic.twitter.com/AyJ7Con9Ex \u2014 Eric Bailey (@EricBaileyTW) September 2, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s how ESPN\u2019s Holly Rowe described it during Sunday night\u2019s broadcast:\n\n\u201cWe have not had too many injuries tonight, which is a good sign, but the one injury that has been significant was to Shane Beamer, one of the assistant coaches for Oklahoma. You might notice he has got stitches above his left eyebrow and a pretty good egg on the noggin,\u201d Rowe said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t very smart after Jeremiah Hall, his H-back, scored the first touchdown of the game. He decided to headbutt him with his helmet on. Unfortunately, Shane did not have his helmet on, so the coach has an injury tonight.\u201d\n\nOops.\n\nBeamer, the son of legendary Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer, is in his second season on Lincoln Riley\u2019s staff and holds the title of \u201cassistant head coach for offense.\u201d Beamer coaches the team\u2019s fullbacks and tight ends, so he was especially excited that Hall reached the end zone for the first time in his college career.\n\nStory continues\n\nHall, a redshirt sophomore, played in 14 games a year ago, but had only two catches for 36 yards and four carries for 21 yards. In Sunday night\u2019s game, Hall had three catches for 25 yards and, of course, his first career touchdown in OU\u2019s 49-31 win. You might as well add a lesson learned for his position coach \u2014 don\u2019t headbutt a guy wearing a helmet \u2014 to Hall\u2019s stat line.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Oklahoma assistant Shane Beamer got a little too excited after OU\u2019s first touchdown of the 2019 season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YoyVPA4UwxodViNtCAI7xQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NjIuOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/soQpjvoeHCKImu3enuEF6g--~B/aD0yNDI3O3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4cb26790-cd32-11e9-afe7-203b93fa83df"}
