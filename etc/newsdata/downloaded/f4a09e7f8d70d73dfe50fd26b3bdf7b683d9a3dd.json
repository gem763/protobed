In total 24 different apps were infected with the malware. Those apps were installed roughly 472,000 times. Metadata suggests that the apps started their campaigns in June 2019, although some may have also existed in the past.\n\nThat said, Kuprins notes that Google seems to be on top of the issue. Google removed all of the impacted apps from the Google Play store without any contact from the security researchers.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of apps infected with the Joker malware:\n\nAdvocate Wallpaper\n\nAge Face\n\nAltar Message\n\nAntivirus Security \u2013 Security Scan\n\nBeach Camera\n\nBoard picture editing\n\nCertain Wallpaper\n\nClimate SMS\n\nCollate Face Scanner\n\nCute Camera\n\nDazzle Wallpaper\n\nDeclare Message\n\nDisplay Camera\n\nGreat VPN\n\nHumour Camera\n\nIgnite Clean\n\nLeaf Face Scanner\n\nMini Camera\n\nPrint Plant scan\n\nRapid Face Scanner\n\nReward Clean\n\nRuddy SMS\n\nSoby Camera\n\nSpark Wallpaper\n\nIf you did install any of the apps on this list, now\u2019s the time to uninstall them. You\u2019ll also want to pay attention to your credit card statements to make sure you haven\u2019t been signed up for anything without your knowledge.\n\nThis is the second time in recent weeks that malware was discovered in popular Android apps. In late August, Kaspersky found that a scanning app called CamScanner contained malware as well.\n\nKuprins also suggests paying attention to what permissions apps ask for when you install them on your phone. Presumably, some of these apps made it clear that they were accessing some parts of your phone that they shouldn\u2019t have needed access to. Whenever you see something like that in an app, especially a little-known Android app, it\u2019s a good idea of exercise caution, and potentially not install the apps in the first place.", "description": "A number of apps have recently made their way into the Google Play Store with a little something extra: malware", "authors": ["Emily Price"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y6ctz3KDG0B3RFGGP2TmcA--~B/aD05OTg7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/digital_trends_973/73df1644b74db2e50b6fca64dd43b833", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
