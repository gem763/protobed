Antonopoulos addresses the speculation about what will be the \"next Bitcoin\" or the \"next Ethereum.\" Echoing previous talks like 'Invest in Education Instead of Speculation,' he argues that the focus on searching for the best investment or time to buy amid a sea of pump-and-dump schemes is a worse way to spend your time than gathering knowledge about how these systems work. He also tells the story about how he bought bitcoin for the first time, why it is not the get-rich-quick scheme you may think it is, and the ways they could fail.\n\n\n\nThis talk was delivered at the Athens' Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech meetup on July 12th 2019 in Athens, Greece.\n\nLiked this video?
