It\u2019s just so obvious his importance,\u201d said Klopp.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cAnd it is in both directions \u2013 in attack and defence, small spaces, big spaces, it is hard challenges, fine football, pretty much all of that\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he the perfect midfielder? Yes, from the skill-set, 100 per cent. He has all that you need.\n\n\u201cThere was his header against Barcelona too. He is not the \u00adtallest, but he is good in the air.\n\n\u201cHe is a good jumper with good timing, all that stuff. It all makes him a pretty good footballer.\n\n\u201cThat is how it should be. It is not my fault if he goes under the radar. You cannot ask me why he goes under the radar. I don\u2019t set the radar!\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nWijnaldum is on record saying he has a love-hate relationship with the German and sometimes his anger boils over with Klopp\u2019s continual search for perfection.\n\nAnd nothing sums up their relationship better than last season\u2019s 4-3 \u00adChampions League \u00adsemi-final win against Barcelona at \u00adAnfield.\n\nWijnaldum has \u00adadmitted he was furious with Klopp for leaving him on the bench that night. But, after coming on at half-time, the Dutchman channelled his anger the right way to score two goals in as many minutes to help \u00adLiverpool catapult Klopp\u2019s stars to the final against today\u2019s opponents \u00adTottenham.\n\nKlopp said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he is a \u00adpersonality in the dressing room. He is not the guy who says yes to everything.\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not really knocking on my door, but, just like any other human being, if there are things he doesn\u2019t like, it\u2019s normal.\n\n\u201cCharacter is what makes you the person you are and sometimes it stops them going a bit further.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind players knocking on my door, but it shouldn\u2019t \u00adhappen too often. It is more about the information. If my information is correct, then hopefully they will accept it rather than making it a more personal thing.\n\n\u201cThe perfect reaction was when I didn\u2019t start him against \u00adBarcelona at home \u2013 and he came on and scored twice.\n\n\u201cI said to him, \u2018You scored twice!\u2019 He replied, \u2018Yes, but that\u2019s because you didn\u2019t let me out from the start\u2019. I said, \u2018So, who is right now?\u201d\n\nKlopp has watched the full replay of \u00adLiverpool\u2019s 2-0 Madrid win twice \u2013 and he knows revenge could be on Spurs\u2019 agenda as they arrive at Anfield today after a poor start.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t change what \u00adhappened in the final, but they can use that and that will not be helpful for us,\u201d added Klopp.\n\n\u201cThey have quality and are in a situation they don\u2019t want to be in.\u201d", "description": "Klopp insists that he would not change Wijnaldum's mentality of speaking his mind when he feels the need to", "authors": ["Steve Bates", "Image", "Pa", "Reuters", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20731415.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-Training-Session-Melwood-Training-Ground.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
