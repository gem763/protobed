(AP) - The dozens of people who perished as flames engulfed a dive boat off the Southern California coast came from many walks of life. They included two high schoolers, a hairdresser, a marine biologist, software engineers, a special effects designer for Disney, a nature photographer, a nurse and a family of five celebrating a birthday.\n\nTheir common love of scuba diving brought them to the ruggedly beautiful coastline of the Channel Islands for a three-day excursion. Thirty-four people died when the Conception caught fire before dawn on Labor Day as it anchored off Santa Cruz Island.\n\nFlames above deck blocked the one stairway and an emergency exit hatch leading from sleeping bunks to the upper decks and gave those below virtually no chance of getting out, authorities said.\n\nOnly one person remained missing on Wednesday. Divers pulled 33 bodies from the seabed and the charred wreckage of the sunken, overturned boat.\n\nFive crew members, including the captain, were above deck and managed to escape.\n\nThe only crew member to die was Allie Kurtz, 26, who quit her corporate job at Paramount Pictures to work on dive boats. Kurtz, who grew up in Illinois, had recently been promoted to deckhand.\n\n\u201cHer love was just always, always the water,\u201d Kurtz\u2019s grandmother, Doris Lapporte, 71, told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cShe would joke, \u2018I am going to be a pirate one day.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe captain, the boat\u2019s owner and others were interviewed for hours as the National Transportation Safety Board investigated the fire, NTSB member Jennifer Homendy said Tuesday.\n\nFour crew members were given tests for alcohol, which were negative, and all five survivors had drug tests but the results are pending, Homendy said.\n\nThe Conception wasn\u2019t required by federal regulation to have fire sprinklers aboard, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nThose killed included Apple engineer Steve Salika and his wife, Diana Adamic, who went on the trip with their daughter Tia Salika to celebrate the teen\u2019s 17th birthday, company senior vice president Deirdre O\u2019Brien told The Mercury News newspaper. Apple colleague Dan Garcia joined them.\n\nTia was with Berenic Felipe, a fellow student at Pacific Collegiate Charter School in Santa Cruz, according to a letter sent to the school community obtained by NBC News.\n\nAlso aboard was visual effects designer Charles McIlvain, who was known for his work on films such as \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cGreen Lantern.\u201d\n\nLisa Fiedler was a 52-year-old hairdresser and photographer from the community of Mill Valley north of San Francisco, her mother, Nancy Fiedler, told San Francisco\u2019s ABC affiliate, KGO television.\n\nSan Francisco-based Education platform Brilliant confirmed that senior software engineer Carrie McLaughlin and Kristian Takvam, vice president of engineering, were aboard.\n\n___\n\nWatson reported from San Diego.
