Just look to the countless obituaries detailing the \u201cdeath\u201d of the cryptocurrency on this site.\n\nBut, this narrative has started to change. Year to date, Bitcoin has gained a jaw-dropping 150%, shocking investors the world over.\n\nWhile crypto investors are used to such moves, Bitcoin\u2019s strength comes as the macroeconomic and geopolitical stage has started to rapidly deteriorate.\n\nThis dichotomy has resulted in many economists, investors, and even politicians starting to give Bitcoin a nod as a store of value and a safe haven. Or, to put it more bluntly, the cryptocurrency might be a much-needed escape hatch from the fiat system and government mismanagement.\n\nIndeed, BTC was created by a pseudonymous individual, is secured by a global group of miners, and is backed by no government, traditional finance system, or common entity. And, Bitcoin was released in the wake (and seemingly as a result) of the 2008 Great Recession.\n\nA Harrowing Macro Environment\n\nOver the past year, the geopolitical and macroeconomic stage has rapidly deteriorated. There is now over $17 trillion worth of negative-yielding bonds (debt), most of which is high-grade; a dovish Federal Reserve that recently cut rates for the first time since the Great Recession; Brexit and other bouts of turmoil in the European Union; and currency crises in places like Venezuela, where Bitcoin is gripping these economies.\n\nBut it\u2019s getting worse.\n\nIn August, you saw the Argentinian Peso collapse by 26%, while its equities market when into a freefall. Just look to Argentina\u2019s century bonds, which currently trades at 38 cents to the dollar, falling from around 80. (Bitcoin, by the way, is trading at a premium in Argentina.)\n\nDenmark recently issued a mortgage that had a negative 0.5% interest rates, meaning that you\u2019re borrowing money to buy a house to then pay back the bank less than the principal.\n\nSiemens issued a two-year note with a negative 30 bps effective yield and a zero interest rate coupon; the country of Germany issued an 800 something million Euro worth of a 30-year bond with an effective yield of negative 11 bps.\n\nAll this, according to Travis Kling of Ikigai Asset Management, will only be beneficial for Bitcoin. At Bitcoin Is _, an educational event hosted by the LA Chargers\u2019s Russell Okung, Kling stated:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is currently a risk asset. But it\u2019s a risk asset with a specific set of investment characteristics that will only become more attractive the more irresponsible monetary and fiscal policy becomes.\u201d\n\nLooking forward to spreading the good word!

You ask. Let us explain.\n\nIn all of the above scenarios mentioned, Bitcoin can be used as a way out.\n\nInstead of \u201cinvesting\u201d in negative-yielding debt, you could purchase an asset that has zero yield, this being gold or Bitcoin; Instead of holding your wealth in devaluating fiat currency, you could buy a store of value like Bitcoin; and so on and so forth.\n\nYou see, unlike fiat monies, Bitcoin is anti-fragile, decentralized, non-sovereign, uninflatable (actually deflationary), immutable, uncensorable, borderless, permissionless, and programmable. All these characteristics give it the ability to be used as a \u201csafe haven\u201d or \u201cstore of value\u201d in tumultuous times.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take this writer\u2019s word for it.\n\nRaoul Pal, the former head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s hedge fund sales division in Europe, explained in the context of the expectation of rates going negative in the U.S. and the macroeconomic backdrop turning tumultuous that investors should purchase bonds, dollars, diamonds, and, of course, Bitcoin. Pal has claimed that Bitcoin is the asset to invest in, as it effectively is an \u201coption on the future financial system\u201d.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "For most of its life, Bitcoin (BTC) was seen as a volatile gamble that was most likely to fail.
