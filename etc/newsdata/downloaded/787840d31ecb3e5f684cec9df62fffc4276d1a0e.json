An archived replay of the webcast, including the related presentation materials, will be available at www.irwendys.com. As part of this presentation, the Company made the following announcements.\n\nPreliminary Third Quarter Global Systemwide Sales, North America Same-Restaurant Sales and Global Restaurant Growth Results\n\nThe Company announced its preliminary Global systemwide sales, North America same-restaurant sales and global new restaurant development for the third quarter ended September 29, 2019.\n\nGlobal systemwide sales grew 5.7% in the quarter and 4.1% year-to date. For the 2019 fiscal year, the Company now expects to be at the high end of its previously announced systemwide sales guidance range of 3.0 to 4.0 percent.\n\nNorth America same-restaurant sales grew 4.4% in the quarter and 2.4% year-to date.\n\nGlobal restaurants grew 40 on a gross basis and 24 on a net basis in the quarter and 111 on a gross basis and 32 on a net basis year-to-date.\n\nThe Company plans to report its full financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2019 on Wednesday, November 6.\n\nBoard Authorizes a 20 Percent Dividend Rate Increase\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors has authorized a 20 percent increase in the Company's quarterly cash dividend rate from 10 cents to 12 cents per share. The increase will be effective with the next quarterly dividend payment, which is payable on December 16, 2019, to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2019.\n\nThe approximate number of common shares outstanding as of October 7, 2019 was 230.3 million.\n\nNew Long-Term Outlook\n\nThe Company announced updated 2020 goals and a new long-term outlook.\n\n2020 Goals\n\nLong-Term Outlook \u2013 2021-2024\n\nThis release includes forward-looking guidance for certain non-GAAP financial measures, including systemwide sales, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The Company excludes certain expenses and benefits from adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, such as the impact from our advertising funds, including the net change in the restricted operating assets and liabilities and any excess or deficit of advertising funds revenues over advertising funds expenses, impairment of long-lived assets, reorganization and realignment costs, system optimization (gains) losses, net, loss on early extinguishment of debt, timing and resolution of certain tax matters and the impact of the proposed settlement of the Financial Institutions case. Due to the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of those expenses and benefits, the Company is unable without unreasonable effort to provide reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA or net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis release contains certain statements that are not historical facts, including, most importantly, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of The Wendy's Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\").

Numerous factors beyond the control of the Company and its franchisees may affect new restaurant openings. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that commitments under development agreements with franchisees will result in new restaurant openings. In addition, numerous factors beyond the control of the Company and its franchisees may affect franchisees' ability to reimage existing restaurants in accordance with the Company's expectations.\n\nAll future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or how they may affect the Company.\n\nThe Company undertakes no duty or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this release as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by federal securities laws, although the Company may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\n\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and systemwide sales.\n\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and systemwide sales as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company's peers and competitors. Adjusted EBITDA and systemwide sales are also used by the Company in establishing performance goals for purposes of executive compensation. The Company believes its presentation of adjusted EBITDA and systemwide sales provides a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate our historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that vary from period to period without correlation to our core operating performance and highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature and/or size of the items being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are not indicative of our future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use adjusted EBITDA and systemwide sales in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance in addition to the Company's performance based on GAAP results.\n\nThis release also includes disclosure and guidance regarding the Company's free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by the Company as an internal measure of liquidity. Free cash flow is also used by the Company in establishing performance goals for purposes of executive compensation. As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018, the Company now defines free cash flow as cash flows from operations minus (i) capital expenditures and (ii) the net change in the restricted operating assets and liabilities of the advertising funds and any excess/deficit of advertising funds revenue over advertising funds expense included in net income, as reported under GAAP. The impact of our advertising funds is excluded because the funds are used solely for advertising and are not available for the Company's working capital needs. The Company believes free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for investors and other interested persons because it communicates how much cash flow is available for working capital needs or to be used for repurchasing shares, paying dividends, repaying or refinancing debt, financing possible acquisitions or investments or other uses of cash.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and systemwide sales are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures does not replace the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and systemwide sales (and similarly titled financial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this release should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of the Company's performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nKey Business Measures\n\nThe Company tracks its results of operations and manages its business using certain key business measures, including same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales, which are measures commonly used in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding Company performance.\n\nSame-restaurant sales and systemwide sales each include sales by both Company-operated and franchise restaurants. The Company reports same-restaurant sales for new restaurants after they have been open for 15 continuous months and for reimaged restaurants as soon as they reopen.\n\nFranchise restaurant sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy's restaurants. Sales by franchise restaurants are not recorded as Company revenues and are not included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by Wendy's franchisees and, as a result, sales by franchisees have a direct effect on the Company's royalty revenues and profitability.\n\nSame-restaurant sales and systemwide sales exclude sales from Venezuela and, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, Argentina due to the highly inflationary economies of those countries.\n\nThe Company calculates same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales growth on a constant currency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company believes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year comparability.\n\nNote Regarding Dividends\n\nThere can be no assurance that any additional regular quarterly cash dividends will be declared or paid after the date hereof, or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. Future dividend payments, if any, are subject to applicable law, will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be based on such factors as the Company's earnings, financial condition and cash requirements and other factors.\n\nAbout Wendy's\n\nWendy's\u00ae was founded in 1969 by Dave Thomas in Columbus, Ohio. Dave built his business on the premise, \"Quality is our Recipe\u00ae,\" which remains the guidepost of the Wendy's system. Wendy's is best known for its made-to-order square hamburgers, using fresh, never frozen beef*, freshly-prepared salads with hand-chopped lettuce, and other signature items like chili, baked potatoes and the Frosty\u00ae dessert. The Wendy's Company (WEN) is committed to doing the right thing and making a positive difference in the lives of others. This is most visible through the Company's support of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption\u00ae and its signature Wendy's Wonderful Kids\u00ae program, which seeks to find every child in the North American foster care system a loving, forever home. Today, Wendy's and its franchisees employ hundreds of thousands of people across more than 6,700 restaurants worldwide with a vision of becoming the world's most thriving and beloved restaurant brand.
