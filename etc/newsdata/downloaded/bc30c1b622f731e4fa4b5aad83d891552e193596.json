Our report tells the story of women who have endured unsafe living arrangements, overcrowding, broken friendships and further abuse while sofa-surfing.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cHostels or emergency accommodation are not appropriate either \u2013 women recovering from domestic abuse need the specialist, holistic support that domestic abuse refuges provide. It goes without saying that survivors should not have to sleep rough, yet, for the third year running, we found that this is still happening, even to pregnant women and children.\n\n\u201cAs it stands today, a survivor\u2019s access to support services is dependent on her immigration status. We are calling on the government to deliver a domestic abuse bill that guarantees access to support for every survivor, including women with \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019.\u201d\n\nMs Claire said the research found black and minority ethnic (BME) women are far more likely to face homelessness as a result of domestic abuse.\n\nThe report comes in the context of increasing cuts to refuges across the country \u2013 with women and children having been turned away from oversubscribed shelters and forced to return to abusive homes after years of funding cuts. Several refuges have closed since 2010.\n\nThose in need of a refuge to escape their abuser are finding it harder than ever to find a free bed, with the most recent figures showing 60 per cent of them are unable to. Local authority spending on refuges has been cut from \u00a331.2m in 2010 to \u00a323.9m in 2017.\n\nSpecialist services for BME survivors have been hardest hit by the cuts \u2013 with funding moving towards generic service providers instead. Twenty-two BME refuges across the country have had their funding cut or have been taken over by larger organisations in the past 12 years\n\nWomen\u2019s Aid\u2019s Annual Audit, released in spring, found a shortfall of refuge bed spaces of 1,715 in England. The report also found just over half of domestic abuse service providers were running an area of their service with no dedicated funding and a third reported that since 2014 they have been forced to lay off staff because of funding shortages.\n\nAccording to a new guide for landlords in Scotland released last month, perpetrators of domestic abuse who live in social housing should be evicted to stop their victims becoming homeless.\n\nScottish Women\u2019s Aid launched a new best practice guide for social housing landlords and local authority housing providers which states victims should remain in their homes while the abuser loses their right to the tenancy.\n\nIt came as their research found domestic abuse is the biggest cause of homelessness for women and children in Scotland.\n\nIn 2017-18, women made up 78 per cent of homelessness applications in Scotland where \u201cdispute within the household (violent or abusive)\u201d was given as the reason for homelessness. More than half had children.", "description": "Women escaping domestic abuse are being pushed into homelessness and forced to endure further abuse from their partners due to being denied refuge space, a new report has found.
