If the trademark application is accepted, it would be applied to dresses, jackets, socks, and even cosmetics, according to the filing. There are already other filings for variations of \u201crise and shine,\u201d meaning there\u2019s a chance the application will be rejected.\n\nThe meme is based on an eight-second clip from a YouTube vlog Jenner published on October 10th that included a tour of her Kylie Cosmetic offices. In the video, she goes to wake up her daughter, Stormi Webster, from a nap. Upon entering an oddly barren room, Jenner sings the phrase \u201crise and shine,\u201d even though Stormi is already awake and looking around. It\u2019s a bizarre clip, but the audio quickly circulated around TikTok. Even Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors got in on the action.\n\nInstead of shying away from the mockery, Jenner leaned into it. She launched two \u201crise and shine\u201d hoodies on her personal shop for $65, both of which sold out almost immediately. Based on the trademark filing, it seems like Jenner wants to continue the wave of monetization. On Twitter, where Jenner has nearly 30 million subscribers, she retweeted some of the best TikTok videos. This was followed immediately by a video of her daughter dancing to a lengthened, remixed version of her performance while Jenner cheered in the background. Then, finally, there\u2019s a plug for her new merchandise.\n\nJenner isn\u2019t the first Kardashian family member to monetize an embarrassing viral meme. Her older sister Kim Kardashian has created a line of successful products based on memes. Kim\u2019s infamous crying face from a scene in Kourtney and Kim Take New York is one example. Her exaggerated, tear-faced crying sequence went on to become apparel. It adorned sweaters and iPhone cases, stickers and laptop decals.\n\nIt didn\u2019t stop there, either. Kim then went on to include the face along with other key moments from Keeping Up with the Kardashians \u2014 including a scene where she hits her younger sister, Khloe, with a purse during a fight \u2014 in an emoji sticker pack. The emoji set, Kimoji, sold in 2015 for $1.99. It was so successful that people assumed problems occurring within the App Store during Kimoji\u2019s launch were due to high demand. Although Apple later denied it, Kim took credit for the App Store malfunction. Kanye West, Kim\u2019s husband, even referenced the success of the Kimoji app in his song, \u201cFacts,\u201d rapping, \u201cWe made a million a minute.\u201d\n\nApple, I'm so sorry I broke your App Store!!! \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) December 21, 2015\n\nThe Kardashians helped kickstart a wave of monetizing embarrassing moments that become iconic in their own right. It\u2019s a facet of merchandising that personalities on YouTube and TikTok also use. YouTuber Shane Dawson is designing an entire eye shadow palette around cringe-inducing moments that happened to him and his friends, for example. Even before that, Dawson\u2019s entire brand was based on self-deprecating memes that helped his career blossom.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Jenner saw a rising trend and decided to capitalize on it as fast as possible.", "description": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s innocuous office tour video on YouTube morphed into a massive TikTok meme, which she\u2019s now turned into sold-out merchandise and a trademark application that would cover even more products.
