Mr. Niami could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nDesigned by architect Paul McClean, it sits on one acre and spans 20,000 square feet, according to the listing with Rayni and Branden Williams of Hilton & Hyland, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nThe mansion has a wine cellar, two swimming pools, a car museum, a screening room and is described in the listing as a \u201cmodern space station.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe increased asking price stands out in the Los Angeles luxury market where many of the highest priced listings have received sizable price cuts.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Banksy\u2019s \u2018Devolved Parliament\u2019 Heading to Auction Prior to Brexit Day\n\nThe Los Angeles property dubbed Chartwell\u2014also the most expensive home on the market in the U.S.\u2014got significantly less expensive in June, after chopping $50 million from its asking price, taking its price tag down to $195 million from a whopping $245 million.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the former estate of the late film industry titan, Lew Wasserman, hit the market for $125 million. By March, the price had been trimmed to $97.5 million.\n\n\n\nAnd a 12-bedroom Bel Air mansion with its own helipad and a candy wall is currently asking $150 million, far below the $250 million it was first being shopped for in 2017.\n\n\n\nA wave of development has left the market oversaturated with high-priced megamansions, and there aren\u2019t enough buyers to go around, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-107627?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
