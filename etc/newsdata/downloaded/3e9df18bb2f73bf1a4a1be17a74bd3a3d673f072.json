Really? Because if somebody told me that, I\u2019d be like, \u2018You\u2019re 7 years old [in fact, he was 10]. You really had a knowing of what the fuck you were?\u2019 \u201d\n\nDissatisfied with life in Los Angeles, the Phoenixes moved back to Florida, settling in Gainesville, and River bought the family a ranch in Costa Rica.\n\nAs River\u2019s fame grew with Running on Empty, about a family of \u201960s radicals on the run, and an Indiana Jones movie, playing a young Indy, Joaquin wasn\u2019t getting any appealing offers and took a break to hang out on a beach with his dad in Mexico, learning Spanish and riding motorcycles. After he returned to the States, his brother was shooting the indie classic My Own Private Idaho with director Gus Van Sant. River began tutoring his younger brother about cinema. \u201cMy brother came home and he was like, \u2018We need to watch this movie called Raging Bull.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019 Prior to that, I watched Caddyshack and Spaceballs. And Woody Allen comedies.\u201d\n\nNot long after, he recalls his brother making a strange prediction. \u201cHe suggested I change my name [back to Joaquin] and then, I don\u2019t know, six months later, whatever it was, we were in Florida, we were in the kitchen, and he said, \u2018You\u2019re going to be an actor and you\u2019re going to be more well known than I am.\u2019 Me and my mom looked at each other like, \u2018What the fuck is he talking about?\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he said that or what he knew of me at the time. I hadn\u2019t been acting at all. But he also said it with a certain weight, with a knowing that seemed so absurd to me at the time, but of course now, in hindsight, you\u2019re like, \u2018How the fuck did he know?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen he was 16, Phoenix says, he was sent a dead frog in the mail to dissect for his biology studies, which prompted him to discontinue his studies. When his parents protested, he dared them \u201cto have me arrested.\u201d (His mother says she doesn\u2019t recall this.) Around that time, he appeared in Ron Howard\u2019s Parenthood as a brooding, inarticulate adolescent grappling with his budding sexuality. Heart remembers her son\u2019s intense emotional commitment to the part, especially in a scene where Joaquin\u2019s character trashed his father\u2019s dental office and broke down crying. Afterward, she says, \u201cI had to come on the set and hold him, because he just inhabited what he believed that young child felt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S GOING TO BE OKAY, BUBBELEH,\u201d DE NIRO SAID TO PHOENIX.\n\nPhoenix says that he and his siblings were not frequent denizens of clubs like the Viper Room. His brother had gone there in 1993, and reportedly stayed in hopes of playing music. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was typical. To be honest, I don\u2019t think it was really\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what he would have wanted to have done with his night. He\u2019d, just before that, spent time just playing me new songs that he\u2019d written.\u201d\n\nAfter River\u2019s death, the family retreated to Costa Rica to escape the media glare as the tragedy metastasized into a cautionary tale of young Hollywood and became a never-ending stream of myth and conspiracy. \u201cWe just walked away from everything,\u201d says Heart. \u201cIt was horrendous. The newspapers, we didn\u2019t see any of that, we just walked away.\u201d\n\nThe family grieved in private for months. The first time any of the Phoenixes emerged from the Costa Rica compound was when Joaquin and his mother flew to New York so Joaquin could try out for a part in Gus Van Sant\u2019s latest film, To Die For, starring Nicole Kidman. (The casting assistant on the film, Meredith Tucker, still says his audition was the best she has ever seen.) When he arrived in New York, Phoenix hadn\u2019t acted in three or four years. \u201cAs soon as I saw him, I started crying,\u201d Van Sant says. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that would happen but it was pretty sad.\u201d", "description": "Calm amidst the controversy surrounding his new movie, The Joker, talks about his complicated journey, why it doesn\u2019t define him, and how he\u2019s finally learned to leave the darkness on the set.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Joe Haga", "Ethan James Gree", "Tom Guinnes", "Laura Bradley", "Dan Adler", "Yohana Desta", "Kenzie Bryant"], "top_image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d9217bc7b256900098a1748/16:9/w_2560,c_limit/201911-Joaquin-Phoenix-VF-Ethan-James-Green-tout.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
