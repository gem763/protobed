There are no prerequisites for applicants, but the scholarships are reserved for low-income individuals looking to learn programming skills.\n\nThis initiative is reserved for low-income individuals looking to learn the in-demand skills needed to land higher-paying jobs and advance their careers.\n\nNew initiatives to train American workers in tech-related fields couldn\u2019t come at a better time. According to McKinsey, 38.6 million people in the United States will potentially be displaced and need to change their jobs by 2030. Meanwhile companies are telling consulting organizations like Gartner that a shortage of available talent is their top concern.\n\nUdacity will roll out the program in two phases. The first is the 100,000 \u201cchallenge scholarships,\u201d which provide access to the company\u2019s introductory classes open to any skill level that require a few hours of work per week over a two to three-month period.\n\nThese students will get access to Udacity mentors and Community Managers and have a chance to qualify for one of Udacity\u2019s full Nanodegree programs. The top 10,000 students (based on their progress through the first phase of the program and overall contributions to the Udacity community) will have their Nanodegrees paid for.\n\nEach Udacity Nanodegree costs $399 per month, and students typically graduate within five months. According to data from the company, roughly half of students who have gotten jobs through the Udacity program have increased their salaries by an average of 38%.\n\n\u201cI hope every one of these students gets a better, higher-paying job,\u201d Dalporto says. \u201cThe challenge is that \u2014 as you know \u2014 education equals opportunity in this country, and so many people have been left out of the traditional education system in this country.\u201d\n\nFor Dalporto, the decision to launch this scholarship initiative was inspired by his experiences seeing how technology and economic transformation had hollowed the economy in his home state of West Virginia. The evolution of an automated economy changed the nature of the state \u2014 impacting everyone, not just the blue-collar workers that most people think of when they worry about the risks of automation.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get as broad a range of people into these programs as possible,\u201d says Dalporto. To that end, Dalporto says Udacity will partner with local leaders to customize the programs to specific geographies \u201cto have the maximal impact.\u201d\n\nThe biggest shift for the company is to offer its introductory classes as a separate program. Typically, Udacity has used those intro courses as an onramp into its more robust Nanodegree program.\n\nDalporto says the company would also consider offering certification to people who complete the initial training as a way to indicate achievement and flag skills that could be meaningful to potential employers.\n\n\u201cThese courses are quite full of content and they\u2019re quite challenging. [Completing one] shows that someone has a lot of determination and critical thinking skills and logical thinking skills,\u201d says Dalporto. \u201cIf you graduate from one of our courses or Nanodegrees it\u2019s a high indicator that you would be successful in other types of courses.\u201d\n\nIn all, the program will cost Udacity tens of millions of dollars, Dalporto says.\n\nDalporto sees the new initiative as an extension of the company\u2019s enterprise business. The newer business model launched only a few years ago and already represents a third of Udacity\u2019s revenue (growing at 100% year-over-year).\n\n\u201cReturning to my hometown in West Virginia, I see first-hand the hardship caused when entire industries disappear and automation displaces workers,\u201d Dalporto wrote on the Udacity blog. \u201cBut with the right skills-based learning programs, career advancement can become accessible to absolutely everyone. I\u2019m confident that Udacity\u2019s tech and analytics scholarships will provide every recipient with the chance to learn new skills, launch or advance their career, and unlock their potential in careers that will remain in demand as technology continues to evolve.\u201d", "description": "Udacity, the online education company founded by Sebastian Thrun, is launching a new scholarship initiative as part of the Pledge to America\u2019s Workers job training initiative undertaken by the administration of President Donald Trump.\u00a0 Under the leadership of newly minted chief executive Gabe Dalporto, Udacity is committing to giving away free introductory technology training classes [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/udacity-Team-H-IMG_5639.jpg?w=500", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
