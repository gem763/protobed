The native Nigerian never played American-style football until he went to college at Manitoba and learned the game with Canadian rules. Still, the Saints like the size and raw ability of the 6-foot-4, 300-pound Onyemata enough that they selected him in the fourth round of the 2016 draft.\n\nHe played in all 16 games as a rookie, either on defense or special teams, and was a regular on the defensive line by 2017, when the Saints won the first of consecutive NFC South titles. Last season, he also was a more effective pass-rusher and had a career-best 4\u00bd sacks.\n\n\u201cHis strength and his hands are really what separates him and makes him a dominant force in the run game,\u201d Saints middle linebacker Demario Davis said. \u201cHe\u2019s put a lot of time into becoming a better pass-rusher as well. He\u2019s just been an exceptional force for us and it\u2019s fun to play behind him.\u201d\n\nOnyemata was not permitted to practice last week and could not go to the game, which he watched at home on television. When the Saints pulled out a dramatic victory on Wil Lutz\u2019 58-yard field goal as time expired, Onyemata said he was relieved his absence wouldn\u2019t become a story line emerging from a loss.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been the best feeling. I\u2019ll say that,\u201d Onyemata conceded. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do much. Just watch and get your mind right to come back and play ball.\u201d\n\nThe Saints never gave up more than 112 yards in a regular season or playoff game last season. While the Saints gave up 68 yards more than that in Week 1, Payton said one factor was Houston QB Deshaun Watson\u2019s scrambling ability. He rushed for 40 yards. But Jordan said he \u201chated\u201d seeing Houston\u2019s rushing stats.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not our defense. That\u2019s not what we want our defense to stand for,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that you can be proud of.\u201d\n\nWhile no coach is pleased to lose a productive lineup regular because of an off-the-field error in judgment, Payton sounded pleased by the way Onyemata dealt with it.\n\n\u201cHe had a really good camp. I think he\u2019s handled it well,\u201d Payton said. \u201cHe\u2019s tough-minded. He\u2019s a tremendous teammate and a real good football player.\u201d\n\nOnyemata still sees his NFL career as somewhat surreal, given that he went to Manitoba to study environmental science and had his sights set on a career in Nigeria\u2019s oil industry. Having played youth soccer in Nigeria, Onyemata took up American football on the advice of college classmates when he was looking for an activity to satisfy his appetite for playing sports.\n\nDavis said Onyemata\u2019s aptitude for applying what he learns has been evident on the field.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s where he\u2019s supposed to be and doing what he\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe\u2019s no dummy. He seems like a guy who would have been successful regardless\u201d of whether he ever played pro football.\n\nOnyemata figures he should be at least as productive this season as he\u2019s ever been, if not more so.\n\n\u201cYou never stop learning,\u201d Onyemata said, adding that his raised expectations stem from \u201cunderstanding things better, being in the game longer.\u201d\n\nNotes: WR Tedd Ginn Jr. returned to practice after missing Wednesday with an illness. \u2026 DT Mario Edwards (hamstring), T Ryan Ramczyk (thigh), DT Sheldon Rankins (Achilles), LB Craig Robertson (hamstring), and S Marcus Williams (groin) were all limited in practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saints defensive tackle David Onyemata has returned from suspension not a moment too soon for New Orleans' defensive front.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/saints_onyemata_football_83092_c0-241-2769-1855_s1770x1032.jpg?f3233bdde16581443523f781e26cbf622a3553cd", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
