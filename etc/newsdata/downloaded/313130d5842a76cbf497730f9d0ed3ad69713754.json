Add Interest\n\nNearly 50,000 union workers walked off their jobs on Sunday night, starting a nationwide strike at General Motors.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, GM Canada said it had \"seen a disruption of our vehicle assembly work at the Oshawa Assembly Plant due to the UAW strike.\" The Associated Press reported that over a thousand workers have been temporarily laid off the GM plant in Oshawa, Canada, as a result of the strike.\n\nBryan Woolston/Reuters\n\n\"We plan to resume these operations as quickly as possible upon resolution of the UAW strike,\u201d the statement added.\n\nBack stateside, a local UAW union chapter 699 in Saginaw, Michigan, shared a message from their president warning of possible temporary layoffs in the coming days from GM supplier Nexteer Automotive, which makes steering systems, \"due to the disruption in GM production.\"\n\n\"As a Tier 1 supplier to GM, we have been monitoring the UAW-GM situation carefully to evaluate the potential impacts to our company. Without an imminent resolution, Nexteer faces the difficult conclusion that we must temporarily reduce our workforce in the coming days due to the disruption in GM production,\" the statement shared by union leader Tom Hurst said.\n\nJ.d. Pooley/Getty Images\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation and work to minimize the impact to our employees. Our goal is to return to full production as quickly as possible. We will also continue to update employees if the situation changes or as we learn more,\" the statement added.\n\nAndrew Rickerman, a spokesperson for the automotive technology and systems supplier Denso, told ABC News the impact on their production for GM will be determined by how long it will take to \"reach a compromise\" as the strike continues.\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and remain hopeful that both sides will find an agreeable resolution soon,\u201d Rickerman said in a statement. \u201cThe impact on our production for GM will be determined by how long it takes to reach a compromise. As always, we will adjust our production schedules based on customer release schedules.\u201d\n\nNegotiations are currently in their fifth day, and tensions heightened after it was revealed that health coverage for striking workers will no longer be covered by GM earlier this week.\n\nRebecca Cook/Reuters\n\nUnion leaders have argued that GM workers deserved a bigger slice of the company's profits, which they say have totaled $35 billion in North America over the last three years. Union members are calling for higher wages, retention of a health insurance plan in which workers pay about 4% of the costs, an improved pension plan and assurances that GM -- the makers of Buick, Cadillac, GMC and Chevrolet -- will not close four plants in Maryland, Ohio and Michigan.\n\n\"The offer we presented to the UAW prioritizes employees, communities and builds a stronger future for all,\" GM said in a tweet. \"It includes improved wages and health care benefits, over $7B in U.S. investments and 5,400 jobs.\"", "description": "The United Auto Workers strike at GM has waned on for nearly a full work week as of Friday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/gm-auto-workers-strike-01-rt-jef-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
