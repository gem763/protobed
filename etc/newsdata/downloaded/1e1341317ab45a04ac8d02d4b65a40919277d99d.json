Before Lukaku, the last Inter player to score four or more in his first four away Serie A games was Diego Milito in November 2009 \u2014 the season in which Milito led Inter to the Champions League title.\n\nFilip Djuricic and Jeremie Boga scored late for Sassuolo after Inter had gone ahead 4-1.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
