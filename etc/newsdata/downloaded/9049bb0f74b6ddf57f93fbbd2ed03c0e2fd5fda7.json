USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The military dog credited in the raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has returned to duty after treatment \u2013 and presumably treats \u2013 after suffering minor wounds in the operation.\n\nArmy Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, refused to release the dog's name for security reasons.\n\n\"The dog is still in theater,\" Milley explained to reporters Monday at a Pentagon briefing.\n\nThe military's top officer credited the hound's \"tremendous service\" and said it (gender wasn't released, either) was slightly wounded in the operation to take down the leader of ISIS, the terrorist organization.\n\nWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019\n\nThe dog is a Belgian Malinois, a breed favored by the military for sensitive missions, according to a Defense Department official not authorized to speak publicly. A Belgian Malinois accompanied Navy SEALs on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nVideo to come? Trump says portions of video of raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi could be released\n\nThe dog accompanied a force of U.S. special operators who located and tracked al-Baghdadi at his compound in northwest Syria, about four miles from the border with Turkey, Milley said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said al-Baghdadi killed himself by detonating a suicide vest after being trapped in a tunnel. Trump lamented that the dog was wounded in the operation.\n\n\u201cOur canine, I call it a dog, a beautiful dog \u2013 a talented dog \u2013 was injured and brought back,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhat's next for ISIS? What happens to ISIS now, and other things to know following al-Baghdadi's death\n\nAlso at Monday's briefing, Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper provided a few more details about the raid:\n\nThe military captured two adult male associates of al-Baghdadi and have them in custody.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's remains were removed and positively identified by DNA at a secure facility. His remains were disposed of properly, Milley said without elaborating.\n\nVideo of the raid, which Trump referred to Sunday in his briefing, is being reviewed and portions of it may be released. It is not clear if the dog had been outfitted with a camera.\n\nAl-Baghdadi died \"whimpering, screaming and crying,\" Trump said Sunday. Trump may have been relying on reports from troops who took part in the raid for those accounts, Milley said.\n\nEsper called his death a \"devastating blow\" to ISIS, which at its height controlled an area the size of Great Britain in Iraq and Syria.\n\nISIS remains a threat: ISIS leader is dead, but his Islamic State terrorist group is alive with means to thrive\n\nA Belgian Malinois similar to Dasty, here with Army Specialist Justin Coletti of US Forces Afghanistan K-9 combat tracker team in Kandalay village, Kandahar province in Aug. 5, 2011 helped in the raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
