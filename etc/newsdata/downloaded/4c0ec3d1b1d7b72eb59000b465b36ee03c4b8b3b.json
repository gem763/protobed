(AP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d A new bulletproof memorial to Emmett Till was dedicated Saturday in Mississippi after previous historical markers were repeatedly vandalized.\n\nThe brutal slaying of the 14-year-old black teenager helped spur the civil rights movement more than 60 years ago.\n\nThe 14-year-old African American teen was kidnapped, beaten and killed in 1955, hours after he was accused of whistling at a white woman. His body was found in a river days later. An all-white jury in Mississippi acquitted two white men of murder charges.\n\nPatrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, said the new marker was dedicated Saturday.\n\nMembers of Till's family, including two of Till's cousins, attended the ceremony at the site where the teen's body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River.\n\nThis is the fourth historical marker at the site. Previous ones became a target for vandals.\n\nFILE - This undated file photo shows Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black Chicago boy, whose body was found in the Tallahatchie River near the Delta community of Money, Miss., Aug. 31, 1955. The Greenwood Commonwealth reports that a new historical marker was dedicated Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019, with members of Till's family in attendance. This is the fourth historical marker at the site. The first was thrown in the river. The second and third signs were shot at and became riddled with bullet holes. (AP Photo, File) More\n\nThe first historical marker was placed in 2008. Someone tossed it in the river. The second and third signs were shot at and left riddled with bullet holes.\n\nThe new 500-pound (225-kilogram) steel sign has a glass bulletproof front, Weems said.\n\nWeems said the markers were placed as an attempt to acknowledge the truth of what happened there and hopefully spark \"new conversations.\"\n\n\"For 50 years nobody talked about Emmett Till,\" Weems said.\n\n\"I think we just have to be resilient and know there are folks out there that don't want to know this history or who want to erase the history. We are just going to be resilient in continuing to put them back up and be truthful in making make sure that Emmett didn't die in vain.\"\n\nTwo of Till's cousins, the Rev. Wheeler Parker and Ollie Gordon, attended Saturday's ceremony, Weems said.", "description": "A new bulletproof memorial to Emmett Till was dedicated Saturday in Mississippi after previous historical markers were repeatedly vandalized.
