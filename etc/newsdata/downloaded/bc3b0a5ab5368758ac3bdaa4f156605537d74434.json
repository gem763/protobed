I\u2019ll be thinking that person sure is staring at me and wonder \u2018Do I have something in my teeth?\u2019 and then I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh wait, no! I look like a giant pink blob,\u201d Katie says.\n\n\u201cI always ask my friends if they mind if I dress up because the staring can be anxiety-inducing for people not accustomed to it.\u201d\n\nThe 27-year-old reveals that she spends up to $200 (R2 800) on makeup a month, Daily Mail reports.\n\n\u201cI spend around one-and-a-half to two hours getting ready.\n\n\u201cI like to spend a lot of time on makeup because in my opinion, I\u2019m not very good at it, so that\u2019s what takes the most time other than affixing bows and clips to my head in a sort of Tetris-like arrangement,\u201d she says.\n\nKatie added that she often gets stopped in the street by people who want to take her picture.\n\n\u201cPeople take a lot of pictures but I don\u2019t really mind because I like taking pictures too. If I saw someone who looked like me on the street I would want to take a picture too because it would be so unbelievable.\u201d\n\nKatie, who has more than 68 000 followers on Instagram, hopes to appear in Vogue one day.\n\nSources: Daily Mail, Mirror News, The Sun", "description": "This young woman has spent loads of money to look like her favourite anime character.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9528/484cb102b76f42d792b2ff03f08037f0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
