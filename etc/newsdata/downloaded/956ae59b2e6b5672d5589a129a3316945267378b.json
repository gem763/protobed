It has grown to include nearly 200 entries.\n\nHOW DOES ICE BATTLE SANCTUARY CITIES?\n\n\u201cEven as extremists continue to use symbols that may be years or decades old, they regularly create new symbols, memes and slogans to express their hateful sentiments,\u201d Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.\n\nSome of the new entries started as trolling campaigns or hateful memes on internet message boards such as 4chan, 8chan and Reddit, before migrating to Facebook, Twitter and other mainstream platforms, and to public forums and fliers.\n\nThe ADL has updated its database to include the \u201cOK\u201d hand symbol, which became fodder for a 4chan trolling campaign to dupe viewers into thinking the fingers formed the letters \u201cW\u2033 and \u201cP\u2033 to mean \u201cwhite power.\u201d But the ADL says extremists also are using it as a sincere expression of white supremacy.\n\nBrenton Tarrant, the Australian man charged with killing 51 people at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, flashed the \u201cOK\u201d symbol during a courtroom appearance after his arrest. Tarrant also had the number 14 written on his rifle, a possible reference to the \u201c14 Words,\u201d a white supremacist slogan, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nOren Segal, director of the ADL\u2019s Center on Extremism, said context is key to interpreting whether an \u201cOK\u201d symbol is hateful or harmless. He said the ADL had been reluctant to add it to the database \u201cbecause \u2018OK\u2019 has meant just \u2018OK\u2019 for so long.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point, there is enough of a volume of use for hateful purposes that we felt it was important to add,\u201d Segal said.\n\nAn earlier addition to the database was Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that became hijacked by online extremists who superimposed the frog with Nazi symbols and other hateful imagery. The ADL branded Pepe as a hate symbol in September 2016 and supported cartoonist Matt Furie\u2019s efforts to reclaim the character he created.\n\nThe \u201cHappy Merchant,\u201d one of the new database entries, is an anti-Semitic meme that depicts a stereotypical image of a bearded Jewish man rubbing his hands together. Another addition, the \u201cMoon Man\u201d meme, is derived from \u201cMac Tonight,\u201d a character in a McDonald\u2019s advertising campaign during the 1980s. Internet trolls transformed the sunglasses-wearing cartoon moon into a vehicle for rap songs with racist and violent lyrics.\n\nThe ADL also added the \u201cDylann Roof Bowlcut,\u201d an image of the hairstyle worn by the white supremacist who shot and killed nine black people in 2015 at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nRoof\u2019s bowl-style hair became an avatar for extremists, including a Washington, D.C., man whose relatives contacted the FBI to report concerns about his behavior and far-right extremist rhetoric after last year\u2019s Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. Jeffrey Clark\u2019s username on the Gab social media platform was \u201cDC Bowl Gang,\u201d an FBI agent wrote in a court filing for gun charges against Clark.\n\nLogos of white nationalist groups including the Rise Above Movement and the American Identity Movement also are among the new ADL database entries.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe recently formed American Identity Movement is the successor to the now-dissolved Identity Evropa, which frequently plastered its white nationalist propaganda on college campuses and is one of the groups that has been sued over the violence that erupted at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia , in August 2017.\n\nFour members of the California-based Rise Above Movement pleaded guilty this year to attacking counterprotesters at the Charlottesville rally. A federal judge sentenced three of them to prison terms ranging from 27 months to 37 months.", "description": "The \u201cOK\u201d hand gesture, a mass killer\u2019s bowl-style haircut and an anthropomorphic moon wearing sunglasses are among 36 new entries in a Jewish civil rights group\u2019s online database of hate symbols used by white supremacists and other far-right extremists.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
