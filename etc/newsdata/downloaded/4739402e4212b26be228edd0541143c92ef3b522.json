But at the new Al Janoub Stadium, the world\u2019s first purpose-built air conditioned football ground, it was a pleasant 70F in the stands and on the pitch, even at the hottest point of the day.\n\nWatching the bemused looks from English journalists was Dr Saud Abdul Ghani, the Sudan-born mechanical engineer behind the groundbreaking air cooling technology that will also be used at the world athletics championships when they begin on Friday and at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nMigrant workers and children to pad out crowd for World Athletics Championships Read more\n\n\u201cYou are living inside a controlled micro-climate bubble,\u201d he explained excitedly, pointing to the tiny grills under each seat and the 170 turrets at the side of the pitch blasting out freezing air.\n\n\u201cPumping out cold air is a bit crude,\u201d he continued, making a \u201cpfft!\u201d sound like a magician, \u201cand then God will just make that disappear. So, we pump the exact amount of cold air in the exact place and then recycle it all the time. We never throw it away. There are grills on the floor. We take it from the top and recycle it back.\u201d\n\nGhani, who is known locally as Dr Cool, then pointed to the seats. \u201cIf you look at the diffuser underneath you, you can see funny angles. This has been designed for the air to miss you and not to hit you, hug you gently and engulf you. Make a bubble!\u201d\n\nThe temperature in the stadium can be brought down to as low as 44F, although the irony is that while the technology was designed to let Qatar host a summer World Cup, it will not necessarily be needed in November and December when the temperatures are much cooler. However Ghani believes it will stop the stadiums becoming white elephants once the tournament is over.\n\n\u201cThis air-conditioned stadium will be used as women\u2019s clubs, kids\u2019 clubs, recreation areas for people to have events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any white elephants where you play a game every month and then the stadium is shut. We want these to be magnets for the community as a legacy case.\u201d\n\nGhani would not divulge the cost of the system but admitted it led to the stadiums being two to three times more expensive than would otherwise be the case. And he pointed out the technology would most likely be rolled out globally in the future. \u201cThe Chinese will be very interested because they have their Olympic Games coming, as will the Americans and Mexicans. And with global warming \u2013 Paris and London were over 100F \u2013 even Europeans need to look at this carefully.\u201d", "description": "Dr Saud Abdul Ghani\u2019s groundbreaking air-conditioned stadiums to be used in 2022 World Cup and world athletics championships starting on Friday", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09cb004310c7766e740e531dfe8bcdbba6eadcde/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e021d97015cbfaaeed5da9f2292d34b", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
