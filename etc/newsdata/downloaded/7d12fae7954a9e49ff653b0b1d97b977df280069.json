Users program the garbage pick up schedule into the app and input the distance between the two docking stations - one near the home and the other by the road. SmartCan autonomously rolls out to the curb when it is garbage day. It then returns after it has been emptied.\n\nNow, SmartCan, developed by the firm Rezzi, eliminates the need for homeowners to drag their garbage cans to the curb by providing a motorized trash can attachment and corresponding mobile app.\n\nUsers can set the specific day and time they need their trash to be at the curb for pickup, and the SmartCan attachment will get it there autonomously.\n\nOnce picked up by collectors, the robotic trash can heads back to its base after sensing the vertical movement.\n\n'We want to help people eliminate unnecessary chores from their daily lives,' said Rezzi CEO and SmartCan creator Andrew Murray.\n\n'We see an opportunity to take IoT beyond just turning off lights or turning on music, and really help alleviate the burden of the mundane physical tasks that everyone faces.\n\n'Rezzi is looking to build on the progress of notable smart home and IoT companies to do our part in redefining this consumer landscape.'\n\nThe need for these devices means the garbage can may only survive in suburban areas \u2013 there may be too much foot traffic and other elements in cities that could damage the docking stations.\n\nUsers can set the specific day and time they need their trash to be at the curb for pickup via that companion app, and the SmartCan attachment will get it there autonomously\n\nSmartCan rolls out to a docking station along the curb and autonomously returns once the garbage has been picked up\n\nThe firm is set to release SmartCan to the market sometime late next year.\n\nAnother smart garbage can is also helping people doing chores.\n\nCalled the Bruno Smartcan, this device is said to the be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner.\n\nThe need for these devices means the garbage can may only survive in suburban areas \u2013 there may be too much foot traffic and other elements in cities that could damage the docking stations\n\nUsing sensors on the front of the bin, it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush, turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess.\n\nBruno comes with an integrated bag dispenser that additionally sends alerts to a smartphone when the owner is getting low on bags, and it can send reminders when it is time to take out the rubbish.\n\nAnother smart garbage can is also helping people doing chores. Called the Bruno Smartcan (pictured), this device is said to the be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner\n\nDeveloped by inventors Jim Howard and Lori Montag, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, the bin is able to clean up dog hair and spilt breakfast cereal and crumbs, sucking it up directly into the bin bag.\n\nIt also features a motion sensitive hands-free lid that opens automatically.\n\nThe inventors said: 'Bruno and its patents pending technologies have been many months in the making.\n\n'The powerful vortex vacuum feature will deliver every dog hair, cheerio and grain of dirt directly into the trash bag.\n\n'No more stopping, no more scooping, just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and Bruno will do the rest.\n\n'Bruno will also remind you to take the trash out on trash day, and alert you when you are low on Bruno Bags.'\n\nThe pair is hoping to attract support for their invention on Kickstarter.\n\nThey said the Bruno 'smartcan' can run for 30 days on its battery before needing to be recharged.\n\nAn extendable recharging cord is built into a flip up section just behind the main lid.\n\nUsers can buy custom-fitted bags for the Bruno, which fit into its dispenser, or use standard bin bags.\n\nThe bin has a capacity of 59 liters (13 gallons).", "description": "Most dread taking out the garbage -- but not this robot.
