We have to take the flags and tee markers in at night so they don't eat them anymore'\n\nMr Rossouw, from Skukuza, South Africa, said: 'I would go as far to say Skukuza is the wildest golf course in the whole world.\n\n'The hyenas eat the flags and the elephants damage the trees. We have to take the flags and tee markers in at night so they don't eat them anymore.\n\n'My job as green keeper is to drive around in the early mornings to see what's on the golf course.\n\n'I'm on the course all day and I'm driving up and down to make sure there's no dangerous animals near the people, so it's fairly safe.\n\n'I found lions on the course this morning around 6.30am and chased them off with the vehicle. If you come across them you do get a bit of a fright, but they also get a fright.\n\n'I turned around and got a vehicle to drive in because you don't want to face them head to head with a golf cart.\n\n'I also checked what the elephants damaged the night before because they knock down the trees.\n\nThe grass of the green attracts mischievous leopards, lions, hyenas, elephants and giraffes - who often eat the equipment for a midnight snack\n\nMr Rossouw added: 'I'm on the course all day and I'm driving up and down to make sure there's no dangerous animals near the people, so it's fairly safe'\n\nGiraffes are also known to roam freely around the fenceless course, which is situated in the middle of Kruger National Park - home to hundreds of thousands of wild animals\n\nHerds of elephants are known to knock down trees and flags on the course while they run around and walk through water\n\n'We've also got the whole Big Five and other animals on the course - lions, leopards, hyenas, elephants.'\n\nMr Rossouw has worked at the course for five years and proudly admits there isn't any other course 'with the same amount of dangerous animals' anywhere in the world.\n\nBut while the wildlife descend on the course at night and get up to mischief, they are most often spotted sunbathing lazily under trees by day.\n\nMr Rossouw said: 'I think the weirdest thing is we live amongst them. It's a great feature of them being around.\n\nMr Rossouw has worked at the course for five years and proudly admits there isn't any other course 'with the same amount of dangerous animals' anywhere in the world\n\nBut while the wildlife descend on the course at night and get up to mischief, they are most often spotted sunbathing lazily under trees by day. Pictured are dung beetles in the dirt of the course\n\nOne golfer died at the park in 2014, when he was attacked by a crocodile while he tried to retrieve lost golf balls from a dam called Lake Panic\n\n'It's incredible seeing them at any time of day.\n\n'It's quite nice having them around here and is part of what makes the course unique.\n\n'I don't think there's any other course with the same amount of dangerous animals anywhere in the whole world.\n\n'People love to encounter them on the course which is why they come to experience that.\n\nMr Rossouw said: 'I think the weirdest thing is we live amongst them.

The animals do tend to keep their distance and they're often scared of people.\n\n'But we've got a card and number so we do give it to the people and tell them if they see anything on the course to please phone and let the pro shop know.\n\n'We don't have any fences around here, so the animals can be around whenever they like. They come and go but they tend to keep their distance.\n\n'We get quite a few of these incursions happening over time, but nothing's happened with any tourists yet. Whenever they see people they tend to move off.'", "description": "Green keeper Jean Rossouw, 29, is forced to chase off lions, elephants and boar at the Skukuza Golf Course in Kruger National Park, South Africa.", "authors": ["Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20318932-0-image-a-2_1572344441419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
