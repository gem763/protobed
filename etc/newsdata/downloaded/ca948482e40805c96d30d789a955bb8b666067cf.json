The suspect, in his early 40s, was part of a unit that arrested people following a demonstration in the city of Douma and took them to the Branch 251 prison, where they were severely mistreated.\n\nThe men were allegedly members of Syria\u2019s General Intelligence Directorate until they left the country in late 2012 and early 2013. Both men later came to Germany, where they were arrested in February.\n\nThe European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights called the case \u201can important step in the fight against impunity.\u201d\n\nThe Berlin-based group, which helps victims of abuse in Syria and elsewhere, said the case was the result of a series of criminal complaints submitted over the past three years by almost 50 Syrian torture survivors, relatives, activists, and lawyers in Germany, Austria and Sweden.\n\nFive of the torture victims plan to join the trial as co-plaintiffs, as allowed under German law.\n\nPatrick Kroker, a lawyer representing three of the victims, said his clients were politically active in Syria in some form, mostly by participating in protests against the Assad government or documenting them, before they were imprisoned and tortured at Branch 251.\n\n\u201cThey hope this trial will achieve something beyond their individual cases,\u201d Kroker told The Associated Press. \u201cThey want to show that these weren\u2019t isolated incidents and that such crimes are still taking place today.\u201d\n\nThe trial is expected to begin early next year in the western German city of Koblenz.", "description": "German prosecutors said Tuesday they have charged two suspected former members of Syria's secret police with crimes against humanity.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176003359-e1572356297276-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
