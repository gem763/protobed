(Photo credit: Aarthi Swaminathan/Yahoo Finance) More\n\nAs President Donald Trump hammers out a partial trade deal with China, there\u2019s another front that\u2019s gotten far less attention: India.\n\nThe two economies have been battling each for more than a year, with tensions rising in June after the president removed key Indian trade preferences. Since then, both governments have moved toward a reconciliation, with most hopeful that a deal will come sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cI think good progress has been made,\u201d Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview in New York. \u201cI see a good possibility of a good trade deal with the U.S. soon.\u201d\n\nThe Finance Minister\u2019s visit comes on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s big U.S. tour where he met President Trump, attended a rally for Indians in Houston, Texas and later the United Nations General Assembly. Modi\u2019s big pitch for India was that the country was ready for \u2014 and was eagerly seeking \u2014 foreign investment, and that it had embarked on business-friendly reforms to support that.\n\nTrade tensions simmer\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump participates in the \"Howdy Modi\" event with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Houston, Texas in September 2019.

The preferential trade treatment had allowed India to export certain products duty-free. India has been the biggest beneficiary of the program that dates back to the 1970s.\n\nIn addition, Trump imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on India in 2018. India requested an exemption from Washington, only to have it refused.\n\nThat prompted Modi to retaliate, slapping higher tariffs on 28 U.S. products, including almonds, apples and walnuts.\n\nStill, Modi\u2019s visit last month seemed to suggest that a trade deal \u2014albeit a limited one \u2014 was coming soon, a sentiment echoed by Sitharaman.\n\n\u201cEach country has its national priorities and putting your national priorities on the top \u2026 guiding a trade talk is not a bad thing at all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut talks are happening. I'm sure things will get resolved.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s list of grievances\n\nAside from steel, the White House has raised a litany of additional grievances with India. Earlier this month, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross commented that India is \u201cif not the most protectionist, certainly one of the most protectionist.\u201d Ross is also concerned about India\u2019s regulatory changes that favor domestic companies over foreign ones, such as in the case with Walmart and Mastercard.\n\nUnder current rules, India doesn\u2019t allow companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart-owned (WMT) Flipkart to sell products from companies they have an equity interest in. The policy was implemented by Modi back in May.\n\n\u201cAmerican companies are showing goodwill and cooperative attitude towards Make in India and the other programs, but there is a limit to the discriminatory [behavior],\u201d Ross told CNBC-TV18.", "description": "As U.S. President Donald Trump hammers out a partial trade deal with China, Washington is moving forward on another front: India.", "authors": ["Aarthi Swaminathan", "Akiko Fujita"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3czmXCX73Ip6s.Rdd5qMGg--~B/aD0yNTMzO3c9MzkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0de82c80-f045-11e9-aff9-6dbb08bfda6d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
