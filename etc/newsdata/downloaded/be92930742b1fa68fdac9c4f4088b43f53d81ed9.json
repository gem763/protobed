[Emphasis added] Before the trial started last month, the defendant\u2019s legal team filed a motion to exclude any \u201creference to, or insinuation concerning the status or nature of Ernesto Esquivel-Garcia\u2019s immigration or citizenship status\u201d due to its potential \u201charmful effect\u201d and its \u201chighly prejudicial content.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\nAs Bensman notes, Gonzales received about $1 million in campaign cash from billionaire George Soros during his run for District Attorney in 2018.\n\n\u201cIn our situation, when we were trying to put all of this together, we met obstacles and roadblocks one after another,\u201d Jared\u2019s aunt, Cristin Vargas, told Bensman. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know why this happened to Jared.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Jared\u2019s murder, Esquivel-Garcia had already been twice released from police and federal custody back into the U.S. and was only given a voluntary deportation order despite having a criminal record.\n\nIn March 2017, the illegal alien was arrested for drunk driving and was eventually turned over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Though he was placed into deportation proceedings, an immigration judge allowed him to post bond, and he was released back into the interior of the country.\n\nIn May 2018, a month before Vargas was murdered, Esquivel-Garcia was again put into ICE custody and local police custody but was able to post bond and be released back into the U.S. with only the promise that he would self-deport.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand why he was able to get arrested and get released and get arrested and then get released,\u201d Cristin told Bensman. \u201cBased on our understanding of the law he should have been deported before all this happened.\u201d\n\nVargas, a cybersecurity student at the University of Texas at San Antonio, was found murdered by Esquivel-Garcia on June 18, 2018, when firefighters arrived at the scene of an apartment set ablaze.\n\nProsecutors said the illegal alien had brutally strangled and stabbed Vargas to death before setting his body on fire in the apartment complex. Throughout the trial, Esquivel-Garcia and his attorneys had used a defense and smear against Vargas to justify the murder, claiming that the illegal alien killed Vargas in self-defense because he believed that he was under threat of being sexually assaulted.\n\nJared Vargas leaves behind his twin brother, in college, and a little sister, in high school, as well as his parents and countless loved ones and friends. A GoFundMe page has been set up in his honor to help his twin brother and little sister in their schooling.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
