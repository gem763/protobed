Adam Schiff, D-Calif., should be impeached over their handling of the whistleblower investigation.\n\nTrump said Pelosi was aware of \"Shifty Adam Schiff\" and his \"massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people.\u201d Trump pointed to Schiff's \u201cparody\u201d speech in Congress. Pelosi defended the speech and called it \u201cfair.\u201d\n\nTrump was also apparently eluding to reports that Schiff's false earlier claim that the unnamed whistleblower did not speak to his committee.\n\nSchiff read a dramatization of Trump's July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's hearing last week. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intellegence Committee, improvised parts of the transcript for effect and framed it as satire.\n\nDEMS BELIEVE THEY HAVE ENOUGH VOTES\n\nTrump has been under an impeachment investigation over his interaction Zelensky after it was revealed that he requested that Kiev investigate the Bidens.\n\nTrump said his call with Zelensky was \"perfect.\" Zelensky said he felt no pressure.\n\nBut Democrats\u2014led by Schiff\u2014claim Trump withheld essential military funding from Kiev as part of quid pro quo to get dirt on a political opponent.\n\nTrump is attempting to frame the probe as another \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and has pointed to the Mueller investigation as an example of an earlier Democratic fishing expedition.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi knew of all the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with highly partisan \u201cwhistleblower\u201d & lawyer,\" he tweeted. \"This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201ccolluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately impeached!\u201d\n\nTrump has recently also called for the impeachment of Sen. Mitt Romney.\n\nArticle I, Section 5 of the Constitution allows both the House and Senate to set its own rules. No lawmaker may be \u201cimpeached.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIt states that either body may expel a member, provided there is a 2/3 vote. The House has only expelled five members in history. The Senate has expelled 15. The President has no role in the matter as the legislative branch is in control of its own members.\n\nFox News\u2019 Chad Pergram contributed to this report", "description": "President Trump on Sunday tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep.
