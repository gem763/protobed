REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer\n\nShaw succeeded Clete Willems as deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs and deputy director of the National Economic Council earlier this year.\n\nShe served as the U.S. \u201csherpa\u201d for the G7 and G20 and was part of the team advising the president during trade talks between the United States and China, which led Trump to announce the outlines of a \u201cphase one\u201d pact with Beijing on Oct. 11.\n\nShaw will leave her post on Friday. An administration official said she was going to the private sector, but did not specify where. Shaw declined to comment on her next move.\n\n\u201cIt just felt like the right time to go for me,\u201d Shaw told Reuters, noting she had worked in the federal government for 10 years and only intended to stay for three. \u201cI am ready for my next and new adventure.\u201d\n\nHer departure comes as the National Security Council, for which she also worked, is being slimmed down. Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, plans to reduce the size of the NSC by about a third in the coming months and limit its role in foreign policy. The international economics portfolio will be managed by NEC Director Larry Kudlow.\n\n\u201cKelly Ann has had a distinguished legal and government career in trade policy and has played a key role in implementing the administration\u2019s trade and economic agenda,\u201d Kudlow said in a statement. \u201cShe will be missed.\u201d\n\nAsked who would replace Shaw, the administration official said the White House did not have an announcement at this time.\n\nThe United States and China are trying to finalize the first phase of a trade agreement for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign in November on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile.\n\n\u201cWe are working to see if we\u2019ll get there by Chile,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let the negotiators do their work and see where we\u2019ll get to in a couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nWith her departure, Shaw will not be part of the official negotiating team that gets the two sides to a deal, if one is achieved.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to feel like there\u2019s work left to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got very able colleagues who will take the reins from here.\u201d\n\nThe White House faces a slew of trade deadlines before the end of the year.\n\nShaw negotiated on behalf of the United States with foreign governments ahead of summits with world leaders. She was the only woman sherpa in the G7 this year and one of two women sherpas in the G20, she said.\n\nBefore her time in the White House, she worked as trade counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means. She also worked as assistant general counsel in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington and Geneva.", "description": "President Donald Trump's G7 and trade adviser, Kelly Ann Shaw, is leaving his administration for a position in the private sector, White House officials said on Tuesday, marking the departure of one of the most senior women on the president's economic team.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443895544&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L21M", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
