Col. Alexander Vindman that key words and phrases connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son were omitted from a White House readout of a call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but he\u2019s not the only one listening to the call. There are a number of individuals listening to the call, and they put the transcript together,\u201d Mr. McCarthy, California Republican, said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if one person disagrees, it\u2019s a collective group that decides \u2014 not the president. But you know what? The rest of America and the rest of the world has seen this call \u2014 you\u2019ve read the transcript,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing impeachable about this.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times first reported that Col. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, testified to House investigators on Tuesday that he tried but failed to make corrections to a reconstructed transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\nHe said that Mr. Zelensky said the word \u201cBurisma.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to Burisma Holdings, the energy company where Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, had a lucrative seat on the board. The reconstructed transcript instead refers to \u201cthe company.\u201d\n\nCol. Vindman also said that in a part of the transcript where ellipses appear, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden, apparently referring to the candidate\u2019s threat to withhold loan guarantees to Ukraine if the country didn\u2019t fire a prosecutor who had reportedly been eyeing Burisma.\n\nMr. McCarthy also predicted that Republicans will retake control of the House and said some Democrats are coming around on impeaching Mr. Trump to head off criticism from their left flank.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, is \u201cgoing to\u201d lose the speaker\u2019s gavel, he said.\n\n\u201cIt only takes 19 seats to win the majority. They have 31 Democrats sitting in seats that President Trump carried, and we\u2019re going to carry those again,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cMore importantly here \u2014 watch the Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey now approve of impeachment every time they get a primary opponent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou watch Max Rose \u2026 who said impeachment was wrong,\u201d he said, referring to the freshman Democratic congressman from New York. \u201cNow he\u2019s changed the entire system that you\u2019re not innocent [until] proven guilty. He said the president says he\u2019s innocent \u2014 he has to prove it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
