These fields have played a critical role in financially supporting whoever controls them throughout Syria's civil war.\n\nThe fields were part of the territory controlled by the Islamic State for several years, giving the group a consistent stream of income from sales to Syrian and Turkish smugglers. The fields were eventually captured in 2017 by American-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nUS-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in formation at a ceremony to mark their defeat of Islamic State militants in Baghouz.

I don't know if Trump understands this.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday claimed the US had \"secured\" oil in Syria, but that's not strictly correct. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nKobani did not reference the oil facilities but told The New York Times that he had ordered a resumption of anti-ISIS operations in the Deir Al Zor and Abu Kamal areas of Syria after standing down such operations during the first days of the Turkish invasion of Syria.\n\nHowever, Esper told reporters on his Afghanistan trip that some US troops could remain along the Iraq-Syria border to help the Kurds fight ISIS and maintain control over the oil fields.\n\nEsper said that despite the flurry of social-media statements by all sides, options were being presented to Trump for a final decision.\n\n\"Trump is changing his mind again and it looks like his people reminded him about the million dollars a day in revenue those fields produce for whomever controls them,\" a Western military official who works closely with the anti-ISIS coalition in Syria said. The official, who was not authorized to speak with the media, asked not to be named.\n\n\"It's clear the military guys want to keep at least some units inside Syria despite Trump's loud pronouncements they would leave, and while arguments about US loyalty to allies or geopolitical effects have failed, it seems like they're reminding him about the oil,\" the official said.\n\n\"He understands money better than geopolitics, so this is the argument they're using to keep some sort of presence.\"\n\nRead more: Trump's 'great for everybody' cease-fire deal in Syria gives Turkey everything it wants in exchange for virtually nothing\n\nThe oil fields in question were attacked by government forces and hundreds of Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group in February 2018, but the operation was thwarted by heavy US air support backing the SDF, which killed hundreds of Syrian troops and their advisers.\n\nThe Arab fighter for the SDF in Deir Al Zor said that for now his units were begrudgingly willing to cooperate with the US troops if the plan to base them along the Iraqi border and in the oil fields were finalized.\n\n\"We know the regime and Russians want these fields, and we can't let them cross the [Euphrates] river [from the West] or they will take control of the fields,\" he said.\n\n\"The people of Deir Al Zor do not want to live under [Syrian President Bashar] Assad and we no longer trust the Americans. But maybe we can trust Trump to want his hands on the oil. I just don't know how long he will protect us.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump on Sunday said the US \"secured\" Syria's eastern oil fields.
