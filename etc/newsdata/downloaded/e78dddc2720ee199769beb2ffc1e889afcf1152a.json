She\u2019s left a family in complete ruin. We\u2019re broken.\u2019\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed on August 27 in a car crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire\n\nLondon and Washington were locked in an extraordinary standoff last night over the issue. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been urging US ambassador Woody Johnson and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to reconsider their protection for Mrs Sacoolas.\n\nHowever a Foreign Office source said Mr Pompeo gave no indication that the US would back down. Boris Johnson, who insists Mrs Sacoolas must return to Britain, will challenge Donald Trump if there is no progress within 48 hours.\n\nMrs Sacoolas is wanted for questioning over the fatal crash involving her Volvo and Harry\u2019s motorcycle\n\nMrs Charles said: \u2018This supposed amazing relationship with the US needs to be used to its full potential.\u2019\n\nMrs Sacoolas is wanted for questioning over the fatal crash involving her Volvo and Harry\u2019s motorcycle outside an RAF base in Northamptonshire. Police say she was on the wrong side of the road.\n\nIn other developments:It emerged that Mrs Sacoolas has a driving conviction in the US;\n\nNorthamptonshire Police said they had no idea how and when she fled;\n\nWashington was accused of hypocrisy because it had succeeded in having immunity revoked in criminal cases involving foreign diplomats posted in the US;\n\nAnd last year Britain rescinded the immunity of a UK diplomat\u2019s husband so he could be charged with domestic violence.\n\nHarry, who worked at a petrol station, was on his way to his father\u2019s house in Brackley, Northants, when the collision happened outside RAF Croughton, a US intelligence hub. The teeanger, who had clocked up 50,000 miles on motorcycles, suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital.\n\nHis grieving mother Charlotte Charles said Anne Sacoolas, 42, must answer questions over the death of Harry. Mrs Charles spoke on CBS This Morning alongside Harry's father, Tim Dunn\n\nMrs Sacoolas, who had her 12-year-old son in the car, was spoken to by police the following day \u2013 August 28 \u2013 and said she had no plans to leave the UK.\n\nOfficers became aware immunity was an issue because her husband was a diplomat and applied to the US embassy for a waiver to allow them to question her.\n\nBut they were later informed the waiver had been refused and Mrs Sacoolas had left the country.\n\nMrs Charles, who works in a GP surgery, said: \u2018The police had the CCTV footage showing she pulled out of the RAF base onto the wrong side of the road.\n\n\u2018Harry had no chance of avoiding her. She travelled from around 350 to 400 yards on the wrong side of the road. It was a head-on collision. We later lost him in hospital.\u2019\n\nSpy base was named in Snowden leaks RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire is one of the largest American intelligence hubs outside the United States. Originally set up to co-ordinate an attack by US nuclear bombers, it has evolved into a relay hub for some of Washington\u2019s most sensitive material, including CIA communications. Both military personnel and diplomats \u2013 with diplomatic immunity \u2013 operate inside the top-secret facility, along with British spies. The base is under the supervision of an RAF commander and a small team whose job it is to ensure that UK law is not breached. Employees at the base include spies working for the US Joint Intelligence Operations Center Europe, which is part of the Defense Intelligence Agency \u2013 the Pentagon\u2019s main military espionage service. In 2013 the base was named in documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden as playing a key support role in embassy-based spying. US bases in the UK are governed by a 1950s agreement with Washington. RAF sources said they were not able to discuss what work the US carries out there.\n\nHarry\u2019s father Tim Dunn, who is separated from Mrs Charles, added: \u2018She was compliant with the police, she admitted at the time she was in the wrong.\u2019\n\nMrs Charles said the family would travel to Washington if necessary to fight for justice for Harry, who had a twin brother Niall.\n\nShe said she just wanted to speak to Mrs Sacoolas \u2018as a mum\u2019, adding: \u2018We\u2019re not a horrible family. We\u2019re a usual UK family that just need to put a face to what we have now as a name.\n\n\u2018Talk to her, find out how she\u2019s feeling. She\u2019s got to be suffering as well \u2013 she\u2019s a mum.\n\n\u2018Without knowing who this person is properly, we can\u2019t begin to try and start our grieving process.\u2019\n\nA source who is familiar with Mr Raab\u2019s call to Mr Pompeo said: \u2018The Foreign Secretary reiterated our position, expressed disappointment with the US decision and urged him to reconsider.\u2019\n\nIt is understood that US officials fear that handing Mrs Sacoolas over would set a dangerous precedent. More than 450 US diplomats in the UK have immunity.\n\nBritish officials point out that the UK has been willing to waive immunity in serious cases including that of Youssef Amroche, the 37-year-old husband of a British diplomat in New York.\n\nHe was accused of beating his wife, who worked as a secretary to the UK ambassador to the United Nations, at their apartment in December.\n\nPolice arrested Mr Amroche, a Moroccan citizen, but had to release him after being told he was protected by his wife\u2019s diplomatic immunity.\n\nRaul Contreras, a spokesman for New York City Hall, expressed gratitude to Britain when the prosecution of Mr Amroche was allowed to proceed.\n\nAnother case involved Gueorgui Makharadze, a Georgian diplomat who crashed his car into a line of vehicles in Washington in 1997, killing a teenage girl.\n\nHe was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison after the US asked Georgia to waive his immunity.\n\nHarry is pictured with is mother. Mrs Charles, who works in a GP surgery, said: \u2018Harry had no chance of avoiding her. She travelled from around 350 to 400 yards on the wrong side of the road. It was a head-on collision. We later lost him in hospital'\n\nMr Johnson said yesterday: \u2018I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country.\u2019\n\nNorthamptonshire\u2019s chief constable Nick Adderley said: \u2018We were given some assurances by the American authorities that she would co-operate fully with the police and that she would not be leaving the country. And then the next minute we found out that, actually, she and her family had left. It was really disappointing.\u2019\n\nThe US embassy in London confirmed the incident had involved a vehicle driven by the spouse of a US diplomat who had left the country. It said immunity was rarely waived.\n\nMrs Sacoolas could not be reached for comment yesterday.\n\nShe and her diplomat husband Jonathan have a \u00a3800,000 house set behind trees on a quiet street in the upmarket town of Vienna, Virginia.\n\nHarry, who worked at a petrol station, was on his way to his father\u2019s house in Brackley, Northants, when the collision happened outside RAF Croughton (pictured)\n\nUS court records show she was fined for a driving offence in November 2006. She was pulled over by traffic police on a charge of \u2018failure to pay full time and attention\u2019.\n\nShe and her husband arrived in Britain in early August, when their three children were enrolled in the \u00a319,000-a-year Winchester House school in Brackley. Harry\u2019s father is head of maintenance there.\n\nTypically, diplomatic immunity applies to US diplomats and their families only if they work at the embassy in London. But a special arrangement dating back to 1994 affords diplomats at RAF Croughton the same protection as those in the capital.\n\nStephen Mold, Northants police and crime commissioner, said there was no reason for Mrs Sacoolas not to return.\n\nHarry\u2019s family\u2019s lawyer, Radd Seiger, who is American, called on a senior US representative to visit the family and explain to them \u2018why you whisked a person who killed their son out overnight without telling anybody\u2019.", "description": "Harry Dunn, 19, was killed in August near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.
