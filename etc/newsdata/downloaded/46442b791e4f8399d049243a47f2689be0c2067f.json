REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 2% in extended trading.\n\nHurd is one of Oracle\u2019s two CEOs, the other being Safra Catz. Under their tenure, the company has tried to rapidly transition to cloud computing software.\n\nCatz and Oracle founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison will cover Hurd\u2019s responsibilities during his absence, the company statement said.\n\nHurd will continue to receive all employment benefits during his leave, Oracle said. The company did not respond to Reuters request for details on Hurd\u2019s health issue and how long his leave would last.\n\nHurd was named Oracle co-president in September 2010, a month after he was ousted in a controversial fashion from Hewlett-Packard Co, where he had been chief executive since 2005. (reut.rs/2kfZh1Z)\n\nWhen Hurd and Catz were named co-CEOs in 2014, analysts were skeptical about the move. However, cloud software giants like Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) have since also had a co-CEO structure in place.\n\n\u201cMark Hurd is a talented executive, but I don\u2019t think Oracle will act differently,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said.\n\nSeparately, Oracle reported quarterly results a day before its scheduled release. On a post-earnings call with analysts, Catz said, \u201c...as Mark will be taking a leave, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once.\u201d\n\nTotal revenue came in at $9.22 billion, missing estimates of $9.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nThe miss indicated Oracle was struggling to make inroads into the highly competitive cloud computing market dominated by the likes of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nOracle has been aggressively pushing into cloud computing to make up for a late entry into the fast-growing business that helps companies move away from the traditional and costlier on-premise model.\n\nThe company also said, assuming currency headwind, it expected second-quarter adjusted profit between 87 cents and 89 cents per share, below estimates of 91 cents per share.\n\nNet income fell to $2.14 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 31, from $2.27 billion a year earlier. On a per share basis, Oracle earned 63 cents per share from 57 cents per share, a year ago.\n\nExcluding items, Oracle earned 81 cents per share, in-line with analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nOracle also said it plans to buy back an additional $15 billion in stock.", "description": "Oracle Corp said on Wednesday Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd would be taking a medical leave, and the business software maker posted first-quarter revenue that missed Wall Street expectations.", "authors": ["Arjun Panchadar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428843882&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1T1-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
