This new lot would add 30,000 to the network called Starlink.\n\nThe ITU manages radio spectrum frequencies and satellite orbits around the world. The 20 new filings mentioned by the UIT official can be seen on its website.\n\nA SpaceX spokeswoman did not directly confirm that number but said the company \"is taking steps to responsibly scale Starlink's total network capacity and data density to meet the growth in users' anticipated needs.\"\n\nThe idea behind Starlink is that the network of mini-satellites will allow fast response time between user and internet provider.\n\nThe grid created by all these satellites will be such that several of them will be in direct sight from any point on Earth.\n\nSpaceX launched the first 60 satellites in May and says the constellation will be operational for Canada and the northern US next year.\n\nIt says it will take 24 launches for the rest of the world to be covered.\n\nTo put things into context, there are currently 2,100 active satellites orbiting our planet, out of 23,000 objects recorded. These can be rocket stages, inactive satellites, space junk and other things.\n\nThe prospect of adding another 42,000 satellites to the skies is causing worries for two reasons.\n\nOn one hand, astronomers fear these satellites will get in the way of telescope observations made from Earth.\n\nWhen a first group of satellites was launched, many astronomers reported seeing a string of bright lights. SpaceX says it is trying to make the base of the satellites black.\n\nThe second problem is crowding of low Earth obit, which is up to 2,000 km or 1,250 miles.\n\nSpaceX has said that three of the first 60 satellites it placed in orbit were out of service a month after being deployed. The company says it has ways of \"deorbiting\" faulty satellites and keeping them from colliding with other satellites.\n\nBut an incident last month showed these procedures are not yet fully effective.\n\nThe European Space Agency had to modify the trajectory of its Aeolus satellite to avoid collision with a Starlink obiter. This is a routine maneuver. However, the ESA tried to contact SpaceX and got no answer because the latter did not see the message.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "SpaceX wants spectrum access for nearly four times as many satellites as originally planned for its high-speed internet constellation, the company and a UN agency confirmed Wednesday.
