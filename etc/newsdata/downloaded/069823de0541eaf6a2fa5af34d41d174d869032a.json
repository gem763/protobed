It may be a tad stuffy for a nap.\n\nTexas officials this week produced a chart of temperatures for the room during last Saturday\u2019s game when LSU beat the Longhorns 45-38.\n\nAccording to Texas, the temp hovered from 68 degrees, at the top of the perfect range for a glass of red wine, to 75 degrees, above the optimal spectrum for a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nTexas compiled the list after LSU coach Ed Orgeron said the Tigers had been warned the air conditioning might not be on and brought their own to keep things cool on a night when the kickoff temperature was nearly 100.\n\nTexas officials say the air conditioning in the locker room works fine. The teams play again in September 2020 in Baton Rouge.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The visitor's locker room at the University of Texas appears almost perfect for serving a nice glass of wine.
