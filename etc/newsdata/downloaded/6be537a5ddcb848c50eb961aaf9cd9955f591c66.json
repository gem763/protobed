In some instances, he acted on his own, and in others his actions were in conjunction with U.S. government representatives.\n\nUkrainians seeking influence in Washington viewed him as a direct conduit to Mr. Trump. And when Mr. Giuliani\u2019s actions were in conflict with the U.S. government\u2019s national-security and foreign-policy apparatus, it was unable and at times unwilling to deter him. Some senior government officials knew little, if anything, of his work.\n\n\u201cMy only knowledge of what Mr. Giuliani does\u2014I have to be honest with you\u2014I get from the TV or the news media,\u201d said Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, in testifying before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday about the complaint. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of what he does for the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts, however, were blessed by Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani has said a handful of his dealings with Ukrainian officials were initiated by the State Department. In July, Mr. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, received a text message from Kurt Volker, the U.S. government\u2019s special representative to Ukraine. In the message, which Mr. Giuliani provided to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Volker offered to introduce Mr. Giuliani to a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cMr. Mayor\u2014really enjoyed breakfast this morning,\u201d Mr. Volker texted to Mr. Giuliani on July 19. \u201cAs discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.\u201d He suggested a three-way call the next week.\n\nMr. Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has served as an unpaid volunteer in the Ukraine post since 2017. He couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nA State Department spokesman confirmed that Mr. Volker, at Mr. Yermak\u2019s request, put Mr. Yermak in touch with Mr. Giuliani. \u201cMr. Giuliani is a private citizen and acts in a personal capacity as a lawyer for President Trump,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cHe does not speak on behalf of the U.S. Government.\u201d\n\nSix days after the text, President Trump in a phone call pressed Mr. Zelensky to pursue investigations, including a probe into the activities of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. During the call, Mr. Trump repeatedly said Mr. Zelensky should connect with Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, according to a record of the call released by the White House Wednesday. Mr. Trump has defended the phone call as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nShortly after the July 25 call, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak met in person in Madrid. In an interview Thursday, Mr. Giuliani said that he subsequently briefed the State Department and that Mr. Volker texted him: \u201cThank you very much for your help.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has characterized the impeachment probe as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by his enemies in Washington.\n\nMr. Yermak declined to comment through an intermediary.\n\nIn Ukraine, Mr. Giuliani is viewed as something of a celebrity. \u201cGiuliani has long been seen as an extension of Trump, some mythical link to the U.S.,\u201d said Nickolay Kapitonenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s Foreign Policy Committee. \u201cSo many officials think that contact or even a picture with Giuliani might be helpful for their careers. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case but that\u2019s the perception.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, officials took a less rosy view of the president\u2019s lawyer. Months earlier, in mid-May, multiple U.S. officials told the whistleblower that they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by Mr. Giuliani\u2019s flouting of national-security protocols and that State Department officials including Mr. Volker had talked to Mr. Giuliani to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d to U.S. national security, according to the complaint. Those officials also met with Ukrainian officials to help them \u201cunderstand and respond to\u201d the conflicting messages they were receiving from official U.S. channels and Mr. Giuliani, according to the complaint.\n\nMr. Giuliani in Thursday\u2019s interview called the complaint \u201creally ridiculous\u201d and said he was baffled by the allegation that the State Department was upset with him over his work in Ukraine. \u201cIf they were worried about me, they did something very reckless,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took this crazy maniac who\u2019s interfering in foreign politics\u201d and arranged a meeting with a top aide to the Ukrainian president, he said, referring to the text message from Mr. Volker.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine issue and his frequent appearances on cable news have grated on some in the White House, according to aides, who have said privately they feel he has made the situation for the president worse.\n\nAt least for now, Mr. Trump remains enamored with Mr. Giuliani, people close to the president said. Mr. Trump has frequently praised his lawyer in public and in private for his loyalty and commitment to uncovering what both men believe is inappropriate behavior by Mr. Biden, who hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing. One administration official said it was unlikely that Mr. Trump\u2019s allies would even try to convince the president to cut ties with Mr. Giuliani because of the two men\u2019s tight bond.\n\nWhite House aides over the past year have grown accustomed to\u2014if not comfortable with\u2014the close relationship between the two men. Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani typically meet at the White House alone, aides say. Their meetings\u2014like many with Mr. Trump\u2019s close friends\u2014are rarely on the president\u2019s schedule that is circulated among aides.\n\nWhile serving as the president\u2019s lawyer, a role for which he doesn\u2019t draw a paycheck, Mr. Giuliani has also drawn scrutiny for his frequent trips abroad, where foreign officials say they have been uncertain whether he is speaking for himself or as a U.S. government representative.\n\nMr. Giuliani has met with foreign leaders including the king of Bahrain. Last year, he wrote to the president of Romania to criticize the country\u2019s anticorruption investigations, according to a copy of the letter released by Senate Democrats. His position in the letter is counter to that of the State Department.\n\nMr. Giuliani said at the time that he was working on behalf of his security company, Giuliani Security & Safety, which had been retained by a security company run by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis J. Freeh.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s role as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, opposition-research investigator and frequent defender on television is the latest incarnation for the former associate attorney general and U.S. attorney who became a global figure as mayor of New York when terrorists attacked the city on Sept. 11, 2001. After that, he threw himself into the world of global consulting, starting a management-consulting firm called Giuliani Partners in 2002.\n\nIn 2008, he sought to re-enter politics with a failed presidential campaign, during which he drew criticism for his business activities, including his efforts on behalf of Mexico City and a state-owned firm in Qatar.\n\nHis work with Ukraine began shortly after folding his campaign, when he announced he would serve as a strategic adviser to help boxer Vitali Klitschko, known as \u201cDr. Iron Fist,\u201d root out corruption and win election as the mayor of Kyiv. Mr. Klitschko lost that election but became mayor in 2014 and remains in that post.\n\nAfter the protests that took place in Kyiv in 2014, Mr. Klitschko negotiated a potential contract for Giuliani Security & Safety to restore order in the city. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s fee, roughly $300,000, was too steep, and the deal wasn\u2019t completed, according to a person who participated in the talks.\n\nMr. Giuliani didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the scuttled deal.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s political clout in Ukraine became outsized after Mr. Trump\u2019s election two years later. Mr. Giuliani had advised the president during the campaign and was floated as a possible nominee for attorney general or secretary of state, but ultimately wasn\u2019t tapped for an administration post. In January 2017, Mr. Trump said Mr. Giuliani would serve as an unofficial cybersecurity adviser, \u201csharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Giuliani returned to Ukraine for more consulting work that year, Ukrainian television broadcasts alternately referred to him as a private person and as Mr. Trump\u2019s adviser, a description that opened doors to many leading figures.\n\nIn June 2017, Mr. Giuliani visited Kyiv and gave a lecture on corruption and democracy. At an event hosted by the foundation of Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk, Mr. Giuliani met with then-President Petro Poroshenko and then-Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, according to the foundation\u2019s website.\n\nLater that year, Mr. Giuliani visited Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkov to hold meetings on behalf of his private security business. In Kharkov, the mayor had a row of girls in traditional Ukrainian dress on the airport tarmac meet him and make a traditional offering of bread and salt.\n\nMr. Giuliani, who in April 2018 began representing the president in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, became a magnet for Ukrainian officials looking to establish connections in Washington.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s investigation of Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, began in earnest earlier this year, after Mr. Lutsenko visited Mr. Giuliani\u2019s office in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. Western officials, including the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, had criticized Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s office for being sluggish on reforms.\n\nMr. Lutsenko told Mr. Giuliani that he thought there were unanswered questions about the role of the younger Biden at Burisma Holdings Ltd., where he had accepted a board seat in 2014. Vice President Biden\u2019s portfolio at the time included pressuring Ukraine to do more to combat corruption.\n\nMessrs. Giuliani and Lutsenko continued their conversation in a nearby bar over whiskey and cigars, the person familiar with the matter said. And the two men met again the next month in Warsaw.\n\nMr. Giuliani didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the meeting, and Mr. Lutsenko declined to comment.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s desire for a Biden investigation, however, soon ran into a perceived obstacle: the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Giuliani publicly accused her of anti-Trump bias, though he has denied he sought to pressure her ouster, which happened earlier this year when the State Department recalled her to Washington.\n\nIn a Fox News interview in May, he expressed relief that \u201cshe got fired finally.\u201d In another interview Tuesday on Fox News, he accused her without evidence of being \u201cdeeply involved\u201d in a plot by Ukraine to boost Democrats in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch, who remains a State Department employee and is a senior State Department fellow at Georgetown University, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cShe was doing everything by the book, everything was blessed by State Department,\u201d said a senior Ukraine government official who interacted with her.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role as an intermediary between the two countries was allegedly causing concern among multiple U.S. officials, according to the whistleblower complaint. U.S. officials told the whistleblower that Ukrainian officials understood that a meeting or call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky would depend on whether the new Ukrainian president \u201cshowed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019\u201d on the matters Mr. Giuliani had raised, according to the complaint. Mr. Giuliani didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn mid-July, a week before his call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump directed acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine. Lower-level officials were told of the decision on July 18, the Journal has reported, one day before Mr. Volker reached out to Mr. Giuliani about meeting with Mr. Yermak. The White House has said the aid was put on hold because the president wanted European countries to contribute more to Ukraine. The aid was released this month.\n\nMr. Giuliani in television appearances over the summer had repeatedly singled out Ukraine over corruption, putting pressure on Mr. Zelensky\u2019s new administration, which won election in April.\n\nIn July, Mr. Yermak called Mr. Giuliani to ask him to tone it down, according to a person familiar with the call. Mr. Giuliani in response suggested that Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with Burisma, the person said.\n\nIn early August, Mr. Giuliani met in Madrid with Mr. Yermak, in the meeting Mr. Volker had helped arrange. U.S. officials described the meeting to the whistleblower as a \u201cdirect followup\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky about the \u201ccases\u201d they discussed.\n\nMr. Giuliani described Mr. Yermak as \u201cvery receptive\u201d to their conversation and said he subsequently briefed Mr. Volker on the meeting. A person familiar with the conversation said Mr. Yermak told Mr. Giuliani that the Ukrainian president didn\u2019t want to get embroiled in U.S. politics.\n\nDays later, on Aug. 9, Mr. Trump told reporters of Mr. Zelensky: \u201cHe\u2019s a very reasonable guy.\u201d\n\n\u2014Thomas Grove\n\nand Andrew Restuccia contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com, Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.com, Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Brett Forrest at brett.forrest@wsj.com", "description": "A key figure at the heart of the burgeoning impeachment probe is former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who as personal attorney to President Trump pressed Ukraine on pursuing an investigation of one of his boss\u2019s political rivals.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus In Washington", "Alan Cullison", "Georgi Kantchev In Kyiv", "Brett Forrest In New York", "Rebecca Ballhaus", "Georgi Kantchev", "Brett Forrest", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com", "Alan.Cullison Wsj.Com", "Georgi.Kantchev Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111454/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
