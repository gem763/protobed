News reports spelled out exactly what Giuliani and Trump wanted, in detail.\n\nAD\n\nAs The Post reports, Pence was involved in pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky twice. Trump instructed Pence not to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May. And Pence privately met with Zelensky in September, to tell him hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid would not be released, due to concerns about Ukrainian \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPence\u2019s aides are claiming he was unaware of the pressure that Trump had been placing on Zelensky to manufacture dirt to smear Biden. The implication appears to be that Pence didn\u2019t know about the private pressure that Trump was placing.\n\nSimilarly, Pence\u2019s aides are also pushing back on The Post\u2019s report that a top Pence aide was on the July 25 call in which Trump directly pressured Zelensky, by claiming that act never really got back to Pence. Again, the implication is that Pence didn\u2019t know about that particular act of private pressure.\n\nAD\n\nAs implausible as all of that is, the more important point here is that it\u2019s basically meaningless as pushback. It isn\u2019t exonerating at all. That\u2019s because Pence simply did know that Trump wanted Ukraine to interfere in the next U.S. election on his behalf.\n\nAD\n\nWe know this, because what Trump wanted from Zelensky was widely broadcast in the public domain all throughout. Thus, the real story is that Pence knew in that he was playing a crucial part in Trump\u2019s effort to secure that foreign interference on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nHere\u2019s the timeline, with Pence\u2019s pressure on the Ukrainian president in bold:\n\nMay 9: The New York Times publishes a big story about Giuliani\u2019s plan to push Ukraine to investigate two matters: the origins of the special-counsel investigation finding Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf, and the matter involving Biden.\n\nAD\n\nThat narrative, which holds that Biden pressured Ukraine to oust a prosecutor to protect his son Hunter, has been entirely debunked.\n\nGiuliani is very clear in an interview with the Times, about why he\u2019s doing this, saying that this \u201cinformation will be very, very helpful to my client.\u201d There is almost no chance that Pence would not become aware of this, or know that it was being done with Trump\u2019s blessing.\n\nAD\n\nMay 10: Giuliani tweets about this whole plan the next day, saying Biden should be \u201cinvestigated\u201d by Ukraine. (Again, that\u2019s code for \u201csmeared with lies.\u201d)\n\nMay 19: Trump goes on Fox News and rails about Biden and Ukraine, falsely claiming that Biden improperly pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was supposedly \u201cafter\u201d his son.\n\nAD\n\nMay 20 or thereabouts: At the instruction of the White House, Pence cancels his planned trip to Zelensky\u2019s May 20 inauguration.\n\nJune 21: Giuliani tweets an explicit demand that Zelensky ramp up the investigations into Biden.\n\nJuly 18 or thereabouts: Trump orders the freeze on aid to Ukraine.\n\nJuly 25: Trump directly pressures Zelensky, as an aide to Pence listens in.\n\nSept. 1: Pence meets with Zelensky to tell him the military aid isn\u2019t coming, because of \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nPressed on whether Pence was aware of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky as Pence met with him, officials close to Pence ended up claiming, again implausibly, that Pence may not have read the transcript of Trump\u2019s call, or may not have registered what was important about it, even though his aide was on the call.\n\nAD\n\nPence\u2019s aides are also now claiming that, when Pence told Zelensky the problem was that Ukraine needed to investigate \u201ccorruption,\u201d he didn\u2019t understand that this was code for smearing Biden.\n\nBut as Jonathan Chait points out, this is wildly implausible, because it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely Pence already understood how this code worked \u2014 that the call for investigating \u201ccorruption\u201d was cover for a demand to smear Biden. After all, it had been public for months that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate Biden, and there\u2019s no way Pence believes that Trump actually cares about \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe bigger point here is that of course Pence perfectly understood the role of his own actions in this whole plot. It has been widely advertised all throughout, and Trump directed him to play his part in it.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: How this scandal could get much worse for Trump \u2014 and Pence\n\nHenry Olsen: Mike Pence has been dragged into the Ukraine affair.
