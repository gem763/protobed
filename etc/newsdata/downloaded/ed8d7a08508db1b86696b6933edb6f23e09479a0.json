There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nContrary to weeks of denials from the president and his defenders, a growing body of evidence makes clear it was Trump himself who repeatedly pushed his own government and a foreign power to intervene in domestic political concerns, enlisting and ensnaring a growing number of administration officials in a way that increasingly made even some members of his own team uncomfortable.\n\nThe wave of witnesses reflects the growing peril enveloping Trump amid the burgeoning inquiry, which he and some top aides have tried to block by refusing to abide by congressional subpoenas. Not only are a growing number of officials and longtime employees choosing to come forward with damaging evidence, the narrative they are laying out points to potential violations of law, including prohibitions on accepting campaign help from a foreign entity, that bolster the case for impeachment.\n\nThe prepared testimony Thursday of Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, showed how deeply the president involved himself in the Ukraine negotiations that are the focus of the inquiry, and the extent to which he outsourced Ukraine policy to his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters,\u201d Sondland said, according to his prepared remarks.\n\nYet despite his discomfort, Sondland said that because he and his team had been \u201cgiven the president\u2019s explicit direction,\u201d the group \u201cagreed to do as President Trump directed\u201d and involved Giuliani in the ongoing Ukraine discussions.\n\nAt the core of the impeachment inquiry is Trump\u2019s request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 while the United States was withholding nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine \u2014 for \u201ca favor\u201d in the form of investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as detailed in a rough transcript of a July 25 call between the two leaders that was released by the White House under public pressure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSondland\u2019s prepared remarks depict an atmosphere where diplomats at times felt trapped, torn between what they believed was right and the directives the president was issuing. Returning to the United States after attending Zelenksy\u2019s inauguration, Sondland said that he and the U.S. delegation urged Trump to arrange both a phone call and an Oval Office visit with Zelensky \u2014 only to be told by the president that he had concerns about Ukraine, and that they should talk to Giuliani about them.\n\n\u201cBased on the president\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice,\u201d Sondland wrote in his testimony, explaining the Ukraine envoys felt they could either \u201cabandon\u201d their effort to improve relations between the two countries, \u201cor we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns.\u201d (Ultimately, they chose the latter.)\n\nFinally, Sondland\u2019s prepared notes made clear that after he called Trump to specifically ask about allegations that the president was withholding aid to Ukraine in exchange for a political favor, Trump was upset with the mere question of impropriety.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president repeated: \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 multiple times,\u201d the remarks state. \u201cThis was a very short call. And I recall the president was in a bad mood.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry also clarified just how adamant Trump was in ensuring that Giuliani be included in Ukraine discussions.\n\n\u201cVisit with Rudy,\u201d Perry paraphrased the president as saying.\n\nPerry told the paper that after he contacted Trump\u2019s personal attorney as part of an effort to facilitate a meeting between the president and Zelensky, Giuliani relayed to him unsubstantiated concerns that Ukraine \u2014 not Russia, as the U.S. intelligence community has concluded \u2014 had interfered in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nOn Thursday, Perry notified Trump in writing that he planned to resign soon.\n\nAs early as May, Giuliani began publicly pushing theories involving Ukraine for which he had no reliable evidence. He urged, for instance, a corruption investigation into Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was vice president. So far, there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, many viewed Giuliani\u2019s efforts in the Ukraine as something of a personal passion project \u2014 the extracurricular schemes of an aging lawyer whose behavior even some in Trump\u2019s own orbit considered erratic.\n\nNow, however, as Giuliani has said himself and as a number of other witnesses have made clear, Giuliani was working at the behest of his client, the president of the United States.\n\nIn rough notes released by the White House of Trump\u2019s controversial call with Zelensky, the president seems to view Giuliani as almost interchangeable with Attorney General William P. Barr, telling Zelensky he hoped the Ukrainians could work with Giuliani and Barr to root out corruption there, including investigating the Bidens.\n\nMulvaney, too, acted as an enabler, organizing a meeting in late May that stripped control of Ukraine policy from experts at the National Security Council and State Department. He reassigned control to Perry, Sondland and Kurt Volker, then the special U.S. envoy to Ukraine \u2014 a group that called themselves \u201cThe Three Amigos.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven those with less one-on-one interactions with Trump have offered testimony painting a picture of dysfunction at best \u2014 and malfeasance at worst \u2014 emanating down from the president.\n\nLast Friday, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told congressional investigators that she had been forced out of her post by \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d Yovanovitch specifically named associates of Giuliani \u2014 two of whom have since been arrested over campaign finance violations \u2014 who she believe regarded her as a threat to their financial and political dealings.\n\nOn Monday, Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser, told investigators that on Ukraine, Giuliani ran a shadow foreign policy that bypassed traditional channels and career diplomats. Then-national security adviser John Bolton was so alarmed by Giuliani\u2019s actions that he instructed Hill to alert White House lawyers about his efforts, she testified.\n\nHill also testified that Bolton said he wanted no part of any \u201cdrug deal\u201d that the president\u2019s allies were pursing with Ukraine, and that Bolton described Giuliani as a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for Sondland \u2014 a wealthy Oregon hotelier \u2014 Hill told investigators that she believed he was a possible national security threat because he was so out of his depth when it came to handling the administration\u2019s Ukraine policy.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testified that he had resigned the previous week in protest over how he believed the State Department had become politicized under Trump and Pompeo. McKinley, according to his prepared testimony, also cited his concerns over the administration\u2019s efforts to pressure Zelensky into investigating the president\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cI was disturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,\u201d McKinley said in his prepared remarks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe steady stream of closed-door testimony, as well as public statements, contradicts Trump\u2019s repeated claims that his phone call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201ctotally appropriate,\u201d and that he did nothing wrong.\n\nNick Akerman, a prosecutor who investigated President Richard Nixon, said that unlike Watergate, when prosecutors struggled to figure out Nixon\u2019s role in the events they were investigating, a growing body of evidence points directly to Trump.\n\n\u201cHere, you\u2019ll have that in spades,\u201d Akerman said. \u201cAll these individuals, all testifying that this is what happened. . . . It\u2019s just cascading at this point.\u201d\n\nAkerman said that unlike Nixon\u2019s loyal cadre of aides, Trump\u2019s outer circle of aides and advisers are increasingly unwilling to shield him from what some view as his own dubious behavior.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where you\u2019ve got a lot of people who are career people, extremely smart people who certainly don\u2019t want their reputations smeared,\u201d Akerman said. \u201cTrump had to use these foreign services people and professionals. He didn\u2019t speak Ukrainian and Russian. He couldn\u2019t communicate his threat without these people. He was forced to use people whose loyalty was to the U.S. government and Constitution and not to him.\u201d\n\nAnd, he added, each new witness and detail seems to reveal a common thread: \u201cYou\u2019ve got Trump clearly involved.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Despite weeks of denials from the president and his defenders, a growing body of evidence details how Trump repeatedly pushed both the U.S. and Ukrainian governments to intervene in domestic political concerns.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ygy7F4Rlll_znunL35UM4tk9ncA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XSQUK7HQOII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
