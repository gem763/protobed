The third-place candidate, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is well behind the top two, with 11 percent.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSouth Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg is fourth, with 9 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris is fifth, with 6 percent.\n\nThe poll comes as all the major candidates descended on Iowa for the Polk County Democratic Party\u2019s annual steak fry, which drew the largest crowd in the event\u2019s history. But while Warren and Biden were significantly ahead of the rest of the field, there are still strong indications the race remains wide open: Nearly two-in-three likely caucus-goers, 63 percent, say they could be persuaded to change their mind after picking a top choice.\n\nOnly two-in-10, 20 percent, say their mind is made up about a first-choice candidate.\n\nThe Des Moines Register\u2019s poll, conducted by the West Des Moines-based Selzer & Co., is considered the most authoritative measure of caucus-goers among public surveys.\n\nThe latest poll was conducted Sept. 14-18, surveying 602 likely caucus-goers. The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nIn the previous poll, Biden (24 percent) led Sanders (16 percent) and Warren (15 percent). Though, the Register cautions, the new poll is not directly comparable to the previous survey because of methodological differences between the two polls.\n\nIn June, the poll included voters who said they would participate in \u201cvirtual caucuses,\u201d which the Iowa Democratic Party aimed to add to incorporate voters who were unable to attend caucuses on Feb. 3, 2020.\n\nBut since then, the Democratic National Committee has rejected Iowa\u2019s plans, concerned about the security of the virtual caucuses, which were set to account for 10 percent of delegates awarded.\n\nAfter the top four candidates, Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) are tied for fifth, with just 3 percent. Behind them, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (Texas), businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are at 2 percent.\n\nGabbard, who was excluded from the third debate earlier this month, is on the verge of becoming the 12th candidate to qualify for the fourth debate in mid-October. According to POLITICO\u2019s calculations, Gabbard only needs to earn 2 percent in one more qualifying poll before the Oct. 1 deadline to make the stage.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are the top two candidates in Iowa, according to the first-in-the-nation caucus state\u2019s definitive poll.<br />", "authors": ["Steven Shepard", "David Siders"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/20/a0/623eaa524f4ebc7c766503a7a204/19921-warren-iowa-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
