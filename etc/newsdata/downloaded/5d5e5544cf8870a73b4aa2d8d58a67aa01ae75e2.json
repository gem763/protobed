[Photo/Agencies]\n\nAbout two dozen House Republicans shouting \"Let us in! Let us in!'' barged into the secure room at the Capitol where the latest witness in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry was set to testify, temporarily shutting down the proceedings on Wednesday.\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz of Florida led the GOP lawmakers past Capitol Police into the hearing of the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.\n\nThey refused to leave in protest of the closed-door proceedings, delaying for about five hours testimony by Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy, whom lawmakers planned to ask about the White House's decision to withhold military aid for several months over the summer.\n\nRepresentative Steve Scalise of Louisiana declared: \"This is a Soviet-style process. It should not be allowed in the United States of America. Every member of Congress ought to be allowed in that room. The press ought to be allowed in that room.\"\n\nRepublicans ordered pizza and fast food for reporters assembled to witness the action.\n\nSome of the Republicans brought cellphones into the room, took videos and tweeted from inside, which isn't permitted and considered a security breach. The sergeant-at-arms, the top law enforcement officer in the Capitol, was called in.\n\nMost of the Republicans who pushed into the room aren't on the committees conducting the inquiry and aren't entitled to attend the hearings.\n\nRepublicans who are on the committees have been in on all hearings and have heard all the witnesses and asked questions. Democrats say they will open the process for public hearings after they conduct their investigation.\n\nAdam Schiff, Democratic House Intelligence Committee chairman, has defended the closed-door hearings, saying that they prevent witnesses from coordinating their accounts of events at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats called the Republican shutdown of the hearing a \"stunt''.\n\n\"It's totally inappropriate,\" said Representative Harley Rouda from California, who watched the episode. \"When the facts are against you, when the law is against you \u2026 you're left arguing process.''\n\nThe Republicans barging into the room came the day after William B. Taylor Jr, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, testified that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to conduct a pair of investigations \u2014 one into 2016 election hacking, the other into the family of former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden \u2014 that might have helped Trump's re-election campaign next year.\n\nThe testimony by Taylor contradicted Trump saying that that there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with the former Soviet state.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db1c026a310cf3e97a2d7a5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
