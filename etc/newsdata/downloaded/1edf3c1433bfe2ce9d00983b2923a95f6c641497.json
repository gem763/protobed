The bank has raked in $40 billion in new assets from top-tier hedge funds including Renaissance Technologies and D.E. Shaw, one of the people said, while another said the total wasn't quite that high.\n\nIn a business already notorious for thin spreads, sources say JPMorgan has been pricing its prime brokerage offering competitively and angling to add more scale. Ranked second to Morgan Stanley last year, according to Coalition data, JPMorgan has picked up share this year, one of the people said.\n\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. Spokesmen for Deutsche Bank, Renaissance, and D.E. Shaw also declined to comment.\n\nJPMorgan isn't the only firm that's benefiting. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citigroup have all acquired billions from jettisoned Deutsche Bank balances as well, sources say. Barclays, thought to be an early winner, now looks to rank behind JPMorgan. It acquired roughly $20 billion in prime brokerage assets, CEO Jes Staley said in August on an earnings call with analysts.\n\nRead more: Leaked internal memos lay out Deutsche Bank's new org chart following a massive restructuring and 18,000 job cuts\n\n\"It's part of the markets business where you earn revenue on Saturdays and Sundays and holidays. So it's quite a business,\" Staley said on that call. \"And also, it reinforces the important relationships you have with principal actors in the capital markets. It is very profitable, and we will continue to pursue that business.\"\n\nFrench bank BNP Paribas reached a preliminary agreement to acquire Deutsche Bank's prime brokerage technology, platform, and hundreds of staff, though it's unclear yet how much actual client business it will convince to move over.\n\nThe banks each declined to comment.\n\nHedge funds typically have a handful of prime-brokerage providers, so many of the firms transferring assets away from Deutsche Bank have a smooth transition to already well-established relationships.\n\nDeutsche Bank for years was known for having one of the strongest platforms for serving hedge funds, especially quant-focused shops. In addition to Renaissance and D.E. Shaw, AQR and Two Sigma were also top clients but have recently shifted business to other banks, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBut as with the firm overall, the division's fortunes declined in recent years, with revenues falling by a third since 2015, according to a Bloomberg report from March.\n\nRather than regroup for yet another effort to stanch the bleeding within its investment bank, the German lender opted instead for more drastic measures: A radical $8.3 billion restructuring that included abandoning the equities business and slashing 18,000 employees by 2022.\n\nAround $75 billion of Deutsche Bank's nearly $200 billion in balances still remain, sources say.\n\nPrime services produced $18.3 billion in revenue in 2018 among Wall Street's top banks, according to industry data consultant Coalition.\n\nMorgan Stanley has consistently ranked first in that business line, followed by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.\n\nDeutsche Bank didn't crack the top-7, according to Coalition.", "description": "Following Deutsche Bank's equities exit, Wall Street competitors have gobbled up billions in assets from the firm's most-coveted hedge fund clients.", "authors": ["Alex Morrell", "Dakin Campbell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/54c7d6bf69bedda31587fe20-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
