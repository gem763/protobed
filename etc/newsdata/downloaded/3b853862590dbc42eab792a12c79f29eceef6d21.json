She was successful at 4.80 on her second attempt.\n\n\"I started off pretty rocky so I think it got in my head a little bit,\" Newman said. \"I need to mature about that stuff and just keep going.\"\n\nWATCH | Alysha Newman clears 4.80 metres at world championships:\n\nCanadian-record holder Alysha Newman cleared 4.80 metres for a 5th place result in pole vault final. 0:43\n\nNewman arrived at worlds feeling the \"healthiest and strongest\" she has in a long time and looked forward to pushing 4.90 or five metres.\n\n\"If I can finish with a 4.90 at worlds and enter next year jumping 4.80 and go for 4.95 and five metres, I'm going to jump five metres at the Olympics [next summer],\" she told CBC Sports recently.\n\nWATCH | Newman: 'Tokyo Olympics is something to work towards'\n\nCanada's Alysha Newman discusses her 5th place result in pole vault. 1:22\n\n3rd in world rankings\n\nThe London, Ont.-born athlete enjoyed a healthy season after missing much of 2018 with a partial tear of the left patellar tendon, which attaches the bottom of the kneecap to the top of the shinbone.\n\nNewman entered worlds ranked third in the world after beating reigning Olympic champion Katerina Stefanidi of Greece for her first Diamond League victory with a 4.82 showing at the Meeting de Paris on Aug. 24.\n\nWATCH | Newman jumps personal-best 4.82m in Paris:\n\nAlysha Newman wins pole vault in Paris by clearing 4.82m, sets new Canadian record. 0:52\n\nHer opponents began to take notice of her progress after that event while Newman enjoyed striking fear into her opponents with her improved performance.\n\n\"I go to events now, people have seen what I've done, see what I'm capable of and they're scared,\" she said earlier this month. \"That's how I felt looking at Katerina, Sandi [Morris] and [Anzhelika] Sidorova. I knew if they were on their game, they would win every time.\"\n\nSidorova was on her game Sunday, clearing 4.95 on her third and final attempt to upend 2017 world champion Stefanidi and top American Jenn Suhr's season-leading mark of 4.91.
