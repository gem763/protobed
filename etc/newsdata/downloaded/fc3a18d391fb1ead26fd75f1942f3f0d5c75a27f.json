Gina Miller case fails Legal campaigner Gina Miller vows to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court dismissed her claim that the prime minister acted unlawfully in giving advice to the Queen to suspend parliament at a time of momentous political upheaval. Parliament dissolved Parliament is dissolved amid chaotic scenes as some MPs hold up signs saying they have been silenced, try to prevent Speaker John Bercow leaving the chamber, and sing the Red Flag. Scottish court ruling The court of session in Scotland rules that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful. The case will go to the supreme court. Supreme court hearing due The UK\u2019s highest court has arranged a three-day hearing to join together all the legal challenges to the prorogation. MPs return? The date that Boris Johnson is planning for the state opening of parliament and Queen's speech marking the start of the new session\n\nThe three Scottish judges, who will issue their reasonings in full on Friday, said unanimously the prorogation was unlawful \u201cbecause it had the purpose of stymying parliament\u201d.\n\nCarloway, the lord president of the court of session \u2013 the supreme civil court of Scotland \u2013 said parliamentary scrutiny of the executive was \u201ca central pillar of the good governance principle enshrined in the constitution\u201d.\n\nLord Brodie said that attempting to frustrate parliament in this way was \u201can egregious case of a clear failure to comply with generally accepted standards of behaviour of public authorities\u201d.\n\nThe court\u2019s summary concluded that Johnson\u2019s prorogation request to the Queen and her decision to accept it \u201cwas unlawful and is thus null and of no effect\u201d.\n\nMaugham said: \u201cOur understanding is that unless the supreme court grants an order in the meantime, parliament is unsuspended with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved that my understanding of the functioning of our democracy \u2013 that allows parliament to exercise its vital constitutional role \u2013 has been vindicated by Scotland\u2019s highest court.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly important point of principle. The prime minister mustn\u2019t treat parliament as an inconvenience.\u201d\n\nJoanna Cherry QC, the Scottish National party MP who was the lead applicant in the case, called for prorogation to be halted. \u201cThe court agreed it is unlawful to suspend the UK parliament for the specific purpose of preventing parliament from scrutinising the Brexit process and holding this shambolic Tory government\u2019s extreme Brexit plans to account,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis ruling takes us one step closer to ensuring the UK government cancels their shameful prorogation and blatant plot to force through an extreme Brexit. Boris Johnson cannot be allowed to break the law with impunity.\u201d\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed by today\u2019s decision and will appeal to the UK supreme court. The UK government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this.\u201d\n\nNo 10 sources said the government noted that last week the high court in London did not rule that prorogation was unlawful, which suggests ministers may try to hold back from recalling parliament until an appeal ruling.\n\nA spokeswoman for John Bercow, the Speaker, and the House of Commons authorities said it would be up to Johnson to recall parliament during prorogation. \u201cAny decision to accelerate the meeting of parliament during prorogation is a matter for the government,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, calls quickly grew among opposition parties for Johnson to act now to restore sitting for the House of Commons and Lords.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said: \u201cToday\u2019s court of session judgment is of huge constitutional significance \u2013 but the immediate political implications are clear. Court says prorogation was unlawful and null and void \u2013 so parliament must be recalled immediately to allow the essential work of scrutiny to continue.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cI welcome the court\u2019s judgment. No one in their right mind believed Boris Johnson\u2019s reason for shutting down parliament.\n\n\u201cI urge the prime minister to immediately recall parliament so we can debate this judgment and decide what happens next.\u201d\n\nShami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, added: \u201cThis ruling shows that, despite what Boris Johnson has spent his privileged life thinking, he is not above the law. Labour will not allow his elitist shutdown of parliament to enable him to dodge scrutiny and force through a disastrous no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, tweeted: \u201cScottish judges have found in favour of 75 MPs (including me and other Liberal Democrats). We argued that Boris Johnson\u2019s parliament shutdown is illegal, and designed to stifle parliamentary debate and action on Brexit.\u201d", "description": "Appeal court says prorogation order \u2018void\u2019 but fails to issue injunction for MPs to return", "authors": ["Severin Carrell", "Rowena Mason", "Robert Saunders", "Peter Bone", "Margaret Beckett", "Michael Chessum", "Meg Russell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41e6ab81d9aaa6b6b7fe25c7f024b26a9f6822f4/0_226_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b705906995b4d6c4829673a43d8b029e", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
