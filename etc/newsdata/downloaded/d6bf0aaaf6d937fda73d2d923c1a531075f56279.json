Remember 2018?", "language": "en", "text": "AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster Opinion Democrats, Stop Obsessing Over Base Turnout. Remember 2018?\n\nLanae Erickson is senior vice president for the Social Policy & Politics Program at Third Way.\n\nFor years, left-wing candidates and pundits have complained that the big problem with the Democratic Party is that it just doesn\u2019t energize progressives. The argument goes like this: If you nominate a self-described socialist or a true champion of far-left policies, you\u2019ll mobilize a hidden treasure trove of progressive voters who have been just sitting at home waiting for a \u201creal\u201d progressive to come along\u2014and you won\u2019t even have to talk to a single Trump voter. There\u2019s no doubt we will all see this base-obsessed strategy on full display in this week\u2019s debate, which will feature Democratic presidential candidates leapfrogging each other to the left on almost every issue imaginable. Sen. Bernie Sanders will call for Medicare for All, Julian Castro will pledge to repeal the law that makes unauthorized border crossings a crime and Andrew Yang will extol the virtues of a Universal Basic Income\u2014all with the hope that exciting the base will put them in the White House.\n\nI have just one question for the purveyors of this mobilization theory. Can you give me one example of a competitive election where it\u2019s actually worked?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe United States is in the midst of a crisis. A racist, lying egomaniac is occupying the White House. This simply isn\u2019t the time to bet on an untested hypothesis that sounds good but has never resulted in a real-life win. The stakes are too high. Instead, Democrats should run the 2018 playbook that just delivered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the gavel and put Democrats in the governors\u2019 mansions of purple and red states from coast to coast. To beat Donald Trump, of course Democrats must mobilize voters. But the party also must persuade voters beyond its base and build a broad coalition\u2014and that base must include some of the folks who pulled the lever for him the first time around.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an academic debate. We just had a major test called the 2018 midterms, and the results couldn\u2019t be clearer. Sanders and his allied organizations Our Revolution and Justice Democrats said they were going to use that election to prove their case. They ran a bunch of far-left candidates in Democratic primaries across the country who carried their agenda. Breathless media coverage insisted that revolutionaries like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan were taking over the party, and Sanders personally campaigned with congressional candidates who agreed to push his policy agenda. So what happened? Only a third of those candidates could even persuade enough Democratic voters to win their own primary in swing districts. And not a single one of them flipped a Republican seat\u2014in a cycle that saw Democrats gain a total of 41.\n\nInstead, the crop of diverse and dynamic candidates who actually turned red seats blue were mainstream Democrats like Reps. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Colin Allred of Texas, Sharice Davids of Kansas and Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico. These candidates ran on kitchen table issues like reducing the cost of health care, raising wages and cleaning up corruption in Washington. Gay and straight, white, black and brown and led by some incredible female first-time candidates, they inspired historic turnout and persuaded swing voters that they were better equipped than Republicans to address the concerns that keep them up at night.\n\nThe list of winners who delivered Democrats the House doesn\u2019t include a socialist among them, and the only two candidates who ran ads on single-payer health care in swing districts lost despite the Democratic wave. Not a single candidate who flipped a seat ran ads on free college or a federal jobs guarantee. Far from embracing open borders, as Republicans tried to claim, they emphasized border security and a pathway to citizenship to push back against Republican anti-immigrant attacks. They prevailed in the places Democrats will need to win to defeat Trump in 2020.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take my word for it\u2014progressive data firm Catalist ran the numbers. Based on an in-depth look at the voter file data, they determined earlier this summer that 89 percent of the improvement in Democratic margin from the presidential election in 2016 to House races in 2018 came from people who changed their vote. That means only 11 percent came from adding new voters to the mix, and 40 percent of new voters actually pulled the lever for Republicans (disproving the notion that every voter added is a Democratic voter gained). Why did persuading those who didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton make up so much more of the margin than adding new folks to the rolls? Because a persuaded voter counts for double: You not only gain one in your column, you take one away from your opponent. In short, that means for every gettable voter Democrats decide not to try to persuade, they need to conjure up two new ones to make up for that choice. And we know there are a bunch of gettable voters out there, since they just voted for a Democrat in the midterms.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the House. Democrats just won governors\u2019 races in the exact Blue Wall states that are the quickest path to victory in 2020\u2014and they did so by running on mainstream ideas that both energized Democrats and persuaded voters we lost in 2016 to give Democrats another chance. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won by 406,534 votes in the must-win state of Michigan not by promising to usher in a socialist revolution but to \u201cfix the damn roads.\u201d Gov. Tony Evers flipped the bellwether state of Wisconsin by focusing on \u201creal solutions\u201d for crumbling public education and rising health care costs. Both of them assembled a broad coalition of black, brown and white voters from cities, suburbs and rural areas. Take it from these winners in these key Electoral College states: Democrats don\u2019t have to shout like Bernie Sanders to rebuild the Blue Wall\u2014they just need to talk about the things voters care about (and not be fooled into thinking the Twitterverse is in any way representative of the American electorate).\n\nSo during Thursday night\u2019s debate, pay attention to the candidates that are talking about issues that unite a wide swath of gettable voters\u2014like expanding economic opportunity, making work pay and reducing the cost of health care\u2014rather than those who are racing each other to impress activists on the left. Turning out your base is important. No one is saying it isn\u2019t. But mobilizing progressives alone isn\u2019t enough to actually win. And in 2020, Democrats need to win. Concentrating on anything else right now will hand the White House to the worst president in history\u2014again.", "description": "This simply isn\u2019t the time to bet on an untested hypothesis that sounds good but has never resulted in a real-life win.", "authors": ["William J.
