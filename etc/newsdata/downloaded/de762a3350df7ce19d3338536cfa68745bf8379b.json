REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\n\u201cThe key issue is the principle of consent, that\u2019s why the backstop was rejected three times, that was the concern in terms of both sides in Northern Ireland not approving of the backstop,\u201d Barclay told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSo the key is the principle of consent, now of course in the mechanism, as part of the intensive negotiations we could look at that and discuss that.\u201d\n\nThe 500 km (300 mile) border between Northern Ireland and European Union member Ireland, which will be the United Kingdom\u2019s only land frontier with the bloc after it leaves, has become the biggest sticking point of Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe problem is how to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a \u201cback door\u201d into the EU\u2019s single market and customs union without erecting border controls that could undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of political and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland in which more than 3,600 people were killed.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he cannot accept the so-called backstop arrangement included in the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with the EU by his predecessor Theresa May, which British lawmakers rejected three times.\n\nHe made what he called a final Brexit offer to the European Union on Wednesday which centers on replacing the backstop with a proposal for an all-island regulatory zone to cover all goods.\n\nThe proposal also says the legislative assembly in Northern Ireland \u2014 which has been suspended since 2017 \u2014 would have the right to decide every four years whether it wants to continue to abide by EU rules on traded goods.\n\nThe European Union and Ireland, however, said the proposals were unlikely to result in a deal without more concessions.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he did not fully understand how the British proposals might work and that Dublin could not sign up to a treaty that did not safeguard an open Irish-British border.\n\nWriting in the Sun on Sunday newspaper, Johnson said the proposals were a \u201cpractical compromise that gives ground where necessary while still protecting the UK\u2019s interests and the Brexit this country voted for\u201d.\n\nHe said lawmakers from every wing of his Conservative Party, from his allies in Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP and even from the opposition Labour Party had said they could get behind the deal.\n\n\u201cAnd I salute the spirit of compromise from MPs on all sides who have looked at what\u2019s on the table, reflected on what\u2019s best for their constituents, and decided they are willing to put aside their personal beliefs and back the deal that they know will get Brexit done,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Britain could do a deal if the EU was willing.\n\n\u201cBut they should be under no illusions or misapprehensions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no more dither or delay. On Oct. 31 we are going to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nWith the deadline approaching, Johnson has consistently said he will not ask for another delay to Brexit, but also that he will not break a law that forces him to request one if no withdrawal deal has been agreed by Oct. 19. He has not explained the apparent contradiction in his comments.\n\nThe government acknowledged for the first time on Friday that Johnson will send a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit delay if no divorce deal has been reached.", "description": "Britain is open to some flexibility on the mechanism that would allow lawmakers in Northern Ireland to decide whether the British province remains in regulatory alignment with the European Union, as set out in London's latest Brexit proposals, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437669180&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9507Z", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
