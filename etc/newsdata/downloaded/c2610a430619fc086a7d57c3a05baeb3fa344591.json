At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke. Quo vadis? [Where are you going?].\u201d\n\nEU may offer to extend deadline for Brexit deal to summer Read more\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who said \u201cnobody would come out a winner\u201d in a no-deal scenario. \u201cI do not accept this \u2018blame game\u2019 of pinning the eventual failure of the negotiations on the EU. If that\u2019s the case, the explanation is actually in the British camp,\u201d he said.\n\nJuncker said Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals would leave the UK with a relationship with the EU that was \u201cless intimate than with Canada\u201d.\n\nA senior UK government source conceded the talks had stalled, even though David Frost, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, is still trying to keep discussions going in Brussels.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we were going to hit this rock on both sides on the customs issue. If it\u2019s the EU position that Northern Ireland has to be in the customs union, and that does appear to be the case, that\u2019s not acceptable to us. Our position is that we need to come out and that seems to be where we are stuck.\u201d\n\nBoth sides agree that customs arrangements on the island of Ireland are at the crux of the standoff \u2013 though Brussels also rejects what it regards as a Democratic Unionist party veto over plans to keep Northern Ireland\u2019s regulations in line with those of the EU.\n\nThe Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said that Johnson had told Varadkar on Tuesday evening that he still wanted a deal.\n\nJohnson and Varadkar have agreed to meet in the coming days, with both sides keen to avoid blame for no deal.\n\nHowever, the taoiseach said Ireland and the EU would not accept an agreement at \u201cany cost\u201d. He told RT\u00c9 news: \u201cThere are some fundamental objectives that haven\u2019t changed for the past three years and we need them guaranteed. I think it is going to be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nNicky Morgan and Julian Smith were among those who challenged Johnson during what several sources claimed was a tetchy cabinet meeting. When Morgan questioned the prime minister about anonymous briefings, he replied that ministers should listen to him instead.\n\nAfter the meeting was over, Smith issued a rebuke to the person \u2013 believed to be the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings \u2013 who anonymously briefed the Spectator that the government would withhold security cooperation from EU countries who supported a Brexit delay.\n\n\u201cI am clear that any threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable. This is not in the interest of Northern Ireland or the Union,\u201d Smith tweeted.\n\nThe statement triggered speculation that he could resign, but sources close to Smith insisted that he was \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d.\n\nWhen Johnson arrived in Downing Street in July, he insisted that all recruits to his cabinet sign up to the idea of pursuing a no-deal Brexit if it proved impossible to strike an agreement with Brussels.\n\nBut some are privately concerned about persistent suggestions Johnson could try to circumvent the Benn act, which is aimed at forcing him to request a Brexit delay if he fails to strike a deal at next week\u2019s European council meeting.\n\nThe Benn act suggests an extension of Brexit talks until the end of January 2020 but there will be concern in EU capitals that this may not provide sufficient time for any potential fallout from a general election to play out.\n\nDuring angry exchanges in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, accused Johnson of deliberately making a proposal he knew Brussels would reject.\n\n\u201cTalks with the EU are collapsing as we speak,\u201d he said, responding to a defiant statement from Michael Gove about no-deal Brexit preparedness.\n\n\u201cThe proposals that the government introduced last week were never going to work and instead of reacting to challenge by adapting them, they are intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game. It will be working people who pay the price. The prime minister should be here to account for his actions.\u201d\n\nThe European parliament president, David Sassoli, emerged downbeat from discussions with Johnson in London on Tuesday, telling reporters the UK government\u2019s plans were \u201cnot an actual proposal\u201d.\n\nSassoli appeared exasperated and said that Johnson had refused to consider any new holistic proposals, instead repeating that the UK would leave on 31 October come what may. This lack of flexibility was \u201cextremely sad\u201d, the Italian said.\n\nAsked if he thought Johnson was serious about a deal, Sassoli repeated that Johnson had given no new proposals and merely insisted on a 31 October departure.\n\n\u201cI think each and every one of us must reach the conclusions that they believe the most appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cI sincerely hope that there will be a wake-up call. Up to the very last minute, it will be possible for the European Union and parliament to try and find a deal.\u201d Sassoli added that MEPs were open to a Brexit extension.\n\nIn Brussels, diplomats are beginning to turn their minds to the length of any potential extension. A range of dates will be in play at the meeting of European leaders next week, but sources suggested the natural cut-off date would be next June.\n\nWith an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership now looking inevitable, other diplomatic sources suggested an unlikely outlier for an end date could even precede a possible general election so as to force the Commons into accepting a deal. \u201cBut politicians like to keep things off their plates for as long as possible and so pushing it longer seems more realistic,\u201d a senior EU diplomat said.\n\nBrussels appears to have accepted that negotiations over a deal are effectively dead, following Downing Street\u2019s extraordinary claims over the substance of the phone conversation between Merkel and Johnson.\n\n'Immature' No 10 briefings trigger another day of Brexit trouble Read more\n\nThe alleged content of the Merkel-Johnson call was dismissed by senior politicians in Berlin as being \u201cimprobable\u201d.\n\nMPs were sent home on Tuesday night as parliament is suspended for a few days in the run-up to next week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, which Johnson will use to set out an election-friendly list of domestic priorities.\n\nMost at Westminster expect Johnson to be forced into requesting a Brexit extension and to then trigger a general election, which could be held in November or early December.\n\nHowever, Johnson continues to insist that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October \u2013 a message the government is promoting with a multimillion pound public information campaign urging businesses and the public to \u201cget ready\u201d.", "description": "EU may offer to extend Brexit talks to summer, despite PM\u2019s insistence UK will leave on 31 October", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Daniel Boffey", "Rowena Mason", "Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9fce690b517a4687c8cf3113615738701605fc0/14_79_3378_2027/master/3378.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=466ec96a28965d8bda281ad0b37224b8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
