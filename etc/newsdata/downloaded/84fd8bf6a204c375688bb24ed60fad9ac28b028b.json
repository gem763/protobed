Residents are using face masks. We should not pay the price of our health for the open burning. We want a solution,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur and neighbouring Singapore were also experiencing hazy conditions on Monday, with the air laced with the smell of burning foliage, although the pollutant index remained at moderate levels.\n\nSome Kuala Lumpur residents complained about eye and throat irritation.\n\nMalaysia's meteorological department on Sunday warned that hot conditions will prevail for another week, and the monsoon season is only expected to arrive at the end of September or early October.\n\nThe ministry of science, technology and innovation on Friday said it would lodge a complaint with Indonesia for the haze and called for quick action to be taken to put out the fires.\n\nIndonesian authorities have deployed thousands of extra personnel since last month to prevent a repeat of the 2015 fires, which were the worst for two decades and choked the region in haze for weeks.\n\nUnder pressure from neighbours, Indonesian leader Joko Widodo last month warned that officials would be sacked if they failed to stamp out forest fires.", "description": "Malaysia prepared to seed clouds after air quality in parts of the country reached unhealthy levels due to smog from forest fires in neighbouring Indonesia, an official says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9335/533eb63aeb4441e5bfc344df5e7e5d2c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
