(AP) - Derwin James remains involved with the Los Angeles Chargers defense despite being injured.\n\nThe All-Pro safety attends meetings and walkthroughs while he rehabs from surgery to repair a stress fracture on his right foot. James suffered the injury during training camp and had surgery Aug. 22. He is on injured reserve but the hope is that James can return for the final five games of the regular season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Coach James right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI still need to be involved in the mental part of the game. I don\u2019t want to be all the way out.\u201d\n\nJames\u2018 second seasons in college and the NFL have been marred by injuries. He first suffered a stress fracture on the foot the summer before his sophomore season at Florida State. Then two games into the 2016 season, he tore the meniscus in his knee during the fourth quarter of a blowout victory against Charleston Southern.\n\nHe didn\u2019t play the rest of that season and redshirted. The one valuable lesson James learned is that you can\u2019t rush the rehab process.\n\n\u201cIt is very important with any fractures to make sure the bone heals on its own. With a hamstring or some soft tissue injuries you might be able to push it but with bones you can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nJames became an integral part of the Chargers defense last season after being drafted with the 17th-overall pick. He led the team with 105 tackles along with four interceptions, 3.5 sacks and 13 passes defensed. He also had two sacks and an interception in the first three games, becoming the first rookie in a non-strike year since Dallas\u2019 Bill Bates in 1983 to accomplish that.\n\nJames said he knew something was wrong with his foot after making an interception during a joint practice with the Saints on Aug. 15.\n\n\u201cI knew but I didn\u2019t want to know. It felt the same way it did in college,\u201d he said. \u201cI was very disappointed because I wanted to continue the momentum I had last year. It kind of stinks. The rehab process is tough and long but it makes your game better.\u201d\n\nDefensive coordinator Gus Bradley said James has done a good job remaining engaged in meetings while rehabbing, including breaking down the defensive game plan for Sunday\u2019s game at Detroit before Thursday\u2019s practice.\n\nAdrian Philips is starting in James\u2018 place and had six tackles in Sunday\u2019s 30-24 win over Indianapolis.\n\nJames is among a growing number of injured Chargers. Cornerback Trevor Williams was placed on injured reserve earlier this week due to a nagging quad injury and tight end Hunter Henry is out for an extended period due to a knee injury.\n\nWide receiver Mike Williams (knee), kicker Michael Badgley (groin) and linebacker Denzel Perryman (ankle) are among seven players listed as questionable for Sunday\u2019s game at Detroit. The Chargers are aiming for their first 2-0 start since 2012 and have won eight of their last nine regular-season road games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over the league. From week to week sometimes you never know what roster you\u2019re going to have. As coaches, it\u2019s our job to figure out how to win with the personnel that we have,\u201d coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Derwin James remains involved with the Los Angeles Chargers defense despite being injured.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
