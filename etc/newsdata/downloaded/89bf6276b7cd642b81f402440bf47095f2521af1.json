REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\n\u201cI never said there was a quid pro quo because there isn\u2019t,\u201d Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday, using a Latin phrase meaning a favour for a favour.\n\nMulvaney told reporters on Thursday that Trump\u2019s decision to withhold $391 million in aid to Ukraine was linked in part to his desire for an investigation by Kiev into a debunked theory that a Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer server was held in Ukraine. His remarks at a White House news conference created turmoil in Washington and left the president\u2019s Republican allies flummoxed and frustrated.\n\nMulvaney walked back the comments in a statement the same day. But after weeks in which the president argued that he had done nothing wrong, Mulvaney\u2019s remarks undermined the core arguments that Trump and his advisers have made against the effort to oust him from office in a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry.\n\nMulvaney said on Sunday that he did not offer to resign over the episode, nor was his possible resignation discussed at the White House.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, positively not,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference, no, but again the facts are on our side ... I still think I\u2019m doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and I think the president agrees.\u201d\n\nTrump, a Republican who is seeking re-election in 2020, has said the aid to Kiev was frozen because he believed European countries should also contribute. Mulvaney said on Sunday the European aid had been a concern along with corruption in Ukraine, and noted that the \u201caid flowed\u201d eventually.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday supported Mulvaney\u2019s walk-back of his remarks, saying he had not seen evidence of a connection between withholding Ukraine aid and Kiev pursuing a political investigation.\n\n\u201cI never saw that in the decision-making process that I was a part of .... the conversation was always around what were the strategic implications, would that money get to the right place or would there be corruption in Ukraine and the money wouldn\u2019t flow to the mission that it was intended for,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nThe original Mulvaney remarks produced anxiety among some Republicans, including Senator Lisa Murkowski, who told reporters foreign aid should not be held up for a political initiative, and Representative Francis Rooney, who told CNN he could not rule out that such linkage would be an impeachable offence.\n\nMulvaney told Fox News Sunday it was \u201cjust absurd\u201d to think that the episode, as well as Republican resistance to Trump\u2019s plan to pull U.S. troops from Syria, made it more likely the Republican-led Senate would vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges if they are filed by the Democratic-led House.\n\nMulvaney said Trump was still \u201cextraordinarily popular back home\u201d and Republican lawmakers would respond to that.\n\nDemocrats continued to focus on the Ukraine \u201cquid pro quo\u201d issue.\n\n\u201cRepublicans face a simple question: is the president allowed to pressure a foreign country into interfering in our elections? History will remember their answer, or their silence,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote on Twitter.", "description": "Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday he had not offered to resign for indicating last week that U.S. President Donald Trump had sought a political favour from Ukraine in exchange for military aid, comments he has since retracted.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443052687&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0JR", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
