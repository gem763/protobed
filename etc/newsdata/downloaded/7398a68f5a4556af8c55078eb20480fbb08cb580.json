The Houston Astros clinched their ticket to the ALCS. Here's everything you need to know heading into the league championship series. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Houston Astros manager A.J. Hinch thought the first time he heard it was when he arrived at spring training.\n\nJustin Verlander, the Astros\u2019 likely Cy Young winner, says he definitely remembers people talking about it on April 8, the first time the New York Yankees came to town.\n\nNow that he thinks about it, Astros MVP candidate Alex Bregman says, he doesn\u2019t remember a day this season when he didn\u2019t hear about it.\n\nThe Houston Astros vs. the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Astros made sure it would happen Thursday, defeating the pesky Tampa Bay Rays, 6-1, and winning their American League Division Series, three games to two. The Yankees clinched their berth Monday with a three-game sweep over the Minnesota Twins.\n\nNow, the marquee matchup begins Saturday night at Minute Maid Park in Houston.\n\nPower hitting vs. Power pitching.\n\nSuper bullpen vs. Super starters.\n\nAnd enough star power to light up the billboards on Broadway.\n\nJose Altuve crosses home plate after hitting a home run against the Yankees in April.

The power from the plate and the mound are going against each other. To be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best, and look, they\u2019re the best team in baseball, them and us, so I think it\u2019s great we\u2019re facing each other.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been brewing,\u2019\u2019 said Verlander, who will pitch Game 2 of the series with Zack Greinke scheduled to go Game 1 and Cole in Game 3. \u201cWe heard about it from the first series we played against each other. Here\u2019s an ALCS preview.\n\n\u201cIt worked out. These are two incredible powerhouse teams. We\u2019ll find ourselves in the middle of the ring and we\u2019ll be going at it.\u2019\u2019\n\nSays Astros center fielder Jake Marisnick: We\u2019re looking forward to it. They\u2019re looking forward to it. It\u2019s going to be a battle. We\u2019ve been hearing the rumblings of this since spring training, and now it\u2019s here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go toe-to-toe with them.\u2019\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no need for ring announcer Michael Buffer.\n\n\u201cI heard it from Day 1,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Hinch says, \u201cjust the way the teams are aligned. And the moves that were made in the off-season to set up teams. We both went through a lot of injuries, but it never really stopped either of us with the depth we had. And now we delivered to have one of the premier matchups to see who represents the American League in the World Series.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros have a chance to be known as the greatest team of this decade.\n\nThe Yankees have a chance to end their 10-year World Series drought, and assure that this won\u2019t be the first decade in franchise history without a World Series appearance.\n\n\u201cWe understand what\u2019s at stake,\u2019\u2019 Hinch says. \u201cWe don\u2019t scare off. And now we have one of the toughest teams in the major leagues to have to get to the World Series.\n\n\u201cSo buckle up.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf there\u2019s an edge, the Astros believe, they have it simply because they have home-field advantage. They don\u2019t have to jump on a plane Friday morning for New York. The Yankees have to come to them.\n\nBesides, the Astros still remember back to two years ago when the home team won every game.\n\n\u201cIt feels important, even more important today,\u2019\u2019 Hinch says. \u201cEverybody talks about Game 6 and 7 at the end of the [2017] series. I like the fact that the series is opening up here because we need a partial day off. I'm exhausted after this series.\u2019\u2019\n\nBesides, the Astros believe they have a huge advantage with their quirky ballpark. They know all of the nooks and crannies at Minute Maid Park from the Crawford Boxes in left field to the high rafters with the roof closed.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the Astros set a franchise record by going 60-21 at home, winning 32 of their last 40 and became the first team to win 60 home games since the 1998 Yankees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a different ballpark,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different aesthetic for visiting teams. The crowd is incredible in the playoffs. And we\u2019re comfortable here. It\u2019s like Yankee Stadium, they\u2019re comfortable there.\n\n\u201cHome field advantage is one of those funny things that you can\u2019t really quantify, but it truly exists. We are extremely confident in any ballpark, but when we come home, man, it\u2019s game on.\u2019\u2019\n\nNolan Ryan, the great Hall of Fame pitcher himself, is almost always sitting in the front row.\n\n\u201c[Owner] Jim Crane says, \u201cI\u2019m going to put your dad front row every time Verlander rand Cole pitches,\u2019\u2019 Reid Ryan said, \u201cbecause they tend to pitch better when they know Nolan was watching.\u2019 There is no bigger fan of those guys than my dad.\n\n\u201cTo have he and Verlander on the same staff \u2013 and throw Greinke in there \u2013 the type of excellence we\u2019re able to watch on a nightly basis is incredible.\u2019\u2019\n\nSo, go ahead, grab yourself a seat.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a really good team,\u2019\u2019 says Bregman, whose mother grew up in New York City and was a Yankee fan growing up, \u201cand we\u2019ve got a really good team. I think throughout the year both of us thought we\u2019d have to play each other in the postseason. It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros are trying to win their second World Series championship in three years and believe this team one of the best of all time. Yet, the only way they\u2019ll be remembered, Bregman says, is to win the World Series.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a chance to do something special,\u2019\u2019 Bregman says. \u201cWe won a lot of games. We have All-Stars at every position. But there\u2019s one thing left to do, and that\u2019s to win [the World Series].\u2019\u2019", "description": "Two years after the Astros came out ahead in seven games, the Yankees will get another shot at getting bat to the World Series.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
