No, not that the universe is a cold, empty, meaningless void and that hope and justice are pretty lies told by self-deceived fools.\n\nI mean the other lesson: Don\u2019t underestimate Donald Trump.\n\nAll good lessons, however, are eventually overlearned, especially by once-burned political commentators. In this case, our reticence disguises just how weak Trump really is. While it is absurd at this point to predict anything about the 2020 presidential election, no sane candidate would prefer to be playing Trump\u2019s hand.\n\nThe most recent national election \u2014 the 2018 midterms \u2014 showed strong Democratic enthusiasm and collapsing Republican support in many suburban areas. Take Northern Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District, which Republican Barbara Comstock won in 2016 by nearly six percentage points. In 2018, Comstock lost her seat to a Democrat by 12 points \u2014 a massive swing during the first two years of the Trump presidency. Trump placed the blame on Comstock \u2014 who had sided with Trump nearly 98 percent of the time in House votes \u2014 for being insufficiently enthusiastic about his person. It was a remarkable display of gracelessness and delusion.\n\nThe question arises: What has Trump done during the interval between the midterms and today to change the minds of suburban voters who helped win the House for Democrats in Virginia\u2019s 10th District and elsewhere? The answer occurs: Nothing. Nothing at all.\n\nTrump\u2019s current poll numbers are poor \u2014 in some cases historically poor. Unlike every other recent president, he has never reached a job approval rating of 50 percent according to Gallup. A recent Quinnipiac University poll puts his approval at 38 percent. A recent poll in Virginia by Roanoke College had Trump\u2019s job approval at 27 percent \u2014 an 11-point drop since February.\n\nThere is evidence that his signature political approach \u2014 his mix of rancor and racism \u2014 is alienating women in large numbers. Overall, Trump won white women by two points in 2016. Recent polls have him losing all women by double digits in matchup polls against all the main Democratic contenders. According to 2016 exit polls, Trump won white, working-class women by 27 points. Two recent polls have him up by only seven.\n\nExternal conditions might be turning against Trump. There are signs of weaker economic growth, increasing fears of recession and an apparently endless trade war with China that (according to a recent economic analysis) will cost the average American family $460 over the course of a year. The Quinnipiac poll finds, for the first time, that more Americans think Trump is hurting the economy than helping it. He is already pre-blaming U.S. companies and the Federal Reserve in case economic conditions turn south \u2014 indicating the shape of his worst fears.\n\nAnd internally, the president\u2019s precarious emotional balance seems further unbalanced by adversity. His normal chaos has become whirling, flailing, frothing chaos. He \u201chereby ordered\u201d U.S. companies to cease doing business in China \u2014 transcending the debate between conservative and progressive economics with a dose of fascist economics. He promised pardons to aides who broke the law in building the southern border wall. He used his high office to attack Omarosa Manigualt Newman and Debra Messing. He claimed \u201cFox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d (Truth rating: Pants on Fire!) He suggested one of his properties as the next location for the Group of Seven summit, then defended it against one visitor\u2019s charges of a bedbug infestation. He denied a well-reported news story revealing that he proposed to blow up hurricanes with nuclear weapons. And he tweeted out the almost certainly classified photo of a failed Iranian missile launch. Says one strongly Republican friend: \u201cI\u2019m trying to imagine what would be happening on the right today if [Barack] Obama were president and had tweeted out a classified photograph of an Iranian missile site clearly taken from his intelligence briefing with a stupid comment about it. People would be calling for his impeachment. And yet Trump does it and everyone has an excuse to offer.\u201d\n\nTo win reelection, Trump will need to take and get credit for a strong economy, control his self-destructive tendencies on Twitter and in press availabilities, and draw a very liberal Democratic opponent. The first condition is very much up in the air. The third is in the hands of Democrats. Recent events, however, show that the second condition will almost certainly not be met. Trump seems incapable of carrying forward any political strategy that requires something more than immediate obedience to his rampant impulses.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "description": "No, it\u2019s not that the universe is a cold, empty, meaningless void.", "authors": ["Michael Gerson", "September At Pm", "Michael Gerson Is A Nationally Syndicated Columnist Who Appears Twice Weekly In The Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SkJdvn1XdO__EKLNN2I7Lbe7Kig=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4VGVTVTYEAI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg"}
