It is also under investigation amid allegations of corruption in Africa.\n\nAnd it has run into difficulties in Venezuela where the central bank is having trouble paying its bills.\n\nShareholder Richard Bernstein, whose Crystal Amber investment vehicle owns 6.4 per cent of De La Rue, last night blasted the company.\n\n'There's something very wrong when Martin Sutherland can walk away with a \u00a3197,000 bonus, plus \u00a350,000 to help him find a new job, and then there's a profit warning like this,' he said. 'This is clearly evidence of appalling mismanagement by Sutherland and Rogerson. If there was any justice, that \u00a3247,000 would be distributed among people in Gateshead who lost their jobs.\n\n'At least getting new management in gives some possibilities.'\n\nDe La Rue closed 20.3 per cent lower, down 38p, at 149p.\n\nCatheter and colostomy bag maker Convatec rose 10.8 per cent, or 19.8p, to 202.8p, as growth in four main divisions surged, stoking hopes that the troubled company was on the path to recovery after a shock profit warning last year.\n\nBlue-chip packaging firm Smurfit Kappa clocked a rise after it said revenues were up 3 per cent to \u00a35.9 billion in the first nine months of the year and said it is well-positioned to benefit from the huge increase in demand for sustainable packaging. It ended 2.1 per cent higher, up 54p, at 2596p.\n\nThe FTSE 100 inched up 0.34 per cent, or 24.52 points, to 7330.78 while the FTSE 250 lost 0.26 per cent, or 53.23 points, to 20115.10.\n\nAstrazeneca rose 2.6 per cent, or 193p, to 7580p after it sold the rights to anti-psychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to German group, Cheplapharm Arzneimittel. It will get \u00a3138m upfront but this could rise to as much as \u00a3186m.\n\nShares in a slew of companies moved after new board appointments. Water group Severn Trent rose 0.6 per cent, or 13p, to 2247p after it picked Christine Hodgson, who chairs Capgemini, as its new chairman from next April.\n\nLuxury fashion house Burberry welcomes Diageo's Greater China and Asia Pacific president, Sam Fischer, as non-executive director from November 1. It comes after Burberry has struggled in the region, with unrest in Hong Kong and a slowdown in China. It fell 0.2 per cent, or 3p, to 2052p.\n\nSainsbury's was also in the red after it announced board members Matt Brittin and Jean Tomlin will stand down next year after nine and seven years respectively. Stock fell 2.4 per cent, or 5.1p, to 205.7p.\n\nAnd AIM-listed biotech group Oxford Biodynamics rallied 10.7 per cent, up 11.5p, to 119p, after Glasgow University professor Iain McInnes joined its scientific board. After outsourcer Serco Group won an \u00a3800m contract to escort prisoners between prisons and courts and to look after prisoners while they are at court, it rose 0.9 per cent, or 1.4p, to 156.5p.\n\nSports Direct shed 1.5 per cent, or 4.6p, falling to 313.6p after the company's third rant to the stock market in as many days. Founder Mike Ashley blasted the Competition and Markets Authority for allegedly publishing 'inaccurate estimates' of Sports Direct's market share in the supply of sports-inspired clothing and footwear.", "description": "New boss Clive Vacher, who took over this month following the ousting of Martin Sutherland in May, said full-year profits will be significantly lower than forecast.", "authors": ["Francesca Washtell For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
