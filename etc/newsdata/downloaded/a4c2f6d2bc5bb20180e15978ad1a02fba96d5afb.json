Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee, Eliot Engel of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee - was to subpoena Pompeo and Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani for documents and to summon the five diplomats to testify.\n\n\"Secretary Pompeo was reportedly on the call when the President pressed Ukraine to smear his political opponent,\" they said.\n\nPompeo warned against obstruction\n\nPompeo's letter suggested that the committees could be forced to subpoena the five diplomats, and that the State Department and White House could seek to limit what they can talk about.\n\n\"I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead,\" Pompeo said.\n\nBut news reports said the State Department's former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, would testify on Thursday and that the ex-ambassador to Kiev, Marie Yovanovitch, would appear behind closed doors on October 11.\n\nVolker had been sought by Giuliani to help pressure Zelensky, while Yovanovitch was removed earlier this year as ambassador after she reportedly resisted that effort.\n\nThe three committee heads warned Pompeo in a statement Tuesday that any effort to prevent witnesses from speaking to them was \"illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry\".\n\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani suggested he might not comply with a House subpoena issued on Monday.\n\nGiuliani spent months earlier this year contacting Ukraine officials to encourage them to investigate Biden, whose son had business ties to Ukraine.\n\nTrump attacks Schiff, whistleblower\n\nWhile Pompeo and Giuliani battled the House committees, Trump also stepped up his personal attacks on Schiff, the leader of the impeachment investigation, as well as the anonymous whistleblower.\n\n\"Why isn't Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress,\" he asked.\n\n\"It is just another Democrat Hoax!\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump said the White House was trying to get more information on the whistleblower, whose identity is protected by law.\n\nBut politicians from both parties warned the president against threatening or attempting to unmask the whistleblower, who was reported to be a CIA analyst.", "description": "US President Donald Trump has denounced the impeachment inquiry threatening his presidency as a \"coup\", as his administration pushed back hard against the investigation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9425/86c31808dd85497eb3ded5dd781df00b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
