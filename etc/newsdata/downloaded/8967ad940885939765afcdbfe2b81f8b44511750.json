Hasbro, who acquired the classic game from longtime owner Parker Brothers, even recently released \u201cMonopoly for Millennials and \u201cMonopoly Socialism.\u201d\n\nSo, given the thematic potpourri of the classic brand, it\u2019s not too surprising that game makers have launched yet another iteration, this time with the intent of confronting purported gender wage inequality.\n\nJOSHUA ROGERS: HOW MY MOM PLAYED A BOARD GAME WITH ME \u2014 AND CHANGED MY LIFE\n\n\u201cMs. Monopoly\u201d attempts to do this by paying female players 20 percent more than men. Women who pass \u201cGo\u201d collect $240 as compared with their male counterparts\u2019 $200.\n\nBilling itself as \u201cThe first game where women make more than men,\u201d Ms. Monopoly\u2019s creators may be well-intentioned \u2013 but the underlying premise and presumption behind its claims are vastly overblown or downright inaccurate.\n\nThat\u2019s because claims of gender wage inequality are largely a red herring.\n\nPopularly referred to as the \u201cwage gap,\u201d liberal politicians on the campaign trail regularly hype and lament the fact that when compared to men, women make 80 cents on the dollar.\n\nMs. Monopoly to the rescue! Sorry, not so fast.\n\nMy mom loved to remind me that \u201cFigures often lie, and liars often figure,\u201d and this is certainly true in the case of so-called wage-gap propaganda.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true that on average women make 20 percent less than men, but there are plenty of reasons why, and it has almost nothing to do with misogyny or gender bias.\n\nIT\u2019s true that on average women make 20 percent less than men, but there are plenty of reasons why, and it has almost nothing to do with misogyny or gender bias.\n\nIn fact, a study conducted this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that \u201chours worked\u201d explained half of the gap. In other words, people who work fewer hours per week tend to earn less than those who work more.\n\nOther reasons include types of jobs. For example, liberal activists like to lament gender wage disparity in professional athletics. They overlook the fact that male sports teams earn disproportionally far more revenue than female teams.\n\nAn even more substantial and significant (and related) explanation behind the male-female wage gap has to do with the fact that many women independently choose to either reduce their hours worked or put their careers on hold in order to raise and nurture their children.\n\nWomen who make this choice are aware that doing so financially and professionally impacts their career. After all, anybody, male or female, who dips in and out of the workforce is not likely to be in line for the same promotions or pay raises that await those who remain with the same company or career over an extended period of time.\n\nWomen who make this choice to step away from the workforce or reduce their hours to care for family should be lauded. To be sure, not every woman is able to do so, but those who do shouldn\u2019t be patronized by suggesting they need a handout in order to level the playing field with their male counterparts.\n\nIt\u2019s also pure idiocy to try and address one supposed inequality by instituting another.\n\nMy wife, who has a master\u2019s degree in communications and was an accomplished oboist prior to marrying and raising our three boys, told me she finds the premise behind Ms. Monopoly insulting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI have no doubt that Julie could earn just as much as me if that were her desire. Instead, she has chosen to pursue a career of incalculable value. Homeschooling our boys and navigating their growth and struggles, including dyslexia for two of them, is no small task. The future and fate of America rests on the ability of parents to raise the next generation of kids.\n\nTackling this topic inevitably elicits charges of patriarchy and claims that those of us who celebrate stay-at-home motherhood are somehow caught up in a time warp and would prefer to return to a pre-1960s America, when most mothers didn\u2019t work outside the home.\n\nI\u2019ll plead guilty to preferring children be raised in the safe, secure and loving care of their parents, if possible. And I\u2019m not alone. A 2016 Gallup poll found that 54 percent of mothers who work outside the home would prefer to devote their full-time energies to their families.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt\u2019s been said that life is like a Monopoly board game \u2013 that at the end of our days, after all the moves and acquisitions, after all the successes and setbacks along with the fortunes and the failures - everything goes back in the box.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, and I think the analogy holds, one of the secrets of the good life is to enjoy the journey around the board. And in doing so, from Baltic to Boardwalk Avenues, let\u2019s cheer and celebrate the many mothers of the world who aren\u2019t just raising good kids \u2013 but raising kids who will one day grow up to become great adults.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "Yes, it\u2019s true that on average women make 20 percent\u00a0less than men, but there are plenty of reasons why, and it has almost nothing to do with misogyny or gender bias.", "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
