World steel production and consumption will be lower than previously expected this year and next, it said.\n\nTop steelmakers globally have painted a bleak outlook for the sector as the prolonged trade war drags on growth and a first-half jump in iron ore prices hurt profits. Output in China, which accounts for more than half the world\u2019s steel, faces competing pressures as falling domestic consumption is set against rising export prospects and potential stimulus measures, the report said.\n\nRead more: As China\u2019s Economy Slows, Why the World Should Care\n\nAs well as trade tensions, potential catalysts for a sharper global downturn include slowing U.S. growth, high debt in China, and a deterioration in Germany and other European countries, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science said in the report. The overall effect remains difficult to project as many countries are likely to respond with stimulus measures that typically involve infrastructure development and greater production of steel, it said.\n\nOn the raw materials side, iron ore prices -- that surged to more than $120 a ton this year after a fatal dam disaster in Brazil and supply disruptions in Australia -- are set to fall. The department predicts prices will drop to $57.50 a ton in 2021 and $61.40 in 2020 from an average $80.10 this year as the market returns to balance, maintaining forecasts from its June quarterly report. Projections refer to spot ore with 62% content, FOB Australia\n\nThe view from Australia, the world\u2019s biggest iron ore shipper, joins other bearish outlooks. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Macquarie Group Ltd. rank iron ore among their least-preferred commodity picks and China\u2019s largest manufacturer of special steel products has predicted a drop in prices in 2020.\n\nChina\u2019s iron ore imports are set decline through 2021 and the country\u2019s steel mills will use more scrap, according to the report. Australia\u2019s exports are forecast to contract this year, albeit a smaller decline than previously predicted, before increasing in 2020 and 2021, it said.\n\nFresh evidence of the pressure China\u2019s steelmakers are facing emerged on Monday as the industry\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index showed a contraction for a fourth straight month. The overall gauge was 44.2 for September, well below the level of 50 that\u2019s the dividing line between shrinkage and expansion.\n\nOther forecasts from the report:\n\nWith the supply of high-grade iron ore from Brazil heavily disrupted, Chinese steelmakers have pivoted to lower-grade ores, leading to a reduction in the price premium for higher grades.\n\nVale SA\u2019s assets in northern Brazil continue to operate without issues and could potentially ramp up output through a restart at Brucutu and greater use of dry tailings stackings. At least one-third of the supply cut in the wake of January\u2019s dam disaster is expected to persist for several more years.\n\nVale, and potentially other iron ore producers, will focus on shifting from wet to dry processing over the next three years. While this will divert resources away from other potential expansions and may lead to some drag on Brazilian output in the short term, it is likely to improve stability of global supply in the longer term.\n\nIndia is set to become a significant influence on global iron ore markets as it industrializes. The country is expected to remain a small net importer of iron ore from 2020 onward.\n\n(Updates to add China steel industry PMI in eighth paragraph)", "description": "Steel Outlook Dims as Iron Ore Powerhouse Flags Growth Woes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd44fe6425792ce73cb14bf815055d49e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
