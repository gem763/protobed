Last week, he gave Congress text messages showing he put an adviser for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in touch with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani at the Ukrainian adviser\u2019s request.\n\nTrump, in his July 25 phone call to Zelensky, asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, according to a summary of the call released by The White House.\n\nVolker resigned from the State Department after a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s phone call was made public. The whistleblower mentioned Volker several times in the complaint as having helped Ukrainian leaders \u201cnavigate\u201d the president\u2019s requests and \u201ccontain the damage\u201d to the U.S.\n\nVolker told House members in closed-door testimony last week he wasn\u2019t \u201cfully in the loop\u201d on Trump\u2019s plans.", "description": "The former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine said he feared \"becoming a distraction\" amid scrutiny of President Donald Trump's dealings with the country.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b65f22100002a0433033c.jpeg?cache=4axicbctnp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
