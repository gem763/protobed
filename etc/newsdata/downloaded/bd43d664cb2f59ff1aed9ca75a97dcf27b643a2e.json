(Julio Cortez/Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 The Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 celebration of their National League West title started modestly Tuesday night, with a leisurely, unremarkable gathering on the infield at Camden Yards that looked like any post-win handshake-line. It gained steam as two carts arrived near the mound, and they all stripped to the waist to don commemorative T-shirts and caps \u2014 \u201cOctober Reign,\u201d they said \u2014 then posed for a group picture, the B&O Warehouse looming incongruously in the background.\n\nAnd within an hour, the Dodgers had lain waste to the visitors\u2019 clubhouse, its plastic-covered floor flooded with a half-inch of champagne and beer, everyone within sight now soaked to the bone.\n\nBy this point, the Dodgers are the unrivaled masters of the September champagne celebration.\n\nEvery September, almost without fail, these Dodgers celebrate the clinching of another division title as if it were their first. They have done so in every season since 2013 \u2014 the only exception being 2018, when they clinched on Oct. 1. Otherwise, October has been mostly unkind to the Dodgers, whose six previous trips to the playoffs have ended in two losses each in the World Series, the NL Championship Series and the Division Series.\n\nBut just getting to October with such consistency is an impressive feat on its own; the Dodgers\u2019 run of seven straight division titles is the third-longest of all-time. In this decade, no other franchise comes close to matching it.\n\n\u201cYou come into spring training, and you have that big goal to make it back to the World Series,\u201d veteran third baseman Justin Turner said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t just show up for the World Series \u2014 you\u2019ve got to take the steps to get there, and this is the first step of being able to do that.\u201d\n\n[With homers still flying at record pace, baseball careens toward an October unlike any other]\n\nIf this one felt different, it was because it was the earliest clinch in this run of seven straight titles \u2014 coming after Game 146, with the Dodgers holding an NL-best 94-52 record. It came following a 7-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles, which featured right-hander Walker Buehler tossing seven shutout innings and the Dodgers bashing three homers, two of them by shortstop Corey Seager, to push their season total, already a league record, to 258.\n\n\u201cEverything we do going forward is to win 11 games in October,\u201d Dave Roberts, the Dodgers\u2019 manager for the past four division titles, said. \u201cThe question we\u2019re all going to get asked is, are we going to let our guard down, lose our edge going into the postseason? That\u2019s something I don\u2019t expect from our team, and [Wednesday] we\u2019re going to expect to win a baseball game.\u201d\n\nWith the clincher behind them, the Dodgers now have some three weeks, ahead of Game 1 of the Division Series at Dodger Stadium on Oct. 3, in which to find answers to some of their pressing questions heading into the postseason:\n\nWho, among candidates Hyun-Jin Ryu, Clayton Kershaw and Buehler, is their Game 1 starter? Should 21-year-old phenom shortstop/second baseman Gavin Lux, Baseball America\u2019s minor league player of the year, make the postseason roster? Can converted starters Kenta Maeda, Julio Urias and Tony Gonsolin help build a dependable bridge to closer Kenley Jansen? And is Jansen, muddling through the worst season of his career, even the best choice to pitch the ninth inning?\n\nAnd in the meantime, the Dodgers still have something to play for, as they enter Wednesday trailing the New York Yankees and Houston Astros by one game in the race for the majors\u2019 best record and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. (On the NL side of the bracket, they lead the Atlanta Braves by four games.) This is no small matter given the Dodgers\u2019 56-20 record at home this season.\n\n\u201cJust short of all-in,\u201d Roberts said when asked how motivated the Dodgers would be to secure home-field advantage, over the opposite motivation to rest their regulars. \u201cI think it\u2019s certainly very important considering how we\u2019ve played at home. But there\u2019s still a cost in everything, and I think the main thing is keeping guys healthy, keeping guys sharp, and not trying to redline just to win by any means necessary. If we play to our potential, that should take care of itself.\u201d\n\nBut those are all issues for another day. This moment, between Tuesday night\u2019s raucous celebration and the coming tumult of October, is a perfect time to take a step back and appreciate what these Dodgers have accomplished.\n\nTheir seven straight division titles, assuming this year\u2019s margin remains around its current 18\u00bd games, will have come by an average of more than eight games over the second-place finisher. Only three players, all of them pitchers \u2014 Kershaw, Ryu and Jansen \u2014 have been with the franchise for all seven titles.\n\nThe glaring lack of a World Series title to validate this run, of course, looms large over this franchise, which hasn\u2019t won it all since 1988. But this fall brings another opportunity, and it is worth pondering what a championship would do for the legacy of this group. With next month bringing the final World Series of the 2010s, the Dodgers are a championship away from inserting themselves into a fascinating team-of-the-decade debate.\n\nAt the most fundamental level, the race for Team of the 2010s was decided before the decade was half over, given the San Francisco Giants\u2019 World Series titles in 2010, 2012 and 2014. (Curiously, though, they will end the decade with only two division titles; their 2014 World Series win came as a wild card.) The Boston Red Sox could also make a strong case, despite this year\u2019s disappointment, with championships in 2013 and 2018 and a total of four division titles.\n\n[As MLB managers skew younger, Giants\u2019 Bruce Bochy takes an archetype into retirement]\n\nBut what if the Dodgers go on to win the World Series this fall? Their team-of-the-decade case would look like this:\n\n* The seven division titles, all of them consecutive \u2014 topped only by the 14 straight of the 1991-2005 Atlanta Braves and the nine straight of the 1998-2006 New York Yankees \u2014 and three more than anyone else during the 2010s.\n\n* Three straight pennants, the most since the 1998-2001 Yankees (four) and the most by an NL team since the 1942-44 Cardinals (three).\n\n* A single World Series title \u2014 again, we are pondering a hypothetical here \u2014 would still pale against the Giants\u2019 three and the Red Sox\u2019s two. But by every other objective measure, a one-championship Dodgers team would have a strong case. One of those measures: consistency. The Red Sox, in between titles, have suffered three sub-.500 seasons in this decade; the Giants are on their way to a third. But the Dodgers\u2019 only losing season this decade came when they went 80-82 in 2010.\n\nThere is a long way to go \u2014 those 11 wins in October \u2014 before the Dodgers can make their argument. But the only way to win the ultimate prize is to keep putting yourself in position to do so, and if the Dodgers keep spraying champagne in September, chances are they will eventually do so in the waning days of October.\n\nRead more on MLB:\n\nChristian Yelich, reigning National League MVP, out for the season with fractured kneecap\n\nAs more MLB parks extend netting, foul ball victims urge minor league teams to do the same\n\nMaking his debut after long journey, an MLB pitcher found his brother waiting at the plate", "description": "They've won the National League West for seven straight seasons, but they need to break out the champagne in late October to contend for team of the decade.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer", "September At Am", "Dave Sheinin Has Been A Washington Post Sports Writer Since Before Working At The Post", "He Covered Golf", "Florida Gators Football", "Major League Baseball For The Miami Herald."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/updSvCgTUD64px4y-TADcyPu9tE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWZ2CWWUIUI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
