The makers of the iconic tinned pie are joining in on the meat-free food trend to launch a soy version of their steak and kidney snack\n\nOriginally from the eponymous port in Uruguay, the piemakers worked closely with PETA to launch the latest dish - which took home the best pie gong at the industry award show, despite not having been launched yet.\n\nThe pies, which are baked in Fochabers, Moray, in Scotland will go on sale at the end of December, in time for Veganaury.\n\nFray Bentos has not yet revealed how much they cost, or where they'll be available.\n\nIt's a landmark departure from meat-only offerings, with a range that currently includes Steak and Kidney, Minced Beef and Onion, Just Chicken Pie, Chicken & Bacon and Chilli Beef Pie.\n\nThe PETA Vegan awards recognised the most exciting vegan offerings on the market today.\n\nThe pressure group said that the number of vegans in the UK will rise by 327 per cent next year as they marked 24 awards with honours going to Greggs, Caffe Nero, Zizzi and Starbucks.\n\nIt comes after the brand launched a Vegetarian Balti in March, which is packed with potato, onion, red pepper, tomato, carrot and peas in a spicy balti sauce, topped with puff pastry\n\nDawn Carr, PETA Director of Vegan Corporate Projects, said of the launch: 'Growing concerns about health, the environment, and animal suffering are driving more and more people to choose vegan options'\n\nThe forward-thinking businesses we've honoured this year have all responded to the booming demand with delicious, plant-based foods that appeal to vegans and meat-eaters alike.'\n\nFray Bentos is responding to demand from customers and has followed in the footsteps of Greggs, which introduced its controversial - and surprisingly popular - vegan sausage roll on January 3 to mark the beginning of Veganuary.\n\nThe bakery chain launched its \u00a31 snack after a petition by animal welfare group Peta last year.\n\nThe Quorn-filled roll turned out to be a huge success, flying off the shelves across the country to become the fastest-selling new line in six years.\n\nFray Bentos takes its names from the port in cow-rearing country Uruguay, where it was originally produced.\n\nIt has a special place in the hearts of millions of Brits, many of whom have a tin lurking at the back of their kitchen cupboards for emergencies.", "description": "The makers of the much-loved tinned pies are joining in on the growing demand for plant-based alternatives, with a vegan  steak and kidney snack made with soy mince and butter-free pastry.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/21/19222840-0-image-a-20_1570047483406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
