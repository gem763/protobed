In May, Biden held the high ground, commanding support from 41 per cent of Democrats nationally. Just a few months later, his share has fallen to 26 per cent. Nearly a third of voters who supported Biden four months ago now support another candidate. The main beneficiaries of Biden\u2019s decline? Sanders and Warren.\n\nWarren\u2019s rise is bolstered by strong debate performances and massive rally crowds. According to political prediction market PredictIt, Warren is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Much of Warren\u2019s success comes from the strength of her policy arguments \u2013 so far she has avoided the \u2018moderate vs. progressive\u2019 arguments that wrap other candidates into knots.\n\nSanders is struggling to recapture the momentum of his 2016 campaign, but has maintained solid standings in a slew of recent state and national polls. The promised Sanders summer surge never materialized, but with over $18 million available and a formidable national network, Sanders can afford to sit in second place as competitors struggle for increasingly focused donor cash.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut can the progressive wing of the Democratic Party survive a potential Warren vs. Sanders matchup so soon after finding its voice?\n\nOn the surface, Sanders and Warren are obvious allies. Both champion congressional Green New Deal legislation. Both have made healthcare a tentpole of their campaigns. Both have aggressively campaigned for the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, arguably the most influential progressive Democrat not on the presidential debate stage.\n\nWarren and Sanders have avoided directly attacking each other so far, but as moderate candidates exit the field, each will face growing pressure to lay sole claim to the enthusiasm \u2013 and votes \u2013 of the party\u2019s energized progressive base.\n\nFor Sanders, \u201cBernie Bros\u201d still pose a unique problem. Those largely male supporters gained a nightmare reputation in 2016 due to the misogynistic attacks they lobbed at Clinton and any critics of Sanders-style Democratic Socialism. That Warren is ideologically far closer to Sanders than to Clinton makes no difference for those in the \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d crowd.\n\nRepeating the scorched-earth Bernie Bro tactics of 2016 may backfire disastrously with a Democratic base subjected to years of Donald Trump\u2019s verbal assaults against women. Bernie Bros remain a major part of the Bernie Sanders cultural experience. Whether he can instill enough discipline in them to avoid an open party war remains to be seen.\n\nThe problem is greater than just overzealous, ill-mannered men. The 2020 Democratic field overflows with qualified women \u2013 but Sanders supporters have shifted the goalposts once again. In 2016, Sanders supporters like Susan Sarandon said they would happily vote for a woman \u2013 just not centrist Hillary Clinton. Sarandon held up Elizabeth Warren as her ideal candidate. Three years later, with Warren now an option, Sarandon drew fire for telling a Sanders rally that Warren was essentially unfit for the job.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Now he risks being eclipsed by Warren, who combines Sanders\u2019s populist message with more\n\ncharisma and stronger policy bona fides.\n\nJust this week, Sanders lost a major endorsement from the progressive Working Families Party to Elizabeth Warren. WFP National Director Maurice Mitchell said the organization decided to make an early endorsement partly to head off a potential progressive vs. progressive war of attrition.\n\nMitchell isn\u2019t the only progressive activist worried about what a Sanders/Warren fight might mean for the left. After the Working Families Party announcement, The Atlantic reported that a growing number of Sanders supporters are moving to Warren to defuse a brewing civil war over who ought to lead progressives into 2020.\n\nThe idea of a progressive Democratic base strong enough to foment a primary crisis seemed like a fantasy in 2016. One cycle later and voters are faced with an abundance of choice on the left \u2013 on everything from healthcare policy to climate change and criminal justice reform. All that remains is for them to unite behind a single voice.\n\nThat choice may prove harder than they anticipated. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t lead to a replay of 2016.", "description": "Democratic insiders have worried for months that polls may be overstating Joe Biden\u2019s advantage over a resurgent left led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
