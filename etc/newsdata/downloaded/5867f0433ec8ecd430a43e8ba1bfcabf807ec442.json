Honey, I love you,\" Soria told reporters in the capital Quito.\n\nHe urged other gays to stop hiding and \"enjoy the happiness that comes from being equal, like anyone else\".\n\n'A big yes'\n\nEcuador's current constitution defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman.\n\nThe charter, ratified in 2008, also bars same-sex couples from adopting children.\n\nBut the judges that approved same-sex marriage said they based their decision on the idea that all people are equal. They also said they sought to counter any kind of discrimination.\n\nIn Foch Plaza in downtown Quito, two women who have been fighting since 2013 for the right to marry staged a symbolic wedding right after the court decision was announced.\n\nPamela Troya and Gabriela Correa sat formally in chairs for the ceremony and when Troya was asked the big question, she said: \"Today, I say yes. A big yes. A giant yes. I want to be your wife.\"\n\nOthers in the crowd shouted in approval, hugged and kissed.\n\nTroya later told reporters the fight for same sex marriage in Ecuador had been long and hard, and at times she thought it was a lost cause.\n\n\"Finally, today is an historic day for Ecuador because it is a little more fair and egalitarian,\" she said.", "description": "Ecuador's highest court has approved same-sex marriage in a landmark ruling in the traditionally Catholic and conservative South American country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7816/d190f908845a4456838f99d64d90fc7e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
