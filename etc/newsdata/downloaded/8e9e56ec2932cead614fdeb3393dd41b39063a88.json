Boelt and the town of Hj\u00f8rring also have chipped in to foot the bill.\n\nThe move is expected to last 10 hours, at a speed of eight metres per hour. The building in its original position was at risk from erosion and shifting sands.\n\nThe lighthouse ceased operating in 1968, when sands eventually buried two adjacent buildings, and was briefly turned into a museum. It still attracts more than 250,000 visitors each year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 2015 sandstorm at the Rubjerg Knude lighthouse.

Thirty minutes into the operation, the lighthouse had been moved 1.4 metres.\n\nIn 2008, a nearby church was dismantled to prevent it from falling into the sea. The Romanesque M\u00e5rup church, built in about 1250 on a cliff, was used as one of the filming locations for the 1987 film Babette\u2019s Feast, which became the first Danish film to win an Academy award for best foreign language film.", "description": "Rubjerg Knude used to be 200 metres away from coast before sand shifting and erosion", "authors": ["Associated Press In Copenhagen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77dfa0e506ab5b385fb3e23e9232d260e0cfd97d/0_88_4797_2879/master/4797.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0bf9ec9ab968aa53c42849cc5d9f6329", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
