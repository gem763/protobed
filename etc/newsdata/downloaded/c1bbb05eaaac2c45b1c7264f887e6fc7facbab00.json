Three other politicians were fined and suspended from public office for disobedience.\n\nThe Spanish government had expressed the hope that the Supreme Court verdict would usher in a new phase in this crisis, in which a political solution could be reached.\n\nBut such optimism currently looks fanciful and although support for independence has dipped recently, according to Catalan government polls, it remains relatively high at 44%, according to a July study. That compares to a record high of 49% in December 2017.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption A new civic group called Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic spearheaded Monday's airport protest which cancelled flights and led to police storming protesters\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Crowds thronged the airport inside and out\n\nOpposition to the Supreme Court's handling of the independence case has long been seen as a common cause around which the independence movement could unite after suffering some severe divisions. Yet now the verdict is out, it is not entirely clear where the response to it is leading.\n\n\"Outrage at the verdicts is very broad and it's shared by everyone within the independence movement,\" says Francesc-Marc \u00c1lvaro, a columnist at La Vanguardia newspaper.\n\n\"But the independence movement does not have a new shared strategy in the wake of the verdict.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Spanish police charged late on Monday at protesters organised by Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic\n\nThe region's pro-independence president, Quim Torra, has encouraged Catalans to exercise civil disobedience. Yet his government is also responsible for the regional police who are charged with controlling demonstrations, putting him in an uncomfortable position.\n\nMany believe that Mr Torra's hopes of forcing Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to the negotiating table, to discuss the holding of a formal independence referendum, are misplaced.\n\nThe prime minister faces substantial pressure from unionists in Madrid to take a firm stance on the Catalan issue. National politics is deeply polarised, particularly so with a general election approaching on 10 November.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is the status of a new, mysterious, civic movement called Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, which appeared to be behind some of Monday's more dramatic protest actions.\n\nIt also put its name to a video message recorded in English by Manchester City football club's Catalan coach, Pep Guardiola, in which he accused Spain of drifting \"towards authoritarianism\". In its tweet, the group erroneously said Guardiola's statement had been broadcast by the BBC.\n\nThat seemed to underline Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic's aim of bringing this crisis to international attention. However, an end to it is not yet in sight.", "description": "Roads and rail links were severed and protests erupted after Catalan leaders were jailed for sedition.", "authors": ["Guy Hedgecoe", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r1x0m.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
