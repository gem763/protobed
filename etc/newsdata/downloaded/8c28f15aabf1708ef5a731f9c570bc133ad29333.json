talks with EU appear on verge of collapse", "language": "en", "text": "London (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union appeared to be on the verge of collapse on Tuesday, with Brussels accusing London of intransigence and threatening the bloc\u2019s future.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said a deal was \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d without compromise by the UK, according to a Downing Street source.\n\nShe warned that any deal was \u201cessentially impossible\u201d if London failed to give ground on the thorny Irish border question and keep British-run Northern Ireland in the EU customs union, the source added.\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on October 31, more than three years after the country narrowly voted in a referendum to end its almost five-decade membership of the bloc.\n\nJohnson, who once said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than seek a Brexit extension \u2014 submitted new plans last week in place of an agreement his predecessor Theresa May struck with Brussels in late 2018.\n\nThe UK parliament, which is deeply divided over Brexit, rejected that plan three times.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Downing Street believes talks between the two sides are now \u201cclose to breaking down\u201d.\n\nIn Berlin, Merkel\u2019s office confirmed the chancellor spoke by telephone to Johnson but said it would not comment \u201con such confidential discussions\u201d.\n\nJohnson\u2019s official spokesman told reporters the pair had a \u201cfrank exchange\u201d and that discussions were at a \u201ccritical point\u201d.\n\nBut he rejected an accusation from EU Council president Donald Tusk\u2019 that Johnson was playing \u201csome stupid blame game\u201d.\n\nTusk tweeted: \u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interest of our people.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d Tusk asked, using the Latin expression for \u201cwhere are you headed?\u201d.\n\nMuch of the focus in both London and Brussels is shifting to what happens next, as a crunch EU summit approaches next week \u2014 and who would be to blame for a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank meanwhile warned that \u201ceven a relatively benign no-deal Brexit\u201d would see Britain\u2019s debt burden surge to 50-year highs.\n\nOn the markets, the pound lost around 0.5 percent of its value against the dollar within moments of Downing Street\u2019s comments.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No more delay\u2019 \u2013\n\nJohnson\u2019s proposals outline a new way to avoid a hard border between EU member the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.\n\nIt would take Northern Ireland out of the EU\u2019s customs union but keep it largely aligned with the bloc\u2019s \u201csingle market\u201d standards and regulations.\n\nEU officials said this would not remove the need for customs checks \u2014 a deal-breaker because it jeopardises the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe agreement effectively created an invisible border between north and south, satisfying republicans who want a united Ireland and unionists who want to keep the status quo.\n\nKeeping the border open and free-flowing has become a key sticking point in the Brexit talks.\n\nDowning Street officials say Brussels is making a big mistake because failure in the coming days to reach a deal would result in Britain\u2019s position only hardening down the line.\n\nOne source in Johnson\u2019s office told The Spectator magazine the government will try to \u201cdo all sorts of things\u201d to prevent another Brexit delay should negotiations really collapse.\n\nJohnson has said Britain will leave the EU on October 31 \u201cdeal or no deal \u2014 but no delay\u201d, despite legislation that requires him to request another postponement if no agreement is struck.\n\nScotland\u2019s top civil court was expected to rule Tuesday whether it could force someone else \u2014 possibly a judge \u2014 to sign the extension request if Johnson does not.\n\nBut should a delay still be granted at the EU summit, Johnson will campaign for a \u201cno-deal\u201d in a snap general election, the Downing Street source told The Spectator, which supports the ruling Conservative party.\n\n\u201cIf this deal dies in the next few days, then it won\u2019t be revived,\u201d the source added in what was said to be a series of lengthy text messages.\n\nDowning Street did not comment on the story.\n\nThe same source also warned that EU countries which were against further delays to Brexit would \u201cgo to the front of the queue for future cooperation\u201d.\n\nThose who support further delays would \u201cgo to the bottom of the queue\u201d, including on security issues, the sourced added.", "description": "London (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union appeared to be on the verge of collapse on Tuesday,
