Last week, he gave interviews claiming that he tried to save them from the blaze.\n\nWilber Romero, 26, (second right) was arrested on Friday on murder and arson charges for allegedly setting a fire which killed his parents, Jose and Nicolasa (center), his younger sister Iris, 21, (also center) and which put his 24-year-old sister Wendy (far left) and younger brother Angel, who is now 17, (far right) in the hospital\n\nWilber said in interviews last week that he was sleeping outside when the fire began and that he screamed for help\n\nMany of the details remain unknown, but family friends say Wilber survived because he was sleeping outside at the time.\n\nIn an interview with KGTV, he said: 'My dogs were jumping on me, trying to wake me up. I woke up. When I woke up, my bed was on fire.\n\n'I jumped out of bed and started screaming the house is on fire.'\n\nPolice have revealed harrowing details of how some of the family tried to escape including how the sister who died, Iris, used her body as a human shield to protect her younger brother Angel.\n\nWendy banged on a door so hard to try and escape that she broke fingers.\n\nThe fire began at around 4.30am at the family's home on October 13.\n\nThis was all that remained of the family's home after the October 13 fire. It tore through the building at around 4.30am\n\nNicolasa, 46, died in the hospital. Iris, 21, used herself as a human shield to protect her younger brother from the flames.
