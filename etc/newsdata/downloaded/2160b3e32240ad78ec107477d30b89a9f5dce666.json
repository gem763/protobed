He put Forge ahead on the brink of halftime, tapping it in at the back post after a beautiful backheel from Chris Nanco allowed Kwame Awuah to send a pass across goal.\n\nHolding onto the lead became more difficult for Forge midway through the second frame, as centre-back Dominic Samuel came flying into a tackle on a falling Jose Escalante, earning himself a second yellow card.\n\nThe ejection comes as a major blow to the Hammers, who will now be without both Samuel and his fellow defender Bertrand Owundi for the first leg of Finals 2019.\n\nForge will host the first leg of the finals Oct. 26 in Hamilton, while the series will shift back to Calgary for the second leg on Nov. 2.\n\nYork9 face Valour FC and Pacific FC take on FC Edmonton later Wednesday.", "description": "Forge FC closed out their regular season campaign in style on Wednesday as they downed their fellow Canadian Premier League Finals combatants, Cavalry FC, 1-0 at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, Ont.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323868.1571274770!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/soc-concacaf-olimpia-forge-20190822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
