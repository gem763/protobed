Yet on Monday night he made it apparent that he actually bows down to the Chinese Communist Party. Just when it finally looked as if the media cycle was moving past the NBA's kowtowing to China after numerous league players and coaches condemned Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey for tweeting a picture in support of Hong Kong protesters last week, Lebron decided to enter the fray by saying that Morey was selfish and uneducated for voicing his support for democracy.\n\n\"We all talk about this freedom of speech, yes, we all do have freedom of speech but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself,\" James said on Monday night. (emphasis added)\n\nLakers\u2019 LeBron James on NBA\u2019s China controversy: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a ... feud with Daryl Morey but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.\u201d pic.twitter.com/KKrMNU0dKR \u2014 Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) October 15, 2019\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to get into a feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, and spiritually,\" he remarked. (emphasis added)\n\nThe Daily Caller's Peter Hasson pointed out that all Morey tweeted was a graphic saying, \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\"\n\nReminder that this was the extent of Daryl Morey's tweet pic.twitter.com/hmSw3M1TaL \u2014 Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) October 15, 2019\n\nRightfully so, folks from all across the political spectrum tore into James for his ignorant comments about China's human rights abuses.\n\nEducate us then, @KingJames. What do you know about China that we don\u2019t? We know about the Chinese imprisonment, torture & execution of Christians and Muslims. We know about the jailing of dissenters. We know the violent threats toward Hong Kong. What are we missing, Wise One? https://t.co/tOPdHng3xm \u2014 Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) October 15, 2019\n\nClearly @KingJames is the one who isn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see him join the chorus kowtowing to Communist China & putting profits over human rights for #HongKong. I was there 2 weeks ago. They\u2019re fighting for freedom & the autonomy they were promised. https://t.co/tVI1XB7g6I \u2014 Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) October 15, 2019\n\nLeBron James is on China's side? https://t.co/9fOUdQqihl \u2014 Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) October 15, 2019\n\n.@KingJames \u2014 you\u2019re parroting communist propaganda. China is running torture camps and you know it. #GoogleUyghurs https://t.co/BExRpi02EB \u2014 Senator Ben Sasse (@SenSasse) October 15, 2019\n\nWhen @KingJames was quoting MLK he didn't mean \"everywhere\" everywhere, just the places that can't impact his net worth. #ScrewTheNBA #Hypocrite pic.twitter.com/x42AvHwrVe \u2014 Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) October 15, 2019\n\nBut Lebron decided to double down on Twitter, saying that it has been a tough week for him and his fellow millionaire athletes. For him, he says Morey's tweet was just poor timing. By poor timing, he means that supporting oppressed Hong Kongers got in the way of earning more money.\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nWell, it looks Lebron needs to listen to his own advice and educate himself on China. Guy shared the following video for \"King James\" to understand how his communist pals subjugate helpless individuals in China.", "description": ".10/15/2019 0:24:56AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/283/0c774703-d7f9-4ce8-a075-cae02260be16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
