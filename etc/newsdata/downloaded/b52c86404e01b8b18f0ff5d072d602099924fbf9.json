The Texas energy giant says it did nothing wrong and indeed is an industry leader in gauging potential climate costs.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Exxon essentially kept two sets of books - telling the public that it was taking into account the costs of potential future climate regulations, while lowballing those costs behind the scenes as it made investment decisions and assessed the value of its oil and gas reserves.\n\nThe attorney general's office argues the discrepancy misled investors about the company's exposure to climate costs.\n\nFormer Exxon CEO and ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified Wednesday in a securities fraud lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general's office\n\nThe trial, which started last week, seeks $476million to $1.6billion in damages for shareholders. But the money isn't all that's at stake: The case could be a bellwether for how investors view oil and gas companies' prospects in light of global warming and the new regulations it's expected to spur.\n\nTillerson said that Irving, Texas-based Exxon took climate change seriously. 'We knew it was a real issue,' he testified Wednesday.\n\nDuring his roughly 10-year tenure as CEO, the company supported the concept of a carbon tax, backed the international Paris agreement on combating climate change and in 2007 created a system that tries to predict how regulations worldwide might reduce demand for oil and gas, he noted.\n\n'We tried to understand how this was going to affect everything,' he said.\n\nHe said the company had two sets of climate-risk calculations - one for the broad-level 'proxy costs,' another for 'greenhouse gas costs' to figure how local regulations might affect specific projects - in order to get the 'best assessment.'\n\nExxonMobil Corp is accused of deceiving investors about its future profitability and about the company's exposure to climate change\n\nAsked why carbon costs were figured differently in the two metrics, he said 'they were for different uses within the organization.'\n\nThe case has revealed that Tillerson used the email alias 'Wayne Tracker' while at Exxon.\n\nThe attorney general's office may seek to question him about whether it was used to discuss climate change.\n\nThe company says the account was just a way to streamline communications among top Exxon executives.\n\nThe Texas oilman left a career at Exxon to serve as President Donald Trump's first secretary of state, from February 2017 until Trump fired him by tweet little over a year later.\n\nThe two had been at odds over various issues, including global warming. Tillerson had opposed Trump's plan to pull the Paris accord.", "description": "Former Exxon\u00a0CEO and ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified Wednesday in a securities fraud lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general's office.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/17/20387702-0-image-a-40_1572456172491.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
