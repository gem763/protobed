That would be a good way to start. Let's have equal pay first.'\n\nK\u00e9ll\u00e9, 44, pointed out that by their 60s women have an average of \u00a351,000 in their pension pots - a third of what a man has, which is \u00a3156,000.\n\nShe was adamant that the retirement age shouldn't be raised, saying: 'I think it should remain the same I think it should be 60, I don't think it should be 65.'\n\nOne furious user claimed: 'Women want equality, yet they don\u2019t want the same retirement age as men, because that\u2019s how equality works.'\n\nSinger and actress K\u00e9ll\u00e9 also insisted that equality should be 'across the board' if the retirement age has been made equal to men's\n\nAnother commented: 'I suppose if I was a woman, I'd want my cake and eat it too, if I could. #thatsLife'.\n\nA third raged: 'Of course the retirement age for men and women should be equal. Women have it much easier than men and they live longer.'.\n\nSinger and actress K\u00e9ll\u00e9 insisted that equality should be 'across the board' and went on to point out that some women's working lives are restricted due to the strain of having children.\n\nThe state pension: Questions and answers What are the changes to women\u2019s state pension age? The plan to raise the women\u2019s state pension age from 60 to 65 to bring it in line with men was first revealed in the 1995 Pensions Act. In 2007 it was decided that the pensionable age for men and women would rise to 66 by April 2026. This deadline was brought forward in 2011 so that the retirement age for both sexes will be 66 by October 2020. It will rise to 67 by 2028. What was the legal challenge? Most campaigners support pension age equality, but say it was introduced unlawfully. They have argued that women were not adequately informed about the changes or given enough time to adjust. The changes to the state pension age affect all women born after April 6, 1950. But those born after April 6, 1953 \u2013 who are now in their early 60s \u2013 are hit especially hard. Some have lost out on up to \u00a350,000. The BackTo60 group argued that women born during the 1950s took time out of work to care for children, were paid less than men and could not save as much in occupational pensions, so the change had hit them harder. It is estimated that 3.8 million women are in this position. What was the High Court judgment? Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple dismissed the women\u2019s case on all grounds. The judges said the Government was under no obligation to notify the women. They said there was no discrimination based on age and even if there had been it could be justified by the objective of achieving a fair and affordable pension system. They said the new laws in fact corrected historic discrimination against men by levelling the state pension age. What happens next? Campaigners have vowed to fight on and say they will ask Parliament to intervene. If they pursue their legal challenge, the case will go to the Court of Appeal, and possibly the Supreme Court.\n\nShe said: 'If we're gonna talk about equality, let's make it across the board so we make the same amount of money.\n\n'We've got to think about the things like we have children. I'm not saying we're the weaker sex, but it's different. We have a different like experience to men.\n\n'We have children, we're the primary child care givers, and so therefore there are different stresses and pressures - and also the amount of time that we can psychically work for.\n\nHowever trolls continued to rage about the debate - with one branding her a 'has been' and saying she wants equality that 'suits her'\n\n'Carrying a child for nine months for a start, then I've got to give birth to that child. I've got to breastfeed that child, there's time I've taken off work.'\n\nHowever, viewers continued to rage about the debate - with one saying she wants equality that 'suits her'.\n\nAnother said: 'Some Women want equality, but only on things that suit them.'\n\nA third added: 'You wanted equality! Stop moaning because you have to work to a later age! Us men just have to get on with it!'", "description": "Loose Women panelists have been accused of hypocrisy after claiming women should get to retire earlier than men - to make up for not being paid equally during their working lives.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19297024-0-image-a-124_1570193582923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
