Baker later said of the encounter: \u2018She\u2019s a really nice girl, Germaine. I\u2019ve always thought the world of her.\u2019\n\nBaker repeatedly lost or burned through the millions he made. He battled heroin addiction for decades, went through four marriages, and launched a series of failed business ventures in exotic corners of the world after tiring of performing.\n\nHe had to leave a music studio he launched in Nigeria after being shot at by police, his olive tree orchard in Italy after falling out with the mafia, and the polo ranch he ran in South Africa after being defrauded by a young bank clerk said to have been his lover.\n\nBorn in south-east London Baker (centre) taught himself drumming and found global fame and fortune with \u2018supergroup\u2019 Cream alongside Eric Clapton (left) and Jack Bruce (right)\n\nAnd while he is revered as a founding father of heavy metal, he sneered that the genre should have been \u2018aborted\u2019.\n\nHe once shouted: \u2018I hate f****** rock music. It\u2019s so banal. I\u2019m a jazz drummer.\n\n\u2018You have to swing. There are hardly any rock drummers I know who can do that.\u2019\n\nBaker repeatedly lost or burned through the millions he made during his career\n\nLast night Sir Paul McCartney led tributes, saying: \u2018Ginger Baker, great drummer, wild and lovely guy. Sad to hear he died, but the memories never will.\u2019 Ironically, famously arrogant Baker \u2013 whose autobiography was entitled Hellraiser: The Autobiography Of The World\u2019s Greatest Drummer \u2013 had himself mocked McCartney for being unable to read music, while describing his Beatles bandmate George Harrison as \u2018a musical moron\u2019.\n\nBaker\u2019s daughter Nettie confirmed on Saturday that he had died peacefully after being critically ill in hospital for some weeks. He had two daughters and a son.\n\nIn recent years he had been living in a modest detached house in Kent after returning from South Africa short of cash following a bank fraud and series of court cases. He had endured serious heart problems for three years, and had long suffered deafness, which he blamed on over-loud performances.\n\nHe was born Peter Baker in Lewisham in 1939, weeks before the outbreak of war. When he was just four his father was killed while serving with the RAF.\n\nBaker\u2019s daughter Nettie confirmed on Saturday that he had died peacefully after being critically ill in hospital for some weeks. Pictured left to right: Bruce, Clapton and Baker\n\nTen years later, the youngster was handed a letter his father had written to him. It told him: \u2018Your fists are your best pals.\u2019\n\nHe seemingly took the message to heart, partly by being always ready for a fight \u2013 but also by using those fists to grip the drumsticks that made his name. Baker had told how he had always enjoyed beating out rhythms on his desk at school, but his first passion was cycling, and his first job was in the art department of an advertising agency.\n\nAmong countless conquests of women he termed \u2018tasty chicks\u2019, including a foursome with three groupies of guitarist Jimi Hendrix, he even bedded feminist academic Germaine Greer (pictured in 1968)\n\nAfter wrecking his bike in a crash in London, a friend suggested he try drumming. When he did so with a kit at a jazz club, his very first un-tutored effort, one of the professional band members turned to another and said: \u2018Christ, we\u2019ve got a drummer.\u2019\n\nHe bought himself a toy drum kit for \u00a33 and soon turned professional aged 17 and gave up his day job. Before long he was a regular at Ronnie Scott\u2019s club in Soho. It was on London\u2019s jazz scene in the 1950s that he was introduced, on the same night, to African rhythms and to heroin. Both were to remain an obsession for decades. He only gave up heroin for good when living on his Tuscan olive farm in 1981, after 29 failed attempts to quit.\n\nAlready well-known for his wind-milling musicianship, Baker graduated to rock stardom in 1966 when he formed Cream with Clapton and Bruce. They gave themselves the name because they believed themselves to be \u2018the cream\u2019 of musical talent. At times they outsold the Beatles, with hits including Sunshine of Your Love, I Feel Free and Strange Brew, with Baker\u2019s extended drum solos a key feature. Yet after just two years they had broken up.\n\nBaker fell out with Bruce for decades, furious at earning less money than him from royalties, and even blaming him for the band\u2019s huge banks of speakers and his hearing loss. Cream lucratively reformed, briefly, in 2005, but never again.\n\nAlready well-known for his wind-milling musicianship, Baker (centre) graduated to rock stardom in 1966 when he formed Cream with Clapton (left) and Bruce (right)\n\nAfter Cream, Baker played alongside Clapton again in the short-lived band Blind Faith, with Steve Winwood as singer-keyboardist. He later played with John \u2018Jonny Rotten\u2019 Lydon\u2019s band Public Image Ltd.\n\nBut much of the last half century of his life was consumed by his wild love-life and business adventures. The spirit of his life was captured by an award-winning cinema biography released in 2013. Entitled \u2018Beware of Mr Baker\u2019 after a sign he put up at his polo ranch in South Africa, it opened with him whacking the director in the face with his walking stick, breaking his nose and chasing him into his car, after hearing that the film would feature interviews with old bandmates.\n\nDespite being likened in looks in his later years to Albert Steptoe, he was long popular with the opposite sex. He and first wife Liz once enjoyed a threesome with the girlfriend of one of his bandmates. He boasted in his autobiography that he had a foursome with three members of Hendrix\u2019s harem.\n\nClapton, Baker and Bruce (pictured left to right) gave themselves the name because they believed themselves to be \u2018the cream\u2019 of musical talent\n\nAnd after catching the eye of rising feminist Germaine Greer in the crowd at one of his gigs in 1969, she became another surprising notch on his bedpost.\n\nThe first marriage to Liz ended when he began an affair with his daughter\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s sister, called Sarah, aged 18. They eloped to Tuscany, and married in 1983. He divorced her after finding she had cheated on him.\n\nAt the age of 50 he was living in California \u2013 though barred from permanent residence in the US thanks to several drug convictions \u2013 and he married for the third time to Karen, the young blonde friend of his hairdresser. It soon ended acrimoniously. When he refused to pay her after their divorce, she kept his gold discs.\n\nBaker (centre) fell out with Bruce (right) for decades, furious at earning less money than him from royalties, and even blaming him for the band\u2019s huge banks of speakers and his hearing loss\n\nHe moved on to South Africa to launch a polo farm, but was fleeced by a bank clerk young enough to be his daughter, and who claimed to have been his lover, Lindiwe Noko. She was found guilty of fraud, but he never got his cash back. He had an affair with a prostitute before in 2010 taking his fourth wife, yet another South African woman, again many decades his junior, Kudzai Machokoto. When he returned to Britain several years ago, she accompanied him.\n\nWhatever the ups and downs of his businesses and love life, Baker retained a strong sense of his own worth as a musician.\n\nAs well as mocking the Beatles, he described Mick Jagger as \u2018a bit of a girlie prat\u2019 and Elvis Presley as \u2018one of the biggest berks that ever lived\u2019. He retained his greatest derision for fellow drummers. He was furious when told that Rolling Stone magazine had rated him as history\u2019s third best drummer after John Bonham of Led Zeppelin and Keith Moon of The Who, and snorted that most of his rivals were nothing more than \u2018bashers\u2019.", "description": "London-born Ginger Baker was in 'supergroup' Cream alongside Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce.
