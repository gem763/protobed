If you will send me a request, yes, I will give you all official information, but it is not Ukrainian jurisdiction - that was my answer.\"\n\nPressed by our correspondent on any evidence Ukraine may have against the Bidens, Mr Lutsenko said: \"I can do nothing [on a case] which is not connected with Ukrainian law.\"\n\nWhat is the impeachment inquiry about?\n\nIn a complaint filed last month, a whistleblower from the intelligence community reported his \"urgent concern\" that the president had used his office to \"solicit interference from a foreign country\" in the 2020 US election.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry launched on Tuesday now focuses specifically on Mr Trump's call to the Ukrainian president about the discredited Biden allegations.\n\nDemocrats accuse Mr Trump of illegally seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden.\n\nMr Trump is also accused of using military aid for Ukraine as a bargaining tool.\n\nPresident Trump has dismissed the proceedings as a \"hoax\" and \"another witch-hunt\". On Saturday he accused leading Democrats of \"presidential harassment\" and branded them \"Democrat Savages\".", "description": "The ex-attorney general says Ukraine has no basis to investigate President Trump's rival Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pnd9f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
