Fists fly through the thick air and bodies are tossed around. A whistle pierces through the mayhem and everyone in the room stands at attention.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not the Metropolitan Police breaking up a rowdy, beer-fueled fracas in the middle of DC Brau. It\u2019s the Grammar Cop. A man adorned in a Party City-chic tactical suit issues a citation for incorrect verb tense usage to a man playing the role of high school gym teacher \u2014 and he responds by promptly hurling the officer over the top rope and into the metal barrier surrounding the pop-up ring on the warehouse floor.\n\nThe battle royal resumes as the brawlers whale on each other with punches and, occasionally, wrench each other\u2019s nipples.\n\nWelcome to Prime Time Pro Wrestling, the District\u2019s newest independent wrestling organization.\n\nThe wrestling promotion was founded earlier this year by Nick Capezza and Lolo McGrath, two fans who met at local indie wrestling shows. Capezza performs on the mic and works behind the scenes to handle booking wrestlers from across the country. McGrath was a bartender at Shaw\u2019s DC9 before they got into wrestling a few years ago on the recommendation of friends, and now handles the organization\u2019s branding efforts from Chicago.\n\nTogether, Capezza and McGrath have created an intimate spectacle that also reflects what makes Washington special to many: building a community that embraces the outsider status of wrestling and blends it with a mission of inclusion by highlighting queer wrestlers and having intergender matches.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of people from all kinds of different backgrounds [in D.C.] and walks of life, we need to create shows that feel super, super welcoming,\u201d McGrath says. \u201cWe want to show people this is what wrestling can be.\u201d\n\nPrime Time has found an audience; its first three shows at DC Brau, including this weekend\u2019s Embassy Row event (Sept. 28 at 3 p.m.), have sold out the 300-person-capacity brewery-turned-wrestling hub. It\u2019s also not the only indie wrestling organization that\u2019s taken over an unconventional venue in the area: CRAB Wrestling has staged events at Old Ox Brewery in Ashburn, for instance, and Flying V has set up shop at the Silver Spring Black Box Theatre.\n\nYes, this is all \u201cfake\u201d wrestling like World Wrestling Entertainment or All Elite Wrestling, which will debut its weekly TNT show \u201cDynamite\u201d at Capital One Arena on Oct. 2. It\u2019s fake in that the results are predetermined, but it\u2019s certainly real for the athletes who spend hours every weekend on the road hoping to impress onlookers with their ability to orchestrate or withstand an artistic beatdown.\n\nWe talked to five of Prime Time\u2019s marquee grapplers about what drives them to lace up their boots every weekend.\n\n[Upstart AEW is taking WWE head on -- with a focus on diversity and inclusion]\n\nBreaux Keller\n\nSometimes it\u2019s all in the name. Pronounce \u201cBreaux\u201d like the French would \u2014 \u201cbro\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s the origin story of the jockish nom de grapple Breaux Keller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an extension of myself,\u201d Kori Meshaw says. \u201cI know a lot of people say the best characters come from that \u2014 if you crank up your own personality to 11 or 12. Even still, when I work in my office, people were just like \u2018you\u2019re such a frat bro\u2019 and this and that, and as I was trying to think of where I wanted to go with my career, I went \u2018oh, I could use that, actually.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 190-pound Meshaw, the reigning champion of Prime Time, is essentially the physical prototype for a professional wrestler. The bubbly 29-year-old, who works as an account manager for a restaurant supplies company, was a track and field athlete through high school and college, and that clearly translates in the ring \u2014 the athleticism oozes as he springboards off the ropes or darts around the ring.\n\nMeshaw has been an on-again, off-again wrestling die-hard since childhood, when he would pester his older brother to let him watch the backstage dialogue of wrestling programs and not just the fighting parts. It\u2019s that connection to younger fans that makes Breaux Keller tick.\n\n\u201cThese people are paying to escape reality for however long it might be,\u201d Meshaw says. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to have fun and cut loose and if they have any sort of problems in the real world, they don\u2019t want that for however long it is they\u2019re in that venue. And I want to make sure I\u2019m playing my part in allowing that to happen and doing what I can to put a smile on their face.\u201d\n\nLady Frost and Savage Gentleman\n\nTraveling from town to town every weekend and ending up in the mishmash of makeshift wrestling rings that dot the East Coast can grind you down. But it makes life a lot easier when your significant other is walking you down the aisle.\n\nShane Chojnacki got his first action as a mixed martial arts fighter before gravitating away from cage fighting to professional wrestling. At his various shows, his then-girlfriend (now wife), Brittany Steding, tagged along for the ride \u2014 selling his merchandise to fans until she got bitten by the bug.\n\n\u201cI had never been around independent wrestling. I hadn\u2019t been to any televised [wrestling] shows since I was a little girl,\u201d Steding says. \u201cBut I had no idea about any of it and I definitely didn\u2019t think it was cool. It wasn\u2019t until that second or third match that I went to when a little girl came up to me with those big, beady eyes and asked me for my autograph. And I felt melted because it was just the sweetest thing ever and I was a nobody \u2014 literally, I was just a wrestler\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d\n\nEnter Pretty Proper, a coupling of the Savage Gentleman, a time-traveling steampunk brawler in search of his beloved, and Lady Frost, an ice queen ready to dress down her husband\u2019s opponents on the mic as his manager or primed to step in the ring and strike down foes with a heel kick.\n\nThe duo got their start in Pittsburgh and had similar paths as other independent wrestlers, balancing their day jobs (Chojnacki worked in a corrections facility and Steding owned a fitness company) with sacrificing their weekends pursuing their wrestling passion. However, once they got the call to train at Ring of Honor\u2019s dojo, they dropped everything and packed up their lives with their sights set on Charm City.\n\n\u201cAs far as sacrificing everything, I mean, we sold our house and moved our whole life to a new place with no guarantee of anything,\u201d Steding says.\n\n\u201cWe threw everything away for a chance because we believe in ourselves that much. We don\u2019t want to just be weekend warriors, we want this to be our careers, we want this to be our entire lives,\u201d Chojnacki says. \u201cWe\u2019re investing everything that we have into ourselves and into professional wrestling.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Shay Edwards\n\nWhen you talk to Justin Basnight \u2014 whose in-ring mannerisms consist of using the entirety of his 6-foot-3 frame to wreck the place with a snarl on his face as O\u2019Shay Edwards \u2014 the thing that strikes you the most is his expressiveness, delivered in a Southern drawl. Especially when you ask him what inspires his bulldozing monster of a persona who\u2019s also known as the Big Bad Kaiju.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Shay Edwards is a walking disaster film,\u201d Basnight says. \u201cIt\u2019s a walking superhero movie in terms of that final fight where these two guys are here to beat the absolute p--- out of one another, and they\u2019re going to destroy a whole city doing it. I am the walking embodiment of that. I am going to go through you, not because I can, but because I want to.\u201d\n\nBasnight, 35, is a late bloomer by wrestling standards. He started in his native Atlanta five years ago while working as a firefighter, but only began to see wrestling as a career opportunity after training with Robert Gibson, one half of the legendary wrestling tag team the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Express.\n\nSpurred on by his wife\u2019s encouragement, Basnight auditioned multiple times and nabbed an offer from Ring of Honor, an independent wrestling organization owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group and shown on its affiliate television stations, to move up to Baltimore and train at its \u201cdojo.\u201d The recognition could be a path to bigger things for Basnight, who works in repairs for insurance companies.\n\n\u201cMy life is a giant game of spin the plates,\u201d Basnight says. \u201c[My wife] wants to see me happy. She knows that wrestling is what makes me happy and so she\u2019s always my ride or die for that. Because she supports me so much, to me, it\u2019s my duty to make sure that I support her. That\u2019s why I do work the 40-hour-a -week job and I still find the time to do everything else I need to do, because she can support me in chasing this silly ass dream of mine.\u201d\n\nTrish Adora\n\nThe military fatigues that Trish Adora wears out to the ring isn\u2019t just a fashionable choice; it\u2019s a reminder of her life before she stepped into the squared circle. The Southeast D.C. native served in the Army for eight years and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 before she pursued her passion for professional wrestling.\n\n\u201cWhile I was [in the Army] I had these moments where I was faced with the decision where I was like, \u2018All right, either I\u2019m going to re-sign up and do this for the rest of my life, or I\u2019m going to try out wrestling and do that for the rest of my life,\u2019 \u201d Adora says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to me if I didn\u2019t at least explore what wrestling was.\u201d\n\nAnd once she takes off her jacket, Adora reveals more and more of what she represents: The makeup and colors of her ring garb signal her desire to be a strong representative of the African diaspora across the world.\n\nAdora, 30, grew up with five wrestling-obsessed brothers, and it was hard not to get caught up in a peak era for WWE. The wrestling giant has a long, complicated history with its treatment of its female athletes, and Adora only had a few names such as Chyna and Jacqueline to look up to. So, she hopes to be that role model for generations of wrestlers to come \u2014 thanks in no small part to the tutelage of former WWE wrestlers Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley, whose 3-D Academy trained Adora.\n\n[The women wrestlers of WWE have created a movement. Is it built to last?]\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not easy taking weekends off to travel the country in search of the next match \u2014 when not in the ring, Adora bartends at Navy Yard\u2019s Shilling Canning Company \u2014 but Adora jets around the world to show off her craft. While she won\u2019t be at the upcoming Prime Time event because of other bookings, nothing tops the thrill for Adora quite like the pop from D.C.\n\n\u201cI come out to the \u2018Circle of Life\u2019 intro then it cuts into a rap song and it\u2019s such a crazy feeling,\u201d Adora says. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy sometimes, I\u2019ll be so in the moment that I get back and can\u2019t even recall some of the moments that happen because your heart is beating so fast. [Getting to perform in your hometown] is a dope feeling, I think everyone should feel that at least once.\u201d\n\nPhotos by Marvin Joseph; Photo edit by Thomas Simonetti; Design by Joanne Lee", "description": "Prime Time Pro Wrestling is the District's newest independent wrestling organization.", "authors": ["Hau Chu"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JxnRdaAVNu_7S8-qspNRhIA1TBo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECNLSMW6MJC2DOXO2TPA4O42AU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
