MEPs retaliated by vetoing Sylvie Goulard, the French president\u2019s pick to join the new EU executive in Brussels.\n\nThe EPP is now expected to heap pressure on Mr Macron to name Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, as his choice to become what has been dubbed a \u201csuper-commissioner\u201d in charge of industrial, space and defence policy.\n\nThe French president rejected EPP candidate Manfred Weber in marathon talks in July that destroyed the 2014 Spitzenkandidat precedent, a democratic experiment that tied the commission presidency to the results of the European elections. Prior to 2014, EU leaders in the European Council picked the commission president.\n\nMr Macron was pivotal in the backroom summit dealings that led to Ursula von der Leyen being parachuted into the job. The switch humiliated the fragmented parliament which backed the replacement candidate by just nine votes, despite vowing not to in a resolution.\n\nEvery EU country nominates a commissioner to serve in Brussels but they face a hearing and vote from MEPs on their candidacy. Britain has not nominated a candidate for the next commission, which takes office on November 1, because of Brexit.", "description": "The European Parliament took revenge against Emmanuel Macron by rejecting his choice to be France\u2019s next EU Commissioner on Thursday.", "authors": ["James Crisp", "Brussels Correspondent", "Jemima Lewis", "David Green", "Matthew Lesh", "Stewart Jackson", "Vernon Bogdanor", "Michael Deacon", "Lucy Denyer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/25/TELEMMGLPICT000195199352-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
