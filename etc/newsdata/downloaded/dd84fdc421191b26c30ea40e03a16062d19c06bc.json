The birds quickly learn to ignore them.\n\n\"The effectiveness of laser controls are less understood.\n\n\"It is known that one local business has invested in this measure and steps will be taken to assess the impact this has had.\"", "description": "Town hall bosses have decided against a controversial cull of seagulls after being told it would be illegal - so are considering blasting them with lasers instead.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000213689730-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqT1LS2GR3SqHboNp8SH_ctdWv2RsTQzcP6v9Q8KMUz5Y.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
