These included \u201cwhether [Ukrainian officials] were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice\u201d related to the origins of the inquiry into Russian interference in 2016 election, which Mulvaney linked to an unfounded conspiracy theory which says Ukraine was involved in the theft of emails from Democratic servers.\n\nAsked if that was tantamount to a quid pro quo, Mulvaney said: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Fox News Sunday, Mulvaney claimed his words had been misreported, stating he had not acknowledged a quid pro quo.\n\nThat\u2019s what people are saying that I said, but I didn\u2019t say that Mick Mulvaney\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people are saying that I said, but I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he had clearly changed his line, now stating there were only \u201ctwo reasons\u201d aid was withheld: \u201crampant corruption in Ukraine\u201d and \u201cwhether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine\u201d.\n\nThe existence of a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine is at the centre of an impeachment inquiry led by Democrats in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe committees involved are also investigating Trump\u2019s request that the Ukrainain government commence an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The president made the request during a 25 July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nMulvaney has denied that the Biden request was tied to the decision to withhold aid.\n\nThe acting chief of staff is under the spotlight in the impeachment inquiry after testimony from a state department official, George Kent, placed him at the centre of efforts to create a separate diplomatic channel to Ukraine staffed by Trump loyalists including outgoing energy secretary Rick Perry and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocrats are weighing up whether to summon Mulvaney, according to reports.\n\nReports also emerged on Sunday that Mulvaney was facing ejection from his post before the impeachment inquiry began. CNN reported that Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and other advisers began screening for new candidates last month.\n\nMulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman, is the third White House chief of staff under Trump although he retains the \u201cacting\u201d prefix. He said on Sunday he had not considered tendering his resignation this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No.\u201d He said.\n\nThe Ukraine scandal is only one of a number in which the administration is currently embroiled.\n\nOn Saturday evening Trump was forced into an embarrassing climbdown, announcing his golf resort in Doral, Florida would no longer host the G7 summit next year following bi-partisan criticism of the decision.\n\nAt the end of the day he [Trump] still considers himself to be in the hospitality business Mick Mulvaney\n\nIn an attempt to defend the move, Mulvaney said: \u201cAt the end of the day he [Trump] still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\nThe administration is also reeling from bipartisan criticism of its decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria.\n\nOn Sunday, secretary of state Mike Pompeo sought to defend a fragile and brief ceasefire brokered with Turkey, which he described as \u201cthe outcome that President Trump sent us to achieve\u201d.\n\nThe US and Turkey reached an agreement on Thursday to halt Turkish operations against Kurdish forces for five days to allow military and civilians to evacuate an area of land around the border about 20 miles deep, before the territory is claimed by Turkey.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An American soldier mounts the US flag on a vehicle near the town of Tel Tamr in northern Syria.

Republicans and Democrats in Washington argue the deal has undermined US interests in the region and delivered a significant victory to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nAmericans want an end to forever wars. But that's not what Trump offers | Joshua Leifer Read more\n\nPompeo, also at the centre of the Ukraine scandal, distanced himself from such criticisms during an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, when asked if the Turkish government had been handed everything it had asked for.\n\n\u201cI was there. It sure didn\u2019t feel that way when we were negotiating,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIt was a hard-fought negotiation. It began before the vice-president and I even arrived in Ankara.\u201d\n\nTrump chimed in on Twitter, quoting his defense secretary on how \u201cthe ceasefire is holding up very nicely\u201d. In his first version of the tweet, the president typed Mark Esper\u2019s name as Mark Esperanto.\n\nOver the weekend, Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi led a bipartisan delegation to Jordan to discuss the fallout of Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal.\n\n\u201cOur bipartisan delegation is visiting Jordan at a critical time for the security and stability of the region,\u201d Pelosi\u2019s office said in a statement released on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to Isis, Iran and Russia.\u201d\n\nDespite the chaos over US Syria policy, one of Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters in the Senate seemed to have abandoned his previously stringent criticism.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Lindsey Graham said he was \u201cincreasingly optimistic that we can have some historic solutions in Syria that have eluded us for years if we play our cards right\u201d.", "description": "Chief of staff defends Doral G7 fiasco and his own Ukraine quid pro quo remarks, insisting his job is not in danger", "authors": ["Oliver Laughland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da90a43c451104c0c05765e5f756a4b7126b2ac9/0_176_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5932bc484fca49293ecfc858479e6ca4", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
