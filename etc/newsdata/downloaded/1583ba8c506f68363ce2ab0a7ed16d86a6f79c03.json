The conventional wisdom that dominates Washington and is reflexively referenced in the impeachment inquiry chatter holds that this aid is crucial to U.S. national security. But that just isn\u2019t true.\n\nThere are many compelling reasons to stop sending taxpayer dollars and military aid to Kiev. While this assistance certainly won\u2019t be the centerpiece of the upcoming hearings and investigations, hopefully Americans will become more aware of the pitfalls of aid to Ukraine and begin to challenge U.S. officials over the issue.\n\nThe $391 million in U.S. military aid that was recently released to the Ukrainian government\u2014and is now at the center of the current political controversy\u2014is the latest of nearly $1.5 billion of U.S. taxpayer dollars that have gone to Kiev since the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOverall U.S. assistance, which nearly doubled between 2013 and 2016 to more than half a billion dollars annually, is aimed at building resilience in the Ukrainian government against external Russian destabilization, and against internal threats of corruption and anti-democratic activity. It funds everything from developmental aid to anti-tank missiles and Humvees.\n\nUkraine has minimal connection to U.S. security and prosperity. We won the Cold War with Ukraine being part of the Soviet Union\u2019s Warsaw Pact, and Russia today does not pose anything close to the same threat to America the Soviet Union did. Willis L Krumholz Researcher\n\nBut there are serious concerns about whether U.S. monies actually enable more corruption in Ukraine and further enrich bureaucrats and oligarchs. And the efficacy of U.S. aid, military or otherwise, that reaches the intended recipient is still questionable; we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the world how American largess is hard-pressed to create Jeffersonian democracies in areas without a strong democratic tradition. Even more important, U.S. aid to Ukraine\u2014especially of the military variety\u2014comes with real costs and risks to America.\n\nThat\u2019s because Ukraine has minimal connection to U.S. security and prosperity. We won the Cold War with Ukraine being part of the Soviet Union\u2019s Warsaw Pact, and Russia today does not pose anything close to the same threat to America the Soviet Union did. Similarly, for all his ambition, Russian President Vladimir Putin is not Joseph Stalin.\n\nBut even in this age of globalization, geography matters\u2014a lot. Because Russia and Ukraine share a 1,200-mile border, Ukraine is far more important to Moscow than it ever will be to U.S. security. And despite their conflict, Russia is still Ukraine\u2019s largest trading partner. That means Russia has \u201cescalation dominance\u201d: The U.S. arming Ukraine will almost always result in a Russian response that is even stronger. Therefore, rather than end the conflict or reduce violence for Ukrainians, military aid risks prolonging it.\n\nIn this light, Putin\u2019s nationalism can be understood as a terrified reaction to NATO expansion. Like the tsars of old, or the Soviets, he seeks a buffer from a vastly more prosperous and powerful West. U.S. involvement in Ukrainian security is thus perceived as a near-existential threat, just as we would perceive great danger in Russian or Chinese meddling in Canada or Mexico.\n\nGiven the distance, even strong supporters of continuing aid to Ukraine generally acknowledge U.S. strategic interests there are limited or at least indirect. The defined U.S. interests, as stated in legislation, amount to vague proclamations about fostering democracy, world order and protecting the territorial integrity of countries on the other side of the world, with little to no direct connection to U.S. security or prosperity.\n\nMany say Ukraine aid is necessary to counter Russia, but in conventional military power, meaning the threat of Russian airpower, tanks and soldiers, Russia is no match for the United States. The Russian defense budget is only about $65 billion, while America\u2019s is $700 billion. Russia\u2019s economy is far smaller than ours as well\u2014it\u2019s essentially Italy with nukes. That makes Russia a regional power at best; while Putin is a thug, he has no chance to rebuild the Soviet empire even if that were his goal.\n\nOnly in nuclear war would Russia pose an existential threat to the United States, as Russia holds the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenal. In fact, the U.S. and Russia combined hold 90 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons.\n\nThe chance of nuclear war between the two countries is incredibly small, but American policymakers should try to avoid actions that marginally increase the chance of open war with Russia\u2014where policymakers lose control and both countries careen to the brink of nuclear confrontation\u2014rather than foster them, as feeding the conflict in Ukraine does.\n\nWe also risk hurting our own credibility by involving ourselves in a conflict in which we have little skin in the game. If Washington continues to escalate, Moscow will call its bluff\u2014and Washington is bluffing, because Russia is much more likely to accept the costs of increased escalation.\n\nTo those who ask whether Ukraine desperately needs America\u2019s military help, the answer is not really. Right now, the government in Kiev is in a stalemate with Ukraine\u2019s Russia-backed breakaway eastern regions, populated by ethnic Russians. American weapons won\u2019t change this stalemate, which is based on geography and a broader ethnic divide.\n\nUkraine actually exports anti-tank munitions, along with a host of other weapons. There\u2019s a risk that the U.S. javelin missiles Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskiy sought in his infamous July phone call with Trump are valued by the Ukranians mostly because this means the U.S. has a stake in the conflict, rather than because of their efficacy on the battlefield.\n\nAmerica should be tough with Russia when U.S. security and prosperity are at stake but realize that cooperation and a balance of power is required for lasting peace. Willis L Krumholz Researcher\n\nFundamentally, Kiev seeks a de-facto security guarantee from American servicemembers and taxpayers. Problem is, this security guarantee risks the dangerous escalation between Washington and Moscow mentioned above, especially when the country provided the guarantee is as corrupt and dysfunctional as is Ukraine.\n\nInstead of military aid, the solution is for America to take a backseat and allow its partners in Europe to help Ukraine in its shift to democracy. Europe has much more cordial relations with Russia than does America, and Europe also has a bigger stake in Ukraine than does the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, America should be tough with Russia when U.S. security and prosperity are at stake but realize that cooperation and a balance of power is required for lasting peace. Giving weapons to a volatile and potentially corrupt government in Kiev is shortsighted.\n\nAlong with the constitutional questions Congress and the public are raising, continuing U.S. military aid to Ukraine should not be ignored. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-cost arrangement that could backfire on America.\n\nWillis L Krumholz is a fellow at Defense Priorities.
