Prices have fallen below the declining 50-day moving average line and also the still rising 200-day line. The 50-day average is close to breaking below the 200-day line for what is commonly called a (bearish) dead cross.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line peaked in February and has been on a downtrend since and tells us that sellers of SAGE have been more aggressive.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bearish configuration below the zero line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of SAGE, below, we can see what looks like a large double top formation. Prices are below the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been stalled in recent months while the MACD oscillator is close to moving below the zero line for a sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SAGE, below, we can see a downside price projection of $122.\n\nBottom line strategy: Remain defensive and let SAGE fall. The Point and Figure target of $122 may not stop the decline as there is no particular pocket of chart support in that area. We'll get interested in the long side when the chart begins to find support.", "description": "Let's check and see if the charts and indicators suggest where prices might bottom out....SAGE", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Sage Therapeutics Is Pointed Down So We Are In No Rush To Buy", "Let'S Check", "See If The Charts", "Indicators Suggest Where Prices Might Bottom Out.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Jim Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1bcbcbb7-6442-11e8-9389-9f414d75b9ba.png"}
