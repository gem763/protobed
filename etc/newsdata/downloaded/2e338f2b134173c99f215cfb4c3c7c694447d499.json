I am not happy to have hurt you. Some have lost a good friend. Others, a good family member, and I am ashamed to have caused it,' Cano said, according to media reports.\n\nCano's lawyers said he had trouble controlling his emotions and was diagnosed with autism after his arrest.\n\nThey had sought to have him found mentally incompetent to stand trial.\n\nA contractor who entered the property to carry out repair work first discovered Cano, left, hiding in a crawlspace under the house with blood dripping through the floorboards above him\n\nMiguel Cano, 17, is pictured entering the courtroom for his sentencing on Monday\n\nCano, right, said he had planned to kill his mother, left, and others too\n\nZuluaga's body was found by a contractor who came to the house to work.\n\nWhen he didn't get an answer at the door, the contractor went under the house and found Cano sitting there and blood dripping down from the floor.\n\nCano said he killed his mother the night before. Bloody paper towels were found around her body.\n\nA judge ruled last year that Cano could be tried as an adult on a murder charge, which carried a possible sentence of 30 years to life in prison.\n\nProsecutors accepted a plea deal to voluntary manslaughter, which carried two to 30 years behind bars.\n\nIf Cano had been tried and convicted as a juvenile, he couldn't have been kept in prison after he turned 21.\n\nCano, who was aged 13 at the time of the incident, allegedly used a large knife to kill his mother (pictured) right before bedtime. The coroner said Zuluaga suffered multiple stab wounds to her torso\n\nJudge Letitia Verdin sentenced Miguel Cano, 17, to 23 years in the South Carolina Department of Corrections for stabbing his mother, 44-year-old Isabel Zuluaga 28 times when he was 13\n\nPublic Defender Christopher Scalzo asked for a 13-year sentence because of Cano's age and autism.\n\nFamily members and friends also testified Monday, saying Cano was smart and liked to play soccer, but also seemed to enjoy violence and had talked about murder.\n\nCano read his apology in court in a clear, calm voice.\n\n'I'll continue to try my best to be a better person, not just during my incarceration, but as long as I live,' Cano said.", "description": "Miguel Cano was 13 years old when he was accused of stabbing his mother 28 times, killing her at their South Carolina home.
