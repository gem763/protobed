Brown spoke to SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow in a Wednesday interview for the show\u2019s weekly TPUSA campus report.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of what [the school] deems bias-related incidents on our campus recently,\u201d said Brown, who mentioned that some students \u2014 who had no affiliation with TPUSA \u2014 had posted photos in \u201cblackface\u201d makeup, and that in a separate incident, an anonymous vandal had drawn a swastika on a building.\n\n\u201cAnd somehow,\u201d continued Brown, \u201cTurning Point USA has been conflated with those things, which is completely untrue and unfounded. None of our students were involved in any of those things.\u201d\n\nOne reason for the wrongful conflation was likely due to the university\u2019s president, Joyce McConnell, who bizarrely sent an email to the entire CSU student body in which she compared Kirk and his organization to \u201cblackface\u201d and a swastika.\n\nSubsequently, students had become outraged Brown\u2019s event featuring Kirk, Trump Jr., and Guilfoyle as speakers on Tuesday.\n\nListen below:\n\n\u201cWe came out and said that those things were horrible, and we have nothing to do with that,\u201d said Brown, \u201cbut because we\u2019re a conservative organization on campus, a lot of people are just willing to loop us in with any of the horrible things that happen on campus, because they want to silence us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Charlie Kirk got on stage last night, he made it clear that Turning Point USA is not involved in those things, and we do not stand for racism,\u201d continued Brown, adding that students had nonetheless arrived before the event to protest.\n\n\u201cThere were petitions signed by students, trying to get us kicked off campus for creating \u2018unsafe spaces,'\u201d said Brown, \u201cand there were many groups who began to really target us for exercising our right of free speech and bringing speakers, who, otherwise students would never hear their viewpoints on this campus.\u201d\n\nBrown added that while some of the protests were silent, others were not, as individuals clad in all black began chanting \u201chey hey, ho ho, Turning Point has got to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was some communication sent out by the university, which directly conflated us with those bias-related incidents,\u201d added Brown, in reference to the email sent by the university president last month.\n\n\u201cIt absolutely is exhausting to deal with the lunacy of the tactics that are used on campus,\u201d said Brown, \u201cbut without a group like Turning Point USA on campus, it wouldn\u2019t really be as possible as it is today, so we\u2019re grateful to have Turning Point on our campus.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Turning Point USA spokesperson, the university\u2019s president has since apologized privately to Brown for potentially putting innocent students in harm\u2019s way.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Colorado State University (CSU) student and Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter president Gabby Brown told Breitbart News that leftists had tried to get her group's event\u00a0featuring TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump Jr., and Kimberly Guilfoyle banned for \"creating unsafe spaces\" on campus.
