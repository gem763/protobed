And wait for it to be over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad this year because when they did the first drill, they already knew,\u201d she said. \u201cThey already knew that they were supposed to be silent.\u201d\n\nCisneros' fears are grounded in a sad reality.\n\nIn a 28-day span in August, mass shooters in El Paso and Odessa cemented Texas' status as the state with the most mass shooting deaths dating back to when a former Marine gunned down 14 people from a sniper's nest in the University of Texas tower on Aug. 1, 1966.\n\nIn recent years, mass shooters have ended 69 innocent lives in Odessa, El Paso, Sutherland Springs, Santa Fe and Dallas. Three of the shooters also were killed.\n\nAs to what defines a mass shooting, in a 2015 study, the Congressional Research Service said FBI criminal profilers use \u201cmass murder\u201d for incidents in which \u201cfour or more victims are murdered \u2014 not including (the offenders) \u2014 within one event, and in one or more geographical locations relatively near one another.\u201d The report used \u201cmass shooting\u201d for such cases in which firearms were used.\n\nThis report excludes mass shootings where domestic violence was the only motivation and shootouts between civilians.\n\nAnd mass shootings are impacting Texas life in profound ways.\n\nIt\u2019s changing how Texans care for their children, protect their classrooms, practice their faith, police their neighborhoods and equip their ambulances and emergency rooms. Mass shooters also color how ordinary citizens look at their personal safety. The killers have devastated generations of Texas families.\n\nMourners visit a makeshift memorial outside Santa Fe High School after a 2018 mass shooting that left 10 dead. Courtney Sacco/Caller-Times-USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nHouston police Chief Art Acevedo recalled the bloodshed, fear, anger and sadness he encountered when he stepped onto the grounds of Santa Fe High School on May 18, 2018.\n\nEight students and two teachers lay dead from gunfire; 13 others were wounded.\n\nAcevedo had seen the effects of shootouts by armed gangs and random violence during a 30-year career that has taken him from California to Austin to Houston.\n\n\u201cI had never been at a mass shooting at a school and witnessed firsthand the angst that incident has on a community,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cYou see it on first responders' faces, on the staff, on the faculty, the administration.\u201d\n\nWith each mass shooting, Texans grieve.\n\nAs a parent, Butch Pool\u2019s heart sinks a little deeper.\n\nPool can't find the words to talk with his 9-year-old son about why someone would want to kill so many people, including children.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the inner debate,\u201d said Pool, who lives in Corpus Christi and owns a seafood company. \u201cDo you put that kind of fear in them versus safety in an event that\u2019s probably extremely unlikely to happen?\u201d\n\nPool thinks the focus in Texas should be not just on increasing security but on enforcing gun laws, universal background checks and addressing mental illness to curb mass shootings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re on defense versus on offense,\u201d Pool said.\n\nRemembering mass shooting victims in Texas Sarah A Due\u00f1as, El Paso Times\n\nMass shootings are 'a public health crisis'\n\nDr. Lillian Liao is part of a club she never wanted to join. Recalling the horrific initiation two years ago still brings her to tears. And, she said, it probably always will.\n\nSurgeon Dr. Lillian Liao provided care when nine people, including three children, were rushed to the emergency room after a mass shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. Rachel Denny Clow/Caller-Times\n\nLiao, a pediatric trauma surgeon at University Hospital in San Antonio, provided emergency care Nov. 5, 2017, when nine people bleeding from the wounds inflicted by a mass shooter's rifle at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs were rushed to University\u2019s emergency room 45 miles away.\n\nThree of the wounded were children. Liao had to pronounce a girl dead after she and her team couldn't save her. Emily Garcia was 7.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, pausing to collect her emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s been a couple of years.\u201d\n\nLater, she added, \u201cI\u2019m probably going to cry about it 10 years from now.\u201d\n\nAlthough she treats far more patients injured in car crashes, Liao said mass shootings fall into a category of their own. The American College of Surgeons, she said, calls the bloodshed inflicted by mass shooters nationwide \"a public health crisis.\u201d\n\nThe horrific aftermath of mass shootings has led to a support system in Texas' and America\u2019s trauma units.\n\nAfter the Aug. 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, where 22 people were killed and 25 were injured, University Medical Center of El Paso received banners of support from other hospital staffs.\n\nA wall of the hospital\u2019s cafeteria was decorated with banners from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the hospital that cared for victims of two Colorado mass shootings, and from Orlando Regional Medical Center, which cared for survivors of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida.\n\n\u201cThe senselessness of the entire situation across the country is tragic,\u201d Liao said.\n\nAfter the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso on Aug. 3, University Medical Center of El Paso received banners of support from other U.S. hospitals in communities targeted by mass shooters. Tim Archuleta/El Paso Times\n\nBut Liao and others in the American College of Surgeons are doing more than simply wringing their hands.\n\nThey are focusing on how they can save lives moving forward. First, Liao said, is \u201cprimary prevention.\u201d This includes broad, long-term concerns such as firearm safety, health care research and mental health counseling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a one-sided discussion on firearms,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also about mental health. It is also about supporting the community. There are multiple things that we need to do as a society to prevent (mass shootings) from happening.\u201d\n\nFor secondary prevention, Liao said, more whole blood units have been placed in EMS vehicles \u2014 both ambulances and air carriers around a 54,000-square-mile radius in South Texas.\n\n\u201cWhen people die, they die of hemorrhage,\u201d she said. \"And if we can slow down this hemorrhage, then we can buy them time to get to the hospital alive.\u201d\n\nAnd they advocate for more \u201cStop the Bleed\u201d training classes. The classes are part of a Texas and nationwide campaign to teach bystanders how to act quickly to stop rapid blood loss due to an injury.\n\n\u201cSomeone can bleed to death in as little as five minutes,\u201d Liao said. \u201cWe have a \u2018Stop the Bleed\u2019 class pretty much every day now. Our group has gone back to Sutherland Springs to teach the church \u2018Stop the Bleed.\u2019 It helps us because we feel like we\u2019re doing something to prevent maybe a death the next time.\u201d\n\nAs the nurse supervisor at Odessa Regional Medical Center, Mariza Levario knows her first responsibility is to protect her patients.\n\nThe gunman who terrified the Midland-Odessa area in the Aug. 31 killing spree that would leave seven dead and more than two dozen injured still was on the loose when Levario set in motion plans to lock down the hospital.\n\nOnly after the doors were firmly secured did Levario feel the shock and fear welling up inside her.\n\n\u201cI thought, 'Oh my God, it\u2019s here,' \" the 10-year Navy veteran said.\n\nDr. Rohith Saravanan had only been chief medical officer at Odessa Regional for three months when the shooting took place. He was visiting family in Austin that Saturday but immediately went to work directing the emergency response remotely.\n\nDr. Rohith Saravanan, chief medical officer at Odessa Regional A lot of hospitals who have gone through things like this before \u2014 they\u2019ve changed over time. They\u2019re more prepared. For us? We have to prepare more.\"\n\n\u201cIt was a hard call to take,\u201d Saravanan said. \u201cThe first process was doing the lockdown. Because it was the holiday weekend, it made that very hard. We did have an administrator in town, but the majority of our administrative team was out of town visiting family.\u201d\n\nThe shooting took place on Labor Day weekend.\n\nSix people arrived at Odessa Regional with injuries related to the mass shooting; four eventually were sent home, while two were admitted to the hospital \u2014 one in critical condition.\n\nAs the number of mass shootings around the country began to climb, Saravanan said he noticed a change in the way hospitals trained staff.\n\n\u201cA lot of hospitals who have gone through things like this before \u2014 they\u2019ve changed over time. They\u2019re more prepared. For us? We have to prepare more. We have to drill more.

Tensions were high at the school for grades kindergarten through eighth.\n\nIt wasn't a drill. A man with a BB gun was arrested nearby after windows on a home were broken. A spokesperson for the school district said there was a suspected home invasion nearby and the school was placed on lock down, but they were soon given the all clear.\n\nJohn Humphreys, Eastwood Knolls' band director, started yelling as loud as he could for people to get inside. Students were on their way out of the building and parents were picking them up. He gathered the kids, their parents and other teachers.\n\nMany of the children trembled and cried, Humphreys said.\n\n\u201cI think students realized this might have been a real deal,\u201d said Humphreys, who has been at Eastwood Knolls for 11 years. During the lockdown, he added, students were quiet and comforting each other until the all-clear was given.\n\nMass shooters have turned schools into security zones. Security cameras are commonplace on many campuses, and sophisticated security features often are incorporated into the architecture of new school buildings.\n\nDavid Walker, superintendent of Christoval Independent School District Every time we don't learn something from these incidents, like what happened in El Paso or Odessa, it means children died in vain.\"\n\nSome campuses have security protocols so strict parents are not allowed to walk their children to class.\n\nOn public college campuses, students who are 21 and older with a license to carry can bring their handguns to lecture halls and dorms.\n\nIn the tightly knit West Texas community of Christoval, school Superintendent David Walker said lockdown drills and high-tech security features alone won't protect his district's 550 students and 81 employees.\n\nChristoval, about 20 miles from San Angelo, the nearest city and hospital, was the second school district in Texas to allow armed staff members after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut that killed 26.\n\nSearchable database: See which Texas school district allow armed staff\n\n\u201cWe were the first district to have long guns and the first to have emergency trauma equipment,\u201d Walker said.\n\nThe community's two campuses have emergency trauma kits and multi-casualty bags designed for active shooter situations. Employees have access to tourniquets, compression gauze, chest decompression needles, emergency tracheotomy kits and more.\n\n\u201cWe have emergency kits in every classroom, in every vehicle, and in every office that can treat multiple people,\u201d Walker said.\n\n\"Every time we don't learn something from these incidents, like what happened in El Paso or Odessa, it means children died in vain,\" he said. \"And shame on us for not doing something about it.

And, in some cases, it has changed the lives and careers of officers, who often are targets.\n\nIn the Odessa shooting, three officers from three different agencies were wounded before the gunman was killed outside a movie theater. All three survived the attack by a man with a history of threatening to kill officers.\n\nMass shooters in Texas aren't swayed by the state\u2019s reputation as being tough on crime.\n\n\"It's forced us to evolve our training. It's forced us to evolve our mindset,\" said Acevedo, the Houston police chief.\n\nIn an active shooting, waiting for backup often isn\u2019t an option.\n\n\"When you know people are dying, when there's gunfire, you run towards it and engage the subject,\u201d Acevedo said.\n\nThat change in mindset takes a toll.\n\n\"Our officers are much more at risk,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cThey end up suffering from post-traumatic stress injuries. I don't call them 'disorders' because it's not like they did something wrong. It's an injury caused by the trauma of having to see people suffering.\n\n\"It impacts their psyche,\u201d he said. \u201cIt impacts their emotions.\"\n\nSenior Cpl. Terrance Hopkins of the Dallas Police Department was a tactical planner assigned to the downtown command post in July 2016 during a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest.\n\nThe peace was shattered when an Army reservist armed with an AK-47-style rifle and a semiautomatic handgun opened fire. Before the gunman was killed by an explosives-carrying police robot, five officers were shot to death. Nine other officers were hit by gunfire and two civilians were wounded.\n\nThe attack is a tragic reminder law enforcement can never let its guard down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re there for a visual presence/deterrent,\" said Hopkins, a 29-year law enforcement veteran and president of the Black Police Association of Greater Dallas. \"But you cannot get lackadaisical, thinking that just because you\u2019re there, it won\u2019t happen.\"\n\nGun owner: 'I just want to prepare myself for the worst'\n\nDana McConnell grew up in a gun-owning household with a father who instilled in him an abiding respect for a firearm's power. He shot his first gun - a rifle - when he was 10 years old outside his uncle's house in Bastrop County.\n\n\u201cMy dad every Sunday would take out his revolver and clean it and talk to us about it,\u201d said McConnell, an Austin Realtor. \u201cIt was never \u2018I\u2019m going to pick it up and go shoot anybody.\u2019 It was a thing of respect and honor and safety, always. These days, it just doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s there anymore.\u201d\n\nOn a Saturday in September with the mass shootings in El Paso and Odessa still in the headlines, McConnell helped organize a group of six other real estate professionals to take the class needed to qualify for a license to carry.\n\nMichael Cargill, instructor with Central Texas Gun Works in Austin Once you pull out that gun and use it, your life is going to change.\"\n\nSome in the group, which totaled about 40, believed if they were armed, they'd be able to stand up to a shooter.

She was taking the class but admitted guns scare her.\n\n\u201cMy husband has always believed we should have a gun in the house,\u201d Ellis said. \"And I\u2019m terrified of it.\"\n\nShe choked up at the prospect of shooting at someone, even in self-defense.\n\n\u201cThis is all very stressful,\u201d she said, fighting tears.\n\nWhen it was her turn to shoot, Ellis was hesitant. James, her husband of almost 20 years, tried to break the tension with humor.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get a margarita unless you go,\u201d he said.\n\nLater, she stepped up to the firing line, clutched her .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol with both hands and aimed at the blue, humanlike silhouette.\n\nShe hit the target and passed the class, but isn't going to go through with getting her license to carry.\n\n\"I've realized that I don't think the answer is arming more people with more guns,\" she said.\n\nThe good guy with a gun\n\nStephen Willeford put a face to the mantra long invoked by gun rights activists: \"Only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun.\"\n\nWilleford, 57, is the Sutherland Springs plumber who ran barefoot carrying an AR-15 from his house across the street from the First Baptist Church when he heard gunfire.\n\nStephen Willeford is hailed as a hero for helping to bring down the shooter who killed 25 people at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Courtney Sacco/Caller-Times\n\nYelling a simple \"Hey!\" Willeford drew the gunman's fire. The gunman missed, but Willeford did not. He fired one round into the man's side, between the plates of body armor protecting his torso and back.\n\nA second round hit high on the man's leg. When the killer clambered into his vehicle to speed from the church, Willeford fired once more, shattering the vehicle's rear window.\n\nThe gunman ultimately killed himself on a remote Texas roadway.\n\nWilleford's story has been told and retold.

He rushed to Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, where many of the wounded were taken.\n\nHe wasn't prepared for what he saw. He said he drew strength not only from God, but from the doctors and nurses working to save lives.\n\nPastor Mike Clements of First Baptist Church was among the first clergy leaders to arrive in Sutherland Springs after the 2017 mass shooting that took the lives of 25 plus an unborn child. Courtney Sacco/Caller-Times\n\n\u201cI said I've got to do the same thing. I can't break down,\u201d the pastor of 20 years said. \"I've got to be strong so I can try to comfort them, pray with them, try to answer their questions.\"\n\nFor Clements, 61, it was the beginning of a long and blurry week where he\u2019d help officiate several funerals, including one for a family that lost three generations and nine relatives to gunfire in a house of worship.\n\nToday, it is legal to carry a concealed weapon into a Texas church.\n\nAfter Sutherland Springs, Clements knew he had to protect his church in the town of 6,500. Some of his fellow rural pastors, he said, opted to have a conspicuous police presence for Sunday services. He opted for a lower-key response.\n\nHe now has \"a security team\": Greeters in the parking lot welcome worshipers to Sunday services. Also, people at each service discreetly watch for anything out of the ordinary, he said. \u201cWe didn't have that before.\u201d\n\nAnd some people in his church come to worship armed.\n\n\u201cI'm fine with it,\" he said.\n\nMost major religions in Texas leave the decision on allowing guns to church leaders at the local level.\n\nPastor Frank Pomeroy of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs often carries his holstered pistol on his hip at church.

Greg Abbott has led his state in grief through more deaths by mass shooters in his home state than any other American governor.\n\nSeven months before the first deadly mass shooting on his watch, Abbott posted a tweet about Texas slipping into second place among the states in total gun sales.\n\n\"I'm EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA,\" he said in the social posting during the lunch hour of Oct. 28, 2015. \"Let's pick up the pace Texans.\"\n\nGreg Abbott has been governor of Texas since 2015 and seen five mass shootings. Courtney Sacco/Caller-Times\n\nAt the time he posted it, Abbott\u2019s tweet seemed to make perfect political sense for a Texas governor.\n\nGuns have been woven into the fabric of Texas since taming of the frontier. Guns put food on the pioneers' tables, conquered the Comanches and defended the Alamo.\n\nMonths earlier, he was elected by a landslide on a platform that included a stout defense of the Second Amendment. Like-minded Republicans controlled both houses of the Legislature and all statewide judgeships.\n\nBut nearly a year into his second term, mass shootings have come to define Abbott's tenure. Within hours after the shootings, Abbott rearranged his schedule to travel to each city and meet with local elected officials and law enforcement.\n\nHe made phone calls to apprise then-President Barack Obama after the July 2016 shootings in Dallas of the situation on the ground. In the shootings since, he made the same calls to President Donald Trump.\n\nStarting at dawn the Monday after the Sutherland Springs shooting, the governor appeared on nearly all network and cable news outlets to share his state's shock and grief with the nation. Later in the week, he accompanied Vice President Mike Pence to the community's memorial service.\n\nLater, he would accompany Trump as he met with survivors in El Paso.\n\nAfter Santa Fe and again after El Paso, Abbott convened roundtable discussions with experts and survivors but consensus on how to prevent or even reduce the likelihood of future shootings remains elusive.\n\nAbbott has issued a list of executive orders aimed largely at bolstering the law enforcement response when signs indicate people who might pose a public threat are reported to authorities.\n\nThe orders, which seek to close gaps in law enforcement procedures, do not make specific recommendations to further limit access to weapons.\n\nAfter several verbal requests, the USA TODAY Network has made a written request for an interview with Abbott to discuss how the spate of mass shootings on his watch has elevated his job to include being the state\u2019s consoler-in-chief and what specific recommendations he plans to present to the Legislature to minimize the chances of future mass shootings in Texas.\n\nSpokesman John Wittman said Abbott\u2019s schedule has been full in recent weeks, including a weeklong visit to South Korea to explore trade initiatives. Abbott has not ruled out an interview, Wittman said, but could not commit to a specific time.\n\nThe spokesman did acknowledge that the number of shootings and the number of dead and wounded have had a profound effect on Abbott and changed the public's expectations on how a Texas governor must respond to tragedy.\n\n\u201cGovernor Abbott was elected to lead in times of triumph and times of crisis,\" Wittman said. \"When tragedy strikes Texas, the governor responds to the needs of victims and communities.\"\n\nAt the community prayer vigil for Sutherland Springs he attended with Pence just days after the shootings, Abbott said he had just met with Kris Workman, whose gunshot wounds to his back inflicted the same damage to his spine that left Abbott paralyzed when a tree fell on him when he was 26.\n\n\"I told Kris' mom I was proud to meet another future governor of the state of Texas,\" Abbott said at the vigil.\n\nWittman said the governor's personal history colors his response when he must console Texans statewide or in one-on-one settings.\n\n\"He draws upon his own tragedy that left him in a wheelchair at an early age to help comfort and console during difficult times,\" Wittman said. \"The governor understands the need for compassion, but also the need for urgency and action in order to prevent future tragedies from taking place.\"\n\nHonoring shooting victims: Gov. Greg Abbott speaks at the Sutherland Springs vigil\n\nAnd there is evidence Texas' storied affinity for guns is evolving.\n\nBrandon Rottinghaus, political science professor at the University of Houston Part of a governor's legacy is whether they find a way to put aside partisan politics at times of crisis. The question is, has Governor Abbott done that successfully?\"\n\nInstead of tools for self-protection and survival, many modern Texans look at them simply as items to be feared, said longtime Austin political consultant Bill Miller.\n\n\"The people that own guns, and I damn sure own them, don't want to give them up,\" he said. \"But those who don't owns guns, don't shoot guns and never have, they're afraid.\"\n\nIt's probably too soon to tell how the mass shootings on Abbott's watch will shape his legacy over the long haul, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. Much depends on his ability to craft measures that deal with mass violence without regard for the political fallout, he said.\n\n\"Part of a governor's legacy is whether they find a way to put aside partisan politics at times of crisis,\" Rottinghaus said. \"The question is, has Governor Abbott done that successfully?\"\n\nWhile lawmakers struggle to balance gun rights with actions to curb mass shootings, Texans are going about their lives \u2014 many preparing for the next time.\n\nFrom carrying a weapon in the hope of stopping a mass shooter to learning how to treat gunshot wounds, everyday Texans are the new first responders.\n\nBill Vallie will be there to care for the victims of the next mass shooting and their grieving families.\n\nAs regional manager of the Legacy Funeral Group, he's provided comfort after mass shootings and sees the funeral business as the \"hidden first responders.\"\n\nFuneral homes offer comfort to wounded communities. They play a key role in the grieving process, sometimes offering their services for free, as was done in El Paso.\n\n\"We come in and take care of all the victims,\" Vallie said.\n\nReporting by: John C Moritz and Eleanor Dearman, Austin Bureau USA TODAY NETWORK; John Tufts in San Angelo, Vicky Camarillo in Corpus Christi, and Trish Choate in Wichita Falls.", "description": "Mass shootings are changing the ways Texans care for their children, practice their faith and police their neighborhoods.", "authors": ["Usa Today Network-Texas", "El Paso Times"], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/10/PTX1/0a3282bc-20f9-4136-8cd8-d54520040e7e-Walmart_Memorial.JPG?crop=2699,1519,x0,y0&width=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
