And the fell to 3.5%.\n\nStock index futures rose after the report on relief after a week of miserable economic indicators, as much as anything else.\n\nThe report is \u201cnot weak enough to support the hypothesis of rapidly spreading economy-wide weakness ... but also not confirming that the domestic sector is immune from global pressure,\u201d Allianz (DE: ) Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.\n\nThe one outlier was wage growth, which was flat for last month.
