It could also help to encourage users to spend more time on Instagram without moving elsewhere to message friends. In the past, data showed that Snapchat did a better job of this.\n\nThe news of the Threads app comes just months after Facebook alerted users that another of its standalone messaging apps, Direct, is coming to a grinding halt just two years after it launched. The app, called Direct, was rolled out in 2017 in Chile, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Uruguay but it never really took off.\n\nIt worked in a similar way to Snapchat - users could easily share photos and videos of themselves or write messages. Once installed, the user's Instagram direct inbox would disappear and any messages could only be accessed via Direct.", "description": "Facebook is testing a messaging app for Instagram called Threads, which is designed to promote constant sharing between users and their friends.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9278/3dc65e8b62b547e0bf28a0ba7481995e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
