But as they are in the noise-isolating style, they might not in yours \u2014 especially if you have small ears. Basically, if you\u2019ve used the Jabra 65t headphones, you will know.\n\nOverall, Amazon has done a remarkable job at nailing most of the basics for wireless earbuds, and it even overachieved in one particular place: noise reduction. No, I didn\u2019t say \u201cnoise cancellation,\u201d because even though these use Bose algorithms to reduce noise, they aren\u2019t quite as effective as full-on cans.\n\nBut they are effective. I was easily able to double tap the sides to turn the noise cancellation on and off, and it made a significant difference in the noisy hands-on area at Amazon HQ.\n\nMost important of all: they sound pretty good. I obviously can\u2019t give you anything close to a real judgment on the sound quality, but over the course of a couple of songs, I had no real complaints and was able to pick up some detail in the mids that I guarantee I wouldn\u2019t have heard on AirPods.\n\nBut to say these are better than AirPods would be premature. For one thing, the case is significantly larger on the Echo Buds. For another, it charges via Micro USB, not USB-C. AirPods may use Lightning, but at least that cable isn\u2019t being phased out right now.\n\nThe case is good for 20 hours of listening, with the Buds themselves good for five hours on their own. There is no wireless charging, unfortunately. They are IPX4 water resistant against splashes, sweat, or light rain. They also auto-pause when you pull one out of your ear, thanks to a small IR sensor.\n\nOf course, the Echo Buds are an Echo, so at any time, you can say the \u201cAlexa\u201d wake word, and it\u2019ll sound the familiar chime for your requests. I will say that in the very loud space, I couldn\u2019t really tell if Amazon heard me; the confirmation chime was very subtle and really didn\u2019t kick in until after I\u2019d made my full request.\n\nYou can also long-press to get your phone\u2019s native assistant. The double and long presses are the only controls, by the way. There\u2019s no way to change volume or even pause by default, so far as I could tell. Fortunately, you can change options on either side to different controls if you like.\n\nThey\u2019ll cost $129.99 when they release later this year, making them cheaper than nearly every other major brand of truly wireless headphone, including Apple\u2019s AirPods or PowerBeats Pro headphones, Jabra\u2019s Elite 65t headphones, Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 headphones, Sennheiser\u2019s True Momentum Wireless earbuds, and Jaybird\u2019s Vista model.\n\nAn inexpensive pair of truly wireless earbuds that also manages really effective noise reduction is a very big deal. I think it\u2019s priced to move and will seriously cut into the sales of a lot of those headphones.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
