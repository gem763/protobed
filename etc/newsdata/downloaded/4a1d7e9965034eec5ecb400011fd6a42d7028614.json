Lydia Ramsey/Business Insider\n\nGenealogy giant Ancestry is getting into the business of healthcare.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company announced two health products: AncestryHealth Core and AncestryHealth Plus, which can help users of the company's DNA test get a sense of their family health history.\n\nAncestryHealth Core will cost $149 \u2014 or $49 if users have already taken an Ancestry test \u2014 while Plus will cost $199, and additional quarterly updates after the first six months will cost $49 fee every six months.\n\nHere's what's included in the reports.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFor the first time, family-history website Ancestry will tell you about your genetic health.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 36-year-old firm known for its family tree resources announced that it'll offer two new products: AncestryHealth Core and AncestryHealth Plus.\n\nBoth will provide information like carrier status for genetic conditions, cancer risk and wellness reports and can help users get a sense of their family health history as well as ancestry.\n\nRead more: Ancestry's DNA test has traced the family histories of more than 15 million people. Now the genealogy giant plans to get into healthcare.\n\nWhat's included in an AncestryHealth test\n\nTo order an AncestryHealth test, Ancestry will link consumers up with a doctor via the company PWNHealth. Next, the user will fill in information about their family health history. Results will be presented one at a time, incorporating the family health history into a conversation about health risks.\n\nFrom there, users can choose to better understand the results via videos, text, interactive webinars, or directly talking to a genetic counselor. The report can also be printed out and taken to a doctor.\n\nIt's a different route than rival 23andMe has taken. 23andMe's health reports are available directly to consumers once they're cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAncestry plans to offer two health products:\n\nAncestryHealth Core , which will provide health reports about carrier status for rare conditions parents could pass on to kids, like cystic fibrosis, inherited cancers, heart disease, and wellness information about nutrition and metabolism. Georgiadis characterized it as reports that doctors consider the most actionable. AncestryHealth Core will cost $149, or $49 if users have already taken an Ancestry test.\n\n, which will provide health reports about carrier status for rare conditions parents could pass on to kids, like cystic fibrosis, inherited cancers, heart disease, and wellness information about nutrition and metabolism. Georgiadis characterized it as reports that doctors consider the most actionable. AncestryHealth Core will cost $149, or $49 if users have already taken an Ancestry test. AncestryHealth Plus will offer more reports and the plan is to add additional info over time as the science advances. The test will be run on next-generation sequencing technology rather than the genotyping technology Core and the standard AncestryDNA test is run on. Unlike genotyping, which looks for specific parts of DNA and pieces them together, next-generation sequencing looks at only the protein-encoding parts of your genome, called the exome. The next-generation sequencing analyzes roughly 2% of those 3 billion base pairs. The test will cost $199, which includes six months of quarterly updates and additional educational resources. After that, it's $49 every six months for the quarterly updates, or $100 a year.\n\nUsers who have already submitted their spit to Ancestry before don't have to submit a new samples. The products will take about 6-8 weeks to report after ordering, even for those who have already taken the Ancestry test. The company said it plans to have the Plus program available widely in 2020. To perform the next-generation sequencing test, Ancestry's partnering with lab-testing firm Quest Diagnostics.\n\nHere's what Ancestry's health reports will look like.

It also reports predisposition for conditions like familial hypercholesterolemia and some variants associated with inherited breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n23andMe's consumer genetics test can also tell users if they have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, tests that Ancestry did not choose to include.\n\nThe report also comes with wellness screenings that show based on genetics how individuals might process caffeine or lactose, the sugar found in milk.
