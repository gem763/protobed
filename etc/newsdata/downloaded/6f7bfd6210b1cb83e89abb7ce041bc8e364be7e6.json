That's almost completely inconceivable.\n\nHere's a look at his statement at a Minneapolis rally, his first since Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry of Trump's actions as president:\n\nTRUMP: \"If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they're not even close.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 \u2014 Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2014 China's economy could not have caught up to America's.\n\nEven if the U.S. economy had not grown at all since 2016, China's gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of economic output \u2014 would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to pull even with America's. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year \u2014 something even China's super-charged economy has never approached.\n\nThe Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America's. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States. But it's got a long way to go to surpass the U.S.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck", "description": "President Donald Trump declared Thursday that if his opponent had won the 2016 election, China would have overtaken the U.S. as the world's largest economy by now.
