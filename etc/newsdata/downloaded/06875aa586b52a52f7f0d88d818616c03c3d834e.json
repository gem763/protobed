She said it was 'slightly marred by the view of the main road behind the hotel grounds', although when she raised concerns about this, she was informed trees have been planted to combat the issue\n\nThe two swimming pools at the resort are framed by palm trees and daybeds, yet be warned, says Rebecca, unless you're willing to wake up at 5am every morning and reserve a spot, it's highly unlikely you'll get a spot to sit poolside\n\nIf you struggle to get a sunlounger at the pool, you can head to the sandy beach, which is only a five-minute walk away from the complex\n\nAlthough the hotel aims to provide a much-needed sense of calmness and tranquillity there are also options for the more adventurous, with a sandy beach only a five-minute walk away, and the hotel is 3.7 miles east of the bustling city of Rethymnon.\n\nAs an uneducated oenophile I also ensured that I took advantage of the nearby vineyards, spending one day on a private tour with Wine Walkers Crete, which provided transport from the hotel.\n\nAs a vegetarian it can be hard to find food choices abroad, and although the hotel's buffet-style restaurant ensured there were plenty of choices for those with dietary requirements, the labelling on foods wasn't clear.\n\nIt's worth checking with the chefs exactly what they've used in the dishes or, as I did, you run the risk of tucking into what is labelled a spinach lasagna\u2026 but contains chunks of chicken.\n\nRebecca said the hotel's buffet-style restaurant ensured there were plenty of choices for those with dietary requirements\n\nThe hotel features a spa with an extensive treatment menu, hot tub, sauna and zen relaxation zone. If you prefer group activities the hotel also offers yoga, meditation and tai chi classes\n\nThe bohemian 'hippie chic' vibe continues through the entire hotel with a fusion of wood, wicker and stone furnishings\n\nWhile the daytime is more relaxed, with guests invited to lounge by the luxurious pool, in the evenings there's more of a party vibe, with live music played beneath the giant poolside teepee\n\nThe USP: A picturesque retreat that, whilst aimed at millennials, also caters to the more mature holidaymaker.\n\nThe rooms: Spacious, homely and every room boasts a private balcony, either with a mountain or pool view, equipped with free wireless internet, satellite TV and refrigerator.\n\nThe food: Every meal is buffet-style and whilst there's a variety of meals on offer, the labelling could be clearer.", "description": "The Syntopia by Orion is billed as a 'gypsetters' haven, writes Rebecca Lawrence, a sanctuary for free spirits and an idyllic setting for those who want to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/05/10/18099208-0-image-a-4_1567675230263.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
