Tokyo\u2019s measures struck a nerve in South Korea, where many still resent Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule from 1910 to 1945.\n\nAccording to South Korean trade ministry, the new measures in effect mean it might take up to 15 days for South Korean companies to gain approvals to export sensitive materials to Japan, compared to the five days or less it took under a simpler inspection process provided for favored trade partners.\n\nLee Ho-hyeon, a South Korean trade ministry official, said the change would affect about 100 local firms that export items such as telecommunications security equipment, semiconductor materials and chemical products to Japan. He said Seoul will work to minimize disruption to South Korean companies.\n\nJapan for decades has enjoyed a huge trade surplus with South Korea, an economy that\u2019s much more dependent on exports. Many major manufacturers heavily rely on parts and materials imported from Japan.\n\nBut the dispute is taking a toll. Exports to South Korea from Japan fell 9.4% last month, Japan\u2019s Finance Ministry reported Wednesday.\n\nThe trade dispute between the neighbors erupted in July, when Japan imposed tighter export controls on three chemicals South Korean companies use to produce semiconductors and displays for smartphones and TVs, major export items for South Korea. It cited unspecified security concerns over Seoul\u2019s export controls.\n\nA few weeks later, Japan dropped South Korea from its own trade \u201cwhite list,\u201d triggered a full-blown diplomatic dispute that took relations between the U.S. allies to their worst in decades.\n\nThe dispute has spilled over to security issues, with Seoul declaring it plans to terminate a bilateral military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan that symbolized the countries\u2019 three-way security cooperation with the United States in the face of North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat and China\u2019s growing influence.\n\nFollowing an angry reaction from Washington, Seoul later said it could reconsider its decision to end the military agreement, which remains in effect until November, if Japan relists South Korea as a favored trade partner.\n\nSeoul announced its plans to downgrade Tokyo\u2019s trade status in August before holding a 20-day period to gather opinions on the decision, during which the Japanese government voiced opposition to the move it described as \u201carbitrary and retaliatory,\u201d Lee said.\n\nHe said Seoul needs to strengthen controls on shipments to a country that\u2019s \u201chard to cooperate with\u201d and fails to uphold \u201cbasic international principles\u201d while managing export controls on sensitive materials.\n\nSouth Korea previously divided its trade partners into two groups in managing export controls on sensitive materials. Following Wednesday\u2019s change, South Korea now has an in-between bracket where it placed only Japan, which would mostly receive the same treatment in trade as the non-favored nations in what had been the second group.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Korea on Wednesday dropped Japan from a list of countries receiving fast-track approvals in trade, a reaction to Tokyo's decision to downgrade Seoul's trade status amid a tense diplomatic dispute.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/correction_south_korea_japan_75681_c0-207-3894-2477_s1770x1032.jpg?670c4c68fc81091ad4950b99f4979b1debc8c34c", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
