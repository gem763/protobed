(Menahem Kahana/Pool via AP)\n\nIsrael is still weeks away frombreaking the deadlock produced by last week\u2019s general election, but one result is already clear: The country\u2019s minority Arab population is ready to be heard.\n\nA surge of Arab voters proved decisive in denying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the parliamentary seats he needed to extend his decade in power as Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader. Turnout among Israel\u2019s 1.8 million Arabs spiked 10 percent over the previous election, nearing 60 percent, following a campaign in which Netanyahu relentlessly demonized Arab citizens as enemies of the state and a threat to security.\n\nA slate of four Arab parties picked up 13 seats in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament. And this week, most of those parties bucked a three-decade tradition of sitting out the country\u2019s messy post-election haggling by formally recommending that Netanyahu\u2019s chief rival, former army chief Benny Gantz, get the right to form a governing coalition.\n\n\u201cWe are forcing ourselves into the political system,\u201d said Ayman Odeh, head of the Hadash party and leader of the successful Arab slate, known as the Joint List. \u201cNo one will give us the equality that we deserve, so we are going to take it for ourselves.\u201d\n\nIt is Odeh, a Hebrew-speaking, New Testament-quoting Muslim, who could get credit for sparking this Arab moment. A member of parliament since 2015, he was able to corral a fractious Arab political spectrum \u2014 from communists to Islamists \u2014 into the Joint List, which won the third-largest number of Knesset seats after Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party and Netanyahu\u2019s Likud.\n\nAs negotiators from the two largest parties entered a second day of talks on the possibility of a unity government that could determine how much influence the Arab faction would wield, Odeh sat in a beachside cafe here and reflected on his success so far.\n\n\n\nAyman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List alliance, gives out election pamphlets during a campaign rally in the Arab Israeli city of Tira, north of Tel Aviv, on Sept. 5, 2019.

Odeh recorded a direct appeal to Jewish voters, in Hebrew, that went viral the day before the election. Some 20,000 Jewish citizens voted for him, Odeh said, clasping his hands in gratitude.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree that all the Arabs are against all the Jews,\u201d Odeh said. \u201cI see another equation, that Arabs and democratic Jews are against the occupation and discrimination.\u201d\n\nNot all Arabs share Odeh\u2019s rosy, humanitarian view. His appeal for Arab lawmakers to play a more active role is viewed by many in his community as appeasement. His decision for the parties to formally recommend Gantz \u2014 who as army chief oversaw a bloody 2014 campaign against Hamas and other militants in the Gaza Strip that killed some 2,000 Palestinians \u2014 lasted only hours before one of the Arab factions, Balad, backed out, with one of its members labeling Gantz a war criminal.\n\n\u201cThe time is not right for this type of involvement with Israeli politics,\u201d said Balad founder Jamal Zalhalka.\n\nIn recent decades, Arab politicians have stood outside the government structure, taking office as Israeli parliamentarians but keeping their distance as a protest against official policies toward the Palestinians in the occupied territories.\n\n\n\nThis file combo image created on April 2, 2019, shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and retired Israeli Lt.

His party could not support a coalition with either Netanyahu\u2019s ultra-Orthodox partners or Gantz\u2019s potential Arab supporters, he said.\n\nOdeh, for his part, is waiting for the always-shifting process of forming a government to play itself out, confident that the movement he has helped set in motion can gain momentum regardless of the outcome. His hope, he said, comes largely from his experience growing up in Haifa, a cosmopolitan port city where Israel\u2019s many factions live side-by-side.\n\n\u201cIn Haifa, it\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not equality, but it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOdeh remembers neighborhood soccer games with Arab and Jewish boys playing together and then arguing over who really won the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. When Odeh was 14, his father, a builder, sent him to a Christian school, where he became a reciter of Bible verses. On Sunday, when he presented the Joint List recommendation to President Reuven Rivlin, he quoted Psalm 118: \u201cThe rock that the builders cast aside has become the cornerstone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also read the Torah several times,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still deeply rooted in my own religion, but everything that is beautiful in Jewish culture I\u2019m willing to accept.\u201d\n\nOdeh is willing to push even deeper into the governing structure. Under one of the many scenarios under negotiation \u2014 a unity government combining Likud and Blue and White \u2014 Odeh\u2019s Joint List would rank as the second-largest bloc in the Knesset. That would put Odeh in line to be the country\u2019s first Arab opposition leader, a role that includes a security detail and intelligence briefings.\n\nHe knows that would likely be a step too far many, Jews and Arabs alike.\n\n\u201cI would do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this, they might not let happen.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Led by a Bible-quoting Muslim, Arabs helped deny Netanyahu the victory he sought.", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Feature Writer Without Portfolio Based On Local Enterprise But Filing For National", "Foreign", "Magazine", "Other Sections", "Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KKP0Af-YDgxTuDSgDzDRKB5v8Bo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JYVJETG6HYI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
