The goods most likely to be flown are either perishable, highly valuable or urgently needed \u2014 flowers, jewelry or vaccines, for example.\n\nThe rise of online shopping and a bounce back in global trade volumes since the recession saw air cargo volumes grow by 50 percent between 2008 and 2018, from 39.9 million tons to 56.1 million tons, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization. Although air freight is expected to shrink in 2019 due to trade tensions between the EU, the U.S. and China, Boeing forecasted last year that air cargo traffic would more than double by 2037.\n\nAmazon has announced a host of new environmental targets, pledging its shipments would be fully carbon-neutral by 2040.\n\nAll those flights add up to some serious pollution; freight transport makes up a fifth of aviation\u2019s contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions, according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation.\n\nThat's increasingly untenable in a world very aware of the dangers of climate change. Last month, tech giant Amazon announced a host of new environmental targets, pledging its shipments would be fully carbon-neutral by 2040.\n\nBut asked how the company can reconcile its climate targets with the popularity of next-day deliveries and air freight\u2019s carbon footprint, a spokesperson said: \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge.\u201d\n\nDirty business\n\nThose cargo planes need airports, but there's a growing reluctance to tolerate noise and pollution. The Dutch government is considering a recommendation to end night flights to rein in aviation\u2019s carbon footprint. The U.K. parliament\u2019s transport committee last year called on the government to ban night flights at London Heathrow airport.\n\nIn Belgium, the newly formed government of the Wallonia region promised to tax jet fuel in a move that would target passenger and freight operations at Charleroi and Li\u00e8ge airports.\n\nHowever, IATA, an airline lobby, said in May that restrictions on night flights should only be imposed \u201cas a last resort\u201d and only at airports \u201cwith a demonstrated noise problem.\u201d It argued restrictions would add further congestion to airports already at capacity, and disrupt sensitive supply chains for medicines and perishable goods.\n\nSensing the pressure to decarbonize, French shipping company CMA CGM in May launched a \u201cpharma division\u201d aiming to boost the share of medicines and drugs being transported by sea instead of by air. A separate international shipping industry initiative called Poseidon aims to do the same thing.\n\nAdding to the problem, airlines often use older, noisier and dirtier planes to move cargo. Even as a new generation of quieter and more fuel-efficient planes are deployed for passenger services, Boeing still manufactures its older 767 jets solely for logistics companies.\n\nA spokesperson for logistics giant UPS said the company is working on making its air fleet more efficient by buying new aircraft and using route-planning software to optimize routes and landing procedures. It also said it is investing $2 billion in its ground network.\n\n\u201cFor our customers who don\u2019t necessarily require next-day delivery, this is an economical alternative,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cEnhancements to our network mean that 80 percent of Europe\u2019s population can be reached within two business days using our most economical ground-based service.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will stop the flying if customers say they are happy to wait a few weeks for their new stereo\" \u2014 Official from a logistics company\n\nThe biggest obstacle to moving items off planes, however, is time.\n\nDanish shipping company Maersk takes 55 days for a ship to go from Rotterdam to Yantian in China. The revamped rail connection between China and Europe halves that time, but only an airplane guarantees next-day delivery.\n\nSpecial delivery\n\nExpress deliveries are also a lucrative source of business for logistics companies like UPS, DHL and FedEx, which charge customers a premium for getting their stuff delivered as soon as possible.\n\nOne official from a logistics company, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to changes in customer expectations as the factor likely to have the biggest impact. The industry says it is obliged to put goods in planes and fly them into European airports at 3 a.m. because people demand them the next day.\n\n\u201cWe will stop the flying if customers say they are happy to wait a few weeks for their new stereo,\u201d the official said.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
