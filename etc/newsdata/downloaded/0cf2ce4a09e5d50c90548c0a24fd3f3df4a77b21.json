They were all like the back of the green like on top of a hill, so it was tough to get it close.\n\n\u201cI just leave a couple short, but really happy the way I played.\u201d\n\nAmericans Richy Werenski (65), Nate Lashley (65) and Robby Shelton (70) were tied for second at 13 under at White Sulphur Springs.\n\nAdam Long (70) and Scottie Scheffler (71), the second round co-leader with Niemann and Shelton, were another stroke back in the first tournament of the new PGA Tour season.\n\nLashley, with an eagle at the 17th, had shared the lead with Niemann before a bogey at the last.\n\nKevin Chappell also had his troubles.\n\nAfter becoming the 10th player to break 60 on the PGA Tour with a 59 on Friday, the American soared to a three-over par 73 with four bogeys.\n\nNiemann, in his third season on the tour, had played 46 holes without a bogey.\n\nBut the streak ended after an errant tee shot at the 11th.\n\nHe rebounded with five pars and a birdie at the 17th before closing with another par that came after a 49-minute weather delay.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago I was playing this same event as an amateur, and I never thought I was going to be leader in two years,\u201d said Niemann, who first played at White Sulphur Springs as an 18-year-old.\n\n\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m almost a member here. I just like being out here. Always when you play on a course that you know already it helps a lot. Yeah, I think this is the course I have played more on tour, so, yeah, helps a lot.\u201d", "description": "Chile's Joaquin Niemann shook off his first bogey of the week to take a two-shot lead into the final round of the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
