Gen. Ed Thomas.\n\nSome in Congress have questioned whether military members\u2019 use of hotels owned by President Donald Trump amounts to a conflict of interest for the president.\n\nThe Air Force said aircraft, particularly C-17 cargo planes, have increasingly used nearby Prestwick Airport as a refueling stop in recent years. From 95 stopovers in 2015, including 40 overnight stays, the number jumped to 257 last year, including 208 overnight stays.\n\nThrough August this year, there were 259 Air Force aircraft stopovers at Prestwick, including 220 overnight stays, according to the Air Force. It said Prestwick is considered a leading choice for reasons such as favorable weather and less aircraft parking congestion. Fuel at Prestwick is purchased at a U.S. government-negotiated rate.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said he did not know whether the increased use of Prestwick has also led to an increase in use of the Trump Turnberry hotel.\n\nCongress is investigating stays at Trump properties by government employees, including Air Force personnel.\n\nTrump said on Twitter on Monday that he knew nothing about the crew\u2019s stay at Turnberry.", "description": "The Air Force is reviewing how crews on international travel choose airports and hotels after one crew recently spent a night at a Trump resort in Scotland.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ972_turnbe_ZG_20190909193958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
