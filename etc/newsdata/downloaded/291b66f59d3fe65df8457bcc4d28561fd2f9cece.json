I felt the blood drain from my body. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mom?\u201d \u2019\n\nShe says she has blotted out many details of being \u2018trapped in my own home with a man three times my age and three times my size [\u2026] raping me\u2019. But she has a clear memory of him later asking her: \u2018How does it feel to be whored by your mother for 500 dollars?\u2019\n\nShe said nothing at the time. But now, aged 56, she answers his question: \u2018It feels,\u2019 she says, \u2018like you are an orphan.\u2019\n\nBorn in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1962, Moore was the eldest child of Virginia \u2018Ginny\u2019 King and Danny Guynes: a charismatic, but combustible, couple.\n\nGinny was strikingly attractive, socially ambitious and \u2018different from other moms\u2019.\n\nDanny was \u2018a charming gambler . . . not boring. The kind of guy who is always riding on the edge, getting away with something\u2019.\n\nThe 56-year-old (pictured) who grew up believing that Danny Guynes was her father, was about to turn 18-years-old when she found him dead in his car\n\nWhen Demi was four, her brother Morgan was born. She remembers a long drive during which her mum handed her a bottle of beer \u2018which I slowly administered to him, the way you\u2019d give a baby a bottle of milk. Needless to say, by the time we arrived at our destination he wasn\u2019t screaming any more\u2019.\n\nThe family lived on the run from creditors and the fallout from Danny\u2019s affairs. Demi calculates she changed school, on average, twice a year. This is how she learned to act. At each one, she observed how the cool kids behaved and mimicked them.\n\n\u00a3394m The gross profit of the 1990 film Ghost, starring Demi Moore\n\nShe also honed her acting by concealing the traumas of her family life. One night, she awoke to sounds of distress. Her mother had taken an overdose of pills and her father called to Demi for help.\n\nDanny restrained Ginny while Demi used \u2018the small fingers of a child to dig the pills my mother had tried to swallow out of her mouth\u2019. She vividly remembers her mother \u2018flailing like a wild animal, and the sound of my father screaming directions at me\u2019.\n\nShe felt safest on the occasional periods when she was hospitalised for a kidney condition. In hospitals, responsible adults maintained reliable routines and consistent care. Demi could relax.\n\nDemi (pictured in Indecent Proposal) was sent to rehab for drug and alcohol addiction by the St Elmo team\n\nBut, by the time she reached her teens, Demi had discovered that Danny was not her biological father. The month before she turned 18, he committed suicide, aged 36. It was Moore who found him, slumped over the steering wheel of his car with the engine running. By then, she trusted nobody and was conditioned to \u2018crave extremes\u2019. This emotional detachment and yearning for highs followed her into her acting career and future relationships.\n\nDemi married her first husband, musician Freddy Moore, three month\u2019s after Danny\u2019s death. She was signed to the famous Elite modelling agency, then won a role in the popular soap opera General Hospital. From there, she joined the \u2018Brat Pack\u2019 actors Rob Lowe (with whom she had a brief romance) and Emilio Estevez (to whom she became engaged) in the cast of the 1985 coming-of-age movie St Elmo\u2019s Fire.\n\nBut, by then, the wheels were coming off. The St Elmo\u2019s team sent Moore to rehab for drug and alcohol addiction. She quit the booze and coke, but used food to control her anxieties.\n\nIn the Eighties and Nineties, as she became one of the sex symbols of her generation, Moore battled with her body image: starving herself, hating herself and exercising to the point of exhaustion. It has been a long journey from seeing herself from the \u2018outside in\u2019 to the \u2018inside out\u2019 of the book\u2019s title.\n\nMoore was swept off her feet by actor Bruce Willis in 1987. He hired limos and took her on her first \u2018proper\u2019 restaurant dates. They married and had three daughters very quickly.\n\nDemi recalls becoming dependent on her third husband, Ashton Kutcher (pictured), who was 15 years younger\n\nBut Willis was never settled with Moore. She thinks he was unfaithful, and she was well versed in switching off emotionally while smiling for the cameras.\n\nMoore is proud of the way she changed the culture by being photographed naked and pregnant for the cover of Vanity Fair in 1991. But understandably angry at how she was portrayed as the money-grabbing \u2018Gimme Moore\u2019.\n\nLead roles in Ghost, A Few Good Men, G. I. Jane and Striptease saw her become the highest-paid woman in Hollywood, and the misogynistic Press were out to get her. She notes that nobody condemned Willis for greed, even though he was paid $20 million for his third Die Hard movie at that time, almost double her fee.\n\nShe writes that she was always taught to push for the highest amount. And behind the millions was always the child sold for 500 dollars. I ached for the girl who wanted to push her price beyond what money could buy.\n\nINSIDE OUT by Demi Moore (Fourth Estate \u00a320, 272 pp)\n\nIt\u2019s sad to read of Moore\u2019s break-up with Willis and her equally doomed third marriage (2005-2013) to Ashton Kutcher, 15 years younger. He allowed Moore to open up about her past trauma, but damaged her further by inviting other people into their bed (confirming her fears of not being \u2018enough\u2019) and encouraging her to start drinking again.\n\nAfter she miscarried and IVF failed, he cheated on her, they divorced, and she sank back into addiction and anorexia that saw her blue-lighted to hospital in 2012. Inside Out has a happy ending, for now. Moore is a flawed human, taking public responsibility for her failings \u2014 although I have no doubt that, at her worst, she was more difficult and damaging to be around than she pretends.\n\nThe fact that her daughters cut contact with her for years speaks volumes. Her youngest, Tallulah, was arrested for underage drinking at 17 and Demi did not hug her when she went to collect her from the police station. Tallulah thought her mum cared only about the family reputation \u2014 then the other two cut contact, too.\n\n\u2018The girls were angry I\u2019d become so dependent on Ashton \u2014 I was addicted to him is the best way I can put it. And I prioritised my addiction over my needs and the needs of my family.\u2019\n\nBut her ability to reconnect with both them and herself deserves our respect.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had extraordinary luck in life,\u2019 she writes, \u2018both good and bad. But we all suffer and we all triumph, and we all get to choose how we hold both.\u2019", "description": "Demi Moore, who is best known for 1993 movie Indecent Proposal, reflects on her life in a new memoir.
