This is obviously a highly significant decision by them (Facebook).\n\n\"It is important that there be parliamentary scrutiny, not just in this country but other countries are having this debate as well. We decided to call him as we want to understand how they (Facebook) will balance the competing interests between privacy, security and law enforcement.\"\n\nFacebook is facing intense criticism over plans to implement end-to-end encryption in its Messenger app, which has more than one billion users worldwide.\n\nAnnouncing the decision earlier this year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it would mean even Facebook would be unable to see what users were sending to each other.\n\nLast week the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, wrote to Mr Zuckerberg warning the move would make it harder for police to catch terrorists and child abusers.\n\nShe said: \u201cCompanies should not design their platforms to create a digital blind spot where paedophiles and terrorists have free rein to conceal their despicable crimes.\n\n\u201cThis is not about just one company. However, we are particularly concerned about Facebook\u2019s current proposal to apply end-to-end encryption across its messaging services.\u201d\n\nThe company also came under fire from Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs Council's lead on child protection, who said the encryption plan would \u201cknowingly put the safety of children at risk\u201d.\n\nSir Nick joined the social media giant last year as its head of global affairs and communications, reporting directly to Mr Zuckerberg, 35.", "description": "Nick Clegg is to be summoned to parliament to give evidence on Facebook\u2019s plans to encrypt its Messenger service, the Telegraph has learned.", "authors": ["Mike Wright", "Social Media Correspondent", "Howard Riddle", "Philip Johnston", "Iain Duncan Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000204875800-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
