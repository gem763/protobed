After John Gruber pointed out on Twitter that I forgot to mention that Google didn\u2019t put USB-C headphones or an adapter in the Pixel 4 box in the review, I realized that I had a whole series of thoughts about it that have been rumbling around in my head all weekend. (I have also updated the review.)\n\nIn the spirit of this newsletter, which has a tradition of taking a small thing and showing how it is instructive in understanding a big thing, I\u2019m going to dwell on headphones for a bit.\n\nAhead of the event where Google formally announced the Pixel 4, I once again asked the perennial question: is Google serious about hardware? The quality of the phone itself is only part of the answer. The other part is Google showing a real commitment to selling more of them.\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about computers, gadgets, and software. You should subscribe!

The most obvious \u2014 and the one I\u2019ve been focused on \u2014 is that it needs to put a real marketing budget behind the Pixel 4, especially now that it\u2019s available on all four major carriers.\n\nBeyond that, though, Google has one very important job: make it easy for iPhone users to switch. It is a very, very difficult thing to convince anybody to . Whether you think it\u2019s because of iMessage lock-in, OS preference, brand loyalty, or all of the above \u2014 iPhone users tend to stay on their platform.\n\nMore than any other Pixel before it, the Pixel 4 seems almost custom-designed to appeal to iPhone users. It has the same face unlock system (minus, you know, the closed-eye problem). It comes much closer to matching iOS\u2019 animation smoothness thanks to its 90Hz screen. Android 10 liberally \u201cborrowed\u201d the core gesture navigation mechanic from iOS. Hell, because it shares the square camera bump, the thing looks like an iPhone.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think Google is going to make a big push to convince iPhone owners to switch \u2014 it may not even push as hard as it did last year with its \u201cPhone X\u201d ad campaign. Because if Google wanted to convince iPhone owners to switch, it would take a small hit on the Pixel\u2019s profit margin (even if it\u2019s negative to begin with) to make it easier to do so.\n\nIf Google was really serious about getting iPhone users to switch, it would have included USB-C headphones and an adapter in the box.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard, Google isn\u2019t including either USB-C headphones or a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle in the box with the Pixel 4. (There are headphones in the box in France and Australia due to their laws, apparently.)\n\nIt strikes me as a silly corner to cut, because iPhone owners are less likely than Android owners to already have a USB-C dongle or USB-C headphones. When I asked Google why, here\u2019s what a spokesperson told me over email:\n\nMost of our customers already use their personal audio accessories and, for those people, the extra in-box audio accessories end up going to waste. We\u2019re also offering a $100 launch promo credit for purchases on Google Store so customers can get accessories they want.\n\n(That promo credit ends on October 26th, by the way.)\n\nGoogle is probably right that most people buying the Pixel 4 already have Bluetooth headphones, but that\u2019s not exactly the point. A backup pair of wired headphones is still essential, I think, and it\u2019s practically punitive for Google not to include them.\n\nWhat are the chances that retail employees will warn potential switchers that they also need to get headphones? And then how will potential switchers feel when they open the box and discover that there are no headphones in the box \u2014 unlike every other phone? As a first time experience of the Pixel 4, the one-two punch of losing iMessage and not having an easy way to listen to music seems ...not ideal.\n\nI\u2019m not against the idea of not including accessories due to waste. In fact, I look forward to the day when we no longer expect to get AC adapters in the box because everything is powered by USB-C and we all have plenty of them. But in 2019, not including headphones in the box feels like a cut corner.\n\nThe feeling that Google is cutting corners is a problem that goes beyond just headphones. Look at any part of the Android web this week and you\u2019ll find that a significant portion of the community has already soured on the Pixel 4. There\u2019s a worry that the small storage and skimpy battery on the Pixel 4 doesn\u2019t compare well to competition like the OnePlus 7T.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Android fans who will be looking at the spec-to-price ratio, either. An iPhone 11 with 128 GB of storage and much longer battery life can be had for $749.\n\nI think I understand why Google priced the Pixel 4 the way it did. It\u2019s the first Pixel with face unlock, a 90Hz screen, and a radar chip. None of that is free. Plus, it\u2019s totally fair for a company to charge a premium for a product that includes a premium camera and better software experience.\n\nThose are all reasons why I didn\u2019t ding the Pixel too hard for its price. (I\u2019m also aware that Google has discounted every previous flagship Pixel on a regular basis and expect the same to happen with the Pixel 4.) So I\u2019m not arguing that Google should be lowering the price on the Pixel because it doesn\u2019t have headphones in the box.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m suggesting that omitting the headphones from the box is a tacit admission that Google doesn\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to get iPhone owners to switch. It\u2019s targeting other Android users instead, users who\u2019ve probably been using USB-C with their phones for some time.\n\nI think that\u2019s a missed opportunity. I don\u2019t know that the Pixel 4 would have been able to get a lot of iPhone switchers this year \u2014 especially since Apple caught up on camera quality with the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. But I do know that Google is going to have to try to get them sometime.\n\nI\u2019m probably thinking too hard what it means for Google to have left out the headphones from the Pixel 4 box. But the more I consider it, the more I believe that when it came to the decision about whether or not to include them, Google wasn\u2019t thinking hard enough.\n\nStories from The Verge\n\n+ Why spacesuit design choices \u2014 not women\u2019s physiques \u2014 delayed the first all-female spacewalk\n\nWhat an ingenious idea! So much of tech progress is defined by speeds and feeds: faster processors and more RAM and whatnot. I love these moments when progress comes from sheer ingenuity. There\u2019s obviously a lot of tech to be developed, but the core idea of this new kind of spacesuit is great:\n\nThese suits are still your standard air-pressurized suits, which Newman describes as engineering marvels, but still really hard to move in. That\u2019s why she has been researching a new type of spacesuit altogether, one that provides the necessary atmospheric pressure not with air, but by pressing down on the person\u2019s skin. With the right materials and patterns, the suit would adhere to the wearer\u2019s body, compressing the skin and allowing the person to function normally.\n\n+ Microsoft Surface Pro 7 review: I wish this looked like a Surface Pro X\n\nHere is Tom Warren with The Verge review of the Surface Pro 7. It\u2019s a fine update but Microsoft\u2019s design here is starting to feel a little tired.\n\n+ Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 15-inch review: it\u2019s a bigger Surface Laptop\n\nDan Seifert reviewed the Surface Laptop 15-inch. It is ...a 15-inch Surface Laptop, which means it\u2019s big not not a powerhouse. If you just want a Surface with a big screen that doesn\u2019t have the wingdings of the Surface Book, this is your jam.\n\n+ Google\u2019s Nest Mini is a great-sounding upgrade over the Home Mini\n\nCameron Faulkner reviews the new Nest Mini. My advice: don\u2019t buy it at full price. If past is precedent then this thing will be discounted left and right. You\u2019ll trip over it walking into electronics stores. They\u2019ll be used as packing material for Google hardware shipments. Google likes to drop the price on these things, is what I\u2019m saying.\n\nThe ultrasonic sensor on the speaker is neat, but I\u2019m waiting for Google to put a Motion Sense radar chip in these. It would work fine through fabric and be more useful that it is on a phone. I\u2019m sort of confused why that didn\u2019t happen on Nest products this year \u2014 maybe they wanted to but decided it wasn\u2019t accurate enough and bailed and went to an ultrasonic sensor. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n+ HTC now has an entry-level blockchain phone\n\nOkay, sure, um, but why?:", "description": "The Pixel 4 seems almost custom-designed to appeal to iPhone users.
