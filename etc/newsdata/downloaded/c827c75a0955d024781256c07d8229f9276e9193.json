The big update brought many changes to the game, and besides a new weapon and a new legend, the video game developer released the World's Edge, a brand new map. While the first two seasons had been rather underwhelming and disappointing, the third season is much more interesting and it has received positive feedback from the community so far.\n\nReleased on February 4, 2019, \"Apex Legends\" will have its first Halloween event this month. Many other popular games, such as \"Overwatch\" and \"Fortnite Battle Royale,\" have had Halloween events every year, and Respawn Entertainment will follow suit. Data miners revealed some big things that are coming to the popular video game with the upcoming event, and there is no doubt that players are going to love it!\n\nBig things are coming for Halloween\n\nRespawn Entertainment hasn't officially announced the Halloween event for \"Apex Legends,\" but we can expect it to happen soon considering that Halloween starts in late October. The video game developer accidentally uploaded a badge for the event in the loading screen, and data miners Shrugtal and That1MiningGuy have found more info about the things that will be added with the event.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

According to the data miner, this is going to be a new map caleld Shadowfall and it will basically be a reskinned nighttime version of the King's Canyon map, the map used in the first two seasons of the video game.\n\nAdditionally, the event will be called Fight or Fright and it will also bring new cosmetic items and a new game mode.\n\nThat1MiningGuy found Halloween skins for every \"Apex Legends\" character, including Crypto, the character added in Season 3. Bloodhound will have a Jack-o'-lantern-inspired skin, while Wattson's skin (which can be seen in the tweet below) has bats on it. Additionally, Caustic will get a creepy-looking clown skin for the event.\n\nWattson has one too pic.twitter.com/hEB8bvAQgW \u2014 That1MiningGuy (@That1MiningGuy) October 2, 2019\n\nZombies and the new game mode\n\nThe new map will bring a new free-for-all game mode where players will respawn after dying. They will come back to life as zombies with increased mobility and brutal melee attacks. The match will continue until there are 10 living players in the game and they will have to fight zombies off until a rescue dropship arrives.\n\nBeside these changes, we can expect a lot more items to be added with the Halloween patch, including gameplay and cosmetic items. The event will most likely start around October 30, so make sure you don't miss it!", "description": "Respawn Entertainment is preparing a huge Halloween event in 'Apex Legends.'", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Asmir Pekmic", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Asmir Pekmic", "Tfue Responds Amid Ninja 'Fortnite' Feud", "'He'S Always Hated Me'", "The Bouncer Trick Lets 'Fortnite' Players Jump Into Enemy Boxes", "Pat Riley Comments On The Miami Heat", "Chris Paul Situation", "Says He'S Happy With Butler"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/7/os/b_1200x630/zombies-are-coming-to-apex-legends-credit-wob-source-youtube_2335621.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
