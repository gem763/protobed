Closed-door hearings / transparency. \u201c...House investigators have broken through the administration\u2019s stonewalling of Congress and heard dozens of hours of testimony from key witnesses,\u201d Russell Berman and Elaine Godfrey report. \u201cThe public, however, has seen virtually none of it\u2014and that dynamic could ultimately threaten the Democrats\u2019 bid to get public opinion firmly on their side.\u201d\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\n\ud83d\uddd3Tuesday, October 22: Bill Taylor, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, will testify in Congress as part of the impeachment inquiry. Taylor expressed concern about a Trump quid pro quo in text messages that were unearthed, but whatever fireworks happen won\u2019t be visible to the public.\n\n\ud83d\uddd3Wednesday, October 23: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will head to Capitol Hill to defend his company\u2019s plan to create a cryptocurrency. The public hearing comes as the tech giant faces public scrutiny from \u2026 just about everyone over just about everything. How did the last time go? It was a \u201cfree-for-all,\u201d Elaina Plott wrote at the time.\n\n\ud83d\uddd3Thursday, October 24: Elijah Cummings, the Maryland congressman at the center of the House\u2019s impeachment investigation before his unexpected death last week, will lie in state at the Capitol on Thursday and Friday. The revered representative had a knack for personal friendships with Republicans with whom he publicly sparred.\n\n\ud83d\uddd3Friday, October 25: The Second Step Presidential Justice Forum kicks off in Columbia, South Carolina, featuring nearly all of the major Democratic presidential contenders, as well as their Republican opponent: Trump will deliver the keynote speech. In the Trump era, criminal-justice reform has emerged as a rare space for bipartisanship\n\nArgument of the Day\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was quoted calling a 2020 longshot Tulsi Gabbard a \u201cfavorite of the Russians.\u201d The Hawaii representative responded, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers.\u201d It was an unnecessary interjection by Clinton, Tom Nichols argues:\n\nThe congresswoman from Hawaii is a completely discreditable candidate\u2014more on that in a moment\u2014but Clinton\u2019s accusation that Gabbard is a tool of the Russians was so blunt and clumsy that it has added new life to a primary bid that should never have existed in the first place. Within a day, Gabbard was already fundraising off of it, a development as predictable as a sunrise.\n\n\u2192 Read the rest\n\n+ More from Tom: \u201cTrump\u2019s admissions on social media alone provide enough material for Congress to remove him.\u201d\n\nBefore You Go\n\n(Andrew Kelly / Reuters)\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill ideas, and they can\u2019t die either ... I\u2019d like to see him live through one term at least.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what one supporter told our campaign reporter Isaac Dovere, who was at the Bernie Sanders rally in Queens on Saturday (25,000-people strong, with a personal endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez).\n\n\u2192 Read the full story\n\nAbout us: The Atlantic\u2019s politics newsletter is a daily effort from our politics desk.
