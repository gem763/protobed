Kamala Harris says her Department of Justice would review state restrictions and stop them by executive order if they violate the Constitution. The policy harkens to enforcement of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts, though there is no federal statute protecting abortion.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she would propose and enact such legislation, although that would require Democratic majorities in Congress, a stylistic departure for Klobuchar who touts bipartisanship.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker says he would try to codify the right, as well as establish a White House-level Office of Reproductive Freedom.\n\n___\n\n10:10 p.m.\n\nThe three oldest candidates in the Democratic presidential field are facing questions over their age during Tuesday night\u2019s debate.\n\nBernie Sanders is the oldest candidate at 78 and just returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack. He declined to answer when asked how he would reassure Americans of his good health, saying only that he would run a \u201cvigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d\n\nSeventy-six-year-old Joe Biden argued that his experience and wisdom are assets because \u201cI know what has to be done\u201d as president. He also promised to release his medical records before the first nominating contest in Iowa in February.\n\nAnd Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s 70 years old, promised to outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, including the Republicans.\n\n___\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nMany of the Democrats seeking the White House say they would lead administrations that would go after drug companies that manufacture addictive opioid medications.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris said during Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate that she would prosecute pharmaceutical executives as \u201chigh-level dope dealers\u201d for peddling what they knew to be dangerously addictive medications. Former Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said drug companies need to \u201cbe held accountable.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who said the companies\u2019 actions are evidence of \u201cwhat unfettered capitalism is doing to this country\u201d by way of the massive profits made by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said they support decriminalizing small amounts of opioid drugs as a way to promote safe use.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (BOO\u2019-tuh-juhj) exchanged sharp words over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposed mandatory buyback of assault rifles.\n\nButtigieg last week criticized the idea as a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from more achievable efforts such as universal background checks and banning the sale of the weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, Buttigieg criticized O\u2019Rourke as not having a plan for how the buyback would work.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said the different ideas are not mutually exclusive. He says gun violence \u201cis a crisis and we gotta do something about it.\u201d O\u2019Rourke says candidates should listen to victims, not polls, consultants and focus groups.\n\nButtigieg shot back, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\n___\n\n9:55 p.m.\n\nFormer U.S. Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro says that \u201cpolice violence is also gun violence\u201d and that he would not give officers \u201canother reason to go door to door\u201d by supporting mandatory surrender of assault weapons.\n\nCastro was the first candidate on Tuesday\u2019s 2020 Democratic primary debate stage to raise last weekend\u2019s shooting death of Atatiana Jefferson, killed in Castro\u2019s home state of Texas after a neighbor called 911 requesting a welfare check on her Fort Worth home because the front door was ajar. Jefferson was playing video games early Saturday with her 8-year-old nephew when Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean fatally shot her within seconds of arriving at her house.\n\nCastro\u2019s remarks were met with applause by the audience.\n\n___\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she supports removing members of the American military from the Middle East.\n\nWarren said Tuesday during the Democratic presidential debate: \u201cI think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nWarren added that it has to happen in an appropriate, thoughtful way.\n\nDemocrats at the Democratic debate in Ohio have largely scorned President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy. Former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (BOO\u2019-tuh-juhj) are among those arguing that Trump is abandoning U.S. allies and weakening the nation\u2019s standing around the world by abruptly pulling troops from northern Syria.\n\n___\n\n9:45 p.m.\n\nThe Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nomination are discussing ways to check the power of Russia\u2019s leader as part of a condemnation of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy decisions.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said Trump is \u201cturning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire\u201d by \u201cshowing moral weakness\u201d in the face of strength of leaders like Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe conversation followed on a debate about Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from northern Syria, something former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said could lead to future U.S. deployments.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden stressed a focus on diplomacy, saying the U.S. currently has \u201can erratic, crazy president who doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection.\u201d\n\n___\n\n9:40 p.m.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (BOO\u2019-tuh-juhj) is sparring with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate, with Buttigieg calling Gabbard \u201cdead wrong\u201d for her earlier support of withdrawing troops from Syria.\n\nGabbard\u2019s previous stance, as well as her decision to meet with Syrian President Bashar Assad, came under fresh scrutiny following President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the country, paving the way for Turkey to invade and kill the Kurds.\n\nGabbard has criticized Trump for how he\u2019s conducted the withdrawal but said Tuesday that while Trump has \u201cthe blood of the Kurds on his hands \u2026 so do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.\u201d\n\nButtigieg says the killings are \u201cthe consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.\u201d\n\nBoth Buttigieg and Gabbard are military veterans.\n\n___\n\n9:20 p.m.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker spent much of the first hour of Tuesday\u2019s crowded Democratic presidential debate playing the role of diplomat.\n\nIn the primary, Booker has run as a happy warrior, pitching a strategy of love over hate to defeat President Donald Trump. As other candidates sparred over health care, income inequality and impeachment on Tuesday, Booker used his time to step between his opponents, calling for unity, agreeing with their points and shifting the focus back to their common enemy.\n\nBooker cautioned against \u201ctearing each other down because we have different plans\u201d in response to several candidates\u2019 criticism of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plans on a wealth tax and health care. He also called former Joe Biden a \u201cstatesman\u201d in defending him after the former vice president was asked about his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n___\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nFormer Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke is accusing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren of sometimes being \u201cpunitive\u201d in her policy ideas.\n\nIn Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, O\u2019Rourke says Warren sometimes \u201cis more focused on being punitive, or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.\u201d\n\nWarren says she is shocked at that notion.\n\nWarren responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d emphasizing that fortunes are built in part by workers and benefits enjoyed by taxpayers.\n\nWarren, a front-runner in the race, has been the target of criticism from several other candidates throughout the debate.\n\n___\n\n8:55 p.m.\n\nMany Democrats seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination stress a need to improve the nation\u2019s jobs picture, but they disagree on how to do that.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s debate in Westerville, Ohio, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders defended his federal jobs guarantee, saying equalizing the economy will create the need for more teachers and doctors.\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang, who backs a universal basic income, said people \u201cdo not want to work for the federal government.\u201d Promoting her own plan to boost social security, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said her proposal would cover retirement for even those in nontraditional positions, like stay-at-home caregivers.\n\nSeveral, including former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, advocated strengthening unions to keep businesses like GM from moving production to other countries.\n\n___\n\n8:40 p.m.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is taking fire from her Democratic opponents for refusing to answer whether her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan would raise taxes for the middle class.\n\nWarren has refused to directly answer when asked how she\u2019d pay for her proposal, and during Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate, she once again dodged, insisting only that \u201ccosts will go down\u201d for the middle class. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg knocked Warren for the nonanswer, saying her failure to offer a direct answer is \u201cwhy people are so frustrated with politicians\u201d and arguing that Medicare for All would \u201cunnecessarily divide this country.\u201d\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the Medicare for All legislation that Warren has embraced, said it was \u201cappropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up.\u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also piled on, saying, \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest\u201d and arguing in favor of a public option instead.\n\n___\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nJoe Biden is defending both his actions and those of his son in dealing with Ukraine.\n\nAt Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, the former vice president said his son Hunter \u201cdid nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong.\u201d Biden was answering a question about why he has pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were to be elected president while insisting his son\u2019s dealings with foreign countries were above board during Biden\u2019s vice presidency.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry over his effort to have Ukraine investigate Biden.\n\nBiden urged that the focus go back on Trump, saying, \u201cRudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven the fact that they are flat lying.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8:25 p.m.\n\nThe 12 Democratic presidential candidates debating in Ohio are unified in saying Congress has no choice but to begin impeachment against President Donald Trump, though not all for the same reasons.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says no one is above the law. Her fellow top contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, called Trump the \u201cmost corrupt president\u201d in the course of American history.\n\nWarren and Sanders said they found the president worthy of impeachment as a result of the Mueller report, which detailed 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice in the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker says it\u2019s imperative that Congress\u2018 decision on impeachment be \u201cabout patriotism and not partisanship.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nThe fourth debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway with the largest field yet on stage together at a pivotal time in the campaign.\n\nTwelve candidates are debating Tuesday in Ohio. At center stage are front-runners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Another top-tier candidate, Bernie Sanders, is back just two weeks after suffering a heart attack and suspending his campaigning.\n\nIt could be the last 2020 presidential debate for some candidates. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard have not yet met fundraising and polling thresholds to participate in the November debate.\n\nAlso participating are California Sen. Kamala Harris, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.\n\n___\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nA trio of Iowa officials is criticizing the Democratic National Committee for instituting polling and fundraising thresholds to participate in the presidential debates, complaining they\u2019re artificially winnowing the field of candidates and usurping the job of Iowa caucusgoers.\n\nIowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Iowa DNC member Jan Bauer said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday that most Iowans are not tuning into the Democratic presidential debates and have not yet made up their minds.\n\nThe call was organized by Montana Gov. Steve Bullock\u2019s presidential campaign. Bullock has failed to make the stage for recent debates, including Tuesday\u2019s in Ohio.\n\nMiller and Bauer have endorsed Bullock.\n\nFormer Iowa Democratic Party Chair and former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle said the DNC is shutting out those without access to wealth or name recognition.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nDemocrats are confronting a rapidly shifting political landscape as a dozen candidates meet on Tuesday for the most crowded presidential debate in modern history.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry that has put President Donald Trump on the offensive has also reordered the political calculus for Democrats, especially Joe Biden. The former vice president is facing baseless - but persistent - allegations of wrongdoing overseas from Trump and his allies.\n\nHis early front-runner status is also under threat from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. But as she rises, Warren is also fending off new questions about her biography.\n\nAdding to the drama, Bernie Sanders is recovering from a heart attack that raised questions about his ability to withstand a campaign and about who might win his support if he had to drop out.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the fourth Democratic presidential debate (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/election_2020_debate_18148_c0-210-5025-3141_s1200x700.jpg?8f4b2dc09f1705e863d61c56d5da045dc3806623", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
