Obamacare tried to subjugate that freedom by forcing health providers to perform procedures that violated their best medical judgment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is right to revise Obamacare\u2019s unlawful regulation that was blocked from taking effect by a federal court. It would have forced physicians to offer sex-reassignment procedures and abortions despite strong ethical and medical concerns.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cNo American should be forced to violate deeply held beliefs, especially in hotly debated issues in health care. All Americans should be able to choose health care and health insurance that best fits their needs and beliefs.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Following reports that the Trump administration has revised a rule in the Affordable Care Act that unlawfully redefined the meaning of \u201csex\u201d for certain nondiscrimination provisions, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Emilie Kao, director of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, offered the following response:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
