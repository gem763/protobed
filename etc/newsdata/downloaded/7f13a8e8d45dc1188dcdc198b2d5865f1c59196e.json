Donald Trump warps time. He generates so much news, most of it insane, that sometimes it feels as if we\u2019ve always been here, reading the same headlines about the same walls closing in a fraction of an inch at a time. So perhaps that\u2019s why I\u2019d nearly forgotten about the infamous Resistance Inside the White House, the existence of which was allegedly revealed by an anonymous author in the New York Times last year. \u201cTo be clear, ours is not the popular \u2018resistance\u2019 of the left,\u201d the author said \u2014 as if anyone assumed otherwise! No, theirs is a uniquely conservative phenomenon. \u201cWe want the administration to succeed,\u201d they continued, \u201cand think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous.\u201d\n\nBecause there is seemingly no limit on how stupid the news can get, the author is now writing a book. On Tuesday afternoon, the Twelve imprint of Hachette Book Group announced that it will publish A Warning in November. The author is still anonymous, identified only as a \u201csenior administration official,\u201d and the book will allegedly provide \u201ca first-hand account\u201d of the president and his foibles. Their agent, Matt Latimer, told the Times and other press outlets that the author \u201crefused the chance at a seven figure advance and intends to donate a substantial amount of any royalties to the White House Correspondents Association and other organizations that fight for a free press that seeks the truth.\u201d\n\nThe book, Latimer continued, \u201cwas not written by the author lightly, or for the purpose of financial enrichment. It has been written as an act of conscience and of duty.\u201d Perhaps. There is obviously a difference between a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of royalties and \u201call\u201d royalties; the author will presumably make some profit from the book. They\u2019ve also set themselves up nicely for a future career once their identity inevitably becomes public, either because they reveal themselves voluntarily, or because someone in the White House or the conservative press figures out who they are. They never specify which of the president\u2019s policies they support, though it seems safe to assume that they share the usual Republican predilections for tax cuts, deregulation, and restrictions on abortion and immigration flows. But whoever they are, and whatever they believe, they can now claim that they were part of a resistance \u2014 if not necessarily the resistance \u2014 all along.\n\nThat risk was obvious the moment the Times published the editorial. The piece was bullshit. The entire premise smelled like bullshit, too. If you belong to a secret resistance, talking about it in public suggests that it\u2019s not actually that sensitive. And their resistance, as the author described it, isn\u2019t all that subversive either. They take pains to clarify that they are not of the left, that their opposition to Trump is based mostly on his perceived threat to right-wing goals, \u201cfree minds, free markets and free people.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s true that the Trump administration would be even worse without the intervention of this mysterious stranger, but it\u2019s impossible for anyone to say with certainty that this is the case. From the outside, the author and his claims represent something quite familiar: the usual Never Trumper lines, issued this time by an anonymous mouthpiece. There\u2019s nothing so explosive about that.", "description": "An anonymous senior Trump official is now writing a first-hand account of the president and the internal \u201cresistance\u201d against him.", "authors": ["Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/22/22-white-house-official-the-warning.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
