He did not give a timeline for any relaxation of the controls.\n\nThe closure has no impact on Nigeria's economically crucial oil exports, which are shipped out almost entirely via the nation's seaports and offshore oil platforms. Ali added that despite the land border closure, it would still be possible for goods to cross at points equipped with special scanners, but did not say where those locations were.", "description": "Nigeria's Land Borders  Closed to All Goods, Customs Chief Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/16/2019101600549_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
