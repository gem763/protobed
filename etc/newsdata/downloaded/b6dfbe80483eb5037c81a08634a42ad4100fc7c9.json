Jim Jordan (R) of Ohio, Rep. Mark Meadows (R) of North Carolina and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who as a Kansas congressman had attacked Clinton by underscoring the solemn role of soldiers in defending U.S. secrets.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have soldiers today in the field, fighting to protect classified information from getting out . . . [risking] a lot of their lives to keep the information safe. And Secretary Clinton handled this in a very different way,\u201d Pompeo told a television host in February 2016, adding that she had violated \u201cmultiple laws.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Meadows dismissed concerns about the communications of the two diplomats, Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, saying their use of personal phones or encrypted apps was acceptable because they ultimately handed over their correspondence to the State Department.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBased on what I\u2019ve seen, I have no concerns,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nThe State Department has not responded to questions about the diplomats\u2019 handling of information, but Pompeo has broadly defended his subordinates, saying \u201ceach of the actions that were undertaken by State Department officials was entirely appropriate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nState Department officials are told to use government-issued phones when conducting official business so that those communications are secure and archived for posterity in compliance with the Federal Records Act and Foreign Affairs Manual. If diplomats send a work-related message on a private platform, they must make a copy of it and submit it for archiving \u201cno later than 20 days after the original creation or transmission,\u201d the manual says.\n\nAD\n\nDespite those rules, the use of WhatsApp and other messaging services is fairly widespread at the State Department, and those who use them often fail to take screen shots of the communications and forward them on in official emails for the archives as instructed.\n\n\u201cFew, few people do that,\u201d said one former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss compliance issues he witnessed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe irony is that Pompeo\u2019s diplomats are using personal devices when he personally went ballistic on Hillary Clinton for that,\u201d the official added.\n\nClinton employed a more elaborate workaround of State Department guidelines through her use of a private server, but some legal experts said the disparity in outrage in the two cases was telling.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c \u2018Pot meet kettle\u2019 doesn\u2019t do the situation justice,\u201d said Brad Moss, a Washington-based attorney who specializes in national security and classification cases.\n\nMeadows said the charges of hypocrisy were not valid because Clinton was mishandling classified material. He said he trusted Volker\u2019s testimony before House investigators last week in which the envoy purportedly said none of his communications were \u201cclassified.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few of them were sensitive, in his opinion, but none from his professional opinion were classified,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, the FBI found that at least 110 emails Clinton sent through a private server contained information that was classified at the time, but other pieces of her correspondence were retroactively classified. That\u2019s something some experts say could happen with Volker\u2019s correspondence, given that the contents included a potential meeting with a U.S. president and security assistance for a country in a military conflict with Russia.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is more likely than not that at least some of the information outlined in those messages will be designated as classified at some level, and those who slammed Secretary Clinton for passive receipt of unmarked emails that later were deemed to contain classified information will be presented with claims of hypocrisy if they now dismiss similar behavior merely because it was done by their political allies,\u201d Moss said.\n\nWhile Volker handed over his messages to House investigators last week, Sondland\u2019s correspondence remains with the State Department. Sondland, who was a hotel magnate and Trump donor before becoming the president\u2019s envoy to the European Union, appears to have played a significant role in trying to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden at Trump\u2019s behest.\n\nAD\n\nSondland was scheduled to appear before House investigators Tuesday, but the State Department ordered him not to do so, a decision that Democrats led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.) protested.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot only is the Congress being deprived of his testimony, and the American people are being deprived of his testimony today, but we are also aware that the ambassador has text messages or emails on a personal device which have been provided to the State Department,\u201d Schiff told reporters Tuesday.\n\nPompeo, who led an aggressive campaign to extract documents and interviews from the State Department as part of a probe into the killing of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, also faced charges of hypocrisy last week when he accused House Democrats of trying to \u201cintimidate, bully and treat improperly\u201d State Department employees through interview requests.\n\nAD\n\nSchiff is now accusing Pompeo of failing to live up to the level of transparency he demanded of the Obama administration, saying Sondland\u2019s messages are \u201cdeeply relevant to this investigation and the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans, led by Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, defended the State Department\u2019s decision to delay the testimony and records disclosures.\n\n\u201cWe fully understand why the administration made the decision they did,\u201d said Jordan, who claimed that Schiff misrepresented Volker\u2019s testimony and therefore could not be trusted with other such testimonies.\n\nMeadows challenged Schiff to prove that Sondland used a personal device, although neither Sondland nor Volker denied the allegation.\n\nExperts in both parties have said that ambiguity in the State Department\u2019s rules and policies on the retention of various messaging applications has long been a problem. Kaylin Minton, a spokeswoman for the House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans, noted that the State Department authorization bill, which passed the House this summer, \u201cattempts to push the department toward adopting uniform guidelines on the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to reform our protocols to keep pace with advancements in technology,\u201d she said.\n\nJulie Tate and Greg Jaffe contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Republican lawmakers dismissed concerns about diplomats\u2019 handling of information.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DzxEAbtSXFne4E8LHT7QmJ2EA_E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UWKFK4XKXEI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
