It was Hall of Fame weekend. Friday night. For 23 minutes, Jordan reflected on an unparalleled basketball career with thank yous and verbal jabs and everything in between. \u201cIt was,\u201d his son, Marcus, says, \u201can authentic showing of who my dad really is.\u201d\n\nTen years later, however, that night is remembered not for what it celebrated, but rather for what it birthed. Not for Jordan\u2019s words, but for the tears that snuck down his cheeks before he could utter any. Not for the GOAT, but for the GMOAT: The Greatest Meme of All Time.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThis is the story of that meme, the Crying Jordan. Of its rise, its power, its ubiquity, and so much more \u2013 but first, of the photograph that enabled it.\n\nChapter 1: The photo\n\n(Note: All identifiers reflect subjects\u2019 titles in 2016.)\n\nMARCUS JORDAN (Michael Jordan\u2019s son): I remember all of it. It as a fun weekend, spent with family. I think it was one of my dad\u2019s most special weekends, and greatest achievements. \u2026 Growing up, I definitely saw him emotional. But I don\u2019t think it was the same emotions he had that day.\n\nSTEPHAN SAVOIA (Associated Press photographer): So he comes up, he\u2019s introduced. He walks up to the podium, and drops his head, and starts crying. Before he said a word. \u2026 As soon as he walked up and his head was down, we knew there was an emotion there that was probably honest in its origin. And it became apparent, once he started talking, that he was truly humbled.\n\nMARCUS JORDAN: The realization that his playing days were over, and just the culmination of his career, led to him being overfilled with joy.\n\nStory continues\n\nSTEPHAN SAVOIA (AP): The Hall of Fame, I\u2019ve probably covered it at least half the years I\u2019ve been working here. I did Charles Barkley, I did a number of the big guys. And there\u2019s never any emotion like that. \u2026 He was overcome by tears. He couldn\u2019t speak.\n\nIt\u2019s not a heavily attended event for press photographers. There\u2019s basically only five or six of us. They all, in that first minute or so, decided, he\u2019s crying \u2013 [after snapping pictures] the Reuters guy pulls his disc, he\u2019s about to file. Once one guy pulls his disc, when you\u2019re in a group like that, everybody starts pulling their disc.\n\nBut Jordan wasn\u2019t done crying. So I just hung in there. And about 10 seconds after they all get their discs in their computers, and they\u2019re in the middle of scanning, Jordan raises his head.\n\nAnd I hit my shutter \u2013 GHRMMMM, rapid-fire.\n\nAnd his head was up for maybe 10 seconds. And everybody turns around and looks, and sees what\u2019s going on, and they\u2019re scrambling for their discs to put back in their cameras. By the time they do, he had wiped his eyes, he was done crying. \u2026 Nobody else had the picture.\n\n[Years later, somebody] said, \u2018The photographer must\u2019ve been pretty good to capture that.\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Actually, it was pretty f---ing easy. If the other guys had hung in for a few more seconds, they would\u2019ve had it too.\u2019\n\nIt was the best one I had. And it went out that night two minutes after 9 o\u2019clock with \u2018AP Photo/Stephan Savoia\u2019 in the byline. That\u2019s how it became exclusive.\n\nNow, how it got to the internet, I have no idea.\n\nThe photo of Michael Jordan that started it all, by Stephan Savoia. (AP)\n\nChapter 2: The untold origin story\n\nBRAD KIM (Editor-in-chief, Know Your Meme): As far as the deep origins, the genesis story of the meme \u2026 is something that we could not pinpoint.\n\nRYAN MILNER (Author, The World Made Meme; professor, College of Charleston): In 2012, it showed up as an image macro.\n\n(An image macro is a photo with witty, sometimes humorous text placed on top.)\n\nBRAD KIM (Know Your Meme): It was uploaded to a meme generator site. \u2026 Its earliest usage after that that we have cited is Nov. 7, 2014.\n\nBut the true Patient Zero appeared seven months earlier \u2013 in April 2014, on a sports and pop culture website called Boxden.\n\nRICO23 (Boxden user): Boxden is pretty much my social media. You can go there for one-stop shopping. It\u2019s basically the Walmart of the internet. You can go there to find out everything that happened in sports, or music. You can keep up with TV shows.\n\nRIKERMY NERIS (Boxden username: Mutant Boy): It\u2019s a great place to go and talk a lot of sh-t.\n\nRICO23: At Boxden, back in the day, before all the memes started, we were using regular pictures in place of memes, in place of emojis. We call it a smiley. That\u2019s just how we express ourselves. We use a lot of pictures, we use a lot of GIFs, a lot of smileys. So I, and maybe a couple other people, were using the actual [Jordan] picture in place of the smileys that we had. But it doesn\u2019t look the same when you use the whole picture. So, somewhere on the website, there was a thread called \u2018Request a smiley.\u2019\n\nRIKERMY NERIS (Mutant Boy): A few members kept asking, \u2018Hey, you should make [the Jordan photo] a smiley.\u2019 \u2026 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yo, this is great, why is nobody doing this?\u2019 A couple of weeks passed \u2026\n\nRICO23: Then I reached out personally to him, and I just said, \u2018Hey, do this right quick.\u2019\n\nRIKERMY NERIS (Mutant Boy): And I said, \u2018You know what? Let me do it.\u2019\n\nRICO23: It definitely started on Boxden, and it was definitely because I asked someone that was better at Photoshop than I was to create it.\n\nRIKERMY NERIS (Mutant Boy): Once I saw it really pop off on Boxden, I knew that it eventually would pop off on other message boards. Once I saw that, I was like, \u2018OK, this is about to be big.\u2019 It just caught fire.\n\nChapter 3: Going mainstream\n\nRYAN MILNER (Author, professor): Twitter, being a site of mass, mainstream participation, is a lot of times one of the last places to get a meme. Crying Jordan, for the longest time, [had] been shared on smaller, more niche sites. On these smaller sites \u2013 meme creators, meme generators, specific forums about specific topics, small places like different corners of reddit, 4chan \u2013 people play with a lot of images in really creative ways. They throw a lot of spaghetti at the wall. \u2026 If something resonates with people, if something clicks or sticks, then other people on that site start playing with it, too. Then they move it out to other sites. And then it moves to your really massive platforms, like Twitter, like Facebook. Months or years later, if that image has clicked or resonated with a lot of people, then it\u2019s massive. So it\u2019s sloooow virality in that sense.\n\nCOBY RICH (Digital media manager, Arizona Cardinals): [In] 2015, or maybe late in 2014 during the NBA season, it started popping up and becoming real popular. And I loved it. Every single one of them cracked me up.\n\nMARCUS JORDAN: Stuff always gets sent to me and texted over to me. \u2026 But the first time I saw it, I kinda just shrugged it off, laughed it off. It was the stereotypical meme that\u2019s making its circulation for 15 minutes. But this one stayed around a little longer.\n\nANDREW WEISS (Co-creator, Crying Kicks, along with Sherman Winfield): Memes are flavors of the hour. That\u2019s what\u2019s so crazy about it. If you look up memes, you can kinda see the shelf life. And people even say, \u2018Oh, it died when white people did it on the news.\u2019 That happened with this, and it still kept going. \u2026 It was just so big on social media, and no matter who you were, where you were from, who you represented, you knew what that was.\n\nTIM BURKE (Video director, Deadspin): At the time that people started doing the Crying Jordans, it seemed just like any other short-lived, heavily saturated meme to me. For reasons I don\u2019t quite understand, it developed into a longer-lasting cultural touchstone.\n\nChapter 4: The highlights and the heyday\n\nTIM BURKE (Deadspin): The one I really remember was the Tom Brady courtroom sketch. Somebody made a Crying Jordan of that. I feel like that was somewhere near the peak of the art form. That was January 2016.\n\nANDREW WEISS (Crying Kicks): It took a life of its own. It literally became slang, in my opinion, the same way some sayings stand the test of time. Whoever messed up that year, as a celebrity, as a sports figure, as a team, as anybody who was \u2018taking an L\u2019 \u2013 they became that meme.\n\nTIM BURKE (Deadspin): There was a team, maybe the Arizona Cardinals, they tried to preempt Crying Jordan by doing it themselves.\n\nCOBY RICH (Cardinals): It was the day of the [2016 conference] championships. The AFC championship was happening earlier in the day. The Patriots were losing, and they were getting showered with it. And I was just consuming it, loving it.\n\nFast-forward three hours, when the Carolina Panthers were on their way to a 49-15 beatdown of the Cardinals \u2026\n\nCOBY RICH (Cardinals): We were getting pummeled. \u2026 The previous year, we had lost to the Panthers in the playoffs, and a member of our digital team tweeted out something about trolls in the basement. And it got such a negative response. \u2026 So I thought I\u2019d do something kinda meta to beat all the trolls. It was just this snap decision. Like, I know it\u2019s coming. So might as well get ahead of it.\n\nI think it garnered 50,000 retweets at the time. I remember dozens of people responding, \u2018Give this guy a raise.\u2019 I kind of knew I was leaving [for another job]. So it was like a walk-off home run.\n\nI remember the Atlanta Hawks being the next to jump on it.\n\nJARYD WILSON (Social media manager, Atlanta Hawks): I remember it very vividly. It was Game 2 of the 2016 conference semifinals. The Cavs were burying us. They set the record that night for the most threes [in a single NBA game]. We were down 40 at half I think, or something like that.\n\nSo, it was myself and another woman who was working with me, we kinda came to the conclusion together: This is the opportune moment. Let\u2019s react the way a Hawks fan would react to this, and make it a little lighthearted.\n\nI don\u2019t think we expected it to do as well as it did. I don\u2019t think you ever do. But those are moments that really make your brand stand out and have a distinct voice.\n\nBut what did his Hawks bosses think of it?\n\nJARYD WILSON (Hawks): Yeah, they hated it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just teams Crying Jordaning themselves. In January that year, Florida Panthers goaltender Roberto Luongo slapped it over his own face. The following month, with his hometown Panthers losing the Super Bowl to the Denver Broncos, Steph Curry contributed to the craze.\n\nA Look into my soul right now...but it's all good we will be back! pic.twitter.com/fKbDjGx0on \u2014 Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) February 8, 2016\n\nLater in February \u2026\n\nDWYANE WADE, speaking at NBA All-Star Weekend in 2016: Every time I look at social media, that\u2019s all you see, man. It\u2019s the picture seen around the world.\n\nDEMAR DEROZAN, speaking at NBA All-Star Weekend in 2016: An internet hit. They put \u2019em on everybody, man. They put \u2019em on everybody.\n\nCARMELO ANTHONY, speaking at NBA All-Star Weekend in 2016: That\u2019s the funniest meme that\u2019s online right now.\n\nSTEPH CURRY, speaking at NBA All-Star Weekend in 2016: I think it\u2019s about to go into extinction.\n\nSpoiler alert: It was not.\n\nJIMMY DONOFRIO (Prolific Crying Jordan maker): It was so versatile that it was hard not to use it. It was hard not to see things and see opportunities. It was too good not to use. I used it once politically. The republican logo, I turned it into a Crying Jordan.\n\nJIMMY DONOFRIO (Prolific Crying Jordan maker): And the Jordan Spieth Masters one.\n\n12th Hole at Augusta is pretty tough, just look at the overhead #TheMasters pic.twitter.com/abqh8co3xj \u2014 Jimmy Donofrio (@JimmyDonofrio) April 10, 2016\n\nANDREW WEISS (Crying Kicks): The people you would least expect [were getting Crying Jordan\u2019d]. Because, like, everyone fails. And everyone has a misstep. And the more public of a misstep you made, whether it was losing a game in the last second, or being fired, you got that meme. And it worked.\n\nSad day for Andrew Jackson... pic.twitter.com/hCECyK0TA5 \u2014 Bryce Wood (@woodymlb4) April 20, 2016\n\nDAVID OKUN (Creator, Crying Jordan Meme Generator app): The subtle Crying Jordan memes are the best. The ones that are creative and go outside the box. My favorite was the day after Brexit. Obviously the British pound tanked in value. And somebody on the internet took the chart of the pound, and for the area underneath the curve, they put a blown-up version of his face. The value of the pound was getting Crying Jordan\u2019d. That was proof that the meme had really transcended sports, and Twitter in general.\n\nCOBY RICH (Cardinals): I think it was the one-upsmanship and the creativity of the internet that kinda kept it going.\n\nJIMMY DONOFRIO (Prolific Crying Jordan maker): There did come a time where it was so easy to put the head on something that you had to go beyond that. I do remember it going from, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s just put the head on,\u2019 to, \u2018Let\u2019s integrate the head into the body, and change the skin color, and make it look super natural\u2019 \u2026 to actually creating things out of the head that were not heads.\n\nTIM BURKE (Deadspin): For a while, I was messing with the Snapchat Face Swap feature, and I was making videos. I said, \u2018Well, this is a new frontier here.\u2019\n\nJIMMY DONOFRIO (Prolific Crying Jordan maker): I did one of Kevin Durant sitting on the ground, and it was raining, thundering and raining \u2013 but the rain was little Crying Jordans.\n\nBRAD KIM (Know Your Meme): One of the most common questions was, \u2018Will this last? How long will this go on?\u2019 Because even then, its endurance was going to a new level. Up till 2016, there really weren\u2019t any memes that not only survived but stayed at the top of the relevancy charts for an entire year. It\u2019s interesting how Michael Jordan [is] the superlative face of basketball, and the meme itself also became a superlative in its own right.\n\nChapter 5: The peak\n\nThe meme\u2019s true peak \u2013 perhaps qualitatively, certainly quantitatively \u2013 arrived on April 4, 2016. That, of course, was the night Villanova beat Jordan\u2019s alma mater, North Carolina, on Kris Jenkins\u2019 buzzer-beater in the national championship.\n\nSearches for 'Crying Jordan' on Google, August 2014-present.\n\nDAVID OKUN (Crying Jordan app): And you had Michael Jordan sitting in the stands to support UNC. And they lost in epic, epic fashion. And all the cameras immediately panned to him. And nobody was gonna say it out loud, but everybody was thinking: Oh my God, is he gonna cry? Is he gonna cry? And all over Twitter, people were making memes of Crying Jordan sitting next to actual Michael Jordan. At that point it really went through the looking glass.\n\nTIM BURKE (Deadspin): There was a shot of Michael Jordan at the game. And SB Nation made a Crying Jordan version of it that, at the time it came out, there was no context or reason for it. They just Crying Jordan\u2019d Michael Jordan because it was Michael Jordan. Like, there\u2019s no joke there. ... So I, having had access to a different broadcast feed that had a shot of Michael Jordan looking at his phone, realized, well I can have Michael Jordan looking at the Crying Jordan that SB Nation made, and his reaction to seeing it would make him a Crying Jordan.\n\nI really just thought I would put it out there and some other media people would snicker. I would guess that a lot of people who saw this didn\u2019t necessarily get the joke. But it works on its own just in terms of, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Michael Jordan, and he\u2019s seeing that people are making him a Crying Jordan, and it\u2019s making him a Crying Jordan.\u2019 I mostly, though, just wanted to make a statement: This is enough. My entire timeline\u2019s full of Crying Jordans. This isn\u2019t a funny meme. Just stop. The end. Stop it.\n\nSTEPHAN SAVOIA (AP): I was sitting at my laptop, watching the game. The game was over, and there was something from the game I wanted to look at again. And I typed in \u2018North Carolina Villanova basketball.\u2019 And the first thing that popped up was a video of the guy that made that last-second shot, almost at half court. The ball leaves his hand, and it turns into a Crying Jordan ...\n\n\u2026 And it goes through the hoop. I thought that was one of the most clever usages of it. The funniest one I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nChapter 6: What did Jordan think of the meme?\n\nSTEPHAN SAVOIA (AP): I\u2019ve never talked to Michael Jordan, about this or anything else. So I don\u2019t know what he would say, or what he thinks. My understanding was that Jordan was not very happy when he saw it on the internet.\n\nDAVID OKUN (Crying Jordan app): I would love to know what he thinks about it. But he won\u2019t budge.\n\nMARCUS JORDAN: It never really bothered me. I think it kinda comes with the territory. Even my dad\u2019s team really was kinda warm about it, and took it as a joke.\n\nCHARLES OAKLEY, to TMZ in 2016: Nah, he don\u2019t like it.\n\nESTEE PORTNOY (Spokeswoman for Michael Jordan): We think the Crying meme is very funny.\n\nMARCUS JORDAN: I think there was some instances where people were making shirts, or trying to make profits off of using the image, and I think my dad\u2019s team probably took issue with that.\n\nCOBY RICH (Cardinals): I had a Crying Jordan lapel pin at the time. And now somebody bought me a hat with Crying Jordan on it.\n\nANDREW WEISS (Crying Kicks): I remember seeing clothes. There were people selling Crying Jordan sweatshirts. A lot of other people tried to make money off it. \u2026 We didn\u2019t [explore monetizing our Crying Jordan shoe design], because we knew we\u2019d get in trouble. \u2026 [His team] was quoted saying, \u2018We\u2019re having fun with it, it\u2019s all good, but if you try to make money off of it, we\u2019ll come for you.\u2019 And we were like, \u2018OK, we want to benefit from this from an artistic standpoint. We are not gonna sell it.\u2019\n\nMARCUS JORDAN: I think the one thing most people didn\u2019t know was that it was [almost] used in a recent shoe release, but didn\u2019t make the final cut. The Jordan Brand shoes that just came out, the No L\u2019s, the first sample featured the Crying Jordan face in the sockliner on the inside of the shoe. Obviously, it didn\u2019t get approved. But the first sample definitely does have the Crying meme on the sockliner.\n\nESTEE PORTNOY (Jordan spokeswoman): The Jordan Brand doesn\u2019t use memes on our apparel.\n\nANDREW WEISS (Crying Kicks): I can only imagine how much money they would\u2019ve made. But I think it was a very vulnerable thing for him to even comment on it. For him to make a shoe about it would\u2019ve been such an interesting thing to do. Even a T-shirt would\u2019ve gone far. And that surprised me that they never did anything. But it\u2019s a really treacherous place for a brand to be. \u2026 That is kind of messing with the logo, and the equity of the brand. I can only imagine the weird pitfalls that would\u2019ve been experienced.\n\nChapter 7: Why did Crying Jordan resonate?\n\nTIM BURKE (Deadspin): I never really thought that they were particularly funny in the first place. And so, why Crying Jordan became a hit meme, and not something else, I\u2019m not super sure. But it did. \u2026 I really can\u2019t think of any meme that\u2019s ever been like Crying Jordan. It stands alone in its power and stupidness.\n\nRYAN MILNER (Professor, author): In my research, I talk a lot about resonance, and how memes resonate with people. And the first lesson is that you can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to resonate with people.\n\nJIMMY DONOFRIO (Prolific Crying Jordan maker): One of the most important aspects of it is that it\u2019s Michael Jordan. Like, he\u2019s known for the successes in his life. Greatest basketball player of all time \u2013 arguably. Runs of championship wins. He\u2019s gotta be a billionaire at this point. There\u2019s nothing really about the guy that says his life is sad. And yet \u2026 we have this snapshot in time, where this super successful [man] looks like he is devastated.\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t devastated, right? This was a happy moment. It\u2019s that subversion of reality, which is what is really the best part of it. It conveys a whole lot of emotions that are not there. At all. It\u2019s not even sad! And I think that\u2019s why it works so well in the sports world.\n\nMARCUS JORDAN: I think, just because of how great my dad is, and how people idolize him, and how he\u2019s almost not even human to certain people, is why the meme is so impactful. You take him at that vulnerable moment \u2026 you never really got a chance to see my dad fail. It\u2019s kind of an ironic statement on who he is and who he isn\u2019t.\n\nRYAN MILNER (Author, professor): There\u2019s a humor that comes from the combination of Michael Jordan and crying. This is kind of in the weeds, but what makes stuff funny often comes down to something called incongruity. If there is a disconnect between the expectation and the reality, in a way that\u2019s not completely shocking but a little jarring, a lot of times that\u2019s why we think something\u2019s funny. \u2018Appropriate incongruity\u2019 is that theory.\n\nSo what you have with the Crying Jordan meme is you have a really masculine, really iconic celebrity; also a figure who\u2019s pretty stoic, and known to not be overtly emotional. If anything, he\u2019s got a reputation for being kind of a jerk, right? But then you have this incongruity of him red-eyed, in tears, like really, really crying. And so if you\u2019re a sports fan, and you\u2019re a basketball fan, you say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s kind of off.\u2019 That helps the image resonate.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s beautiful about memes. In the original context, you have the subject \u2013 you have Michael Jordan \u2013 crying not in a way that expresses any kind of sadness. But when you move an image from one context to another, you don\u2019t need him to be sad anymore. You just need the visual marker of this person crying. And then all of a sudden those tears can be applied in other ways. So it\u2019s versatile, in that way. It\u2019s ambiguous. You can use it beyond its original context.\n\nTIM BURKE (Deadspin): And there\u2019s a broader discussion to be made about this concept that modern humor is context-less, and that people react to things because they recognize that they\u2019re funny, not because they get the joke. And \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a lot of shows that are super context- or subtext-sensitive that are extremely popular despite the audience, I\u2019m quite sure, not actually getting the root of the joke. Family Guy\u2019s kind of a good example of that. So you can have a lot of memes that are popular for that reason.\n\nANDREW WEISS (Crying Kicks): So it\u2019s very weird and deep. But it\u2019s also still the internet. It\u2019s the internet, man. It does its own thing.\n\nChapter 8: Reflections\n\nSTEPHAN SAVOIA (AP): People have said to me, is this the greatest picture I\u2019ve ever shot? And I kinda laugh. First of all, I\u2019ve won two Pulitzers. I\u2019ve been all over the world covering all kinds of events. It\u2019s nowhere near [the best]. I would never even include it in a portfolio.\n\nOf course, my kids \u2013 it really began to piss me off, I actually had a talk with them \u2013 for a year afterwards, [they\u2019d say,] \u2018Oh yeah, my father\u2019s a photographer, he shot the Jordan meme.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be known for that!\u2019 It\u2019s not that I\u2019m embarrassed by it. But if you look at the content of work I\u2019ve done in 40 years, that\u2019s a minor moment in a career.\n\nBut as I begin to build a website, at some point, I guess the Crying Jordan [photo] will go up with one of the memes next to it. Because people that know, they cite that, when I\u2019m introduced, as the first thing. And I cringe every time.\n\nRIKERMY NERIS (Mutant Boy on Boxden): I\u2019m just glad that Jordan had that moment. And felt that happiness. Cuz that\u2019s what it was. He was happy. He wasn\u2019t sad. But that happiness says so many different things. It can convey so many different emotions. It\u2019s just perfect. I\u2019m glad that he exists on this planet, because if it wasn\u2019t for that moment, and for him existing, I mean, I would have not had so many laughs. It was perfect.\n\nRICO23 (Boxden): I never really think about it that much. But when I do, it\u2019s just kinda like, \u2018Wow!\u2019 Who can believe some guy in IT who lives in Cincinnati came up with the idea to make a meme so popular that everyone \u2026 is using it?\n\nRIKERMY NERIS (Mutant Boy on Boxden): I honestly never even told anyone. I never really cared about getting any recognition for it. If you\u2019re in a bar and you tell people, they\u2019re gonna look at you like, \u2018OK weirdo.\u2019 It\u2019s just so silly to me. It\u2019s nothing I\u2019d want to put on my grave when I die. \u2018MJ Cry creator.\u2019 You know, like \u2026\n\nHe pauses to reconsider.\n\nYou know, it would be funny, I should do it.\n\nJARYD WILSON (Hawks): It\u2019s clearly iconic. \u2026 And every time it\u2019s used, I still laugh. Like, it\u2019s not even just sports anymore. You see it in news, you see it in pop culture and entertainment, you see it in politics, you see it everywhere.\n\nJIMMY DONOFRIO (Prolific Crying Jordan maker): As the Crying Jordan kind of started to wane a bit, other stuff came in and tried to take its place. Like Steph Curry\u2019s white shoes, the Chef Currys. Crying Jordan had hit a peak. People were like, \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 And they wanted so badly for something to be next. And I don\u2019t really think that anything will be next on that level.\n\nRIKERMY NERIS (Mutant Boy on Boxden): It feels like it will never end. It\u2019s the perfect facial reaction to, \u2018Oh, man, you lost that girl? You had that chance and you didn\u2019t do it?\u2019 Aw, boom, you put that [Jordan] face. \u2018Oh, you lost your job? Oh no, poor guy\u2019 \u2013 boom.\n\nIt\u2019s never gonna go away.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nHenry Bushnell is a features writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Question?
