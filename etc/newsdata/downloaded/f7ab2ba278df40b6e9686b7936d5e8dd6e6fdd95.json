Reuters / Henry Browne\n\nWales beat France 20-19 after South African Peyper sent off France lock Sebastien Vahaamahina for elbowing Aaron Wainwright in the face when France were leading 19-10 early in the second half.\n\nA picture being circulated on social media appears to show a smiling Peyper in the middle of a group of celebrating Welsh fans, raising his elbow to seemingly mimic the violent incident that led to Vahaamahina\u2019s sending off.\n\nFrench Rugby Federation vice president Dr Serge Simon said on Twitter: \u201cThis photo, if it is true, is shocking and explanations will be necessary.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby issued a statement saying it was aware of the picture but that it would be \u201cinappropriate to comment further while we are establishing the facts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an unusual occurrence for match officials to mix socially with fans after rugby internationals. However, under tournament rules referees are not allowed to talk to the media.\n\nThe head coaches from both teams involved agreed it had been the correct decision to send off Vahaamahina, who had earlier scored France\u2019s first try in the match.\n\nWales\u2019 Warren Gatland said on Monday he did not consider the picture to be a major issue. \u201cHe\u2019s had his 50th cap and he\u2019s posing with fans,\u201d he said of the widely-respected ref.\n\n\u201cThe way things are and how PC everyone is, people like to make mountains out of molehills. That\u2019s how I view it.\u201d\n\nVahaamahina is scheduled to attend an independent judicial committee hearing into his sending off on Thursday.", "description": "A leading French rugby official has demanded \"explanations\" after a photograph emerged of referee Jaco Peyper appearing to pose with Wales fans mimicking a key red-card incident from Sunday's World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443382774&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K139-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
