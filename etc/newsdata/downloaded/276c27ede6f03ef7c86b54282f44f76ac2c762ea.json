REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo\n\nAs many as 16 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, with many saying higher costs to keep its one-day delivery Prime members happy played a big part in weaker profits.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, it is difficult to assess when Amazon will once again begin to deliver profit upside. We think that the buildout of next day delivery is likely to take several quarters, and don\u2019t expect a return to outsized profits anytime soon,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.\n\nAmazon\u2019s median price target is $2,220, a 33% premium to where its shares are indicated to open. The shares are trading down at $1,734.70.\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's profit: here\n\nAmazon was again hurt by heavy investments to speed up deliveries to its Prime members as it tries to beat back Walmart Inc, which is swiping market share.\n\nAmazon expects costs to cater to Prime members to nearly double to $1.5 billion during the holiday season from what it spent on one-day delivery during the second quarter.\n\nThe company reported sales growth of 24% to $70 billion in the third quarter, but its prediction of $80 billion to $86.5 billion sales in the fourth quarter fell short of the $87.4 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nHoliday sales typically pull in a major share of retailers\u2019 revenue and profit.\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's holiday quarter: here\n\nAmazon also disappointed on slower revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s traditionally lucrative cloud business.\n\nDaniel Liu, research analyst at Canalys, said Microsoft Corp\u2019s Azure cloud business narrowed its gap with AWS during the third quarter. AWS accounts for nearly a third of the global cloud market.\n\nAWS revenue grew by 35% year-on-year and came in slightly below Microsoft\u2019s Commercial Cloud revenue growth of 36%, according to Shebly Seyrafi, CFA Managing Director, Technology & Internet Research at FBN Securities .\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's cloud business: here\n\nMost analysts, however, stood by Amazon\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nNicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said Amazon\u2019s revenue continues to grow at an astonishing, and for rival retailers probably alarming, rate, adding that robust cash generation meant that Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos would be unfazed.\n\n\u201cWhether all the extra investment will be worth it in the end is perhaps open to question, especially given the lackluster sales guidance for next quarter. But it\u2019s been foolish to doubt Amazon in the past,\u201d Hyett said.\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's costs: here", "description": "Shares of Amazon.com Inc were down 3% on Friday, as investors were let down by a lower-than-expected sales outlook and surprised by slower revenue growth at its lucrative AWS cloud business.", "authors": ["Noor Zainab Hussain", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444875830&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O12T-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
