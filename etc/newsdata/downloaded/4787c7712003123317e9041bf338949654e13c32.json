Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday announced her first endorsement of a 2020 congressional primary challenger over a Democratic incumbent, throwing her high-profile support behind Marie Newman\u2019s bid to unseat Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois.\n\nNewman, who is backed by Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped elect Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, challenged conservative-leaning Lipinski for Illinois\u2019s 3rd Congressional District seat last year, but lost by about 2,000 votes. The eight-term House member is one of the few Democrats with a record of opposing abortion rights and discrimination protections for LGBTQ people.\n\n\u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times.\n\nMarie Newman, a former advertising executive, ran against Rep. Dan Lipinski in 2018 but lost by about 2,000 votes.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nShe said in a statement Tuesday that she\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d to receive Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support and hopes to work with her in Congress on policies focused on social, climate and economic justice issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched my community grow and progress and [Lipinksi] fall behind,\u201d Newman tweeted in response to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement. \u201cThis is about electing someone who knows this district, who will fight for bold progressive policies that will make life more affordable for everyone.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve watched my community grow and progress and my Congressman fall behind. This is about electing someone who knows this district, who will fight for bold progressive policies that will make life more affordable for everyone. #NewDayInIL03 #IL03 https://t.co/YlfkHP9EQS \u2014 Marie Newman (@Marie4Congress) September 17, 2019\n\nJustice Democrats has taken aim at several Democratic incumbents in the 2020 congressional elections, hoping to replace them with progressive-leaning candidates, including immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros in Texas and former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau adviser Morgan Harper in Ohio.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement follows the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s push to protect House Democrats from primary challengers. The group implemented a controversial policy earlier this year that cuts off business with vendors who work with candidates who are mounting primary challenges.\n\nThe DCCC did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is growing in our movement to make the Democratic Party fight for solutions as big as the problems we face and create a party that fights for its voters, not corporate donors,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, said in a statement.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
