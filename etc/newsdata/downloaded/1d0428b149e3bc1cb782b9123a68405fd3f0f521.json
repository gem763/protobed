Libra executives have said they are committed to addressing all regulatory concerns before launch.\n\nOn Tuesday, Clayton underscored that the use of such currencies must comply with existing regulations, adding that he has a problem with potential digital assets that could evade those rules.\n\n\"Cryptoassets, while they have benefits...can present a great deal of risk, particularly in cases where, in form, they are the same as securities or the same as currencies, or the same as payment systems, but they're not regulated in the same way,\" he said.\n\nCommissioner Hester Peirce, a Republican who has spoken more favorably of cryptocurrencies, said \"I would like to see us be a little more forward thinking\" on the use of utility tokens, which are services or units of services which can be digitally bought.\n\n\"I am hoping we can work to create some sort of safe harbor,\" Peirce added.\n\nTuesday's hearing is the first time since 2007 that a congressional panel has heard testimony from the full complement of SEC commissioners and its chairman on the agency's oversight.\n\n(Reporting by Katanga Johnson and Pete Schroeder; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission repeatedly refused to tell a congressional panel on Tuesday whether or not Facebook's Libra would be regulated as a security under his watch.", "authors": ["Katanga Johnson"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
