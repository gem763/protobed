But it won't do anything for the temperatures and it will be cold both by day and by night.\n\n\"Some showers across the north of Scotland, maybe one or two down the eastern shores of England.\"\n\nHe added that there would be the first widespread frost of the season this morning.\n\nSub-zero temperatures are expected early this morning in Scotland, with -1C predicted in several places.\n\nThe mercury will struggle to climb above 10C today, peaking at 11C.\n\nSimilar sunny conditions are expected tomorrow as temperatures remain fairly low as forecasters predict 12C highs.\n\nThe expected flooding is the result of recent heavy downpours.\n\nThe heavy showers had cleared on Sunday after torrential rainfall on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe Met Office said the worst of the rain is over, with minor showers in parts of Scotland and the north-west of England on Sunday.\n\n\"It was just Friday and Saturday that we saw the really heavy and prolonged rainfall,\" meteorologist Sophie Yeomans told the PA news agency.\n\nThe heavy rain led to several football matches being cancelled, train delays and flooded roads.\n\nDownpours caused flooding in Northwich in Cheshire and the evacuation of the local marina in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nNorthwich local Julian Williams said the worst was over now with the floodwaters subsiding.\n\n\"It's a beautiful day today,\" he said.\n\n\"The rain was continuous for over 24 hours. We did have something similar happen about two years ago but it wasn't as bad as this weekend.\"\n\nThe Environment Agency is working to confirm the river level in Northwich which is believed to have peaked at Hayhurst Bridge on Sunday morning when it reached 2.826 metres.\n\nIts previous highest record was on November 7, 2000 when it peaked at 2.45 metres.\n\n\"River levels will remain high over the next few days,\" flood duty manager Neil Davies said.\n\n\"Our incident rooms will remain open in affected areas and we have deployed temporary flood barriers in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Cheshire to help keep people and properties safe.\"\n\nMet Office five-day weather forecast\n\nToday\n\nMost areas bright with long periods of sunshine, albeit hazy across southern England. Most parts dry, but some showers over northern Scotland and the far east of England. Cloudier and windy over Cornwall where rain at times for some.\n\nTonight\n\nAnother cold night with a touch of frost for many. Most areas dry, but a few showers over northern and eastern Scotland and eastern England. Windy in the far southwest.\n\nTuesday\n\nMost areas fine and bright. Mostly dry, but expect scattered showers over northern and eastern Scotland and eastern England and patchy rain over Cornwall. Windy over Wales and southwest England.\n\nOutlook for Wednesday to Friday\n\nAreas of extensive cloud, rain and drizzle push northeast, replacing the cold and clear conditions seen on previous days. Temperatures will gradually recover to near average.", "description": "The Environment Agency has predicted torrential flooding across England, issuing 226 flood warnings and alerts", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Chas Breton Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740180.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Seasonal-weather-Herefordshire-UK-26-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
