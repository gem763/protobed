This week, we talk with one Senator from Arkansas who, along with her colleagues, are interested in bringing better broadband to rural areas of her state, Breanne Davis.\n\nDuring the 2019 session, she introduced SB 150, which was ultimately adopted. The bill makes slight changes in Arkansas law that prevent local communities from developing infrastructure to be used for broadband. She and Christopher discuss why she and her colleagues decided it was time to ask lawmakers for the change after years of depending on large ISPs who weren\u2019t living up to promises to expand broadband in rural areas.\n\nChristopher and Senator Davis discuss some of the details of the bill and address the amendments that changed a broad piece of legislation to a targeted law that allows local communities to apply for federal grant funding. She explains some of the reasons for the amendments and how those changes fit into the vision she and her colleagues in the legislature have for the future of Arkansas.\n\nRead more about SB 150.\n\nWe want your feedback and suggestions for the show-please e-mail us or leave a comment below.\n\nThis show is 21 minutes long and can be played on this page or via iTunes or the tool of your choice using this feed.
