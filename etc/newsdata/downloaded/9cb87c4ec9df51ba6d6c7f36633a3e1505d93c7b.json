Keane said Solskjaer deserved the chance to bring in new players.\n\n\u201cThey have given him the job. Support him in a couple of transfer windows. Are there more tough days ahead? You bet your life, but you need to stick with it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was a lack of quality from both teams tonight. Their lack of goals, the lack of opportunities they\u2019re creating.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer said that despite some encouraging individual displays, United\u2019s results were a concern.\n\n\u201cThere are many things we look at and many things that give me loads of confidence,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can talk about performances but it\u2019s the results that matter. You can talk about the results, I can talk about the six out of seven games good performances,\u201d he said.", "description": "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane lent his support to the club\u2019s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after their latest disappointing result left them with a point from a 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal on Monday.
