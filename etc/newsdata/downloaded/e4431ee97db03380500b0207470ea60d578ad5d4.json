This is the last stop towards the Calvert Street Bridge, and it\u2019s essential for that mode of travel.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, the bicycling advocates have called for installing bike lanes along Woodley Place, a residential road that runs parallel to Connecticut Avenue.\n\nBut Bobbie Carroll and other residents say that adding bike lanes would not be safer because Woodley Place already is a narrow street.\n\n\u201cThe bike wants to do what the car was doing, zip through two blocks without having to go on Connecticut. The problem is that the streets are too narrow, especially at night,\u201d Ms. Carroll said.\n\nA key reason for the conflict lies in the District\u2019s outlying areas, said Colin Browne of the Washington Area Bicyclist Association, a nonprofit not affiliated with Ward 3 Bicycle Advocates.\n\nMr. Browne said those areas \u201care based a bit more suburban and people are more car-dependent in those places, so when you talk about reallocating public space to make space dependent in those places, you see a lot of opposition.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s Vision Zero initiative, which aims to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety throughout the city, has given the green light to creating bike lanes along Woodley Place.\n\nBut after the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) issued its notice of intent for Woodley Place, a conflict erupted that both sides later described as hostile.\n\nLee Brian Reba, the advisory neighborhood commissioner for Ward 3C01, said residents don\u2019t object to safety measures but have expressed doubts about the bike lane plan.\n\n\u201cThe bike advocates have painted us as NIMBYs,\u201d said Mr. Reba, using the acronym for \u201cnot in my back yard.\u201d \u201cAs a commissioner and District resident and cyclist, it\u2019s my duty to exercise skepticism when it comes to vehicular, cycling and pedestrian safety. There have been too many incidents on Woodley Place not to have caution.\u201d\n\nTo prove his point, he recently led three DDOT officials on a walk-through of the neighborhood and pointed out cars making three-point turns in the intersection. Mr. Reba said the area\u2019s infrastructure should be repaired before officials even think about installing bike lanes.\n\nResidents also objected to a lack of information from DDOT about what infrastructure problems the bike lanes would correct and examples of how bike lanes have eased traffic elsewhere. They said there isn\u2019t enough space on Woodley Place to accommodate everyone.\n\n\u201cWe fear this would be a slippery slope toward ultimately losing the parking,\u201d said the Rev. Jadon Hartsuff of All Souls Episcopal Church on nearby Cathedral Avenue. \u201cThis is worrisome for us because we truly rely on the street parking in a neighborhood that is already overwhelmed by weekend [National] Zoo visitors.\u201d\n\nDespite residents\u2019 concerns, the Ward 3C ANC failed to prevent the bike lanes from being built.\n\nThe District has built about 80 miles of bike lanes since 2000 and plans to install over 130 more miles of lanes by 2040.\n\nWith officials ready to build four miles of bike lanes and planning, designing or seeking public input on 18 more miles, conflicts between bicyclists and residents are likely to grow.\n\nAdditionally, the number of bicyclists in the District has tripled since 2005, which increases the likelihood of accidents if the bike lanes are not protected.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to build out the network, the problem gets a little harder, and oftentimes the problem requires changes to parking and changes to travel lanes, and we work through those,\u201d said Jim Sebastian, associate director of planning and sustainability at DDOT. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be disagreement about improving or changes to the neighborhoods. Our goal is to get in early and often to try to explain the goal to the city and increase access in all modes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we want is for safe infrastructure,\u201d said Brett Young, a member of Ward 3 Bicycle Advocates. \u201cIf a car hits you at 40 mph, you have a 50/50 chance of being dead. If a bike hits you, you get a bruise.\u201d\n\nDDOT spokeswoman Lauren Stephens said the number of serious injuries to cyclists has been trending downward since the start of 2017 but cycling deaths have increased slightly. From January 2017 to June 10, six bicycling deaths have been recorded in the District.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
