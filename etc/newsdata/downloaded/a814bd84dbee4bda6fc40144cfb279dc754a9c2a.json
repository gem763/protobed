Even the font\u2019s creator cringed.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nAttorney John Dowd, here seen in New York in April 2011, used the font Comic Sans this week in a letter to members of a House committee, drawing jokes and criticism. Dowd responded by saying: \"I love the font. It is easy on the eye.\" (Richard Drew/AP)\n\nComic Sans was created for a talking cartoon dog named Rover. But in the 25 years since its debut, the much-maligned, comic-book-inspired font has made its way into a Vatican-produced photo album of the pope, an NBA owner\u2019s screed about LeBron James and, now, a formal response to the impeachment inquiry surrounding President Trump.\n\nAttorney John Dowd used the font this week in a letter informing House committee members that his clients \u2014 two Rudolph W. Giuliani associates \u2014 would not be submitting to their demands. On social media, the letter\u2019s contents were nearly overshadowed by the font it was drafted in. Dowd\u2019s choice of Comic Sans became a Twitter moment. At least one observer joked that the attorney should be disbarred.\n\nHere's the letter (yes it's Comic Sans) indicating that Rudy Giuliani's associates will not be appearing or providing documents this week.\n\n\n\nAttorney John Dowd (Trump's former lawyer) argues the timeframe is too short and info could be attorney-client privileged. pic.twitter.com/3ytCecrPHv \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) October 7, 2019\n\nIn France, the man behind Comic Sans got a Google alert about the kerfuffle. Vincent Connare designed the flippant font for a long-forgotten operating system, Microsoft Bob, that was intended to provide a user-friendly interface for Microsoft 95. Looking at \u201cRover,\u201d who guided users through speech bubbles, Connare had the realization that led to Comic Sans: \u201cDogs don\u2019t talk in Times New Roman!\u201d\n\nBut do lawyers? Connare, who describes his creation both as \u201cmy one-hit wonder\u201d and \u201cthe best joke I ever told,\u201d didn\u2019t think so. He found Dowd\u2019s use of Comic Sans \u201cvery funny,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday. Ironically enough, he thought Times New Roman was required for legal filings. (In fact, some courts distribute lists of acceptable fonts. Comic Sans is usually not one of them.)\n\n\u201cHe chose what he liked,\u201d Connare surmised of Dowd. \u201cOr he maybe consciously chose it to p--- them off or something.\u201d\n\nThe former, actually. In response to a Washington Post inquiry, Dowd said in an email \u2014 typed out in Comic Sans \u2014 that he loves the font.\n\n\u201cI am laughing,\u201d wrote Dowd, a former Trump attorney who chose the same typeface for a letter to former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. \u201cFolks don\u2019t have enough to do. I love the font. It is easy on the eye. In 30 years of use, NO ONE has ever questioned it even in the most serious matters.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmail from John Dowd\n\nThis is the kind of thing that makes Holly Combs shudder. Since 1999, the Indianapolis graphic designer has made it her mission to eradicate inappropriate use of Comic Sans \u2014 think funeral programs, mental health literature or police bulletins. She and her husband, Dave, also a designer, called their movement \u201cBan Comic Sans\u201d and even wrote an infamous manifesto declaring that the typeface conveys \u201csilliness, childish naivete, irreverence.\u201d\n\nSome, like Dowd, love the typeface. Others see it as harmless and say it\u2019s elitist to fret about it. There are also those who argue it is easier for people with dyslexia to read. Dave Combs now encourages people to use Comic Sans if they like it. His wife does not agree. She argues the style of Comic Sans makes its use disrespectful in serious situations.\n\n\u201cI feel like this man dressed up in a clown costume,\u201d she said of Dowd.\n\nConnare is proud of Comic Sans in that it accomplished what it was supposed to: \u201cThis program that I saw screamed out for a childish, cartoonish font,\u201d he said. Yet he himself has used it only once \u2014 in a letter complaining about his broadband service. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve anything better, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI intentionally did it because I thought, well, maybe \u2014 if they even notice \u2014 maybe that will get their attention. So in a way, it was a joke.\u201d\n\nHe prefers a more traditional look, like Baskerville, and said Comic Sans is not advisable for an impeachment inquiry response because it\u2019s \u201ctoo casual.\u201d\n\nBut after mulling it over, Combs said that the font was fitting in a way.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a talking dog,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in our world right now \u2014 there would be no other typeface to put it in.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nRudolph W.
