Lindsey Graham (R-SC) feuded with CBS anchor Margaret Brennan over the veracity of the Trump whistleblower complaint. The complainant alleges that President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to interfere in the 2020 presidential election by investigating former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe phone transcript, however, \"does not match\" the complaint, Graham said. It is \"hearsay,\" he noted. And it should be treated as such.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a parking ticket based on hearsay,\u201d Graham argued. \u201cThe whistleblower didn\u2019t hear the phone call.\u201d\n\nThe real scandal, Graham continued, was Joe Biden and Hunter Biden's ties to Ukraine. Hunter was sitting on the board of a Ukrainian gas company being investigated by the inspector general, and the former vice president reportedly asked for that IG to be fired. Graham \"loves\" Joe Biden, but he said something is fishy.\n\n.@LindseyGrahamSC suggests appointing a special investigator to look into Joe Biden\u2019s role in the firing of Ukranian Prosecutor Viktor Shokin. https://t.co/68SQluCwQL pic.twitter.com/ZUPIqQZtRr \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) September 29, 2019\n\nBrennan took the complaint a little more seriously, noting how the complainant mentions he or she heard about the phone call from multiple White House officials.\n\n\"I'm laying out the facts here,\" Brennan said.\n\nTo which Graham replied, \"No - no you're not.\"\n\nThe frustrated senator told Brennan she had her opinion, and he had his. And in his opinion, the complaint, and the Democrats' impeachment inquiry is a \"sham.\" He dared Brennan to answer his long list of questions.\n\n\"I can't believe we're talking about impeaching the president based on an accusation based on hearsay,\" he said. \"Who is this whistleblower? What bias do they have? Why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story? The transcript does not match the complaint. What's going on here? Why did they change the rules about a whistleblower you can use hearsay when you could not just weeks before the complaint?\"\n\nHe asked a few more questions on his Twitter page Monday, reiterating what a joke the Democrats' impeachment campaign is.", "description": ".09/30/2019 20:10:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/6f9b8167-6265-45a3-94c0-89048a6fe959.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
