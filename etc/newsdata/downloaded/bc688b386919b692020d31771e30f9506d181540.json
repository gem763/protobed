For a small handful of Americans\u2014many of them among the most senior officials in the U.S. government\u2014that day conjures memories of a bunker underneath the White House, built for the Cold War but never used until that Tuesday morning 18 years ago.\n\nWhat had begun as an odd incident, with the crash of American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m., quickly escalated 17 minutes later when United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower. As the world realized the country was under attack, Vice President Dick Cheney and senior White House aides were rushed to that bunker under the White House, known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC). There, underneath the executive mansion\u2019s north lawn, they tried to figure out how many more hijacked planes were in the air. They knew of at least one: United Flight 93.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis excerpt from the forthcoming book The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11 (Avid Reader Press) is based on contemporaneous transcripts of 911 calls and cockpit voice recorders from September 11, as well as both archival primary source interviews with key participants\u2014conducted as early as 2002\u2014and supplemental original interviews by the author, as recent as this spring, including the first-ever interview with the Navy officer who ultimately asked Cheney for authority to shoot down hijacked airliners. Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nGary Walters, chief usher, White House: It was a little bit before 9 a.m. when Mrs. Bush came downstairs\u2014I met her at the elevator. As we were walking out, I remember we were talking about Christmas decorations.\n\nLaura Bush, first lady: My Secret Service agent, the head of my detail, Ron Sprinkle, leaned over to me as I got into the car and said, \u201cA plane has hit the World Trade Center.\u201d\n\nCondoleezza Rice, national security adviser, White House: I thought, Well, that\u2019s a strange accident. I called the president. We talked about how odd it was. Then I went down for my staff meeting.\n\nMatthew Waxman, National Security Council, White House: I had started about six weeks earlier as Condi Rice\u2019s executive assistant. At about 9:00 o\u2019clock, we would have a daily Situation Room meeting for the national ecurity adviser and all the senior directors. It was during that meeting that the second plane hit.\n\nMary Matalin, aide to Vice President Dick Cheney: I was with the Vice President when the second plane hit, and we knew instantly that this was not an accident.\n\nCondoleezza Rice: It was the moment that changed everything.\n\nMatthew Waxman: We went into full crisis response mode.\n\nMary Matalin: We went right into work mode. While we were in his office making calls to New York, making calls to the president, making calls wherever they needed to be made, the Secret Service barged into his office.\n\nDick Cheney, vice president: Radar caught sight of an airliner heading toward the White House at 500 miles an hour.\n\nLewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney: We learn that a plane is five miles out and has dropped below 500 feet and can\u2019t be found; it\u2019s missing. You look at your watch and think, Hmmm, five miles out, 500 miles an hour. Tick, tick, tick.\n\nDick Cheney: My Secret Service agent said, \u201cSir, we have to leave now.\u201d He grabbed me and propelled me out of my office, down the hall and into the underground shelter in the White House.\n\nMary Matalin: My jaw dropped and the jaws of my colleagues dropped because we had never seen anything like that.\n\nCondoleezza Rice: The Secret Service came in and they said, \u201cYou have got to go to the bunker.\u201d I remember being driven along, almost propelled along. We had no idea where it was safe and where it wasn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t think the bunker of the White House was safe at that point.\n\nDick Cheney: They practice this\u2014you move, whether you want to be moved or not, you\u2019re going.\n\nGary Walters: The Secret Service officers started yelling, \u201cGet out, get out, everybody get out of the White House grounds.\u201d I remember early on, the chaos. People running, screaming. Fear was in my mind.\n\nChristine Limerick, housekeeper, White House: The look on the faces of the Secret Service agents who were told that they had to stay\u2014I will never forget that because we had at least the opportunity to flee.\n\nIan Rifield, special agent, U.S. Secret Service: We were fairly confident that plane was going to hit us. The supervisor in the [Secret Service\u2019s] Joint Operations Center basically said, \u201cAnybody who survives the impact, we\u2019ll go to an alternate center, and we\u2019ll continue.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a joke.\n\nDick Cheney: A few moments later, I found myself in a fortified White House command post somewhere down below.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes, deputy director, Presidential Contingency Programs, White House: Vice President Cheney arrived in the bunker, along with his wife. The PEOC is not a single chamber; there are three or four rooms. The operations chamber is where my watch team was fielding phone calls. Then there\u2019s the conference room area where Mr. Cheney and Condi Rice were\u2014that\u2019s the space that had the TV monitors, telephones, and whatever else.\n\nMary Matalin: It took a while for everybody to actually get to that area. It hadn\u2019t been used for its intended purpose\u2014which was to be a bomb shelter\u2014since its inception.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes: Shortly thereafter, I looked around and there was Condi Rice, there was Karen Hughes, there was Mary Matalin, there was [Transportation Secretary] Norm Mineta. Mr. Mineta put up on one of the TV monitors a feed of where every airplane across the entire nation was. We looked at that thing\u2014there must have been thousands of little airplane symbols on it.\n\nMary Matalin: The vice president was squarely seated in the center. It was emotional, but it was really work, work, work. We were trying to locate first and foremost all the planes. Identify the planes. Ground all the planes.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes: That first hour was mass confusion because there was so much erroneous information. It was hard to tell what was fact and what wasn\u2019t. We couldn\u2019t confirm much of this stuff, so we had to take it on face value until proven otherwise.\n\nAt 9:59 a.m., those inside the bunker\u2014as well as millions more glued to TV screens around the country\u2014watched in horror as the South Tower fell.\n\nMary Matalin: We saw the building collapse.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes, Deputy Director, Presidential Contingency Programs, White House: There was a deafening silence, and a lot of gasping and \u201cOh my god\u201d and that kind of thing.\n\nMary Matalin: Disbelief.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes: There are four or five very large, 55-inch television screens in the PEOC. We would put the different news stations\u2014ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC\u2014on those monitors. I remember Cheney being as flabbergasted as the rest of us were sitting there watching on these monitors. Back in those days, a 55-inch TV monitor was a really big TV. It was almost bigger than life as the towers collapsed.\n\nDick Cheney: In the years since, I\u2019ve heard speculation that I\u2019m a different man after 9/11. I wouldn\u2019t say that. But I\u2019ll freely admit that watching a coordinated, devastating attack on our country from an underground bunker at the White House can affect how you view your responsibilities.\n\nMary Matalin: We had to go right back to work.\n\nRichard Clarke, counterterrorism advisor, White House: Many of us thought that we might not leave the White House alive.\n\nMatthew Waxman: One of the things we were all very conscious of down in the PEOC was that the White House Situation Room was staffed with our close colleagues and friends who were staying in those spots despite a clear danger. The Situation Room, which is only half-a-floor below ground, was abuzz with activity, from people who wouldn\u2019t normally be posted there, but who felt duty bound to stay there to help manage the crisis. Especially early in the day, there was a palpable sense that close friends and colleagues might be in some significant danger.\n\nIan Rifield: There was a sense of frustration too, because we were sitting there. Everybody wanted to fight back. We\u2019re trained to go to the problem, and we were sitting there. There was a lot of tension in that regard. You wanted to do something to protect the complex and the office of the president even better than we were, but we were doing the best we could with what we had.\n\nCondoleezza Rice: Norm Mineta, the transportation secretary, was tracking tail numbers of the aircraft on a yellow pad. He was calling out. \u201cWhat happened to 671? What happened to 123?\u201d He was trying to make sense of what was going on.\n\nNic Calio, director of legislative affairs, White House: Norm Mineta was sitting in front of these TV screens that had all these planes on them. It was pretty remarkable when you saw the number of planes in the air.\n\nCondoleezza Rice: My first thought was, Get a message out to the world that the United States of America has not been decapitated. These pictures must have been terrifying. It must have seemed liked the United States of America was coming apart. My test was to keep my head about me and to make certain that people around the world didn\u2019t panic.\n\nNic Calio: The activity was so high and things were happening so quickly, at least for me, there wasn\u2019t any time to be afraid.\n\nMatthew Waxman: There was this stark contrast between the chaotic information bombardment about what was happening around Washington, around the country\u2014some of it accurate, some of it inaccurate\u2014and the calm and careful deliberation of a lot of the senior decision-makers.\n\nNic Calio: The vivid memory I have was we were in this cocoon\u2014receiving and sending all this information, at the same time not knowing where our families were. It was probably midafternoon before we were able to try and contact our families. That was worrisome. I didn\u2019t know where my kids were. There was an overriding uncertainty about what was going on, what would actually happen, and what would have to follow.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes: The president was safer aboard Air Force One than trying to come home, and Mr. Cheney\u2014without question\u2014he was in charge. He was in charge of the space and we would bring him information.\n\nTo defend the nation from the surprise attack, government officials inside the PEOC called upon the military and the small number of fighter aircraft ready at bases across the Northeast, coordinated through the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) headquarters in Rome, New York.\n\nCol. Bob Marr, commander, NEADS: We were in foreign territory; we are used to protecting the shores, way out overseas. Our processes and procedures weren\u2019t designed for this.\n\nMajor General Larry Arnold, commander, 1st Air Force, Continental United States North American Aerospace Defense Command, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida: We can\u2019t see the aircraft. We don\u2019t know where it is because we don\u2019t have any radars pointing into the U.S. Anything in the United States was considered friendly by definition.\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney, F-16 pilot, D.C. Air National Guard, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland: Our chain of command didn\u2019t go up to NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] ], didn\u2019t go up through the First Air Force, which oversaw operations in the United States. They had no method to be able to reach down\u2014or even be able to know that the D.C. National Guard was there and available. There were no rules of engagement. I hadn\u2019t even thought about what that kind of mission might be like on American soil.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes: I was running liaison between the ops guys who had Pentagon officials on the phone and the conference room [in the PEOC] where the principals were. The Pentagon thought there was another hijacked airplane, and they were asking for permission to shoot down an identified hijacked commercial aircraft. I asked the vice president that question and he answered it in the affirmative. I asked again to be sure. \u201cSir, I am confirming that you have given permission?\u201d For me, being a military member and an aviator\u2014understanding the absolute depth of what that question was and what that answer was\u2014I wanted to make sure that there was no mistake whatsoever about what was being asked. Without hesitation, in the affirmative, he said any confirmed hijacked airplane may be engaged and shot down.\n\nCol. Matthew Klimow, executive assistant to the Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard Myers, Pentagon: No one had ever contemplated the need to shoot down a civilian airliner.\n\nMajor General Larry Arnold: I told Rick Findley in Colorado Springs [at NORAD\u2019s headquarters], \u201cRick, we have to have permission. We may have to shoot down this aircraft that is coming toward Washington, D.C. We need presidential authority.\u201d\n\nMajor Dan Caine, F-16 pilot, D.C. Air National Guard, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland: I handed our wing commander the phone to talk to the high levels of government to get the rules of engagement.\n\nDick Cheney: It had to be done. Once the plane became hijacked\u2014even if it had a load of passengers on board who, obviously, weren\u2019t part of any hijacking attempt\u2014having seen what had happened in New York and the Pentagon, you really didn\u2019t have any choice. It wasn\u2019t a close call.\n\nMatthew Waxman: That really grabs you by the collar, when you hear the vice president giving the order to shoot down an unidentified aircraft flying toward the national capital. That stands out as one of the most frightening moments of the day, partly because it highlighted the sense of continuing danger. There was also the realization of the enormous dilemmas that faced decision-makers at that moment with very little time and imperfect information.\n\nCommander Anthony Barnes: I knew, without a doubt in my mind, that that was a historical precedent\u2014that never before had we given permission to shoot down a commercial airliner. I got back on the phone\u2014it was a general of some sort in the Pentagon\u2014and on that secure line I was talking on, made sure that he understood that I had posed the question to the National Authority [the vice president] and the answer was in the affirmative. We made sure that we did not stutter or stumble because the emotion at that point was very, very high. Fortunately we didn\u2019t have to use that authority.\n\nJosh Bolten, deputy chief of staff, White House: Vice President Cheney was very steady, very calm. He clearly had been through crises before and did not appear to be in shock like many of us.\n\nDick Cheney: As bad as the events of 9/11 were, some of us had practiced exercises for far more dangerous and difficult circumstances\u2014an all-out Soviet nuclear attack on the United States. That helped\u2014that training kicked in that morning.\n\nEric Edelman, principal deputy assistant to the vice president for national security affairs, White House: He was a calming influence on people because you\u2019d sort of be embarrassed to, in front of him, betray any sense of, Oh my God.\n\nCondoleezza Rice: There were times that day that it felt like an out-of-body experience. But you keep functioning, even though you don\u2019t really believe it\u2019s happening.\n\nWith the order given from Vice President Cheney, the military scrambled to find fighters it could bring into the fight\u2014even if that meant launching them unarmed, on a kamikaze mission to crash their own fighters into hijacked airliners. The scrambled fighter jets would never make contact with Flight 93\u2014the passengers and crew aboard United Flight 93 passengers were planning, at the same time, to take the plane down themselves.\n\nCol. Matthew Klimow: It was a very painful discussion for all of us. We didn\u2019t want the burden of shooting down the airliner to be on the shoulders of a single fighter pilot, but we also didn\u2019t want to have that pilot go all the way up the chain of command to get permission to shoot. It was decided the pilots should do their best to try to wave the airplane off, and if it\u2019s clear the airplane is headed into a heavily populated area, the authority to shoot can be given to a regional commander.\n\n\n\nTHE CALL\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney, F-16 pilot, D.C. Air National Guard: This sounds counterintuitive, but when the magnitude of the situation hit me, I really lost all emotion. It was really much more focused on, What are the things I need to do to enable us to protect our capital? What are the things I need to do to facilitate us getting airborne?\n\nBrigadier General David Wherley, commander, D.C. Air National Guard, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland: My translation of the rules to Sass was, \u201cYou have weapons-free flight-lead control.\u201d I said, \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m asking you to do?\u201d [Sasseville and Penney] both said yes. I told them to be careful.\n\nLt. Col. Marc Sasseville, F-16 pilot, U.S. Air Force: As we\u2019re going out to the jets, Lucky and I had a quick conversation about what it is that we were going to do and how we were basically going to do the unthinkable if we had to.\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney: We would be ramming the aircraft. We didn\u2019t have [missiles] on board to shoot the airplane down. As we were putting on our flight gear in the life support shop, Sass looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019ll ram the cockpit.\u201d I made the decision I would take the tail off the aircraft.\n\nLt. Col. Marc Sasseville: We didn\u2019t have a whole lot of options.\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney: I had never been trained to scramble [mobilize] the aircraft. It would typically take about 20 minutes to start the jets, get the avionics systems going, go through all the preflight checks to make sure the systems were operating properly, program the computers in the aircraft. That\u2019s not even including the time to look at the forms, do the walk-around of the airplane, and whatnot. We usually planned about half-an-hour to 40 minutes from the time you walked out the door to the time that you actually took off.\n\nCol. George Degnon, vice commander, 113th Wing, Andrews Air Force Base: We did everything humanly possible to get the aircraft in the air.\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney: I just got my radios up, and I was yelling at my crew chief, \u201cPull the chocks!\u201d He pulled the chocks and I push my throttle. The crew chief was still running under the tail so that my gear would come up\u2014there are safety pins that are all in the airplane\u2014and so they were pulling all those safety pins as I was taxiing to go do an immediate take-off. I didn\u2019t even have an inertia navigation unit. I didn\u2019t have any of that set up. It was lucky it was a clear, blue day because we didn\u2019t have all the avionics. They were not yet awake when we took off.\n\nLt. Col. Marc Sasseville: I was thinking, Wow, we\u2019re in a little trouble here.\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney: Sass and I fully expected to intercept Flight 93 and take it down.\n\nLt. Col. Marc Sasseville: I was going into this moral or ethical justification of the needs of the many versus the needs of the few.\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney: I genuinely believed that was going to be the last time I took off. If we did it right, this would be it.\n\nMajor General Larry Arnold, commander of the 1st Air Force, the Continental United States North American Aerospace Defense Command, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida: Bob Marr quotes me as saying that I told him that we would \u201ctake lives in the air to save lives on the ground.\u201d\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney, F-16 pilot, D.C. Air National Guard: Seeing the Pentagon was surreal. It was totally surreal to see this billowing black smoke. We didn\u2019t get high. We were at about 3,000 feet. We never got above 3,000 feet, at least on that first sweep out.\n\nLt. Col. Marc Sasseville: There was all this smoke in my cockpit. It made me nauseous to be honest with you\u2014not from an Ugh, this stinks, it was more from an Oh my God, we\u2019ve been hit on our own soil and we\u2019ve been hit big. I couldn\u2019t believe they had gotten through and they managed to pull off this attack.\n\nLt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney: The real heroes are the passengers on Flight 93 who were willing to sacrifice themselves.\n\nLt. Col. Marc Sasseville: They made the decision we didn\u2019t have to make.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAboard Flight 93\n\nIn the final minutes of United Airlines Flight 93, passengers and crew used the plane\u2019s in-seat Airfones to call friends, family and airline operators to communicate about the hijacking. A few minutes before 10 a.m., United Flight 93 passenger Edward Felt, a 41-year-old, married father of two who was traveling as part of his job as a computer engineer for BEA Systems, called 911 from the plane and reached emergency dispatcher John Shaw in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. It was the first tip to Pennsylvania authorities that there was trouble in the skies overhead. This is an abridged transcript of their call.\n\nEd Felt: \u201cHijacking in pro\u2014\u201c\n\nJohn Shaw: \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \u201cHey somebody\u2019s reporting a\u2014\u201c\n\nFelt: \u201cHijacking in progress.\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cSir, I\u2019m losing you, where are you?\u201d\n\nFelt: \u201cUnited Flight 93.\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cWait a minute, wait, United flight. United Flight 93.\u201d\n\nFelt: \u201cHijacking in progress!\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cOK, where are you? Where are you?\u201d\n\nFelt: \u201cI\u2019m in the bathroom, United Flight 93.\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cOK, where are you?\u201d\n\nFelt: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\nFelt: \u201cI don\u2019t know where the plane is.\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cWhere did you take off?\u201d\n\nFelt: \u201cNewark to San Francisco.\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cI got it, OK, stay on the phone with me sir.\u201d\n\nFelt: \u201cI\u2019m trying to ... [unintelligible] at the bathroom. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nShaw: \u201cHey somebody get the FAA, Newark to San Francisco and they got a hijacking in progress. OK, yeah. Get somebody from the airport on the line. This is a hijacking in progress.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAlice Ann Hoglan, mother of Mark Bingham, passenger, United Flight 93: The uniqueness of Flight 93 is that it was in the air longer than the other flights. People on board were able to find out about the fate of the other three flights and mount an effort to thwart the hijackers, even if they weren\u2019t able to save their own lives.\n\nDeena Burnett, wife of Tom Burnett, passenger, United Flight 93: It was silent, and I could feel my heart racing. [On the phone with me,] Tom said, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting until we\u2019re over a rural area. We\u2019re going to take back the airplane.\u201d I became very frightened and I begged, \u201cNo, no, Tom. Just sit down, be still, be quiet, and don\u2019t draw attention to yourself.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, Deena. If they\u2019re going to crash this plane, we\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d\n\nI asked, \u201cWhat about the authorities?\u201d He said, \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for the authorities. I don\u2019t know what they can do anyway. It\u2019s up to us.\u201d He said, \u201cI think we can do it.\u201d Neither of us said anything for a few seconds. Then I said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do? What can I do?\u201d \u201cPray, Deena, just pray.\u201d \u201cI am praying. I love you.\u201d Tom said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re going to do something,\u201d then he hung up. He never called back.\n\nOne passenger, Todd Beamer, reached a Verizon Airfone operator, Lisa Jefferson.\n\nLisa Jefferson: As that plane took a dive, I could hear the commotion in the background. I heard the flight attendant screaming. People hollering out, \u201cOh, my God! Jesus, help us!\u201d He asked me, if he didn\u2019t make it, would I please call his wife? I told him I would, but I asked him if would he like me to connect him to her right then. He said, no, he didn\u2019t want to upset her. She was expecting their third child in January, and he knew she was home alone. He gave me his home phone number.\n\nLyzbeth Glick, wife of Jeremy Glick, passenger, United Flight 93: Jeremy said there were three other guys as big as him, and they were going to jump on the hijacker with the bomb and try to take back the plane. He asked if I thought that was a good idea. We debated a little bit. He said that they were going to take a vote and asked what did I think he should do. I said, \u201cYou need to do it.\u201d He\u2019s a very strong man, and large\u20146 feet, 220. He was a national judo champion, so he was really well-equipped with self-defense. He was joking, \u201cI have my butter knife from breakfast.\u201d Despite everything, he was able to be a little bit humorous. Then he said, \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to put the phone down. I\u2019ll be right back. I love you.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAOS ON BOARD\n\nPhilip Bradshaw, husband of Sandra Bradshaw, flight attendant, United Flight 93: We talked about how much we loved each other and our children. Then she said: \u201cEveryone is running to first class, I\u2019ve got to go. Bye.\u201d Those were the last words I heard from her.\n\nLisa Jefferson: Todd turned to someone else and he said, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d I could hear them; they responded. He said, \u201cOK. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d That was the last thing I heard.\n\n\n\n***\n\nTranscript from the United Airlines Flight 93 cockpit voice recorder\n\n9:57 a.m.\n\nVoice in Arabic: Is there something?\n\nVoice in Arabic: A fight?\n\nVoice in Arabic: Yeah?\n\nVoice in Arabic: Let\u2019s go guys.
