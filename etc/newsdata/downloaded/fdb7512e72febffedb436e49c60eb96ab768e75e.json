Forecasts for a steamy September have pushed prices higher, though.\n\nAnalysts suspect that buying by speculators hoping to cover up errant bets that prices would fall are sending prices even higher than weather forecasts warrant.\n\nNatural gas futures for October delivery closed at $2.58 per million British thermal units on Tuesday, up 25% from a three-year low of $2.07 that was reached on Aug. 5.\n\n\u201cAn extension of summer helps, but it\u2019s not game changing like what we\u2019re seeing going on in the market,\u201d said Jordan McNiven, an analyst with Houston investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.\n\nExports and consumption by power plants have run at or near records this summer. The glutted market has needed every bit of added demand to sop up production that notched a fresh high in May and wasn\u2019t far off another in June.\n\nIn late May, bets that gas prices would tumble began to outnumber wagers that they would rise, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Hedge funds and other money managers had been bullish on balance since the beginning of 2018, but they correctly forecast this summer\u2019s unseasonable price slump and short bets snowballed.\n\nBy the second week of August, natural gas prices had reached three-year lows and speculators had built up their biggest net short position since 2008, when the economic recession and advances in drilling technology sent prices on a plunge.\n\nOn Aug. 13 speculators held 367,504 contracts short, which was 235,515 more than they held in long bets that prices would rise. One contract counts for 10,000 million British thermal units, or about $26,000 worth of gas at the prevailing price.\n\nAs gas prices climbed over the last month on warmer forecasts and expectations that drillers were dialing back, speculators have reduced their short bets by about a quarter. Yet as of Sept. 3, short positions still outnumbered long bets by better than two to one, according to the CFTC data.\n\n\u201cThe shorts get scared or beyond their risk-management parameters,\u201d Mr. McNiven said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a bit of the short trade unwind.\u201d\n\nEnergy trading consultants Ritterbusch & Associates told clients on Monday that the firm shifted away from bearish positioning, saying \u201cwe are currently in no rush to re-establish a negative trading bias.\u201d\n\nA similar situation may be playing out in shares of natural gas producers.\n\nOn Monday several natural gas producers rose more than 10% as gas prices climbed 3.6%. Among the day\u2019s big gainers were Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Gulfport Energy Corp. , which rose 20% and 18%, respectively. Appalachian gas producers Range Resources Corp. , EQT Corp. and Antero Resources Corp. each added more than 9%.\n\nThose companies have been among the most heavily shorted energy stocks this summer as gas prices swooned, according to data compiled by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc.\n\nBetting on the direction of natural gas prices often means predicting the weather, which has made natural gas trading both wildly lucrative and devastating.\n\nSummer\u2019s segue into autumn is dangerous as investors try to time the end of air-conditioning season. It was around this time of year in 2006 when Amaranth Advisors lost $5 billion on wrong-way natural gas bets and had to shut down in one of the biggest hedge fund collapses in history.\n\nRather than the milder weather that is expected this time of year, Commodity Weather Group LLC predicts unusual heat in the central and eastern parts of the country to close out summer, with Mid-Atlantic temperatures in the 90s and 100 degrees plus in parts of Texas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in this hotter-than-normal pattern for the next couple weeks,\u201d said Jason Setree, a meteorologist with the Bethesda, Md. forecaster.\n\nWrite to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com", "description": "Hedge funds and other money managers in August built up a big bet that natural gas prices would decline\u2014their most bearish position in the futures market in over a decade\u2014only to have prices shoot up 25%.", "authors": ["Ryan Dezember", "Ryan.Dezember Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105615/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
