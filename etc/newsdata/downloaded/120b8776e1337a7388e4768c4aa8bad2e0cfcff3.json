The latest beta versions of Spotify include this support, and The Verge has been able to test playing songs via Siri on the latest iOS 13.1 update. It\u2019s part of new capabilities that Apple has introduced with iOS 13, and it means music apps like Spotify are now on equal footing with Apple Music for requests via Siri, apart from the irritating \u201con Spotify\u201d addition.\n\nWhile this new feature lets you request Spotify songs with Siri on an iPhone, it does not currently work on an Apple Watch as Apple\u2019s wearable doesn\u2019t have a full dedicated Spotify app. Instead, the app is simply a controller for playing songs on other Spotify-enabled devices. Siri simply responds with \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that on your Apple Watch\u201d when you try. We haven\u2019t been able to test whether the HomePod now works with Spotify as a result, but it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nSpotify is finally getting Siri support with iOS 13. You can ask Siri to play songs, albums, and playlists. Here\u2019s how it works: https://t.co/Oc7LegT5yr pic.twitter.com/6F97fbjLtX \u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) September 27, 2019\n\nHowever, the Spotify and Siri integration works well on Apple\u2019s AirPods, allowing you to say \u201cHey Siri\u201d and request albums, playlists, or songs to play on Spotify\u2019s service. One thing that doesn\u2019t work well is trying to play podcasts with Siri, as Spotify attempts to search for music instead of dedicated podcasts.\n\nSpotify is currently testing this new functionality, and it will likely debut in the coming weeks in the main app. We got an early look at Spotify on the Apple Watch last year in beta, and the feature launched less than two weeks later. Spotify isn\u2019t commenting directly on its plans.\n\n\u201cAt Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,\u201d says a Spotify spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. \u201cSome of those tests end up paving the path for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We aren\u2019t going to comment on specific tests at this time\n\nUpdate, September 27th 12PM ET: Article updated with comment from Spotify.", "description": "Spotify is finally getting Siri support.
