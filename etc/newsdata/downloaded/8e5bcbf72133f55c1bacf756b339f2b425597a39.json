After being rushed by ambulance to a hospital for a cardiac catheterization, then taking only four days off, he feels \u201cgood\u201d now, but added, after these first two games: \u201cWho needs a stress test? I\u2019m getting one every day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are the latest examples of how the Nats \u2014 horrid as tortured, exaggerated fiction but fabulous as daily baseball reality \u2014 continue to cause foreheads to be smacked by palms and lungs turned raw by roars.\n\nIn their first two wins against St. Louis, the Nats have allowed just three singles and a double on a misplayed line drive. That\u2019s all led to one sad run for the Cardinals.\n\nS\u00e1nchez and Scherzer are now the only teammates to take no-hitters into the sixth inning or deeper in back-to-back postseason games. Previously, since postseasons began in 1903, only one pair of teammates had ever taken no-hitters as far as five innings in back-to-back postseason games \u2014 yes, S\u00e1nchez and Scherzer, six years ago in Games 1 and 2 of the American League Championship Series when they were on the Detroit Tigers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI stand out there in right field and enjoy the masterpieces they are painting,\u201d said Adam Eaton, whose two-run double smashed down the first base line gave the Nats a 3-0 lead in the eighth for gasping room.\n\nThe center fielder who started the Nats\u2019 Game 2 scoring with a solo homer off loser Adam Wainwright was Michael A. Taylor, who has hit .300 in these playoffs. Only six weeks ago, he was buried deep in the minors and almost forgotten. Now, with Victor Robles not quite back from a strained hamstring, Taylor keeps contributing \u2014 as with a dazzling diving catch to clinch the Nats\u2019 shock upset of the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the NL Division Series.\n\nWith the Nats, the gobsmacking improbabilities never stop. The pitcher who got the save in Game 2 was not even present for Game 1. On Friday, reliever Daniel Hudson was the first player to take paternity leave during the postseason. Wife and infant daughter are doing well, thanks. So is Huddy, who didn\u2019t get back to this city until his plane landed just seven hours before he watched \u2014 bleary-eyed \u2014 as the Cardinals\u2019 Marcell Ozuna popped up his final fastball.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats barely celebrated, just jogged on the field happily like it was another day on which they had successfully \u201cgone 1-0\u201d \u2014 the team\u2019s trivial sounding yet athletically profound mantra. So many peculiar, comical or just brain-freezing events happen to this team on a regular basis that any other approach \u2014 any attempt to take in more than one day\u2019s events \u2014 might lead to mass cranial explosions.\n\nNow, the Nationals come home for a Game 3 the likes of which baseball fans in Washington have not seen since the 1933 Senators reached the World Series.\n\n\u201cOur park has been absolutely legit,\u201d Eaton said of the volume at Nationals Park in the postseason. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to go home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe place has been incredible \u2014 they go nutty from the first pitch,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be even crazier after what we\u2019ve done so far. Should be a fun time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats were widely left for dead \u2014 except in their clubhouse \u2014 when they were 19-31 on May 23, with the fourth-worst record in the majors at the time, and 10 games behind the mighty Philadelphia Phillies of Bryce Harper in the NL East. Since then, they have gone 80-40 and outscored their foes by a staggering 188 runs. And only in this NLCS with both Sean Doolittle and Hudson effective have they finally put together a semblance of a back end of their bullpen. Meanwhile, the Phillies fired their manager this week.\n\nThe strategic turning point of Game 2 was a blunder by Cardinals Manager Mike Shildt. With two Nats on base and two outs in the eighth of a 1-0 game, Eaton was due to face the 38-year-old Wainwright, who\u2019d already thrown 92 pitches and gallantly struck out 11, albeit aided by the ridiculous shadows imposed on hitters by Major League Baseball\u2019s made-for-TV late-afternoon starting times.\n\nAD\n\nBefore Saturday, Eaton was 5-for-11 with a double and homer off Wainwright. Because of the shadows in Game 2, his 0-for-3 on the day meant little. The move was to call for lefty Andrew Miller. Shildt stuck with Wainwright, saying that he still had his command. But Eaton worked a full count, then lashed a two-run double past a diving Paul Goldschmidt.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy last at-bat was the first time I saw the ball the whole way [to home plate] \u2014 kind of unfortunate conditions for a really big game,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cI looked for a curveball. Sat on it. Got it. Hit it really hard.\u201d\n\nWhy choose the curveball?\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018It\u2019ll be a fastball.\u2019 Then I realized that I had been wrong on every pitch of the whole game when I tried to figure out what Wainwright and [catcher Yadier] Molina would do. So, like George Costanza (the character in \u201cSeinfeld\u201d), I figured, \u2018I\u2019ll go the other way \u2014 curveball.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nYears from now, when we reread the stories or watch the old documentaries made about the 2019 Nats, we really aren\u2019t going to believe what we are seeing at this very moment.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a team that, from being 12 games under .500, made the greatest push from such a depth since the 1914 Boston Braves to reach the postseason with 93 wins. Once in the playoffs, they trailed 3-1 in the eighth inning of elimination games against the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 Josh Hader and the Dodgers\u2019 Clayton Kershaw. Both times they rallied to win. The back-to-back home runs by Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto in Game 5 against the Dodgers \u2014 on consecutive pitches to tie the game at 3 \u2014 are the signature moment for this resilient team.\n\nAD\n\nSo far.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll show up on Monday, ready to go, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cOur pitching has been outstanding. . . . We feel very strongly about our chances. . . . We have Jack Flaherty, really the best guy in baseball in the second half, indisputably, going for us in Game 3.\u201d\n\nFlaherty is exceptional and, indeed, owned a 0.91 ERA after the all-star break. But his foe at Nationals Park on Monday will be a stern customer, too \u2014 Stephen Strasburg, who is on an exception run in his past 11 starts.\n\nThe next Nationals game will be for high stakes and in an atmosphere that is unlike anything of which all but a very few living Washingtonians have even the faintest memory. The team that insisted that it would \u201cStay in the Fight\u201d has now landed two huge haymakers to the Cardinals. The two more blows that are required will not be easy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStay focused. Go 1-0,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019ve done it all year.\u201d\n\nNot reason to stop now.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:", "description": "Two wins from the World Series, Washington returns to Nationals Park.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/k6RUGcMBMYhFTyGHWk-Px-UCEdg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XSBRTSXNJEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
