Because it can be hard to fully grasp what infertility involves unless you\u2019ve dealt with it personally, many people believe that it\u2019s all about the end game, a baby \u2014 that if you could just get to that prize, the pain of infertility would fade away. But infertility is bigger than babies. I say this often, because I want people to get it. It truly is. It can affect our physical and mental health in insidious \u2014 and sometimes enduring \u2014 ways.\n\nI founded The Broken Brown Egg, an online community and awareness organization, in 2009, because I wanted to support women of color who are battling infertility. In the years since, hundreds of women have reached out to me to share their stories \u2014 about their struggles to conceive, and about the feelings of isolation and stress they often face, too. Research has shown that women dealing with infertility have depression and anxiety levels similar to those with cancer, H.I.V. and heart disease, and \u2014 through my advocacy work as well as my personal experiences \u2014 I have become intimately familiar with infertility\u2019s psychological toll. Yet it took me a long time to acknowledge that infertility can be a form of trauma. It didn\u2019t feel worthy of the term. I mean, infertility isn\u2019t life-threatening, right?\n\nSome researchers argue that the definition of trauma should be expanded to include the psychological and emotional response to not only physical threats, but threats to deeply held expectations of life. According to Allyson Bradow, a psychologist who wrote a paper on infertility, people affected by infertility must adjust to a major shift in life expectations while being exposed to constant reminders of their condition, through questions from family members, medical treatments or interactions with pregnant women.\n\n\u201cPsychologists must understand that infertility is a trauma, and often a complex trauma,\u201d Bradow writes. \u201cWhile anxiety, depression, and grief and loss are all a part of the psychological impact of infertility, there is much more to the experience which is defined by the individual.\u201d\n\nInfertility changes how you see yourself and the world. Somewhere along the journey, many of us stop feeling as though it is something that is happening to us, but instead begin to believe that it is a part of who we are. You become used to living in a constant state of fluctuating despair and hope. And this doesn\u2019t turn off when and if you get pregnant. It doesn\u2019t turn off when you hear or see the heartbeat. My son is 3. I\u2019m still trying to turn it off.", "description": "Even when it ends with a healthy baby, a long struggle to conceive may exact a brutal toll.", "authors": ["Regina Townsend"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/multimedia/23-parenting-newsletter-infertility/23-parenting-newsletter-infertility-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
