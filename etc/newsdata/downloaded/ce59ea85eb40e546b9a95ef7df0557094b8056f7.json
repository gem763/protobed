Join the conversation below.\n\nThe meeting is set to coincide with the expiration Tuesday evening of a 120-hour truce that Turkey agreed to with Vice President Mike Pence last week. Mr. Erdogan agreed to halt the military offensive he launched in northeastern Syria on Oct. 9 in exchange for a U.S. commitment to help drive Kurdish fighters away from the Turkish border.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters said they have withdrawn from several towns and villages coveted by the Turks, but both sides accused the other of violating the cease-fire with sporadic attacks.\n\n\u201cIf the promises made by the U.S. to our country are not kept, we will resume our offensive from where we left it, and this time with great determination,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told reporters in Ankara before taking off for Sochi.\n\nIn addition to repelling Kurdish fighters, Ankara wants control over territories in northeastern Syria to relocate half of the nearly four million Syrian refugees living in Turkey. But the agreement with Washington covers only about a quarter of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s proposed 300-mile-long safe zone.\n\nMoscow\u2019s commitment to securing the remaining three quarters will be essential because the Russian-backed army of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last week struck an agreement to work with the Kurdish militia. Taking advantage of the void created by departing U.S. troops, Mr. Assad\u2019s soldiers have been deployed in several border towns held by the Kurds.\n\nAfter striking an agreement with the U.S. to pause a military offensive against Kurdish forces, Turkey is closer to something it has long sought: A slice of territory in northern Syria that Ankara wants to use as a \u201csafe zone.\u201d Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, Syrian military units moved into several new villages in northeast Syria as part of the agreement with the Kurds, according to Syrian government media. The seven villages lie along the strategic M4 highway, which extends across northern Syria, connecting the city of Hasakah with Aleppo.\n\nThe discussion between Messrs. Putin and Erdogan will likely be \u201clengthy and complex,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told reporters Tuesday. \u201cNegotiations will be very difficult, it\u2019s obvious.\u201d\n\nTurkish authorities have played down the prospect of a direct conflict with Damascus. But Turkey relied on Syrian rebels who have fought against the Assad regime as part of its ground incursion in Kurdish-held territories, raising concerns of violent clashes if they come in contact with Syrian regime troops.\n\nTuesday\u2019s meeting is emblematic of a new Middle East order in which U.S. influence is waning and that of Moscow is expanding.\n\nAreas of control, Oct. 21 Syrian government Turkish army Kurdish forces and allies Turkish army/Syrian opposition forces Opposition forces Iraqi government 50 miles turkey 50 km Duhok Kobani iran Sheikhan Hasakah Mosul Erbil Aleppo Raqqa Deir Ezzour iraq Euphrates R.

But any Russian support for Turkey\u2019s safe-zone plan is likely to upset the Assad regime\u2019s other backer, Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who will be present in Sochi for a three-way meeting with Messrs. Erodgan and Putin, has condemned Turkey\u2019s assault against the Syrian Kurds.\n\nMr. Putin has warned he would only accommodate a limited Turkish incursion in Syria. But Russia is facing its own challenges in Syria, setting the stage for a potential deal between Turkey and Russia that delineate the limits of each other\u2019s influence in the country.\n\nIn April, Syrian government troops and Russian combat jets launched an offensive to reclaim the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib, the last bastion held by rebels fighting the Assad regime, some of whom are supported by Ankara. One of Russia\u2019s objectives is to protect the nearby Khmeimim air base because it has been within firing range from the rebel stronghold.\n\nThe confrontation sent half a million people fleeing, forcing them to seek refuge in makeshift camps along the Turkish border. All summer, Mr. Erdogan sounded the alarm over the humanitarian toll in Idlib, and Russia agreed to suspend airstrikes in late August.\n\nBut now that Turkey needs the Kremlin\u2019s help for its safe-zone project, Turkish officials and analysts said the price to pay will be to let Russia and the Assad regime complete their offensive in Idlib.\n\nHighlighting Idlib\u2019s place in the high-stakes negotiations between Russia and Turkey over Syria, Syrian state media showed Mr. Assad touring the front lines separating government troops from rebel groups in the province. \u201cErdogan is a robber\u2026He has robbed the factories, wheat and oil, and today he is robbing the land,\u201d he said in a statement carried by state media.\n\n\u201cMr. Putin will definitely put pressure on Mr. Erdogan regarding Idlib,\u201d said Pavel Baev, a professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo and a former analyst at the Soviet Ministry of Defense.\n\nAsked last week if such an arrangement would be under consideration in Sochi, Mr. Erdogan said he was satisfied with Russia\u2019s adherence to its August cease-fire pledge. Idlib \u201cisn\u2019t on my agenda but we can remind each other about this,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.\n\nMr. Putin has said the offensive in Idlib was legitimate because the province had fallen under the control of radical groups.\n\nAs the cease-fire drew to an end, the flow of Syrians into Iraq increased sharply, according to Tom Peyre-Costa, a spokesman for the Norwegian Refugee Council. Within the past 24 hours, 1,736 refugees arrived, he said Tuesday, bringing the total to 7,135 since the start of the Turkish offensive.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters patrol in the border town of Tal Abyad, Syria, on Oct. 21. Photo: khalil ashawi/Reuters\n\nA large convoy of U.S. military vehicles crossed into Iraq from Syria on Monday but Iraqi authorities said they hadn\u2019t granted Washington permission to keep the troops in Iraq.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper on Sunday had said all of the roughly 1,000 troops ordered to leave northeastern Syrian would move to western Iraq and conduct operations against Islamic State from there. On Tuesday, he said he would discuss the matter with his Iraqi counterpart, adding: \u201cThe end state is to bring the troops home, which is what the president wants to do.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already has around 5,000 troops in Iraq and any increase would likely be seized upon by pro-Iranian factions that have agitated against a continued American presence. The Iraqi government has struggled to balance the interests of Washington and Tehran as tensions between them increase.\n\n\u2014Raja Abdulrahim in Istanbul, Nazih Osseiran in Beirut, Nancy Youssef in Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, and Isabel Coles and Sune Engel Rasmussen in Erbil, Iraq, contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to David Gauthier-Villars at David.Gauthier-Villars@wsj.com and Ann M.
