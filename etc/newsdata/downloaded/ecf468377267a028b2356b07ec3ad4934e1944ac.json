MakeItGrateful.com\n\nLet's be real, one of the best cookies is the snickerdoodle. Add some pumpkin spice and snickerdoodles reach a whole new level of fall flavor.\n\nBefore we get started on this recipe, let\u2019s talk spices.\n\nPUMPKIN SPICE TIPS\n\nOne of the best things to do before you get into your holiday baking is to check the expiration dates of all your spices, baking soda, baking powder, etc. A surefire way for a cookie disaster is working with the same thing you bought too many Thanksgivings ago. While old spices won\u2019t hurt you, they lose their punch, and in a recipe like this, you want that fresh flavor.\n\nSince pumpkin spice mix is generally used for the holidays and not much else, it makes an easy gift idea. If you want the freshest blend possible, we recommend grinding your pumpkin spice mix yourself.\n\nPUMPKIN SPICE SNICKERDOODLES RECIPE\n\nPumpkin spice snickerdoodle cookies on a rack.

Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need for this recipe.\n\nSnickerdoodle dough\n\n1-1/2 cups sugar\n\n1 cup butter, softened\n\n2 eggs\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n3/4 cup bread flour\n\n2 teaspoons cream of tartar\n\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n\n1/4 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt\n\nPumpkin spice dough\n\n3 tablespoons maple syrup\n\n1/4 cup bread flour\n\n2 tablespoons pumpkin spice\n\nPumpkin spice\n\n3 tablespoons ground cinnamon\n\n2 teaspoons ground ginger\n\n2 teaspoons ground nutmeg\n\n1-1/2 teaspoons ground cloves\n\nExterior dusting\n\n1/3 cup sugar\n\n1/2 teaspoon pumpkin spice\n\nIngredients for pumpkin spice snickerdoodle cookies.

Add dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, salt) and mix at low speed until well combined.\n\nI like using the paddle attachment if you\u2019re using a stand mixer, as it\u2019s an easy way to make sure the dough isn\u2019t overworked.\n\nSplit dough in half, placing half in a bowl and set aside. In the half remaining in your mixer, add maple syrup, additional flour and pumpkin spice mix. If you really love pumpkin spice, you can also search for pumpkin spice-flavored maple syrup to give it an extra kick! Mix on low until just combined.\n\nMore: Candy corn cinnamon rolls: Get the recipe\n\nChill both doughs for 30 minutes. Once chilled, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

If the balls sit too long with the sugar mixture, it just gets absorbed into the cookie dough itself.\n\nBake at 400 for 8 minutes, rotating pan halfway through for even baking. Cool on pan for 2 minutes before transferring to cooling rack.\n\nPumpkin spice snickerdoodle cookies on a cooling rack right out of the oven.
