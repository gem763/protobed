Cuddly sponsorship turns into a heap of bad publicity. I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s why they are dismayed.\n\nThere are two types of these things. The first is pretty simple. It\u2019s advertising, no more no less. Splashing your corporate name across a football club\u2019s jerseys or backing a popular TV show are examples of this. It gets your brand seen by people you hope will then buy your product or subscribe to your service. Everyone more or less knows the rules of the game. All well and good.\n\nThe second is more insidious. It\u2019s where companies support beneficial activities with the aim not just of selling stuff but also of showing off what good and caring corporate citizens they are.\n\nThese can include cultural events, such as those put on by the RSC. Less commercially valuable sporting activities also fit into this category, say, backing a disadvantaged athlete who\u2019ll appear in a video for you and mention you during interviews. Putting money into para-sports is another good example.\n\nBP is doing an awful lot of the second type right now. Can you guess why?\n\nYou\u2019ll see its name prominently displayed on the British Museum\u2019s exhibition on the myth and reality of Troy. Except it\u2019s actually called \u201cThe BP Exhibition\u201d.\n\nTwitter\u2019s algorithm seems to have picked up that I\u2019m disabled, like sport, write about disability. So it has been bombarding me with ads touting BP\u2019s support for the Paralympics and of para-athletes. \u201cIgniting the energy with Tatyana McFadden,\u201d says one. Oh god. Spare me. Just spare me.\n\nFor the uninitiated, McFadden is an American wheelchair racer of singular talent and with so many gold medals she probably has to rent space out at Fort Knox just to keep them safe.\n\nBut \u201cinspirational\u201d videos such as the one she\u2019s shot for BP are getting really, really old.\n\nMore to the point, who is it that you think will suffer the most from the planet turning into a cooker? Clue: it won\u2019t be the wealthy white guys who run oil companies.\n\nWhat must really have dismayed BP is that the kids protesting its involvement with the RSC saw its attempts at corporate greenwashing for what they are and refused to endorse them.\n\nThe RSC should be commended for its willingness to listen to their protest. It\u2019s rare, and welcome, for this to happen.\n\nOrganisations like the RSC need money. Sponsorships help defray the cost of productions, which are expensive and risky. They also serve to keep ticket prices at a more or less manageable level so they are affordable by people other than the likes of Boris Johnson and his elite old Etonian pals. BP\u2019s helped fund discounted prices for those aged 16-25. It is to be hoped that someone else will now step in.\n\nRegardless, other organisations should consider following the RSC\u2019s lead. Not to put too fine a point on it, they run a risk by accepting money from the wrong sort of company. When the likes of BP are involved, it is a zero sum game. If the corporate sponsor\u2019s reputation is being polished, then theirs is being tarnished.\n\nI understand the commercial realities they face, and the fact that corporate sponsorships aren\u2019t easy to find.\n\nBut there are businesses out there with deep pockets, and less noxious products.", "description": "\u201cTo BP, or not to BP?
