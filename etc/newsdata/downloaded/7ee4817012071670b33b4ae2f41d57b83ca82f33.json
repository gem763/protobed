Ahead of the Russia-Africa summit, which kicked off on Tuesday in Sochi, top African officials visited a local nature reserve and got their hands dirty.\n\nThe country-wide sapling-planting drive, designed to help the Russian region hit by massive forest fires earlier this year, was launched on September 14 and is set to last until the end of October. The goal of the quest is to plant 30 million new trees \u2013 and it was reached by Russia\u2019s African guests.\n\nThe 30-millionth tree (a fir tree) was planted by the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.\n\nActing President of Mauritius Barlen Vyapoory, Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo, and other high-ranking African officials also took up their spades and got shoveling.\n\nWhile the goal of 30 million has already been achieved, the tree-planting quest will continue, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources said.\n\nThe two-day Russia-Africa summit, co-chaired by Russia and Egypt, has brought together countries from all across Africa. The majority of them are represented by top-level officials \u2013 presidents and heads of governments.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t all light-hearted gardening. Addressing the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is seeking to boost fair cooperation with all African nations. Trade between Russia and African countries is on the rise, growing by 17 percent in 2018 to $20 billion, and Moscow now seeks to double it within the next five years.\n\nAlso on rt.com First ever Russia-Africa Forum gives developing nations a wider \u2013 and better \u2013 choice in future economic partnerships\n\nLike this story?
