(Photo: Universal)\n\nSony teases that \u201cfamous people\u201d want to do a remake of The Princess Bride. No, Rihanna has not been cast as Batman\u2019s Poison Ivy, but she\u2019d like to be. Plus, production wraps on The Invisible Man, what to expect when The Flash and Van Helsing return and another batch of footage from Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. Spoilers now!\n\nHalloween Kills/Halloween Ends\n\nSpeaking with Collider, Jamie Lee Curtis revealed David Gordon Green\u2019s plan for Halloween Kills is to bring back \u201call those [surviving] characters\u201d from the first movie \u201cwhose lives were affected by what happened in 1978\", while Halloween Ends will be \u201ca very powerful examination of violence.\u201d\n\nWhat I love that David and [writer] Danny [McBride] and company did is they connected the dots for forty years, now they\u2019re going back to really unpack the first movie, bringing back all those characters whose lives were affected by what happened in 1978.\n\nThe last movie is the sort of cultural phenomenon of violence, that\u2019s what the third movie ultimately is, a very powerful examination of violence\u2026It comes at it from a slightly different way. You\u2019ll like it\u2026 If you believe in me at all, I promise you what David Gordon Green has come up with as a way to complete this trilogy is sensational.\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nSpeaking of Curtis, In a recent interview with Variety, Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra ominously stated, \u201cvery famous people whose names I won\u2019t use... want to redo The Princess Bride\u201d, provoking the ire of the actress, among others:\n\nOh really? Well, I married the six fingered man, obviously why we have stayed together for 35 years and there is only ONE The Princess Bride and it\u2019s William Goldman and @robreiner\u2019s. \u201cLife is pain highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something!\u201d https://t.co/hv33UIZKN3 \u2014 Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) September 17, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one. https://t.co/5N8Q3P2e5G \u2014 Cary Elwes (@Cary_Elwes) September 18, 2019\n\nFor the record, not us.\n\nLove the movie\u2014 it still holds up as the greatest meta story put to film.\n\nAlso, the way you know it\u2019s not us is the use of the phrase \u201cvery famous\u201d https://t.co/LeGzVp6FRO \u2014 Chris Miller (@chrizmillr) September 18, 2019\n\nThe Batman\n\nIn light of a recent Instagram post, Rhianna confirmed to ET she has not been cast as Poison Ivy in Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman, but would naturally like to be considered for the role should the character make an appearance.\n\nOh that?! Really? That!? Are you serious? No that has nothing to do with Poison Ivy. That [post] has to do a lot with Batman [because] I have separate obsessions. I have bigger obsession with Poison Ivy, I\u2019m just being honest. And yeah, I died my hair red because of Uma Thurman in the original. You know what, they didn\u2019t call me yet. But if they did, I would love to go in and try out because Poison Ivy is one of my obsessions in life. I did it for Halloween one year, I mean come on!\n\nJoker\n\nSpeaking of Batman villains, Bloody-Disgusting has a new IMAX poster for Joker.\n\nThe Invisible Man\n\nProduction has officially wrapped on Leigh Whannell\u2019s The Invsible Man \u2014 too bad we can\u2019t see it!

Reverse Flash), and the surprise arrival from the future of Barry and Iris\u2019s daughter Nora West-Allen, (a.k.a. XS). The stakes were higher than ever during the season 5 finale, which culminated in Barry and Iris losing their daughter after only just getting to know her.
