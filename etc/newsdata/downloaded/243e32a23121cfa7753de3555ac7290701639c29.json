And then think about this: What if Mr. Vespucci\u2019s first name was Leonardo? We\u2019d be living in the United States of . . . Lenny. Makes you shudder to think about that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we\u2019re not in that place, are we? Heck no: We are living in the United States of America, a place where there are unalienable rights, paid for in blood and sacrifice, a place where there is free and unfettered speech. Except . . .\n\n. . . that there is a quite liberal court, specifically in the District of Columbia (there\u2019s that Cristoforo name again!) that is the setting for a true threat to the First Amendment right, under the guise of a case known as Mann v. National Review. It is our hope that the United States Supreme Court will take our case \u2014 which is also your case \u2014 from the D.C. court in order to turn back this serious threat to our right \u2013 which is also your right \u2013 to free speech, a threat that, as Rich Lowry made clear in a recent appeal, has just got to be bankrolled by the Left.\n\nHow terribly un-American, that. So is this: Mann v. National Review has cost a ton. So isn\u2019t this: NR is determined to fight, if need be to our last drop of ink. It will cost a ton or two more before we prevail \u2014 you prevail \u2014 in this legal assault. As we make clear in our 2019 Fall Webathon appeal, atop the list of our various needs is that of bearing this critical case\u2019s legal costs (there is a lot our insurer does not pay). We are confident that people such as you will think this merits your selfless support. So please do be a conservative paisan (you don\u2019t need to be from the Old Country to be tight with us!). As we cap the first week of this endeavor, over 900 NRO readers have already stepped up (or Mann-ed up, as some of us prefer) and offered aid material, and thoughts bracing. We share a few, as is our custom, that have come since our last update, and that hearken to this particular day:\n\nChristopher from Sacramento spots us $100 and has us thinking that Bartlett\u2019s may be calling: \u201cMy new saying: Conservatives are now the custodians of genuine Liberalism (capital \u2018L\u2019).\u201d True paisan. Thanks so much.\n\nChris chips in with $20 and applauds: \u201cBravo NR. I\u2019m based in Europe. Would love to visit your offices next time through NY. Cheers.\u201d Do that. By the way, will you be arriving via the Nina, the Pinta, or the Santa Maria?\n\nChristine from Charlottesville sends along $100 and a simple request: \u201cPlease hang in.\u201d Hanging!\n\nChris from Antelope, CA throws a President Grant into the collection basket and states starkly: \u201cEquity does equity.\u201d Hmmmm. But thank you so much.\n\nFolks, do not take the lightness offered here as symbolic of our approach to this matter: Mann v. National Review, if the Penn State professor prevails, will be a torpedo in the hull of the Constitution. That\u2019s why it is your fight too. So, especially if you\u2019ve never done so before, please contribute. Donate here. If you prefer to send a check, make one payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d and mail it to National Review, ATTN: 2019 Fall Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1701, New York, NY 10036. Know that our appreciation will be real and lasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Happy Columbus Day!", "description": "We are living in the United States of America, a place where there are unalienable rights, paid for in blood and sacrifice.", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
