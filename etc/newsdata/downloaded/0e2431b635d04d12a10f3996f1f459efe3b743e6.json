Sister Barbara Kane, a member of the Dominican Sisters of Peace, was one of those faith leaders involved with the release of the letters which were published in the Columbus Free Press on Tuesday.\n\nShe told ABC News that the point of releasing the letters was to ensure that the mayor, leadership within the police department and the public had the opportunity to read the letters.\n\nKane said that she feels the letters show the police department \u201cis not a healthy environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue for us as clergy, if it\u2019s bad on the inside, it\u2019s going to flow out into the neighborhoods and that\u2019s a great concern, obviously,\u201d Kane said.\n\n\u201cI can truthfully say that the unfairness in punishment, along with favoritism, racism, and nepotism are at an all-time high here at CPD,\" wrote an anonymous writer in one letter who claims that they have been working for the department for 30 years.\n\nPaul Vernon/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cWhat's even sadder is that it's gotten so blatant around here that some of the people know they can do whatever and know for certain their punishment will be next to nothing and then smile about it. Punishment for misconduct should be the same for all. Not to mention the bullying that goes on for those who stand up for themselves or apply for certain jobs,\u201d that author wrote.\n\nThe Columbus Police Department did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nMayor Andrew Ginther released a statement following the disclosure of the letters, saying that the city \u201ctakes all allegations of discrimination seriously.\u201d\n\nThe review process over the past year, both in assessing the state of the department and in the search for a new chief of police, has involved the work of consultants and panels and calls for input from the public. Ginther highlighted one such public meeting that was held Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cStrong, positive relationships among police officers and residents are imperative for Columbus as we move forward. I am encouraged by the public\u2019s involvement to date and look forward to implementing change,\u201d Ginther said in the statement.", "description": "More than a dozen letters from police officers and employees allege that there is rampant racism and mistreatment inside the Columbus Police Department.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/columbus-ohio-police-dept-file-gty-jef-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
