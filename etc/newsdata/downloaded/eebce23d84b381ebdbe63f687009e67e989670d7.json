I\u2019m so happy to be going to Australia and New Zealand: the two places that had one mass shooting and fixed the problem immediately. \u2014 Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) September 28, 2019\n\nBut she didn\u2019t stop there, in a recent interview with TimeOut, Handler praised the NZ Prime Minister on her swift handling of the issue of gun control following the Christchurch shootings.\n\n\u201cObviously [Ardern\u2019s] famous everywhere for what happened after the shooting there,\u201d she told TimeOut. \u201cShe\u2019s setting a good example. It\u2019s too bad we don\u2019t have anybody in our country who\u2019s willing to listen to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems like the most common sense reaction any leader would have to a shooting,\u201d she says of Ardern\u2019s reaction, and the similar reaction by John Howard following the events of Port Arthur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so senseless, our gun laws in America. I mean, it\u2019s just so depressing every single day here. That\u2019s another reason why I like travelling and getting the hell out of this country.\u201d\n\nHandler, who is a vocal Trump critic, also went on The Project as part of the press for her stand-up show, where she was asked about the US President. However, she promptly deflected the questions, claiming she wants a break from the president while she\u2019s out of the country.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about being out of the country is that\u2026 any time I have an opportunity to leave the country while Donald Trump is the president, I take it,\u201d she told Waleed Aly. \u201cSo if I can take a break from reading his tweets, I enjoy that immensely because I used to have a problem,\u201d she said, adding that she was \u201cnot familiar with the last 24 hours and I want to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nDespite having a pretty controversial past, Chelsea\u2019s latest Netflix documentary Hello Privilege, It\u2019s Me, Chelsea explores the comedian coming to terms with her own white privilege and how this affects American culture and her own life.\n\nShe\u2019s also currently touring her latest stand-up show around Australia and New Zealand this month.
