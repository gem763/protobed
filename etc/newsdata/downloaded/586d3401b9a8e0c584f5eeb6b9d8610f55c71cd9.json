This is the 6.43am express that will take me from London to the Scottish capital. But not just yet.\n\nFirst, I must step aboard the adjacent train, on platform 7, to field test some research. It contradicts the oft-quoted notion that it is cheaper to fly between key British cities rather than to travel by rail.\n\nWell-publicised stories over the years have even suggested that flying via a third country is cheaper than going by rail from London to key cities in Scotland and northern England.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nCommon to these accounts is a failure to compare like with like: typically comparing a book-ahead air fare with an on-the-day rail ticket. So at noon on Monday I checked a dozen options by train and plane between London and Edinburgh for travel early the following morning.\n\nBritish Airways led the field with a \u00a349 one-way hop from Gatwick (leaving aside, as those plane vs train stories tend to do, the cost of reaching the airport).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That Virgin Trains express preparing for the West Coast route at platform 6 from Euston came in at a painful \u00a3143.\n\nHappily, I found a train trick to undercut the BA air fare. It involves getting out of bed a quarter-hour earlier to board the London Northwestern train from platform 7 to Crewe, which leaves punctually at 6.28am.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the punitive peak-hour fares on the inter-city train operator, my advance ticket cost just \u00a39 for 160 miles.\n\nWhile the Crewe Cheapie (not its official name) uses rolling stock described dismissively as \u201couter suburban\u201d, the train is quite comfortable enough for a two-hour journey \u2013 and swift enough, at 110mph, to compete on the fast track of the West Coast Main Line.\n\nAt Rugby we stand aside so that a 125mph Virgin Trains express to Manchester can race through without stopping. The service then follows in its slipstream, ferrying commuters and schoolchildren along the Trent Valley line.\n\nAn \u201canytime\u201d ticket for the 20-minute hop between Nuneaton and Lichfield costs the same as I paid for the whole London-Crewe journey.\n\nMeanwhile the 6.43am Virgin Trains service to Edinburgh plods through the West Midlands, with pauses at Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. So it arrives in Crewe more than half-an-hour behind my train. This is where a \u00a333 advance ticket for the remaining 240 miles to Edinburgh takes effect \u2013 undercutting BA by \u00a37, and getting me from city centre to city centre into the bargain.\n\nThe station staff at Crewe keep us on our toes, mind, by suddenly switching the platform from 11 to 6.\n\nThe Edinburgh train, and its timetable, has come adrift somewhere around Birmingham (haven\u2019t we all?). By Preston it is running 10 minutes late and being chased by a following Virgin Trains service to Glasgow.\n\nAt Lancaster the platform signs increased the confusion by announcing that the Edinburgh train was, actually, bound for Glasgow Central.\n\nOnce into Scotland, the scenery steps up a gear and so does the train, climbing effortlessly to Beattock Summit \u2013 more than 1,000ft above sea level \u2013 and the austere beauty of the Borders.\n\nThe descent to Edinburgh brings glimpses of the three Firth of Forth crossings (don\u2019t try saying that after a Virgin Trains croissant). The driver has made up time to arrive at Waverley \u2013 the only railway station named after a novel \u2013 right on schedule.\n\nYes, it has taken almost six hours to reach the Virgin berth on platform 10. And I expected to have been beaten to it by the 8am LNER express from London King\u2019s Cross, due in two minutes earlier. But the East Coast train is delayed by 25 minutes \u2013 long enough to be annoying but not enough to get some \u201cdelay repay\u201d cash back.
