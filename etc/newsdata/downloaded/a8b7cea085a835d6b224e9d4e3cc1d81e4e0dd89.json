NewsBTC will lay out three.\n\nFirst, the world\u2019s institutions continue to push towards unorthodox monetary and fiscal policies \u2014 something that Kling says only increases the value proposition of Bitcoin. For instance, a bank in Denmark is now charging investors with over $111,100 in their bank accounts. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is effectively free to store, scarce, unconfiscatable, decentralized, non-sovereign, immutable, censorship-resistant, global, and public \u2014 characteristics that investors say make it a tantalizing play in uncertain times.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate has continued to mount higher, recently hitting an all-time high of 108 exahashes per second. As mining machines are illiquid and take a while to achieve a 0% ROI, the increase in the strength of the network implies that miners have long-term faith in BTC.\n\nAnd last but not least, Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. In a recent report, Munich-based financial institution Bayerische Landesbank revealed that the next block reward reduction for the leading cryptocurrency is likely to have an extremely positive effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAnalysts at the bank found that per their analysis of the correlation between a commodity\u2019s stock-to-flow (new yearly supply over above-ground supply of a commodity) ratio and its market capitalization, the next halving will give Bitcoin a fair valuation of $90,000 per coin, implying that \u201cthe forthcoming halving effect has hardly been priced into the current Bitcoin price of approximately USD 8,000.\u201d\n\nWhy Bitcoin Crashed\n\nAlthough Kling\u2019s medium to long-term outlook is rather lofty, he did take some time to breakdown why the Bitcoin price took a strong tumble over recent weeks.\n\nAnalysts have looked to a number of fundamentals events, namely the seemingly lackluster launch of Bakkt, to describe the Bitcoin breakdown. However, Kling looked to something else, this being the repo market, which is where banks can trade government securities for a short holding period.\n\nFor those unaware, the past few weeks have seen this market erupt, with overnight rates spiking as a result of what some say are \u201ccracks in the plumbing\u201d of fiat; the Federal Reserve has been pumping dozens of billions of dollars each day into this market to stabilize it. Kling argued that an event of this size, despite being not related to Bitcoin at all, created a ripple effect that recently began to hit the cryptocurrency market.\n\nKling\u2019s latest comment is reminiscent of a Twitter thread he published one week back, in which he made the same argument: a dollar shortage in global markets, which is a massive event on a macro scale, partially led to the precipitous drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "According to Ikigai's Travis Kling, Bitcoin bulls might not need to wait long for the leading cryptocurrency to establish a fresh all-time high.
