Menopause is defined as the changes a woman goes through just before and after she stops her periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally. Some women go through this time with few, if any, symptoms, around 60 percent experience symptoms resulting in behavioral changes and one in four will suffer severely. Common symptoms include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness leading to discomfort during sex, disrupted sleep, decreased sex drive, problems with memory and concentration and mood swings. Menopause happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51, according to the NHS.\n\nMenopause happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month.\n\nHowever, thousands of women each year choose to enter the menopause surgically, which can be temporary or permanent.\n\nGonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH) offer endometriosis patients relief.\n\nGnRH temporarily switch off the ovaries and stop oestrogen production, University College London Hospitals says.\n\nThe trust adds: 'This results in a temporary but reversible menopause. This tends to cause shrinkage of endometriosis, as the condition is oestrogen dependent.'\n\nMs Urquhart added: 'If the pain continues, I will consider a hysterectomy in the future even though it's not a cure.'\n\nWomen who have the life-changing procedure immediately enter a non-reversible menopause, if their ovaries are removed at the same time.\n\nMs Urquhart added: 'If the pain continues, I will consider a hysterectomy in the future even though it's not a cure' (pictured with Mr Eastwood)\n\nMs Urquhart's symptoms began when she was 12 - but she was dismissed by doctors and claims she was made to feel as though she was 'exaggerating'\n\nWHAT IS ENDOMETRIOSIS AND HOW IS IT DIAGNOSED? Endometriosis occurs when cells in the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Each month, these cells react in the same way as those in the womb; building up, breaking down and bleeding. Yet, the blood has no way to escape the body. Symptoms include pain, heavy periods and fatigue, as well as a higher risk of infertility, and bowel and bladder problems. Around 1.5million women in the UK are suffering from the disease. Its cause is unknown but may be genetic, related to problems with the immune system or exposure to chemicals. The only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis is by a laparoscopy - an operation in which a camera - a laparoscope - is inserted into the pelvis via a small cut near the navel. The surgeon uses the camera to see the pelvic organs and look for any signs of endometriosis. If endometriosis is diagnosed, the endometriosis may be treated or removed for further examination during the laparoscopy. Treatment focuses on pain relief and improving quality of life, which may include surgery or hormone treatment.

It is unclear if she has restarted her course.\n\nAround 1.5million women in the UK and 6.5million in the US are thought to suffer from endometriosis.\n\nIts cause is unknown but may be genetic, related to problems with the immune system or exposure to chemicals.\n\nMs Urquhart's symptoms began when she was 12 - but she was dismissed by doctors and claims she was made to feel as though she was 'exaggerating'.\n\nSome medics even claimed her pain was down to an STI, which left her feeling like she was 'going insane'.\n\nTest results would always come back negative and Ms Urquhart said it would cause her to become a hypochondriac.\n\nSince being diagnosed in her twenties, Ms Urquhart has had two operations to cut out remove some endometriosis tissue. It is unclear how much she has left.\n\nShe added: 'But as it took so long, they discovered the endometriosis had spread to my bowel, womb, ovaries and all over my pelvic wall.'\n\nMs Urquhart also claims she had blood-filled cysts in her ovaries that would at least once a month, which felt like someone was 'pouring acid' over her organs.", "description": "Chanelle Urquhart, a bartender who lives in Hull, has endometriosis, an agonising condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/10/20123080-0-image-a-15_1571907851304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
