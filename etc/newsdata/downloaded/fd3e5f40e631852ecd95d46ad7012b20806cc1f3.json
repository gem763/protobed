Because we got the scoop on how to look fresh off the runway, literally. Yesterday morning, Kate Spade presented their Spring Summer 2020 collection surrounded by nature. And despite being in the belly of a concrete jungle, the models had an effortless glow from head-to-toe. Of course, Kate Spade's Creative Director Nicola Glass was responsible for the clothes, but our favorite drugstore brand, Maybelline, alongside their Global Makeup Artist, Erin Parsons, were the masterminds behind the beauty looks, which we're recreating ASAP.\n\n\"She [Kate Spade brand] wanted natural, throw on your moisturizer [looks]. It's a story of warm tones. Some other shows will give you lots of makeup, but I love that these girls are fresh and gorgeous, and [that] reflects the clothes\", Parsons shared with Teen Vogue.\n\nAnd rightfully so, the three simple looks were indeed a breath of fresh air. Especially, if you've spent every day since Euphoria premiered experimenting with bright and bold color combinations. Sure, we all have a newfound love for pearls and adhesive rhinestones, but Kate Spade's subtle glamour made us enjoy the little things whilst rekindling our love for the old and new, (but more about that soon!) tried and true, Maybelline products.\n\nBesides some winged eyeliner looks worn by Debi Mazar's daughter, Evelina Maria Corcos, every look was based around the models' individual traits, who each seemed like they would throw on a bolder lip with their moisturizer and walk out the door as a Kate Spade girl. As Maybelline shared with Teen Vogue, the two main looks that served as the baseline for each individual were dubbed \"soft and smudgy\u201d, perfect for the modern woman seeking nature in an urban jungle.\n\nAs a true makeup junkie, you most likely have some of these products already. But if you don't then good news! You can recreate each look all for under $61. And what should you do with the money you save? Hold onto your coins and wait patiently for Maybelline's upcoming drops, Brow Fast Sculpt Gel Mascara and Cheek Heat, which made their debut in this collection. Trust us, you'll want to complete this look with these products once they hit the shelves in January.\n\nThat being said, below you can see which products are runway worthy and how to apply them:\n\nOriginally Appeared on Teen Vogue\n\n", "description": "Look fresh off the runway!", "authors": ["Bianca Nieves"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5QHsiZBGruU.HqstDDJSAQ--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xNjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/teen_vogue_128/82ac7d3fe18b2fa6106ca00da48a3fc4", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
