(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinions editor\n\nFormer defense secretary Jim Mattis stopped by NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday as part of the promotional tour for his new memoir. At stop after stop on this tour, Mattis has been asked to comment on whether he disagrees with the president on specific issues, and each time he has ducked. Sunday was no different, and his excuses for not commenting yet again held up poorly.\n\nThe first dodge came when host Chuck Todd asked Mattis if he was \u201cconcerned that, while the country speaks with one voice, on a governmental level, when it comes to Russia, that the political leader is not?\u201d Mattis dodged, \u201cI won\u2019t make political assessments right now.\u201d His excuse? \u201cRemember that the Defense Department stays outside of politics for a reason. There\u2019s a long-standing tradition, why you do not want the military to be engaged in politics.\u201d That\u2019s true \u2014 for active-duty military. There\u2019s just as much precedent for retired military personnel joining the political sphere, and even becoming president themselves. Besides, Mattis omits the fact that defense secretary is a political appointment. The moment he accepted that position, he entered the political sphere; he cannot now claim to be outside of politics.\n\nWorse yet, Mattis even admits that there are things he is deliberately withholding. When Todd observed to him \u201cthat you do have more to say. You just don\u2019t believe this period of time is appropriate,\u201d Mattis would only reply, \u201cWell, Chuck, I have a lot of faith in the American people. They know how to vote. They don\u2019t need military generals telling them that they think this political assessment is the one they should go with, or the other one is, that sort of thing, especially as corrosive as the political debate has grown in the country.\u201d\n\nAgain, the \u201cI\u2019m just a soldier\u201d excuse fails for the two reasons noted earlier. Beyond that, though it is good to know Mattis thinks highly of his fellow Americans, that\u2019s rather contradicted by his withholding valuable observations about the president\u2019s behavior behind closed doors. Instead, Mattis plays unnecessarily coy, as in this exchange:\n\nCHUCK TODD: Is America safer today because of this decision in Syria? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: That\u2019s a complex question. I would say, America\u2019s always safer when it builds the trust and a sense of reliability among our allies that we\u2019re reliable.\n\nConsidering that the troop withdrawal in Syria is a pretty clear case of betraying U.S.-allied Kurdish forces, the second sentence there makes clear what Mattis really thinks. Saying \u201cthat\u2019s a complex question\u201d just undercuts the force of the statement and essentially guts it of any value.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only cryptic observation from Mattis. Another more worrying one came later:\n\nGENERAL JAMES MATTIS: This would be the worst time, I think, for military people to step out like that. But also, the Constitution, I think, is a very hearty document. I\u2019ve got a love affair with the U.S. Constitution. I actually used to read it about once a year and always found something new in it. So I would \u2014 CHUCK TODD: I always carry one with me, right here \u2014 GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: And I admire that. CHUCK TODD: \u2014 all the time because you need it. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: I had a pocket version, myself. I didn\u2019t carry it all the time. But I carried it a lot of days. CHUCK TODD: I used to not carry it all the time. I need it more often, these days. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: We all need it today.\n\nSaying we all need the Constitution these days is a statement heavy with implication that something is gravely wrong with U.S. democracy. Yet Mattis won\u2019t tell us if that\u2019s actually the case or why he\u2019s suggesting that. It\u2019s about as helpful as a traffic sign saying \u201cwatch out!\u201d without telling you what to watch out for.\n\nTo be fair to Mattis, he is far from the only former Trump administration official who has remained unfortunately silent about the president. Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and former director of national intelligence Daniel Coats, among others, have all remained quiet even as rumors continue to circulate about their dim views of President Trump and/or his policies. Their silence helps no one. Now is the time for Mattis and others to speak out.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Mattis, McMaster and other ex-officials are MIA\n\nJennifer Rubin: It\u2019s time for these officials to come to the aid of their country\n\nAlexandra Petri: Jim Mattis\u2019s book is NOT about the president\n\nJennifer Rubin: Mattis risks normalizing Trump\n\nMax Boot: Mattis and Mueller won\u2019t denounce Trump.
