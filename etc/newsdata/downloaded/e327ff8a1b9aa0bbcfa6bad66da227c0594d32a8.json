Budgeting can feel like a chore for children so encourage them to take pride in their savings and make it fun.\n\nTeach them to associate money with work\n\nThey need to understand that money is earned, and that mom and dad\u2019s money is not their money.\n\nAgree on household responsibilities that they can take on in exchange for pocket money.\n\nThe sooner they understand that nothing is for mahala, the better. This is something that they will carry into their adult life.\n\nIncentivise them for saving\n\nA good way to do this is to set a savings goal together and when they reach their savings target, take them shopping and allow them to spoil themselves.\n\nThis is great way to teach them balance in life. It shows them that if they work hard for their money and if they are smart with their money, then they will also be able to enjoy their money.\n\nTo find out more, follow @uGogoOfficial on Twitter.\n\nCompiled for Parent24 by Lesley-Anne Johannes.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
