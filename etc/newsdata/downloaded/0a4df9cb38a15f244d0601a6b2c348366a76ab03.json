It also targeted children.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where products like e-cigarettes fall on the continuum of tobacco product risk, the law is clear that, before marketing tobacco products for reduced risk, companies must demonstrate with scientific evidence that their specific product does in fact pose less risk or is less harmful,\u201d Acting FDA commissioner Ned Sharpless said in a statement.\n\nMike Segar / Reuters Vaping company Juul Inc. is accused of marketing its e-cigarette products as a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes without the FDA's approval.\n\n\u201cJUUL has ignored the law, and very concerningly, has made some of these statements in school to our nation\u2019s youth,\u201d Sharpless added.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s letter cited past incidents involving a Juul representative who was quoted as telling students at a school that Juul\u2019s products are \u201ctotally safe\u201d and that the \u201cFDA was about to come out and say it was 99% safer than cigarettes.\u201d\n\nThe FDA requested a written response within 15 days from Juul that will describe in detail the corrective actions it will take. If it does not believe its products violated federal regulations, it must provide a reasoning for why not.\n\nRonen Zvulun / Reuters The CDC has issued a warning against vaping after several deaths and hundreds of illnesses were linked to e-cigarette use.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the letters and will fully cooperate,\u201d a Juul spokesperson told HuffPost in response to the letter.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s letter comes just days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a nationwide warning against vaping after several deaths and hundreds of illnesses were linked to e-cigarette use.\n\nAs of Friday, health officials have identified 450 possible cases, including at least three deaths, in 33 states. A single product has not been tied to the illnesses. Many, but not all of them, involved individuals who have vaped THC, which is the psychoactive compound found in marijuana.", "description": "The vaping company is also accused of marketing its products to students, calling e-cigarettes \"totally safe.\"", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7677ae3b00002a74d0c38e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
