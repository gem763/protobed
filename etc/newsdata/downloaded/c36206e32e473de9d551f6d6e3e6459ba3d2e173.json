The trend grows stronger as billionaires grow older, they said.\n\nMonday\u2019s study is a peek into the many ways the rich minimize taxes and transfer wealth to the next generation. But it\u2019s also a reminder that the less-than-filthy-rich can also avoid and minimize estate tax hits \u2014 without pulling up stakes and moving elsewhere.\n\nThe federal government and state governments use estate taxes to tax the transfer of wealth and property from the deceased to their heirs.\n\nTwenty-nine states have no estate tax, the study said. The federal estate tax of 40% kicks in for estates valued at $11.4 million for an individual and $22.8 million for a married couple.\n\nUntil 2001, the federal government issued a tax credit to taxpayers that covered state-level estate taxes. \u201cIn effect, the federal government picked up the tab for taxpayers,\u201d the study said. Tax cuts during under the Bush administration repealed the credit.\n\nResearchers looked at what happened once that federal tax credit went away:\n\n\u2022 In 2010, one in five billionaires that once lived in an estate-tax state moved to a state that didn\u2019t have the tax.\n\n\u2022 Almost 43% of billionaires 65 and older originally in an estate-tax state moved to a state without the laws.\n\n\u2022 How much money is at stake for the filthy rich? A billionaire\u2019s death resulted, on average, in a $165 million influx in state estate revenues.\n\nThough the research showed billionaires moving away from states with estate taxes, the researchers said many states still benefitted from having an estate law on the books, given the money that could come into the coffers.\n\nIf Washington state resident Jeff Bezos, CEO and found of Amazon AMZN, -1.09%, passed away, researchers estimated his estate would get hit with a $11.97 billion estate-tax bill. Bezos is the world\u2019s richest man, worth an estimated $110 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: It\u2019s getting harder and harder to crack into the 1%, according to latest IRS data\n\nHere are some strategies for everyone else to consider.\n\nPass on increasingly valuable assets, without the tax\n\nThough capital gains taxes can take a cut of an asset with increasing value, like the sale of stock, tax laws also include what\u2019s called the \u201cstep-up in basis.\u201d That means an asset resets in value for tax purposes once it\u2019s given to an heir. When the value is readjusted, appreciation rates are smaller and so are any capital gains taxes upon sale.\n\n\u201cAnything you own that appreciates in value is generally going to be subject to the step-up in basis benefit,\u201d said William Dendy, president of Elite Financial Management, which has various offices in Texas. That could include anything from stock to land to baseball cards, he noted.\n\nRemember charitable contributions\n\nAs the study notes, the charitable donations specified in a will are not taxed. \u201cEstates worth $20 million or more deducted 24% of their taxable wealth,\u201d researchers said. Smaller-sized estates can also shave down their taxable size through donations, Repak noted.\n\nRemember the gift\n\nMichael Repak, vice president, senior estate planner with Janney Montgomery Scott in the Philadelphia area, said people seeking to minimize state-level estate bills should think about gifting non- or lower appreciating assets while they are living.\n\nAn heir wouldn\u2019t avoid many, if any, capitals gains taxes because the value doesn\u2019t grow as much over time, he said. So it\u2019s best to distribute these kinds of assets before they are valued in the estate and subject to a tax bill. These assets can include cash and bonds, Repak said.\n\nOther experts note that individuals can give a maximum $15,000 every year in gifts ($30,000 for couple) without using up any of the federal gift and estate exemption amounts. It\u2019s an unlimited amount if the gift goes directly towards a recipient\u2019s college tuition or their medical expenses.", "description": "Middle-class Americans can learn some financially savvy strategies from the ultra-wealthy.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT723_billio_ZG_20191021135808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
