'So many of us were scratching our heads in shock, wondering how something like this could even happen.'\n\nThere was a video montage which highlighted AT&T\u2019s, Warner Bros.\u2019 and Turner\u2019s accomplishments as individual companies that have merged together.\n\nReporters at CNN were shocked at the decision to hire Morgan Freeman to do a voice-over for a company meeting after the network broke a story detailing sexual harassment against him\n\nChloe Melas, (left), is the CNN reporter who wrote the article who claims Freeman called her 'ripe.' She wrote the story with her editor An Phung, (right)\n\nThere were pictures of telephones, movies and CNN reporters were shown on the screen at Warner Bros.\n\nJohn Stankey, the AT&T president and COO and WarnerMedia CEO, then made an announcement to introduce the company\u2019s new streaming service.\n\nFreeman's voice was then heard saying: 'Innovation: It can be born out of a single spark.\n\n'And this spark has spread to change our lives forever, connecting us instantaneously through the stars high above. Today, that spark is continuing to spread,' Variety reported.\n\nLast May the Shawshank Redemption star, 82, apologized after being accused of widespread sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior, saying that he never intended to make 'anyone feel disrespected or uncomfortable'.\n\nIt came after a piece was published by CNN detailing allegations of misconduct by eight different women.\n\nThe allegations included the claims a young production assistant who alleges Freeman, 80, tried to lift up her skirt repeatedly in 2015.\n\nOnly one woman who claims to have been mistreated by him was named. She is Chloe Melas, the CNN reporter who wrote the article who claims Freeman called her 'ripe' and told her: 'Boy I want to be there' as she interviewed him while six months pregnant in 2017.\n\nOther women said he behaved like a 'creepy uncle' at Revelations Entertainment, his production company, and that his unwanted glances and treatment of them forced them to stop wearing skirts or dresses in the office.\n\nThe production assistant who claims he tried to lift up her skirt repeatedly to see if she was wearing underwear said the incident happened in 2015 on the set of Going In Style.\n\nChloe Melas, the CNN reporter who wrote the article who claims Freeman called her 'ripe' and told her: 'Boy I want to be there' as she interviewed him while six months pregnant in 2017\n\nJohn Stankey, the AT&T president and COO and WarnerMedia CEO, made an announcement to introduce the company\u2019s new streaming service and Morgan Freeman's voice could then be heard at a company meeting on Tuesday\n\nShe alleged that Alan Arkin, Freeman's co-star in the movie, was there and intervened.\n\nShe said: '[He] kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear.\n\n'Alan [Arkin] made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say.'\n\nThe woman was in her early 20s and Freeman was 78 at the time. Another, who was described as a senior member of production staff who worked with him on Now You See Me in 2012, claimed it was common knowledge that he 'harassed' females on set.\n\n'He did comment on our bodies... We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms, meaning not wearing clothes that [were] fitted,' she said.\n\nAnother former staffer there alleged that when she met him for the first time on the set of his series Through The Wormhole, which began in 2010, he 'looked her up and down and asked: \"How do you feel about sexual harassment?.\"\n\nIn a statement shortly after the piece was published, he DailyMail.com: 'Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy.\n\n'I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2014 that was never my intent.'\n\nHowever the actor's legal team later demanded a retraction from CNN and threatened a possible lawsuit over the story accusing the actor of sexual misconduct.\n\nOne production assistant who claims Freeman tried to lift up her skirt repeatedly to see if she was wearing underwear said the incident happened in 2015 on the set of Going In Style. The movie also starred Michael Caine and Alan Arkin\n\nFreeman's lawyers also used their letter to suggest that Melas, who co-wrote the story with her editor An Phung, may have been motivated by racism or a desire to advance her career when she published her claims\n\nAmong the many points made by Freeman in the letter is the fact that the comment which fueled reporter Chloe Melas' investigation into him was not even made to her, but rather in response to a story his co-star Michael Caine had been telling at the press junket for Going In Style.\n\nThis comes just two days after one of the woman labeled as a Freeman accuser in story, Tyra Martin, said on-air that her comments were misrepresented and she did not at any point deem the actor's behavior inappropriate.\n\nFreeman's lawyers also use their letter to suggest that Melas, who co-wrote the story with her editor An Phung, may have been motivated by racism or a desire to advance her career when she published her claims.\n\nA spokesman for CNN told DailyMail.com: 'The unfounded accusations made by Mr. Freeman\u2019s lawyer are disappointing and are difficult to reconcile with Mr. Freeman\u2019s own public statements in the aftermath of the story.\n\n'CNN stands by its reporting and will respond forcefully to any attempt by Mr. Freeman or his representatives to intimidate us from covering this important public issue.'\n\n'One cannot know if that was the product of something as innocuous as Ms. Melas\u2019 having misheard what Mr. Freeman said, her runaway self-centeredness, or her search for a sexual harassment perpetrator to \"expose\" so that she could grab attention and advance her career,' reads the letter at one point.\n\nOther than Melas, McCreary and Martin are the only two women who are identified by name in the story.\n\n'Based on those facts, and the additional information presented below, it is clear that CNN has defamed Mr. Freeman. CNN has inflicted serious injury on his reputation and career,' states the letter from Freeman's attorneys at Irell & Manella.\n\n'At a minimum, CNN immediately needs to issue a retraction and apologize to Mr. Freeman through the same channels, and with the same level of attention, that it used to unjustly attack him on May 24.'", "description": "WarnerMedia hired Morgan Freeman to do a voice-over for a company presentation which shocked reporters at CNN after they broke a sexual harassment story about him.", "authors": ["Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/23/20401416-0-image-a-49_1572477311361.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
