But her lawyer clarified the hook up happened in high school\n\nThe new man: The 47-year-old TV star shares this photo from her phone to her co-stars; his name is Tony and he is a longtime friend of the family\n\n'The clip in the newer supertease is Teresa, her brother and a lifelong friend named Tony talking about Teresa and Tony kissing when they were in high school more than 25 years ago,' James Leonard Jr. told Us Weekly.\n\nNow Giudice feels 'very hurt' by the editing, according to an Us source.\n\nAnd it comes at a very bad time in her life as she is 'trying to keep her family together and work on her marriage.'\n\nGood ole Tony: Later she meets up with Tony as well as her brother Joe Gorga\n\nIn the past, the 47-year-old TV star, who was incarcerated herself for over a year, has adamantly denied that she has cheated on her husband of 20 years.\n\nMany times she has been pictured with other men but she has always said that they were just friends.\n\nAnd Tony seems to be just another friend.\n\nTogether Joe and Teresa have four daughters: Gia, 18, Gabriella, 15, Milania, 14, and Audriana, 10.\n\nNo love? The mother-of-four admits she is not sure if she still loves Joe. Here they are seen before he was jailed\n\nShe listens: The raven-haired beauty then tells her sister in law Melissa Gorga more. 'I haven't been happy in so long,' she admits. 'And I just want to be happy again. I feel like I'm living the worst nightmare ever'\n\nIn the new teaser, Teresa complains to costar Jennifer Aydin about her marriage to Joe, who is currently living in Italy.\n\nWhen asked if she is still in love with Joe she said, 'I don't know.'\n\nThe raven-haired beauty then tells her sister in law Melissa Gorga more.\n\n'I haven't been happy in so long,' she admits. 'And I just want to be happy again. I feel like I'm living the worst nightmare ever.'\n\n'Teresa, she doesn't know if she's coming or going,' Melissa says in a voiceover. 'She doesn't know if she's going to be staying married to someone or not.'\n\nStunned: Later she tells co-star Danielle Staub she wants an escape. And adds she feels like 'drinking a bottle of tequila every night'\n\nNot interested: In the past Teresa has said that if Joe was deported she would 'not be doing a long-distance relationship'\n\nLeaning on alcohol: And frequently Teresa is seen enjoying a drink\n\nJudging her: Margaret Josephs, 52, adds, 'Teresa is cocktailing it up all night while her husband is sitting in an ICE facility. That is shameful'\n\n'Teresa's a mess,' Dolores Catania, 48, says. 'There is so much stress in that house.'\n\nAydin, 42, calls her 'a ticking time bomb.'\n\nLater she tells co-star Danielle Staub she wants an escape. And Teresa adds she feels like 'drinking a bottle of tequila every night.'\n\nThen she brings up the other man, who was not named in the trailer.\n\nThe bella life: Joe, 49, is now in Italy with his brother. In new images he has shown off a slimmer physique\n\n'He's the one I hooked up with,' says Teresa after showing her co-stars a photo of a shirtless man on her cell phone.\n\nHer brother Joe Gorga then talks to Teresa and the man who seems to be the same man from the picture.\n\n'Were you guys messing around?' asks her over-protective brother.\n\nSo sad: Daughter Gia says that she is not sure she is ready to let go as she tears up\n\n'We might have kissed,' Tony admits.\n\nIt's never made clear in the clip that they hooked up decades ago, if Teresa's lawyer is accurate.\n\nSome of her co-stars are seen coming down hard on Teresa.\n\nMargaret Josephs, 52, strikes out the hardest.\n\nTogether Joe and Teresa have four daughters: Gia, 18, Gabriella, 15, Milania, 14, and Audriana, 10\n\n'Teresa is cocktailing it up all night while her husband is sitting in an ICE facility. That is shameful,' she roars.\n\nAlso in the clip, Teresa is seen getting livid at a friend ('Shut up b****') who accused her of being reckless.\n\nTeresa explains if you keep poking a bear, the bear will explode.\n\nAnother another star says that she has gone from 'namaste to nasty.'\n\nShe is also told she is the 'worst f***ing mother' and is seen walking off the set.\n\nJoe, 49, is now in Italy with his brother. In new images he has shown off a slimmer physique.\n\nIn the past Teresa has said that if Joe was deported she would 'not be doing a long-distance relationship.'\n\nHe is now waiting his final appeal in his ongoing deportation battle. A final ruling is expected in November.\n\nJoe was born in Italy but moved to the US as a child. His parents did not follow through on making him a citizen.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey premieres November 6 (at 8 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "description": "It seemed as if Teresa Giudice had  admitted to cheating on her husband of 20 years, Joe Giudice when the new trailer for season 10 of\u00a0the RHONJ on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/19/19800688-0-image-a-67_1571249167329.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
