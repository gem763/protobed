The red line is blood red.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Consent\n\nConservative leader Mr Johnson often labelled his predecessor\u2019s backstop plans \u201cundemocratic\u201d and sought a mechanism to give Northern Ireland an opt-in or way out of his Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThere has been disagreement over how the so-called `Stormont lock\u00b4 would work (Niall Carson/PA)\n\nThe EU rejected plans to give the Stormont Assembly a veto every four years on the border deal but is said to have conceded to a unilateral exit arrangement, using a vote mechanism concocted by Assembly members.\n\nA rejection of the plans by the Assembly, which is currently suspended, would bring in a two-year cooling-off period in which a way of saving the Good Friday agreement would need to be found, according to The Times.\n\nThe DUP fears that moves to bypass the petition of concern \u2013 a unique political tool that allows unionist or nationalist groups to reject reforms in Northern Ireland \u2013 could upset the balance of the once-warring communities.\n\n\u2013 VAT\n\nThe EU and the UK have yet to agree what VAT regime Northern Ireland would follow (Kirsty O\u00b4Connor/PA)\n\nBrussels and the UK are reportedly in a wrangle over VAT and whether EU rates should apply in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe objection from Downing Street was described by EU diplomats as a \u201cBritish smokescreen\u201d to give Number 10 more time to win over the DUP, according to The Guardian.\n\nHow concerned Mrs Foster is about staying with the UK\u2019s VAT rate is unclear, and whether she is using the disagreement to show there are issues being voiced by more than just her own party remains to be seen.", "description": "Party leader Arlene Foster has dented hopes that a deal can be signed off this week after voicing opposition to the draft terms.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/wire-19825516-1571298533-862_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
