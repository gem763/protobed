His teammates then lined up in front of the away supporters and saluted.\n\nTurkey\u2019s veteran coach Senol Gunes defended the team\u2019s action, saying it was a gesture of respect for the armed forces rather than a political statement or agitation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to look for malicious intentions in the soldier\u2019s salute. We are doing it to look out for our soldiers. We are not doing it so that our soldiers go and kill people,\u201d Gunes told a post-match press conference.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always asking me about the salute, but it\u2019s way above me. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s business, it\u2019s Macron\u2019s business,\u201d he said, referring to the U.S. and French presidents. \u201cThey are the ones who rule the world, while I can barely rule the team.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, accused by critics of giving a de facto green light to the cross-border offensive, has called on Turkey to cease fire. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron has also urged Ankara to stop the military action.\n\nTurkey lead Group H of the Euro 2020 qualifiers, ahead of France on goal difference.\n\nOn Monday, Turkish midfielder Cenk Sahin was released by German team St Pauli following his Instagram post supporting Turkey\u2019s military incursion.\n\n\u201cCenk Sahin has been released from his training and playing duties with immediate effect,\u201d St Pauli said in a statement.\n\nThe Turkish Football Federation posted a tweet after the Albania game last week, which showed the players and coaching staff in the dressing room making the military salute.\n\nIn the tweet, the federation wrote that the team \u201cdedicated their victory to our brave soldiers and fellow martyrs.\u201d", "description": "Turkey's national side are being investigated by European soccer body UEFA after players celebrated their goal in a 1-1 draw against world champions France with a military salute to soldiers fighting in northeast Syria.", "authors": ["Ece Toksabay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
