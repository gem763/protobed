His visit included a school tour and a town hall-style assembly. More\n\n\"This is why I'm here,\" he added. \"I want to listen to those who feel, perhaps, differently than I do, (and) include their point of view and ideas in whatever becomes the final piece of legislation or the law that we adopt.\"\n\nAsked about his response by reporters later in the morning, O'Rourke reiterated that it's something he would consider.\n\n\"I'm open to the idea of \u2014 actually as proposed originally by Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-California) \u2014 that in a mandatory buyback there would be places like a gun range or a hunting lodge where you could securely keep an AR-15 or an AK-47. I'm open to it,\" he said.\n\nHunters and hunting outlets include reasons and instructions for using AR-15s or AK-47s for deer hunting.\n\nO'Rourke has made advocating for a mandatory ban and buyback of assault weapons a major focus of his campaign, especially after the Aug. 3 shooting that killed 22 and injured dozens in his hometown of El Paso.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke poses for selfies with high school students after an assembly Friday morning at North High School in Des Moines. More\n\nHis gun safety plan includes creating a nationwide gun licensing system and registry, requiring universal background checks for gun purchases, implementing \"red flag\" laws, banning the purchase of assault-style weapons and requiring people to sell existing assault-style weapons to the government.\n\nAt the September Democratic debate, O'Rourke's remark of \"Hell, yes we're going to take your AR-15,\" elicited strong reactions from his supporters and his critics.\n\nO'Rourke's visit to North High School Friday morning capped a three-day trip to Iowa that included a town hall at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, a roundtable discussion at the Iowa Harm Reduction Coalition Office in Cedar Rapids and a Des Moines town hall hosted by the League of Latin American Citizens and Newsmax TV.\n\nWhile in Iowa, he released a plan to address substance use disorders and the opioid epidemic.\n\nHis Friday-morning school visit included stops in high school government and English classes, followed by a school assembly where his campaign staff said they expected about 300 students to attend. Several students crowded around afterward to snap selfies and ask more direct questions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: Election 2020: Beto O'Rourke 'open' to letting people keep AR-15s, AK-47s", "description": "Beto O'Rourke on Friday left the door open for allowing some people to keep assault-style weapons like AR-15s and AK-47s at gun ranges and hunting clubs.", "authors": ["Ian Richardson", "Des Moines Register"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y85QcrC059_e4EFAZdvmeA--~B/aD0zMDI0O3c9NDAzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/49260cf1ba82ce140742fb66b9120676", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
