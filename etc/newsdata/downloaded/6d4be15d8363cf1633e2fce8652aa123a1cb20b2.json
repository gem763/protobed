(Picture: Getty/Instagram/nickcarter)\n\nNick Carter has revealed that he has named his newborn daughter Saoirse Reign, after wife Lauren Kitt gave birth last week.\n\nThe couple debuted their little bundle of joy in US Weekly, with the Backstreet Boys singer then taking to Instagram to gush about his new child and her amazing mother.\n\n\u2018To my incredibly strong wife\u2026 For 2 years I watched you endure some of the hardest things a husband could ever witness,\u2019 he wrote.\n\n\u2018Going through the ups and downs of pregnancy all in the hopes that just maybe, with a little help from up above, we would get to this point. So on January 28th 2019 when I walked out of that bathroom with that positive test I already knew that Saoirse was coming back to us.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018I just want to thank you for giving me the Life, Love and family that I always wanted. You are a true Warrior and I love you.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, US confirmed that Nick had become a father for the second time on 2 October, with a representative telling the publication that \u2018Mom and daughter are doing great.\u2019\n\nThe singer was in awe of his wife and newborn daughter (Picture: Instagram/nickcarter)\n\nDays before Lauren gave birth, Nick had shared a clip of the baby\u2019s heartbeat during a scan, with the sweet caption: \u2018I\u2019m starting to get emotional #heartbeat #baby #newbaby #newfather #happy #love #godgiveuspeace.\u2019\n\nThe 39-year-old then shared a photo from a recent shoot with Us Weekly, in which he cradles his 36-year-old wife\u2019s baby bump.\n\nHe wrote alongside the image: \u2018Eagerly awaiting our new addition #odinsabigbrother.\u2019\n\nThe news is particularly poignant for the couple, who have had a tough time recently after suffering a heartbreaking of miscarriage last year.\n\nAdditionally, Nick was recently forced to obtain a restraining order against his brother, fellow singer Aaron Carter, who allegedly threatened to harm Lauren and their then-unborn child.\n\nBut it seems the 31-year-old has had a change of heart, tweeting in the wake of the birth: \u2018I\u2019ve been very hurt by the fact that my big brother has not made an effort to be part of my life for a long time so therefore I lashed out & said some hurtful things I did not mean to say I love my brother I love my family and all I want is peace and love for everybody [sic].\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing like new life to bring a family together, eh?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
