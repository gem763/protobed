At the time, Sheindlin would agree to continue starring in the courtroom TV show only if she had rights to the show's library. However, a 2017 press release from CBS announced that the network acquired the library back.\n\nJUDGE JUDY MADE $147 MILLION IN 2018, AND ONLY SHOOTS SHOWS FOR TWO MONTHS\n\n\"I'm overjoyed that CBS will continue to shepherd my program and be the custodian of the library,\" Sheindlin said in the press release. \"They are the gold standard in television, and I\u2019m fortunate to be in business with such talented people.\"\n\nBut in the latest twist, according to court documents from the lawsuit obtained by THR, the sale may never have taken place after all.\n\n\"A review of the 2015 and 2017 agreements reflects that no such sale to Sheindlin ever occurred, and so no sale back to the CBS defendants occurred either,\" CBS attorneys said in the court files this month. \"The written contracts reflect that a sale to Sheindlin was contemplated, but never consummated.\"\n\nThe lawyers also claimed the 2017 deal \"canceled\" the \"contemplated transfer\" of rights to the library.\n\nDespite the new questions over its accuracy, the press release was still active on CBS's website as of Wednesday.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Switzer and Spreckman were demanding all relevant documents from CBS and Sheindlin regarding the 2015 and 2017 negotiations, including emails exchanged between Sheindlin and former CBS attorney David Theodosopoulos. The network claimed the messages were protected under attorney-client privilege.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoth sides are scheduled to appear in court this Thursday to discuss the documents.\n\nCBS declined to comment.", "description": "CBS seems to have offered mixed signals over whether it ever bought the rights to the \"Judge Judy\" library.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
