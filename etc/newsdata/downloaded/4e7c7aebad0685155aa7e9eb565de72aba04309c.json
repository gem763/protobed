Though he's typically known for making surreal creature features, his most recent film is terrifyingly realistic.\n\nThe film, which is almost entirely in Korean, is a thriller about two families, one rich and one poor, and how they worm their way into each other's lives. Bong calls it a tragi-comedy \u2014 and for him those two things, tragedy and comedy, can't exist without each other.\n\nWith help from his interpreter Sharon Choi, Bong joined q's Tom Power from New York to talk about what inspired him to make a thriller about income inequality, and why wealth can make monsters of us all.\n\nParasite is South Korea's official submission for best international feature film at the Oscars. It opens all across Canada on Friday, Oct. 25.\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with Bong Joon-ho.\n\n\u2014 Produced by Vanessa Greco", "description": "Parasite director Bong Joon-ho tells us what inspired him to make a thriller about income inequality, and why wealth can make monsters of us all.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284446.1568562602!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/parasite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
