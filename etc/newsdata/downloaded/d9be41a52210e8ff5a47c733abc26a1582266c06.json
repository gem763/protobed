But her and \u201cMr. J\u201d have since broken up, leaving her free to explore the time-honored tradition of amassing your girl gang together and leaning into personal transformations in the wake of a trash relationship. And we are all the better for it, since the outcome is Birds of Prey. Harley wants to prove she\u2019s the scariest force in Gotham, and alongside her will be Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), and Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), fighting for the chaotic good. (And since Harley is here, probably a little bit of chaotic evil, too?) There are also some men here, including Ewan McGregor as Black Mask and Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz. Birds of Prey is directed by Cathy Yan and hits theaters on February 7.\n\nRelated", "description": "Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Jurnnee Smollett-Bell, Ewan McGregor, Chris Messina, and more star in the trailer for the DC Comics movie Birds of Prey.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/01/01-birds-of-prey.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
