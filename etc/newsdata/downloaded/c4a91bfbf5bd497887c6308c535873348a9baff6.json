It was clearly definable.\n\nMr Lawrence's 18-year-old brother Stephen (pictured) was stabbed to death in an unprovoked racist attack in Eltham\n\n'Now, it seems that all you have to do is accidentally brush someone on the street, or on the train, and that person takes issue and wants to attack you.'\n\nHe added: 'Kids are carrying knives because they're scared of being made to look like idiots on social media. The landscape has changed since Stephen and it is far more complex.'\n\nMr Lawrence called on social media firms and web giants to crack down, adding: 'Social media companies need to do a lot more taking down stuff that's inappropriate.\n\n'It's going to take a whole generation to revert what we have done. We need to go back to what we know works. To have places for young people to go, to have other young people supporting [them].'\n\nHe also revealed his concerns for his son, Theo, eight, who he has yet to tell of his uncle's murder.\n\n'When is the right time to burst his bubble that not everyone is nice?' he said. Mr Lawrence was a guest at the Community Initiative To Reduce Violence summit this month.", "description": "Stuart Lawrence, 42, warned that UK teenagers have become 'numbed' to violence through graphic social media, music videos and computer games and called on internet companies to act.", "authors": ["Claire Duffin", "John Siddle For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19970308-0-image-a-86_1571614853058.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
