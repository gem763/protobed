The government sold the property in 1948. The rental property was converted to condominiums in 1981.\n\nToday, the property is two complexes \u2014 Vaughan Place at McLean Gardens and McLean Gardens. Bounded by Rodman Street NW to the north, Idaho Avenue to the south, Wisconsin Avenue to the east and 39th Street NW to the west, McLean Gardens resembles a self-contained college campus. The isolation is a major draw for residents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn my mind, McLean Gardens is the best of both worlds,\u201d says Lisa Mize, president of McLean Gardens Condo Association. \u201cOnce you drive off Wisconsin Avenue and you get into the neighborhood, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in a city.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have deer that wander through the neighborhood. When your windows are open you can hear all the birds singing outside and on a summer night you hear the foxes and the cicadas in the trees. It really feels like you\u2019re in the country in a way . . .but also being able to find that energy within a few blocks.\u201d\n\nMize moved to McLean Gardens more than 20 years ago. She was drawn by the history, the old buildings and the restful atmosphere.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery time I drive into McLean Gardens and all that busyness goes away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like my blood pressure comes down 20 points. For me, it\u2019s such a stark contrast and I really appreciate the peacefulness and serenity here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcLean Gardens also offers a strong sense of community. Both Vaughan Place and McLean Gardens are pet-friendly, with most residents owning at least one cat or dog. The condo association hosts jazz on the lawn, barbecues in the summer at the communal pool, and holiday parties in the community center\u2019s ballroom.\n\nFannie Mae\u2019s former headquarters were next door to McLean Gardens. After Fannie Mae announced its move downtown, Roadside Development acquired the property in 2016. Residents worry about how the changes will affect their idyllic neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the congestion and the traffic,\u201d says Kathy Thomas, a nearly 20-year resident of McLean Gardens. \u201cI feel resigned to the changes but working with Roadside is the best possible scenario we could have because I trust them to do what\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRichard Lake, a founding partner with the company, has been working with the condo board to address residents\u2019 questions and concerns.\n\n\u201cWe entered into a cooperation agreement with our neighbors at McLean Gardens,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThey\u2019ve formed a neighborhood action committee which we participate in so there\u2019s direct communication on an as-necessary basis.\u201d\n\nRoadside will preserve Fannie Mae\u2019s large front lawn as a park and common area that could include an interactive fountain for children to play in, a performance stage for concerts, art displays or movies. There will be a Wegman\u2019s grocery store, a child-care center and a health club. Restaurants and retail are still being negotiated.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be a town center and take away the energy from Wisconsin Avenue, we actually want to help the energy on Wisconsin Avenue,\u201d Lake says.\n\nAccording to Lake, the six residential buildings within the planned village will be smaller, boutique-style apartments. Most will be rentals, but one could become condos. Amenities could include a greenhouse on the roof for organic farming, reflecting pools, music rooms and spaces for activities. Apartments will range from one-bedroom to three-bedroom units, with 8 percent allocated for inclusionary zoning.\n\nIncreased traffic is one of the residents\u2019 biggest concerns. Lake concedes that their concerns are valid but believes traffic won\u2019t be as bad as they fear.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFannie Mae here employed about 3,000 workers, so that was peak in the morning and peak in the evening as they were leaving,\u201d Lake said. \u201cOur development will have a fraction of that as far as employees go.\u201d\n\n\"We're looking into introducing a shuttle that will take people from our property to the Metro,\" Lake said.\n\nLiving there: No properties are for sale in McLean Gardens. According to real estate agent Lou Vivas at Viva the Life Properties, nine properties were sold in the past year. They ranged from a four-bedroom, two-bathroom duplex for $681,800 to a 506-square-foot studio that sold for $245,000. There are 14 units available to rent at Vaughan Place at McLean Gardens, ranging from studios ($1,991 to $2,512 a month), to two-bedroom, two-bathroom units ($3,133 to $4,013 a month). One-bedroom units are available for between $2,354 and $3,129 a month.\n\nTransportation: The closest Metro station is Tenleytown on the Red Line, about a 20-minute walk away. The N4 and N6 bus lines stop nearby.\n\nSchools: Eaton Elementary, Hardy Middle, Wilson High.\n\nAD", "description": "WHERE WE LIVE | Residents hope to keep its rural feel as new housing replaces Fannie Mae\u2019s former headquarters.", "authors": ["Nina Zafar", "Reporter", "Editorial Aide For Reliable Source"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/07fsM5iIPn1hXXvpUwMgev9-ZtU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3XRU3NHPYUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
