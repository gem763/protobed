Asks Judges to Block Subpoena", "language": "en", "text": "The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court on Friday to stop the release of President Trump\u2019s tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, arguing that local prosecutors should have to meet a very high legal bar before investigating a sitting president.\n\nThe filing meant Mr. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department was lending support to his attempt to block a subpoena demanding eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. The district attorney\u2019s office issued the subpoena to Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm in late August as part of an investigation into hush-money payments made before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut in its filing, the Justice Department, which is led by Attorney General William P. Barr, stopped short of endorsing Mr. Trump\u2019s most sweeping argument: that sitting presidents are totally immune from all criminal investigations.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers had made the argument in a lawsuit attempting to shield his tax returns from the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr.", "description": "But the department did not agree with President Trump\u2019s lawyers that a sitting president is immune from criminal investigation.", "authors": ["Benjamin Weiser", "William K.
