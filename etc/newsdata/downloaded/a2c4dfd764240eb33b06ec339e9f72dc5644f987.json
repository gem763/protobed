Until there's a legal text, we're not going to make a decision. We've come this far. Euroskeptics always pay attention to meticulous and detailed analysis of the legal texts and that's what we'll do this time as well.\"\n\nJohnson told MPs at the meeting that a deal was close but Thursday's summit of EU leaders \"was still shrouded in mist,\" Baker said. \"He said we're on the Hillary Step on the way up to Everest.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the government put forward a motion calling for a special Saturday sitting of parliament \u2014 an opportunity for MPs to vote in favor of a deal should one be secured. It remains unclear whether the sitting will go ahead if no deal is reached ahead of the summit. The government will decide whether to move the motion to a vote in the House of Commons on Thursday.\n\nIt is expected that the Saturday sitting will run from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. but ultimately the decision on timing will be for MPs, who must vote for the motion to guarantee the sitting takes place.", "description": "British prime minister says \u2018outstanding issues\u2019 remain.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181194674-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
