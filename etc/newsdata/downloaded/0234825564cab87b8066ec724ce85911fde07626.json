But is it really a win for Russia?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE President Trump said Syria has \"got a lot of sand\" while talking about Turkey's invasion of the country. USA TODAY\n\nTrump's disastrous actions may have increased Russia's position in the Middle East. But that may turn into more of a headache than a boon for Russia.\n\nOne of the criticisms leveled at President Donald Trump\u2019s actions in Syria is that they represent a gain for Russia.\n\nThat, however, raises the question: What is Russia gaining that threatens or diminishes U.S. interests?\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the obvious: Trump\u2019s actions in Syria have been a disaster. And his Middle East policy generally is incoherent.\n\nTrump essentially greenlit the Turkish invasion by withdrawing U.S. troops and making a public statement that neither condemned nor condoned it.\n\nHe then apparently had a change of sentiment and, among other things, sent Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an imbecilic letter threatening to destroy his country\u2019s economy.\n\nPence's deal: Turkey wins, Kurds lose\n\nThe \u201cdeal\u201d that Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo supposedly negotiated can be easily summarized: Turkey wins; the Kurds lose.\n\nWhat Turkey wanted from the invasion was a safe zone along its Syrian border that the Kurds didn\u2019t control. The \u201cdeal\u201d gave Turkey that and gave the Kurds five days to evacuate.\n\nCLOSE The House condemned Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria because now Turkey is attacking Kurds, who have been our allies against ISIS. USA TODAY\n\nWhile I don\u2019t think that the United States should have been willing to take up arms against Turkey on behalf of the Kurds, Trump\u2019s public belittling of them as allies is one of the more shameful foreign policy acts of an American president in my lifetime.\n\nThe Kurds were frontline fighters against Islamic State. Without them, eradicating the caliphate would have been much bloodier for the United States. If Trump felt that our country\u2019s national interest required abandoning them to Turkey, he shouldn\u2019t have crapped on them on the way out.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the overwhelming majority of House Republicans joined Democrats in passing a resolution in opposition to Trump\u2019s actions in Syria.\n\nTrump isn't getting out of the Middle East\n\nTrump says that his actions there are motivated by a desire to reduce the U.S. involvement in the Middle East. I\u2019m all for that.\n\nBut he also has bought into the neoconservative view that U.S. policy in the region should be centered in combating and limiting the influence of Iran, siding with the Sunni powers \u2014 particularly Saudi Arabia \u2014 in the competition for regional predominance. Some of the troops being withdrawn from Syria are being relocated to Saudi Arabia.\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board: Syria policy wasn't broke. Why is Donald Trump wrecking it?\n\nThat\u2019s getting more involved in the snake pit of Middle East geopolitics.\n\nWhich brings us to Russia.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from Syria does increase the position of Russia. But is that a gain or a headache?\n\nThe Kurds have formed an alliance with Bashar Assad\u2019s Syrian regime. Neither wants the Turks in Syria.\n\nRussia has provided life support to Assad. It is trying to wean Turkey from the West, with some success.\n\nRussia can't be friends with everyone\n\nVladimir Putin and Donald Trump (Photo: AP)\n\nSo, how does Russia balance assisting Assad in restoring Syria\u2019s territorial integrity with the desire to woo Turkey? Does Russian strongman Vladimir Putin tell Assad that he has to accept effective Turkish annexation of a hunk of his country? Or does he issue an eviction notice to Erdogan?\n\nAnd what if the Kurds and the Syrians want to continue the fight against the Turks? Or the Turks want a larger safety zone and are willing to fight for it? If it is a shooting war, what does Russia do?\n\nRussia can no longer pretend to be friends with everyone\n\nRussia has tried to be friendly with everyone in the Middle East, Syria and Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Israel and those who want to see it destroyed.\n\nThey were the best kind of ally: I fought alongside the Kurds. The United States can't abandon our fierce allies to Turkey.\n\nThat was possible so long as the United States was the dominant outside power in the region. Russia could be the understanding shoulder whenever Middle Eastern countries had disagreements or disappointments with the U.S.\n\nThat\u2019s not possible to the extent Russia becomes the dominant outside power, as it is in Syria. As second fiddle, you can dance around the edges of the snake pit of Middle East geopolitics. As first chair, you are in the pit. The others in the pit hate each other. And they periodically shoot at each other.\n\nAmerican politics regarding Russia are head-turning. Democrats are far more anti-Russian than they ever were anti-Soviet, even though the Soviet Union posed a much greater threat to U.S. interests than Russia does.\n\nSo long as Trump is president, U.S. foreign policy will be erratic, unpredictable and unreliable.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to worry about that. A larger role for Russia in the Middle East isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nRobert Robb is a columnist for the Arizona Republic, where this column originally appeared.
