REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nThe increased scrutiny was aimed at avoiding the chaos of last weekend, when protesters blocked airport approach roads, threw debris on to train tracks and trashed the MTR subway station in the nearby new town of Tung Chung.\n\nProtesters also occupied the arrivals hall last month, halting and delaying flights, amid a series of clashes with police.\n\nThere were some cat-and-mouse standoffs between protesters and police in Tung Chung as night fell on Saturday, but no sign of a return to violence.\n\nThree months of protests have at times paralyzed parts of the city, a major Asian financial hub, amid running street battles between protesters and police who have responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon. Violent arrests of protesters have drawn international attention.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched bags of people on buses and trains headed to the airport where police and press outnumbered passengers.\n\nThere were shouting matches outside the airport between police and people who wanted to pick up arriving family members but were told to go away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. We have our 80-year-old relative coming off the flight. How will she get home without our help?\u201d said Donny, only giving his first name. \u201cThese police don\u2019t listen to anything we have to say. We are normal people.\u201d\n\nMETRO STATIONS ATTACKED\n\nChek Lap Kok airport was built in the dying days of British rule on reclaimed land around a tiny island and is reached by a series of bridges.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators, many masked and dressed in black, attacked MTR metro stations on the Kowloon peninsula on Friday night, targeted because of televised scenes of police beating protesters on a metro train on Aug. 31 as they cowered on the floor.\n\nActivists, angry that the MTR closed stations to stop protesters from gathering and demanding CCTV footage of the beatings, tore down signs, broke turnstiles, set fires on the street and daubed graffiti on the walls.\n\nThe protests have presented Chinese President Xi Jinping with his greatest popular challenge since he came to power in 2012.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week to try to end the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, but many said they were too little, too late. She said Beijing backed her \u201call the way\u201d.\n\nThe bill would have allowed extraditions of people to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. In contrast, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nBut the demonstrations, which began in June, have long since broadened into calls for more democracy and many protesters have pledged to fight on.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is its internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade. Global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings on Friday downgraded Hong Kong\u2019s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to \u201cAA\u201d from \u201cAA+\u201d.\n\nThe U.S. State Department updated its travel advisory for Hong Kong, warning that U.S. citizens and consular employees had been the targets of a recent propaganda campaign by China \u201cfalsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest\u201d.\n\nThe overall risk level remains at the second lowest of a four-level gauge, after it was raised on Aug. 7 to reflect the escalating violence.", "description": "Hong Kong police checked people traveling to the airport for passports and air tickets on Saturday, preventing protesters gathering for another \"stress test\" of road and rail links in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Julie", "Zhu", "Joe Brock", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427246814&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860IF-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
