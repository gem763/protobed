Fast-forward to today, where the endless investigations and hearsay has reached the level of \u201cwhite noise\u201d to the average American who isn\u2019t following the hourly outrage politics of the Left\u2019s lethal version of Trump Derangement Syndrome disease.\n\nThe corruption of the Democrats isn\u2019t new, but the magnitude and velocity is remarkable.\n\nDuring the Obama administration the scandals were legendary, possibly only eclipsed by the Republicans\u2019 feckless efforts in Congress during his administration to indict a single conspirator despite their endless versions of Congressional investigations.\n\nThe end result? Attorney General Eric Holder, held in contempt of Congress, continued to thumb his nose at Congressional subpoenas. Lois Lerner is still drawing a fat pension despite her role in the IRS scandal and cover up. Despite the loss of life in Benghazi - including our ambassador, no government official was ultimately held accountable for that fiasco and the lying narrative foisted upon the public afterward. Despite lying in front of Congress and the American public about spying on American citizens, James Clapper remains a talking head on almost every leftist cable news channel. Obama\u2019s delivery of $1.7 Billion in cash to our Iran, a sworn enemy of the United States. Obama\u2019s possible role in the FISA surveillance of the Trump campaign. Dead silence\u2026 And of course Hillary Clinton, whose role in the sale of uranium to Russia and the alleged subsequent $145 million payment to the Clinton Foundation wreaks of self-dealing. More recently, FBI documents show Clinton wiped more than 340,000 emails from servers including some marked classified, yet the Deep State cadre of malcontents within the FBI were central to the unsuccessful Mueller investigation.\n\nFor those reasons and much, much more - such as illegal immigration, unbalanced trade deals and endless wars, America turned to populist billionaire, Donald J. Trump and elected him president.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 level of intensity in removing Trump has thrown any sense of caution, fairness or due process to the wind.\n\nThe drumbeat of investigations has and will continue to increase in frequency and intensity between now and the 2020 election. Why? The Democrats are literally obsessed with hatred for this man, but even more importantly they absolutely know that his chances of being elected in 2020 are strong, and that scares the you-know-what out of them. Trump is gleefully chomping at the bit to sink his teeth into the final emergent socialist presidential candidate who will run on identity politics, raising taxes to unprecedented levels and inserting the federal government (socialism) into even more of our daily lives.\n\nLike any good Banana Republic wherein in the state owns the media and thus controls the daily propaganda, the synchronized talking points that pour from the complicit cable news channel is remarkable in their coordination. The same can be said of the new propaganda arm of the Left that is fashioned as \u201calgorithms\u201d in social media and giant tech companies.\n\nA Banana Republic never had it so good without a complete government takeover.\n\nThis new Banana Republic has an army of minions embedded as Deep State leakers, liars and operatives that are dangerously dispersed like terrorist cells throughout the federal government including and especially in the FBI, Justice Department and the intelligence community. Even the West Wing may have those sympathetic to this coup.\n\nThe Mueller report was a bust. Their next target was Trump\u2019s tax returns, whose release is being fought on several fronts in the courts. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised, when failing in the courts, that Trump\u2019s tax returns are also leaked.\n\nDelayed on that front by the courts, the alleged whistleblower's claims are the next investigation of this president. And of course, the Democrats knew this was coming. In a typical Banana Republic modus operandi, the CIA changed the \u201curgent concern\u201d whistleblower form ahead of time so that the \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d requirement was removed, paving the way for the current clown show.\n\nNow, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry in secret, with at least six committees involved with the Intelligence Committee leading and contrary to the precedent of previous impeachment inquiries being handled by the Judiciary Committee. When this also fails, there will most assuredly be a new \u201cscandal\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is seemingly zero traction investigating the publicly-admitted quid pro quo of Joe Biden and his son, holding up billions in foreign aid to Ukraine to remove a prosecutor investigating his son.\n\nWelcome to the 2019 version of the United States of America, the newest Banana Republic, compliments of the Democrats.", "description": "During a pause at the constitutional convention in 1787, Benjamin .10/11/2019 1:07:01AM EST.", "authors": ["David Thomas Roberts", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/310/63bce14d-9050-4e10-8086-83180bf4bd73.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
