He faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.\n\nBetween January 2016 and February 2018, Jiang sent around 3,000 fake iPhones, imported from Hong, to Apple, saying they wouldn\u2019t turn on and should be replaced under warranty, prosecutors said.\n\nApple responded by sending almost 1,500 replacement iPhones, each with an approximate resale value of $600. The elaborate scheme cost the company nearly $1 million, OPB reported.\n\nAPPLE TIPPED TO LAUNCH CHEAPEST IPHONE IN YEARS\n\nAPPLE BOOSTING IPHONE 11 PRODUCTION: REPORT\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut called Jiang\u2019s fraud \u201congoing and calculated,\u201d resulting in \u201ca very serious offense.\u201d\n\nJiang\u2019s attorney, Celia Howes, argued her client deserved probation because the scheme involved bigger players in China who were responsible for manufacturing the fake iPhones. She reduced Jiang\u2019s role in the scheme to: \u201creceive, send in, return.\u201d\n\nAddressing the judge through a translator, Jiang said he has changed since committing the fraud and referred to himself back then as \u201cna\u00efve, innocent, and kind of stupid,\u201d the Oregonian/Oregon Live reported.\n\nIt\u2019s likely Jiang will be deported back to China after his imprisonment because is no longer eligible to reside in the United States. Jiang has paid $200,000 in restitution to the company.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Bounds, who prosecuted the case, said he\u2019s witnessed similar schemes play out before.
