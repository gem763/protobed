It\u2019s my first issue in awhile, because I was teaching in another department for the last few years. The table of contents is below [The photo above is the one the reader sent; all the articles are behind a subscriber paywall. \u2014 RD].\n\nThis publication used to be a great resource for lesson plan and assessment ideas. Now it\u2019s a guide for how to politicize instruction and dumb down the curriculum. Just about every article mentions free choice as the standard \u2014 in other words, letting students read whatever they feel like instead of choosing works of substance for them. (Actual quote from a university instructor: \u201cWhy do we think The Great Gatsby is great when Superman has been around for almost as long?\u201d) Sorry, but there\u2019s no way I would have voluntarily picked up most of the classics that made me love literature \u2014 but having been assigned them in my courses, I discovered ideas and styles that stretched my perspective and challenged my intellect. Now the only leading we\u2019re encouraged to do is toward \u201cactivism and joy,\u201d in that order.\n\nI was planning to attend the annual convention this year, but at this point I can\u2019t see spending professional development funds on this hogwash. And this joke of a magazine is going straight to the recycle bin.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image1-1-e1569863285231.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
