And we find ourselves wondering what thoughts are whirring inside the head of the Brexit Brain Egg himself, as he skulks his grey tracksuited way around the conference bars and hotels and fringe events, the anti-establishment man that accidentally found himself running the establishment.\n\nAs he knows, when you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing, and what his government is finding itself having to explain, rightly or wrongly, is that his own wife has never been groped by the prime minister.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

An official statement, released by Dominic Cummings\u2019s wife, Mary Wakefield, who is commissioning editor of The Spectator magazine, to put on record that Boris Johnson definitely did not once grope her.\n\nUnfortunately for Dominic Cummings, groping is the story that just will not go away. They\u2019ve thrown everything at it but it\u2019s just not working.\n\nThe housing minister, Esther McVey, has announced bold new plans about building \u201c3D houses\u201d on \u201c3D computers\u201d but even that isn\u2019t moving attention elsewhere.\n\nThey\u2019ve told some of the worst jokes that have ever been told. An MP called Jake Berry has genuinely said these words, in public, on film: \u201cThe only homes we are not going to build in the north of England is Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\n\nThat really has happened.\n\nBut it\u2019s still not done the job.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the bit that really doesn\u2019t make sense. Boris Johnson has officially denied the allegations, made in The Sunday Times by the journalist Charlotte Edwardes, that around 20 years ago, he grabbed her inner thigh under the table in The Spectator\u2019s office.\n\nHe has made it a case of her word against his. She, a journalist of impeccable reputation. He a proven liar, sacked twice for lying, and whom, well, if he told you it was Wednesday, you\u2019d check.\n\nWho you choose to believe is, of course, up to you. But here are just a few of the friendly thoughts, sent to Edwardes on Twitter, in the hours after the prime minister decided to let the public decide who was a liar, he or her:\n\n\u201cBoris is way out of your league!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho would want to put their hand up your thigh? Nobody\u2019s that desperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory is littered with dregs trying to score for money and fame by kiss \u2018n\u2019 telling and soon they\u2019ll be forgotten.\u201d\n\nWhat people. What times.\n\nOut on the distant fringes of Tory conference, life is carrying on as what counts as normal in this through-the-looking-glass world.\n\nNaturally, the cap is duly doffed to whoever\u2019s idea it was to hold the panel featuring John Redwood, Arlene Foster and Mark Francois on stage at the Comedy Store. Our headliners did not disappoint.\n\nJohn Redwood is furious that Brexit hasn\u2019t been got on with. \u201cCome the election, I wouldn\u2019t want to be an MP who had broken his promise to help us leave the European Union,\u201d he said. John Redwood, you won\u2019t need reminding, has voted to keep Britain in the European Union three times, by voting against Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement.\n\nThere is a hell of a lot of this stuff doing the rounds. You cannot move in Manchester without encountering the words, \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d. The whole occasion is fuelled by the ever growing fury of Brexit paralysis, and no one is more powered up by it than the paralysers themselves.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t make it up. You really couldn\u2019t. You also couldn\u2019t make up that Mark Francois is writing a book called You Couldn\u2019t Make It Up. Out next summer.\n\nHe also revealed that he hasn\u2019t bought David Cameron\u2019s book because he went to the index, looked under F, and \u201cmy name wasn\u2019t there. So David can keep his 25 quid\u201d.\n\nSomeone really should break it to Mr Francois that this is not how the publishing market works. You do not receive the cover price from everybody who chooses not to buy it. It certainly cannot be ruled out that Mr Francois thinks he\u2019s on to a canny ruse. When the entire population of the world without exception, fails to purchase You Couldn\u2019t Make It Up by Mark Francois (retail price, \u00a31), he may genuinely be expecting to receive a \u00a37bn royalty cheque.\n\nYou Couldn\u2019t Make It Up. Really, you couldn\u2019t. So don\u2019t even bother trying.", "description": "The main reason the genius Dominic Cummings is universally acknowledged to be a genius is his thrilling innovation, dreamt up with the help of a large red bus with a lie down the side, that in modern politics, you\u2019re far better off winding up your opponent with calculated fibs than you are telling the truth.
