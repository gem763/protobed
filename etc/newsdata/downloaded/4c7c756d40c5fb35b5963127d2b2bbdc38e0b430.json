The leaks and rumours have already begun, with Google even releasing its own image ina baller power move earlier this year. But there have been some updates since then, including some pretty massive spec leaks. Here's everything we know so far. Read more\n\nAccording to 9to5Google there will be three Google Pixel 4 colours to choose from - Clearly White, Just Black and Oh So Orange.\n\nWhile this info comes from an unnamed source, just about everything else about the phone has leaked so far. We wouldn't be surprised if its legit. And Google even revealed the orange device itself in Times Square just last week.\n\nIf the plethora of other rumours are to be believed, there will two Pixel 4 models (as per usual) - a 5.7-inch Pixel 4 with a 2160 x 1080 HD+ OLED display and 6.3-inch Pixel 4 XL a 2960 x 1440. QHD+ OLED display. Both phones will have a new Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB RAM and 64GB/128GB storage options.\n\nInterestingly, leaks have suggested that the Pixel 4 will only have a 2,800mAH battery, which is a downgrade from the 2,915mAH battery in the Pixel 3. Of course, there are other things that contribute to battery life, including more aggressive management systems, but it still seems odd.\n\nOn the camera front the Pixel 4 is rumoured to have a dual rear setup, with both a 12MP regular and 16MP telephoto lens. We're not sure about the front-facing camera as yet.\n\nWhile we don't know which models and variations will be coming to Australia as yet (we didn't get the Purple-ish version of the Google Pixel 3a) our fingers are crossed for Oh So Orange.\n\nWhile the pastel tones of previous generations have been lovely, the prospect of a more vibrant pixel is exciting. Even if it ends up being reminiscent of a Sherbie as opposed to an actual orange, we're here for it.\n\n[9to5Google]", "description": "Google loves slapping cheeky colour names on its Pixel phones.
