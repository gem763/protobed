For a really good office chair you want to consider form, fit \u2013 and fashion.\n\nFor more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.\n\nA good ergonomic office chair will set you back about R6,000 \u2013 and at the top end you could pay R24,000 for just one chair.\n\nAnd there are powerful reasons to do that.\n\nBack pain kills productivity, partly because of the constant discomfort but mainly because of the compelling work-avoidance strategies your subconscious will employ to keep you away from your desk. We'd argue that a good \u2013 and exorbitantly expensive \u2013 ergonomic desk chair can pay for itself because it helps you to slip into the zone, then lets you stay there until you're rich again.\n\nCost aside, the problem with ergonomic chairs is that they're very difficult to find in South Africa \u2013 especially if you want to try before you buy. Also, local distributors don't advertise their prices. You have to ask for a quote, which can be annoying in today's one-click culture. Still, it's probably good to have a barrier to impulse-buying, considering the prices in play. And it also means there might be room for a bit of bargaining.\n\nWe tested four of the best ergonomic desk chairs in South Africa. Here's what we found.\n\nSteelcase Series 1: R6,000*\n\nThe Series 1 is the entry-level option from Steelcase, which you can pick up for about R6,000* from Inspiration Office. It is decent, with a breathable mesh back that will hug you tight with all its might.\n\nThe arms adjust every which way, and there is an optional-extra headrest, which is the big drawing card for Steelcase.\n\nBut entry level is just that, and there's better up the cost ladder.\n\nSteelcase Gesture: R19,000*\n\nWhere the Series 1 is a good chair with a headrest, the Steelcase Gesture \u2013 at around R19,000* \u2013 is on another level. It is a sexy, adjustable full-tilter that lets you switch easily from leaning in towards your desk to kicking back into a deep recline that is perfect for naps.\n\nThis is a trap, however. If you nap the Gesture will not pay for itself.\n\nHerman Miller Aeron: R12,000*\n\nHerman Miller does not do head rests. Something to do with blood flow; we glazed over when the sales guy explained why.\n\nBut what it does do is damn fine chairs. It's best known for the Aeron, the gold standard for ergonomic office chairs since 1992 - for good reason: it\u2019s a superb chair, with plenty of adjustment options to keep your back and bottom happy during long-haul work binges.\n\nThe Aeron starts at around R12,000* from AllOffice.\n\nBut we're not looking for the standard. Only the best will do.\n\nHerman Miller Cosm: R24,000*\n\nIt tops out at about R24,000, but right now that buys you the absolute very best in ergonomic office chairs: Herman Miller's Cosm line\n\nIt's a new and weird design that launched a year ago, its weirdness perhaps most starkly evident in the \u201cleaf\u201d elbow rests, Herman Miller\u2019s recommended option in place of regular arms.\n\nAnd it doesn't have adjustment options. Its entire purpose is to adjust itself to you - or perhaps to adjust you to it. Whatever: it doesn't have knobs or levers.\n\n\n\nWhat it does have is the most incredible lower back support we have ever experienced. Your mileage may vary, of course, but when its fine suspension mesh moulds itself firmly to your contours don't be surprised if you start to get a bit weepy. Especially if you're trying it out knowing you can't afford its admittedly staggering price tag.\n\nBut like we said, a good ergonomic desk chair pays for itself. Not upfront, alas, but at least you'll get where you're going without having to busting your ass - or your back. If you can afford it, get the Cosm. It will make you money. Maybe.\n\n* These were prices quoted to us in person on the showroom floor, but they may vary according to customisable options, specials, the weather, the salesperson\u2019s mood, or the number of units ordered; we understand bulk orders can result in discounts of as much as 20%.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Good ergonomic desk chairs start expensive, and go up from there.
