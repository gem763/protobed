Constantinople will carry 52.5kg (116 pounds) in \u201cthe race that stops a nation\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the Post, Moreira said the Melbourne Cup was the race he wanted \u201cto win the most\u201d after falling agonisingly short in 2016 on Heartbreak City.\n\n\u201cI have done one of my best rides ever in this race and it is the race I want to win the most. It is a race that I have been going there for a while now so hopefully it might be the time,\u201d Moreira said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I have my feet firmly on the ground and understand that Glen could well appeal and his appeal could have him stay on the horse.\n\n\u201cGlen is a good friend of mine, I wish him nothing but the best, I hope he can find a way to get around all of this so I wish him well.\u201d\n\nAfter being \u201cheartbroken\u201d by Heartbreak City\u2019s second placing in 2016, Moreira suffered a fall in a race just before the Cup in 2017, ruling him out of the Group One.\n\n\u201cI was very unlucky, a few races before the Cup I was involved in an accident which traumatised me a little bit to be honest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou go all the way over there to have your chance in the Melbourne Cup and then you end up not being able to make it because of the accident, I was so disappointed for the connections who went to so much effort to get me over there, I let them down.\n\n\u201cNow is a new chapter and who knows? It might be my time, it might not be, Glen might still stay on the horse.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong-bound Hayes bought a significant share in Constantinople to bring him to Australia after the horse won two races under legendary trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien.\n\nMoreira last combined with Hayes 18 months ago, winning the Group Two Arrowfield Sprint (1,200m) aboard Catchy in Sydney.\n\nWhyte brings the Thunder\n\nJockey-turned-trainer Douglas Whyte was robbed of two wins aboard Chater Thunder two seasons ago, but got one back at Sha Tin on Sunday.\n\nThe 13-time champion jockey had done all the legwork with the former David Ferraris-trained galloper before a victory on the all-weather surface in 2018 but was unable to ride the then four-year-old due to suspension.\n\nThe French-bred galloper had shown no form in Hong Kong before Whyte advised Ferraris to run Chater Thunder on the all-weather surface.\n\n\u201cHe is a horse that I have been associated with, I rode him in his first couple of starts in a race and I gave my opinion that he would handle the dirt, and we put blinkers on him,\u201d Whyte said. \u201cOnly thing is I unfortunately got suspended that day and [Alexis] Badel picked up the ride and won on him.\u201d\n\nBadel went on to win once more on the horse in what was his last victory before Sunday\u2019s breakthrough.\n\n\u201cHe has been a work in progress, he had his fair share of problems back in the stables and it has taken a bit of patching up to get him right,\u201d Whyte said.\n\n\u201cSo he is a horse I have had a bit to do with, it is very satisfying to get a horse like him to want to put his head out.\u201d\n\nAlmond catches the Eye\n\nThe breathtaking performance of Japanese filly Almond Eye in the Group One Tenno Sho Autumn (2,000m) sure caught the attention of many in Hong Kong.\n\nThe superstar four-year-old is nominated for the Group One Hong Kong Cup (2,000m) and is a live chance of coming for the HK$28 million feature if her connections elect to bypass next month\u2019s Group One Japan Cup (2,400m).\n\nHong Kong could make the perfect meeting point for Saturday\u2019s Group One Cox Plate (2,040m) winner Lys Gracieux as well, with the mare nominated for both the Cup (2,000m) and Vase (2,400m).\n\nThe two-time Hong Kong placegetter will be forced to return to Japan for quarantine requirements before a decision can be made on a possible trip to Hong Kong.\n\nTrainer Caspar Fownes joked he would like to see Almond Eye steer clear of Hong Kong with his up-and-comer Rise High on a path to the Hong Kong Cup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always known she\u2019s [Almond Eye] a superstar \u2013 she\u2019s the real deal. Hopefully they\u2019ll go to the Japan Cup. I\u2019ll send them a message \u2018why would you take the chance of travelling her?\u2019,\u201d he laughed.\n\nShinn secures first Sha Tin winner\n\nAustralian jockey Blake Shinn had two Hong Kong winners on his resume this season but there was a glaring omission before Sunday\u2019s meeting \u2013 one at Sha Tin.\n\nThe Australian righted that wrong in the very last fixture of the all-weather track meeting in the Class Three Guangzhou Handicap (1,200m) aboard Seven Heavens and his delight was there for all to see.\n\nShinn has not been short on opportunities in Hong Kong and has been knocking on the door for some time and trainer Caspar Fownes could not have been more delighted that he was able to get the job done for one of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest owners, the Siu family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great for Blake, I\u2019m very happy for the owners, they\u2019ve been very good supporters to me and we\u2019ve just had a little bit of bad luck in recent times, but it\u2019s the racing game, everything turns around and hopefully that\u2019s the start of it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve bought a nice horse for them in the summer [Arrogant], he had a little bit of a setback but he\u2019s over it now, and hopefully we can go forward and get him to the Derby.\u201d\n\nSanna off to a strong start\n\nJockey Alberto Sanna must hardly know himself at the moment with the in-form jockey enjoying his best start to a Hong Kong season.\n\nThe Italian only managed six winners in an injury-interrupted campaign last term but has already matched that figure just 14 meetings in this time around.\n\nSanna, known for his willingness to put in the hard yards, has struck up a winning combination with new trainer Douglas Whyte, with the pair combining for four of his wins, including Chater Thunder on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling. Riding winners makes you ride better and with more confidence,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working hard in the mornings and it\u2019s good because I\u2019m getting the support. Two winners on Wednesday, a winner today \u2013 it makes you work harder to find better rides in the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proving and the people can see that I am able to ride winners and I am able to ride well.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong superstar Joao Moreira is daring to dream of Melbourne Cup glory after getting a standby call-up to ride favourite Constantinople....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/27/93b88c66-f7dd-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_214047.JPG?itok=zlP1GqfF&v=1572183660", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
