The signed pledge also binds candidates to publicly call on their supporters not to launch outside groups on their behalf.\n\nIt's an enormous change for the party, one that will likely strengthen the DNC and state parties after what many Democrats considered neglect of the party infrastructure during the Obama years. It also throws into question the future of Our Revolution, the Bernie Sanders-created grass-roots organization, which state party leaders say would appear to violate the agreement if Sanders wins the general election.\n\n\u201cIt's a huge shift,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party. The move sends two messages, she added: \"You cannot create another OFA,\" and \"the DNC is an important national infrastructure, but it's not in the states \u2014 we are.\u201d\n\n\u201c[State parties] are never the shiny object that gets funded with all the appeals from podcasts or big donors,\u201d Kleeb added.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

It was a move that many state party chairs loathed, and in the years since have faulted for Democrats' losses at the gubernatorial and statehouse level.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't helpful to the political work that needs to get done in building a bench,\u201d said Stephen Handwerk, executive director of the Louisiana Democratic Party. \"We have a political tool in the state parties and the president should use them.\"\n\nThe pledge, signed by Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and 16 other contenders, requires candidates to use state parties as their organizing, messaging and political arm should they become their party's nominee. Many state parties are run by full-time and unpaid chairs who are expected to recruit, train and get candidates elected. But many have few resources at their disposal, and the deal announced Tuesday is an attempt to fix that.\n\nThe agreement also mandates the eventual nominee to share all of the data he or she collects during the campaign with the DNC and state parties, which is already a requirement to get access to the party's voter file. The new agreement doesn\u2019t require the nominee to share his or her email list, a notable concession and one that party officials hope could be revisited.\n\nHarris was the first leading candidate to sign the pledge, drafted by the Association of State Democratic Committees, according to multiple sources. Warren had already signaled that she wanted to operate within the existing party infrastructure, donating $5,000 to each of the 50 state parties last year.\n\nBut Our Revolution was a point of contention during discussions with the Sanders campaign, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Sanders has long identified as an independent in the Senate, though he caucuses with Democrats. He is a self-described democratic socialist.\n\nIt's uncertain what the agreement will mean for organizations like Our Revolution and Next Gen, an outside political group formed by billionaire Tom Steyer, who's now running for president.\n\n\u201cWe can't have competing centers of gravity as we move forward,\u201d said Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and president of the state Democratic committees. \u201cWe've learned the lessons of the past.\"\n\n\u201cIf Sen. Sanders is the president, he would put his energy and political capital into the Democratic Party,\u201d Martin added.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign argued that Our Revolution could remain in operation because the group already acts and operates \u201cindependently\u201d from the Vermont senator. Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders, said outside groups such as Move On, Progressive Change Campaign Committee or Third Way would likewise not be affected by the pledge.\n\nSen.

Is PCCC going to go away? These groups will all continue to exist,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cJoe Biden is not going to shut down Third Way\u201d if he becomes president because he doesn\u2019t control it.\n\nDuring his campaign, Sanders has promised to pursue change with a mass movement of workers if elected president. Weaver said the pledge will have no effect on Sanders\u2019 ability to rally supporters.\n\n\"There\u2019s no reason the Democratic Party can\u2019t be the vehicle to bring 1 million people to the [Washington Mall] to fight for single-payer,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIn fact, they should be.\u201d\n\nBut others disagreed with Weaver's interpretation. The centrist Third Way wasn\u2019t created by Biden, and PCCC and MoveOn similarly weren\u2019t founded by a current presidential candidate.\n\nOur Revolution, by contrast, is a creation of Sanders and his political operation. Nina Turner, the co-chair of Sanders\u2019 campaign, was previously president of Our Revolution, and the group had access to Sanders' massive email list when it formed.\n\nEven Kleeb, who serves on the board of Our Revolution, said the organization would need to substantially change.\n\n\u201cIf Sen. Sanders becomes the nominee and the president, I do think that Our Revolution would have to shutter or really focus only on local candidates,\u201d Kleeb said. \u201cBut Our Revolution would have to really shift its message.\u201d\n\nThough Sanders is not involved in Our Revolution's operations, a legal line the organization follows, the current goal of Our Revolution is to reform the party by getting people elected to the DNC and state parties. The portion of the organization dedicated to that \u201cwould have to end,\u201d Kleeb said.\n\n", "description": "The 2020 field pledges not to form a separate political arm from the DNC.", "authors": ["Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez", "Alex Thompson", "Holly Otterbein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/69/a72e7dd24489be8acf3e2874ff54/190827-barack-obama-ap-773.jpg"}
