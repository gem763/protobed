Maybe you should get off your phone and give them your attention.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nTracy tried to explain what she was doing and it wasn't until she got home that she began to think about what she wished she had really said to him, as reported by The Sun .\n\nWriting on the Breastfeeding Mama Talk Facebook group in a post which received a huge response, she said: \"First of all, I had no idea the toddler saying \u2018mama pizza, mama pizza\u2019 over and over and the baby making pre-cry warnings to alert me that if we don\u2019t move soon he\u2019s going to lose it wanted my attention.\n\n\"Thank you for that brilliant analysis of the situation.\"\n\nShe describes how the trio had already been in the queue for 15 minutes, during which time she had already pulled out books, snacks and games in an attempt to keep the little ones entertained.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nShe also points out that the man must have been in the line next to them for a total of two minutes or he would have also witnessed the smiles, laughs and interactions which were happening just seconds before.\n\nTracy continued: \u201cThank you for your parenting advice. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to shame a young mother with two tiny children. Thank you for seeing a stressful moment and deciding \u2018I think I\u2019ll make this worse for her\u2019.\n\n\"Everyone, if you see a mother (or father) with young children out in public anywhere, assume she is stressed out. Assume she is trying her damndest to get through the situation.\"\n\nThe powerful post quickly struck a chord with other parents who recognised what had happened to the young mum.\n\nOne wrote: \"Yes yes yes! Wish you had time to break it down like that for the 'bigger baby' that felt the need to lecture you.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I would have asked him if that was why he was also making a fuss. Does he need attention too? Mind ya business!\"\n\nHave you ever been parent shamed by a stranger?
