Three Republicans have announced their candidacy to challenge Trump in the party\u2019s nominating contest.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s blog post did not identify the election campaign whose network was targeted by Phosphorous hackers, but sources told Reuters the target was Trump\u2019s re-election effort.\n\nThe FBI did declined to comment.\n\nChris Krebs, director of the Homeland Security Department\u2019s election security division, known as CISA, said he was aware of the Microsoft report. In a statement, Krebs called it \u201cyet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions.\u201d\n\nHacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Moscow has denied any meddling.\n\nTensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018, when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated U.S. sanctions, increasing pressure on the Iranian economy, including its oil trade.\n\nThe Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft\u2019s statement.\n\nJohn Hultquist, director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc, said the particular Iranian group named in the attempts had been conducting \u201chigh-volume operations\u201d aimed at harvesting credentials for online accounts.\n\nPhosphorus is also known by APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.\n\nThe attacks were not technically sophisticated, Microsoft said.\n\n\u201cThis effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering,\u201d the blog said.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show that the Trump campaign has spent tens of thousands of dollars on Microsoft products and software.\n\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and said in March that it had received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to execute attacks bit.ly/2TDKee1.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a Trump 2020 re-election campaign rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, U.S. May 20, 2019.
