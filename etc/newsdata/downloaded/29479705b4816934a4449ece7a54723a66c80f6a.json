Trump on Monday defended the decision, saying he was fulfilling a campaign promise to withdraw from \"endless war\" in the Middle East, and he warned Turkey that he would ruin its economy if any American personnel are harmed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump sent a series of tweets that stirred confusion about the U.S.-Turkey relationship. He sent tweets defending Ankara as a big trading partner of the U.S., supplier of steel for F-35 fighter jets.\n\n\"We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,\" Trump said. \"Likewise our relationship with Turkey, a NATO and Trading partner, has been very good.\n\n\"Turkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!\"\n\nTrump said he would welcome Erdogan to the White House on Nov. 13.\n\nOn Monday, two senior State Department officials made a point of noting that while the Turks had highlighted the invitation in their readout of the call, the previous night's White House statement had not included any reference to an Erdogan visit to Washington. They said the Turkish readout was not incorrect but suggested that the omission of the trip from the White House statement was an indication of Trump's unhappiness with Erdogan's plans for an operation against the Kurds.\n\nTurkey's vice president says his country won't bow to threats in an apparent response to Trump's warning to Ankara about the scope of its planned military incursion into Syria.\n\nFuat Oktay said in a speech on Tuesday that Turkey is intent on combatting Syrian Kurdish fighters across its border in Syria and on creating a zone that would allow Turkey to resettle Syrian refugees there.\n\nOktay said: \"Where Turkey's security is concerned, we determine our own path but we set our own limits.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
