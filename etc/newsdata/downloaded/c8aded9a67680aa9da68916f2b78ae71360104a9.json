He just wants to give up, he doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore. What do you do, as a mum?\u201d\n\nBOY, 12, SURVIVES 'FREAK' TRAMPOLINE ACCIDENT AFTER METAL SPRING SHOT INTO HIS BACK 'LIKE A BULLET'\n\nWilliams\u2019s son, Rhys, was born with epidermolysis bullosa, a group of rare diseases that causes fragile, blistering skin that appears in response to minor injury including rubbing, scratching, or even adhesive tape. In severe cases, individuals may experience blisters inside the body, including the lining of the mouth or stomach.\n\nMost types of epidermolysis bullosa, sometimes referred to as \u201cbutterfly skin,\u201d are inherited, according to the Mayo Clinic. There is no cure, although mild forms may improve with age. Treatment typically focuses on caring for blisters and preventing new ones.\n\nSevere forms of epidermolysis bullosa may cause fusion of fingers or toes, or abnormal bending of joints that can occur at the fingers, knees and elbows. Patients may have difficulty passing stool due to blisters, may experience dental problems, are at risk of infection and sepsis, and high risk of skin cancer. Infants with a severe form of the disorder are at an increased risk of death due to loss of body fluids, widespread blistering and issues breathing.\n\nRAW BEEF RECALLED, DEEMED 'UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION'\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a happy boy most of the time but recently it\u2019s a struggle to try and get through to him,\u201d Williams told SWNS of her 13-year-old son. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can fight much longer, his life depends on this.\u201d\n\nRhys, who turns 14 later this month and is into Xbox, now relies on a wheelchair because he is unable to straighten his legs. Williams said they change his bandages up to three times a day, and his fingers have become webbed, rendering him unable to play outside with friends and reliant on morphine for pain.\n\nWilliams said she got the idea to ask for birthday cards to be sent to him after seeing how well he reacted to a similar campaign during Christmas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cEvery single card he received, he opened them with so much joy,\u201d she told SWNS. \u201cHe came home from school and he would see these Christmas cards. He got hundreds at a time. It showed him that he still needs to fight, that there\u2019s people out there who do care and do love him. Hopefully, it can make him see that not everything is bad.\u201d\n\nFor information on how to send Rhys a birthday card, click here.", "description": "She said she got the idea to ask for birthday cards after seeing how well he reacted to a similar campaign during Christmas.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/CARDS_SWNS.jpg"}
