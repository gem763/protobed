He would not specify how many survivors there were, but he said there were \u201cmore dead than alive.\"\n\nUS forces were in the compound for two hours and seized \u201chighly sensitive material and information\u201d on Isis, Trump said, signaling a major victory amid the president's controversial decision to order US retreat from northern Syria that allowed Turkish forces to attack the Kurds.\n\nSource: The White House, Business Insider", "description": "US President Donald Trump provided vivid detail of the mission that he said left the extremist leader \"whimpering and crying and screaming\" as he died.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2850/68dc24494e624de68c6dbab31a29c46d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
