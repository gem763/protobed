But the two great powers of the day, Britain and France, reneged in 1923 and carved up the Kurdish territories into modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nThe Kurds rebelled against this betrayal and were crushed by their new British, French, Iranian, and Turkish colonisers. After decades of relative quiet, the Kurds tried again to achieve autonomy in the aftermath of Iraq\u2019s 1958 revolution, which saw the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy.\n\nAfter the outbreak of war in Iraqi Kurdistan in September 1961, the US government adopted a policy of noninterference. The primary objective of US policy at the time was to maintain good relations with Baghdad, and there was always the nagging suspicion that the Kurdish rebel leader, Mustafa Barzani, was a communist agent, given his 11-year exile in the Soviet Union from 1947 to 1958.\n\nHowever, two close American allies in the region \u2013 Israel and Iran \u2013 quickly concluded that the Iraqi Kurds were ideological and strategic allies who could be exploited to keep the radical Arab nationalist regime in Baghdad \u2013 and its large military \u2013 tied down.\n\nThe Baath Party\n\nStarting in mid-1962, the Shah of Iran ordered his intelligence agency, SAVAK, to help finance the Kurdish insurgency in northern Iraq to undermine the stability of the regime in Baghdad. The Israelis joined the Iranian-led intervention in 1964, after Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion recognised the Kurds as a strategic ally against the radical Arab regime in Baghdad.\n\nFor the next decade, the Iranian and Israeli strategy was simple: As long as the Kurds presented a clear and present danger to Baghdad, the Iraqi military could not be deployed in force against Israel in the event of a war or threaten Iranian ambitions in the Persian Gulf. This paid off in 1967, when Iraq was unable to deploy its forces in the pan-Arab war against Israel, and in the successor war in 1973, when it could only muster a single armoured division because 80 percent of its military was tied down in northern Iraq.\n\nThe Americans were slower to come around. Since the mid-1960s, both the Iranians and Israelis had been seeking to convince the White House to reconsider its nonintervention policy; so had Iraqi Kurds, who regularly met with US foreign service officers. They were always greeted with a polite but firm refusal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis changed in July 1968 when the Baath Party \u2013 whose leadership included a young Saddam Hussein \u2013 seized power and firmly established itself as the dominant political force inside Iraq for the next 35 years. In March 1970, Saddam concluded that the war against his country\u2019s Kurds was a wasted effort and personally travelled north and met with Barzani.\n\nSaddam agreed to every demand, which centred on Kurdish autonomy within a unified Iraq, but indicated that the program would not be implemented until 1974. Essentially, the March accord bought time for both sides. Saddam was able to consolidate power, and Barzani was able to secure a powerful new ally \u2013 the US.\n\nNixon gives green light\n\nFollowing the March Accord, Saddam pulled Iraq firmly into the arms of the Soviets. In December 1971, Iraq signed an arms deal with Moscow, and in April 1972, it signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. The following month, Nixon visited Tehran on his return from a successful Moscow summit, where he managed to secure detente with the Soviets. During his visit, the shah pressed Nixon to assist the Kurds in destabilising Iraq.\n\nAfter a careful review of the risks, the Nixon administration concluded that the Soviet-Iraqi threat to Western interests was significant enough to justify helping the Kurds. Following Nixon\u2019s green light, the Kurdish operation was run out of Kissinger\u2019s White House office. Between August 1972 and late 1974, when fighting in the Iraqi-Kurdish war resumed, the Nixon administration frequently consulted with the Iranians, Israelis, and the Kurds on how to prepare them for an inevitable confrontation with Baghdad. This meant stockpiling weaponry and training Kurdish fighters on modern warfare techniques \u2013 all while relations between the Kurds and Baghdad deteriorated rapidly.\n\nIn early 1974, Saddam violated the terms of the March accord and unilaterally imposed a watered-down version of autonomy for the Kurds. Barzani responded by travelling to Iran, where he met with the shah and the CIA\u2019s station chief to request US backing for a plan to set up an Iraqi Arab-Kurdish government that would claim to be the sole legitimate government of Iraq. As Kissinger wrote in his 1999 memoir, Years of Renewal, Barzani\u2019s request \u201ctriggered a flood of communications\u201d among US officials focused on two questions: whether the US would support a unilateral declaration of autonomy and what level of support the US was willing to give the Kurds. The CIA, in particular, warned against increasing US assistance.\n\nKurds' geographic problem\n\nBut Kissinger was dismissive of CIA Director William Colby\u2019s caution, writing, \u201cColby\u2019s reluctance was as unrealistic as Barzani\u2019s enthusiasm.\u201d Nixon ultimately decided to increase US assistance to the Kurds, including the provision of 900,000 pounds of Soviet-made weapons that the CIA had stockpiled and a $US1 million ($1.48 million) lump sum of refugee assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 1974, Kissinger sent Nixon\u2019s orders to the US ambassador in Tehran. This cable was important because it laid out a succinct proclamation of US interests vis-\u00e0-vis the Kurds. The objectives, he wrote, were \u201c(a) to give Kurds capacity to maintain a reasonable base for negotiating recognition of rights by Baghdad Government; (b) to keep present Iraqi government tied down, but (c) not to divide Iraq permanently because an independent Kurdish area would not be economically viable and US and Iran have no interest in closing door on good relations with Iraq under moderate leadership.\u201d\n\nIt was also made clear that US support for a Kurdish government on a long-term basis was not possible because it could not be kept covert and there were deep concerns within the US government about the viability of a Kurdish state, not to mention the shah\u2019s own concerns about Kurdish independence, given Iran\u2019s large Kurdish minority. This point was conveyed to the Kurds at the beginning of their relationship with the US and was reiterated throughout the Kurdish operation.\n\nThis sheds light on the basic problem that the Kurds have always faced, which is geographic. An independent Kurdistan is certain to be landlocked, rendering it unable to participate in the international economy without being reliant on external \u2013 and hostile \u2013 powers such as Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. For example, if the Kurds wanted to export oil or natural gas, it would have to traverse neighbouring territory via a pipeline to reach international markets. If none of these countries agreed, then the Kurdish economy would be doomed.\n\nEven basic services like air travel would be reliant on external patrons because Kurdistan-bound flights would have to travel through the airspace of hostile countries \u2013 countries that already have relationships with the US. That\u2019s why, despite a deep affinity for the Kurds and their cause, the US has always been clear \u2013 to itself, if not always in public \u2013 about its reluctance to support Kurdish independence.\n\n'No guts left'\n\nIn late 1974, the Iraqi Army launched an all-out offensive against the Kurds, making deep gains in the mountains, thanks to the close guidance of Soviet military advisors. But, despite considerable Iranian and Israeli efforts to bolster the Kurds militarily, the Iraqis managed to hold ground in the winter of 1974-1975. This prompted Kissinger and the Israelis to devise a plan to provide the Kurds with $US28 million worth of arms.\n\nBut it was too late \u2013 the geopolitics had shifted from underneath the Kurds. On February 18, 1975, the shah met with Kissinger in Zurich. He informed Kissinger that the Kurds had \u201cno guts left\u201d and was thinking about meeting with Saddam at an OPEC conference in March to see if he could trade his support for a border concession. Kissinger claimed in his 1999 memoir that he argued against the shah\u2019s proposal and reminded him of \u201chis own repeated warnings that the collapse of the Kurds would destabilise the entire area.\u201d\n\nNone of this mattered. Iran\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurds was presented to the US as a fait accompli, a done deal. On March 6, the shah and Saddam announced the Algiers Agreement, which exchanged partial sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway, a strategic waterway along the Iran-Iraq border, in return for noninterference in each other\u2019s affairs. The Kurdish intervention was doomed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shah ordered the closing of Iran\u2019s border with Iraq, effectively throwing the Kurds to the wolves. With the border closed, the Americans and Israelis were incapable of providing the Kurds with ongoing assistance. The next day, the Iraqis then unleashed the full weight of their military against the Kurds, forcing thousands of civilians to flee to Iran. The CIA officers and Israeli special forces who had been helping their Kurdish allies fight the Iraqis were stunned.\n\nBetrayal is no a shock\n\nSo was Kissinger, who had spent the better part of three years working tirelessly to give the Kurds a fighting chance. There was nothing that could have been done to prevent the slaughter. With Iran now cut off, there was no avenue to continue providing American assistance. Saddam\u2019s forces overran the Kurds, razed 1,400 villages to the ground, rounded up thousands of Barzani\u2019s followers, and imposed his rule on the region.\n\nThis tragic end of the American intervention to support the Kurds would mark the beginning of the back-and-forth relationship between the US and the Kurds that still exists today. Thousands of Kurds in Iraq lost their lives after the US, Iran, and Israel rescinded their support in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Kurds and the US found themselves on opposite sides of the Iran-Iraq War, which saw Saddam regularly using chemical weapons against both Iran and the Kurds and led to widespread genocide in Iraqi Kurdistan. The tides would turn again in the early 1990s. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the US urged the Kurds to revolt against Saddam\u2019s government, only for the George H.W. Bush administration to abandon them in their time of need.\n\nIn April 1991, the White House realised its mistake and implemented Operation Provide Comfort, which established a no-fly zone over northern Iraq and allowed the Iraqi Kurds to finally live in peace. In 1992, the Iraqi Kurds established the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, which became an indispensable American ally during the Iraq War and the war against the Islamic State.\n\nIt seemed that the US had finally righted the wrong that it inflicted in 1975 \u2013 until now. But even this latest betrayal shouldn\u2019t come as a shock. It\u2019s entirely consistent with the interests toward the Kurds that the US has privately described from the very beginning.", "description": "The seeds of Washington\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds traces back to a classified document written in the 1970s by Henry Kissinger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6931%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_191%2C$y_44/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fe6216e4db8b65292bcf2d07dc0017416d9af4b3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
