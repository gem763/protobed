He was 95.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe addresses the Inaugural Session of the World Summit On Information Society in Geneva, Switzerland December 10, 2003. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nHe was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of his continent, a giant of Africa\u2019s liberation struggle against colonialism, whose rule finally ended in ignominy when he was overthrown by his own army.\n\n\u201cIt is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe\u2019s founding father and former President, Cde (Comrade) Robert Mugabe,\u201d a post on President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s official Twitter account said.\n\nTributes poured in from African leaders. The South African government sent condolences on the death of a \u201cfearless pan-Africanist liberation fighter\u201d. Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta mourned a \u201cman of courage who was never afraid to fight for what he believed in even when it was not popular.\u201d\n\nAt home, even his foes paid their respects.\n\n\u201cHe was a colossus on the Zimbabwean stage and his enduring positive legacy will be his role in ending white minority rule & expanding a quality education to all Zimbabweans,\u201d tweeted David Coltart, an opposition senator and rights lawyer.\n\nMugabe died in Singapore, where he has often received medical treatment in recent years. In November, Mnangagwa had said Mugabe was no longer able to walk when he had been admitted to a hospital in Singapore, without saying what ailed him.\n\nCHAMPION OF RECONCILIATION WHO UNLEASHED DEATH SQUADS\n\nMugabe was feted as a champion of racial reconciliation when he first came to power in a nation divided by nearly a century of white colonial rule.\n\nNearly four decades later, many at home and abroad denounced him as a power-obsessed autocrat willing to unleash death squads, rig elections and trash the economy in the relentless pursuit of control.\n\nWhen he was ousted by his own armed forces in November 2017, his resignation triggered wild celebrations across the country of 13 million. For Mugabe, it was an \u201cunconstitutional and humiliating\u201d act of betrayal by his party and people.\n\nConfined for the remaining years of his life between Singapore and his sprawling \u201cBlue Roof\u201d mansion in Harare, Mugabe stayed bitter to the end. Last year, before the first election without him, he said he would vote for the opposition.\n\nMugabe took power in 1980 after seven years of a liberation bush war, with a reputation as \u201cthe thinking man\u2019s guerrilla\u201d. He held seven degrees, three earned behind bars as a political prisoner of then-Rhodesia\u2019s white minority rulers.\n\nLater, as he crushed his political enemies, he boasted of another qualification: \u201ca degree in violence\u201d.\n\nIn fiery speeches throughout his rule he painted his actions as a just response to a racist colonial legacy that concentrated wealth in white hands. But when his followers seized white-owned farms, output cratered and southern Africa\u2019s breadbasket could barely feed itself. He blamed a conspiracy by a hostile West.\n\nAs the economy imploded starting from 2000 and his health eroded, he found fewer people to trust as he seemingly smoothed a path to succession for his wife, four decades his junior and derided by critics as \u201cGucci Grace\u201d for her luxury lifestyle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife,\u201d Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe\u2019s influential liberation war veterans, told Reuters after Mugabe\u2019s removal.\n\nBorn on Feb. 21, 1924, on a Roman Catholic mission near Harare, Mugabe was educated by Jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to South Africa\u2019s University of Fort Hare, then a breeding ground for African nationalism.\n\nReturning to then-Rhodesia in 1960, he entered politics and was jailed four years later for a decade for opposing white rule. When his infant son died of malaria in Ghana in 1966, Mugabe was denied parole to attend the funeral, a decision that historians say added to Mugabe\u2019s subsequent bitterness.\n\nAfter his release, he rose to the top of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army guerrilla movement, becoming prime minister and then president after the war.\n\n\u201cYou have inherited a jewel in Africa. Don\u2019t tarnish it,\u201d Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere told him during the independence celebrations in Harare.\n\nHis departure from power failed to lift Zimbabwe\u2019s economy, however, which remains in its worst economic crisis in a decade. Triple-digit inflation, rolling power cuts and shortages of U.S. dollars and basic goods have revived memories of the hyperinflation that forced it to ditch its currency in 2009.", "description": "Robert Mugabe, the bush war guerrilla leader who led Zimbabwe to independence in 1980 and crushed his foes during nearly four decades of rule as his country descended into poverty, hyperinflation and unrest, died on Friday.
