REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe U.S. government on Monday widened its trade blacklist to include Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision (002415.SZ) and surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology (002236.SZ) among others, drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nSouring the mood further was a South China Morning Post report here that said China had toned down its expectations ahead of the talks and that the Chinese delegation could depart Washington a day earlier than planned.\n\nThe U.S. action pressured suppliers to the Chinese firms. Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) fell about 1% in premarket trading, while Ambarella Inc (AMBA.O) slumped 10%.\n\nDow .DJI heavyweight Boeing Co (BA.N) fell 1.5% after the Wall Street Journal reported friction between the United States and Europe could further delay efforts to resume flights of the planemaker's best-selling 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded since early 2019.\n\nThe three main indexes logged their first fall in three sessions on Monday as investors tackled mixed headlines on U.S.-China trade. Risk appetite has also been hit by weak economic indicators last week and intensifying efforts to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nAt 7:10 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 192 points, or 0.73%. S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 20 points, or 0.68%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 55.25 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX is now about 3% off its record high hit in July.\n\nMarket participants will now turn their attention to the third-quarter earnings season beginning next week for evidence of the impact of the trade war on corporate America.\n\nAnalysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings from S&P 500 companies declining nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nAmong other stocks, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O) slid 7.1% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the drug developer\u2019s stock to \u201csell.\u201d\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks also declined, with Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N), JD.com Inc (JD.O) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) down between 1.6% and 3%.\n\nOn the data front, the Labor Department will release its report on producer price index (PPI), at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is expected to have remained at 0.1% last month.", "description": "Wall Street was headed for a second straight session of declines on Tuesday as an escalation in U.S.-China tensions tempered expectations from the high-level trade talks this week, while Boeing was hit by fresh concerns over its grounded 737 MAX jets.", "authors": ["Shreyashi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438429366&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970SF", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
