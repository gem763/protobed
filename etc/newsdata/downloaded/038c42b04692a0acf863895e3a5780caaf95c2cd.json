For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump was greeted with a thunderous chorus of boos from the sold-out crowd attendance at Game 5 of the World Series between the Nationals and Astros.\n\nTrump, who showed up shortly after the first inning, was introduced to the crowd after the third inning during the Nationals' salute to veterans, a regular feature at Nats\u2019 games.\n\nAs the next inning began, fans chanted \"lock him up,\" a nod to the motto that Trump supporters directed at Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nTrump and wife Melania sat in the Washington Suite and were joined by a number of other politicians including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Reps. Steve Scalise (R-La.), Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), among others.\n\nTrump did not sit with the Lerner family, the principal owners of the Nationals. A representative for the Lerner family put in a request to MLB to not be put in position to turn down a request from the White House to sit with Trump, according to WUSA.\n\nTrump has not attended a major league game since he took office in January 2017.\n\nTrump waves to the crowd during Game 5.
