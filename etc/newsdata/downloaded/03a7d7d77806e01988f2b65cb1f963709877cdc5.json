Let that sink in for a moment.\n\nThe excitement at home is building. I don't think anyone can sit still for too long, because things need to get done.\n\nNicolyn has started making alternative arrangements with some of our friends just in case I need to go to the hospital over a weekend and we need someone to look after Nikolai.\n\n'Full commander mode'\n\nSome of our family members are on standby to take me to the hospital if Nicolyn's at work. I guess you could say he's in full commander mode.\n\nI finally managed to convince Nikolai to interact with the babies and feel them kick and move. And he was super excited, asking me every now and then if he can feel them move again.\n\nI'm just not sure why he wasn't interested until now though\u2026maybe it was his way of processing the idea that he's getting three new siblings, or maybe he just wasn't interested.\n\nNetflix and naps\n\nMy maternity leave has officially started (whoop whoop). I can't tell you how relieved I am to be offline and not having to respond to e-mails.\n\nWithout feeling guilty, Netflix and naps now take up most of my daily routine.\n\nSeeing that I have so much time on my hands now, even if it's just for a couple of weeks, I'm planning to work on my thesis. The initial plan was to finish my studies this year, and I had every intention to.\n\nThe baby would be born in January 2020, and I would submit my thesis before then, right? But then baby decided to invite two extra siblings along on the journey, so my priorities had to shift a bit.\n\nAfter my first trimester symptoms kicked in, it threw me off track for months. So, I had to come up with a plan B. I will continue to work on my thesis and get as much done as I can. My race, my pace.\n\nAnd next year, I'll only have about two chapters left to finish. Hopefully, with my support structure at home, I can finish it in record time.\n\nLuckily, I have a supervisor that's really supportive and understanding.\n\nRenovation realness\n\nAlso, renovations at home are going extremely well. It's almost time for the windows to go in and the roof to go up.\n\nThis means Nicolyn and I have our work cut out for us. But this is also the most exciting part; choosing the floor tiles, kitchen design and the colour for the exterior of the house.\n\nAs for the babies' rooms, we're not in a rush to get their rooms done. We've decided that all three of them will sleep in our room for the first couple of months.\n\nWe're using Nikolai's sleigh cot, which I think will be big enough for all three for the time being. And as they grow, we'll add more cots to their room.\n\nNikolai was three months old when we moved him to his own room, and I think we'll do the same with our three little munchkins. That way we can get their rooms done timeously, while we decide on the colour, design and layout.\n\nI'm just super happy that most of the renovation work has been done as it wouldn't have been ideal to bring the babies home to all the dust and noise.\n\nHere's to 29 weeks of being pregnant! And let's hope these three are still comfortable enough to stay inside for just a little while longer.\n\nUntil next time!\n\nA-Bundlely Blessed and me.\n\n\"Triplets?!?\" Follow the A-Bundlely Blessed Diaries series here\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
