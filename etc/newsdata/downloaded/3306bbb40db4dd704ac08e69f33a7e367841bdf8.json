It was a stunning achievement, a feat of humanity that had for a long time seemed if not impossible then many, many decades away.\n\nThe effort required a lot of detailed planning, from the perfectly flat course to the favourable weather, and Kipchoge ran behind a well-orchestrated band of pacesetters swapping in and out of position to keep him on track. The fact that it was both pace-set and out-of-competition meant it was not an official world record.\n\nBut most controversial was his shoes: the Kenyan wore Nike Vaporfly trainers, a major innovation in the sport which has seen performances sharply improve. Here we take a look at exactly what all the fuss is about.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhat are Vaporflys and what makes them special?\n\nThey are a running shoe made by Nike that supposedly brings significant improvement to performance. Embedded in their thick foamy sole is a curved carbon-fibre plate which Nike research say give an improved metabolic efficiency of 4 per cent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Kipchoge broke the marathon world record wearing them while Abraham Kiptum broke the half-marathon world record too.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\nIn many ways there is no problem. Technological advances are a part of sport and always have been, and after all, Kipchoge\u2019s legs are still doing the running. But few innovations have such an instant impact on a sport as the Vaporfly has had on long distance running. Improved performance hasn\u2019t been incremental over decades but near instant, and it has brought into question whether a sporting ethical line has been crossed.\n\nCan a shoe really make that much difference?\n\nIt seems so. Independent studies agree with Nike\u2019s conclusion that they bring a significant advantage over a competitor wearing \u2018normal\u2019 shoes. What\u2019s more, Kipchoge\u2019s shoes were a bespoke design especially for him and his 1.59 challenge, so he may have had even more of an advantage than the original 4 per cent claim. Since the Vaporfly 4% edition, Nike have realised a ZoomX Vaporfly Next% version which is supposed to be even better. Running journalist Nick Harris-Fry recently told The Independent: \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed a lot of shoes and Vaporflys are the only ones that are obviously different \u2013 and better \u2013 to everything else.\u201d\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t every runner wear them?\n\nA lot of runners are now using them, although some cannot for sponsorship reasons. Even then, there was a case of a runner stitching another logo over the Nike swoosh so that he could run in the shoe in competition. For most of us they are still a little elusive though: at elite level they are made to measure, while on the open market they cost around \u00a3200.\n\nSo what now?\n\nRivals companies are desperate to match and even surpass Nike\u2019s invention, and Nike are investing heavily to improve what they\u2019ve already got, so this is unlikely to be the end of the story. It is likely to mean faster times, more records and that will bring even more questions. But until someone puts a wheel or a jet-pack in their heels, the IAAF is unlikely to intervene, and the issue will rumble on.", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge broke down one of sport\u2019s great barriers on Saturday when he ran the marathon in less than two hours.
