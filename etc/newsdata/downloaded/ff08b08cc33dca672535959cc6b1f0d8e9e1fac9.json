He had a huge heart and the biggest smile I have ever seen.\n\n'I have never known a giggle like it. We watch videos now and hear it and it still makes me smile. He is missed beyond measure.'\n\nAustin died after suffering acute asphyxiation, on November 23 last year\n\nMr Hardman added: 'Myself and Emma were just blessed to have such a perfect little boy. It is too short, but we were absolutely blessed by a little boy as beautiful as him. I just hope that nobody else ever has to go through this again.'\n\nCoroner James Thompson praised ambulance staff and doctors who had tried to save Austin's life.\n\nIn a statement read to the hearing, Mr Hardman said the family had planned to have a movie night with pizza and popcorn, as they always did on Fridays.\n\nHe said: 'We had a pizza delivered. Austin was going through a fussy phase and didn't want to eat any pizza, so I gave him some sugar snap pea pods. He had a really good appetite and he didn't want to be left out.\n\n'Austin started coughing I thought he had put too much in his mouth and patted him to see if it would help. I was actually going to tell him off for being greedy.'\n\nThe father-of-two said he patted him on the back repeatedly but realising it was having no effect, he called 999.\n\nHe took instruction from an operator while he waited for paramedics, as a neighbour also stepped in to help with CPR.\n\nOn the way to hospital a paramedic noticed something yellow lodged in Austin's throat and was unable to dislodge it, but cleared the airway to allow oxygen to flow.\n\nWhen he arrived at hospital doctors found there were no signs of life but continued to attempt to resuscitate him, but stopped after 20 minutes.\n\nThe inquest was told the ambulance had arrived after 20 minutes, having been delayed by four minutes after missing a turning.\n\nBut a pathologist said that within two to three minutes of the blockage, Austin's condition would have been deteriorating and that probably began before the call was received by the ambulance service.\n\nLittle Austin with his big brother, four-year-old Noah. The pair were together at their home when Austin choked\n\nMr Thompson said: 'When you consider had the ambulance arrived within the 15 minutes stipulated by national guidelines, Austin would have already seriously unwell.\n\n'I find therefore that the additional four minutes probably didn't alter the outcome.'\n\nPathologist Doctor Srinivas Annavarapu told the inquest the pea was lodged by the vocal cord and had food around it, blocking the airway.\n\nDr Annavarapu said it would not have been possible for someone to remove the food using their fingers and confirmed paramedics would not have been able to carry out the procedure required to dislodge it.\n\nMr Thompson said: 'Austin's death is indeed a tragedy and hearing the evidence today one cannot fail to be moved.'\n\nSpeaking directly to the Hardmans, he said: 'All I can say is to give you my condolences and sorrow for you loss.\n\n'This has been a difficult case for both myself and my staff to deal with I cannot even begin to imagine what it's been like for yourselves. I do hope that in some small way what has happened today at the inquest has given you some understanding what happened to Austin.'", "description": "Austin Hardman's parents Daniel and Emma Hardman, from County Durham, were unable to do anything as their 'perfect little boy' died with the pea lodged in a vocal cord, an inquest heard.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/20079688-0-image-a-19_1571828225687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
