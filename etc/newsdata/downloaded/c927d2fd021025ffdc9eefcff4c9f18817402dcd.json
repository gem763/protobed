Over the dinner table we talk about this idea.\n\nTruthfulness is a way of creating a foundation that when you are, when you do encounter problems and you do have, you know, a kind of a moral dilemma, you \u2014 you can trust the voice that you've articulated or that you've developed, and without that you're lost.\n\nYou have to take the spiritual education of your children seriously. One of the things about Martha that I really love and that I enjoy so much is she's \u2014 she's trying to figure out her place in the world and she's quite inquisitive.\"\n\nMartha: \"I have a family of artists and I also really like to do art.\"\n\nSky: \"She will ask me these really, really difficult philosophical probing questions, and she'll often be sort of provocative about it too, like 'I don't think I believe in God.' But she's setting it up. Like she wants to get into a debate or a discussion about it and question things and \u2014 and in a way that, I think, I probably see some of that in me.\n\nSo we can question things together.\n\nYeah. She's a happy character and she's really, really in her imagination.\n\nAnd a lot of times we think about imagination as being like, daydreamy or something.\n\nBut for me the \u2014 the imagination is the faculty by which we distill experiences into something that we can use to structure our reality.\n\nOne of the valuable things about art is that it's a storytelling tool for making sense of things.\n\nTrying to be honest about who I am as a father, as a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed, as a teacher.\n\nSo truthfulness would be something that with Martha that we, Julie and I, really try to hold a hard line on.\n\nMartha: \"Abstract is all like, it's spiritual. It's in your imagination. It's in the mind, you have to figure out what it is.\n\nBut for me, I don't actually really like abstract. I like to draw pictures that are actually like real things.\"\n\nSky: \"When you start to realize that every action that you have \u2014 whether it's putting on your shoes or doing the dishes or taking your kid to school or buying groceries \u2014 they're all building on our spiritual nature.", "description": "Communication is vital, and raising children to be able to connect in a truthful and meaningful way is so important.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/ArtParenting_Truth_lead.jpg"}
