Mr Trump has always denied the Daniels affair.\n\nThe most eye-catching of Mr Romney\u2019s comments came over impeachment. The House of Representatives, controlled by the Democrats, is expected to vote to impeach Mr Trump before Christmas.\n\nIt will then be up to the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans, to decide whether Mr Trump should be kicked from office.\n\nDiscussing the issue with Axios, Mr Romney said: \"I just want to get as much information as we can, make an assessment consistent with the law and the Constitution.\"\n\nDuring that interview he called the Syria withdrawal a \u201cvery dark spot in America\u2019s history\u201d and said paying a porn star for relations outside of marriage was \u201cnot honourable\u201d.\n\nTo The Atlantic, Mr Romney again did not rule out voting for removal, saying: \u201cAt this stage, I am strenuously avoiding trying to make any judgment.\u201d\n\nMr Romney appeared to acknowledge that history would judge how he and other senators acted, noting to The Atlantic: \u201cI do think people will view this as an inflection point in American history.\u201d\n\nAround 20 Republican senators would need to flip and back removal for Mr Trump to go - something that seems unlikely, given Republican voters overwhelmingly are against removal according to polls.\n\nMr Romney\u2019s political relationship with Mr Trump has been turbulent. He accepted Mr Trump\u2019s endorsement for his 2012 presidential bid but then was fiercely critical when Mr Trump ran in 2016.\n\nAfter Mr Trump won the election the pair met on better terms, with Mr Romney in the running for US secretary of state. However since missing out on the role and then entering the US Senate Mr Romney has again been critical.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s anger at Mr Romney\u2019s criticism over the Ukraine scandal, which triggered the impeachment inquiry, has been evident in a string of tweets he has issued, one with the phrase #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Trump said he expected the House to vote for his impeachment \u2013 something which has happened to only two other US presidents \u2013 but called Republicans to rally to his defence.\n\nHe praised the Democrats for sticking together, saying: \"They don't have Mitt Romney in their midst.\"", "description": "Mitt Romney has declined to rule out voting to remove Donald Trump from office if he is impeached, instead giving an excoriating account of the US president\u2019s personal behaviour and saying he will keep an open mind on the issue.
