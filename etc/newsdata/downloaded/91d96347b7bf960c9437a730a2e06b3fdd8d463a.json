She was sick, he explained, in the grip of an endometriosis flare up, and made bolognese to cheer herself up. The problem is he\u2019s vegetarian and would either have to cook for himself or go hungry for one whole night.\n\n\u201cI argued calmly I felt like I was being cheated out of a nice meal,\u201d the most un-self-aware man on the planet wrote on Reddit\u2019s AITA (Am I the Asshole?) forum, a modern crowd-sourced advice column where people seek arbitration on their behaviour.\n\n\u201cShe burst into tears and asked why I was being so fucking difficult about this. Now I feel like a dick. So, Reddit, AITA?\u201d\n\nIt was screenshot, reposted and discussed in a frenzy of can-you-believe-this.\n\nBefore him it was a father wondering if it was so wrong he and his wife let their \u201cactive\u201d four-year-old \u201cexplore\u201d a \u201cmedium-nice\u201d restaurant while they ate. He was upset when a waitress juggling a tray of food reprimanded their precious child.\n\n\u201cI felt it was completely uncalled for,\u201d the second most un-self-aware man on the planet wrote to Slate\u2019s parenting advice column, Care and Feeding.\n\nEach of these viral problems achieved something seemingly impossible in our divided, hyper-partisan online world\n\nFlash back further and you\u2019ll find a woman with a potentially fatal allergy to mushrooms grappling with parents-in-law who were sneaking mushrooms \u2013 even mushroom powder \u2013 into almost every meal.\n\n\u201cShort of taking them a doctor\u2019s note, telling them my allergy is real, I\u2019m not sure what to do,\u201d she lamented to New York Magazine\u2019s Ask Polly.\n\nEach of these viral problems achieved something seemingly impossible in our divided, hyper-partisan online world. They provided rare moments of unity and moral clarity.\n\n\u201cIn these difficult times, I\u2019m glad we can all come together and agree that this man objectively sucks,\u201d the feminist writer Jessica Valenti tweeted about the first problem.\n\nWe are living in a new golden age of advice columns. They\u2019re everywhere \u2013 thanks to readers like me who can\u2019t get enough \u2013 and they\u2019re better than ever.\n\nThey range from the pithy (Reddit) and the utilitarian (Ask a Manager) to the genuinely philosophical. When I can\u2019t sleep at night, sometimes I turn on the Dear Sugar podcast \u2013 the smooth voices, wisdom and empathy of hosts Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond is a weighted blanket for the soul.\n\nThe first golden age of agony aunts, as they were once known, began in the mid 19th century and was powered by technological and cultural change: mass media and mass literacy converging with shifting social mores. Cheap to produce and compulsive to read, these columns proliferated in newspapers and magazines, instructing anonymous readers \u2013 frequently concerned women \u2013 how to behave properly and, often, be good wives.\n\nWhat can I do about three cat-murdering dogs in a neighbourhood yard? Read more\n\nThe new boom is similarly made possible by technological shifts. Asking for, sharing and bingeing on advice is ever more accessible.\n\nThe irresistible allure of other people\u2019s problems remains a big drawcard. \u201cThey\u2019re even more assuring these days because they\u2019re an antidote to the angst of observing everyone\u2019s polished social media,\u201d one friend and fellow addict observed. \u201cThey\u2019re a reminder that everyone doesn\u2019t have their shit together.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also an affirmation of the indignities and frustrations we all endure. It\u2019s little surprise the genre of AITA problems that often strike a chord with women are those that highlight the cluelessness of some men about the imbalance of labour, both domestic and emotional, in heterosexual relationships (like the aforementioned vegetarian left to fend for himself for one meal). Many women share these questions as if to say \u201csee what we have to put up with out here?\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more to the new gilded age than that.\n\nIn a world where traditional moral structures and authorities have crumbled and real world communities have fractured, these corners of the internet offer rare, ordered space to collectively process who we are today, and what an ethical, satisfying life might look like. From the most irritating minutiae of modern life (Help! My Sister\u2019s Fianc\u00e9e Has a Fake Service Dog) to the biggest questions (I\u2019m Paralysed by Anxiety About Climate Change) someone has asked \u2013 and someone has answered.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s the answers more than the questions that keep me coming back.\n\nThere\u2019s less moral absolutism, and more, let\u2019s figure this out\n\nAdvice columns are no longer just a place to ask questions we can\u2019t broach with family or friends for fear of embarrassment. Many now serve to answer questions that would be wholly foreign to our parents.\n\nThe unimpeachable, all knowing (and usually straight, white and prim) agony aunt has given way to a more diverse generation of writers who openly discuss their own faults and lives, or crowds coming together in comment threads and forums. There\u2019s less moral absolutism, and more let\u2019s figure this out.\n\nSince coming out as trans, Dear Prudence\u2019s Daniel Mallory Ortberg frequently helps his readers navigate coming out to their families or how to be a good ally. Consent in the age of #MeToo was explored across three moving episodes of Dear Sugar, where the hosts reckoned with their sexual histories alongside their listeners. Ask Polly has become something of a beacon to listless, anxious and broke millennials seeking reassurance that they\u2019re doing OK. \u201cLearn to treat yourself the way a loving older parent would,\u201d she told one questioner. \u201cTell yourself: this reckoning serves a purpose.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because we live in such uncertain times \u2013 an era marked by the absence, indeed the refusal, to commit to solutions to the big problems threatening our very existence. Reading about climate change, inequality and rising extremism can make us feel hopeless and adrift.\n\nIs it any wonder that a place where problems, however small, are earnestly shared and thoughtfully resolved is so alluring, and can maybe even help us sleep at night?", "description": "Agony aunts are having a renaissance, but this generation of advisers look nothing like their forebears", "authors": ["Josephine Tovey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f1c1b075b5e51f1f9c10a2907efed01c3103ca/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=641c3954bcafd38fcf01e1966b2a5dce", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
