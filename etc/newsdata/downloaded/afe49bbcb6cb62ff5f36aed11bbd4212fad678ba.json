The first trailer for John Turturro\u2019s Lebowski spin-off, Jesus Rolls, has arrived. Only problem, it\u2019s in Italian. As someone who took 10 years of French, and is fluent in trailer editing conventions, I can tell you that the movie is about what happens after Turturro\u2019s Jesus Quintana gets out of prison. He meets Bobby Cannavale, and the two become enmeshed in a frightfully artistic love/friendship triangle with Audrey Tatou. They do Jon Hamm dirty, which is bad because he has a gun. Also, Susan Sarandon is there. The movie premieres in Italy next month, which explains the dub. American moviegoers will have to wait until early 2020.\n\nRelated", "description": "John Turturro\u2019s sequel to The Big Lebowski, Jesus Rolls, got its first trailer.
