Anothe image showed her being sexually assaulted with a dummy.\n\nMiss Husbands said the the chat logs found by the police investigators amounted to a paedophile manual.\n\nIn a series of depraved conversations with others online How calling himself 'Dark Medic' spoke of when he had begun assaulting the children and what he was doing to them, going into sickening detail..\n\nTo one pervert he said in an online communication: 'Got go go slow. The mother doesn't know. got to be careful with marks.'\n\nHe spoke of his excitement at progressing the abuse of the children and of building up the trust with them.\n\nJudge Bishop hearing the details commented: 'This is the worst case I have ever had to deal with.'\n\nDefending Adam King told the court 'He has asked me to relay his regret and the fact that he feels terrible.'\n\nThe barrister said Howe had served as a medic in the army. He said Howe had been on battlefrields tending soldiers who had had limbs blown off.\n\nHowe pleaded guilty to the rape of a child under 13, five charges of assault of a child by penetration, causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, two charges of sexual exploitation of a child, possessing a paedophile manual, distributing indecent photos of a child and three charges of making indecent photos of a child.\n\nPassing sentence Judge Bishop said the offences demonstrated a depravity and cruelty 'which was impossible to understand.' He added 'These offences are deeply disturbing.'\n\nThe judge told Howe it was obvious he'd had an interest in causing the children pain and his delraved activity involved bondage and sadism. He sentenced Howe to an extended sentence of 29 years.\n\nThe judge said the custodial element of the sentence was 21 years of which he would have to serve two thirds before the parole board could decide whether he was suitable for release\n\nHe said Howe would then be in licence for a further eight years. Howe was also made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order\n\nDetective Constable Kerry Smith from the Internet Child Abuse Investigation team (ICAIT), investigating, said: 'This man is probably the worst child sex offender we have ever come across and we are pleased that he has admitted to these horrific offences.\n\n'He was having conversations with other sick individuals about sadistic sexual abuse against children. The imagery on his devices were of an extremely graphic nature, which showed the sexual abuse he was committing against very young children.", "description": "Craig Howe from Chicksands in Bedfordshire shared sick photos of abuse he'd carried out and has been jailed for a sting of sexual offences at Luton Crown Court.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/20/19506588-0-image-a-24_1570647909107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
