Let me explain.\n\nAt This Point, the Smart Move for AMD Stock Is to Wait More\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf timing is everything, AMD\u2019s surprise announcement one month ago that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are using the company\u2019s second-generation EPYC chips in their data centers couldn\u2019t have come at a less opportune time. Nevertheless, despite a trade war-induced, risk-off market environment at the time, the news, was and is, huge for AMD stock.\n\nBottom line, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the 800-pound gorilla with a near monopoly in the cloud and large-enterprise markets. As much, AMD\u2019s addition of Google and Twitter to its list of enterprise clients is a big win. But there\u2019s more reasons to see plenty of upside for AMD stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 customer base already includes Microsoft (NASDSAQ:MSFT) and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPE), among others. Thus, Alphabet and Twitter\u2019s business is simply the latest evidence of growing support. And with just 2% of the data center business, it would be hard to disagree with Atlantic Equities which sees AMD taking as much as 25% of this key market away from Intel over the next decade.\n\nAMD Stock Weekly Chart\n\nOn the AMD stock price chart Wall Street showed its enthusiasm for the company\u2019s business wins. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices soared more than 16% in the immediate aftermath and hit fresh relative highs the following session. The better news is if timing is everything, then in today\u2019s market AMD is an even better buy.\n\nOne month later, Advanced Micro Devices gave back the bulk of its Alphabet and Twitter-fueled gains. A challenging, but technically constructive August resulted in a bullish market follow-through day signal on Aug. 13. AMD stock investors are being offered an attractive discount to last month\u2019s news-driven reaction. However, I\u2019d wait before making a purchase decision.\n\nThe truth is last month\u2019s EPYC news vaulted shares out of technically fragile situation where key longer-term and uptrend support narrowly failed in unison. The brief betrayal is highlighted in yellow and it\u2019s enough to give pause regarding buying on weakness. Given today\u2019s more supportive market for buying momentum, I\u2019d propose investors postpone today\u2019s discount in AMD stock in favor of supportive price confirmation.\n\nThe Bottom Line on AMD Stock\n\nMy advice is to put Advanced Micro Devices on the radar and wait for a move through $32.25 before buying.\n\nThe entry sacrifices roughly 5% of upside from today\u2019s AMD stock price. More important, this strategy only buys shares on the condition of a breakout above multiple failed attempts near $32. And given a much healthier market for today\u2019s buyers \u2014 that\u2019s a smarter way to invest in the future of AMD stock at a discount.\n\nDisclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler\u2019s management currently own positions in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.
