But then he produced a surge to close - and then catch his rivals - with over a mile remaining.\n\nLaura Muir says 'cloud' hangs over Sifan Hassan's stunning 1500m victory Read more\n\nHawkins wasn\u2019t finished yet. He then made a bid for gold, driving hard and ahead of his four rivals. But it turned out they had just been biding their time. And within sight of the line three of them overtook him - which meant he had to settle for fourth, the same position as at the 2017 world championships in London.\n\n\n\nLelisa Desisa took gold for Ethiopia in 2:10.40, with silver going to Geremew, four seconds back. Amos Kipruto of Kenya took bronze in 2:10.51, with Hawkins clocking 2:10:57.\n\n\n\nWhen it was put to the Scot that it was a phenomenal performance, especially in the high, 29-30C heat, his response was succinct. \u201cNot quite phenomenal enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gutted. Maybe I just gave too much in the middle stages. But I couldn\u2019t do any more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI felt great with two laps to go, but I knew I didn\u2019t have a huge kick,\u201d he added. \u201cI was just trying to burn them off. I really wanted that medal and that\u2019s what I trained for but it wasn\u2019t to be on the night.\u201d\n\n\n\nHawkins proved, however, that he could handle the heat after the images of him collapsing with heatstroke and dehydration at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games in Australia went viral - and he will be hopeful of improving on his ninth-placed marathon finish in Rio at next year\u2019s Olympics.", "description": "Hawkins finished fourth, just as he did in London two years ago, and could not prevent Lelisa Desisa taking gold for Ethiopia in 2:10.40", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3f9760a9a92ed1158a6212e478263fbda655e83/0_129_2714_1628/master/2714.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=530668a4a70fb87c3e3bf9ee13b7d735", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
