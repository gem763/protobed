The ten riders on the advisory panel will lead the way on improving safety for Deliveroo\u2019s network of more than 8,000 riders across the country. Our rider advisory panel enables us to give riders a voice and representation on issues that matter to them, and in turn gives us invaluable insights on how we can continue to evolve and improve our practices. The advisory panel will regularly meet with Deliveroo's senior leadership to discuss challenges and concerns around rider safety, and advise on safety initiatives and activities to address the issues most important to them. Safety is absolutely paramount to Deliveroo and to our riders. There\u2019s no better way to understand the challenges and concerns of our riders than going out on the road and experiencing it - this is what I will do at least once a month. This is a standard set by Deliveroo\u2019s global chief executive and one that I am looking forward to embedding into my role so that we can continue to deliver the best possible service to riders, restaurants and consumers.\n\n'The result of these attacks on riders' take-home pay is to heap extra pressure on riders to make more deliveries as quickly as possible, forcing them to take safety risks,' he said.\n\n'Deliveroo riders aren't paid a guaranteed rate and they can work shifts for the company without any pay at all.\n\n'The company has removed guaranteed hourly rates, increased delivery distances and slashed rates.'\n\nMr McManus said Deliveroo's 'rider advisory panel' would 'give riders a voice and representation on issues that matter to them'.\n\n'In turn (it) gives us invaluable insights on how we can continue to evolve and improve our practices,' he said.\n\nUber Eats, an subsidiary of the American ride-sharing giant Uber, has to date, had the worst fatality record.\n\nFrenchman Julien Trameaux, 24, was killed in November 2017.\n\nTaiwanese nationals Kuan Wei 'Bill' Chen, 28, and Su Po Hsu, 32 were killed in January 2019.\n\nA P-plate driver was last month charged over the death of Chen Kim Pei, a 41-year-old Malaysian national.\n\nAn Uber Eats spokeswoman said it took safety seriously.\n\n'Safety is a top priority for us at Uber Eats,' she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.\n\n'Everyone wants to deliver or receive their order safely, which is why our community guidelines make it clear that safety comes first.'\n\nThe spokeswoman added Uber Eats had also introduced bike safety tests, and was working with Bicycle Queensland to roll out safe bike riding videos.", "description": "The British gig economy start-up has appointed 10 riders to a board tasked with advising it on road safety issues - four years after it opened in Australia.", "authors": ["Stephen Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19715908-0-image-a-3_1571095855644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
