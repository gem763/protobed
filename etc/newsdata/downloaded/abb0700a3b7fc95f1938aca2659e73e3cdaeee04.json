Since [Lopez's] photo was posted on an Instagram story, which only lasts 24 hours, it becomes harder to calculate how much 'damage' the plaintiff is entitled to. Arguably, the author would still have been able to sell the photograph to publishing houses in full resolution and with a degree of permanency.\u201d\n\nA representative for Bieber provided no comment when approached by The Independent.", "description": "Justin Bieber is reportedly being sued for sharing a paparazzi photograph of himself on Instagram.
