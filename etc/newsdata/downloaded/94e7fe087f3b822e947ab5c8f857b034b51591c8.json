He described the images for reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday.\n\nThis image shows the destruction of the compound in Idlib province in Syria where al-Baghdadi hid.\n\nAerial footage shows the aftermath of the destruction of the compound where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hiding. Department of Defense\n\nU.S. Central Command shared video on Twitter that showed fighters near the compound beginning to fire on U.S. aircraft participating in the raid.\n\n\"...at the compound, fighters from two locations in the vicinity of the compound began firing on U.S. aircraft participating in the assault.\"\n\n- Gen Frank McKenzie CDR USCENTCOM pic.twitter.com/SkrtHNDs7w \u2014 U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) October 30, 2019\n\nAnd this is the compound where al-Baghdadi hid in Northwest Syria.\n\nThe compound where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hiding, seen during the raid that left him dead. Department of Defense\n\nThe CENTCOM commander told reporters that four men and two women were killed in the assault, and that two children probably \"under 12\" years of age were killed when al-Baghdadi detonated his bomb-laden vest. McKenzie also suggested that in his last moments, al-Baghdadi may have fired from the tunnel where he fled. He did not confirm a claim that President Trump made, that in al-Baghdadi's final moments, he was \"screaming, crying and whimpering.\"\n\nMcKenzie also said that the DNA analysis confirming al-Baghdadi's identity showed \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\" that the man who died over the weekend was al-Baghdadi. He described it as a \"direct match\" that \"produced a level of certainty that the remains belonged to Baghdadi of 1 in 104 septillion.\" In explaining this level of certainty, McKenzie produced a slide that said \"if the population of earth was 14.8 quadrillion times what it is today, you would still only expect to find one person with this DNA profile.\"\n\nAl-Baghdadi's remains were \"buried at sea in accordance with the Law of Armed conflict within 24 hours of his death,\" according to U.S. Central Command.\n\nThere was also a little more information revealed about the dog involved in the U.S. operation. He's a four-year veteran of the program, has been in 50 combat missions and was injured by exposed electrical cables in the tunnel. He has been returned to duty.", "description": "General Frank McKenzie released images and video from the raid that resulted in the ISIS leader's death over the weekend", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/30/0ddf6e31-9c81-4d3d-b545-ee67945e90e6/thumbnail/1200x630/627144b6d4a07c9323e4ca851a6a62fb/screen-shot-2019-10-30-at-5-29-49-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
