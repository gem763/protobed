No problem!\u201d\n\nTrump, who revealed top-secret information to Russian officials in 2017, questioned whether anybody is \u201cdumb enough\u201d to believe that he would say something \u201cinappropriate\u201d on the phone with a foreign leader.\n\nAnother Fake News story out there - It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\n....Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u201d call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\nThe Post reported Wednesday that a U.S. intelligence official filed the complaint with Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson\u2019s office on Aug. 12. The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint was related to a series of interactions \u2014 not just a single discussion with a foreign leader.\n\nDuring a closed-door hearing with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, Atkinson repeatedly refused to confirm or deny the substance of the complaint, The New York Times reported.\n\nAtkinson found the complaint to be credible and considered it a matter of \u201curgent concern,\u201d he wrote in a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) earlier this month.\n\nBut Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire did not believe the complaint met the definition of an \u201curgent concern\u201d about which Congress needed information, Atkinson wrote.\n\nMaguire has refused to hand over the complaint to Congress, as the law typically requires, according to the Times. His reluctance to do so prompted Schiff to subpoena him. He is scheduled to testify before the committee on Sept. 26.\n\n\u201cAlthough I believe and appreciate the acting DNI is acting in good faith, the acting DNI\u2019s treatment of the Complainant\u2019s alleged \u2018urgent concern\u2019 does not appear to be consistent with past practice,\u201d Atkinson wrote.\n\nSchiff told reporters after the briefing Thursday that he did not get an answer from Atkinson about whether the White House had tried to suppress the complaint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is, to make sure that the national security is protected and to make sure that this whistle-blower is protected,\u201d he said, according to the Times.\n\nThis story has been updated with information about Maguire and Atkinson\u2019s assessment of the complaint and additional comment from Schiff.", "description": "A House panel questioned a U.S. intelligence official about a whistleblower complaint allegedly involving the president and a world leader.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8398983b00002efad768e4.jpeg?cache=tiwgrp8wrr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
