Price\u2019s takedown attempt ended up with the lanky Vick atop him, raining down punches.\n\n\u201cI went for that takedown, horrible takedown \u2013 but I pulled him on top of me and it worked out for the best,\u201d Price said. \u201cI caught him with the upkick with the heel. Boom.\u201d\n\nVick wasn\u2019t defending himself, but then, who expects an upkick?\n\n\u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re going to hit him. Better watch out with me, man,\u201d Price said. \u201cEver hear of a lioness, fighting with all four legs? Come at me.\u201d\n\nPrice was pretty certain the fight was over when Vick immediately slumped onto him upon impact, but he continued competing until referee Herb Dean pulled him off. Price says it was nothing personal.\n\n\u201cWhen I hit him, he was falling onto me, but I\u2019m not going to stop hitting you until the ref stops it. Not to be a punk, but I have to keep hitting him because I have to make sure I win. I\u2019m doing this for my kids, not for him. This is my kids\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nPrice then went into a jubilant celebration until he realized Vick was taking quite a bit of time to come back around.\n\n\u201cI watched it and I was like, \u2018Ohhh,\u2019 and I felt bad,\u201d Price said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hurt anybody like that, like, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019 I want the best for everyone. I want that guy to keep fighting because we all need each other.\u201d\n\nAs for what\u2019s next, Price says physically, he could go again real soon. But there\u2019s just one hangup.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me \u2013 my face, nothing hurts,\u201d Price said. \u201cI have a baby coming in December. I did yell that I would fight again, but it has to be the right opportunity. I\u2019m not going to miss my child\u2019s birth for a paycheck.\u201d\n\nGallery Niko Price def.
