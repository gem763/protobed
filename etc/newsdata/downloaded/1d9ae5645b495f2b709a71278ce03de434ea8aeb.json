But we are brothers. We will always be brothers,\" Harry explained.\n\n\"We are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him, and as I know he will always be there for me. We don't see each other as much as we used to as we are so busy. But I love him dearly and you know the majority of the stuff is probably -- well, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. But as brothers, you have good days and you have bad days,\" he said.\n\nMeghan was warned not to marry Harry\n\nAnother moment came when Meghan spoke of first meeting Harry and her friends weighing in on the new relationship.\n\nMeghan told Bradby that her friends were \"so happy because I was so happy,\" but added that her British friends warned her against marrying the prince.\n\nThe duchess recalled how they told her: \"I'm sure he's great but you shouldn't do it -- the British tabloids will destroy your life.\"\n\nMeghan said that she \"very naively\" underestimated the tabloids as she was unfamiliar with them being American, adding: \"I didn't get it.\"\n\nScrutiny of the couple is taking a toll\n\nOne element to the documentary that had many on social media talking was the couple's unfiltered admissions that they have been struggling.\n\nMeghan fought back tears as she tried to explain the pressure she has encountered as a newlywed and new mom.\n\n\"Any woman, especially when they're pregnant, you're really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging,\" Meghan said. \"And then when you have a newborn, you know. And especially as a woman, it's a lot. So, you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan both admitted to finding life in the spotlight difficult.\n\nClearly trying to find the right words to convey herself, Meghan then thanked Bradby for asking if she was alright in the wake of the intense media scrutiny.\n\n\"Thank you for asking. Not many people have asked if I'm OK, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,\" she said.\n\nPressing on, Bradby asked Meghan whether that meant she wasn't OK, and that it \"really\" had been a struggle, the former actress replied simply with one word: \"Yes.\"\n\nITV's @tombradby spoke to Meghan as he gained exclusive access to the royal couple as they toured Africa for 10 days with their son Archie.\n\n\n\nThe documentary, Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, airs on Sunday at 9pm on @ITV #HarryandMeghan https://t.co/Uy21iE6ozJ pic.twitter.com/XYlHVytiHF \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) October 18, 2019\n\nSeparately, when asked if he feels at peace over the death of his mother, Diana, 22 years ago, Harry described his grief as a \"wound that festers.\"\n\n\"I think being part of this family, in this role and this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he told Bradby. \"So in that respect, it's the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.\"\n\nThe duke also said that the pressures of his life and the toll it took on his mental health required \"constant management.\"\n\nHarry 'won't be bullied'\n\nThe family of three made an appearance together during a private meeting with Archbishop Desmond Tutu during their royal tour of South Africa on September 25.\n\nHarry seemed to be standing firm in his condemnation of the tabloid press , telling Bradby: \"I will not be bullied into playing the game that killed my mum.\"\n\nAt the beginning of October, the Duke of Sussex published a deeply personal statement slamming the UK tabloids for conducting what he called a \"ruthless campaign\" against his wife, Meghan.\n\nBuckingham Palace confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex was suing The Mail on Sunday for unlawfully publishing private correspondence with her father while editing it to change its meaning. The newspaper has denied the accusation, saying it was Meghan's father who asked for the letter to be partially released.\n\nSeparately, Harry has joined a legal action against the publishers of the Sun and Mirror over alleged phone hacking.\n\nMeghan's nickname for Harry\n\nWhile there were many moving moments, there were also some sweet ones too. Whether it was seeing more from behind the scenes of baby Archie's introduction to Archbishop Desmond Tutu or Meghan revealing her nickname for her husband -- H.\n\n\"In all honesty I have said for a long time to H -- that is what I call him -- it's not enough to just survive something, that's not the point of life. You have got to thrive,\" she said, breaking into a smile as she said her husband's moniker.", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed just how difficult life in the spotlight can be in an emotional documentary broadcast in the UK on Sunday.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191020110154-harry-and-meghan-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
