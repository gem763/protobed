Officials said the overhaul of these complex laws would ultimately make the system more efficient, while improving a patient\u2019s overarching treatment -- not make committing fraud easier.\n\nFor instance, a hospital could send a patient who has end-stage kidney disease home with technology to monitor their disease, which would then would automatically transmit any developments back to their doctor. Such an arrangement would currently be construed as illegal under current law.\n\nOfficials said the proposals will:\n\nAllow doctors, hospitals and other providers to create \u201cvalue-based arrangements\u201d arrangements under new exceptions to the current anti-kickback rules\n\nEstablish new \u201cvalue-based\u201d exceptions in order to acknowledge the health care system \u201cpays for value, rather than the volume, of services provided.\u201d\n\nClarify rules for providers by offering specific state harbors for these arrangements\n\nStill, there are some exceptions to the new rules. Namely, pharmaceutical companies, suppliers of medical equipment and medical device labs would be excluded out of concern they\u2019d abuse the system because they rely so heavily on prescriptions and referrals.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that these entities might create arrangements styled as value-based arrangements that serve to tether clinicians or patients to the use of a particular product (e.g., a drug or implantable device, such as a device with a mechanical or physical effect on the body) when a different product could be more clinically effective for the patient,\u201d the proposal said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The announcements comes one week after Trump signed an executive order to expand private-sector Medicare.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Trump-medicare.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
