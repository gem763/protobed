He called the shooting \"very brazen.\"\n\nOfficers have recovered more than 100 shell casings at the crime scene. McCord said the shooters were mostly armed with semi-automatic handguns.\n\nThe shooting occurred on Darcel Avenue near Dunrankin Drive, in the area of Morning Star and Goreway Drive in Mississauga, a city west of Toronto. Police were called to the apartment complex at about 6:15 p.m.\n\n\"Our investigation leads us to believe that the young man who died last night was actually an innocent victim caught up in this indiscriminate attack,\" McCord said at a news conference near the scene.\n\n\"The attackers had complete disregard for public safety within our community and the community made up of the people who live here.\"\n\nPeel Regional Police say they have recovered more than 100 shell casings from the crime scene. (Adrian Cheung/CBC)\n\nMcCord said police also believe the shooting was targeted and motivated by a rap music video that was filmed in the same area and released last week. He said there is information in the video \"challenging\" other people in the community.\n\n\"This was an ambush-type attack. The intended targets appeared to be a group preparing to film a rap video. The rap video that was shot at this location on an earlier date \u2014 and we're still trying to establish when that video was shot here \u2014 has motivated this attack. Another video was to be filmed last night when this attack occurred.\"\n\n4 out of 5 injured still recovering in hospital\n\nWhen officers arrived at the parkette, they found the teen boy suffering from apparent gunshot wounds. Peel paramedics tried to save his life, but the boy was pronounced dead at the scene. His name has not been released.

The victims are not related to each other, he added.\n\nPeel Police Chief Chris McCord spoke to reporters about the incident Sunday, saying there was a group of shooters. (Keith Burgess/CBC)\n\nMcCord said the shooting occurred as people in the parkette were setting up to shoot a music video and an ice cream truck was parked nearby.\n\nA number of families were near the ice cream truck and police have talked to many people who were there. McCord said police would like to speak to the ice cream truck driver.\n\nNo suspects in custody, no descriptions released\n\nNo one is in custody, no suspects have been identified and officers are reviewing security camera video.\n\nNo weapons have been recovered.\n\nMcCord said all of shooters were dressed in dark clothing and some were wearing balaclavas to conceal their identities. They covertly approached the parkette on foot by the side of the building, and once they were in position, opened fire, he said. They fled on foot.\n\n\"I want to reassure the community that public safety is our priority for Peel Regional Police and this investigation will take some time as we go through all of the process.\"\n\nHe said this kind of violence is \"not common\" for Mississauga.\n\nPeel police's homicide and missing persons bureau is continuing to investigate.\n\nPeel police were called to this apartment complex at about 6:15 p.m. on Saturday night.

Police said the victims lived in the area. (Michael Rich/CBC)\n\nCrombie, on the verge of tears when she spoke, said Mississauga needs its share of provincial funding to combat guns and gangs. The city of Toronto has been given money to deal with its gun violence problem and Mississauga needs financial support too, she added.\n\nAs a member of the police services board, she said there could be a need to bring back a community police station in Malton, the area where the shooting occurred, and step up the police presence.\n\nCrombie also thanked the police and paramedics for their swift response.\n\nPolice use drone to get aerial view of crime scene\n\nOn Sunday morning, police canvassed the neighbourhood, knocking on doors in the hopes of finding witnesses and security camera video.\n\nOfficers also sent out a drone to obtain an aerial view of the crime scene and brought in a metal detector to scan for stray bullets in the grass.\n\nAt the scene of the shooting, residents were still reeling on Sunday.\n\nMarjorie Judhan, 73, who lives in the apartment complex, said she initially thought the gunshots were fire crackers, but moved away from the living room after she heard more shots ring out.\n\nShe said she was so shaken by the incident that she couldn't bring herself to follow her Sunday morning routine.\n\n\"Usually I go to church but the way I'm feeling \u2014 I can't,\" she said.", "description": "A 17-year-old boy who was\u00a0killed in a shooting in Mississauga, Ont., on Saturday night was an innocent victim, Peel Regional Police say.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284437.1568562116!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/parkette-shooting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
