Meanwhile, Cooper calls Ronson \u201ca film nerd, but he\u2019s the coolest guy there is.\u201d\n\nMuch of the trailer shows Ronson in the studio as he works on his latest album, \u201cLate Night Feelings.\u201d According to press notes, the film also sees him reflecting on his trans-Atlantic childhood, his ascent in the music industry and the experience of working with Winehouse on her seminal 2006 album, \u201cBack to Black.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-winning success of the song \u201cShallow\u201d from \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d as well as the June release of \u201cLate Night Feelings,\u201d has raised Ronson\u2019s profile substantially over the past year. At present, he\u2019s reportedly working with singer-songwriter Yebba on her forthcoming debut album.\n\nRonson faced a backlash last month, however, when he glibly called himself a \u201csapiosexual\u201d in a \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d interview. Psychology Today defines a sapiosexual person as \u201csomeone who finds intelligence and the human mind to be the most sexually attractive feature for a potential sexual relationship.\u201d It\u2019s a concept that critics have argued is, at best, a pretentious way of saying you\u2019re smart and, at worst, \u201creinforces damaging traditional notions of what it means to be intelligent.\u201d\n\nSome people on social media felt that Ronson was co-opting an LGBTQ-specific narrative when the media dubbed his remarks a \u201ccoming out.\u201d (Ronson himself had not used that term.) He later apologized for his comments.\n\n\u201cHow To Be: Mark Ronson\u201d debuts on YouTube on Oct. 12.", "description": "YouTube's \"How To Be: Mark Ronson\" looks at the musician and megaproducer, who has worked with Bruno Mars and Amy Winehouse.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e4477210000c008acc1f1.jpeg?cache=sdmtzoe4ya&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
