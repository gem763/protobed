We see a wedge-like formation when we look at the hourly chart of Nifty. The break of the wedge currently lies above 11600, which is around the day high from Friday. On the lower side, we see some support near 11500 with that region being tested multiple times. Nifty needs to clear the 11500 region with ease in order to begin its move on the downside.\n\nNifty Hourly Chart\n\nIf we talk about the weekly chart of , we see that Nifty has put in a spinning top doji and has ended the week with gains, though most of the gains were a continuation of the tax-cut announcements from the previous week.\n\nThe moving averages are extended both on the daily and the weekly timeframes, suggesting that any move to the upside may take a few more weeks.\n\nNifty Weekly Chart\n\nWhat can we expect?\n\nSGX Nifty, upon close, was down by about 50 points. We saw the US markets sell-off late on Friday evening. Incase Nifty opens lower, below 11475-11500, we could expect a continuation of the move lower towards 11200. We see 2 critical points of support at 11500 and 11400. For a move higher, any move will be muted since Nifty still needs to digest the 1000 point rally from last week. Nifty will continue to remain flat/bearish with a possible reversal below this week\u2019s lows of 11400.\n\nDisclaimer: This in no way is investment advice.
