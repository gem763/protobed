I think that is absolutely ludicrous and I think that they should be called out.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZucker went on to cite his network's policy surrounding advertisements, saying that CNN has already turned down two ads from President Trump Donald John TrumpSchedule for additional depositions in impeachment inquiry revealed Sondland attorney disputes key portions of Taylor testimony: report Impeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report MORE's reelection campaign because they didn't meet its standards.\n\n\"We have an obligation at CNN, if a political ad comes along and it\u2019s not true, we\u2019re not going to take it,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve turned down I think two ads from the Trump campaign.
