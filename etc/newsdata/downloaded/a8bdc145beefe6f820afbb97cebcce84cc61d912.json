The factory makes between 4 million and 5 million pounds a year of plastic packaging, such as cookie wrappers and sandwich wrapping for the food industry.\n\nAn electrical engineer concerned about climate change, Mr. Ellenbogen started renovating his building nearly 20 years ago with the goal of reducing its environmental impact. As a result, he saves electricity and money at a time when the broader business community in Westchester County is sounding the alarm over what some say is an impending natural-gas shortage.\n\n\u201cBasically, our energy usage over 20 years has gone down, while everybody else\u2019s has gone up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re able to stay here.\u201d\n\nMr. Ellenbogen says his business is making plastics in the most sustainable way possible.

Energy supply to the county is also being squeezed by the impending shutdown of the nearby nuclear power plant, Indian Point Energy Center, which is expected to go offline by April 2021 at the latest.\n\nCon Ed\u2019s moratorium sparked an outcry among local elected officials and business leaders, who warn developers won\u2019t want to build in Westchester if they can\u2019t hook up to natural gas, which is cheaper and considered more environmentally friendly than oil. Business advocates, in particular, are pushing the state to allow for the building of new pipeline, a move opposed by environmentalists who fear it will deepen the state\u2019s dependency on fossil fuels and pollute the state\u2019s waterways.\n\nNew York hasn\u2019t allowed new construction in years; the last pipeline built in Con Ed\u2019s service area was completed in lower Manhattan in 2013. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat whose administration has repeatedly blocked pipeline applications for environmental reasons, in July signed a bill that committed the state to reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 85% by 2050.\n\nA machine unrolls plastic film inside Allied Converters in New Rochelle.

But he said his business is making a universally used product in the most sustainable way possible.\n\n\u201cBeing a closely held company that doesn\u2019t have to answer to shareholders, I made a decision to take the long view,\u201d Mr. Ellenbogen said. \u201cWe have to leave something for future generations so that they can have a viable planet to live on.\u201d\n\nWhen he renovated his building, Mr. Ellenbogen installed a cogeneration system that makes electricity and heat with very little thermal-energy loss. He now pays $39,000 a year for electricity and natural gas for his 55,000-square-foot building, which he said is about the same amount he spent on electricity two decades ago, when his factory was about a quarter of the size.\n\nHe also installed solar panels, which allow him to sell about $21,000 in solar renewable-energy credits a year. That, and the proceeds from Allied Converters\u2019 recycling program, have reduced the company\u2019s total waste-removal and energy costs to a net $6,000 a year, he said.\n\nA robot works to pack finished products inside Allied Converters.

But he said the state needs reliable energy supplies in the meantime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in on renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to get us where we need to be if we don\u2019t expand the pipeline.\u201d\n\nCon Ed says businesses can apply for natural-gas hookups if they reach an \u201cinterruptible service\u201d agreement with the utility to switch to an alternate source, such as oil, when demand gets too high. The utility also reached an agreement with the owners of Tennessee Gas Pipeline, which services Westchester County, that if approved by regulators would allow for the moratorium to be lifted in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe believe the steps we are taking will help us maintain safe, reliable service as we transition to renewables,\u201d a ConEd spokesman said.\n\nKimberly Ong, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said New York can\u2019t slow down as it moves toward renewable energy.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to avoid climate change\u2019s worst impacts, we have to switch to clean energy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be mandated under law very quickly to make this clean-energy transition.\u201d\n\nMr. Ellenbogen says he\u2019s proof that businesses can reduce their fossil-fuel dependency, but he doesn\u2019t think New York can avoid building more pipeline. After running the numbers\u2014he is happy to walk you through his chart-dense power point\u2014he said the state doesn\u2019t have enough renewable energy infrastructure in place to meet its greenhouse-gas reduction goals in the next 30 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with what the environmentalists are trying to do,\u201d Mr. Ellenbogen said. \u201cI disagree with how they\u2019re trying to do it.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Cuomo directed the state Public Service Commission to investigate whether the moratoriums imposed by Con Ed and National Grid, which has restricted hookups in parts of Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, are truly necessary. That review is ongoing, a spokesman for the commission said.\n\nA National Grid spokeswoman said in an email that the utility remains \u201ccommitted to working with all parties to address these critical supply constraint and customer connection issues.\u201d\n\nWith an energy shortage looming, cracks are beginning to show in Democrats\u2019 resolve to block a new pipeline. Earlier this month, six Democratic state senators from Long Island signed a letter to the state Department of Environmental Conservation asking it to approve a new pipeline \u201con an emergency basis\u201d if an independent body deems it necessary.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Cuomo appeared resigned to the fact that a pipeline might be necessary.\n\n\u201cWhat are the alternatives that we actually have to the pipeline?\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview with Long Island News Radio. \u201cNone of the options are good, there will be controversy about all of them, but at the same time we can\u2019t halt development.\u201d\n\nWrite to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com", "description": "Richard Ellenbogen made renovations to his factory 20 years ago that help him save electricity and money while the broader business community in Westchester fears a natural-gas shortage.", "authors": ["Kate King"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120555/social", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
