This cycle, to date, the RNC has more than doubled the Democratic National Committee\u2019s fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt.\n\n\u201cWhile Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month\u2014the highest ever off-cycle\u2014to show for it,\u201d RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News. \u201cVoters are tired of Democrats\u2019 petty politics and baseless witch hunts, and their shameful attacks have only energized our grassroots army and allowed us to lay the groundwork for Republicans to take back the House, expand our majority in the Senate and re-elect President Trump in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes just days after the RNC and the Trump re-election campaign announced a massive third-quarter war chest of $125.7 million.\n\nThe party\u2019s momentum also comes as House Democrats lead an intense impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nEarlier this month, the RNC launched a \u201cStop the Madness\u201d national counter-impeachment campaign, targeting those House Democrats and vowing to cause \u201cchaos\u201d in response to the formal impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\nRNC LAUNCHES 'STOP THE MADNESS' CAMPAIGN TO FIGHT IMPEACHMENT PUSH\n\nThe party spent $2.3 million to keep the pressure on vulnerable House Democrats, as part of the campaign, $2 million for ads across television and digital, and an additional $350,000 multimedia buy that it announced this week on platforms like YouTube, Hulu, and Facebook.\n\nThe multimedia buy this week focuses on peer-to-peer texting and phone calls to more than 30 House Democrat districts, encouraging voters to call their congressman or congresswoman and \u201cstop the madness.\u201d The party also is continuing investment into Facebook petitions, encouraging voters to sign up and \u201cTake a Stand\u201d against impeachment.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to cause chaos,\u201d RNC spokesman Rick Gorka, who is heading up the campaign, told Fox News in an interview earlier this month. \u201cThis is a poison pill. When you couple the impeachment process with the socialist policies being espoused by 2020 Democrats, it\u2019s going to sink their chances at the ballot box, especially with those crucial swing voters and independents across the country.\u201d\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN, RNC RAISED OVER $125 MILLION IN 3RD QUARTER\n\nThe counter-campaign is also leading an on-the-ground effort from grassroots and field teams in critical 2020 states.\n\nMeanwhile, the RNC is expected to continue investing money to grow its ground game to benefit the president\u2019s re-election campaign and Republican candidates nationwide. The party has assigned staff in 19 key target states across the country, with staff, including regional political directors, regional data directors, State directors, and communications directors. In the last month, the party has expanded those efforts to states like Illinois, Colorado, South Dakota, Indiana, Wyoming, and Mississippi.\n\nIn those areas, the RNC is expected to recruit and train thousands of volunteers and conduct voter registration drives.", "description": "The Republican National Committee raised a record-setting $27.3 million in September and had a $59.2 million cash on hand last month\u00a0amid the impeachment push against President Trump --\u00a0which has fueled GOP campaign contributions\u00a0heading into the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
