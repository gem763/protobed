REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n\nQuinn branded the lender\u2019s sluggish performance in Europe and the United States as \u201cnot acceptable\u201d, but said investors may have to wait until early next year to hear his full plans to \u201cremodel\u201d Europe\u2019s biggest bank by assets.\n\nThe latest bid to restructure HSBC comes amid a gloomy business environment, including an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, Britain\u2019s protracted withdrawal from the European Union, an easing monetary policy cycle, and unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nHSBC reported pre-tax profit of $4.8 billion for the third quarter on Monday, compared with the $5.3 billion average of analysts\u2019 forecasts.\n\n\u201cOverall a poor set of results,\u201d said analyst Edward Firth at broker KBW.\n\n\u201cBut the good news is that this performance looks set to finally goad the management into taking some of the actions to address underperforming businesses that we have been awaiting.\u201d\n\nThe earnings update is HSBC\u2019s first under Quinn, and is widely seen by shareholders and insiders as a report card on his audition for the CEO role full-time.\n\n\u201cOur previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth,\u201d Quinn said of the bank\u2019s U.S. and European operations.\n\nAs a result of a \u201cmore challenging\u201d revenue outlook compared with the first half of the year, HSBC said it did not expect to meet its return on tangible equity (RoTE) target of 11% in 2020.\n\nOne of Quinn\u2019s biggest headaches is HSBC\u2019s U.S. retail banking business, which has struggled for years against much bigger domestic rivals and where it booked a loss of $189 million in the first nine months of the year.\n\nSome analysts have said the bank could look to shutter the business entirely, but Quinn dismissed the notion.\n\n\u201cYou should not read into anything I\u2019ve said that we are looking to exit the retail bank in the U.S.,\u201d he said on Monday.\n\nA veteran of the bank since 1987, Quinn, 57, has made no secret that he is keen to secure the permanent appointment of CEO from Chairman Mark Tucker, who said in August the search to replace the ousted John Flint would take six to 12 months.\n\nQuinn said the bank, which generates the bulk of its revenue and profit in Asia, would rebalance capital away from low-return businesses and adjust its cost base.\n\nHSBC will also look to cut costs by simplifying its notoriously complicated management structure and internal reporting lines.\n\n\u201cThere is scope throughout the bank to clarify and simplify roles, and to reduce duplication,\u201d Quinn told Reuters.\n\nSuch action could result in significant costs in the fourth quarter and beyond, including the possible impairment of goodwill and additional restructuring charges, the bank said.\n\nHONG KONG PROTESTS\n\nThe near- to medium-term outlook for HSBC, and rival Standard Chartered PLC, has also been clouded by anti-government protests in Hong Kong, their single biggest profit centre.\n\nHong Kong has fallen into recession, hit by more than five months of protests that show no sign of relenting, and is unlikely to achieve annual economic growth this year, the city\u2019s financial secretary said on Sunday.\n\nHSBC said its expected credit losses - including a \u201ccharge to reflect the economic outlook in Hong Kong\u201d - increased by $400 million in the third quarter. Revenue for the first nine months of the year in Hong Kong, however, rose 7%.\n\n\u201cObviously the economy is getting impacted by two things - the U.S.-China trade dispute and the protests,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson.\n\nThe bank is particularly monitoring its portfolio of small business customers who may be feeling the strain, he added.", "description": "HSBC Holdings Plc dropped its 2020 profit target, reported a sharp fall in earnings and warned of a costly restructuring, as interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn seeks to tackle its problems head-on in his bid for the full-time role.", "authors": ["Sumeet Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445750182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R06O", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
