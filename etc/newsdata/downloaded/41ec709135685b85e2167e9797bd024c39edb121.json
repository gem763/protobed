In 2018, after Russia seized two Ukrainian naval ships transiting the Kerch Strait, the United States conducted an Open Skies flight over Ukraine to \u201creaffirm U.S. commitment to Ukraine.\u201d The U.S. military also conducted an Open Skies flight over Ukraine in 2014 in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea.\n\nSome Republicans, too, continue to support the treaty. Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cwe get valuable access to Russian airspace and military airfields on short notice\u201d and that he has \u201cyet to see a compelling reason to withdraw from Open Skies.\u201d\n\nU.S. Strategic Command, which oversees the U.S. nuclear arsenal, also Tuesday morning retweeted Bacon\u2019s support for the treaty as something that \u201chelps build confidence & increase transparency.\u201d\n\nIn their letter, Menendez, Reed, Engel and Smith argued that withdrawing from Open Skies \u201cwould be yet another gift from the Trump administration to Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty would be perceived as casting further doubt on the status of the United States commitment to Ukraine\u2019s security and would advance the Russian narrative that the United States is an unreliable partner in the region,\u201d the lawmakers wrote, in an apparent reference to the House impeachment inquiry into whether Trump leveraged U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure its leaders to investigate political rival former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE.\n\nThe lawmakers also highlighted that this year\u2019s House-passed version of the annual defense policy bill would prohibit funding to withdraw from Open Skies unless all other signatories agree Russia is in material breach.\n\nThe letter also slammed the administration for not consulting with Congress or U.S. allies about the issue.\n\n\u201cIf the president withdraws from this landmark treaty, it will fundamentally demean and devalue the United States commitment to treaties and other international obligations,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe request that you not move forward with any action to withdraw or impair the United States as a party to the treaty absent, at minimum, meaningful consultation with Congress.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 7:12 p.m.", "description": "Four top defense and foreign policy Democrats in the House and Senate are raising the alarm about the possibility of President Trump withdrawing from a multilateral treaty\u00a0they argue is a \"critical element\" of U.S. and European security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/putintrump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
