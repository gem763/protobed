Under those circumstances, winning would not be a bonus, but a must. And losing with anyone but his most trusted \u2014 and, in most cases, best compensated \u2014 arms would spawn years of \u201cwhat-ifs.\u201d The Nationals had seen that movie before.\n\n\u201cIt was all based on how long Max could go,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAs the game was rolling along and I started watching Max\u2019s pitch count, I knew there was going to become an inning that we needed to pitch Corbin.\u201d\n\nSo any lingering concern about Corbin\u2019s ability to adjust to relief duties after some ups and downs out of the bullpen in the NLCS \u2014 even worry that he might not be able to start Game 3 on Friday as scheduled \u2014 paled in comparison to the level of concern fostered by other relief options. Statistically speaking, no team has ever made a World Series with a worse bullpen. Anecdotally speaking, no franchise has seen as many trajectory-altering games slip away in the hands of its relievers than the Nationals have in the past half-decade. Martinez did not want to add to this list.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo he called on Corbin, who worked a scoreless sixth. He threw 21 pitches, which wouldn\u2019t automatically preclude him from starting Game 3. Another inning of work probably would have forced the Nationals to push Corbin back, but An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez could start Game 3, leaving Corbin for Game 4. All would not be lost in that scenario.\n\nBut Martinez said later he never entertained the notion of using Corbin for more than one inning. So with two of the best right-handed hitters in baseball looming to start the seventh, Martinez decided to use Tanner Rainey.\n\nRainey is the hard-throwing righty who features dangerous stuff against right-handers \u2014 but who also has a dangerous propensity to lose the strike zone. As it happened, he found too much of the strike zone to George Springer, who punished him with a solo homer to dead center. Then he struck out Jos\u00e9 Altuve. The lead, 5-2 when he started the inning, was down to 5-3 when he departed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy then, Martinez had long since started counting outs, and Rainey hadn\u2019t hit his quota. Martinez wanted him to handle the seventh and said he had mapped that scenario out beforehand because Rainey had been pitching so well lately. He was going to trust Rainey, not just Hudson and Doolittle.\n\nRainey pitched around the lefty Michael Brantley and into a more favorable matchup with right-handed-hitting Alex Bregman \u2014 if one can call any matchup with an MVP candidate favorable. Rainey walked him, at which point Martinez was forced to turn to Hudson sooner.\n\n\u201cI just finished talking to [Rainey],\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI told him: \u2018You\u2019ll be back out there tomorrow. We need you. You got a big out for us.\u2019 And it was a big out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut because Rainey got just one out, the Nationals needed eight more and had two trusted pitchers available to get them.\n\nAD\n\nHudson got the call first, but an infield single loaded the bases, and the Nationals\u2019 hard-fought, unlikely lead was no longer safe.\n\nIf, long before the seventh, someone had sketched out a scenario in which the Nationals lost Game 1 to Cole, the Nationals wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye. That would have made sense.\n\nBut as soon as the Nationals had a lead \u2014 a three-run lead to boot \u2014 losing would become more devastating than disappointing. No game punishes missed opportunities like baseball, and few teams afford their opponents fewer opportunities than these Astros.\n\nAD\n\nSo Hudson stood in the middle of three Astros runners, 60 feet from one of the many formidable Astros hitters, one of two proven shields against a potential Houston comeback. He struck out Yordan \u00c1lvarez to escape the jam. He got two more outs in the eighth, but not before two hits pushed another run across and left a man at second.\n\nAD\n\nAt that point, with the left-handed-hitting Brantley due and the tying run in scoring position, Martinez didn\u2019t have to deliberate much. He called on Doolittle, who pitched them out of the eighth and through the heart of a punishing order in the ninth.\n\nHudson threw 21 pitches. Doolittle threw just 13. Both are expected to be available for Game 2. If the Nationals are to win, they will almost certainly have to.\n\nAD\n\nAnd as for Corbin, neither he nor his manager was sure he will be rested enough to pitch Game 3 on Friday. Without him, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen might not have survived Game 1.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Patrick Corbin works an efficient sixth before Tanner Rainey, Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle navigate the last three innings of Game 1 win.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_-tvNVHWkIzU8TYtN9c1349xgoE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S2MWHCHVJEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
