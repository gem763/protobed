Recently I went to the cinema and out for a meal and a few people stared. I understand why and I have to start getting used to it.\u201d\n\nZoe had a job teaching kids aged three to 11 before the August 14 explosion as she drove through the resort of Siem Reap with her American friend and colleague Abbey Alexander, 18.\n\nShe recalled: \u201cWe were riding back to classes from my house when I saw what I thought was smoke \u2013 but which we now know was gas,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cIt went boom and I came off the bike then ran away \u2013 but Abbey was rolling around on the ground screaming, \u2018I\u2019m on fire\u2019. It was horrendous.\n\n\u201cThen I felt like I was on fire too, like I was walking in flames. I knew my top layer of skin was coming off but Abbey\u2019s skin was dripping off her arm.\n\n\u201cI was trying to calm her down as I thought she was going into shock.\u201d Zoe was flown to neighbouring Thailand\u2019s capital Bangkok, where she had 18 operations in 19 days.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nShe was wrapped in bandages, as doctors removed dead skin in lancing procedures to prevent infection, and was unable to open her eyes.\n\nHer mother Mary flew out to be by her side. She brought her traumatised daughter back to the family home in Rochester, Kent, on September 5.\n\nThe following day Zoe had a three-hour skin graft op in the special burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, West Sussex. It involved work on her left leg and both hands.\n\nZoe, whose lashes and brows burned off, still visits weekly as an outpatient.\n\nSeven specialist doctors have given her a range of treatments, including for her eyes and infections.\n\nAnd they have warned her to ensure that she protects herself from the sun for the rest of her life.\n\nOne fortunate aspect for Zoe is that her medical bills of \u00a3215,000 were covered by a \u00a3350 travel insurance policy.\n\nAbbey faces a similar treatment bill \u2013 but had no cover. She was paid only \u00a310,000 by the LPG station boss. Zoe is still battling for compensation.\n\nShe had hoped to settle in Cambodia with her boyfriend there but fears her injuries will destroy their relationship.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Zoe Eleftheriou, 22, suffered burns to 40 per cent of her body following a gas explosion in Cambodia, and says she feels 'upset' by people\u2019s reaction to her when she summons up courage to go out", "authors": ["Amir Razavi", "Image", "Tim Merry", "Viralpress"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Zoe-Eleftheriou.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
