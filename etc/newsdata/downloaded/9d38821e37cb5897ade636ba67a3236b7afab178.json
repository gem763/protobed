Let me make this absolutely clear today, SNP MPs will not vote for that \u2014 not now, not ever.\u201d\n\nSturgeon added that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is given an opportunity to vote on the arrangements for its border with the Republic of Ireland, Scotland would be the only nation in the U.K. leaving the EU without having voted for that outcome.\n\n\u201cIf there is to be a deal, it seems inevitable that it will include a process to allow Northern Ireland to decide if and for how long it will stay aligned to the single market and customs union. And that\u2019s exactly as it should be. But think about what that will mean. Wales will have voted to leave. England will have voted to leave. Northern Ireland will be given a say over its future.\n\n\u201cScotland will be the only country in the U.K. to be taken out of the EU against our will and with no say over our future relationship with Europe. That is not a partnership of equals.\u201d\n\nSturgeon also said there is \u201cno doubt\u201d the SNP is \u201cwinning the case for independence\u201d of Scotland from the U.K., and that the Scottish government is getting ready to hold a second referendum on the issue in 2020.", "description": "Such an agreement would not be much better than a no-deal scenario, first minister says.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/h_55475472-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
