AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nWill a Rush of Streaming Services Wipe Out Cable Providers?\n\nThe advancement in wireless technology and the choice of Internet viewing by millennials is giving the streaming industry a push. A line of new streaming services is due for launch this year, giving both viewers and investors a new choice in this growing market.\n\nHowever, will giving up cable connection be easy? Let\u2019s analyze causes for the doom of cable TV and rise of streaming.\n\nIs the Future of Cable Gloomy?\n\nAccess to cable at home has seen a gradual decline from around 93% Americans (as recorded by NCTA \u2014 the Internet and Television Association back in 2012) to 66% in 2019. On the other hand, streaming services has made huge progress in the last seven years, with 20% Americans already using them. This has inspired several broadcasters and big names in entertainment to start their own streaming services.\n\nMillennials and the Gen X lag the patience to wait and hold on to one thing. As per a recent survey by Deloitte, 88% millennials and 77% Gen X have subscription to at least one streaming service. Streaming has become a trend more than \u201cjust entertainment.\u201d Streaming services like Netflix, Inc. have become a necessity to stay trendy and feel socially included.\n\nLet\u2019s not blame streaming alone for cable television\u2019s doom, it has drawbacks that just aggravated with the advancement of the wireless technology. Streaming allows one to watch a series without waiting, anywhere and anytime. Moreover, major streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s Amazon Prime have their short and original series which attract viewers.\n\nIn fact, these streaming services provide new movies within a week or two, whereas the same movies take months and sometimes years to be telecast on cable. However, people still using cable connections do not want to give them up as they have Internet services bundled with the television. So, cutting cord is not an option for them as providers sometimes take advantage of the monopoly and force users to take a bundled service.\n\nFurther, privacy has become a major issue for the cable users. Those who avail the Internet with cable television have less privacy on the Internet, as cable internet works with a stable IP address, making tracking easier.\n\nThe Era of Streaming\n\nNetflix had over 151 million paid streaming subscribers worldwide in the second quarter of 2019 with over 6.56 million free trial customers. Of this number, 60.1 million subscriptions are from the United States solely.\n\nWhen Netflix was launched in 1998 as the world\u2019s first online DVD rental store, little did it know that it would become the emperor of the streaming industry. With Hulu\u2019s entry in 2008, other companies also started to feel the rush with the industry\u2019s latent potential. But 2019 seems to be the beginning of the streaming era with big brands slated to launch their platforms by the end of this year.\n\nCable provider like Comcast Corporation has taken bold steps to stay in the market. The company on Sep 18 launched Xfinity Flex device that is a cable box without the cable and free for Internet-only subscribers, costing viewers only $5 per month to rent the box. Though this box has several apps major streaming apps are missing.\n\nGiants like The Walt Disney Company and Apple Inc. are all set to launch Disney+ and Apple TV Plus by the end of November. The competition majorly lies on the content they provide and what viewers need to pay.\n\nMajor content providers like BBC, Disney and Warner Brothers keep removing content or stop renewing permission to play on Netflix as they all are launching their own streaming platforms. All the streaming service providers and entertainment firms are removing their content from Netflix and other free streaming platforms to make their content exclusive.\n\nApple TV Plus will cost $4.99 per month, while Disney+ has a pocket pinch of $6.99. Disney\u2019s best offer will provide a bundle pack of Disney+, ESPN and Hulu for $12.99. Netflix however will struggle to add more subscribers for $8.99 a month without content from Disney\u2019s Marvel-Pixar hits and less content from other production houses. Viewers are going to have a tough time in deciding what they want and how much like to spend.", "description": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Netflix, Amazon, Comcast, Disney and Apple", "authors": ["Zacks Equity Research"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h_EIIjpBQDugNguTobjihA--~B/aD02MDA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/e2860613de2f46ffa7c184a235760cfd", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
