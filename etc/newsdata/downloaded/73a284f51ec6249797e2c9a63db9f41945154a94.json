He should know; he created the first supermarket loyalty card on behalf of Tesco (OTCMKTS:TSCDY). And with the data gleaned from that \u201cClubcard\u201d program, the U.K. grocery chain doubled its market share from 1994 to 1995 alone. Talk about a valuable commodity!\n\nThese days, companies like VMWare are crucial in keeping this gravy train going. And VMW stock is up roughly 70% for us at Growth Investor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe \u201cVM\u201d in \u201cVMWare\u201d stands for virtual machines, which is software that solves a big problem for many businesses: too many servers.\n\nThe more your company grows, the more data storage you need, but multiple servers quickly become a major headache \u2013 and costly. Instead, you can just log into VMWare, and do all your computing on one server. Things run faster and more efficiently, with less confusion. No wonder VMWare grew both earnings and revenue (+12% year-over-year) in the second quarter, both of which beat Wall Street expectations.\n\nNow, these days, many companies don\u2019t keep their own servers, or even rent space in a data center\u2026they just use cloud (online) storage. Or they use some combination of the three. And when it comes to this \u201chybrid cloud,\u201d VMWare has pretty much cornered the market.\n\nThat\u2019s thanks to a historic partnership with one of my other Growth Investor picks: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). You might think of Amazon more for online shopping, or to buy e-books for your Kindle. Well, these days, its biggest profit driver is actually Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nVMWare was already a leader in the cloud computing field; it is the infrastructure platform choice of 100% of the Fortune 500. It also has strong marketing relationships with computer hardware vendors, like Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Now that this \u201cprivate cloud\u201d company has partnered with Amazon\u2019s \u201cpublic cloud\u201d service, customers don\u2019t need to choose.\n\nBelow you can see VMWare\u2019s products for your data center and for VMWare Cloud, plus Amazon\u2019s own cloud services \u2013 and how they can all interact. For Big Data, VMWare and AWS is a \u201cone-stop shop.\u201d\n\nSource: VMWare.com\n\nHospitals, banks, car companies, the Make-a-Wish foundation, even candy companies and colleges all use VMWare to make their data operations more modern (and thus more secure).\n\nThere\u2019s just one final frontier for VMWare and AWS (and their customers): the \u201cmother of all technologies.\u201d\n\nCrunching the Numbers\n\nUp until now, technologies have certainly made our lives easier and more efficient\u2026but with a lot of room for human error. People trip over cords, spill their coffee, and get tired.\n\nArtificial intelligence (A.I.) does not.\n\nAs scientists find even more applications for artificial intelligence \u2013 from healthcare to retail to self-driving cars \u2013 it\u2019s incredible to imagine how much data will be involved.\n\nTo create A.I. programs in the first place, tech companies must collect vast amounts of data on human decisions. Data is what powers every A.I. system.\n\nSo any one company that can help with customers\u2019 data issues \u2013 is the one company that\u2019s most worth investing in.\n\nAfter all, in the 2003 oil boom, investors could either speculate on oil futures contracts\u2026 or they could have bought shares in Core Laboratories (NYSE:CLB).\n\nCore did no drilling or exploration of its own. It provided technology to lots of companies who did. And as oil prices climbed from $30 per barrel in 2003 to $100 per barrel in 2008, Core\u2019s customers had more money to spend on exploration. Along with that, CLB stock rose 1,100%\u2026with less risk.\n\nNow, picture an industry like Big Oil as a huge skyscraper with lots of offices. By buying stock in an individual oil company, it\u2019s like having a key to one of those offices. By buying Core Laboratories, it\u2019s like having a \u201cMaster Key\u201d to all of them.", "description": "VMWare's (NYSE:VMW) meteoric rise after inking a key partnership a couple years ago just goes to show: \"Data is the new oil.\"That phrase was first coined in 2006 by a British statistician named Clive Humby.
