However, a couple of bands of heavy rain and gusty winds could move into parts of Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey -- especially from Ocean City to Atlantic City. The low pressure will be pushed out to shore this evening and tomorrow, with impacts to the rest of the northeast being kept to a minimum.\n\nHowever, as the low pulls away, some gusty winds can be expected in parts of New England on Monday.\n\nA new storm racing into the Central U.S. today will bring severe weather to the Southern U.S. tonight and Monday bringing with it possible tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail possible from Texas to Alabama to Kentucky through Tuesday meaning that nearly 20 million Americans are at risk for severe weather.\n\nPHOTO: A new storm racing into the Central U.S. will bring severe weather to the Southern U.S. tonight and Monday.

The first round of severe storms will develop late Sunday night into early Monday from Texas to Missouri \u2013 including Dallas, Little Rock and Tulsa. There is an enhanced risk for severe weather in parts of southeast Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Strong wind shear is likely in any storms that develop and therefore, there is a chance for tornadoes today across the region. Damaging winds and large hail will also be possible.\n\nIt is important to note that it has been some time since we have a notable tornado threat, and that the sun is setting earlier as we get deeper into fall. Therefore, night time tornadoes are a concern.\n\nElsewhere, a new storm that brought some rain, snow, and strong storms to Pacific Northwest on Friday and Saturday has already moved across the Rockies this morning.
