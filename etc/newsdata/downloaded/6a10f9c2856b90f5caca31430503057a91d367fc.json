Here is part of their conversation.\n\nDr. Sands, I know you have been able to get into some of the hardest hit areas of the islands. Can you describe a bit of what you've seen?\n\nI don't think words could capture the apocalyptic devastation.\n\nIt's almost surreal to see structures that you knew once existed that are just gone, in some instances, or reduced to just splinters, concrete, steel, wood, in places that previously had buildings.\n\nIt is just unbelievable.\n\nDr. Duane Sands says words fail to capture the 'apocalyptic devastation' left by the hurricane. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAnd what are the people facing with whom you met?\n\nThey range from some being totally unscathed, to some who have lost everything. And in some of those instances, they are basically more focused on basic needs like food, water and shelter.\n\nThe Bahamas has historically dealt with weather systems like hurricanes every year. Storms on a regular basis. We thought we were experts on this thing. But nobody, certainly nobody alive, has ever experienced anything like this.\n\nYou have people who are in Nassau, homeless people, who looking for accommodations. What are people up against?\n\nAfter the storm passed, the devastation and the damage not only took out homes and businesses, but it also destroyed roads and harbours and airports. Many of the vehicles on the ground were destroyed.\n\nSo in Grand Bahama, which is 100 miles long, and the population is 50,000, we have one functioning ambulance in the entire island. One functioning ambulance.\n\nSo meeting the need requires that you now have to drop in earth movers, automobiles, trucks to get to people.\n\nAnd then, you have gaping holes that are impossible in the road, where the road has been washed into the ocean. There are many areas you can only access by helicopter.\n\nThen you have bodies and you have to go door-to-door in each island, methodically, deliberately making sure that you don't miss a home, until you can retrieve from the rubble, underneath concrete, steel, wood, in flooded areas, these bodies.\n\nI hope that gives you an understanding, because when people say, \"Oh, it's taken a long time to get to people,\" very few people on the face of the Earth have ever experienced a hurricane at 200 miles an hour, sustained over an area for two days.\n\nAt least 70,000 people are now homeless and many are struggling to access basic supplies. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMany people are wondering what's happened to those that are missing. The official death toll is at this point 50 people. Are you expecting it to be much higher than that?\n\nWe do we believe that the death toll will be considerably higher. And yet, you cannot count bodies that you do not have.\n\nSome of these bodies have probably been washed out to sea because we had a sea surge of 20-plus feet.\n\nAnd so you literally have the ocean come in [and] people are swept away. The ocean recedes and it takes with it property, persons, animals, etcetera.\n\nSome of them have been retrieved. Some of them we're still searching for.\n\nBut we know from reliable reports from family members that there is likely to be a significantly large number of persons who are now listed as missing who are probably dead.\n\nThere's another post-[disaster] problem that often happens when there is such devastation, and that's that there are those who would actually take advantage of the state and engage in looting and robbing people. What do you say to those people?\n\nI say that looting is a pretty strong word.\n\nIf you have somebody who has suffered through a storm raging at 180 to 200 miles an hour for two days, cut off from civilization, with nothing to eat nothing to drink, and they have to survive and they stumble on a building where there could be food or water \u2014 what should they do?\n\nYes, I admit that there have been opportunists who have violently seized goods, stolen goods. But I believe that to be in the minority.\n\nPeople board a cargo ship for evacuation to Nassau at Marsh Harbor, Great Abaco. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nYou know that countries are wanting to help, Canada among them. What do you need from us?\n\nWe need goods. We need clothes. We need food. We need water.\n\nBut most of all, we hope that we can get assistance to rebuild and to once again regain our independence \u2014 meaning that we need help to get up off the ground, to get on our feet again, to recover.\n\nWe recognize that this event lays bare the lie that climate change is not real. And so, certainly for small island developing state, this type of weather event, which was unprecedented, certainly gives more power to the view that we have to, around the world, be environmentally conscious and look at what we're doing to our environment.\n\nWritten by Chris Harbord and John McGill.
