It will spread farther northeast through the Carolinas on Saturday and Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Delaware from Saturday night into Sunday.\n\nEast of Tampa on Friday night, the storm spawned several tornadoes that damaged homes and a school and overturned tractor trailers. A tornado watch remained in effect over much of the central part of the Florida peninsula Saturday morning.\n\nThe storm has also generated significant coastal inundation. Its storm surge, or rise in water above normally dry land, reached 3.2 feet at Apalachicola, Fla., early Saturday.\n\nTropical storm and storm surge warnings cover much of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend areas.\n\nCentered 80 miles west-southwest of Panama City at 8 a.m. Saturday, the lopsided storm is barreling northeast at 17 mph. Nestor\u2019s maximum sustained winds had weakened to 50 mph as of Saturday morning, down from 60 mph Friday night. The storm should make landfall late Saturday morning or early afternoon along the Florida panhandle.\n\nAlready losing its tropical characteristics, Nestor is forecast to weaken after it makes landfall Saturday.\n\nAlmost all of the hazardous weather in Florida associated with Nestor is occurring east of the center with the storm\u2019s heavy rain bands lashing the peninsula. Within those bands, a few tornadoes could spin up.\n\nA 'life-threatening\u2019 storm surge threat\n\nUntil at least several hours after Nestor makes landfall, through much of Saturday, the storm\u2019s most significant hazard is likely to be its surge.\n\n\u201cThere is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation of up to 5 feet above ground level along the Florida Gulf Coast from Indian Pass to Clearwater Beach,\u201d the National Hurricane Center wrote.\n\nThe center forecasts a potential inundation of three to five feet above normally dry ground from Indian Pass to Chassahowitzka, Fla., if the peak surge hits at high tide.\n\nFarther south, from Chassahowitzka to Clearwater Beach, Fla., a potential inundation of two to four feet above normally dry ground could occur, if the peak surge occurs at high tide.\n\nAnd for Tampa Bay, a storm surge inundation of one to three feet is anticipated.\n\nSeveral inches of rain possible from Florida to southern Mid-Atlantic\n\nAs the storm swings northeastward, it will unload moderate to heavy rainfall throughout the Southeast and into the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nMany areas from the Florida peninsula to the southern Delmarva Peninsula could see one to four inches of rain with isolated higher amounts through Sunday morning. Lighter rains of around 0.25 to 0.5 inches are expected in the Washington area, mainly Sunday morning.\n\n\n\n48-hour rainfall forecast from the National Weather Service. (WeatherBell.com)\n\nBecause of the storm\u2019s fast movement and drought conditions in many of the areas where rain is forecast, only isolated cases of flooding area are expected. The rainfall is likely to be mostly beneficial.", "description": "The storm\u2019s rain will push through the Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic through Sunday morning.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "October At Am", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
