It's just incredible, the amount of damage that's happened over there, of course, trees and cars and all the other stuff blown away,\" Ingram said.\n\nBahamian officials have said they received a \"tremendous\" number of calls from people in flooded homes. Desperate callers trying to find loved ones left messages with local radio stations.\n\nThe government has since announced a telephone hotline that Bahamians could call to report missing family members.\n\nThe United Nations and the International Red Cross quickly started mobilizing to deal with the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the wake of the most powerful hurricane on record ever to hit the Bahamas.\n\nMore than 900 members of the Bahamian police and military also responded to help with the hurricane relief, according to the government, which added that \"large numbers of security forces\" from Great Britain and the United States already were involved in search-and-rescue operations.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S DEVASTATION IN THE BAHAMAS REVEALED\n\nOfficials said some 120 Jamaican security personnel arrived in the Bahamas on Saturday evening and 100 troops from Trinidad and Tobago were expected to arrive Sunday to offer assistance.\n\nA government-chartered ferry transported about 250 people displaced by Dorian to Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, arriving on Saturday after a 13-hour trip. They joined hundreds of other people from the Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands who escaped harsh conditions.\n\nMeantime, the National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement on Sunday that no flights were allowed to charge for evacuations of displaced people and that consumer protection officials were investigating \"incidences of price gouging.\"\n\nCivil aviation officials also said they were making sure only approved aircraft providing aid could fly to the hardest-hit islands and were restricting air space over those devastated areas to prevent accidents.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOfficials already have approved 200 private planes and said that \"saturated airspace was creating a volatile situation.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Travis Fedschun and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas has risen to 44 after battering the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama for more than a day and a half last week, according to the health minister.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
