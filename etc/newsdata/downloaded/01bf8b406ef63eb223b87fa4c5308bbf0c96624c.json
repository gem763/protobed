Some of the players were a bit jittery. We\u2019ve kept most of the things the same, but we did change one or two things and emphasised one or two things that they didn\u2019t emphasise previously. Everyone is a bit jittery in how we want to play but this morning was a lot better,\u201d Fourie said.\n\n\u201cIt is focus on something else. When we play in the Northern Hemisphere it is very important to have a very good kicking game, something we didn\u2019t focus on in our home games. There we tried to run the opposition ragged and used the altitude to our advantage, but when we go over we will have to have a good kicking game, and that was the main difference in our focus from the first three games to the tour.\n\n\u201cThe important thing for me is not to take too many chances in our own 22m area and to be organised when we want to kick. Who chases the ball and who stays behind, for instance? It was something we spent a lot of time on, but we aren\u2019t going to be like Faf de Klerk and kick every ball we get.\n\n\u201cWe are also not going to take too many chances in our own half.\u201d\n\nBut that isn\u2019t saying that the Cheetahs are going to abandon their free-flowing style that has won them so many plaudits thus far this season. They simply want to be tactically smarter about it.\n\n\u201cWe will have to adapt to the conditions,\u201d Fourie added, \u201cIf it\u2019s a nice clear day then we will run the ball but if it is raining and windy, then we will adapt to that, and we will have a bit more of a structured kicking game, and try and play in the opposition half and put the pressure on them. The rest of our game will stay precisely the same.\u201d\n\nThe game will also be the last match for stalwart Ox Nche, who with flanker Henco Venter joins the Super Rugby side, the Sharks in November ahead of the 2019 Super Rugby season. Fourie said while there was no emotion, they wanted to make Nche\u2019s farewell a special one.\n\n\u201cOx is not really a very emotional guy, but the guys did do something for him and Henco (Venter) to say thank you from the team. Henco was more emotional than Ox, he tends to take it in his stride, but it isn\u2019t very easy for him to move on and he has made his decision. But I didn\u2019t get the idea it was a big emotional thing.\u201d\n\nThe Cheetahs face Connacht at 18:15, South African time on Saturday.
