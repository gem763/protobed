Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $2.83, according to estimates from FactSet. Revenue came in at $64 billion vs. the $63 billion in revenue expected.\n\nThe report contains insight into demand for the company's new iPhones. The iPhone 11 models went on sale ten days before the company's quarter ended on September 30, so the quarterly report will include 10 days worth of sales data. Investors will also be watching guidance the company gives for its key holiday season.\n\nFacebook also beat expectations with earnings that came in at $2.12 vs. the $1.91 forecast by Refinitiv. Revenue came in at $17.65 billion vs. Refinitiv's $17.37 billion forecast.\n\nThe revenue estimate was about 27% higher than the $13.73 billion the company reported in the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nFacebook might be facing regulatory headwinds, but the Street remains bullish on the name. Estimates compiled by FactSet show that 42 analysts have a buy rating on the stock. Five have a hold rating, and only one analyst \u2014 from Societe Generale \u2014 says to sell.\n\nJames Lee from Mizuho said the stock is one of his top picks in the US internet space, but that potentially light guidance could pressure shares after earnings are released. \"We would be buyers on any weakness post-guidance,\" he said.", "description": "On Thursday we'll get market reaction from Apple and Facebook earnings, as well as a slew of economic data.", "authors": ["Pippa Stevens"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106209840-1572352403824preview-1.png?v=1572352407", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
