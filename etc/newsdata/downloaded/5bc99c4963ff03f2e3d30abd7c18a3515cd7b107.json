From improvements in pacing and narrative techniques, to the strengthening of characters who\u2019s potential had been previously untapped, the BBC One soap is stronger than it\u2019s been in quite some time. In addition to the aforementioned positives, you might have noticed that the show has been experimenting with a multitude of dynamics \u2014 and, more specifically, new dynamics \u2014 as of late, and if so, you\u2019ll likely agree that this factor has played a huge role in putting the serial drama back at the top of its genre.\n\nMartin Fowler\u2019s (James Bye) recent return, for example, has brought with it the opportunity for yet another great dynamic to be explored, as the character finds himself at the beck-and-call of Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden).\n\nWhile these two legacy characters have interacted in the past, they\u2019ve had no reason to share scenes in recent years, which is where Kate Oates and Jon Sen come in, as the pair have worked their magic once more to create a great source of conflict which has ensured that these guys have no choice but to share the screen together.\n\nBen\u2019s got Martin right where he wants him (Picture: BBC)\n\nFans of Coronation Street and Emmerdale will know that this is something of a Kate Oates speciality, as the acclaimed producer has proven during her time on both of these soaps just how fearless she is when it comes to exploring uncharted territory, and \u2014 with Jon at her side \u2014 she\u2019s managed it once again on EastEnders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thing that sets soaps apart from regular drama series\u2019 is that \u2014 in addition to the fact that they\u2019re on all year round \u2014they\u2019re about the residents of a community setting as opposed to being about any one character in particular. Ergo, soaps are ensemble pieces \u2014 and history has proven that this is when the genre operates at its best.\n\nEastEnders was undoubtedly once the most community-driven series on the telly, but somewhere along the line it lost a little bit of that sense of community and, as a result, episodes could occasionally feel like a collection of separate narrative threads that \u2014 aside from the fact that the action was all taking place on the same square \u2014 had no connection to the other concurrently running arcs. As a result, characters had little to no reason to interact with any one not involved in their own storyline.\n\nJohn Yorke set in motion a change when he began exploring several new dynamics last year \u2014 the greatest of which was undoubtedly the relationship between Sharon (Letitia Dean) and Keanu (Danny Walters), which provided both characters \u2014 Sharon, in particular \u2014 with the best material they\u2019ve had in years.\n\nSharon and Keanu worked incredibly well (Picture: BBC)\n\nKate and Jon have since built upon John\u2019s efforts, and \u2014 in doing so \u2014 they\u2019ve managed to revitalise the show as a whole, and thus fully restore that essence of community.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: EastEnders has always thrived on its wonderful dynamics. Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie (Anita Dobson), Peggy (Barbara Windsor) and Pat (Pam St Clement), and Mick (Danny Dyer) and Linda (Kellie Bright) are just a few that come to mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some of the show\u2019s finest over the years have been those between characters that you wouldn\u2019t have necessarily paired up. Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), for example, or Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). For the soap to continually move forward, it\u2019s important that new dynamics such as these ones are born.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult task, for sure. You see, it\u2019s not just a matter of throwing two characters together and seeing if it works \u2014 that formula would certainly wear thin rather quickly \u2014 but rather, it\u2019s about finding a believable way to bring two characters together \u2014 characters who, under any normal circumstances, would have no obvious reason to interact with one another \u2014 and building around said reason. In other words, it\u2019s about finding common ground or \u2014 in Martin and Ben\u2019s case \u2014 a common goal.\n\nWith block-storytelling a thing of the past, Kate and Jon were able to do just that, as \u2014 because EastEnders is very much an ensemble piece once more thanks to Kate\u2019s efforts \u2014 the narrative threads tend to overlap quite frequently, which \u2014 not only makes for a much more entertaining show \u2014 but also provides more opportunity for new dynamics to be experimented with.\n\nCallum (Tony Clay) and Ben\u2019s relationship is the prime example of how successful this formula\u2019s been. Due to the current interlinking nature of the soap\u2019s storylines, Callum \u2014 who was struggling with his sexuality \u2014 was able to cross paths with Ben.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis interaction not only allowed for Callum\u2019s internal struggle to come to light in a realistic and believable way, but it also provided him with someone to talk to about said struggle, and Ben \u2014 who had previously struggled with his own sexuality \u2014 was the perfect person for Callum to confide in. It was then, via this expertly executed storyline, that romance was able to ensue.\n\nThe dynamic between Callum and Ben is one of EastEnders\u2019 finest (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe same ideology can be applied to Stuart (Ricky Champ) and Rainie\u2019s (Tanya Franks) wonderful relationship. Both characters lived in Walford for near enough a year without ever having reason or opportunity to interact with one another. However, a nifty plot device \u2014 i.e. Dot\u2019s inheritance \u2014 did the trick, and ultimately resulted in them being forced into each other\u2019s company.\n\nThe reason they remained as a duo, however, is down to the fact that \u2014 in spite of their efforts to be better people \u2014 both have been continually ostracised and pushed out by just about everyone else in their lives, so they ultimately found acceptance in one another.\n\nIt\u2019s not just new romantic relationships that have aided in restoring EastEnders\u2019 former glory either, as some of the best dynamics as of late have been those between characters who\u2019ve only interacted a handful of times \u2014 which is akin to the interactions you\u2019d see in real-life close-knit communities.\n\nBobby (Clay Milner Russell), for example, would normally have had no reason to interact with Callum \u2014 nor would Lisa (Lucy Benjamin) with Bex (Jasmine Armfield), or Bex with Stuart \u2014 but they were brought together because the other person in these equations were able to understand what they were going through at one moment in time and subsequently empathise them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same thing can be said about Iqra (Priya Davra) and Keegan (Zack Morris), Habiba (Rukku Nahar) and Honey (Emma Barton), and Kush (Davood Ghadami) and Kat (Jessie Wallace). It\u2019s about common ground.\n\nOf course, the great thing about all of these new dynamics is that, in turn, they\u2019ve provided for plenty of fresh story content. The current Martin and Ben narrative is the perfect example, as the pair were forced into a situation because of the love they have for their families, but they\u2019re ultimately stuck with one another because \u2014 much like he always does \u2014 Ben spied an opportunity to use said situation to his benefit.\n\nAs a result, we\u2019ve got a juicy storyline that could well carry on for several months \u2014 which, in a sense, is what soap is all about.\n\nThe efforts made by Kate, Jon, John and the entire story team have well and truly paid off, as EastEnders isn\u2019t just in a great place, but rather it\u2019s in one of the best places it\u2019s ever been in \u2014 period. The content is new and fresh, and these new dynamics \u2014 and, by association, the new storylines \u2014 have been instrumental in getting it to this stage.\n\nYes, much like it was at the beginning \u2014 and throughout many of its strongest periods \u2014 EastEnders is community-driven once more and, if history has taught us anything, herein lies its strength.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "From unpredictable romances to newly-formed partnerships, EastEnders feels like a community again \u2014 and in therein lies its strength.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson", "Soaps Journalist"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EastEnders-dynamics-3597_1571389445.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
