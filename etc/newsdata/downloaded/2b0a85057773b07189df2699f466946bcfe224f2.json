I will keep working with my colleagues and the Governor to push back wherever possible.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Kathryn Phillips, Director for non-profit environmental organisation Sierra Club\u2019s California branch, called the veto \u201cdisappointing and illuminating\u201d.\n\nAccusing the governor of bowing to the influence of special interest groups representing big business, she added: \u201cWith this veto, we are seeing more of the same overzealous alignment with interests that want to exploit natural resources without regard to the environment or the public interest.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing this alignment at a time when it presents serious risk to California.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

You know, there\u2019s tremendous pollution being put into the ocean because they\u2019re going through what\u2019s called the storm sewer that\u2019s for rainwater,\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) went on to warn the state over water and air pollution - and threatened to withdraw California\u2019s federal road funding unless changes were made.\n\nReferencing the Ukraine scandal that has led to impeachment proceedings being launched against Mr Trump, a spokesman for Mr Newsom told The Washington Post at the time: \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s a common theme in the news coming out of this White House this week. The president is abusing the powers of the presidency and weaponising government to attack his political opponents,\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not about clean air, clean water or helping our state with homelessness. This is political retribution against California, plain and simple.\u201d", "description": "The Democratic governor for California has vetoed a bill designed to roll back Trump-era cuts to environmental regulations, prompting anger from lawmakers and environmental groups.
