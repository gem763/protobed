You may not realise that over a period of time you have managed to create a rift between your partner and you, and it might seem odd that he seems a bit \u2018off\u2019 but check if you are guilty of these. Upfront, the habits seem normal, but are problem creators.\n\nConstantly giving instructions\n\nNo one likes to be told how to do things all the time. Whether it is backseat driving or offering comments on how to handle a situation even before the person has a chance to think on his own. It\u2019s not like your partner is a child who needs to be monitored all the time, so don\u2019t treat him like one. Even if you think your way be better (everyone thinks that!) just let him do it his way.\n\nConstantly cutting him off\n\nCommunication is a two-way street where both partners should have an equal chance to talk to each other about the topic at hand. If you constantly cut him off when he is talking because you either got distracted with something you saw or remembered, or you have a similar story to tell, it can be a major put off.\n\nOvercriticising\n\nWho likes to be told off time and again? You think you are right so you say what you feel honestly, but have you ever tried focusing on the positives? Ideally, 80 per cent of what you say to each other should be positive or neutral and only 20 per cent (only if need be) should be critical. If you start voicing the smallest of things in a complaining tone, you are setting yourself up for trouble, since it will make him drift away, emotionally.\n\nNo empathy in times of distress\n\nIf your partner is going through an emotionally tough time due to personal or professional distress, and you are unavailable for him to talk to or turn for comfort, then can you blame him for feeling dejected? You can justify it with many reasons that you have problems of your own or work has been hectic, but it won\u2019t be enough.\n\nTaking him for granted\n\nThis happens more often than one can care to admit. When you reach a certain level of comfort in your relationship with each other, it can happen that you take each other for granted. This is acceptable when done a few times and for smaller issues, but making it is a habit is what causes the problem.", "description": "Human behaviour entails certain habits which are difficult to shake off, but might be detrimental.
