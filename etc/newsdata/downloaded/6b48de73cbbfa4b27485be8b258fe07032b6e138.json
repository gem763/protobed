This was most notable Monday after banks submitted bids for more than twice the $30 billion of two-week loans offered by the Fed.\n\nDemand to borrow cash in the repo market is expected to increase as the end of the quarter approaches. Banks often opt to hold more cash at the end of fiscal quarters to ensure that they have enough liquid assets to protect against potential losses.\n\nThe Fed could continue to offer cash to financial firms through the repo market for the rest of the year, said Jerry Pucci, who oversees repo trading at BlackRock Inc., Tuesday at a conference held by the New York Fed.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to add reserves is intended to prevent a cash shortfall at that crucial period. The cost to borrow cash rose as high as 10% last week as cash left the financial system following quarterly corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury auctions. A surge in demand at the end of last year pushed repo rates to as high as 6%.\n\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com", "description": "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it would increase the size of overnight cash loans to $100 billion from $75 billion.", "authors": ["Daniel Kruger", "Daniel.Kruger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-110643/social"}
