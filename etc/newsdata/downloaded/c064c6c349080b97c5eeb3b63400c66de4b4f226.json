Vice was first to report the story. Since then there have been numerous cases of abuse \u2014 including the mass collection of vehicle locations in a single database, and popular iPhone apps that were caught collecting user locations without explicit permission.\n\nThe cell giants have since promised to stop selling location data but have been slow to act on their pledges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to regulate the industry,\u201d said Foursquare\u2019s chief executive Jeff Glueck (shown on the left in the photo above) in an op-ed in The New York Times on Wednesday.\n\nIn his opinion piece, Glueck called on Congress to push for a federal regulation that enforces three points.\n\nFirstly, phone apps should not be allowed to access location data without explicitly stating how it will be used. Apple has already introduced a new location tracking privacy feature that tells users where their apps track them, and is giving them options to restrict that access \u2014 but all too often apps are not clear about how they use data beyond their intended use case.\n\n\u201cWhy, for example, should a flashlight app have your location data?,\u201d he said, referring to scammy apps that push for device permissions they should not need.\n\nSecond, the Foursquare chief said any new law should provide greater transparency around what app makers do with location data, and give consumers the ability to opt-out. \u201cConsumers, not companies, should control the process,\u201d he added. Europe\u2019s GDPR already allows this to some extent, as will California\u2019s incoming privacy law. But the rest of the U.S. is out of luck unless the measures are pushed out federally.\n\nAnd, lastly, Glueck said anyone collecting location data should promise to \u201cdo no harm.\u201d By that, he said companies should apply privacy-protecting measures to all data uses by not discriminating against individuals based on their religion, sexual orientation or political beliefs. That would make it illegal for family tracking apps, for example, to secretly pass on location data to healthcare or insurance providers who might use that data to hike up a person\u2019s premiums above normal rates by monitoring their driving speeds, he said.\n\nFor a business that relies on location data, it\u2019s a gutsy move.\n\nBut Glueck hinted that businesses like Foursquare would be less directly affected as they already take a more measured and mindful approach to privacy, whereas the fast and loose players in the location data industry would face greater scrutiny and more enforcement action.\n\n\u201cThese steps are necessary, but they\u2019re not sufficient,\u201d said Glueck. But he warned that Congress could do \u201cgreat damage\u201d if lawmakers fail to sufficiently push overly burdensome regulations on smaller companies, which could increase overheads, put companies out of business and have a negative effect on competition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no good reason that companies won\u2019t be able to comply with reasonable regulation,\u201d said Glueck.\n\n\u201cComprehensive regulation will support future innovation, weed out the bad companies and earn the public trust,\u201d he said.", "description": "The chief executive of Foursquare, one of the largest location data platforms on the internet, is calling on lawmakers to pass legislation to better regulate the wider location data industry amid abuses and misuses of consumers\u2019 personal data.
