He was subsequently sued by Wolfgang Puck, another steakhouse owner, for calling his new restaurants 'Wolfgang's Steakhouse'.\n\nStaff at Peter Luger, who are famously difficult to get a hold of due to their long-held but recently abolished no online reservations policy, could not be reached. There was no answer at the Brooklyn restaurant's main phone line on Tuesday.\n\nThe restaurant sits beneath the Williamsburg Bridge and has attracted well-heeled steak fans from Manhattan for decades.\n\nIt opened in 1887, when it was known as Carl Luger\u2019s Caf\u00e9, Billiards and Bowling Alley.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger\n\nOwner Peter Luger owned the restaurant but it was named after his nephew, Carl.\n\nIt was taken over in 1920 by Sol Forman, a local businessman and grew over years to become known as one of if not the best steakhouse in the five boroughs.\n\nThe restaurant boasts one Michelin star and without fail has a line of diners, even those who have reservations, at the door every day.\n\nBut, Wells writes, it has lost its charm and is no longer worth its exorbitant prices.\n\nSteak for two, for example, is $109 A side dish of sliced tomatoes and onions is $16.95 and its famous thick bacon is $6.95-a-slice.\n\n'I don\u2019t remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time,' he writes, explanation that he has been visiting the restaurant since the 1990s when he would happily shell-out once a year for a life-changing steak there.\n\n'Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren\u2019t greeted; they\u2019re processed...\n\nThe menu at Peter Luger where steak for two costs $109 and a side of raw, sliced tomato and onion is $16.95\n\nThe restaurant's facade. There is almost always a line inside, even for those with a reservation\n\nThe restaurant is best known for its porterhouse steak. But Wells described it as being unevenly cooked and far from the best cut of meat in New York City\n\n'There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall.\n\nNew York Times food critic Pete Wells\n\n'A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes.\n\n'The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger,' he writes.\n\nThe problems do not end at the line, either, according to Wells who also says the once 'charmingly brusque' waiters are now simply rude and disengaged.\n\n'The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that\u2019s standing between them and a hard-earned nap,' he wrote.\n\nWells also said the food was sub par.\n\n'The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish...Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery?'\n\nThe meat, he said, was also nothing to write home about.\n\nNew Yorkers rejoiced in Wells' scathing criticism of the restaurant\n\n'What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it\u2019s just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer,' he wrote.\n\nNew Yorkers and tourists who have eaten at the restaurant rejoiced in Wells' critique of it on Twitter.\n\nSome said they had long held the same view that it was overpriced and overrated but that it had once been worth the hype.\n\nOthers said they experienced the poor service and mediocre food Wells' described in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThey listed their other favorites, 4 Charles Prime Rib, Keens, The Beatrice Inn, whereas some said the steaks they eat in Nebraska for $20 were preferable.\n\nPeter Luger, which is still owned by the Forman family, has not addressed the bad review.\n\nIt remains on the Michelin one-star list.", "description": "The Times' food critic Pete Wells described the restaurant as an overpriced 'scam' where customers are treated rudely by staff and 'processed' at the front door.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20344978-0-image-a-2_1572380808971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
