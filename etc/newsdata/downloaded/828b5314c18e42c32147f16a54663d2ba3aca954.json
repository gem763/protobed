DID IT, RACHEL MADDOW WOULD BE ALL OVER IT\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Maher explained that, \u201cWe live in an age where people want to cancel other people and disappear them\u201d instead of listening to someone who holds another point of view. He blamed the Baby Boomers for raising the next generation of millennials who with the advent of Twitter rally against \u201canything that upsets their tender sensibilities.\u201d\n\nBILL MAHER CALLS OUT MADDOW OVER UKRAINE COVERAGE\n\n\u201cI was woke before some of these people were born. I grew up in a household with two liberal parents who were ahead of their time. My father and mother told me about civil rights. I knew what the right thing was. The difference is that liberals protect people, and P.C. people protect feelings. They don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said in an interview titled \u201cBill Maher on the perils of political correctness.\u201d\n\nMaher admitted he\u2019s strummed up his own controversies both early on in his career in his stand-up comic days and more recently. He pointed out with the new age of social media anyone can post a video online and unleash the millennial mob against them.\n\n\u201cThe politically correct people are not concerned about social justice. They care about putting scalps on the wall,\u201d Maher continued. \u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of desire for people to talk to each other, to accept that, 'O.K., this person doesn\u2019t agree with me on a lot of stuff, but I don\u2019t have to think he\u2019s a monster.' We want to beat our chests and vanquish the other side. Compromise seems like a dead concept.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHe also claimed that society has evolved when it comes to talking about a variety of issues, including terrorism, Islamophobia, the LGBTQ community, women and race. But now \u201cwe\u2019re not getting to the truth, because we\u2019re too sensitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we at this place where we can\u2019t admit that we\u2019ve ever had bad thoughts and gotten over them and become a better person? You can\u2019t judge today by yesterday. We evolve.\u201d", "description": "Bill Maher railed against the so-called Twitter mob in an interview published Monday, saying that millennial cancel culture silences those who don\u2019t speak to \u201cone true opinion\u201d and the politically correct only \u201cprotect feelings.\"", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Bill-Maher-HBO1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
