We may want a war over, we may even declare it over. You can pull your troops out, as President Obama learned the hard way out of Iraq, but the enemy gets a vote, we say in the military. If we don\u2019t keep pressure on, then ISIS will resurge. It\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back,\" Mattis said.", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:22:16AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/294/1ec6bb54-9e49-454e-bfa5-1cdbd66672ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
