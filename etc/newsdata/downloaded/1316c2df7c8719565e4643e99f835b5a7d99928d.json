Alongside their music, both artists boast multiple film, television, and fashion projects, with brands clamoring to work with them.\n\nBut it hasn't been an easy path to the top. Not only did both women have to fight for success in a notoriously male-dominated industry, but they have also constantly been pitted against one another.\n\nIn a trailer for the upcoming episode of E! True Hollywood Story, hip hop artist Da Brat states: 'In this industry there's only room for one woman at the top.'\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nCardi B (right) and Nicki Minaj (left) have become rap royalty, but it hasn't been an easy path to the top in an industry that is dominated by men\n\nDiscussing how record labels encourage rivalry between female artists, Dr Oneka LaBennett, associate professor of Africana Studies at Cornell, adds: 'They want to see a catfight.'\n\nThe episode - titled Does Hip Hop Reject Women? - will discuss how this rivalry is just one element of struggle that female rappers have to contend with in an industry that often sees women as disposable.\n\nAs hip hop has emerged as a multi-billion dollar business and a dominant force in pop culture over the past five decades, female rappers have been faced with an uphill battle to break into the industry.\n\nThe show will look at the struggles faced by rappers including Queen Latifah, Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott, who demanded respect in the early 90s, as well as those such as Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim, who flaunted their sexuality and vied for the 'Queen Bee' status.\n\nLil' Kim (left) and Foxy Brown (right) are another pair of female rappers who found themselves positioned as rivals when they both rose to fame in the 1990s\n\nEven now, record labels are still showing reluctance to sign women, and the overwhelming majority of high-earning hip hop artists are men. Yet both Cardi B and Nicki Minaj have managed to break down these barriers.\n\nE! True Hollywood Story will look at how the rappers used social media to create a following and a voice for themselves when other female artists have been silenced.\n\nAnd against this backdrop, it will examine how emerging artists - such as Young M.A., Rapsody and Lizzo, who are only just breaking into the industry - are creating a new space for themselves as women in hip hop.\n\nE!
