The boy was blown into churning storm surge and is among thousands of people missing, many of them children, after the worst hurricane to hit the Bahamas.\n\nIt was one of many harrowing stories emerging on Thursday as residents searched for loved ones and widespread looting was reported on the islands, where the United Nations estimates 70,000 people are in immediate need of food, water and shelter.\n\nAn international relief effort was trying to overcome formidable logistical challenges to help the Bahamas, where the health minister predicted a \u201cstaggering\u201d death toll from Hurricane Dorian, now churning northward off the coast of South Carolina.\n\n\u201cI guess within seconds the gusts of the wind blew the little boy off the roof into the water,\u201d Johnson said of his brother. \u201cGiven the circumstances, I\u2019m not that hopeful.\u201d\n\nAerial video of the Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas, worst hit by the then-Category 5 hurricane, showed widespread devastation, with the harbour, shops and workplaces, a hospital and airport landing strips damaged or decimated.\n\nThe death toll from Dorian stood at 30 on Thursday evening, officials told CNN, The final toll is expected to be much higher.\n\n\u201cLet me say that I believe the number will be staggering,\u201d Health Minister Duane Sands was quoted by The Nassau Guardian as telling Guardian radio. \u201c... I have never lived through anything like this and I don\u2019t want to live through anything like this again.\u201d\n\nDorian turned a shantytown known as The Mud near Marsh Harbour into shredded wreckage, with bodies believed to be still below the ruins, based on the smell coming from the debris, according to a Reuters photographer who visited the area.\n\nThe photographer witnessed widespread looting in Marsh Harbour, seeing residents breaking into liquor stores and supermarkets, carrying off goods in bags or filling their vehicles.\n\n$7 BILLION IN DAMAGE\n\nThe U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said on Thursday it was organising an airlift from Panama of storage units, generators and prefab offices for two logistics hubs, as well as satellite equipment for emergency responders, and has bought eight metric tonnes of ready-to-eat meals.\n\nThe U.N. agency has allocated $5.4 million to a three-month emergency operation to support 39,000 people, said WFP Senior Spokesperson Herv\u00e9 Verhoosel.\n\nA flight from the U.S. Agency for International Development landed early on Thursday with enough relief supplies to help 31,500 people, bringing hygiene kits, water containers and buckets, plastic sheeting and chain saws.\n\nTotal insured and uninsured losses in the Bahamas amounted to $7 billion, including buildings and business interruptions, according to a preliminary estimate by Karen Clark & Co, a consultancy that provides catastrophic modelling and risk management services.\n\nWith telephones down in many areas, residents posted lists of missing loved ones on social media. One Facebook post by media outlet Our News Bahamas had 2,500 comments, mainly listing lost family members.\n\nOne survivor on the Abaco Islands, Ramond King, said he watched as swirling winds ripped the roof off his house, then churned to a neighbour\u2019s home to pluck the entire structure into the sky.\n\nA destroyed boat is seen at a marina after Hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, September 5, 2019. REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\n\u201c\u2018This can\u2019t be real, this can\u2019t be real\u2019,\u201d King recalled thinking. \u201cNothing is here, nothing at all. Everything is gone, just bodies.\u201d\n\nRELIEF EFFORTS\n\nThe Netherlands\u2019 ambassador to the United Nations tweeted the country was sending two naval ships with supplies from St Maarten, a Dutch island about 1,100 miles (1,770 km) southeast of the Bahamas.\n\nJamaica was sending a 150-member military contingent to help secure Abaco and Grand Bahama, officials said.\n\nVolunteers also ferried supplies to the islands in a flotilla of small boats.\n\nCruise lines responded as well.\n\nThe Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line said it would transport first responders, medics and journalists for free to Freeport on Thursday, returning to Florida on Friday with any Bahamians who have documents to enter the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a humanitarian trip. We\u2019re also taking donations that have arrived in the port (in Palm Beach),\u201d said Francisco Sanchez, a sales representative for the cruise line.\n\nRoyal Caribbean\u2019s Empress of the Seas said it was delivering 10,000 meals of chicken, rice and fruit to Grand Bahama.\n\nSlideshow (42 Images)\n\nDorian hovered over the Bahamas for nearly two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-metre) storm surges.\n\nOn Thursday, the storm was barrelling north-northeast just off the southeastern U.S. coast, moving at about 7 miles per hour (11 kph), with maximum sustained winds fluctuating between 110 and 115 mph (175-185 kph), between a Category 2 and Category 3 storm on the five-point Saffir-Simpson wind scale.", "description": "Richard Johnson said his six-year-old brother Adrian was just too small to withstand Hurricane Dorian.
