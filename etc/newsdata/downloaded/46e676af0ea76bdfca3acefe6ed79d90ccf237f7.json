Leicestershire Police told CNN that the investigation into the incident has been completed and no charges have been made.\n\n\"It was disgusting, hearing all those chants,\" Harris told CNN. \"As I've looked round to the referee, he's waiting for me to take it (the penalty). As I've run up, he (the fan) sang: You black ...' singing slur.\n\n\"After that it all got heated. I asked the referee: 'Did you hear that? Can you deal with that?' He said he'd not heard anything. That was from just behind the goal.\n\n\"Meanwhile, there's one on the halfway line as well, in the stands, and after I've gone in for a challenge, that's when I've heard: 'Typical black man, ruin it for everybody.'\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What can be done about racism in soccer?

I just wanted a bit of support from the ref because that's who you can look to on the pitch and after it carried on, I felt a bit empty.\n\nJUST WATCHED Tammy Abraham: My mum 'was in tears' from racist abuse Replay More Videos ...

It didn't feel like football when I was on the pitch.\"\n\nHarris says the man who racially abused him continued to harass his family, following them around the ground for more than half an hour.\n\n\"He's making these noises, referring to me as an animal,\" he recalls. \"A lot can happen in half an hour, what if he'd got violent towards my family members?\n\n\"They got told to remove themselves from the ground and, to me, that's racism because the linesman has heard it and witnesses in the stands are saying: 'He's being racist' but they're telling my family members to get out.\"\n\nHarris says incidents such as these are common in English amateur football.\n\nAccording to Kick It Out, a UK organization that works to tackle discrimination in professional and grassroots football, reports of discrimination rose by 32% in 2018/19 compared to the previous season.\n\nRacism remains the most common form of discrimination and has risen \"alarmingly,\" Kick It Out says, with reports increasing by 43%.\n\n\"In professional football, you've got big grounds, thousands of supporters, police,\" Harris says. \"But in ours (amateur), you can be racist. He could find out where you're playing the next game, he can just walk through the gate, stand around the side and give it to you again.\n\n\"The only support -- well he should be the support -- is the referee that's standing on the pitch, but he's on his own. So they can follow you wherever you go.\"\n\nRacism on the rise\n\nBut the rise in incidents of racism at football matches is just a microcosm of British society as whole.\n\nIn October, a UK government report revealed there has been an increase in hate crimes for a sixth consecutive year. Since 2012/13, the number of hate crimes reported by police has more than doubled.\n\nOver the past two seasons, high-profile incidents involving Raheem Sterling, Romelu Lukaku and the England national team have served as ugly reminders that racism remains entrenched within the sport.\n\nOnly last week, the manager of non-league side Haringey Borough decided to pull his team off the pitch after his goalkeeper was allegedly racially abused and spat at by opposition fans during an FA Cup qualifying match against Yeovil Town.\n\nJUST WATCHED Racism in football causes FA Cup qualifier to be rescheduled Replay More Videos ...

It's everywhere,\" Harris says of the incident. \"But (it gave me) the same emotions, you just want it to stop but it's not going to stop.\n\n\"The first thing you think of is the person that went through it (being) alone. I'm sorry they went through it -- but there's going to be more people going through it.\n\n\"I just hope he gets the support he deserves.\"\n\nWhether at the highest level or down at grassroots, racism in football sadly, inevitably, shows no signs of ending.", "description": "\"We got awarded a penalty ... and I heard shouts: 'You black b******,'\" Linford Harris recalls.", "authors": ["Matias Grez", "Darren Lewis", "Zayn Nabbi"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191028164724-linford-harris-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
