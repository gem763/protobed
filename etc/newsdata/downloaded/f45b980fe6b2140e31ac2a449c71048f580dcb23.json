Johnson Demands EU Back Down as U.K. Is Ready for No-Deal Brexit\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson outlined his plan for a new Brexit agreement and warned the European Union to compromise or watch the U.K. walk away from talks and leave the bloc without a deal.\n\nThe U.K. prime minister declared that Britain is \u201cready\u201d to break away from the EU without an agreement in four weeks\u2019 time, if officials in Brussels do not back down.\n\nIn his first keynote speech as prime minister at his Conservative Party\u2019s conference, Johnson said his team is putting forward details of his \u201cconstructive and reasonable\u201d blueprint in Brussels on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn,\u201d Johnson told his audience in Manchester, England, on Wednesday. \u201cBecause if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal.\n\n\u201cThat is not an outcome we want. It is not an outcome we seek at all. But let me tell you this conference: it is an outcome for which we are ready.\u201d\n\nThe U.K. is due to exit the EU on Oct. 31 and Johnson says he will never agree to delaying Brexit beyond that date, even if it means leaving without an agreement, risking disruption at ports, to business supply chains, and to the security of food, fuel and water supplies.\n\nIn a Sun newspaper interview, Johnson set the bloc\u2019s negotiators an Oct. 11 deadline for agreeing a headline deal with Britain.\n\nIn his speech, Johnson gave few details of his blueprint for resolving the toxic question of how to avoid the need for checkpoints to inspect goods crossing the Irish border, which has held up progress in the negotiations for the past year.\n\nHe said his plan is a \u201ccompromise.\u201d It involves a common set of rules for agriculture across the island of Ireland, no customs checks on goods crossing the Irish border \u201cat or near\u201d that frontier, and a \u201crenewable\u201d process in which the Northern Ireland elected assembly gives its consent to the system in operation.\n\nThere are few signs that European leaders are willing to accept Johnson\u2019s proposals. Ireland, a key voice on the EU side, has already rejected elements of the plan.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, before the prime minister\u2019s speech, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the proposals did not appear encouraging. \u201cEssentially, if he\u2019s proposing customs checks on the island of Ireland then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the basis of an agreement,\u201d he told Sky News.", "description": "Johnson Demands EU Back Down as U.K. Is Ready for No-Deal Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF1A14U_L.jpg"}
