He\u2019s certainly moderate and not likely to be a guy delivering some major social revolution. Do you think he\u2019s too old?\n\nIn my capacity as a person who\u2019s been writing a book about older women, I have to say it\u2019s interesting that of the three 70-something candidates running for the Democratic nomination, Warren is the only one for whom it doesn\u2019t seem to be a major issue.\n\nThe obvious reason is that Warren is racing around like an overachieving bee. While Bernie is recovering from a heart attack and Biden is making appearances in which he reminds me of a very friendly 15-year-old golden retriever.\n\nBret: Golden retrievers are good at all ages.\n\nGail: I\u2019ve always had a theory that when people age, barring health crises, they simply become more like whatever they were at 40. Warren sort of undercuts this \u2014 she\u2019s much more personable, politically astute, with a stronger public presence than when she first emerged on the political scene. But Biden is that same friendly pol who likes to work the system. Maybe more so. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s always failed trying for the nomination in the past \u2014 he just doesn\u2019t seem to have the makings of a great No. 1.\n\nHowever, if he wins the nomination, do not remind me of all this in the fall. Then he\u2019d be the only thing standing between us and four more years of Donald Trump, and I guarantee I will find a ton of great qualities to admire.\n\nBret: I would gladly vote for Biden. He is a respecter of our institutions, and that\u2019s something the country dearly needs now. What he lacks in ideological ambition and rhetorical nimbleness he more than makes up for in human decency and political good sense. He cares about America\u2019s place in the world and will mend fences with our allies. He has experienced the kind of personal tragedy that hardens a person\u2019s will and softens the heart. He will surround himself with sensible advisers. I won\u2019t agree with them much of the time, but I will rest easy knowing they aren\u2019t likely to make catastrophic mistakes like the Kurdish fiasco. For all of his manifest flaws, he can restore the country\u2019s emotional balance, which is no small thing after four years of Trump-astrophe.\n\nAnd, most important, I think he can win a general election, which is why Trump went to such sneaky and discreditable lengths to smear him.", "description": "While Trump divides the world.", "authors": ["Gail Collins", "Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/opinion/15conversationWeb/15conversationWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
