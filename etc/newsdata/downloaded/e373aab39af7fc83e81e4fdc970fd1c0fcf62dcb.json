Sign up here.\n\nThe outlook on Portugal\u2019s government bond rating was revised to positive from stable by S&P Global Ratings, reflecting its view that the country is better equipped to service its external obligations.\n\nThe New York-based credit-ranking company in March raised the rating to BBB from BBB-, with a stable outlook.\n\n\u201cSteps taken by the European Central Bank since 2012 to ensure the singleness of monetary policy within the euro area, and to eliminate the risk of an external refinancing shock, have supported Portugal\u2019s export-led recovery,\u201d S&P said in a statement late on Friday.\n\nTourism has boosted the Portuguese economy, which expanded for a fifth consecutive year in 2018. That\u2019s helped the country\u2019s minority Socialist government, which faces a general election in October, to lower the jobless rate and manage the budget deficit.\n\nS&P forecasts economic growth will slow to 1.8% this year from 2.1% in 2018.\n\nWhile the budget deficit has narrowed and borrowing costs have plunged since the euro crisis, Portugal\u2019s debt burden as a percentage of gross domestic product remains the third-highest in the euro area behind Greece and Italy. The government aims to narrow the budget deficit to 0.2% of GDP this year, and sees the debt ratio falling to 118.6%.\n\nThe outlook on Portugal\u2019s government bond rating was also changed to positive by Moody\u2019s Investors Service in August.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, all the credit rating firms have a positive outlook, which indicates that in the short term there may be improvements in the rating,\u2019\u2019 Finance Minister Mario Centeno told reporters in Helsinki on Saturday before a meeting with his European Union counterparts.\n\nPortugal\u2019s 10-year bond yield was at 0.3% on Friday. It peaked at 18% in 2012 at the height of the euro region\u2019s debt crisis.\n\n(Adds comment from finance minister in seventh paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Joao Lima in Lisbon at jlima1@bloomberg.net;Vishal Persaud in Seattle at vpersaud1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, Sebastian Tong, Kati Pohjanpalo\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0The outlook on Portugal\u2019s government bond rating was revised to positive from stable by S&P Global Ratings, reflecting its view that the country is better equipped to service its external", "authors": ["Joao Lima", "Vishal Persaud"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
