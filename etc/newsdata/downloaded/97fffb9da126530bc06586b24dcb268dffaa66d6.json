REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets, which have in recent months veered toward market-sensitive topics such as trade and monetary policy, have increasingly moved U.S. rates markets, analyst Munier Salem said in a note on Friday.\n\nIn the report, which runs well over 4,000 words, J.P. Morgan analysts use machine learning techniques and their own volatility model to show how the president\u2019s 280-character missives served to raise investors\u2019 expectations for future moves in the U.S. rates market.\n\nWhile the direction of price moves and their lasting power may be uncertain, Trump\u2019s tweets often spark a sharp reaction across asset classes.\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s newly built \u201cVolfefe\u201d index - a nod to \u201ccovfefe,\u201d the mysterious word coined by Trump in an unfinished 2017 tweet - analyzes a rolling sample of recent tweets to judge how much effect the president\u2019s remarks have had on volatility.\n\nThe index can explain a measurable fraction of moves in the market\u2019s forecast of likely movement in rates, particularly the shorter duration 2-year and 5-year rates, the analysts said.\n\nTrump\u2019s most market-moving tweets dwell on trade, and, to a lesser extent, monetary policy, with the words \u201cChina,\u201d \u201cbillion,\u201d \u201cproducts,\u201d \u201cdollars,\u201d \u201ctariffs\u201d and \u201ctrade\u201d making the top list, the JP Morgan analysis found.\n\nTo be sure, while market-moving tweets may be on the rise, in recent months, these tweets have garnered fewer likes and retweets than other contemporaneous remarks, the analysts found.\n\nAnalysts at JP Morgan noted that while their current analysis was limited to U.S. interest rates, such an exercise was easily transferable to equity or currency markets.\n\nSeparately, analysts at Citigroup found that a wide range of currency pairs logged higher-than-expected volatility within a one-hour window after a Trump tweet.\n\nThe U.S. dollar - whose recent strength against major currencies has drawn much of the president\u2019s ire - weakening against the euro and the Japanese yen is the most pronounced reaction to the president\u2019s tweets about the greenback, analysts at Citigroup said in a Friday note.", "description": "Traders know that when President Donald Trump tweets he can rock financial markets, often in unpredictable ways, but analysts at JP Morgan have now quantified the impact of his tweets, at least on the U.S. interest rates market.", "authors": ["Saqib Iqbal Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428033727&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881JC", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
