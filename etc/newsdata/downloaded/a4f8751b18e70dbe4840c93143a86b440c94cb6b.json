Marie\u2019s slow David-versus-Goliath skirmish with the justice system thuds on. Duvall and Rasmussen dive down more and more rabbit holes, hoping to pull out any kind of useful intel. And the victims pile up. Now, including Marie, there are four women with incredibly similar attack stories. This might be the moment where a series hits a lull, turns procedural. And in some ways, Unbelievable has done that \u2014 the detectives sit around conference tables, rifle through documents, pour over databases. But there\u2019s some magic seasoning bubbling up in the broth of this show, infusing everything around it with a sense of freshness. Maybe it\u2019s the novelty of a crew of hyperintelligent women given the freedom to be brainy and emotional and tough all at once. Or perhaps it\u2019s the way Marie\u2019s story manages to find new depths of misunderstanding and injustice for us to shake our heads at. Either way, I can\u2019t stop watching (and not just because I\u2019m writing these recaps).\n\nOn crime shows like this, the FBI usually comes stomping into the scene, demanding the case be handed over and upselling their fancy federally funded gadgets. But in this case, Agent Taggert (Scott Lawrence, who was born to play a federal agent with an imposing but silky voice) is happy to sit back and see what he can do to help Rasmussen and Duvall. And the FBI\u2019s toys, well, yet again they aren\u2019t worth much if the information entered isn\u2019t fleshed out. So Taggert can only do so much. He offers the use of ViCap (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program), but says it might not be horrible since, as any viewer of Hannibal or Mindhunter might know, this rapist is only \u201cgarden-variety horrible,\u201d i.e., he doesn\u2019t eat anyone or store women\u2019s heads in his freezer. And again, Duvall brings up the fact that for some reason rapes aren\u2019t processed as dutifully as murders. (Sigh.)\n\nOf course, the problem here is that at any moment this rapist might turn into a murderer. The time gaps between his victims are growing smaller and smaller. First he waited months, then weeks, now he could strike again at any time. He started with a knife, then said he had a gun, and with Amber he actually pointed one at her head. There are two ways this could go. \u201cA guy who\u2019s jonesing might not be as careful,\u201d or he could just let loose and actually pull the trigger. Duvall, ever the optimist, offers a third option: They could catch him before he strikes again.\n\nSo it\u2019s back to the databases and the scant info they have on this. Rasmussen still isn\u2019t willing to let anyone outside their team in on the fact that they think the rapist might be a cop (her worry that the force will entirely box out \u201cthe two lady cops\u201d sounds alarmingly accurate), but it\u2019s the best angle they have. Mia, god bless her creative soul, has asked for a list of cops who applied for a military credit, using the wonderful excuse that they\u2019re trying to put together a \u201cVeterans Day honors\u201d list. But a quick scan of former military who also have a record comes up with nada. (Though admittedly, it did bug me that they assumed he\u2019d have a record: why couldn\u2019t this be a former serviceman who hasn\u2019t gotten caught?) Next up is officers with domestic abuse history, a pretty big tell when it comes to other deviant behaviors. Too bad there isn\u2019t a chance in hell that anyone is going to wander into their conference room and plop such valuable, secret information in their laps.\n\nA local college kid with a conscience is around, however, and his gut is propelling him to tell the police about a guy he knows from his campus. One of those flyers that Rasmussen derides as useless has encouraged Arturo to visit the Golden P.D. \u2014 he knows somebody who may be \u201cof interest.\u201d His conversation with Duvall is artfully constructed. Arturo doesn\u2019t spill the beans immediately, and wiggles his way around explaining exactly why he thinks Scott Parrish, local douchebag, might have committed Amber\u2019s rape. \u201cThis is kinda what he does,\u201d Arturo explains. Scott, a real charmer, forces girls to have sex, takes drunk unconsenting women upstairs at frat parties, and in general has the moral code of an orc. But Arturo recoils when Duvall uses the word rape: His brain doesn\u2019t connect what Scott does with such a loaded term, even though, well, that\u2019s precisely what rape is.\n\nIt turns out that Scott was arrested a couple of years prior for sexual assault. The case didn\u2019t lead to a conviction, but a quick glimpse through Facebook (a tool police use more frequently than most of us would imagine) turns up a photo of Scott with a girl tossed over his shoulder and a blurry dark spot on his left calf that bears an uncanny resemblance to the birthmark Amber reported seeing on her rapist\u2019s leg. (The photo is also captioned \u2014 and I cringed for his sake while writing this \u2014 \u201cSup ladies?\u201d College-age people, the dating scene does get better with age. I promise.) Amber can\u2019t positively ID him, but this is the first real suspect with promise.\n\nIn person, Scott turns out to be even more of a mouth breather than we imagined he could be. Duvall\u2019s interrogation strategy \u2014 to give him just enough rope to hang himself with \u2014 seems at first to be working. He can explain away his prior arrest, saying that he \u201cgot with the wrong girl.\u201d And he has a universal sociological theory for why he, an otherwise upstanding young gentleman who just sometimes roofies girls, keeps getting accused of rape. \u201cIt happens all the time now,\u201d he says. \u201cGirls making all these claims, it\u2019s a thing. There\u2019s status to being a victim, which is bullshit because there are real victims out there and when you go around saying you have been victimized when you haven\u2019t \u2026\u201d Oh yes, Scott is highly concerned for the real victims and not just the handful of women he\u2019s penetrated without their consent. What a gem.\n\nScott is looking more and more like a possible suspect. He can\u2019t quite come up with solid alibis and his personality isn\u2019t exactly tipping the scales in his favor. Alas, when he finally pulls up his pant leg, instead of a birthmark there is a truly heinous pine tree tattoo. Scott\u2019s a rapist, but he most likely isn\u2019t Amber\u2019s rapist. (Still hoping Merritt Wever nails him to the wall!)\n\nBut other leads are coming together. Mia\u2019s gang of pool-playing, beer-swigging, all-female cops (How do I join this group? Please send me an application. My personal essay is prepared.) have a host of other reports to share with the Golden and Westminster police departments. Most intriguingly, one offers the story of a B&E and attempted assault. Investigators picked up a shoe print (new info), and the guy was wearing a mask that sounds quite similar to Amber and Doris and Sarah\u2019s (and Marie\u2019s) rapist. This woman wasn\u2019t raped, the detective says admiringly, because she dove headfirst off her balcony, racking up a cracked pelvis and a broken leg in the process.\n\nThat woman is Lilly, and it turns out that the police have entirely neglected to follow up on her case for the past year. This woman hurled her own body out of a second-story window to escape an attacker, but she can\u2019t get the cops to make much of an effort. Lilly\u2019s mother, who is cat-sitting while her daughter is on a spiritual retreat, is rightfully infuriated. Police ineptitude, it turns out, is mostly due to indifference. If the arrest isn\u2019t easy, the cops disappear, and while women like Lilly are left in pain and traumatized, their cases quietly slip over the horizon. But Duvall especially is able to impress upon Lilly\u2019s mom that they are truly following up with good intentions. It helps that she doesn\u2019t have a hint of the wise-cracking cop gene and handles the information that Lilly is a Druid with genuine grace. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019d want to do is come between her and her worship,\u201d she offers. \u201cWhen the Spirit releases her, ask her to give us a call.\u201d\n\nFor both detectives, this episode ends with an obliteration of boundaries. Rasmussen breaks down and asks her husband/partner (it\u2019s not entirely clear if they\u2019re married) to use his role as an investigator at the attorney general\u2019s office to sneak her glimpses of Internal Affairs files on domestically abusive cops. When he (rightfully) declines, she blows a gasket \u2014 and yes that is a car pun. Duvall has become so fixated on this white Mazda that when she spots one on the highway she doesn\u2019t just pull over the driver, she draws her weapon and orders his hands on the wheel. Instead of staring down a rapist, however, she just terrifies a grandfather.\n\nAs for Marie\u2019s situation, well, if you aren\u2019t hurling your remote in frustration at how the system jerks her around, I\u2019m concerned you might be a sociopath. Somehow, the only criminal in all this \u2014 including Scott, who is a composite character of about a dozen guys I knew at college who are all ironically attorneys now \u2014 is Marie, who gets sucked up into even more bureaucratic bullshit when her local court mails her criminal citation to one address and a notice for her hearing to another. Now there\u2019s a warrant out for her arrest, and Marie, whose life keeps backsliding to new Sisyphean lows, is freaking out.\n\nOddly enough, it\u2019s two plain old bureaucrats who kick into action to help Marie: first, a kindly office worker who must see the tears about to splash down Marie\u2019s face, and then Mr. Hughes, a typically bedraggled public defender who has Marie foisted on him. She\u2019s been in and out of foster care, most likely been the subject of judge\u2019s orders for well over a decade, but still, this nameless, faceless system sucks her in. How could Marie possibly know how to find an attorney? Or that pleading not guilty when she knows she has lied to the police (about not lying, ironically) isn\u2019t just another crime stacked on top of the pile?\n\nIt\u2019s a dizzying set of circumstances. Police have decided to press charges for a crime that Marie only committed when pressured to do so by police \u2014 and for a crime (filing a false report) that they hardly ever press charges over. For Marie, who learned from an early age that keeping her head down is the best option when people in power dominate her, keeping up the \u201cgold star\u201d behavior that Mr. Hughes encourages is rock-solid advice. She sees a way out of this godforsaken tunnel, and will stick to that path no matter what.\n\nWhich is why when she\u2019s finally reassured that she\u2019s going to get a plea deal, that the judge won\u2019t put her in jail \u201cfor one mistake\u201d (ha!), she keeps that tack, despite the news story that could exonerate her of this false report charge and lead police to reopen her case. Marie doesn\u2019t even think she can trust herself, let alone the system that\u2019s failed her for her entire life.", "description": "Marie doesn\u2019t even think she can trust herself, let alone the system that\u2019s failed her for her entire life.
