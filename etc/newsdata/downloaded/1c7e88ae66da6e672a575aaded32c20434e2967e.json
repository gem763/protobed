That\u2019s even though face-painted Iranian women have cheered for their team abroad for years, despite the 1981 ban that followed the country\u2019s Islamic Revolution.\n\n\u201cWe are so happy that finally we got the chance to go to the stadium. It\u2019s an extraordinary feeling,\u201d said Zahra Pashaei, a 29-year-old nurse who has only known soccer games from television. \u201cAt least for me, 22 or 23 years of longing and regret lies behind this.\u201d\n\nIranian Women's fans react during the FIFA World Cup Qualifier match between Iran and Cambodia at Azadi Stadium on October 10, 2019 in Tehran, Iran.

Iran in the second half was up 10-0 over Cambodia. Iranian state television, which long has been controlled by hard-liners in the Islamic Republic, aired footage of women cheering and commentators even acknowledged their presence.\n\nWhile Iran for years has considered letting women into soccer matches, the decision to allow them in Thursday came as part of intense pressure from FIFA, the world body governing the sport. Iran faced a potential ban if it didn\u2019t allow women into the match.\n\nThat pressure has grown both with FIFA and Iran\u2019s soccer-loving public since September, when an Iranian woman detained for dressing as a man to sneak into a soccer stadium to watch a match died after setting herself on fire upon learning she learned she could spend six months in prison.\n\nThe self-immolation death of 29-year-old Sahar Khodayari, who became known as the \u201cBlue Girl\u201d for her love of the Iranian team Esteghlal, shocked Iranian officials and the public, becoming an immediate hashtag trend across social media in the Islamic Republic.\n\nAn Iranian security guard (R) watches as Iranian women cheer during the FIFIA World Cup qualification match between Iran and Cambodia, at the Azadi stadium in Tehran, Iran 10 October 2019.

Saudi Arabia recently began allowing women into soccer matches in the kingdom.\n\nHard-liners and traditional Shiite clerics, citing their own interpretation of Islamic law, believe in segregating men and women at public events, as well as keeping women out of men\u2019s sports. They\u2019ve maintained tight control on social mores in the times since the Islamic Revolution, which saw women required to cover their hair and also wear the black, all-encompassing chador while working in government jobs.\n\nThe effort to allow women back into stadiums has gone through fits and starts since the revolution. Iran even barred a woman from holding a sign for the country when it attends its first Summer Olympics in 1986 in South Korea. A group of Irish women received special permission to attend a qualifier between Iran and Ireland in Tehran in 2001.\n\nIn 2006, former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wanted women to attend matches to \u201cimprove soccer-watching manners and promote a healthy atmosphere.\u201d However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, opposed the decision.\n\nAn Iranian woman attends the World Cup Qatar 2022 Group C qualification football match between Iran and Cambodia at the Azadi stadium in the capital Tehran on October 10, 2019.

Amnesty International called the decision \u201ca cynical publicity stunt by the authorities intended to whitewash their image.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of taking half-hearted steps to address their discriminatory treatment of women who want to watch football, the Iranian authorities should lift all restrictions on women attending football matches, including domestic league games, across the country,\u201d said Philip Luther, Amnesty\u2019s Middle East and North Africa research and advocacy director.\n\nStill, many in Iran embraced the move, like shopkeeper Amir Ali Bagheri, who sold the nurse Pashaei a new Team Melli jersey ahead of the match.\n\n\u201cThey (women) are so excited they are going to the stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cGod willing, there will be freedom sooner so that they can attend all matches, not just the national team matches. That will be much better.\u201d\n\nContributing: Jon Gambrell, Associated Press", "description": "A female soccer fan died in September.
