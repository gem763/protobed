Courtesy of Hana Hong\n\nBy the time Friday rolled around, I was just relieved that the experiment was over. Although it was slightly difficult to stomach the meals, I was able to eat them rather quickly with a renewed sense of gratitude. I don't know if it was my newfound adrenaline rush or my body adjusting to the intake, but I felt better than the previous days had made me feel. Luckily, I was able to indulge myself in a Bibim Men, an instant noodle pack that is classified as ramen but definitely tastes less like it due to the fact that it has no soup; I downed it with a side of applesauce and some cucumber slices. Ultimately, I was eager for my first trip to Taco Bell; I was craving a beef burrito like no other. (If you're in the mood for Mexican, try these 15 easy Mexican appetizers at home.)\n\nMy results were both as predicted and quite surprising. One thing I noticed was that the effects were not just physical; I got incredibly moody and would snap at things that I would normally hold my tongue at (major thanks to my boyfriend for tolerating my unpredictable mood swings). The smallest things would annoy me, and I felt myself feeling irritable and cranky during the day.\n\nAt night, all I wanted to do was collapse. Although my body felt thoroughly comatose and unresponsive by the end of the week, I actually ended up losing four pounds (despite the alarming amount of carbs and calories I was consuming). It wasn't exactly what I would deem an enjoyable, fun-filled week, but it was quite informative knowing my body could take to (and even potentially adjust to) the repetitive consumption. Although I did feel overwhelmingly moody and lethargic throughout the week and trudged to my dinner table like a kid walking into a dentist appointment, it didn't affect my daily routine, and I was still able to complete everything that I needed to.\n\nAdmittedly, I did have a better variety of ramen to choose from and indulged on healthier fare to make the journey more bearable. Pricier ramen may be made with better ingredients, like wheat flour, which a 2017 study in Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition said may improve nutrient intake. You'd also be surprised at the bounty of ramen options out there; dry and wet, spicy and mild, even some that include meat. Regardless, it's definitely not something I would recommend on a daily basis; doing so long-term is said to incite high blood pressure and a higher chance of getting diabetes and heart disease. A 2017 study in Nutrition Research and Practice found that frequent consumption of instant noodles like ramen is associated with a higher risk of cardiometabolic risk factors, like higher triglyceride levels and higher blood pressure.\n\nI was really thankful for the first clean meal I had at an actual restaurant at the end of my experience \u2014 a salmon avocado roll and some hearty miso cod soup. I think it's safe to say that I'm going to be staying away from the ramen for the time being, but I'm not going to embark on a pantry purge and throw out all my ramen packs. I still harbor an appreciation for the quick fix and found that eating it on a consistent basis is doable due to its versatile nature.\n\nIf you do find yourself simultaneously staring at a desolate refrigerator and bank account, I definitely recommend trying to scrounge together any ingredients you can to throw in anything you can to up the health factor; eating supplementary greens and tofu did wonders for me, and they're relatively cheap to pick up from the store. Besides that, don't be too ashamed of dining on a ramen bowl every so often; just don't be like me and eat it for every. single. meal.", "description": "Ramen is a staple for those looking to save money and time, but it's notoriously high in sodium.
