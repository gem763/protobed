Those attempts were unsuccessful. He credits staff and fellow students with helping him get accepted and crowned Homecoming Royalty this year.\n\n\"Majority of the school population was supporting me,\" he said. \"It's because I'm such a social bird.\"\n\nEmmett Campbell, 16, shot the image of Allen receiving the crown for the school's yearbook. The White Station junior is transgender and said he teared up in the moment.\n\n\"I was standing in front of Brandon and his mom when his name was announced, and I can't begin to explain how intense that moment was for me,\" Campbell said. \"White Station has always been a supportive environment, but to see someone so openly supported in such a public way was incredible.\"\n\nAllen participated in the Memphis Pride parade and festival the next day.\n\nSocial media posts about Allen's crowning have drawn a mixed reaction.\n\nSchool district officials were among the many who voiced their support for Allen and White Station.\n\nIn a tweet, Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray said he supports \"student voice and expression.\"\n\nRegarding @SpartansWSHS Homecoming: Shelby County Schools policy prohibits discrimination, and the District is committed to ensuring a positive and respectful school environment where everyone is treated with dignity. Homecoming queen and king is a tradition... \u2014 Dr. Joris M. Ray (@SCSSuptRay) September 29, 2019\n\nWhite Station High Principal Carrye Holland commented on the school's Facebook post.\n\n\"It's Brandon's right to run for homecoming court under Title IX,\" Holland said. \"It's the students' choice of who they want to support as homecoming royalty.\"\n\nAllen said he has received numerous texts from friends asking if he's OK. He hasn't paid any attention to the comments, he said.\n\n\"As an individual who wants to help others be confident to be themselves, I'm glad that I am the first person to take this step up,\" Allen said.\n\nAlexa Imani Spencer covers suburbs and breaking news for the Commercial Appeal.
