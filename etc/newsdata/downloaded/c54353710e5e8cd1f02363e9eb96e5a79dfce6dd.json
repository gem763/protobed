(Photo: Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nJust days before a North Carolina substitute teacher would be celebrating her 64th birthday, her friend told her she had a feeling it would be a special one. Her pal was absolutely correct, as Phyllis Moss ended up purchasing a Win It All scratch-off ticket worth $1,000,000.\n\n\"A friend of mine told me something wonderful was going to happen on my birthday this year,\" Moss, of Greenville, N.C., said, according to a press release from the NC Education Lottery. \"I never believed it would be this. It's an extra reason to celebrate. Wow! Just wow!\"\n\nAccording to the release, Moss stopped at the Duck Thru Food Store to purchase the $1,000,000 Win It All scratch-off ticket. When she realized she had actually won the $1 million prize, she became so excited she was unable to drive herself home.\n\n\u201cI started crying I was so happy,\u201d Moss said. \u201cI immediately called my fianc\u00e9 and told him, \u2018You need to pick me up. I can\u2019t drive. I can\u2019t drive. I\u2019m shaking so much.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Moss traveled to the lottery headquarters in Raleigh to claim her prize, opting to take the lump sum of $600,000 instead of the $1 million in annuities with 20 payments of $50,000 a year.\n\nAfter federal and state taxes were taken out, Moss went home with $424,503, which she plans to use in part to pay bills and help her family.\n\nThe prize, she added, has changed her life.\n\n\u201cSomeone pinch me,\" Moss said. \"This doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d\n\nSales from games like $1,000,000 Win It All and other lottery tickets help to raise over $700 million a year for education in North Carolina, which is possibly another big win for this substitute teacher.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "\"A friend of mine told me something wonderful was going to happen on my birthday this year,\" the lucky winner shared.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6iH6YCpy7cyjHqzGFcsD2Q--~B/aD0yMjg2O3c9MzIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/178a4c70-7d61-11e9-9bfc-02ff37fdcf55", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
