In fact, Astrobotic\u2019s spacecraft, a lunar lander named Peregrine, will be Vulcan\u2019s very first payload ever, scheduled for launch sometime in 2021. If everything stays on track, the mission could send the first private vehicle to the surface of the Moon.\n\nAstrobotic is one of many companies with its sights set on the lunar surface. The company, based out of Pittsburgh, says its goal is to build vehicles that can ferry instruments and payloads to the Moon for research organizations, space agencies, companies, and more. \u201cOur goal is to make the Moon accessible to the world,\u201d John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic, told The Verge in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s making it possible for every space agency and every corporation and even individuals to send payloads to the lunar surface.\u201d Its inaugural vehicle, Peregrine, stands at around six feet tall and is capable of carrying nearly 200 pounds of cargo to the lunar surface.\n\nNASA recently tasked Astrobotic and two other companies with sending robotic landers to the lunar surface within the next couple of years as part of the agency\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program. The missions are meant to be the first in a series of NASA-sponsored lunar trips, leading up to the eventual return of humans to the Moon. Astrobotic received an award of $79.5 million as part of the deal, and the company hopes to fly up to 14 NASA payloads on the first flight of its Peregrine lander. Astrobotic says it has also signed up 16 other customers for the ride, who will provide additional payloads.\n\nOriginally, Astrobotic had hoped to launch the first Peregrine mission on ULA\u2019s currently operational vehicle, the Atlas V rocket, as early as this year. However, Astrobotic has since pushed back its launch date. The company also noted during its CLPS selection that it was reevaluating launch options for the flight. Astrobotic says it selected Vulcan during a very \u201ccompetitive commercial procurement.\u201d \u201cWhen we launch the first lunar lander from American soil since Apollo, onboard the first Vulcan Centaur rocket, it will be a historic day for the country and commercial enterprise,\u201d Thornton said in a statement.\n\nVulcan is meant to be ULA\u2019s next-generation rocket that will incorporate the design of the Atlas V and provide better performance. And since the Peregrine lander will be the rocket\u2019s very first payload, ULA plans to use this mission as one of two flights needed to certify Vulcan to fly future satellites for the US Air Force. Vulcan\u2019s second flight, scheduled for 2021, will be the first flight of Sierra Nevada Corporation\u2019s cargo spaceplane, called the Dream Chaser.\n\nWith this flight, Astrobotic is also poised to be the first private company to land a vehicle intact on the surface of the Moon. Up until now, only three superpowers \u2014 the US, Russia, and China \u2014 have ever been able to touch down vehicles on the lunar surface. No private companies have been able to match this feat, though one came close. In April, an Israeli nonprofit named SpaceIL attempted to land the first privately funded lander on the Moon, but a glitch caused the vehicle\u2019s engine to shut off prematurely, and the spacecraft slammed into the lunar dirt as a result. So the title of \u201cfirst\u201d private lunar lander is still unclaimed.\n\nMeanwhile, Astrobotic is facing less competition from other companies in the race to the lunar surface. One of the three companies selected for the CLPS program, Orbit Beyond, already said it would not meet its 2020 launch deadline and dropped out of the initial race. The second company, Intuitive Machines, is aiming to launch its payload on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket around the same time as Astrobotic\u2019s mission in 2021. It all depends on which company can stick the closest to its deadline.", "description": "US aerospace startup Astrobotic \u2014 a company that wants to establish a delivery service to the Moon \u2014 says it will fly its very first lunar mission on top of the United Launch Alliance\u2019s future rocket, named Vulcan.
