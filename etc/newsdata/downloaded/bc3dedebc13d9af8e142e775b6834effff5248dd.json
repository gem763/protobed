(AP) - The southern Montana resort community of Big Sky is getting a new $416 million luxury resort soon.\n\nThe Billings Gazette reports that the new Montage Big Sky resort is under construction in the private Spanish Peaks Mountain Club and is projected to open in 2021.\n\nThe resort will include 150 guest rooms, 39 residences, an expansive 16,000-square foot (1,486-square meter) spa and a private 18-hole golf course.\n\nWhen completed, the structure will encompass 520,000 square feet (48,309 square meters). That\u2019s slightly larger than a lodge being built at the nearby Yellowstone Club.\n\nBig Sky Chamber CEO Candace Carr Strauss says the Montage will add to an already existing 1,500 lodging units available nightly in the area.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Billings Gazette, http://www.billingsgazette.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The southern Montana resort community of Big Sky is getting a new $416 million luxury resort soon.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
