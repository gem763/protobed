Climate Protest", "language": "en", "text": "Actress and left-wing activist Jane Fonda accepted the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award For Excellence In Film on Friday and delivered her remarks via a pre-taped video due to her arrest in Washington D.C. over her weekly climate change protests.\n\nThe Grace and Frankie star was not able to attend the award ceremony due to her most recent arrest after protesting climate change in the nation\u2019s capital. Jane Fonda, apparently, foresaw her arrest and provided the awards show producers with a pre-taped acceptance speech, in which she proudly cited her arrests.\n\n\u201cI am receiving the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award For Excellence In Film. I am so honored, I can\u2019t even believe it. I am so grateful. It\u2019s thrilling,\u201d Fonda said in the video. \u201cI am sorry I\u2019m not there, but as you may have heard I have been getting arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided that I needed to do more, and so I\u2019ve moved to DC for four months and trying to heighten the sense of urgency that there needs to be. This is a crisis not just here but all over the world,\u201d the 81-year-old actress stated, referencing global warming.\n\n\u201cThank you BAFTA, and anyway that\u2019s why I\u2019m not with you tonight, but it\u2019s for a good cause and my heart is with you and I\u2019m so grateful,\u201d she added. \u201cThank you very very much.\u201d\n\nFonda was, indeed, arrested on Friday as part of her weekly protests.
