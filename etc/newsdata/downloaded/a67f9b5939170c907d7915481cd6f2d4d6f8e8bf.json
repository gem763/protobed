The move was part of the utility\u2019s first phase of the preventative maneuver. PG&E said as many as 900,000 homes it serves \u2014 serving more than 2 million people \u2014 face a planned outage through Wednesday and into Thursday.\n\nThe utility is making the power cuts to decrease wildfire risks, with strong winds forecast for parts of the state this week.\n\nSonoma County saw 67,000 homes affected, the largest of the initial phase. Firefighters helped residents who were caught by surprise Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had several calls for elderly folks stuck in electric chairs, needing help getting out,\u201d Sonoma Valley Fire Battalion Chief Spencer Andreis said. \u201cIt was very dark. Everything was out. Some of our major intersections weren\u2019t even flashing, which is a big cause for concern.\u201d\n\nPG&E said it would shut off electricity to portions of 34 different counties. The first began began after midnight Tuesday.\n\nThe second phase, expected to impact 235,000 customers, was set for central and northern parts of the state at about noon Wednesday. The third, to affect 42,000 homes in the utility\u2019s southernmost areas, will occur at an undetermined time.\n\nThe size of the blackout map is unprecedented. PG&E said communities not forecast to receive extreme weather may also have their power cut, as the vast electric system relies on power lines that work together.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our most important responsibility, which is why PG&E has decided to turn power off to customers during this widespread, severe wind event,\u201d said Michael Lewis, PG&E\u2019s senior vice president of Electric Operations. \u201cWe understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public\u2019s patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce the risk of wildfire.\u201d\n\nFire officials determined in May that PG&E equipment caused the Camp Fire last November, which became the most destructive wildfire in California history and killed 85 people. It also burned nearly 14,000 homes and razed more than 150,000 acres of land.\n\nSumeet Singh, vice president of PG&E\u2019s Community Wildlife Safety Program, said peak winds are expected to start early Wednesday.\n\nSonoma County\u2019s superintendent told the Los Angeles Times the planned outages are a \u201cblunt\u201d approach, but \u201cthere\u2019s an understanding of why it\u2019s being undertaken.\u201d\n\nWhile the company has received much criticism from the public over its third power shut off in the last two months, Gov. Gavin Newsom defended the company and said the shutoff was in the public interest.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we want to protect people,\u201d he said in Oakland Tuesday at a bill signing event. \u201cWe want to make sure people are safe. This is what PG&E thinks is in the best interest of their customers and ultimately for this region and the state.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 With millions in California facing systemic power outages at some point Wednesday, the state\u2019s largest utility said it has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
