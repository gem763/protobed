After the match the USA head coach, Gary Gold, said that it had to be reviewed if Francis\u2019s shoulder had made contact with Hooley\u2019s head and the England centre will now face a three-man disciplinary panel in Tokyo in the coming days.\n\nHad Berry deemed the incident worthy of a red card at the time, England would have had to play for almost the entire match with 14 men. In the 69th minute of the match, the USA flanker John Quill received the first red card of the tournament for a sickening shoulder to Owen Farrell\u2019s head. Farrell was lucky to escape serious injury with the England attack coach Scott Wisemantel confirming on Friday that he had suffered no delayed after-effects.\n\nFrancis becomes the fourth player cited at the World Cup following World Rugby\u2019s promised clampdown on high tackles and the governing body\u2019s public reprimand for its referees earlier this week. Under World Rugby regulations, any sanctions which involve contact with the head warrant a mid-range entry point and therefore a minimum of six weeks. Australia\u2019s Reece Hodge and Samoa\u2019s Ray Lee-Lo were both handed six-week bans, reduced to three for mitigation. A three-week ban at the World Cup equates to three matches so Francis would not be able to play again until the semi-finals, were England to get that far. England would not be permitted to replace Francis in their squad if he does receive a ban.\n\nHooley played on after the Francis tackle but suffered a concussion in a separate second-half incident involving Mark Wilson and was taken to hospital after the match as a result.\n\nEngland choose attrition rather than razzle-dazzle to deal with USA | Paul Rees Read more\n\nMeanwhile, Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell are both expected to be available for England\u2019s next World Cup match against Argentina on Saturday week after both came through training on Friday. Vunipola and Nowell have missed both of England\u2019s bonus point victories against Tonga and the USA so far, having arrived in Japan with hamstring and knee injuries respectively. Both completed what Eddie Jones had promised would be \u201ca tough session\u201d and as a result are in contention to face Argentina in Tokyo next weekend. With England also hopeful over Henry Slade, Jones is set to have a full complement of 31 players to select from against the Pumas, Francis\u2019s potential ban notwithstanding.\n\n\u201cYou want your best players fit and they trained well this morning,\u201d said Jonny May, who was rested against the USA. \u201cMako is a world class so to have him back is brilliant. Jack is world class as well, so to get two players of that standard, raising the standard of everyone around them, having those options available is brilliant at this stage.\u201d", "description": "The England fly-half faces a potential ban that could rule him out of the rest of the tournament in Japan", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec01b67fc02192f212d851959ec5156f5707ffb/0_129_2674_1603/master/2674.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7268057ab2082515045ee80eb06afe4b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
