The Pentagon has said it planned to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.\n\nThis week, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his adult son's employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM. IBM had previously bid for the contract but had already been eliminated from the competition.\n\nMicrosoft said it was working on a comment. IBM and Oracle did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThe Washington Post on Wednesday reported that retired Navy commander Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speech writer and communications director to former Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, said in a forthcoming book that Trump sought to \u201cscrew\u201d Amazon by awarding the cloud computing contract to a rival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We\u2019re not going to do that,\" Mattis told Pentagon officials, according to The Post's report on the book, which is due to be published on October 29. \"This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\"\n\nReuters could not immediately obtain a copy of the book to verify the Post's report.\n\nIn a statement announcing Microsoft as the winner, the Pentagon underscored its view that the competition was conducted fairly and legally.\n\n\"All (offers) were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation's stated evaluation criteria. Prior to the award, the department conferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the decision to proceed,\" it said.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 2.5 per cent to $US144.35 in after-hours trading after the news. Amazon shares were down 1 per cent to $US1744.12.\n\nThe Pentagon said it had awarded more than $US11 billion across 10 separate cloud contracts over the past two years.\n\n\"As we continue to execute the DOD Cloud Strategy, additional contracts are planned for both cloud services and complementary migration and integration solutions necessary to achieve effective cloud adoption,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nReuters", "description": "The contracting process has long been mired in controversy with President Donald Trump publicly taken swipes at Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3035%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_104%2C$y_349/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9841faa85f847ac61d7df22ec9f41560b05c4552", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
