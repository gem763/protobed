You can keep my severance.\"\n\nShe added: \"Kickstarter's management continues to state that I was fired for performance issues. I find this strange because I not only met but exceeded all performance metrics in Q2. I was great at my job. And I loved it.\"\n\nIn a statement sent to the BBC, Kickstarter said Mr Moore and Ms Redwine were fired for performance reasons, and not because of their union organising. The third employee's role was eliminated from the company.\n\n\"We expect all employees - including organisers - to be able to perform in their role and set up their teams and colleagues for success,\" the company said.\n\n\"Obviously we knew how these terminations could be perceived. But it would be unfair to not hold these people to the same standards as the rest of our staff simply because they are union organisers.\"", "description": "The crowdfunding company has been accused of union-busting by current and former employees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11968/production/_108804027_14a2221d-0f5f-42bc-9cb6-41b49ce4e4a9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
