(Weatherbell.com)\n\nA flood watch is up for a narrow zone in southern New England, where a \u201clong duration heavy rainfall event\u201d is set to unfold through Friday.\n\nWhile rainfall amounts will walk a tight gradient, a bull's eye of three to five inches, with localized eight-inch amounts, is possible in southeastern Massachusetts, Cape Cod, and surrounding islands.\n\nA high wind warning is also up for the Cape and islands, where gusts could approach 55-60 mph and cause some damage.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a hybrid early-season storm system with a hint of tropical nature to it. The instigating area of low pressure has even been monitored by the National Hurricane Center. While it only has a 20 percent chance of development and is \u201cunlikely\u201d to develop any established tropical characteristics, it underscores the connection to the tropics that\u2019s present \u2014 mainly in the plume of deep tropical moisture it\u2019s dragging all the way to New England.\n\n\n\nAn impressive plume of moisture streams north, setting the stage for heavy rain in coastal southern New England. (Weatherbell.com)\n\nIn the image above, notice the streamer of yellow wrapping up into a juicy atmospheric bowling ball off the New England coast. That ball represents locations that have close to two inches of water vapor sitting in the air above them. That means any bands of rain that form will have the potential to be exceptionally heavy, tapping into a reservoir of big-time moisture.\n\nTropical downpours with high rainfall rates can be anticipated where the heaviest bands of rain set up. And with speedy low-level winds scooping more of the air mass north, that moisture bank will constantly be refreshed. The stage could be set for a top-tier rain event in the hardest hit spots.\n\nRain is already falling from Boston and to the south and west, reaching to near New York City. The bulk of the action will remain focused south of the Massachusetts Turnpike on Wednesday, before spreading a hair farther north and west Thursday.\n\nThis system will produce wet weather chances trough the next couple of days.

Winds from the east around 25 to 35 mph, gusting to 55 mph are possible along the Outer Cape and Nantucket as well as Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Elsewhere on the Cape, gusts to 50 mph will be the story. From the Canal through Scituate, and along the tip of Cape Anne, gusts may hit 45 mph.\n\nWinds from the due east are atypical for traditional fall nor\u2019easters. That fact, coupled with fully leafed trees, will raise the potential for at least isolated power outages.\n\nThe wind could also pile up water along the coastline, with minor to moderate coastal flooding possible in Nantucket Harbor. A few instances of coastal flooding are possible in eastern Massachusetts as well, as is beach erosion.\n\nIn addition, for MARINERS, gale to storm force winds are forecast the height of which will be around late Thursday into Thursday night with gusts up around 60 kts (70 mph) possible for the outer waters.\n\n\n\nDangerous boating conditions for all vessels as waves build up to 25 feet. https://t.co/3UeMprAcb7 \u2014 NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) October 9, 2019\n\nWaves just offshore could top 25 feet, combining with 60+ mph winds off the coast, which could pose a significant danger to mariners.\n\nBy Friday, precipitation intensity will be waning some as the system starts to meander north, with perhaps a few downpours sneaking ashore from the New Hampshire Seacoast up through coastal Maine into the weekend.\n\nWhile exact rainfall amounts are uncertain but expected to be high, the placement of the jackpot zone carries more confidence.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a big wide range,\u201d said Joe Dellicarpini, science and operations officer at the National Weather Service in Boston. \u201cOur forecast right now has the heaviest rain over Rhode Island and Southeast Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nSome of the higher resolution models suggest that the heaviest rain may fall in a south to north axis somewhere in Plymouth and/or Bristol counties. Depending on where this sets up, flood-prone locales such as Fall River, New Bedford, or Taunton could wind up with some high-end totals. The National Weather Service\u2019s Boston office wrote that \u201csignificant urban and poor drainage flooding is likely.\"\n\n[11 am] latest radar showing firehose of Atlantic moisture taking aim at #CT #RI and southeast #MA.

If they come together just right, it\u2019s possible to cook up a hybrid sort of system, with both subtropical and mid-latitude traits.\n\n\u201cWith this one, you have the jet dynamics in play, and it\u2019s a large system,\u201d said Dellicarpini. So while its center will remain farther offshore than most big New England snowstorms, for instance, it can \u201cstill bring impacts into [the region],\u201d he said.\n\nSimilar storms have occurred in recent years. More than five inches fell in Hyannis during an event on Oct. 25-26, 2017. Five inches also fell in Worcester in mid-October, 2005. 4.24 inches came down on Oct. 21-22, 2016.\n\n\u201cI remember a setup in October \u201996,\u201d Dellicarpini said. \u201cHurricane Lili was way offshore, but we got a moisture feed in and got some big rainfall.\u201d Boston measured 7.89 inches over just 48 hours associated with that episode.", "description": "Rainfall amounts of three to five inches, with localized eight-inch amounts, are possible.
