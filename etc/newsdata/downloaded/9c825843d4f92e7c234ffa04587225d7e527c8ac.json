In June, Governor JB Pritzker signed the Reproductive Health Act into law, which establishes the fundamental right of a woman to have an abortion.", "description": "Planned Parenthood is set to open an 18,000-square foot 'mega-clinic' in Fairview Heights, Illinois, later this month, just 13 miles away from Missouri's sole abortion clinic in St Louis.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/17/19215920-0-image-a-38_1570034676381.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
