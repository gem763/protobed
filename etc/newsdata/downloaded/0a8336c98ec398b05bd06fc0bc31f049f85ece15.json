The star of the show will almost certainly be the Pixel 4, with its second back camera packed into an iPhone 11-like camera square, face unlock tech that might rival Apple\u2019s Face ID, and a motion-sensing radar that Google\u2019s been quietly developing for years.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just what Google has already told us. The rumor mill suggests there\u2019s way more to the Pixel 4, and we might also see a much faster Google Assistant, a more affordable Pixelbook, new-and-improved Pixel Buds, and additional devices.\n\nThe Verge will be on the ground in New York City during the event, with a live blog and news updates as they happen. But until then, here\u2019s what to expect:\n\nPixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL\n\nFrankly, there\u2019s not much that\u2019s secret about the Pixel 4. It\u2019s perhaps the most-leaked phone ever. But here\u2019s a short summary of what we think Google will show off on Tuesday.\n\nThe new Google flagships are expected to come in two sizes, like usual, have 90Hz variable refresh rate displays, and be outfitted in three colors (\u201cjust black,\u201d \u201cclearly white,\u201d and \u201coh so orange\u201d). The vaunted Pixel camera should get an upgrade with a second camera lens, which is expected to be a 16-megapixel telephoto lens as well as new camera tricks like an astrophotography mode to photograph the stars, a \u201cMotion Mode\u201d to take better action shots, and improvements to portrait mode and Night Sight.\n\nGoogle might spend the most time on Tuesday discussing the sensors hidden in the top bezel of the Pixel \u2014 which, by the way, has no notch. There, you\u2019ll find new face unlock technology that Google claims will be very fast, unlocking your phone without requiring an extra swipe. And in a likely shot at the iPhone\u2019s Face ID, Google says it will work at just about any orientation. Hands-ons with Pixel 4 XLs in the wild seem to back up Google\u2019s claims.\n\nThat top bezel also has Google\u2019s years-in-development radar motion sensing tech called Soli, which will let you wave your hands over the device to do things like skip songs and silence phone calls. This is one thing that hasn\u2019t seemed to work on leaked phones, so Google might be able to surprise us with it on Tuesday.\n\nLeaks also indicate that the Pixel 4 will have an audio recorder that can automatically transcribe recordings, the ability to call emergency services if it detects you\u2019ve been in a car crash, and a new Google Assistant, which we\u2019ll talk about soon.\n\nWe might also see a 5G version of the Pixel 4, as Google has begun \u201ctest production\u201d of a 5G smartphone, according to Nikkei. If it\u2019s only in test production, though, it seems unlikely that it will come out in time for this holiday season. Indeed, Nikkei reports that Google may unveil the 5G model next spring.\n\nIf you want to know much more about the Pixel 4, including photos of it from every angle and perhaps its exact spec sheet, check out our huge post that\u2019s tracking every credible Pixel 4 leak. There have been a lot of them.\n\nNext-generation Google Assistant\n\nGoogle demoed what it called the \u201cnext generation Google Assistant\u201d at its I/O conference in May, and it looked pretty impressive, moving smoothly from task to task:\n\nGoogle says the next-generation Assistant is coming to \u201cnew Pixel phones later this year\u201d (likely the Pixel 4), will run on-device, and can process requests up to 10 times faster than the old Assistant. If it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s hyped to be, we expect Google will spend a solid chunk of time on Assistant on Tuesday to show off more of what it can do. We\u2019re also hoping that Google will discuss if and how the next-generation Assistant may work on its other devices.\n\nThere\u2019s only been one hands-on leak of the new Assistant, which said it was apparently \u201cnoticeably quicker,\u201d but we otherwise don\u2019t have a sense of how good the new Assistant will be in the real world. There have been a lot more leaks of a new Assistant UI, which looks pretty slick, and you can see that in action on a YouTube playlist from XDA Developers:\n\nPixelbook Go\n\nThe original Pixelbook came out in 2017, but since its release, we haven\u2019t been sure of Google\u2019s future ambitions for its laptops. For a while, it even seemed as if there may never be another one \u2014 that is, until Google confirmed to The Verge earlier this year that new laptops were on the way. On Tuesday, we might finally see the first new Pixelbook laptop in two years, according to 9to5Google.\n\nApparently called the Pixelbook Go, it\u2019s expected to have a 13.3-inch 16:9 touchscreen display offered in either Full HD or 4K resolutions. Unlike the 2-in-1 Pixelbook, though, the Pixelbook Go is expected to have a more traditional clamshell laptop form factor.\n\nIf you want a better idea of what the Pixelbook Go might look like, 9to5Google shared a lot of hands-on photos with what it claims is a prototype of the new laptop, revealing a coral-esque color and a ribbed texture on the bottom of the device:\n\nThe Pixelbook Go will also reportedly have two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, also be available in a black color, and come in a variety of configurations, with Intel Core m3, i5, and i7 processors; 8GB or 16GB of RAM; and 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage.\n\nNew Pixel Buds\n\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting for an update to Google\u2019s fiddly Pixel Buds, we might see one at Tuesday\u2019s event, according to 9to5Google. We don\u2019t know much more about them right now, but a suspicious tweet from Android and Chrome chief Hiroshi Lockheimer might hint at what\u2019s to come:\n\nWish list for the perfect pair of truly wireless buds:\n\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Great sound quality, latest codecs\n\n\u2714\ufe0f 10+ hours before needing a charge\n\n\u2714\ufe0f A case that fits in tight pockets, USB-C\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Sweat-proof for workouts\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Intuitive, tactile buttons\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Auto mutes when someone is talking to me \u2014 Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) February 24, 2019\n\nOther things we\u2019re curious about with the new Pixel Buds: the first Buds were connected to each other by a wire, so perhaps Google will eliminate that to make them truly wireless, like Apple\u2019s AirPods. The Verge\u2019s Sean O\u2019Kane had trouble consistently fitting the first Pixel Buds in his ears, so maybe Google will change the design so they sit more snugly. Because it\u2019s Google, we\u2019d expect any new earbuds from the company to have cool Assistant and Translation capabilities.\n\nGoogle Nest Wifi\n\nWe might see a new version of Google\u2019s mesh router system, according to 9to5Google. If the rumors are true, Google might use it as a way to get even more Assistant devices in your home.\n\nApparently renamed \u201cNest Wifi,\u201d the new routers will work like Amazon\u2019s Eero, with a main primary router that can connect to smaller beacons you can place around your house. But interestingly, those smaller Nest Wifi beacons will reportedly double as Google Assistant smart speakers to extend the reach of your voice commands at the same time it\u2019s extending the reach of your Wi-Fi. If the beacons are anything like Eero\u2019s beacons, they might be as easy to install as hanging one right off your wall outlet.\n\nPlus, they may understand requests about your Nest Wifi network, so you could ask them to turn off the internet in the kitchen to keep everyone focused at the dinner table, for example. Also rumored: Nest Wifi may come in three different colors so you can match the routers to best fit your home.\n\nGoogle Nest Mini\n\nSpeaking of mounting a Google Assistant smart speaker to your wall, Google may also have a Google Home Mini successor designed just for that, according to 9to5Google. The new model may also have a new name \u2014 the Nest Mini \u2014 as well as improved sound, a 3.5mm stereo jack, and new colors. It\u2019s also rumored to be able to sense when you\u2019re nearby and show you the volume of what\u2019s currently playing when you\u2019re close to it.", "description": "Google\u2019s annual fall event is finally happening on Tuesday, October 15th, and we expect it\u2019s going to be a big one, with Google likely showing off the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, the next generation Google Assistant, a new Pixelbook, new Pixel Buds, and new Nest devices.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GA-qSQXzImwktj-YOCvFb5stJ6o=/0x66:920x548/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19273153/pixel4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
