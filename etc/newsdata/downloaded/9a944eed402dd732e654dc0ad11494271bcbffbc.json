We hope many of the countries will recognise our independence.\"\n\nManipur, one of India's smallest states with a population of about just 2.8 million people, is one of the so-called \"Seven Sisters\" - a group of restive northeastern states.\n\nThe region, encircled by five other countries and connected to the rest of India by a sliver of land arching over Bangladesh, has been wracked by armed conflict and instability.\n\nViolence part of life\n\nIt has spawned more than 100 fighter groups over the decades whose demands range from autonomy to secession.\n\nViolence has been part of daily life for decades in Manipur, which borders Myanmar, with a strong presence of the Indian military.\n\nThe state has a strong ethnic mix, and its Meitei, Naga, Kuki and Pangal communities are all deeply committed to preserving their own cultural autonomy.\n\nIts people have also always tended to look eastwards in their search for cultural links.\n\nSamarjit said he hoped the world would support its independence cause.\n\n\"We are not free there and our history is going to be destroyed, our culture is going to be extinct,\" he warned.\n\n\"So the UN should listen ... we raise our voice to the whole world that the people living in Manipur are human beings.\"\n\nThe High Commission of India did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Self-declared government based in United Kingdom says it will push for recognition at United Nations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/6/4/f1c411cae3674fa6a53b2ab0b73e10d2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
