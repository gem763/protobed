Beware about accounting gimmick.", "language": "en", "text": "Carefully read below two points:\n\nStock prices fall by 58% but market capitalization goes up by 4.44% over a period of 4 years. Book Value Per Share falls by 59% but the overall Net Worth increases by 2.4% over a period of 4 years.\n\nSounds insane right? And how is that even possible?\n\nSome of you may think that, it is possible when a company announces stock splits or stock bonuses, etc. But to add to your curiosity, there were no stock splits or stock bonuses during the period considered.\n\nThis is the curious case of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and other Public Sector Banks. Below table summarizes PNB\u2019s numbers since 2015.\n\nTable 1\n\nIt can be observed that from 2015 to 2019, Overall book value also known as Net worth has gone up from \u20b940,648 crores to \u20b941,616 crores and Market Cap also went up from \u20b9 26,780 crores to \u20b9 27,970 crores. However, during the same period, BVPS fell from \u20b9 219 in 2015 to \u20b9 90 in 2019.\n\nThis is of course possible only when the number of shares outstanding increases, and in the case of PNB, number of shares outstanding increased from 185.46 crores in 2015 to 460.4 crores in 2019. As mentioned earlier, this increase in the number of shares were not on account of any stock split or stock bonuses but as a result of new equity shares issued to the Government for recapitalization. Central Government's holding in PNB went up from 59.8% in 2015 to 75.41% in 2019.\n\nTo understand how this works, consider a hypothetical scenario of a Bank\u2019s balance sheet having only three items: Share Capital, Advances and Cash.\n\nYear 1:\n\nShare Capital 1000\n\nSources of Funds 1000\n\nAdvances 1000\n\nCash in Hand 0\n\nApplication of Funds 1000\n\nNext year 20% of bank\u2019s advances turn bad and are written off as losses.\n\nYear 2:\n\nShare Capital 800\n\nSources of Funds 800\n\nAdvances 800\n\nCash in Hand 0 Application of Funds 800\n\nNext year existing shareholders bring in more funds so that bank remains in business.\n\nYear 3:\n\nShare Capital 1000\n\nSources of Funds 1000\n\nAdvances 800\n\nCash in Hand 20\n\nApplication of Funds 1000\n\nNext year bank gives out more loans\n\nYear 4:\n\nShare Capital 1000\n\nSources of Funds 1000\n\nAdvances 1000\n\nCash in Hand 0\n\nApplication of Funds 1000\n\nAnd the cycle continues\u2026Coming back to the case of PNB, from the table above it can also be observed that the Gross NPA % has gone up from 6% in 2015 to 15% in 2019, Provisions made per year went up from \u20b9 10,298 crores in 2015 to \u20b9 48,435 crores in 2019 and yet PNB\u2019s Price to book value ratio is at 0.67 in 2019 vs 0.66 in 2015.\n\nThis signifies that though the stock prices declined by 58% in the last 4 years due to deteriorating assets (even recapitalized money went to the same ditch of \u201cNPA\u201d) and minority shareholder\u2019s wealth been massively destroyed, the de-rating of price multiple has not yet happened. Even the \u201cstable book value\u201d (which is the book value factoring all NPA\u2019s turning to loss assets) has declined from \u20b9 136 in 2015 to \u20b9 25 in 2019.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Jamnadas Virji Advisory covering: .
