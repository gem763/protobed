This is a fraud against the American people!\"\n\nBut if a second whistleblower emerges, and if that person has more direct information about the events in question, as The New York Times reported late Friday, the allegations would become more difficult to shrug off.\n\nThe Times said the second official was among those interviewed by inspector general Michael Atkinson about the allegations lodged by the original whistleblower.\n\nThe newspaper, citing two people briefed on the matter, said the second official was still pondering whether to lodge a formal complaint.\n\nCongressional investigators led by House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff have promised a quick and expeditious inquiry, but said Friday that the White House was not cooperating.\n\n\"The White House has refused to engage with -- or even respond to -- multiple requests for documents,\" said a letter signed by the chairmen of the House oversight, intelligence and foreign affairs committees.\n\n\"His actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena.\"\n\nIn their letter to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, the committees demanded that he turn over the requested files by October 18.\n\nThe subpoena followed a demand earlier Friday for documents from Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPompeo -- who recently acknowledged having listened in on a key Trump-Zelensky phone call on July 25 -- failed to meet a Friday subpoena deadline to turn over Ukraine-related documents, CNN reported, citing a House foreign affairs committee aide.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of text messages between US diplomats dealing with Ukraine, made public by the congressional investigators, supported Democratic accusations that Trump had illegally sought foreign help for his reelection effort.\n\nThe text messages showed that some US diplomats had doubts about Trump's pressure on Zelensky, including allegedly freezing a $400 million military aid package.\n\n- Trump responds -\n\nTrump pushed back hard, saying there was no quid pro quo, and in an effort to recast the entire saga, insisting it was his responsibility to investigate \"corruption.\"\n\n\"I don't care about Biden's campaign but I care about corruption,\" he told reporters.\n\nBiden, the former US vice president, responded by calling Trump \"the most corrupt president we've had in modern history.\"\n\nTrump has alleged that Biden's son Hunter earned \"millions\" from sitting on the board of directors of a Ukraine tycoon's gas company.\n\nBut no evidence has surfaced showing wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\n- Romney blasts Trump -", "description": "The Trump administration complained Saturday of harassment by Democratic lawmakers who issued subpoenas for White House documents regarding President Donald Trump's alleged pressuring of Ukraine for political favors.
