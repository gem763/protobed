Republicans have since floated unfounded claims that Biden\u2019s efforts were instead motivated by a desire to help his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a natural gas company Shokin was investigating.\n\nKent reportedly told congressional investigators that Giuliani appealed to the White House after the State Department denied the request but that Shokin\u2019s visa was never ultimately granted.\n\nGiuliani, the White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe State Department told CNN that visa records are confidential under federal law and that the agency does not discuss the particulars of any individual case.\n\nGiuliani has said Shokin told him over Skype that he found evidence of coordination between Democrats and people in Ukraine, as well as unspecified allegations about Biden\u2019s son. He has said Shokin \"believes the current Ambassador Marie L. Yovanovitch denied his visa\" and noted that Yovanovitch was \"close to Mr. Biden.\"\n\nYovanovitch was recalled as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May. She is one of several current and former State Department officials who have provided closed-door testimony to House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nShokin is a key player in the impeachment probe, which was sparked after it was revealed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate claims that Biden lobbied Ukraine for Shokin's dismissal to benefit his son.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, asked the State Department and White House to grant a visa to the former Ukrainian prosecutor who Joe Biden wanted removed when he was vice president, a career diplomat reportedly told\u00a0Congr", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/giulianirudy2_101019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
