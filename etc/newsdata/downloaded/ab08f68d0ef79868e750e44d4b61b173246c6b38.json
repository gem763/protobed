Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nDubnyk is listed as day-to-day after being injured in a collision during the opening minutes of the second period Tuesday against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nEdmonton\u2019s Brandon Manning slid into Dubnyk\u2019s leg, and Minnesota\u2019s Ryan Donato fell to the ice and was also sliding into the goal area. Dubnyk couldn\u2019t avoid Manning, and the contact flipped him to where he landed heavily on his upper back and head. He was replaced by Alex Stalock, who made 16 saves to complete a combined 3-0 shutout. Dubnyk, 33, had nine saves before leaving.\n\nDubnyk, a three-time All-Star, is just 2-5-0 with a 3.92 goals-against average and .880 save percentage in seven games this season.\n\n\u2014Colorado Avalanche right winger Mikko Rantanen is considered week-to-week with a lower-body injury, coach Jared Bednar announced.\n\nRantanen was injured after he toe-picked the ice with his left skate early in the second period of Colorado\u2019s 3-1 loss to the St. Louis Blues on Monday. He did not return.\n\nRantanen, who signed a six-year, $55.5 million contract this summer, is tied with linemate Nathan MacKinnon for the team lead in goals (five) and points (12) this season.\n\n\u2014Ottawa Senators center Colin White is expected to miss three to five weeks with a hip flexor/groin injury, and forward Artem Anisimov is expected to be out one to two weeks with a lower-body injury.\n\nBoth players were placed on injured reserve. General manager Pierre Dorion said White has been playing through the injury, which is believed to have occurred Oct. 19 against Arizona.\n\nIn a corresponding move, the Senators recalled forwards Logan Brown and J.C. Beaudin from Belleville of the AHL.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Minnesota goaltender Devan Dubnyk will miss the Wild's Thursday game against the Nashville Predators with an upper-body injury, the team announced Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444320603&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N025-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
