We are aware that a recruitment advertisement has been circulated on a website that creates a negative juxtaposition to our core values. \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) September 28, 2019\n\nPrager introduced Marlow as a \u201cfighter,\u201d praising Breitbart News as \u201ca very important website\u201d conducting \u201cresponsible, serious reporting.\u201d\n\nMarlow said, \u201cMy readership is being targeted, and it is a readership of over 20 million monthly readers, and that doesn\u2019t include [our] over 30 hours of live broadcast on SiriusXM, as well, and we have so many supporters who are so diverse, and it is one of the great places where you can share ideas and debate, and it\u2019s such a diverse type of people that make Breitbart possible, and now our audience is under attack by none other than the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n\u201cI believe it starts with Breitbart, but we\u2019re just the tip of the spear,\u201d added Marlow. \u201cI think next it will be the Salem audience, and it will be your audience, it will be Town Hall\u2019s audience, and soon, [all] right-of-center viewpoints [are] going to be considered sinful or racist. Period.\u201d\n\nMarlow explained, \u201cSo Breitbart has been subject to an advertising boycott that is part of the cancellation culture that we\u2019re going through now, which is where people spend a lot of time online, obsessively, trying to figure out who is providing a small amount of cash for Breitbart, buying banner ads, and trying to target them and get them to stop advertising with us, to try to cut off our business.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nMarlow described organizers of boycott and censorship campaigns against Breitbart News and the broader conservative landscape.\n\n\u201cIt is a small group of very well-funded people [who are] largely anonymous,\u201d Marlow stated. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who funds them, and they\u2019ve given [themselves] this ethos so that it appears [to be] this vast group, but it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s a handful of AstroTurf far-left activists.\n\n\u201cSomething changed a little bit last week, where a Daily Beast editor \u2014 the editor of the Daily Beast \u2014 a guy named Noah Shachtman, suggested to the Los Angeles Police Department that they should not be running recruitment ads on Breitbart. Instead of the LAPD doing nothing or suggesting Breitbart\u2019s got over 20 million readers and is an overwhelmingly pro-law enforcement website, the Los Angeles Police Department sent out the following tweet, this is one of several, \u2018The LAPD celebrates diversity and embraces it within our ranks, and within the city we serve. We are aware that a recruitment advertisement has been circulated on a website that creates a negative juxtaposition to our core values,\u2019 and it goes on from there, but it suggested that Breitbart does not represent the LA police department\u2019s core values, and [now] they\u2019re investigating how to remove advertising from Breitbart.\u201d\n\nMarlow noted, \u201cSo this isn\u2019t just a private business run by individuals, this is a government entity \u2014 a law enforcement entity \u2014 that is not just trying to ban and boycott a website, but trying to do so [to a news media outlet] that is an overwhelmingly pro-law enforcement and pro-police website.\u201d\n\nPrager replied, \u201cI have no words. A police department would boycott a website of vast supporters of the police. This is just another example of what\u2019s going on, and what they accuse you of has no truth\u2026 The left has even poisoned police departments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey started to try to cut off our financial resources by having blacklists and trying to get our advertisers to leave us,\u201d Marlow said of the so-called \u201cgrassroots\u201d business shamers who have targeted Breitbart. \u201cBut this is an activist group who was doing this and leading the charge on it, a handful of people funded by the institutional left.\u201d\n\nMarlow went on, \u201c[The LAPD] won\u2019t tell us what these core values are\u2026 We\u2019ve been trying to beg them to get an example, and then they say that we\u2019re alt-right, and then we point out to them that our ownership is Jewish, the company is overwhelmingly pro-Israel\u2026 our chief copy editor is a black woman, our entertainment editor is a black man, Jerome Hudson, who had a great interview with you last week\u2026 our world editor is a Hispanic woman, you\u2019ve had Joel Pollak on your show, an orthodox Jew.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that a lot of the rank and file of the LAPD \u2014 that are that thin blue line that keeps us safe \u2014 they\u2019re not into this,\u201d Marlow remarked. \u201cThis is the leadership, and it\u2019s a leadership that I don\u2019t think takes the real problems facing their city seriously\u2026 So now they won\u2019t recruit conservatives. So what happens next? Where does the slippery slope go? If conservatives are unwelcome at the LAPD, they should just flat-out say it to us.\u201d\n\nAsked by Prager what LAPD officers and employees should do, Marlow determined, \u201cI would say that they should probably speak up. I don\u2019t think we can be silent any longer. This is the thing, a lot of conservatives are very passive.\u201d\n\nPrager regularly describes courage as one of the rarest \u2014 and most valuable \u2014 character traits.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "description": "Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, joined Dennis Prager on Wednesday's edition of the latter's eponymous radio program to...", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19192088972538-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
