Due to the poor course conditions, there are no spectators allowed for today\u2019s round.\n\nWoods started his first round Wednesday night with three straight bogeys, then made nine birdies over his final 14 holes to walk off the course in the lead with a 6 under 64. Gary Woodland would later tie Woods for first.\n\nWoods tees off on the first hole Friday night at 10:40 p.m. ET alongside Satoshi Kodaira and Tommy Fleetwood.\n\nFollow Woods\u2019 second round with shot-by-shot analysis from Japan.\n\nZozo Championship: Leaderboard | Best photos\n\nHole 14 \u2013 Par 5\n\nAfter a three-group backup on the 14th, Tiger finally got to play! Driver goes down the right side of the fairway. Lovely. 3-wood comes up just short of the green, leaving a nice, easy pitch to the back pin. Except he got a little too frisky with this one and it takes a hop off the green to the fringe. From there Tiger gets in in two and saves par. Moving on.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 4 under thru 14 (10 under overall).\n\nHole 13 \u2013 Par 3\n\nWith fans not being allowed to enter, they\u2019re literally looking over a fence from outside the grounds on the 13th. Tiger gave \u2019em something to cheer for. He sticks his tee shot inside 10 feet and will have a solid look to once again take a share of the lead. Tiger took his time with this one and it paid off as he drills the putt and takes his spot back on top of the leaderboard with Gary Woodland.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 4 under thru 13 (10 under overall).\n\nHole 12 \u2013 Par 4\n\nDriver. Doesn\u2019t like it. Right. Rough. Shouldn\u2019t be too difficult from there. Must\u2019ve been a thick lie because this one comes up short. TW stays hot around the greens and hits a beautiful chip to a foot or two. Lovely par save. Short game = on point.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 3 under thru 12 (9 under overall).\n\nHole 11 \u2013 Par 4\n\nDriver. Fairway. Boom.\n\nApproach. Beauty. Nice. He\u2019s right around 10-15 feet with an uphill putt awaiting. Definitely makeable. After struggling a bit with his irons early he\u2019s slowly getting his touch back today. (Golf) Ball Don\u2019t Lie! After a tricky putt on 10 refused to fall, this one on No. 11 catches the edge and drops for birdie. One shot back. Cruising.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 3 under thru 11 (9 under overall).\n\nHole 10 \u2013 Par 4\n\nThis is an interesting hole. The immense rain flooded the hole, so it\u2019s still playing as a par 4 \u2026 BUT AT 140 YARDS! Eagle chances out the wazoo today on No. 10. Tiger\u2019s turn.\n\nYUP. Tiger sticks this one inside ten feet and that\u2019s a fantastic look at eagle, at worst birdie. Showtime. Umm \u2026 what? How did this not fall?! Tiger\u2019s putt was in, then out, then in, then out by a centimeter. The ball changed directions three times inside two feet. Wild. But hey, it\u2019s a birdie!\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 2 under thru 10 (8 under overall).\n\nHole 9 \u2013 Par 4\n\nWell, it\u2019s a bad drive but he got a lucky bounce into the fairway. No pictures in the scorecard, that\u2019s a fairway hit. His approach just climbs up on the green, well below the pin, but hey, it\u2019s a birdie putt (shrugs). He gives this one a good roll but he just comes up a few inches off. Tap-in par, making the turn at 1-under 33.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under thru 9 (7 under overall).\n\nHole 8 \u2013 Par 4\n\nAnother driver, another missed fairway. He\u2019s in the rough, but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as on No. 6. Probably still playing for par here. From 114 yards out, Tiger throws this one high in the air, but it comes up just a few yards too short. He\u2019s on the beach in the bunker guarding the front of the green. Going to need a clever up-and-down from there. Can this guy scramble or what? Sticks the approach to just a couple feet and cleans up for par. How about that?\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under thru 8 (7 under overall).\n\nHole 7 \u2013 Par 3\n\nIn the first round Tiger was absolutely dialed in with his irons and he played the par 3\u2019s rather well. This one finds the green, about 20-30 feet below the cup. He buried a long putt in the first round, let\u2019s see if he can do it again. YOU BET HE CAN! Back to red figures on the day after canning the left-to-right sweeper from distance. Fantastic effort there.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under thru 7 (7 under overall).\n\nHole 6 \u2013 Par 5\n\nWell, this one was struck solid with driver \u2026 just left. It carried through the fairway and took a big hop deep into the rough and among a cluster of trees. Any window he has to seriously advance up the fairway will be tight. This could be trouble. Oh yeah, he\u2019s right behind a tree. Small window, if you can even call it that. He punches this one out, takes his medicine and finds the rough.\n\nTiger\u2019s approach misses the green (not surprising given the lie) but his chip gets to right around 5 feet. USEFUL effort. He walks in the par putt and once again avoids a dropped shot. He\u2019s gonna have to clean it up because Gary Woodland just took the lead at 9 under.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: Even thru 6 (6 under overall).\n\nHole 5 \u2013 Par 3\n\nThis one was left all the way off the tee. He finds the rough and has a testy little chip from there. TW\u2019s short game has been pretty solid this week, and this hole is no different. He gets to about 5 feet and buries the putt for par to avoid any further damage.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: Even thru 5 (6 under overall).\n\nHole 4 \u2013 Par 4\n\nBIG drive here for TW. He\u2019s long down the fairway. Solid stroke. His approach just finds the green, setting up a lengthy look at birdie. His putt had a good run, but misses wide. Another two-putt par. Moving on.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: Even thru 4 (6 under overall).\n\nHole 3 \u2013 Par 3\n\nTW tees this one up on the left side of the tee box and a smooth swing finds the middle of the green, but he certainly didn\u2019t love it. His putt had some good pace, just the wrong line to match it. Par.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: Even thru 3 (6 under overall).\n\nHole 2 \u2013 Par 4\n\nTiger off the tee here on No. 2 and it\u2019s in the short stuff. He\u2019s gnawing on that gum and looks in control early. Well this approach was \u2026 not good. He left this one in the thick rough, and that\u2019ll be a tough up-and-down for par. Difficult? For Tiger? He just stuck this one inside six feet, should be a par. Nope. Caught the edge. Bogey, gives back the opening birdie.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: Even thru 2 (6 under overall).\n\nHole 1 \u2013 Par 4\n\nShowtime. Fairway metal for TW off No. 1 and he paints the fairway. No gallery today as spectators aren\u2019t allowed, which is weird to see with Tiger. Hideki Matsuyama\u2019s off to a 3 under through 5 hole-start and has the lead at 8 under. Tiger enters at 6 under. Woo boy! He sticks this one nice and close to the pin, that should be a birdie on one. And it is. Solid start for TW.\n\nTIGER ON THE DAY: 1 under thru 1 (7 under overall).\n\nOne hole played.\n\nOne circle on the card. Birdie on 1 for @TigerWoods.#QuickHits pic.twitter.com/HwhTn44dhZ \u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) October 26, 2019\n\nWarm-ups\n\nHere\u2019s a fun fact to get y\u2019all in the mood: Tiger has converted on 15-30 18-hole leads in his career. So \u2026 chances are high he\u2019s in contention come Sunday night/Monday morning, wherever you\u2019re following from. A win would give The Big Cat some serious thinking to do about his four captain picks for the Presidents Cup later this year in Australia.", "description": "Follow along for shot-by-shot analysis of Tiger Woods' second round at the Zozo Championship in Japan.", "authors": ["Adam Woodard", "Steve Dimeglio", "Todd Kelly Golfweek", "Associated Press", "Jason Lusk", "Alistair Tait", "Juliakate E.
