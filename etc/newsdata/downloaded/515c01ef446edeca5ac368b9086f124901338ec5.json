The new instances of family separation came to light after a judge ordered the Administration to deliver an accounting of every case.\n\nAbout 200 of the 1,556 cases involved children under 5 years old, says the ACLU, which is leading a class-action lawsuit against the Administration. \u201cWe \u2014 naively, looking back \u2014 assumed the government was telling us about all the children they had separated,\u201d Lee Gelernt, the lead ACLU attorney in the lawsuit, tells TIME. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve learned is that we need to continuously press the government to find out what they may not be disclosing.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s class-action lawsuit has now expanded to include the 1,556 families along with the original 2,800 who were separated during former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 Zero-Tolerance Policy. \u201cAt every stage of this case there have been shocking revelations,\u201d Gelernt says. \u201cIn some ways, the real work is going to begin [now] because we have to try to find all these 1,500 families.\u201d\n\nThe newly-disclosed cases deal with the period of July 1, 2017 through June 26, 2018, according to the ACLU \u2014 meaning many families were separated months before Sessions\u2019 Zero-Tolerance Policy began on April 6, 2018. \u201cThere was a lot of public outcry over children who were separated during the Zero-Tolerance Policy, but this group of kids never really got that kind of public attention,\u201d says Christie Turner, Deputy Director for Special Programs at Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), which is assisting in locating the families and providing them with legal services.\n\n\u201cThis was happening and a lot of us [lawyers and advocates] had a sense that it was happening, because we were hearing about individual cases where [separation] was occurring,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand the scale. I don\u2019t think anyone really did know, outside of the government, that it was such a huge number.\u201d\n\nThe children were released to sponsors \u2014 caretakers, often other relatives, who agree to take on responsibility \u2014 before a judge ordered an injunction barring the practice on June 26, 2018.\n\nNow lawyers are taking on the challenge of locating the families using contact info provided by the government, though in many cases the affected parents may have already been deported (with or without their children). Lawyers say the contact information is old, making communication difficult.\n\n\u201cIf a kid was released way back in 2017, at this point that contact information is stale,\u201d Turner tells TIME. \u201cEven if we do find people, the question of what they need and how that\u2019s going to be addressed is still open.\u201d\n\nThose needs might be great, she adds, including legal advice, mental health services and possible reunification.\n\nAn additional 1,090 families have been separated since the administration declared an end to family separations in June 2018. Gelernt and and other immigration attorneys on the southern border with Mexico tell TIME that in most of these cases, a child is taken away because of a minor offense by the parent, including past traffic violations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) maintains that it can separate a parent and child if the parent is referred for criminal prosecution.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment, and has not issued a public statement since their disclosure Thursday.\n\nThe new accounts come days after former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen \u2014 who had signed off on the separations \u2014 was asked if she regretted her involvement with the separations at Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women Summit on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t regret enforcing the law,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I regret is that that information flow and coordination to quickly reunite the families was clearly not in place and that\u2019s why the practice was stopped through an executive order.\u201d", "description": "A Trump Administration lawsuit revealed an additional 1,556 children were separated from their parents then what was previously reported.", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XhkuIXi9U3uLLO5g3HAR4Q--~B/aD0yODkyO3c9NDM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/a60fbea18643548858a094759d5df06c", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
