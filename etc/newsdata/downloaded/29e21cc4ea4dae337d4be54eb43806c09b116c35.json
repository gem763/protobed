One of the things Trump said, by the way, is that Adam Schiff should have should be charged with treason. Now, you think, \u201cWell, wuh, wuh?\u201d\n\nWell, Schiff is out there as the chairman of a committee, the Intelligence Committee, openly lying about the president\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine \u2014 and he lied about it again today in his joint press conference with Pelosi. He literally said that the president told the Ukrainian president to \u201ccreate dirt,\u201d to \u201cmake it up, as much as you can.\u201d When the Republicans finally called him on it, Schiff said, \u201cWell, I was just engaging parody. I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t seen.\u201d\n\nWell, look, you have the sense of humor of a snail. Nobody thinks anything about you is funny, Pencil Neck. It wasn\u2019t parody, anyway \u2014 and if you have to tell somebody that you\u2019ve just done parody, it was very bad parody. It was not parody. It was an attempt to purposely misstate and mischaracterize the words and the actions of the president of the United States. They\u2019re trying to create the illusion that Trump is a mob boss and he was ordering somebody, \u201cMake up dirt or else we\u2019re not gonna give you the money \u2014 or worse.\u201d\n\nNone of what they are saying happened in that phone call did, and we\u2019ve even got Never Trumpers now all over Fox News, \u201cWell, this phone call is very hard to defend. I wouldn\u2019t want to have to defend this phone call. If I were the Republicans, I wouldn\u2019t want\u2026\u201d There\u2019s nothing hard to defend about the phone call! You just don\u2019t want to defend it! You know, Fox really ought to change the name of the network from the Fox News Channel to the Fox Never Trumper Network, because that\u2019s who\u2019s getting the highlights, and they\u2019re bringing in Democrats like Donna Brazile.\n\nWhat do you mean, \u201cThe phone call\u2019s hard to defend\u201d? The phone call\u2019s not hard to defend, and Trump isn\u2019t hard to defend! But if Trump is hard to defend, what about conservatism, you Never Trumpers? Can you defend that? Do you not understand that conservatism\u2019s under assault? You may not be because you\u2019re renouncing conservatism to sidle up with these guys that you don\u2019t want to be criticized by. So you\u2019d rather be friends with these nincompoops on the left than have to defend your own side and defend your own beliefs!", "description": "Wednesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh took a jab at Fox News for the airtime the cable news network was allotting for critics of President Donald Trump. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Limbaugh82-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
