It was difficult to explain to them, because the local perception is that entrepreneurs are tycoons and connected to the mafia \u2013 not something you would want your daughter to be.\u201d\n\nCroatia joined the EU in 2013. Its ascension boosted the county\u2019s exports from below 40 per cent of GDP in 2008 to above 50 per cent in 2018, according to the World Bank. But tech entrepreneurs from the country have faced challenges including lack of public funding and education to support the sector.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, [entrepreneurship] sounds more logical as a career path [in Croatia] but, a couple of years ago, with two women, no family support financially, it was quite unusual,\u201d she says.\n\nTacit was founded by Majic out of the ashes of another biometrics research company called ID Guardian. It has since expanded to a team of five working with other specialists in Boston in the US and Singapore to provide insight for businesses based on analysing a respondent\u2019s emotions, from their heart rate to their eye movements, to tell how they truly feel rather than what they are trying to portray.\n\nSo far, Tacit has been used by the gaming industry to create a performance algorithm for players of video games, allowing them to get granular insights on their game, and in-product development, when analysts might be trying to judge whether a customer prefers one version of a recipe over another.\n\n\u201cPeople have a hard time articulating how they feel about taste and smell,\u201d Majic says. \u201cWe can map out, millisecond by millisecond, how someone is feeling by using their biometric data.\u201d\n\nTacit captures data across 11 data points, using two different products. Tacit Light gathers data remotely, using the camera on a smartphone or a web-camera. Tacit Pro includes hardware that has to be worn by the respondent.\n\nMajic says the company uses the light versions of the software to make hypotheses that can be proved using the professional product, which offers more conclusive data. The data collected includes facial coding, speech analysis, eye tracking, skin temperature, heart rate and the amount of oxygen in the blood.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 of the best celebrity FaceApp Challenge photos Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

In one, a user\u2019s biometrics are tracked while they search for teeth-whitening products, showing they are excited when they start to research the topic, disgusted when they discover a home-made whitening video, satisfied during scrolling and the moment that they decide to buy a product. In another, the emotional response of someone is tracked while they are looking for baby food, showing dissatisfaction with high prices and disappointment with ingredients.\n\nPerhaps even more exciting is the potential for using biometric data to track emotional responses during job interviews and shareholder calls. Another video shows Tacit software analysing the tone and pitch of Elon Musk\u2019s voice as he answers questions on a call about the company\u2019s financial results. The video suggests at what points Musk\u2019s speech indicates stress, particularly around details about the Tesla Model 3.\n\nThe local perception is that entrepreneurs are tycoons and connected to the mafia \u2013 not something you would want your daughter to be\n\n\u201cYou can give the perfect answer but, if you put it through a speech sentiment analysis, it might not be in sync with what the person is saying,\u201d Majic says. \u201cThere are moments when it gets interesting on earnings calls and recruitment where someone could say they are really good at something, but the results show something different.\u201d\n\nTacit has developed the algorithms by extracting metadata from white papers and then testing it in labs. It is currently working with researchers at the University of Zagreb on a project quantifying the levels of empathy in convicted criminals. \u201cOne of the things they are doing is showing virtual reality content of emotionally charged scenes to provoke a negative reaction, and seeing to what degree the criminals react,\u201d Majic says.\n\nIs there any assignment that Tacit would refuse on ethical grounds? \u201cWe would say no to anything that is a \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 moment,\u201d Majic says. \u201cFor example, when the person doesn\u2019t know data is being collected. We don\u2019t want to be in the position where someone down the line uses that dataset for something it was not intended for. Anything that sounds too vague, or requires sharing raw data, is unacceptable to us.\u201d\n\nUnder EU law, citizens are protected from having their biometric information linked with their identity and shared with third parties without their consent. Under GDPR, companies collecting biometric data also have to boost the security around that data or face fines of up to \u20ac20m. Nonetheless, anything that can be measured remotely, such as speech analysis and facial coding, can be captured without consent, Majic says.\n\n\u201cThe EU is good at raising the level of awareness on data protection,\u201d Majic says. \u201cBut Asian companies are prolific on the scale they deploy facial recognition, facial coding and everything that can be captured remotely. We\u2019re all aware that whoever has the biggest data set is winning \u2013 and the EU will not be winning.\u201d\n\nTacit has not received any investment, preferring to stay private and sell its services rather than seeking outside funding. Majic says this decision was influenced in part by her early experience in trying to build a biometric teddy bear that acted like a Fitbit for kids. That project attracted a small amount of funding, she says, but nowhere near the amount needed to produce and export the hardware.\n\nMajic says she was \u201csoul-crushed\u201d when they had to fold that business. \u201cI was 23 at the time, so I lacked some hands-on experience, but we realised that we have built a lot of expertise in sensors and we could do stuff that was more realistic, analysing biometric data rather than manufacturing hardware.\u201d\n\nMajic\u2019s pragmatism comes from her experience of growing up in a country where her options were limited. \u201cThe rationale was quite simple,\u201d she says of her decision to become an entrepreneur when she graduated in 2013, at a time when the Croatian economy was still suffering from the after-effects of the financial crisis. \u201cMe and my co-founder realised that there would be no dream job, so we decided to build something on our own.\u201d\n\nAnd have her parents finally come around to the idea? \u201cThe perception [of entrepreneurs] is slightly changing now, because of a few [from Croatia] who are amazing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut to this day, we still have interesting debates about whether it\u2019s worth it, because for them it was never an option.\u201d", "description": "Josipa Majic, the Croatian entrepreneur behind\u00a0biometrics startup Tacit, has not always found it easy to explain her career choice to her family.", "authors": ["Hazel Sheffield"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/17/josipa-majic-tacit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
