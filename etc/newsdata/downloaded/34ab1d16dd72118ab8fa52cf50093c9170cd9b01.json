The movement opens a new front in the fight against climate change that could affect everything from heating systems in skyscrapers to stoves in suburban homes.\n\nBerkeley, California, in July became the first U.S. city to pass an ordinance banning gas systems in new buildings, and it may soon be followed by many others, according to interviews with local officials, activists and industry groups. Los Angeles and Seattle are among those considering laws that could drastically reduce natural gas consumption.\n\n\u201cBerkeley is the opening salvo,\u201d said Bruce Nilles, managing director of think tank Rocky Mountain Institute\u2019s building electrification program.\n\nLocal officials and environmentalists cite mounting evidence that unburned gas leaking from pipes and compressor stations harms the climate more than carbon dioxide, the byproduct of burned fossil fuels.\n\nMany environmentalists until recently considered natural gas a \u201cbridge fuel\u201d to a future of renewable energy because gas burns cleaner than oil or coal. Now local officials are stepping into what they call a federal regulatory void under the administration of President Donald Trump, who argues fossil-fuel restrictions needlessly damage the economy.\n\nThey want buildings switched to electric power from a grid that is increasingly powered by renewable energy. U.S. utilities currently derive about 35% of their electricity from gas but have also nearly doubled their use of renewable fuels in the past decade, from 9% to 17% of all power, according to the EIA.\n\nResidential and commercial buildings account for about 12% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. They are also crucial to natural gas sales: Direct gas consumption amounted to about 8.45 trillion cubic feet in 2018, rivaling the 10.63 tcf used by utilities to power the grid, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nIf gas bans in buildings become widespread, they could upend the business models of some of the world's biggest energy companies, which are investing billions of dollars to produce and ship more natural gas on the belief the fuel will play a key role in the transition to a cleaner energy economy. Big gas producers including Exxon Mobil here (XOM.N), Shell here (RDSa.L), and BP here (BP.N), argue gas improves the environment by replacing dirtier fuels such as coal.\n\nNatural gas companies alarmed by the trend are pushing back with ad campaigns and research promoting gas as a superior cooking fuel and an affordable option in a country that has become the world\u2019s top gas producer.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get ahead of it,\u201d said Stuart Saulters, the Director of Government Affairs of the American Public Gas Association. \u201cWe think there is a chance this can domino.\u201d\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, which represents the U.S. oil-and-gas industry, rejects claims that natural gas is bad for the environment, arguing its increased use has helped cut U.S. carbon emissions. Spokesman Reid Porter said that the industry is also limiting methane emissions with improved leak-prevention technology, citing data here from the Environmental Protection Agency showing a decline in recent years.\n\nLOS ANGELES, SEATTLE, MINNEAPOLIS RETHINK NATURAL GAS\n\nNilles, of the Rocky Mountain Institute, said some 50 California municipalities are studying new limits on natural gas in buildings, including Silicon Valley-area cities such as Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and San Jose, the nation\u2019s 10th most populous city. Los Angeles set a goal in April of powering all its buildings with renewable energy by 2050, starting with new buildings by 2030.\n\nSan Luis Obispo last week became the second city, after Berkeley, to pass a law limiting gas installations in new buildings. Kate Harrison, the Berkeley council member who spearheaded the city\u2019s gas ban, said she has been contacted by dozens of cities studying similar measures in states including Massachusetts and Minnesota.\n\nOfficials in the Boston suburb of Brookline, for instance, will vote in November on a measure to ban gas hookups in new buildings. In Minnesota, three-quarters of the state\u2019s residential heating - largely fueled by gas - would have to convert to electricity to meet the state\u2019s goal of an 80% carbon emissions reduction by 2050, according to a report by the McKnight Foundation, a philanthropic organization.\n\nNew York City in April also passed a bill requiring buildings of more than 25,000 square feet to cut greenhouse emissions 40% by 2030 - a standard expected to reduce natural gas use.\n\nSeattle City Council Member Mike O\u2019Brien is working on legislation to ban gas hookups in new buildings. The fuel, he said, \u201cis odorless and invisible but has a huge impact on the climate.\u201d\n\nHOT SHOWERS AND CRACKLING FIRES\n\nThe American Public Gas Association\u2019s ad campaign is aimed at 25- to 44-year-old homeowners with incomes of more than $75,000, according to a slide presentation about it seen by Reuters. It features Facebook and Instagram ads showing people enjoying hot showers, cooking on gas stoves and relaxing by a firepit. Campaign director Saulters said it was one of the group\u2019s most expensive promotional efforts to date, without disclosing its cost.\n\nIn July, a group called Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions - formed by Sempra Energy (SRE.N) unit SoCal Gas - held a press conference with Southern California restaurant owners who favor gas stoves.\n\n\u201cWe need instant, really strong fire,\u201d said Charles Lu, the owner of a Chinese restaurant chain who participated in the event. \u201cOtherwise, I think it will kill the business.\u201d\n\nWealthier homeowners may also resist electrification of kitchens and fireplaces, according to Nic Dunfee of environmental consulting firm TRC Companies Inc, who oversees an incentive program to rebuild homes in wildfire-stricken Sonoma County. Builders are pushing back on proposed mandates for electric stoves, he said at a recent meeting of California energy regulators.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A natural gas flare on an oil well pad burns as the sun sets outside Watford City, North Dakota January 21, 2016.
