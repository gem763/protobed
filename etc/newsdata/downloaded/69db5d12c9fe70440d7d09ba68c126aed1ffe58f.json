We must reform our criminal justice system, which is designed to criminalize people of colour.\u201d\n\nMr Somerville, who has already served the jail time, was supposed to be on a jury for a negligence case linked to a car accident at the end of August but slept in around two hours longer than he was supposed to.\n\nThe young man, who lives with his grandparents and had no previous criminal record, said he did not get in touch with the court due to feeling anxious.\n\n\u201cI woke up and I was like, \u2018Oh shoot, it\u2019s past the time\u2019,\u201d he told WPTV.\n\nHe added: \u201cAfter going through that, my life will never be the same again.\u201d\n\nMr Somerville, who would have been serving on the jury for the first time, said he could only think about his grandfather throughout the ordeal.\n\n\"He depends on me, so it\u2019s hard for him,\" he said.\n\nJudge John Kastrenakes\u2019 order said Mr Somerville\u2019s no-show at the court postponed the trial by 45 minutes.\n\nOn Friday, the judge cut the probation to three months and his community service from 150 to 30 hours after the public defender\u2019s office appealed the misdemeanour conviction.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
