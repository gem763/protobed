He said it would be \"extremely difficult\" to hit the government's pre-protest forecast of growth of between 0% and 1% for 2019.\n\n\"The blow to our economy [from the protests] is comprehensive,\" Mr Chan said.\n\nThe demonstrations began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Five months of protests in Hong Kong have hit the territory's economy\n\nHong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland.\n\nClashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and protesters storming parliament.\n\nThose protests have led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals, with visitor numbers expected to have slumped 50% in October.\n\nHong Kong was one of the world's most visited cities last year, with 30 million tourists.\n\nRetailers have also been hard hit. Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours, while workers report fears over their safety as well as getting to work.\n\nMr Chan said in August that retail sales had plunged more than 25% - the biggest monthly drop on record.", "description": "Ms Lam says the economy is likely to have contracted as long-running protests continue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/95B4/production/_109442383_carrielamsmall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
