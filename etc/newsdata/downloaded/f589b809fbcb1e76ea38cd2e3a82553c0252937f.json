(Mary F. Calvert/Reuters)\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday opened what is likely to be an unusually consequential term with a pair of criminal justice cases and only eight justices on the bench.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86, was in her usual spot at the chief justice\u2019s left, despite dealing this summer with radiation treatment for a tumor on her pancreas. Ginsburg looked fit in her black robe and distinctive white jabot, and, as usual, was an early and aggressive questioner.\n\n[Ginsburg says she is on the way to being \u2018very well\u2019]\n\nThe spot to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\u2019s right was vacant. He said Justice Clarence Thomas, 71, was \u201cindisposed due to illness,\u201d but will participate in the cases the court considered by reading transcripts and listening to recordings of the arguments. A court spokeswoman said Thomas appeared to have the flu.\n\nThe court considered a case from Louisiana about whether a jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous and another about whether Kansas and other states must allow an insanity defense for criminal defendants.\n\nOutside the court, a line grew of people trying to secure a spot in the courtroom for Tuesday\u2019s cases: whether federal law forbidding discrimination against workers \u201cbecause of sex\u201d covers sexual orientation and transgender status. People began camping out Friday night.\n\n[Supreme Court faces one of most politically volatile terms in years]\n\nThe justices experimented Monday with allowing the advocates making arguments two minutes of uninterrupted time before jumping in to ask them questions. Both the lawyers and the justices seemed a little uneasy with the arrangement.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan appeared to be advising Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. where to look for the blinking white light on the lectern that signaled when those two minutes expired.\n\nOne advocate did not use all of her time and told the justices to start interrogating.\n\nThey seemed inclined to rule that jury verdicts must be unanimous. Only two states, Louisiana and Oregon, allow convictions on variations such as 10-2 or 11-1. And Louisiana voters approved a referendum requiring unanimous votes after Jan. 1, 2019.\n\nBut that does nothing for Evangelisto Ramos, who was convicted of murder in 2016 on a 10-2 vote. He argues that the constitutional right to trial includes the right to a unanimous verdict.\n\nA curious 1972 Supreme Court precedent stands in his way. In that case, the court ruled 5 to 4 that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous verdicts in federal trials. But one of the five, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., said unanimous verdicts were not required in state trials.\n\nRamos\u2019s lawyer, Stanford law professor Jeffrey L. Fisher, said that decision was an outlier and that the court in other contexts has endorsed the idea of unanimity in jury verdicts.\n\n\u201cWhen the court says something is a fundamental rule under our way of doing criminal justice, the states have to follow that rule the same way as the federal government,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nBut Louisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill said \u201cnothing in the text, structure, or history of the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts.\u201d She said the state had relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s expressed approval of non-unanimous verdicts for more than 50 years, and 32,000 people are in prison under that system.\n\nUnder questioning, Murrill acknowledged she did not know how many had been convicted by less than unanimous juries and could mount a challenge such as Ramos\u2019s.\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch said it was not just the state that had an interest, however.\n\n\u201cYou say we should worry about the 32,000 people imprisoned,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cOne might wonder whether we should worry about their interests under the Sixth Amendment as well.\u201d\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh alluded to history that indicates Louisiana and Oregon both adopted the less-than-unanimous verdict rule to diminish the impact of minority jurors who might hold out for innocence.\n\nThose two \u201cpractical arguments\u201d \u2014 that some were convicted when others were freed because the jury was not unanimous, and because the rules had racist roots \u2014 might be enough to overturn the court\u2019s precedent, Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe case is Ramos v. Louisiana.\n\nThe Kansas case involved whether a state may do away with the insanity defense, which bars holding someone criminally responsible when mental illness prevents them knowing right from wrong.\n\nJames Kraig Kahler killed four family members, including his estranged wife and two teenage daughters, in 2009. He was convicted and sentenced to death.\n\nHis lawyers said severe depression over the breakup of his marriage rendered him incapable of forming the intent to convict him of capital murder.\n\nBut Kansas, where the murders occurred, is one of only a few states that have gotten rid of insanity as a defense to avoid conviction. (It also points out Kahler was aware enough to spare his son, who he thought had not sided with his mother in the divorce.)\n\nKansas allows a defendant instead to offer evidence of mental disease to argue he is incapable of forming intent to commit the crime.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer said the case raised \u201cquite deep\u201d questions. He wondered about one \u201ccrazy\u201d defendant who killed someone because he believed the person was a dog, and another who killed someone he knew was a person but did it because he believed a dog had told him to do it.\n\n\u201cWhy does Kansas say one is guilty, the other is not guilty?\u201d Breyer asked.\n\nKagan also found the case raised deep questions but said she doubted the outcome will mean much for Kahler. In no state, Kagan told Kahler\u2019s lawyer Sarah Schrup, \u201cwould your client be found insane.\u201d\n\nThe case is Kahler v.
