Though the demonstrations initially focused on the new fees \u2013 garnering it the title of \u201cTax Intifada\u201d in media reports \u2013 they soon broadened to more general complaints about government corruption and mismanagement.\n\nSince last Thursday, hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered in the streets, with many erecting barricades with burning tires, shutting down roads across the country. Demonstrators have clashed intermittently with security forces.\n\nMuch of the anger has been directed at Prime Minister Saad Hariri, whose cabinet passed emergency reforms on Monday in hopes of addressing the public outcry.\n\nThe 17-point reform plan repealed some of the tax proposals, slashed the salaries of ministers and lawmakers in half, introduced new taxes on profits in the banking sector and made other efforts to rein in the government\u2019s budget deficit. Lebanon currently has one of the largest public debts as a share of economic output in the world.\n\n\u201cYou are the compass and ... your movement frankly is what led us to this decision today,\u201d Hariri said in a televised address on Monday, adding that while the reforms will not meet all of the protesters\u2019 demands, they are a significant step toward fighting corruption and waste.\n\nHow a proposed tax on WhatsApp calls and other messaging services has led to a nationwide strike in Lebanon @RaniaKhalekpic.twitter.com/ILycLTbDtR \u2014 In the NOW (@IntheNow_tweet) October 21, 2019\n\nSchools, banks and other businesses remained closed on Monday, along with a number of roads across the country, as street protests appear set to continue, despite Monday\u2019s emergency reforms.\n\nAlso on rt.com Lebanon\u2019s \u2018tax intifada\u2019: Beirut aflame as protesters call for \u2018downfall of the regime\u2019 (VIDEOS)\n\nLike this story?
