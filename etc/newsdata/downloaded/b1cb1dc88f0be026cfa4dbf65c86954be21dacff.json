The 32-year-old fan gets a pair of high top chairs set up behind a counter, giving him plenty of space for food and drink, in a spacious area perched near the rafters behind a net.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than watching hockey in person,\u201d Larson said recently while watching Detroit hosted Chicago in a preseason game.\n\nThe Red Wings, and every other NHL team, hope there are a lot of people who agree with him.\n\nDetroit is desperately trying to keep hockey fans filing into its arena, which is a little more than two years old, as the allure of the spectacular facility wears off while the team trudges through a multiyear rebuild.\n\nThe Red Wings overcame the lack of success on the ice last season to be at 98 percent of capacity on average. They ranked in the middle of the pack in a league that generally is able to draw fans to watch its high-speed, full-contact product in person. Ten teams averaged sellouts and just five of 31 franchises had an average attendance last season that didn\u2019t fill at least 90 percent of their arenas.\n\nWhile Detroit did not have trouble selling tickets last year, it wasn\u2019t always playing in front of a packed house because some fans simply couldn\u2019t get people to take and use their tickets. To make unoccupied seats stand out less on TV for Red Wings and Pistons games, the red material covering chairs has been replaced by black to blend in throughout Little Caesars Arena.\n\n\u201cIt was an expensive choice,\u201d Larson said. \u201cI would\u2019ve hated to foot the bill for it.\u201d\n\nNHL teams are invested in enhancing game-day experiences, knowing there\u2019s a lot at stake to keep them coming to arenas instead of staying at home.\n\nFranchises with a lot of fans at their games strive for ways to keep them and those who regularly have empty patches of seats are trying to come up with creative ways to get people to witness the sport in person.\n\n\u201cOur biggest competitor is Netflix,\u201d San Jose Sharks vice president Doug Bentz said. \u201cThe one advantage we have over Netflix is you\u2019re a part of a community at a Sharks game. We want more of that in our world where so many are stuck on devices in isolation or binge-watching on a couch maybe with one other person.\u201d\n\nOn streets and in living rooms, St. Louis is still buzzing from its first Stanley Cup.\n\nThe Blues will raise a championship banner on Oct. 2 before opening the season against the Washington Capitals. Blues season-ticket holder Mike Buschhorn plans to be there for the party, deciding not to cash in on his tickets by selling them and watching the festivities on TV.\n\n\u201cYou have to be at a hockey game in person to get it,\u201d the Blues fan said. \u201cTV doesn\u2019t do it justice. It is the most exciting sport to be at.\u201d\n\nThe price of tickets, however, plays a part in keeping some fans at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot cheaper for a 12 pack on the weekends,\u201d Blues fan John Fuchs said.\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have gotten creative, trying to climb up from the bottom of the NHL\u2019s attendance figures in terms of percentage of capacity. Carolina sold a little more than three-fourths of its tickets last season to rank ahead of only Ottawa after a three-year run of being last in the league.\n\nThe Raleigh, North Carolina-based team has been offering monthly subscription passes, giving fans access to a certain number of games for a one-time fee at a substantial savings compared to individual tickets. The mobile-only, ticket-selling innovation has become relatively common in Major League Baseball, but the Hurricanes are a unique team in the NHL to try it.\n\n\u201cIt gets people in the building for an affordable price,\u201d Hurricanes vice president Mike Forman said. \u201cWe think if we can get people to a game, they\u2019re hooked.\u201d\n\nRed Wings fan Melanie Bidwell was one of the many hooked on hockey in the Motor City for years, proudly counting herself as a season-ticket holder for more than a decade. When the team moved from Joe Louis to Little Caesars Arena two years ago, she continued to buy season tickets.\n\nLast season, she gave up her tickets as her family got busier and doesn\u2019t regret it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing against the Red Wings, we still love them, but it\u2019s not convenient to get to games when you\u2019re juggling work schedules and a 9-year-old boy playing hockey,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m excited that the season is starting again, but our family priorities will keep us at home watching games on TV so we can get our kid in bed for school and we can get up for work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFreelance writer Joe Harris in St. Louis contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Detroit Red Wings season-ticket holder Matt Larson pays about $74 for two of the cheapest seats in Little Caesars Arena.
