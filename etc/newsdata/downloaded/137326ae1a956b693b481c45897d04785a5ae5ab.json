As dawn broke this morning on Dorset beach (above) much of the country was preparing for wet conditions\n\nCars were seen ploughing through the water this morning splashing water at other cars as they drove by on Tower Bridge\n\nMr Miall added: 'This is likely to to be heavy and the impact in these areas could be higher. As much as 60mm of rain, there is a risk of some flooding and chance of travel disruption as well as surface flooding.\n\n'In some places 60mm is about half a months rain fall, not everywhere will see 60mm and this is a worst case scenario. The UK average for October is 100mm, southern England is usually a bit less and Scotland would be a bit more.\n\n'For example East Anglia's average for October is about 65mm, so some places could see a month's worth of rain over the course of the next couple of days.'\n\nMeanwhile, temperatures for today will feel cool as clouds and rain will make it feel chillier than the average of 51.8F (11C), which is below average for this time of year.\n\nThe south west of the country could see highs of 62.6F (17C), and will have relatively light winds that will feel pleasant.\n\nMr Miall also said that the rain will clear away towards the end of the day leaving cloud and some fog patches.\n\n'The west will become clearer due to another frontal system coming it. It will be raining tomorrow morning in the west while the east will be dry.\n\n'Through Monday rain will move from west to east, there will be heavy rain in the west but it will weaken as it goes east. There is still risk of 20mm across north west England, but we have no weather warnings for tomorrow.'\n\nTomorrow it is set to feel cool and once that clears on Monday night the UK will have some low pressure and there will then be some sunshine and showers, with gales in the north west.\n\nThe Environment Agency had last night (Sunday) issued 54 flood alerts and five more serious 'immediate action required' flood warnings.\n\nWestern and northern areas will be most at risk although alerts are in place across much of northern England and parts of the southeast.\n\nAn Environment Agency spokesman said: \"Land, roads and some properties could flood and there could be travel disruption.\"", "description": "Heavy rain is set to disrupt roads, trains and buses across Britain today, just days after the country was struck by extensive flooding.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/10/19357924-0-image-a-11_1570355990088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
