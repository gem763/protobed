My 2-year-old has a calmer demeanor when one of her PJ Masks characters falls somewhere she can\u2019t quite reach it than the average Democratic journalist or Member of Congress are when discussing the Trump administration.\n\nBut unserious people with serious power are a danger. These people have votes in Congress or millions of people who believe what they say, no matter how absurd, wrong, or biased they may be. When they add their twist to a story, it has the ability to become \u201ctruth\u201d to their audience. That\u2019s a lot of power.\n\nYou expect this from elected Democrats. They\u2019re politicians. But journalists are supposed to be different.\n\nSo when the New York Times reports on a Department of Justice probe of the origins of the Russia hoax morphing into a criminal investigation, how it is framed is telling, and as important as the story itself. The way they chose to frame it was curious, to say the least.\n\n\u201cFor more than two years, President Trump has repeatedly attacked the Russia investigation, portraying it as a hoax and illegal even months after the special counsel closed it,\u201d the Times story opens, as if a closed investigation could not be a hoax or how the whole thing came into being should not even be wondered about because it was over.\n\nThe \u201cnews\u201d story continues, \u201cThe opening of a criminal investigation is likely to raise alarms that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely to raise alarms\u201d with who? Why? Who, after the promises made that were exposed as lies by the Mueller probe, wouldn\u2019t want to know how it happened, if only to avoid it happening again?\n\nThe fact of the matter is these self-appointed arbiters of truth have no interest in knowing how this fraud began. How it was the spy apparatus that is supposed to be aimed at the rest of the world to keep us safe was directed at American citizens, something expressly forbidden without extreme cause by the laws that govern it.\n\nThe job of journalists is supposed to be to gather as much information as possible and disseminate it to the public. They\u2019re supposed to seek as much of it out as they can for that very purpose. Yet, when it comes to anything remotely related to the origins of the Russia investigation, the curiosity that serves as the cornerstone of what their profession is supposed to be, disappears.\n\n\u201cSerious journalist\u201d Andrea Mitchell, the chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News and also has a show on MSNBC where she opines on domestic politics, opened her discussion on the investigation by declaring the concept \u201ctracks closely\u201d with what is being discussed \u201cin right-wing media.\u201d Again, curious, narrative-enforcing framing.\n\nMitchell then brought on two guests, both former Obama administration officials (for balance, naturally) who proceeded to dismiss the idea as a \u201cdebunked conspiracy theory\u201d and lamented how those being questioned would have to hire lawyers because it will cost them money. Mitchell has expressed no such concern for any of the people who\u2019ve had to drain their savings while being dragged before the Special Counsel and Congress countless times for the sin of having worked for the Trump campaign.\n\nThe truth is no news outlet is interested in what happened because of who it happened to. If it were done to Barack Obama, no other story would be covered until they got to the bottom of it. But because it was done by Barack Obama, it might as well not have happened.\n\nDonald Trump and his supporters are not worthy of due process or Constitutional protections in the minds of the left. When he calls them \u201cfake news\u201d it\u2019s a \u201cthreat to democracy,\u201d when they spend years calling him the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, it\u2019s just a day that ends in \u201cy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that journalists are incurious about how the Russia hoax originated, it\u2019s that they\u2019re terrified people will find out. They\u2019re afraid it will implicate their friends, colleagues, and heroes; that it will expose them further as complicit in largest fraud American political history.\n\nMedia Democrats are not serious people, but they do have power. And there are millions of Americans who will believe any and everything someone like Andrea Mitchell, Chuck Todd, or Jim Acosta say, no matter how corrupt, self-serving, divorced from reality, or anti-journalistic it is. That\u2019s why, even though they\u2019re unserious people, they have to be taken seriously.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "Democrats, simply put, are not serious people.
