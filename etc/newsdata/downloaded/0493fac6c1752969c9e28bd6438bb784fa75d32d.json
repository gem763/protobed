Even at the low end of the range, that's more than Netflix's total addressable market of about 700 million subscribers, Barclays found.\n\n\"In other words, Netflix's base of subscribers will have to go up at least [five to eight times] from where it is today in order to justify its present valuation, which will need growth to accelerate rather than slow,\" Venkateshwar said.\n\nNetflix shares fell 2.4% Monday from its previous close of $270.75. Barclays has an overweight rating on the stock with a $375 price target.\n\nThe stock was one of Barclays' picks to analyze with this new framework. It cited Netflix as one of the fastest-growing in media that simultaneously is one of the trickiest companies to value. Additionally, Netflix market share is still only beginning to grow internationally, where Venkateshwar says investors expect the company to get many more subscribers.\n\nBut he said Netflix can't reach beyond its total addressable market, so it will have to find significant other sources of revenue, such as advertising. In that case, the company's present valuation represents the pricing power strength it has over competitors and the decline in subscriber turnover, otherwise known as \"churn.\"", "description": "Barclays unveils \"a new valuation framework for growth companies.\"", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104226648-GettyImages-543270562.jpg?v=1569255011", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
