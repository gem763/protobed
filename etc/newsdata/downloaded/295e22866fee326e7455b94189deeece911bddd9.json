They are called the bomb squad and they have their own thing going on. #Springboks #Mapimpi pic.twitter.com/6afbkV7PtM \u2014 Chunky Amateur Afro (@owasendle) October 5, 2019\n\n'It was a standing joke in the team and the whole week that Lood de Jager, who was now in the starting line-up, was out of the Bomb Squad,' Erasmus said in Kobe on Sunday.\n\n'So at the end of the game, when the Bomb Squad was getting together, Lood was on his way there and Frans Steyn told him, 'you are not part of the squad anymore' and gestured for him to go away.\n\n'Mapimpi was on his way over to them at the same time, saw it was the Bomb Squad and just turned around. It's so sad that people would see something negative in it because I can give you my word, as a head coach I would not allow anything like that in the team.'\n\nThe video sparked outrage on social media, with one Twitter user posting: 'This is clear division if you don't see it you need a real help.' Another added: 'The really sad part of the #Mapimpi #Bombsquad @Springboks racism affair is that he, the victim, is being made to protect his violators, in the process further humiliating himself. Abuse on a national level.'\n\nMapimpi had earlier explained in his native Xhosa: 'In the team we have what we call the Bomb Squad, made up of players who start from the bench. They have their own chants and calls.\n\n'As you see what happened yesterday\u2026 normally after a game, we shake hands with the opposition. So, at the time where you see the bomb squad meet up, they were about to call out their chant.\n\n'As I was walking after the handshakes, I saw the Bomb Squad in a huddle and realised it's just them, and I retreated. Otherwise there's nothing to it, we're united.'\n\nThe six white players in the video were all replacements while Mapimpi started.\n\nThe Springboks were once an iconic symbol of white South Africa and the integration of players from other races since the end of Apartheid and first democratic elections 25 years ago has been a long and often politically-charged process.\n\nNelson Mandela handing South Africa's captain Francois Pienaar the World Cup trophy in 1995\n\nThe 1995 World Cup was seen as a pivotal moment in South Africa's long fight against racism\n\nIt has been a difficult week for the Boks off the field as the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) confirmed they would open a case against lock Eben Etzebeth over allegations he physically and racially abused a patron in a bar in late August.\n\nEtzebeth has vehemently denied any wrong-doing, but is likely to have to defend himself against the charges in South Africa's Equality Court, which hears civil cases, when he returns from the World Cup.\n\nIt has divided opinion in the nation as to whether Etzebeth should be in Japan at all, and stoked conversation about racism as South Africa struggles to reconcile with its Apartheid past.\n\nErasmus, who played 36 times for the Springboks around the turn of the century, said this was one of the most tight-knit South Africa teams he had been involved in.\n\n'I have been part of a lot of Springbok teams and this is one where there are not a lot of egos,' he said. 'We have picked the best guys in South Africa and there are so many different cultures and languages.\n\n'I think this team is representing the country with a lot of pride and we are really united. No-one can points fingers at this team.'", "description": "TV cameras caught six white players appearing to exclude Makazole Mapimpi from their celebrations following the Italy victory and Erasmus felt obliged to offer a detailed explanation of events.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Michael Boniface For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/18/19366198-0-image-a-106_1570382807510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
