In the morning we come to school to find them all over,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do. We\u2019ve been battling with these problems for years. What will happen if our parents and pupils get attacked. The buck stops with me but without assistance [from authorities] there\u2019s nothing I can do.\n\n\u201cI will never forgive myself if something happens,\u201d Louw said.\n\nMeanwhile, garbage is also piling up uncollected for weeks on Prince Alfred Street outside Marion High School.\n\nComplaints of uncollected garbage have risen recently because of a recent strike by Msunduzi\u2019s waste staff. The City got a court order to send workers back to their jobs.\n\nThe problem of uncollected garbage has, however, been a perennial issue, with The Witness running several \u201ccity of filth\u201d reports.\n\nMsunduzi did not respond to a query on Tuesday.", "description": "St Christopher\u2019s special needs school in the city is faced with an infestation of rats due to the unsightly illegal dumping of rubbish, and staff, parents and children feel threatened by vagrants in the area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8590/89b6dd9427074f62a2b75e5f9964af6e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-06"}
