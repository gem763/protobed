Show Hide What was Operation Midland? Operation Midland was set up by the Metropolitan police in November 2014 to examine allegations of child sexual abuse and homicide. It was based on false claims by Carl Beech, known as \"Nick\", that he was abused by public figures of authority from 1975 to 1984, and witnessed the abuse of others. He made widely reported false allegations about being taken to parties at exclusive private members\u2019 clubs, in Dolphin Square in London and other locations \u2013 including swimming pools \u2013 attended by among others the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, the then chief of defence staff Lord Bramall, the ex-MI5 chief Sir Michael Hanley, as well as the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. Operation MIdland was closed in March 2016 with no charges brought. Beech was jailed for 18 years in July 2019 for making the claims. He is appealing against the conviction and the sentence.\n\nA 2016 report into the investigation said it was \u2018riddled with errors\u2019, identifying 43 individual errors made by officers, that the team misled a judge to get search warrants, and finding that five officers, including four detectives and a deputy assistant commissioner, would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for failings.\n\n\n\nIt has now emerged, after the publication of a fuller version of Sir Richard Henriques\u2019 report, that officers agreed to tell the media they believed the accuser, then known as \u201cNick\u201d, whose claims sparked the ill-fated inquiry.\n\nIt led to Det Sgt Kenny McDonald informing the media at the outset of the investigation in 2014 that officers believed the claims made by Carl Beech were \u201ccredible and true\u201d. Beech was jailed for 18 years in July, having falsely alleged he was a victim of a VIP paedophile ring that had also killed three boys. All his claims were made up.\n\nThe report also sheds light on the extent of the role of Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who met Beech and encouraged him to go to the police with his claims. The report finds that the main cause of Scotland Yard\u2019s disastrous inquiry was \u201cpoor judgment and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts\u201d.\n\nThe 391-page report, which has sparked criticism that Scotland Yard is guilty of \u201cinstitutional stupidity\u201d, reveals:\n\n\u2022 Warrants to search the homes of wrongly accused suspects were obtained \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cshould not have taken place\u201d. Police \u201cmisled\u201d the magistrate who authorised the search by describing Beech\u2019s allegations as \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d.\n\n\u2022 The premeditated decision by officers to publicly say they believed Beech was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d. \u201cI cannot conceive that any fully informed officer could reasonably have believed \u2018Nick\u2019,\u201d the report says.\n\n\u2022 Watson\u2019s interest in Operation Midland \u201ccreated further pressure upon officers\u201d. Reviewing how to engage with the politician was listed among \u201cinvestigative priorities\u201d by a senior officer.\n\nBeech, a former nurse, alleged he was among the victims of an \u201cestablishment group\u201d \u2013 including politicians and military figures \u2013 who kidnapped, raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 1980s. He accused the former prime minister Edward Heath, the ex-home secretary Leon Brittan, the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, and the D-day veteran Field Marshal Edwin Bramall of being abusers. The homes of Lord Brittan, Lord Bramall and Proctor were raided as part of the disastrous 16-month inquiry.\n\nThe report\u2019s publication has prompted Proctor to call for the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, to \u201cconsider her position\u201d. At the outset of Operation Midland, Dick still oversaw sexual abuse and murder investigations in her role as assistant commissioner of specialist operations. Proctor\u2019s counsel Geoffrey Robertson QC said Operation Midland operated \u201calmost with institutional stupidity\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the home secretary, Priti Patel, responded to the findings by ordering an investigation into the Met to maintain \u201cpublic confidence\u201d in Britain\u2019s biggest force.\n\nThe original version of the report, published by the Metropolitan police on the same day as the US presidential election in November 2016 in an apparent bid to bury coverage, found 43 failings by investigators and said detectives fell for Beech\u2019s story.\n\nThe fuller version of the report discloses how McDonald, who retired on the eve of Beech\u2019s trial, and deputy assistant commissioner (DAC) Steve Rodhouse, now director of general operations at the National Crime Agency, agreed to publicly back Beech.\n\nOn 18 December 2014, prior to a press conference with the media about Operation Midland, Rodhouse wrote: \u201cI anticipate that Kenny or I will be asked if we \u2018believe\u2019 \u2018Nick\u2019. This is a significant issue and one with the potential to provide either reassurance or concern to other witnesses.\n\n\u201cAny indication that we will doubt the word of victims will undermine our efforts for them to come forward and will damage our relationship with \u2018Nick\u2019 ... Decision: If asked we will confirm that we do believe \u2018Nick\u2019 but that, as in any case, his evidence will need to be tested before it can be read out in a court.\u201d\n\nMcDonald subsequently told the media: \u201cNick has been spoken to by experienced officers from the child abuse team and experienced officers from the murder investigation team. They and I believe what Nick is saying is credible and true.\u201d\n\nHenriques criticised the move in his report, writing: \u201cI find it an error for two very senior officers who have never met a witness and, in the DAC\u2019s case, not himself read either \u2018Nick\u2019s\u2019 interviews or blogs, to announce to the press and public that they believe the witness.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, the Met conceded that it had been wrong to suggest that it was pre-empting the result of the inquiry by earlier declaring its key witness\u2019s account to be \u201ccredible and true\u201d.\n\nAsked about how concerned she was when she heard that Beech\u2019s claims were \u201ccredible and true\u201d, Dick told LBC last month: \u201cSo I think everybody thinks that that was just a mistake, it shouldn\u2019t have been said.\u201d\n\nHenriques says in his report that Watson\u2019s intervention over a separate 1967 rape allegation against Brittan left officers \u201cin a state of panic\u201d, and that he \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d Brittan. He says the Met was wrong to subject Brittan to an interview over the rape claim, and ignored the view of one of its senior detectives that there was no case to answer.\n\nBeech was found guilty after a 10-week trial at Newcastle crown court of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud over a \u00a322,000 criminal compensation payout. He is himself a convicted paedophile after pleading guilty to possessing child sexual abuse images in a separate trial earlier this year.", "description": "Publication also reveals extent of deputy Labour leader\u2019s role in failed Operation Midland", "authors": ["Simon Murphy", "Vikram Dodd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dc4f7959cd370becf815cc0e9abab250612d52/5_204_1096_657/master/1096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94bbf7771398cb6d798a815ac962e1d5", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
