He will hope to have at least one of Toni Kroos, Gareth Bale and Luka Modric back fit again.\n\nMadrid\u2019s surprise loss was made all the more painful as Barcelona marched to their fifth consecutive win, 3-0 at Eibar. Goals from Antoine Griezmann, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez got the \u2018MSG\u2019 attack up and running and sent Barca back top of the table.\n\n\u2013 Profligacy costs Bayern \u2013\n\nIt was a bad weekend for Bayern Munich, as the Bundesliga champions conceded a last-minute equaliser to draw 2-2 away to Bavarian rivals Augsburg, paying the price for missing a hatful of chances to wrap up the points.\n\nAfter a 2-1 defeat at home to Hoffenheim just before the international break, this latest setback put pressure back on coach Niko Kovac and left Bayern third in the table, a point behind leading duo Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg.\n\nTo add to Kovac\u2019s woes, Bayern were dealt a major blow with the news that German international centre-back Niklas Suele will miss the rest of the season after suffering a serious knee injury in that game.\n\n\u2013 Monaco for glitz, glamour\u2026and goals \u2013\n\nMonte Carlo resident Novak Djokovic was in the stands on Sunday to watch his local team Monaco in action against Rennes in Ligue 1 and there were goals aplenty for the tennis world number one.\n\nThe principality side beat Rennes 3-2 at the Stade Louis II thanks to a stoppage-time Wissam Ben Yedder goal, his second of the game. In between, Islam Slimani also netted for Monaco. The duo have now combined for 13 league goals in total this season.\n\nOnly leaders Paris Saint-Germain have scored more goals than Monaco\u2019s 18 in 10 Ligue 1 games this season. Yet Monaco have conceded 21, more than any other team. That explains why they are only 14th in the table.\n\n\u2013 Ajax surge clear of PSV \u2013\n\nAjax warmed up for their Champions League clash with Chelsea by opening up a three-point lead at the top of the Dutch Eredivisie after Quincy Promes crashed in a late strike to seal a 2-1 win at RKC Waalwijk.\n\nDusan Tadic had opened the scoring for the reigning champions, who remain unbeaten after 10 league games and are clear at the top of the table after PSV Eindhoven suffered their first defeat of the season in comprehensive fashion, going down 3-0 away at Utrecht.\n\n\u2013 Pioli sees \u2018positives\u2019 for Milan \u2013\n\nStefano Pioli insisted he saw \u201cpositives\u201d that AC Milan could haul themselves back up the Serie A table despite his first game as coach ending in a 2-2 draw against Lecce.\n\nHakan Calhanoglu and Krzysztof Piatek scored in either half but each time Lecce responded with Marco Calderoni sealing a point for the southerners at the death.\n\n\u201cThere were positives, but we can only blame ourselves, we wanted the win and didn\u2019t get it because of our mistakes,\u201d said Pioli after succeeding Marco Giampaolo, who was sacked after just seven games in charge.\n\n\u201cAfter only a few days of training, I did see some of the ideas we had worked on and that bodes well for the future, even if there is a lot of work to be done.\u201d\n\nThe seven-time European champions are a lowly 12th in the table after eight games.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Barcelona replaced Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, Bayern Munich squandered the chance to go back on top in Germany, and Monaco", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/736272_it-was-bad-weekend-karim-benzema-real-madrid-as-defeat-mallorca-allowed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
