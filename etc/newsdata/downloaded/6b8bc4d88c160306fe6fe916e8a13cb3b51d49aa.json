excluded from the Sochi agreement - hundreds demonstrated against the deal on Wednesday, saying it amounted to ethnic cleansing and genocide.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, Turkey said it had been informed by the U.S. that their withdrawal from the border areas had been 'completed'.\n\n'At this stage, there is no further need to carry out a new operation,' the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Erdogan vowed that Turkey would take 'the necessary steps' if Russian and American promises to push Kurdish fighters away were not kept.\n\nHis foreign minister said today that Turkish forces will \"neutralize\" any remaining Syrian Kurdish fighter they come across.\n\nErdogan wants a buffer zone on the border against the Kurdish fighters, whom he considers terrorists.\n\nDonald Trump declared today that captured ISIS prisoners had been 'secured' as he hailed the deal and said the Kurds were 'safe and have worked very nicely with us'.\n\nDeclaring that the ceasefire would become 'permanent', Trump said he was lifting sanctions which were imposed on Turkey after the invasion began.\n\nWashington recently began moving Ankara from a joint F-35 fighter jet production programme, but Turkey insisted today that those differences could be overcome.\n\nHowever, a a top U.S. official warned that more than 100 ISIS prisoners had escaped since Turkey's invasion began.\n\nJames Jeffrey told Congress that the State Department 'does not know where they are', amid fears of a mass jailbreak amid the chaos in the region.\n\nDetention camps in Syria are believed to be holding more than 10,000 militants, including some 2,000 foreign fighters.\n\nKurdish fighters have previously warned they do not have the resources to guard the prisons but are still doing so at the moment, the special envoy said.\n\nTrump insisted soon afterwards that some of the escaped prisoners had already been recaptured.\n\nTurkey said there was 'no need' to resume its military onslaught when a five-day ceasefire ended last night -

'Both Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have fought against ISIS,' said James Jeffrey, a U.S. special envoy for Syria. 'If they are not forced to face off against each other, we can rely on both of them against ISIS,' he said. Jeffrey told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he was not consulted by President Donald Trump until after the start of the Turkish offensive in Syria. 'We've done a pretty good job of bringing this attack to a halt,' Jeffrey said. 'Turkey has not really gained all that much from this.' He estimated that the number of Kurdish victims of Turkey's advance was 'in the low hundreds.' But he said that Turkish-supported Syrian opposition forces 'in at least one instance did carry out a war crime - and we have reached out to Turkey to demand an explanation.'\n\nKurdish fighters in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were key to defeating ISIS in Syria earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Turkey regards the Kurdish fighters as terrorists and wants a buffer zone against them on its southern border.\n\nPresident Trump abruptly pulled out U.S. forces earlier this month, clearing the way for the long-planned Turkish offensive.\n\nHis decision has been widely seen as a betrayal and Trump invited ridicule by declaring that the Kurds 'didn't help us with Normandy'.\n\nHe was also widely mocked for an oddly-worded letter in which he told Erdogan: 'Don't be a fool'.\n\nA senior Russian diplomat said today that Moscow expects the United States to shut down its one remaining military base in southern Syria.\n\nThe 'illegitimate' U.S. presence should end to let the Syrian government fully reclaim control over the country, deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin said.\n\nSince the Turkish offensive began on October 9, at least 114 civilians have been killed and some 300,000 people have been displaced.\n\nVladimir Putin's presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, joined in that criticism today.\n\n'The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds over the past few years. But in the end, the US abandoned the Kurds, actually betraying them,' he said.\n\n'The US opted to abandon the Kurds on the border, almost forcing them to fight against the Turks.'\n\nA former head of the U.S. military made the same point. Retired Admiral Mike Mullen said Erdogan 'would not send those troops across that border if the Americans were there.'\n\nThe Kurds claim that Turkish operations are continuing and a mystery explosion in the border town of Ras al-Ayn caused injuries yesterday\n\nMedics wipe a man's face after he was injured in the blast in Ras al-Ain - which took place despite Turkey's claims that it has stopped its military offensive\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Vladmir Putin meet in the resort of Sochi for a summit to discuss the future of Syria\n\nRussia-Turkey deal 'shatters hopes' of Kurdish self-rule The deal between Erdogan and Putin yesterday deals a major blow to hopes of Kurdish autonomy, experts say. Syria's Kurds had hoped that their efforts to help crush the ISIS 'caliphate' would pay off. But instead of supporting their political project, the United States is pulling out of Syria altogether and Russia and Turkey are now carving up the country. The Kurds still controlled close to a third of Syria two weeks ago and have now lost almost everything. Under the agreement, Turkey was granted the right to remain fully deployed in an Arab-majority area it has dubbed a 'safe zone'. The zone stretches along 75 miles and is 20 miles deep, forming a zone into which Erdogan wants to send back some of the 3.6million Syrian refugees his country hosts. 'For the Kurds, this is the end of Rojava [the autonomous region], of their dreams of autonomy,' said Fabrice Balanche, a geographer specialising in Syrian affairs.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the area of the 'safe zone' was calm late on Tuesday.\n\nErdogan had earlier threatened to resume Ankara's military offensive if the Kurds did not withdraw.\n\nThe Turkish operation 'is ending, and everything will depend now on the implementation of these agreements,' Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.\n\nRussian forces moved in last week to support the Syrian army, whose help against Turkey was requested by the Kurds.\n\nMoscow is a key ally of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who yesterday branded Erdogan a 'thief' for his incursion into Syria.\n\nAssad called the Turkish President a 'thief who robbed factories, wheat and fuel and is today stealing territory', according to state media.\n\nErdogan said last week he was not bothered by the Damascus regime's return.\n\nAnkara has also said that some of the 3.6million Syrian refugees in Turkey can be rehoused inside the safe zone.\n\nToday the U.S. and Nato gave a cautious welcome to a German proposal for an internationally enforced security zone.\n\n'I welcome that NATO allies have proposals on how to move forward,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said it was 'certainly a positive' but indicated that Washington would not be involved.\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel threw her support behind the idea yesterday, telling conservative MPs that the idea was 'very promising, even if there are many questions'.\n\nAngry Kurds have blocked US troops in the streets as they cross from Syria into Iraq in a display of hostility after Washington pulled the plug on their support\n\nU.S. troops leaving Syria and heading to Iraq yesterday in a withdrawal which has opened the way for a Turkish invasion and thrust Syria back into the international spotlight\n\n'We cannot just stand by and watch and not do anything,' Berlin's defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told German television.\n\nBut the defence minister's plan - which could even see German troops deployed - has already met with resistance from Merkel's coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD).\n\nIn addition, the use of military force remains a highly sensitive subject in Germany because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nThe U.S. has indicated that some of its withdrawn troops may stay in western Iraq to continue the fight against ISIS.\n\nBut Iraq appeared to throw those plans into disarray yesterday by saying the Americans had no permission to stay there.\n\nToday the Iraqi PM confirmed that position, saying Baghdad was taking 'all international legal measures'.\n\nAngry Kurds have blocked U.S. troops in the streets as they cross from Syria into Iraq after Washington pulled the plug on their support.\n\nAmerican troops were even pelted with potatoes as they passed through a Syrian town on their way to Iraq on Monday.\n\nThe Pentagon is now considering keeping a small U.S. force in north-eastern Syria to protect oilfields and Trump indicated today that a few troops would remain there.\n\n'We have secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil,' the President said.\n\nThe United States currently has 5,200 troops posted in Iraq, deployed as part of a Washington-led coalition against the ISIS jihadists.\n\nThe U.S. presence at several bases across Iraq is already controversial, with numerous political groups and pro-Iran Shiite armed groups demanding their expulsion.", "description": "WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: The Turks and a group of\u00a0Syrian rebels displayed their emblems in Ras al-Ain, a border town where Kurdish fighters have been forced out by Turkey's offensive.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20089654-0-image-a-2_1571844142208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
