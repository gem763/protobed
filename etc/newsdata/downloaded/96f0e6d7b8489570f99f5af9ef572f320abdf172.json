Mark Meadows (R-NC), Jim Jordan (R-OH), and Lee Zeldin (R-NY) called for the release the full Volker transcript.\n\nJordan wrote in a tweet Friday, \u201cWhen the American people get to read the transcript of Ambassador Volker\u2019s testimony, they will see: -No quid pro quo -No pressure AND they\u2019ll see that everyone involved was working both for America\u2019s interests and for the success and security of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhen the American people get to read the transcript of Ambassador Volker\u2019s testimony, they will see: -No quid pro quo\n\n-No pressure AND they\u2019ll see that everyone involved was working both for America\u2019s interests and for the success and security of Ukraine. \u2014 Rep.
