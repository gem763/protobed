We sent one of our junior reporters to a place up north that we\u2019ve only heard of because it\u2019s in the fourth division of the football league, to see what local people say in a funny accent.\u201d Then you hear a series of pensioners shout: \u201cEe, I like Boris, he may be a sociopath and evil to t\u2019 core but at least he\u2019s getting on with it, not like thee.\u201d\n\nAnd you can see the appeal of the idea we should just get on with it, rather than faff about, worrying about government reports that we\u2019ll be living off boiled caterpillars until we\u2019re taken over by Taiwan.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s the same when someone burgles your house. You don\u2019t want them to keep you waiting all day by assessing your belongings. Just shove everything in a bag and GET ON WITH ROBBING ME.\n\nPart of this despair must come from sensing we\u2019re only spectators, with no role in shaping any of this, except trying to make sense of the daily madness. So each day we hear: \u201cToday is likely to be critical, as a cross-party group of MPs table an antelope bill, which will reclassify Brexit as a creature of the forest. This will enable the Speaker to allow a fourth sitting of Benn/Letwin/Henry VIII Act in which an extension must be applied for if MPs shout \u2018Are we antelopes?

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThen there\u2019s a discussion about how it will be very tight because some Labour MPs are planning to rebel by drowning out the debate with hardcore drum and bass to respect the wishes of their constituents, and you fall into a trance and wish it was all over.\n\nAnd this is Johnson\u2019s selling point. He gets on with it, because he\u2019s not like those other stodgy politicians. He\u2019s not bound by elitist codes, such as the one that suggests if you print something as a fact in huge letters it ought to be vaguely factual.\n\nFor too long we\u2019ve put up with politicians who make pathetic attempts to cover up their lies, and at last we\u2019ve got one who lies and doesn\u2019t bother trying to cover it up.\n\nUnlike the shifty types who have been in charge, sneakily arranging for contracts and honours to be awarded to friends, he just hands public money for businesses to people with no particular business but who do invite him round to look at their dancing pole. He didn\u2019t ask Jennifer Arcuri to fill in lots of forms and show drawings of the dancing pole, he just got on with it.\n\nInstead of fussing about, he\u2019s won support from Donald Trump, who\u2019s willing to just get on with a trade deal that must include selling off parts of the NHS to US companies. For years we\u2019ve been waiting to pay \u00a3200 a day to stay in the Nike cardiac ward after a heart attack, and at last we can JUST DO IT, as long as Johnson can get his way, and not be obstructed by politicians who allowed our country to be run by foreigners.\n\nIt\u2019s a wonderful technique he\u2019s mastered, to be from the highest strata of the establishment, determined to swipe everything for the establishment, and appear anti-establishment. It\u2019s like the Pope managing to get elected as leader of the DUP, because, at last, here is someone who is truly sick of Catholics.\n\nFor example, he had to send a letter he said he would never sign, to apply for an extension he said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than seek. But instead of this being a humiliation, he fooled people into thinking he was still a cheeky urchin because he didn\u2019t sign the thing.\n\nThis didn\u2019t mean anything, as the letter counts whether he signed it or not. But even as a stunt, it lacked imagination. If he was really anti-establishment, he\u2019d have signed the letter in rabbit droppings, nailed onto the back of a packet of Coco Pops. Or he\u2019d have asked Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg to send an Instagram clip of them performing the letter in interpretive dance.\n\nThere is obviously a deep division in Britain, not just about Brexit, but about what sort of society we should create; whether it should encourage immigration, ask the wealthiest to pay to look after the vulnerable, not sell arms to psychopaths, and take some trouble not to fry the planet, or not bother with any of that because everything is the fault of someone or other who\u2019s on benefits and probably foreign.\n\nThe one thing almost everyone is agreed on is that the old way of running things did leave millions of people poor, unstable and neglected, and has to be changed.\n\nBut Brexit is the issue around which this argument has revolved. So in general, those in favour of a more liberal world are on one side of the Brexit debate, and those who oppose it support the other.\n\nTo add to the confusion, Jeremy Corbyn appears to prefer to try and ignore the contest everyone is talking about, and concentrate on the subjects he\u2019d rather discuss, such as schools and hospitals.\n\nThe trouble is, this is like being a judge at Crufts, and when asked who you think should win, saying: \u201cI prefer cats.\u201d\n\nAnd the Liberal Democrats\u2019 main objective is to be as foul as possible about Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson could threaten to drop a nuclear bomb on Wiltshire, and when Jo Swinson was asked for a statement, she\u2019d say: \u201cJeremy Corbyn stinks like a polecat.\u201d\n\nBut if somehow Johnson wins an election, he\u2019ll turn to Jacob Rees-Mogg and say \u201cthe idiots have fallen for it\u201d in Latin. Then he\u2019ll get on with it. And then we\u2019ll all be in trouble.", "description": "Over the past few weeks, you\u2019ve often heard a valuable new feature on news programmes, one that helps us understand modern Britain.", "authors": ["Mark Steel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/02/Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
