Santa Monica police Sgt. D. Hicks said after approximately ten minutes of exchanging taunts and chants, \u201ceverything went to crap.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nA video posted to YouTube shows a man wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat approaching the anti-Trump protesters and then dousing the crowd with a steady stream of what police say was bear repellent.\n\nWhile some anti-Trump protesters were screaming and others scattered in an attempt to avoid the spray, the man in the MAGA hat went towards an anti-Trump protester who was being held on the ground by Trump supporters and sprayed him.\n\nThe video also shows that before the man in the MAGA hat was arrested, he pled with police, claiming anti-Trump protesters attacked him, calling them \u201cfucking libtards\u201d and \u201ccommies.\u201d The video showed no such thing.\n\nPolice said that the man had a \u201cfairly extensive\u201d criminal record. And after viewing the video, they believe another man may have also sprayed the crowd too. None of the protesters were seriously injured.\n\nNews that connects violence and those who support President Donald Trump is a common occurrence. Just last week a video surfaced that depicted a fake Trump massacring members of the news media. The video was shown during a conference at one of the president\u2019s resorts in Miami.\n\nWith an impeachment inquiry underway, Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric, going after the whistleblower and tweeting about a civil war, which some think could provoke armed extremists who support him to be moved to public violence.\n\nA single incident in California cannot be laid at the feet of the president, but it is concerning that the man in the White House does more to stoke anger and fear within his most unstable supporters than he does to calm them.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
