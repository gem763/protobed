There will be shooting stars, and plenty of them with the peak of the Orionid meteor shower. Accuweather\n\nKeep your eyes to the night sky late Monday night and especially early Tuesday morning \u2013 you might get a peek at the Orionid meteor shower.\n\n\u201cI would rank the Orionids in the top five meteor showers of the year,\u201d AccuWeather astronomy blogger Dave Samuhel said. \u201dIt will be the strongest shower since the Perseids of August ... The Orionids provide 20 to 25 meteors per hour on the peak night.\"\n\nOrionid meteors are debris left behind by Halley's Comet, arguably the most famous of all comets, according to Deborah Byrd of EarthSky.org. \"This comet leaves debris in its wake that strikes Earth\u2019s atmosphere most fully around Oct. 20-22, while Earth intersects the comet\u2019s orbit, as it does every year at this time,\" Byrd said.\n\nSOURCE earthsky.org (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nThe Orionids are some of the fastest and brightest among meteor showers because the Earth is hitting the stream of particles almost head-on, according to Space.com. How fast? Most zip by at 41 miles per second, which translates to about 148,000 mph.\n\nIf the meteors originate from Halley's, why are they called the Orionids?\n\n\"Meteors in annual showers are named for the point in our sky from which they appear to radiate,\" according to Byrd. \"The radiant point for the Orionids is in the direction of the famous constellation Orion the Hunter.\"\n\nTo view the shower, try to avoid light pollution and don't use binoculars or telescopes, Weather.com said. Though the meteors will emanate from the eastern horizon, they will streak across the entire sky and will be visible from anywhere on Earth, according to NASA.\n\nThe best time to view the shower is after midnight, when the constellation Orion rises high above the horizon. \"If you can spot Orion, then get ready for some meteors,\" Samuhel said.\n\nUnfortunately, the moon will be a bit of an issue this year as it will rise just after midnight on the peak night and will be around 50% illuminated, AccuWeather said.\n\nClouds could also cause problems for viewing the shower in the eastern and northwestern U.S., AccuWeather said, noting the best views should be in the central and southwestern parts of the country.\n\nIf you miss this shower, you can still catch the Leonids in November and the Geminds in December.\n\nNOTE As of Oct. 17; SOURCE AccuWeather (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nAn Orionid meteor shoots across the sky on Thursday October 19, 2017. The Orionid meteors appear every year, with showers producing around 20 meteors every hour.
