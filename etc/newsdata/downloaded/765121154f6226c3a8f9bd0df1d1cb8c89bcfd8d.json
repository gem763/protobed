These components have been updated from last year\u2019s vaccine to better match the strains being seen.\n\nThe vaccine also seems well-matched to the two influenza B strains that have been seen so far.\n\nStill, flu seasons can be unpredictable, so it\u2019s best to prepare as if it could be a bad season. The best way to do that? Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older get vaccinated, and October is the perfect time to get your shot \u2014 right before flu is expected to hit.\n\nBut the flu is around all year, Epperson explained. Over the summer, all of the different influenza viruses that are out there were circulating, so no one knows exactly which strain will predominate in the upcoming season, he said.\n\nRegardless of the types of flu viruses in the mix, \u201cthis year\u2019s influenza vaccine is going to be the main pillar of how people can protect themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s important for everyone to get vaccinated, Epperson said. This is particularly important for those at the highest risk for having complications from flu, including children under 5, adults aged 65 and older, pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease or asthma.\n\nGetting your flu shot doesn\u2019t only protect you, he said. \u201cOne of the benefits of influenza vaccine is that you can help protect people around you \u2014 and that\u2019s particularly important,\u201d Epperson said.\n\nSince babies under the age of 6 months cannot be vaccinated, moms, dads and others who are around these infants should get vaccinated so the baby doesn\u2019t catch the flu, he said.\n\nEpperson said that hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized for flu and thousands die from its complications every year. Those most likely to die are the very old and very young, but even young adults and middle-aged people die.\n\nIf you\u2019re vaccinated, you can significantly reduce the odds of being hospitalized for flu, he said. Even if you get the flu, having been vaccinated will make your illness milder.\n\nIf you come down with flu, you should see your doctor for a prescription for antiviral drugs, which can shorten the time you are sick, Epperson said.\n\nAlso, you can take simple steps to prevent catching or spreading the flu, Epperson said. \u201cThese include avoiding contact with people who might be sick, washing your hands frequently, covering your nose and mouth if you do get sick and if you\u2019re coughing or sneezing, that can help prevent the spread of flu to other people.\u201d\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on flu, head to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
