How would the CIA assess the stability of the American government right now, if it were assessing America as if it was another country?\u201d\n\nBRENNAN: We would look at it as a very corrupt government that is under the sway right now of this powerful individual who has been able to just corrupt the institutions and the laws of that country.\n\nTODD: What would you say about the stability of democracy?\n\nBRENNAN: I think it\u2019s no longer a democracy if an autocrat has it in his hands and people like Johnson and others are putty in his hand, which means the democratic principles upon which the country are found are eroding right now.\n\nTODD: The CIA would not say it\u2019s a stable democracy\u201d\n\nBRENNAN: Given the tremendous political instability here which is consuming the government now, it\u2019s not able to take care of the issues that it need to address, whether it be on the domestic front or the foreign policy front.
