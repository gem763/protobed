I get something started, I just don't want to stop,\" LeBlanc, 54, told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\n\"And after a while, it sort of became a challenge. Let's see how many days we can keep going.\"\n\n60th anniversary gift for mom\n\nSo what inspired him to finally break his decades-long streak? His mom, of course.\n\n\"She always said that she'd never see the restaurant closed. So as [a 60th] anniversary gift, I told her I'd close the restaurant for one day,\" he said.\n\n\"She was very happy to see that she'd finally see it close and I wouldn't be working as hard.\"\n\nThe restaurant is closing for a full day on Sept. 18 for the first time in 30 years. (Submitted by Jean LeBlanc)\n\nLeBlanc's parents first opened the shop in 1968 as an ice cream stand, according to the Digby Courier, which first reported the story. They later expanded it to include a restaurant.\n\nLeBlanc worked there while he was in high school, then returned in 1988 after completing university. In 1994, his parents retired and gave him the keys to the ice cream kingdom.\n\nSince then, he's worked through thick and thin, not even closing for Christmas or Boxing Day \u2014 though he works alone on holidays, and offers a limited menu.\n\n\"Even those days now, there's people that come year after year as part of their Christmas tradition,\" he said.\n\nNot exactly ice cream weather\n\nHe's even worked through the hurricanes and winter storms that have pummelled the East Coast community over the decades.\n\nThis year, he kept the place running during Hurricane Dorian, using a generator to keep the machines humming during the power outage that ensued.\n\nHe remembers one winter day when the weather was so bad he only got one customer \u2014 a man who bought an ice cream cone and soft drink for himself, then returned a few minutes later to grab a beverage for his wife.\n\n\"That was the only customer from until 11:00 in the morning till 10:00 at night,\" he said.\n\nIt's not LeBlanc's first day off. He's taken a few short vacations, he says, and exactly two sick days.\n\n\"If I'm in the area, I am here every day,\" he said. \"I just live next door, 75 feet away, so it's hard to escape.\"\n\nHis staff of eight manned the ship during his previous absences, but he says he always had the store in the back of his mind. This time, though, LeBlanc intends to fully unplug.\n\nHe's already had an anniversary dinner with his parents, so he has Wednesday all to himself.\n\n\"I'm taking my motorcycle out to the Annapolis Valley, and then [in the] night I'm going to be guest starring on a local radio show talking about Area 51,\" he said.\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
