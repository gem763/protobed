The other two are Nissans. The list tops off with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class: 12.4% are resold used within the first year. This is 3.7 times more than the average for all vehicles. On average, 3.4% of new vehicles are resold within the first year of ownership.\n\nThe list also includes a BMW, two Land Rovers, a Mini, two BMWs, two Nissans, and a Jaguar.\n\nRead more: 17 discontinued car brand logos you completely forgot about and will likely never see on the road again\n\nThe firm excluded vehicles with less than 1,000 miles on the odometer from the study. This was done to keep the study from being skewed by \u201ccar punching\u201d, which is when automakers offer incentives to dealers to buy new cars to use as loaners and then resell them when they\u2019re still under a year old.\n\nCheck out the list of the most commonly resold cars within the first year of ownership:\n\n10. Nissan Versa\n\nsource Courtesy Nissan\n\nThe sedan and hatchback version of the Nissan Versa both made the list.\n\nThe data says 8.7% of Nissan Versas were resold as \u201cused\u201d within the first year.\n\n9. Jaguar XF\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\n\u201cJaguar is notorious for having high operating costs, which may cause new car owners to give up their cars soon after purchase,\u201d iSeeCars CEO Phong Ly said in a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, the automaker has fought to improve that perception by recently decreasing prices and adding free scheduled maintenance for new cars.\u201d\n\nThe data says 8.8% of Jaguar XFs were resold.\n\n8. Nissan Versa Note\n\nsource Nissan Media\n\nThe second Nissan Versa on the list is the hatchback Note version. The data says 9% of the Notes were resold.\n\n7. BMW X3\n\nsource BMW\n\n\u201cDespite the popularity of the [BMW X3 and X1], they generally have below-average reliability ratings from Consumer Reports, which could contribute to why owners get rid of them so quickly,\u201d Ly said.\n\nLike the Nissan Versa Note, 9% of the BMW X3s were resold.\n\n6. BMW X1\n\nsource BMW\n\n\u201cAnother possible explanation is that BMW and Mercedes offer incentives to their dealers to buy new cars to use as loaner vehicles, which are then sold as used when they are still under a year old,\u201d Ly continued.\n\n\u201cIn turn, this boosts the brand\u2019s new car sales and introduces current customers to new models when they bring in their vehicles for service.\u201d\n\nThe data says 10.4% of the X1s were resold.\n\n5. Mini Clubman\n\nsource Courtesy of MINI\n\nThe Mini Clubman is the most expensive car on the list. Its price, in conjunction with its low fuel-economy rating, may have caused drivers to want to trade it in for something more efficient, Ly said.\n\nThe data says 10.7% of the cars purchased were resold.\n\n4. Land Rover Range Rover Evoque\n\nsource Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThe data says 10.9% of the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque models sold were resold.\n\n3. Land Rover Discovery Sport\n\nsource Land Rover\n\n\u201cThe Discovery Sport and the Range Rover Evoque each have poor projected reliability ratings from J.D. Power, which could contribute to why owners would want to give them up,\u201d Ly said.\n\nThe data says 11.8% of the Discovery Sport units sold were resold.\n\n2. BMW 3 Series\n\nsource BMW\n\nThe data says 11.8% of the 3 Series sold were resold.\n\n1. Mercedes-Benz C-Class\n\nsource Mercedes Benz\n\nThe most resold car, 12.4% of these Mercedes were resold used within the first year.
