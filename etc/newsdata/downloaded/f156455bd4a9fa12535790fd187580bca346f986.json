I know he trusts me a lot because I\u2019ve started all the games in the Premier League since the start of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s then up to me to stay myself, play well and repay that trust. He\u2019s the one who gave me the opportunity at the highest level.\n\n\u201cI already played a lot last year. He gives me a lot of confidence and he\u2019s the one who makes me feel good on the pitch.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also my teammates, who are a big part of that, but he\u2019s really, really made me progress since I arrived at Arsenal.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nFormer Gunners striker Wright last week praised Guendouzi for \"taking the game by the scruff of the neck and driving Arsenal forward\".\n\n\"I know they've chosen the captain but Xhaka should not be captain in front of this guy (Guendouzi) or Aubameyang, for me,\" Wright told Premier League productions.\n\n\"Guendouzi is leading by example for a 20-year-old. We know Tony Adams was a captain at 20. Maybe Unai's not strong enough to give somebody like Matteo Guendouzi [the captaincy].\n\n\"When you look at him here and what he's doing, that is taking the game by the scruff of the neck and driving Arsenal forward, and he's not been made captain or vice-captain. It's crazy, for me.\"", "description": "French U21 ace has been one of Gunners' most consistent performers and says that's down to the manager", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19468164.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
