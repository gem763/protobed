The British plan had been to have customs checks \u2018away from either side of the border\u2019 but this was dismissed by critics as \u2018vague\u2019.\n\nThe original plan would have given the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote every four years on the new arrangements.\n\nDublin said this was effectively handing a near permanent veto to the Democratic Unionists at Stormont.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nMr Johnson met Irish premier Leo Varadkar in Merseyside on Thursday with little hope of progress. But after three hours of talks they both agreed on a \u2018pathway to a possible deal\u2019.\n\nWhat they agreed is not yet fully known. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay put an outline to the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday in a meeting described as \u2018constructive\u2019.\n\nHow the journey of a fridge explains how the deal may just work\n\nWill it solve customs issue?\n\nSources claimed yesterday that Mr Johnson has agreed to effectively scrap any customs border between NI and the Republic \u2013 and replace it with a scheme under which the province will be in both the EU and the UK customs zones simultaneously.\n\nCustoms checks would take place at a new administrative border on the Irish Sea, with firms paying EU tariffs on goods travelling from the British mainland to Northern Ireland.\n\nIt would mean the UK would collect tariffs on goods on behalf of the EU. Goods to Ireland will then be free to travel there without any stop at the border. If the goods are destined for NI, firms could claim a rebate to take into account a potentially lower UK tariff.\n\nThe single market?\n\nNI would stay \u2018aligned\u2019 to the EU\u2019s rules and regulations. Checks would take place when goods are travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, obviating the need for checks between Ulster and the Republic.\n\nSounds familiar?\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s plan has its roots in the \u2018customs partnership\u2019 once championed by Theresa May. This also would have seen NI effectively remain in the customs union but still able to take advantage of UK trade deals.\n\nLast year, Mr Johnson described the idea as a \u2018crazy system whereby you end up collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier\u2019 \u2013 exactly what he is now proposing. The EU also rejected the idea.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s plan relates only to Northern Ireland, while Mrs May\u2019s took in the whole UK. This reduces the level of bureaucracy as the trade between the mainland and Ulster is clearly lower than the huge volumes flowing into ports such as Felixstowe and Dover.\n\nMr Johnson met Irish premier Leo Varadkar in Merseyside on Thursday with little hope of progress. But after three hours of talks they both agreed on a \u2018pathway to a possible deal\u2019 (pictured together after the meeting)\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay put an outline to the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday in a meeting described as \u2018constructive\u2019 (pictured together on Friday)\n\nAnd Stormont?\n\nMr Johnson is understood to have dropped the four-yearly Stormont votes plan. Some form of democratic \u2018consent\u2019 is likely if only to honour the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe other 27 EU members yesterday agreed to open intensive \u2018tunnel\u2019 negotiations on the latest proposals.Accelerated negotiations will take place over the weekend and could be wrapped up by Wednesday. If a deal is thrashed out in Brussels then it could be put to a vote in Westminster next Saturday, October 19.\n\nWill MPs buy it?\n\nHe\u2019s largely given up on the bulk of Labour MPs who are determined to stop a \u2018Tory Brexit\u2019 at all costs. The Lib Dems and the SNP will also vote against. No 10 will spend the week convincing Tory Remainers who were thrown out to now climb back on board. However, the chances of a deal being rubberstamped remain slim.", "description": "Mr Johnson met Irish premier Leo Varadkar in Merseyside on Thursday with little hope of progress.
