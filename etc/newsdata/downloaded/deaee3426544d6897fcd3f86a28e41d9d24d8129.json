For months, current and former Trump-administration officials whom they had called as public witnesses in their investigation of the president had refused to comply with subpoenas at the demand of the White House. Those included Rick Dearborn, a former deputy chief of staff, and Rob Porter, the former staff secretary, who had been called to testify alongside Lewandowski today.\n\nLewandowski, however, had never served in the Trump administration, so the White House\u2019s ability to block his testimony was more limited. Still, on the eve of his appearance, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone informed Nadler that he was instructing Lewandowski not to talk about anything that was not already covered in the public Mueller report.\n\nThe demand infuriated Democrats, but their options to contest it were limited, partly by their own choosing. They are challenging the Trump administration\u2019s assertions of executive privilege and refusal to comply with subpoenas in court, but that legal process could drag out for months. The party\u2019s other recourse is impeaching Trump for obstructing Congress, but even though the Judiciary Committee is now formally investigating whether to recommend articles of impeachment, the Democratic leadership is reluctant to move more quickly or aggressively toward a vote. Republicans, both in Congress and in the White House, know this and are taking advantage.\n\nRead: The question Democrats have to answer before they can impeach\n\nLewandowski had given Democrats a preview of his tone during the hearing on Twitter, when he tweeted early this morning that he was \u201cexcited about the opportunity to remind the American people today there was no collusion [and] no obstruction.\u201d In his opening statement, he adopted Trump\u2019s talking points about the \u201cfake Russian collusion\u201d narrative and criticized \u201cTrump haters\u201d bent on taking down a duly elected president. At one point, he said that as Trump\u2019s campaign manager, he received hundreds of thousands of emails. \u201cUnlike Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t think I ever deleted any of those,\u201d Lewandowski joked.\n\nWhen Nadler began his questioning by simply asking Lewandowski whether, as stated in the Mueller report, he had met with Trump in the Oval Office in July 2017, Lewandowski made clear that he was going to follow Cipollone\u2019s instruction to a T. Before answering the question, he demanded that Nadler furnish him with a physical copy of the Mueller report and a precise citation he could reference.\n\nTo prevent Lewandowski from running out Nadler\u2019s five minutes of allotted question time, the chairman ordered the clerk to stop the clock, which drew protests from Republicans, who demanded that he had to restart it. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t when he is filibustering me,\u201d an exasperated Nadler replied.", "description": "At his recent hearing, the president\u2019s former campaign manager had a much larger audience in mind than just congressional Democrats.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX73CUY/facebook.jpg?1568754298", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
