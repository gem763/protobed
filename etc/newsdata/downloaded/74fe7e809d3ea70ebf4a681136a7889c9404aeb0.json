On Tuesday, the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee released a sobering report warning of fresh signs of interference by Russia and other foreign nations in the 2020 election.\n\nThe company\u2019s position stands in contrast to CNN, which rejected two ads from the Trump campaign last week, including the one the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down. The cable channel said it rejected the ad because it \u201cmakes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been dogged by accusations of censorship by conservative politicians, including Mr Trump, who argue that the Silicon Valley company gives greater attention to liberal points of views on the social network.\n\nBut by removing itself as the moderator of political content \u2014 including in paid ads on the site \u2014 Facebook has left itself open another avenue of criticism. In a series of tweets Monday evening, senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination, said Facebook allowed Trump to spread false information widely and called on the company to take down the attack ad against Mr Biden, one of her top rivals.\n\n\u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy \u2014 allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections,\u201d Ms Warren wrote.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He said he had held back financial aid to push the country to make reforms.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr Biden, during his time as vice president, pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor general to help his son Hunter Biden. The former vice president, along with other members of the Obama administration and other international leaders, pushed for the removal of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because of accusations that he ignored corruption.\n\nDays after the ad was broadcast on television and social networks the Biden campaign wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, asking to reject the ad. The video \u201cspreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories regarding vice president Joe Biden,\u201d Greg Schultz, a Biden campaign manager, wrote to the Facebook leaders.\n\nSchultz wrote that the vice president\u2019s call for a new prosecutor in Ukraine\u2019s investigation of a company was supported by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He included clippings from The Washington Post and Factcheck.org that debunked the claims of Mr Biden\u2019s motives of squashing the investigation to benefit his son.\n\nAfter CNN rejected the ad last week, Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Trump\u2019s campaign, said that the ad was \u201centirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cCNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming,\u201d Mr Murtaugh wrote in a statement. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re shielding him from truthful advertising, too.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign also urged Fox News to reject the Trump campaign ad last week. But the cable channel declined to do so, saying that it was \u201cnot in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nThe ad has also appeared on YouTube and Twitter. A spokesman for Twitter said Tuesday that the ad complied with its policies. A YouTube official likewise said the ad complied with its policies.\n\nTJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr Biden, wrote in an email that \u201cDonald Trump has demonstrated he will continue to subvert our democratic institutions for his own personal gain, but his shortcomings are no excuse for companies like Facebook to refuse to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The 30-second video ad released by the Trump campaign last week is grainy, and the narrator\u2019s voice is foreboding.
