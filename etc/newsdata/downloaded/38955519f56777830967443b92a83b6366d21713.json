Kinzinger", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump sent out a barrage of tweets over the weekend defending his \u201cperfect\u201d phone call with the president of Ukraine and trying to shut down the House impeachment inquiry before it gets underway \u2014 including passing along a warning that removing him from office would lead to \u201ca Civil War like fracture,\u201d a threat that a Republican congressman called \u201cbeyond repugnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\u201d Trump tweeted, adding his own parenthetical to a quote from Robert Jeffress, an evangelical pastor and ardent Trump supporter who appeared on \u201cFox & Friends Weekend.\u201d\n\nThe invocation of a civil war was met with outrage from Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war,\u201d Kinzinger tweeted, tagging Trump\u2019s Twitter handle. \u201cI have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nTrump, though, did not seem interested in toning down the rhetoric.\n\nPresident Trump and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. (Photos: Carolyn Kaster/AP, Jacquelyn Martin/AP) More\n\nShortly before quoting Jeffress, Trump fired off a series of tweets attacking House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who during a congressional hearing last week paraphrased the White House memo summarizing Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The memo was part of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against the president, which led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\u201cLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u2018Whistleblower,\u2019 represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThen Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress.\n\n\u201cHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber,\u201d the president continued. \u201cHe wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\u201d\n\nIn his opening remarks at a committee hearing Thursday, Schiff paraphrased Trump\u2019s message to Zelensky on the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked for help in finding dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. Schiff didn\u2019t claim to be quoting Trump directly and later described the remarks as part parody.\n\nOn Monday morning, Trump\u2019s suggestion that Schiff be \u201cquestioned\u201d for treason was escalated to the suggestion he be arrested.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIt bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Rep.
