Williams is currently in the fourth year of a five-year contract extension he signed in 2015; had he held out for the entire season, his contract would have tolled and he still would have had two years remaining.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA seven-time Pro Bowler, Williams will immediately improve the Washington offensive line if he\u2019s in game shape and plays.\n\nHe has stayed away from the team for months, largely because he\u2019s unhappy with Washington\u2019s medical staff.\n\nIn August there were multiple reports that Williams would not play for Washington again \u201cperiod,\u201d and that the reasons were deeper than money.\n\nWilliams\u2019 mistrust of the organization and training staff revolve around a situation earlier this year, when Williams found a growth on his head that scared him. Williams believes medical staff mishandled things. He has since had the growth removed and it was found to be benign.\n\nTeam president Bruce Allen reportedly had discussions with two teams about trading Williams over the final 24 hours before the trade deadline, notably the Cleveland Browns, but his asking price was reportedly too high. NFL Network said Allen wasn\u2019t just looking for draft picks, but a player like Browns corner Denzel Ward.\n\nHe's back: Trent Williams ended his holdout on Tuesday.
