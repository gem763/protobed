Mr Turnbull is going to extraordinary long lengths to stop Australians finding out the truth about the cost of the NBN (National Broadband Network),\u201d said Labor leader Bill Shorten.\n\n\u201cHe is going after whistleblowers and he is smearing his political opponents. The public have a right to know the truth and whistleblowers have a right to protection.\u201d\n\nTurnbull said that he had no prior notice of the raids and chastised Labor for questioning the integrity of police.\n\n\u201cThe first I heard of the AFP investigation was yesterday when I was advised by the Justice Minister shortly after he\u2019d been advised by the Commissioner,\u201d he told reporter.\n\nTurnbull was communications minister for more than two years before deposing Tony Abbott in a party coup last year. He drew criticism for his decision to scale back the A$38 billion broadband programme, stopping short of connecting homes directly to the network amid cost overruns.\n\nNBN aims to connect 93 percent of Australian homes and workplaces with optical fibre, providing broadband services in urban and regional areas. It was created in 2009 by the Australian government and is expected to be ready by 2020.\n\nThe AFP said in a statement that it had informed both the government and opposition before conducting the raids, as is standard procedure.\n\n\u201cIn regard to government and political influence that has been commented on this morning, there has been no influence, no influence on the AFP in the conduct of this investigation,\u201d AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin told reporters.\n\nUniversity of Sydney Emeritus Professor of Political Science and the Media, Rod Tiffen, said that the raids, coming as they have in the midst of a federal election campaign, were \u201cunprecedented\u201d and that it was unclear how it would play out.\n\n\u201cWe, it\u2019s certainly extraordinary. I\u2019ve never know anything at all like it in an election campaign,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s really the key question: whether it was politically motivated in some sense.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "Australia\u2019s election campaign was hijacked on Friday by police raids on the Labor opposition, over a suspected leak of documents citing cost blow-outs in a multi-billion dollar broadband upgrade, spar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/333221/1000x563_333221.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-20"}
