American forces must realise (they) will never win the war by killing innocent civilians,\u201d said Javed Mansur, a resident of Jalalabad city.\n\nScores of local men joined a protest against the attack on Thursday morning as they helped carry the victims\u2019 bodies to Jalalabad city and then to the burial site.\n\nMen carry a coffin of one of the victims after a drone strike, in Khogyani district of Nangarhar province, Afghanistan September 19, 2019.REUTERS/Parwiz\n\nAttaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor said the aerial attack was meant to target IS militants who often use farmlands for training and recruitment purposes, but had hit innocent civilians.\n\nJihadist IS fighters first appeared in Afghanistan in 2014 and have since made inroads in the east and north where they are battling the government, U.S. forces and the Taliban.\n\nThe exact number of IS fighters is difficult to calculate because they frequently switch allegiances, but the U.S. military estimates there are about 2,000.\n\nThere was no word from IS on the attack.\n\nThere has been no let-up in assaults by Taliban and IS as Afghanistan prepares for a presidential election this month.\n\nIn a separate incident, at least 20 people died in a suicide truck bomb attack on Thursday carried out by the Taliban in the southern province of Zabul.\n\nHundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting across Afghanistan after the collapse of U.S.-Taliban peace talks this month. The Taliban has warned U.S. President Donald Trump will regret his decision to abruptly call off talks that could have led to a political settlement to end the 18-year-old war.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe United Nations says nearly 4,000 civilians were killed or wounded in the first half of the year. That included a big increase in casualties inflicted by government and U.S.-led foreign forces.\n\n(For a graphic on Afghan civilian casualties, click here)", "description": "A U.S. drone strike intended to hit an Islamic State (IS) hideout in Afghanistan killed at least 30 civilians resting after a day's labour in the fields, officials said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Ahmad Sultan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431666002&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I172", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
