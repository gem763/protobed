You want to find a nice balance between acidity, sweetness, sourness, and fat,' Davide told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nAccording to Sydney's top Italian chef Davide Incardona (pictured), you are much better off pairing flavours, rather than colours, to get the most out of your culinary experience\n\nWhich wine glass should be used when drinking which wine? This is a basic rule to follow: Red wine: Larger glass with a fuller body White wine: Skinnier glass with a smaller body Champagne/sparkling wine: Flute\n\nPairing white wine with fish only\n\nOne of the common mistakes foodies make is pairing white wine with fish only.\n\n'This is a common mistake people make based on a \"general\" rule they heard from someone,' Davide said.\n\n'The next time you have Italian or Mediterranean cuisine with plenty of herbs spices or tomatoes cooked with fish, try a light Pinot Noir or Etna Rosso. I promise you this will help enhance the flavour.'\n\nServing champagne with dessert\n\nDavide said you should never drink champagne with dessert because you'll end up with an unusual taste.\n\n'The sweetness of a dessert only highlights the acidity of champagne or sparkling wines,' he explained.\n\n'If you have only ever tried champagne in this way, then that could be the reason you might not like it.'\n\nDavide said foodies should try a light Pinot Noir or Etna Rosso with fish instead of white wine\n\nThe executive chef creates his menus at Barangaroo's Corso Brio - an in-house fine dining restaurant inside Bel & Brio (pictured)\n\nWho is Davide Incardona? Born and raised in the northern Italian city of Brescia, chef Davide Incardona's wealth of culinary experience is attributed to his traditional Italian upbringing. Having observed his family pour love and passion into cooking from a young age has shaped how Incardona creates his menus at Bel & Brio. 'Our focus is to bring something hearty to the table with its own individual character that nourishes all senses. We want to make sure our guests feel like they are in Italy and savour every bite,' he said. Bel & Brio has launched a new in-house fine dining restaurant Corso Brio.\n\nSelecting wines based on 'common' knowledge\n\nMost wine drinkers believe that red wine should be paired with meat such as beef and whites couple well with fish like barramundi or cod - but this isn't always the case.\n\n'When I say this, I mean that most people simply select wines based on the thinking that red wine goes with meat, white with fish and prosecco with starter dishes,' Davide said.\n\n'There are so many wines to choose from that, unfortunately, it's not that simple. Think about the structure of the wine and of the dish, including the fats, acid, sweetness, and texture that might be in the dish.\n\n'It can be confusing so the best way to select a good wine with your meal is to ask your restaurant sommelier or local wine expert.'\n\nPairing oysters with Barossa Shiraz\n\n'The freshness of the oyster and the structure of this full-bodied red wine will never complement one another,' Davide warned.\n\nAs experts and sommeliers will know, there are rules and etiquette surrounding the process of pairing food dishes with wine\n\nNot asking for help\n\nThis may be an obvious one but foodies always tend to avoid asking questions.\n\n'The sommelier at the restaurant you are dining at or the wine connoisseur at your local wine store is there to help you and answer all of your questions, even if you think they are silly,' Davide said.\n\n'Pairing wine and food is not simple - and a beautiful dinner can easily be ruined by choosing the wrong choice of wine. Sommeliers are passionate about wine and they are more than happy to make sure you pick the right one.'", "description": "Sydney's top Italian chef\u00a0Davide Incardona has shared the common mistakes you're making when pairing food - and how to correctly decant wine.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19467722-0-image-a-204_1570577792673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
