It was one of the austerity measures introduced by the government to meet the conditions of $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe president also offered the protest leaders to begin talks to settle the crisis and they accepted the invitation.\n\nOne of the conditions was that the talks be held in public and be broadcast live. \"We're not going to talk behind closed doors. It has to be with the Ecuadorian people,\" one of the protest leaders said.\n\nBut besides proposing dialogue, Moreno also announced that he\u2019s introducing a curfew and \u201cmilitarization\u201d of Quito, starting 8pm GMT. \u201cThis will facilitate the use of public force in the face of intolerable excess of violence,\u201d he said on Twitter. Ecuador's armed forces also announced late on Saturday that the movements around the country would be restricted for 24 hours.\n\nFootage from Quito on Saturday resembled a war zone, with barricades, fires and plumes of tear gas fired by the police at the raging crowds.\n\nLive feed by RT\u2019s video agency Ruptly showed thick smoke in the air and crowds of people rioting, as sounds of explosions frequently rocked the streets.\n\nChaotic scenes come in from #Ecuador\u2019s #Quito, where protesters took to streets en masse over President Len\u00edn #Moreno\u2019s unpopular austerity policies\n\n\n\nMORE: https://t.co/WybcFX7haxpic.twitter.com/IHLP8zZ83I \u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 12, 2019\n\nThe protesters, mainly represented by Ecuador\u2019s indigenous people, set the Comptroller General's Office on fire and ravaged the parliament building, breaking windows and throwing furniture into the street. The demonstrators also blocked all roads leading to Quito International Airport.\n\nThe administrative buildings taken over by the protesters were empty, as Moreno had already moved the government to the city of Guayaquil, located 250 kilometers south-west of Quito.\n\nIt was the capital's tenth straight day of unrest, which broke out after the government announced austerity measures as part of a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe suspension on fuel subsidies saw the price of gasoline spiking from $1.85 to $2.39 per gallon, while diesel prices went up by a staggering 123 per cent \u2013 from $1.03 to $2.29.\n\nFive people have been killed and over 1,000 wounded in clashes since October 3, according to government data. The police have arrested over 1,100 demonstrators.\n\nMoreno was previously reluctant to reconsider the harsh measures and blamed former president, Rafael Correa, and his ally Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, of masterminding the demonstrations.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Absolute chaos' as thousands protest in Ecuador's capital, braving tear gas and clashes with police\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
