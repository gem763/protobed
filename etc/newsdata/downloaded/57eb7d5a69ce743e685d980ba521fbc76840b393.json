In particular, Save Yourself only uses 50 percent of the infected machine\u2019s CPU to mine Monero, so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nThe malware can also reportedly read clipboard data and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses with its own, presumably to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to the attackers.\n\nSave Yourself is also said to compromise any executable found on the target machine to ensure automatic infection any time the user runs such files.\n\n\u201cThe desired executable will then run as it should, so the user won\u2019t suspect that there\u2019s anything wrong,\u201d said Reason. \u201cNor will anything look suspicious when analysing the sample since \u2013 at first glance, it will look like known software (icon, signature, strings, functionality).\u201d\n\nThe firm noted that most anti-virus solutions should detect and clear the malware. As well, major email providers are automatically protecting users against the sextortion emails.\n\nHard Fork previously reported, though, that the attackers are pivoting, now demanding Litecoin instead of Bitcoin so as to dodge email filters.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
