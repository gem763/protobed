This was chance to see the future of the NBA for the first time \u2014 not counting his brief stint in the Las Vegas Summer League \u2014 and Williamson did not disappoint, though he's not close to being a finished product after just one college season at Duke.\n\nJust 62 seconds into the game, he took a pass from Lonzo Ball on the pick-and-roll and banked one in while drawing the foul from John Collins. Williamson knocked down the free throw and \u2014 voila \u2014 he had his first three-point play. A small section of the crowd chanted \"Overrated!\" but their hearts weren't really in it.\n\nWilliamson was still listed at 6-foot-7 on the Pelicans roster, though he reportedly measured an inch shorter without shoes as part of the league's push to accurately measure everyone in the league this season.\n\nWhatever the case, he turned Hawks 7-footer Damian Jones into the first of what will likely be an abundance of poster victims with his next basket.\n\nSizing up the Hawks from beyond the 3-point arc, Williamson suddenly burst toward the hoop, split a pair of defenders and dunked over the taller Jones with a fearsome right hand that left the fans gasping.\n\nA couple of minutes later, Williamson delivered a two-handed slam off another pass from Ball, a tantalizing display from the young duo. In the second quarter, it was a left-handed dunk set up by a dish from Kenrich Williams as the Hawks defense wisely scrambled out of the way.\n\nBefore the game, the past and future came together.\n\nWilliamson lingered at midcourt during warmups, clearly eager for a chance to pay his respects to the NBA's senior citizen. Atlanta's 42-year-old Vince Carter, preparing for his record 22nd \u2014 and final \u2014 season, came over to say a few words to the 19-year-old phenom, pulling him in close to make sure he could hear it all.\n\nAfter the introductions and the national anthem, Williamson took the court with his new team, a franchise that was rocked by Anthony Davis' trade demand but quickly recovered by landing the first overall pick in the draft lottery.\n\nDavis was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers for a haul that included Ball and Brandon Ingram \u2014 both of whom joined the teenager in a Pelicans starting lineup that also included Jrue Holiday and Derrick Favors.\n\nThe rebuilding teams featured four of the top 10 picks in this year's draft.\n\nThe Hawks sent out No. 5 pick De'Andre Hunter as part of their starting lineup, and brought 10th selection Cam Reddish off the bench. The Pelicans also have No. 8 choice Jaxson Hayes, though he didn't play in the first half.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
