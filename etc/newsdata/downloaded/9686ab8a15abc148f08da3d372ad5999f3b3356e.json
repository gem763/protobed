However headline earnings on a comparable basis decreased by 9.7% due to exceptional and one-off items in 2017 and 2018, including selling the Captain DoRegos business.\n\nRevenue from the group\u2019s continuing operations, meanwhile, increased by 3% to R667.2m.\n\nSteak Ranches, which accounts for two-third\u2019s of the group\u2019s sales, was damaged due to a controversial consumer boycott in the wake of an angry exchange between two customers posted on social media in March 2017.\n\nThe exchange, between a white man and a black woman, sparked nationwide outrage at the time. Spur took the decision to ban the man from all Spur restaurants, but this was met with considerable backlash.\n\nA Facebook page called \u2018Boycott/Boikot SPUR Steak Ranches\u2019 was set up shortly after this decision, describing Spur as biased for not also taking action against the woman.\n\nWhile sales dipped by 9.1% in the first half of the financial year, and by 3.2% in the third quarter, they rose by 14.8% in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis resulted in a net decrease of 2.8% in sales for the full year. Franchise revenue declined by 3.2%\n\nThe group's CEO Pierre van Tonder said increased sales in the second half of the year were due to an improved focus on product quality, service and innovation, rather than an improvement in consumer spending.\n\n\n\n\u201cDiscretionary spend is under growing pressure which is resulting in a continuing decline in restaurant and shopping centre foot traffic. However, the improving sales in the last six months is positive for the sales outlook as we move into the new financial year,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall franchised restaurant sales in South Africa, meanwhile, grew by 1.5% year-on-year.\n\n\n\nInternational restaurant sales - excluding the Captain DoRegos chain which was sold off in March \u2013 increased by 2.7% on a constant exchange rate basis and declined by 0.7% in rand terms, the corporation said.\n\n\n\nThe group also announced a total dividend of 123 cents per share for 2018, down 6.8% than in 2017.\n\nIt added it had been negatively impacted by fee concessions granted to \u201cassist several franchisees in the aftermath of the Spur social media incident\u201d, but the level of financial assistance has steadily reduced.\n\n* Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER", "description": "The restaurant franchise chain posted strong growth in the fourth quarter of the financial year, but the group\u2019s flagship brand still ended with lower sales than in 2017 due to a controversial consumer boycott.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2992/a0d5b3f933db4a61a6d05b35dcc7bfbd.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-06"}
