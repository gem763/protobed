There have been more requests in 2019 so far than at the same point in any of the previous five years.\n\nIn 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 75 adoptions in Hong Kong, a number comparable to previous years. The Hong Kong government estimates that last year about 7,600 people left the city for good, roughly one-third the number who sought police-record printouts.\n\nAuthorities in Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan have reported spikes in migration enquiries, and property agents from Melbourne to Vancouver say their phones are running hot.\n\n\"There are many uncertainties in Hong Kong,\" one investor on a property agent's late-August tour of suburban Melbourne said before, laying out A$600,000 ($410,000) for a house-and-land package.\n\n\"People like me in their 40s and 50s - we think about our child,\" said the investor, who gave only her family name, Lee, because her employer forbids speaking to the media.\n\n\"We want a back-up home, a better place to live,\" she added. \"At least if something bad happens, they have a back-up plan, an exit plan.\"\n\nAnd she is not alone: Lee's sentiments were echoed in interviews with 10 other families or individuals considering emigrating.\n\nChina has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and the Hong Kong government has sought to head off further trouble by accepting one of the protesters' demands and withdrawing the extradition bill.\n\nA mass march scheduled for Sunday will test how far that has allayed public anger.\n\n\n\n\n\nPASSPORT PLEASE\n\nAs Hong Kong's protests have expanded during the summer, swelling to million-strong marches and calls for democracy, so too have Hong Kongers' searches for safe havens.\n\nIn June, lawyers and bankers told Reuters that wealthy tycoons were shifting their fortunes to places like Singapore.\n\nNow, migration agents say, middle-class families are checking out cheaper alternatives.\n\n\"The numbers are the highest in recent years, even higher than 2014,\" said Peggy Lau, a sales director at Uni Immigration Consultancy in Hong Kong, where enquiries have surged sevenfold since protests began in June.\n\nTo be sure, there is no official data tracking emigration applications from Hong Kong, which has a population of about 7 million. Nor is there evidence of departures or cash outflows on the scale of those in the aftermath of the 1997 handover from Britain to China.\n\nBut there are firm signs of preparations.\n\nFavored destinations such as Malaysia, which is relatively cheap, and Taiwan, which is culturally similar to Hong Kong, show sharp rises in interest.\n\nAt Johor, near Malaysia's southern tip, property consultant Bruce Lee said Hong Kongers have poured into a project called Forest City, developed by China's Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd <2007.HK>, buying 800 units since June.\n\nThat compares with 200 units purchased between then and 2016, when sales began.\n\nThe number of visas issued to Hong Kongers in Taiwan in June and July was 38% higher, at 884, than in the same period a year ago, according to the island's Ministry of the Interior National Immigration Agency.\n\nEnquiries by Hong Kongers at Immigration@SG LLP, an immigration consultancy in Singapore, rose by roughly a quarter in the past two months compared with earlier in the year, said a company spokesman, Muhammad Ryhan.\n\nState authorities in Australia have noted a \"significant\" increase in visa enquiries from Hong Kong, but declined to give details. Immigration agents have said there is also growing interest in Canada, the U.S. and Ireland.", "description": "HONG KONG/MELBOURNE/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - As protests in Hong Kong stretch from summer into autumn with little sign of resolution, a surge in migration applications suggests more locals are making plans to leave the special administrative region.
