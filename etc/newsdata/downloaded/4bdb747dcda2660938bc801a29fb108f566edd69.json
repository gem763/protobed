(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nUber and Lyft are floating a new proposal to pay drivers a $21 minimum wage. It may not add up.\n\nThe ride-hailing giants are floating the new wage and benefits as the California State Senate is set to vote on a bill that could convert contracted workers into employees, a worker classification fiercely opposed by Uber and Lyft because of the associated costs and liability.\n\nTo convince legislators, and drivers, that the move is unnecessary, Uber and Lyft have proposed a $21 hourly \u201con-trip\u201d minimum wage. Workers also would have access to \u201cportable benefits,\u201d such as sick leave and workers\u2019 compensation. Uber and Lyft have asked drivers to lobby for an alternative.\n\nThose who study ride hailing say the wage proposed by the companies would amount to about $15 at most, because it excludes the time it takes for drivers to return from a drop-off and wait for another trip. Drivers typically spend about 30 to 40 percent of their time without a passenger, and roughly 10 percent is spent driving to pick up a passenger, according to studies. The pick-up period would be compensated.\n\n[Internal data shows Uber\u2019s reputation hasn\u2019t changed much since #DeleteUber]\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a retail store and there\u2019s nobody in the store several hours a day, you still pay for that time,\u201d said Michael Reich, co-chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nTransportation consultant Bruce Schaller, who has studied ride-hailing\u2019s effects on traffic in major metropolitan areas, said Uber and Lyft\u2019s proposal discounts a significant amount of drivers\u2019 work. \u201cThe companies couldn\u2019t operate if drivers weren\u2019t available,\u201d he said.\n\nUber argued that data shows its new minimum hourly wage would apply to just below 75 percent of the miles driven by its contractors.\n\nUber and Lyft have created thousands of jobs as part of the gig economy, a system that includes everything from putting together Ikea furniture to waiting in line for theater tickets. Most of those jobs are for contract workers, which helps limit liability \u2014 and wages \u2014 for companies organizing the assignments.\n\nBut as these companies grow and go public, many of the workers are clamoring for better rights and pay. California is one of the first states to consider legislation that would require gig workers to be treated as employees by law. That\u2019s significant, because California\u2019s legislation often influences other states, as it has with its tech privacy law, for example.\n\nAdvocates say it could help transform the gig economy nationwide so that drivers who have long advocated for steady pay and benefits could secure the rights that come with employment. Uber and Lyft didn\u2019t say how their alternative wage floor would impact their bottom line, but Lyft pointed to data that showed most drivers already earn well above that floor in major markets \u2014 so the baseline would account largely for outliers.\n\n[New rules guarantee minimum wage for NYC Uber, Lyft drivers]\n\nThe bill advanced out of the Senate\u2019s labor committee in July and advanced out of an appropriations vote Friday ahead of a legislative session deadline on Sept. 13. It has garnered the support of prominent Democrats, including Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg this week, and could lay the groundwork for ride-share drivers to secure rights long sought by labor groups.\n\nKnown as AB5, the bill would establish a wage floor for certain categories of workers equal to two times the state minimum wage, which is $12 statewide and higher locally, for hours worked. It also would give workers legal protections that come with employee status, such as the right to overtime and provisions against sexual and workplace harassment. It is unknown whether the bill, which would be considered a precedent-setting measure, would apply to some or all workers in the gig economy.\n\nTony West, general counsel for Uber, said in an interview Friday that the company\u2019s proposal still brings the wage floor above the minimum wage while covering expenses such as wear and tear. \u201cLabor has been fighting for $15 for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd $15 is much higher than the minimum wage in most places, including California.\u201d\n\nWest added that Uber is also pushing for sectoral bargaining, a framework advocated by labor groups in which gig economy workers could bargain as a unit without company unionization. That would allow drivers or food-delivery couriers to bargain with all of the companies they serve, limiting cost differences.\n\nUber and Lyft have each committed $30 million for a 2020 ballot initiative on gig work in case the bill passes. Food-delivery service DoorDash also committed $30 million to fight the legislation in 2020.\n\nLyft spokesman Adrian Durbin said it remains to be seen what the ballot initiative would entail, but the companies hoped to avoid reaching to that point with a compromise.\n\nMostafa Maklad has driven for both Uber and Lyft in the Bay Area for a few years. He supports the bill, and says the companies\u2019 messaging has been misleading, driving a wedge between older drivers who have seen how the companies operate and newer drivers.\n\n\u201cMost of them don\u2019t even see how many hours they have to drive and how much time they have to spend waiting to get another ride and how much money they\u2019re spending on gas and mileage and depreciation on the car,\" said Maklad.", "description": "The Calif. state senate faces a deadline Friday to advance AB5, which could give employment rights to hundreds of thousands of gig workers.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber", "Faiz Siddiqui Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Technology Team.
