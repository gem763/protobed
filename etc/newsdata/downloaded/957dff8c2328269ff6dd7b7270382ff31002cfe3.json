She claims the 53-year-old Italian businessman allowed her home to be advertised on Airbnb in a money-making scheme, pocketing tens of thousands of pounds.\n\nMrs Boisragon, who is in her 70s, also accuses Mr Grasso of not paying any rent for more than a year. Ironically, on one occasion she was arrested after challenging Mr Grasso.\n\nMin Boisragon (pictured) began renting out her \u00a31.5 million property in Chelsea, West London, to Francesco Grasso in March 2017\n\nWhen confronted with the Airbnb claims in court, Mr Grasso called on a witness who said he was merely 'allowing his relatives and close family members from the US to stay with him on an occasional temporary basis'.\n\nDespite the courts issuing a warrant for his eviction in January this year, Mr Grasso moved his possessions out of the property only two weeks ago.\n\nAnd the costly legal action is still ongoing because Mr Grasso has appealed against his eviction.\n\nMrs Boisragon said: 'It's been a living nightmare. I had to sit and wait for the courts for months and months.\n\nThe \u00a31.5 million property (pictured from the outside) in Chelsea, West London, was rented out in 2017\n\n'When he puts in an appeal, it's another six, seven months. That's how it goes on. The very last thing he can try is to take me to court to get a face-to-face hearing. It's cost me thousands in solicitors' bills. I don't know if I can take any more.\n\n'The place is in a state. We can't move upstairs because even in single rooms, he has put in double beds. He's got a washing machine and a TV in every room.'\n\nItalian business man Francesco Grasso, 53, (pictured) is accused of renting out the home on Airbnb\n\nAnother landlord found herself in a similar situation with Mr Grasso when she found her property listed on Airbnb.\n\nThe landlord, who wants to remain anonymous, let a two-bedroom flat in Knightsbridge, Central London, to the businessman in 2017.\n\nAfter he moved in, the apartment was quickly rented through Airbnb by a user named Mondi, despite Mr Grasso being the sole tenant.\n\nThe landlord's court case against Mr Grasso took nine months and cost her \u00a310,000 in legal fees.\n\nHer two-bedroom property was brazenly advertised on Airbnb as a three-bed home \u2013 because a bed was put in the living room.\n\nEven when the landlord finally got an order for possession, she had to wait two months for a bailiff's appointment and says Mr Grasso rented out the property until two days before he was finally evicted.\n\nMr Grasso has denied sub-letting either property through Airbnb. He did not respond to requests from The Mail on Sunday for comment.\n\nAn Airbnb spokesman said: 'We have suspended these listings while we investigate. We have zero-tolerance for illegal activity on Airbnb and take appropriate action.'", "description": "Min Boisragon began renting out her \u00a31.5 million property in Chelsea, West London, to Francesco Grasso in March 2017.
