By the end of the year, everything Americans buy from companies in China worth roughly $500 billion in annual imports will cost an additional 15% to 25%, or more.\n\nBy now, the recent escalation of tariffs should come as little surprise to anyone. The administration has continued to increase taxes on Chinese imports over the last year without hesitation.\n\nThe president has become so reliant on tariffs as a negotiating tool that there\u2019s little room left to discuss other more effective policies to deal with China\u2019s misbehaviors\u2014policies that don\u2019t involve taxing American consumers.\n\nYet as the U.S. becomes more desperate for a deal with China, the president\u2019s tough negotiating style is only likely to harden.\n\nIn fact, Trump still has room to increase the tariff rate on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports from 15% to 25%. To think\u2014a president can levy a 10% tax with as much ease as sending a tweet while Congress sits idle.\n\nHe could increase the tariff rate even further, but that would require more time through regulatory procedures.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent decision to further increase taxes wasn\u2019t entirely random. It came after Chinese officials announced Friday morning their plans to levy their own tariffs on U.S. imports.\n\nFor the last year, Chinese officials have consistently responded to U.S. tariffs with their own tariffs. It\u2019s why China has its own tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. imports, and it\u2019s why U.S. farmers have lost significant market share in China.\n\nThis most recent announcement by Chinese officials seemed to upset Trump the most.\n\nPerhaps it was timing. China\u2019s announcement was delayed since Chinese leaders were away for most of August. Or perhaps it was because Trump was on his way to the G7 meeting in France to talk about trade and he wanted to set an example.\n\nRegardless of his reasoning, on Friday, the president\u2019s decision to boost tariffs sent markets into a frenzy.\n\nIn addition to the new tariffs, Trump suggested he could go even further by ordering U.S. businesses to find an alternative to China.\n\nAs of 2018, U.S. companies have directly invested $117 billion in China. Meanwhile, U.S. companies reliant on trade with China would start to close, given the immediate shock to their supply chains.\n\nIt would also have a major negative impact on the global economy. It\u2019s not for nothing that economists are warning the U.S.-China trade war has the potential to tip much of the global economy into a recession.\n\nGiven the size of China\u2019s market, even if American companies could be directed out of China, plenty of America\u2019s economic partners would easily assume the abandoned American share.\n\nTo think, this whole trade war with China started because the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office determined Chinese policies and practices, including cyber-theft, are a cost (not a loss) of $50 billion a year for the U.S. economy.\n\nWhen the president references the billions China is taking out of the U.S., as he did at the G7 meeting, he\u2019s actually talking about the trade deficit. This is in no sense a \u201closs\u201d or \u201ctheft\u201d; it\u2019s commercial exchange. It\u2019s no more China stealing from us than the grocery store steals from you when you buy bread.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough the administration continues to increase taxes on Americans, but to suggest the president can command U.S. businesses where they can and cannot invest is against the principles of a free market economy.\n\nThis administration can do better.", "description": "President Donald Trump announced last week he will add an additional 5% tariff on all Chinese products bought by Americans.\u00a0\n\nThis comes on top of an existing 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of products from China, and an additional tax on roughly $160 billion worth of goods is set to start Sept. 1.", "authors": ["Riley Walters", "Policy Analyst", "Asia Economy", "Riley Walters Is Policy Analyst", "Technology In The Heritage Foundation S Asian Studies Center."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-992415704.jpg?itok=cwWyXXJK"}
