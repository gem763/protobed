He did exactly that in the last round, starring and scoring in the 7-1 win over Grimsby. AFP via Getty Images 3/18 Emile Smith Rowe (Arsenal) Smith Rowe is over an injury issue that stalled the start of his campaign, but will be hoping to push his case for a greater role as a creator, with Unai Emery seemingly looking at him as a number ten. Arsenal FC via Getty Images 4/18 Domingos Quina (Watford) Quina has shown glimpses of his considerable ability since being lured from West Ham, but with Watford hardly flying in the league, a more consistent showing over 90 minutes could see him force his way into a competitive midfield. Getty Images 5/18 Brandon Williams (Manchester United) Man of the match in Manchester United's Europa League win in Serbia, Williams has been elevated to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first team and looks a real talent at left-back. Manchester United via Getty Imag 6/18 Taylor Harwood-Bellis (Manchester City) Already showing signs of real leadership potential, Harwood-Bellis is a centre-half with a wonderfully rounded skillset, and with Pep Guardiola still seeking answers amid an injury crisis of sorts in that area, do not rule out the 17-year-old making a Premier League debut sooner rather than later. Getty Images 7/18 James Garner (Manchester United) Garner is another Manchester United youngster who has been pushed up to the first team, helping see things out in the 3-1 win over Norwich. Calm, composed and classy, he could be a midfield fixture at United for years to come, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer indicated he is in line for a Carabao Cup start this week. Getty Images 8/18 James Justin (Leicester) Recruited from Luton in the summer, Justin looks an excellent capture for the future at Leicester. While a Premier League debut has thus far eluded him despite being named on the bench for all ten games, he was excellent in the last round against his former club and the full-back will be hoping for a similar showing in the fourth round. Getty Images 9/18 Mason Greenwood (Manchester United) While the return of Anthony Martial pushes him down the pecking order, Greenwood can push for greater first team opportunities with a good performance in what is likely to be a largely second-string Manchester United side. Getty Images 10/18 Curtis Jones (Liverpool) One of most highly-rated players in the Liverpool youth ranks Jones could get his chance to show what he's got against Arsenal on Wednesday evening Liverpool FC via Getty Images 11/18 Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves) It is easy to forget how young Gibbs-White is, given his relative prominence compared to some of the faces on this list. A victim, perhaps, of Nuno's commitment to continuity, Gibbs-White has plenty of positive qualities and could be key for Wolves against Aston Villa. Getty Images 12/18 Marc Guehi (Chelsea) Guehi has sought advice from John Terry after making his debut in the last round against Grimsby, and the new England U21 international centre-half looks another uber-talented academy graduate at Stamford Bridge. Getty Images 13/18 Harvey Elliott (Liverpool) Having served his 14-day ban for mocking Harry Kane, Elliott is available for Liverpool this week. A player of considerable promise, his UEFA Youth League showings have fans rather excited. Liverpool FC via Getty Images 14/18 Billy Gilmour (Chelsea) Gilmour's performance at Grimsby had plenty of Chelsea (and Scotland) fans purring, playing with confidence, style and energy in midfield. He probably isn't too far from the first-team picture at either club or international level. AFP/Getty Images 15/18 Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) Saka has taken his opportunities this season, and while his form has cooled somewhat, the Carabao Cup might offer the perfect chance to show his quality again. Arsenal's front four on Wednesday might look something like: Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Smith Rowe, Saka, Gabriel Martinelli - plenty of young talent to warm the cockles of a downcast fanbase. Getty Images 16/18 Keinan Davis (Aston Villa) Certain sections of Villa Park are advocating the dropping of summer signing Wesley in order to give Davis a proper run in the side, which is indicative of how highly they see the forward. Davis played 28 times in the Championship two seasons ago but has fallen out of favour since, and may be looking to reassert himself with a strong showing against Wolves. Getty Images 17/18 Michael Obafemi (Southampton) Obafemi might find his opportunities limited against Manchester City if he starts, but has a goal-scoring knack, easy speed and real intelligence to take advantage of any chances that do come his way. Getty Images 18/18 Eric Garcia (Manchester City) There may only be space for one of Garcia and Harwood-Bellis in the Manchester City fourth round line-up, though they started together in the last round. Garcia is slightly further along, and thus may earn the start. Not an overwhelming physical specimen, Garcia relies on footballing nous and positioning, and looks very much an ideal Pep Guardiola central defender.

Ki-Jana Hoever, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott are among those potentially in the frame for starting berths.\n\nArsenal are also likely to give opportunities to younger players, with Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli perhaps in line for starts in the front four. Reiss Nelson remains absent, and it is unlikely that Mesut Ozil\u2019s exile is ended.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nLiverpool XI: Caoimhin Kelleher; Ki-Jana Hoever, Dejan Lovren, Joe Gomez, James Milner; Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita; Curtis Jones, Divock Origi, Adam Lallana.\n\nArsenal XI: Emiliano Martinez; Hector Bellerin, Rob Holding, Shkodran Mustafi, Sead Kolasinac; Joe Willock, Lucas Torreira; Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka; Gabriel Martinelli\n\nOdds\n\nLiverpool 20/23\n\nDraw 14/5\n\nArsenal 3/1\n\nPrediction\n\nIt is somewhat hard to predict a fixture of this nature, with the exact composition of the two sides unknown. Either side could go with a stronger line-up in a bid to progress, but Liverpool are the more confident squad, and have the added benefit of playing at home.\n\n2-1 to Liverpool is our prediction.", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0host Unai Emery's\u00a0limping Arsenal side in the Carabao Cup with a place in the quarter-finals on offer.
