Razzle, aka Razzle-Dazzle, is a scam posing as a carnival or street game, where you roll marbles in a box collecting points. Popping up in Havana, New York, New Orleans, and curbs and parking lots across the U.S., it\u2019s like Three-Card Monte, but more complicated, and better disguised as a real game.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the appeal, and that\u2019s why a good scammer can keep suckers playing it, paying a couple of bucks a turn until they\u2019ve lost thousands of dollars. Here\u2019s a beautiful demonstration by mathematician James Grime of Numberphile, and magician Brian Brushwood of Scam Nation.\n\nHow it supposedly works\n\nThe scammer calls you over to his stand, and shows you his wooden tray full of little holes, each marked with a number from 1 to 6. You get to roll marbles into the holes, add up those numbers, then consult a chart to see how many points you get. And if you hit ten points, you\u2019ll win a big prize: a Switch, or an iPhone, or a TV, or all your money back. Let\u2019s look at that chart!\n\nConfusing and fun! (Photo: Wikimedia)\n\nSay you roll the marbles, and the numbers add up to 45. Well then: you\u2019ve won 5 points, and you\u2019re halfway to winning! (The \u201cH.P.\u201d on this chart is less clear, but one magic trick seller believes the scammer promises to give your money back if you win on the next roll.)\n\nIt\u2019s a bit dizzying, but so are most games when you start out. You don\u2019t have to learn any strategy, just play the odds. So you pay a buck to play the first round. Just to see how quickly the points add up. And wow, yeah, you got some points right away! You\u2019ll win that TV with like five bucks!\n\nYou keep playing, spending more to make more. Soon you\u2019re very close to winning.\n\nAt one point you make a roll that doesn\u2019t add points, but it does add a new potential prize to the pool. It also doubles the cost per turn. Sure, fine, as soon as you win you\u2019ll make all your money back. So you keep playing.\n\nUntil you\u2019re out of money. No prize. How did your luck turn so fast?\n\nTo feel the energy of the game, watch a demonstration that\u2019s a little more razzle-dazzle than above, from the scam-busting TV show The Real Hustle.\n\nHow it actually works\n\nHow did you earn points so fast, then not at all? Because you never actually earned those points. The scammer lied and pretended you\u2019d rolled the right scores. But your odds of actually rolling those scores are very low.\n\nRazzle boards basically work like rolling a bunch of six-sided dice. (Some versions do use dice.) If you\u2019ve played enough craps or Monopoly, you know that rolling really high or low totals is less likely than rolling middle totals. Your odds of rolling a 7 are 1/6, but your odds of rolling a 2 are 1/36.\n\nRazzle works on the same principle, but you\u2019re rolling eight \u201cdice.\u201d Your odds of rolling, say, 28, are about 1/12. Your odds of rolling an 8 are literally less than one in a million. Seriously, you can test it on this calculator. All the lowest and highest totals are very unlikely, and the middle totals are very likely.\n\nGuess which kind of total gives you points.\n\nThat crazy yellow chart hides the odds, because it puts the totals out of order. Here\u2019s how it would look laid out in order:\n\nClear and disappointing! (Graphic: Nick Douglas)\n\nNow it\u2019s easy to see that all the points come from the numbers at the end. And as this graph illustrates, the numbers at the end are very rare. The most likely point-getting rolls, 17 and 39, are a 1 in 160 chance each. The least likely, 8 and 48, are a 1 in 1.6 million chance. The odds of winning any points on a roll are 1 in 36, and of course most of those rolls get you just half a point.\n\nYou\u2019d have to roll hundreds or thousands of times to rack up enough points. The scammer doesn\u2019t have to weight the marbles, or even sneakily arrange the numbers on the holes. As long as things on the board are pretty random, you\u2019ll never hit your total before you run out of money.\n\nPlay for a very long time, and you would eventually win. But there\u2019s also a 1 in 12 chance of hitting that special 29, which doubles your prize, but also doubles the cost to play. So about every 12 rolls, you start losing money twice as fast. By the time you caught up, you\u2019d spend way more than the cost of a TV.\n\nNo no no wait wait but I scored those points early on!\n\nThe scammer told you that you scored points. He\u2019s been running this game for a while, and he\u2019s learned how to add up numbers really fast. He\u2019s also learned how to add them up wrong, quicker than you notice. And if you do notice, you notice that he \u201caccidentally\u201d gave you points you didn\u2019t earn. So you don\u2019t call it out. You hope he makes the same mistake again. And you make sure he never makes a mistake in his favour.\n\nBut the scammer doesn\u2019t have to make a mistake in his favour. He can honestly tell you when you win points, because you barely ever win points. You can\u2019t catch him in the scam, because the only lie he ever has to tell is that you had any chance of winning.\n\nIf you avoid rolling 29 for a long time, and you seem to be easily fooled by his fake totals, the scammer could fake a 29 to start you doubling your money faster. But he could also just wait, and let the odds take control.\n\nAll he has to do is keep you interested by handing you fake points now and then.\n\nHow cool it is\n\nThere\u2019s something cool about this, right? Scams and gambling are sexy! Ocean\u2019s Eleven! American Hustle! Casino Royale!\n\nRazzle games have been around for generations, run by carnies, streetside scammers, casinos, nightclubs, and the mafia. Cops went on the take for it.\n\nMob families fought for territory rights. Magic shops show off Razzle sets, though they\u2019re cagey about whether they actually sell this tool designed specifically for fraud. The game has a lot of...razzle dazzle.\n\nLike most gambling, it\u2019s less glamorous in person. Here\u2019s a news report of some poor schmuck who wouldn\u2019t let reporters show his face, so they just pointed a camera at his crappy sneakers:\n\nNot so much razzle there. Just stealing a guy\u2019s sneaker money in a parking lot.\n\nA 1981 U.S. Department of Justice report on Razzle-Dazzle says the game can fool \u201caffluent, intelligent marks.\u201d It offers several options for shutting operators down:\n\nWhile the basic criminal charge against a Razzle Dazzle operator would be gambling, it may be possible to press others including fraud, false pretense, larceny, or theft by deception. Law enforcement officers making related arrests should look for records indicating substantial losses by players as well as other items used by the operator which could be analysed by the Gambling Subunit of the FBI\u2019s crime laboratory.\ufeff\n\nSo if you were eyeing the Razzle-Dazzle model in that magic store, maybe keep your money.", "description": "This game is illegal.
