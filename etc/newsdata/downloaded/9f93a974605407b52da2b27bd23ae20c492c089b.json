Pictured, the outside of the Fa-Hien Cave where the tools were found\n\nDense tropical surroundings are challenging to both traverse and inhabit. However, the discovery of these tools \u2014 the exact intended uses of which remain unclear \u2014 suggests humanity spread more diversely than was thought\n\n'We undertook detailed measurements of stone tools and reconstructed their production patterns at the site of Fa-Hien Lena Cave,' said Mr Wedage. Pictured, the cave's interior\n\nWhile further research will be needed to determine exactly how these stone tools were used, the team believe that they were likely employed to hunt, capture and kill tree-dwelling prey like monkeys and tree squirrels.\n\nIn addition, the researchers note that the tools found in the Fa-Hein cave bear a considerable similarity to those used by the local cultures as recently as around 4,000 years ago \u2014 suggest a long-term technological stability in the region.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIn addition, the researchers note that the tools found in the Fa-Hein cave, pictured, bear a considerable similarity to those used by the local cultures as recently as around 4,000 years ago \u2014 suggest a long-term technological stability in the region\n\nArchaeologist Oshan Wedage of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany and colleagues analysed microliths, from the west Sri Lankan cave of Fa-Hein Lena, that date back to around 48,000\u201345,000 years ago", "description": "Archaeologists led from the Max Planck Institute in Germany and colleagues analysed microliths, from the west Sri Lankan cave of Fa-Hein Lena, that date back to around 48,000-45,000 years ago.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/17/19215806-0-image-a-138_1570033630335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
