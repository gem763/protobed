Dalati Nohra/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY\n\nProtests expressing outrage with a ruling elite seen as corrupt have swept Lebanon since last week, paralyzing the country despite announced reforms intended to appease discontent and win over Western donors that have pledged badly needed aid.\n\nIn a televised address, Aoun promised to fight state corruption that he said had \u201ceaten us to the bone\u201d and assured protesters that their \u201cshouts will not be wasted\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am ready to meet your representatives who carry your concerns, to listen to your specific demands,\u201d said Aoun.\n\nThe protest movement has been largely leaderless and it was not immediately clear which, if any, representatives would meet with Aoun.\n\nHe said there was \u201ca need to review the current government,\u201d hinting a reshuffle could be in the cards, but warned protesters that the system could not be changed by crowding public spaces.\n\n\u201cWe will discuss what we can do together to achieve your objectives without causing collapse and chaos, open a constructive dialogue that can lead to a constructive result, and define options that will lead to the best results.\u201d\n\nAoun also vowed that those who had stolen public wealth would be held to account and looted money returned.\n\nProtesters who took to the streets for an eighth day dismissed Aoun\u2019s address and said they refused to back down, saying their main demand was the resignation of the government.\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri, whose government groups nearly all of the main parties in a sectarian power-sharing system, said he \u201cwelcomed\u201d the call to review the current government through \u201cconstitutional mechanisms\u201d.\n\nDruze politician Walid Jumblatt called a reshuffle the \u201cbest solution\u201d to pull the country out of crisis and said it should be followed by new parliamentary elections.\n\nPROTESTERS REJECT SPEECH\n\nProtesters rejected Aoun\u2019s overture.\n\n\u201cNo one can negotiate on behalf of the street. They must achieve the goals of the masses and the government\u2019s resignation is the primary demand,\u201d said Basil Saleh, 39. \u201cThe ball is rolling and it\u2019s not in favor of the government.\u201d\n\nIn the speech, Aoun said he supported proposed reforms to lift bank secrecy and scrap the legal immunity of presidents, ministers, and members of parliament - legislation that could pave the way for corruption investigations.\n\nThe United States, Britain and France have all urged Lebanon in recent days to act quickly on reforms to rein in graft and cut waste, and have expressed support for the protesters.\n\nLebanon is hoping the reforms will convince Western donors to release some $11 billion pledged at a conference last year but contingent on long-delayed reforms.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy, whose mainstays include construction and tourism, has suffered years of low growth due partly to regional turmoil, with war-torn Syria next door. Capital inflows have ebbed.\n\nIn the town of Jal el Dib, protesters waving Lebanese flags brought out umbrellas and raincoats to keep protests despite rain. Some erected makeshift barricades to block a main roadway.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell Michel Aoun, we thought we were your sons. We waited for you eight days and today we realized it was in vain,\u201d said Salaam Zataari, shouting into a microphone to rally a crowd of several hundred.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nGovernment measures announced this week that include halving minister salaries, taxing banks and overhauling the wasteful electricity sector have failed to defuse popular anger and have yet to prod Western donors to move forward on the pledged financing.\n\n\u201cThat speech did not convince us at all. We\u2019ve heard it a lot before. That\u2019s why we\u2019re staying here until the government falls,\u201d said Clara, a university student.", "description": "Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Thursday he was ready for a dialogue with protesters to help save the country from collapse and he suggested a government reshuffle was possible.", "authors": ["Ellen Francis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444465766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0WA", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
