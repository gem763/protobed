It\u2019s obviously a very special day for me.\u201d\n\nAsked about his lack of opportunities until now, Pulisic added: \u201cI\u2019m happy with the progress I\u2019ve made so far and I\u2019m going to go on from there.\u201d\n\nLampard added: \u201cHe had a week\u2019s break this summer. He arrived for a big price and wanted to come straight back in but at the same time why am I going to throw him in?\n\n\u201cI have to do it in the right way and get the best out of him.\u201d\n\nPulisic quickly illuminated a dank evening in Lancashire when his incisive run set up Mason Mount\u2019s blocked shot.\n\nIt was a warning that Burnley failed to heed and Pulisic put Chelsea ahead in the 21st minute.\n\nWhen Matt Lowton dithered in possession near the centre circle, Pulisic pounced to rob the Burnley defender as he stumbled to the turf.\n\n\u2013 Eye-catching Pulisic \u2013\n\nPulisic accelerated into the penalty area and kept James Tarkowski at bay with a step-over before drilling a left-foot shot across Burnley keeper Nick Pope and into the far corner.\n\nBurnley should have been level when Ben Mee\u2019s header reached Ashley Barnes at the far post, only for the striker to nod wide of the empty net from virtually on the line.\n\nOn the stroke of half-time, Pulisic doubled Chelsea\u2019s lead with a fine solo effort.\n\nWillian intercepted Tarkowski\u2019s wayward pass and found Pulisic, who raced towards the Burnley area and drilled a low strike that took a deflection off Mee on its way past Pope.\n\nAs they did against Ajax in midweek, Lampard\u2019s men kept their composure as Burnley pushed hard before Pulisic delivered the knockout blow in the 56th minute.\n\nMount\u2019s cross was cleared back to the midfielder and he curled over a cross that Pulisic met with a well-timed glancing header past Pope.\n\nChelsea were carving through the Burnley defence and Willian made it four in the 58th minute when the Brazilian took Abraham\u2019s pass and slammed a low shot into the far corner.\n\nBurnley suddenly came to life in the closing moments and Rodriguez struck with a 25-yard thunderbolt in the 86th minute.\n\nMcNeil got Burnley\u2019s second with a deflected 89th minute effort, but that failed to take the gloss off Pulisic\u2019s day to remember.", "description": "Burnley (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Christian Pulisic hit a hat-trick to inspire Chelsea\u2019s impressive 4-2 win at Burnley as the US winger enjoyed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/6699b9_chelsea-us-midfielder-christian-pulisic-starred-in-his-demolishing-burnley-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
