The first is the methodone approach: find a substitute that satisfies, without actually feeding, the urge. Alan Hollinghurst writes in an elegant classical style about inheritance and ill-advised alliances, for all that they are predominantly gay. The Sparsholt Affair should do the trick, with its chronicle of art, love and shifting loyalties in the second half of the 20th century. It is, as one critic remarked, \u201cembedded in tradition but entirely new in final effect\u201d. If your taste veers towards the 18th century \u2013 replete with long dashes and semi-colons \u2013 Francis Spufford\u2019s Golden Hill offers a deliriously funny pastiche that also bears its own witness to the birth of the New World. For a gentler remedy, try Mich\u00e8le Roberts\u2019s The Walworth Beauty, which evokes the spectre of Dickensian London through the story of a house and its centuries of residents, or Elizabeth Macneal\u2019s The Doll Factory, a delicately drawn feminist art thriller involving the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, taxidermy and wombats.\n\nThe second prescription is to take the analytical route on the basis that, by parsing your addiction, it will be easier to wean yourself off it. For long, rambling, punctuation-heavy sentences, try Salman Rushdie\u2019s latest, Quichotte (in which junk TV stands in for the romances that addled the brains of Cervantes\u2019s errant knight), or Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport, in which an Ohio housewife revisits her past in eight sentences (and 1,020 pages). Both are contenders for this year\u2019s Booker prize, so you could find yourself a new classic. For stories of disputed inheritance and (possibly) ill-advised marriage, Tessa Hadley will see you right with the delicate humanism of her sibling drama The Past.\n\nThe third prescription is to go cold turkey. A graphic biography such as Alison Bechdel\u2019s glorious Fun Home will present you with a whole new grammar: that of panels, colour palettes, gutters and bleeds. Or try some poetry: Ilya Kaminsky\u2019s brilliant Deaf Republic is a timely story of a small community resisting political oppression \u2013 punctuated by sign language.\n\nSubmit your question to book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk", "description": "Francis Spufford and Mich\u00e8le Roberts will satisfy a classical bent, or try going cold turkey with a graphic novel", "authors": ["Claire Armitstead"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4965b833674120dc62693e45373164d1bf62e04/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26876dd2149b8bc70229fb7343b7025e", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
