They carried banners with slogans including \"Climate change denies our children a future unless we act now\".\n\n\"We're here because the government is not doing enough on the climate emergency,\" protester Lizzy Mansfield said. \"We only get one planet and so we're here to try and defend it.\"\n\nPolice chiefs said last week they would mobilize thousands of officers to handle the protests in London and that anyone who broke the law, even as part of non-violent civil disobedience, would be arrested.\n\nOn Saturday, officers used a battering ram to enter a building in south London where activists had been storing materials to use during the protests. Eight people were arrested during the raid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"OUT OF TIME\"\n\nDefying almost freezing temperatures in Berlin, activists singing \"Solid as a rock, rooted as a tree\" gathered at dawn at the Victory Column roundabout near Tiergarten park.\n\nAt sunrise, some were sleeping in insulated bags in the middle of the roundabout as police on motorbikes drove by. No arrests were made and the protest remained peaceful.\n\nPolice blocked the five avenues that converge on the roundabout to stop cars and buses reaching the demonstration, as this would have resulted in traffic chaos during rush hour.\n\nBy midday, the protest had swelled to 4,000 people, a policeman said, and a second main roundabout was also blocked by activists sitting in the middle of the road.\n\nPolice began removing chanting protesters from Berlin's Potsdamer Platz later in the day after they had occupied the central artery for much of the day, singing, making speeches and fashioning a makeshift camp out of salvaged armchairs and tents.\n\nThe rallies came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended climate protection measures her government is due to approve on Wednesday but which critics have condemned as unambitious.\n\nIn Amsterdam, police were lining up empty city buses to take the arrested demonstrators away as they tried to clear a major thoroughfare in the afternoon.\n\n\"The climate crisis is not being taken seriously enough by politics, and also not by the companies. That's why I joined,\" said one demonstrator, who gave his name as Christiaan.\n\nMeanwhile activists in London, some wearing yellow safety helmets with \"Rebel at Work\" painted on the side, glued or chained themselves to cars parked in the middle of roads or to street lamps, making it hard for police officers to detain them.\n\n\"We are out of time, there is none left, we have to act now,\" said a protester called Benjamin.", "description": "Thousands of climate-change protesters took to the streets in cities around the world on Monday, launching two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience to demand immediate action to cut carbon emissions and avert an ecological disaster.
