Yesterday (Tuesday), I spoke about lecturing at Wits. It is true, chairperson. It doesn't mean, when I say I lectured there, I was employed,\" he said.\n\nHe also told Zondo that he was concerned about media reports which indicated he was at the commission to defend himself.\n\nStream is courtesy of SABC", "description": "Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng is expected to take centre stage at the state capture inquiry.
