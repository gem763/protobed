In time, though, he grew fond of the Montreal\u2019s art and architecture and came to view trips there almost as brief European excursions. But by 2003, when he played for the Expos, the team was splitting its home games with San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Expos ranked last in the N.L. in attendance in each of their final seven seasons, and Zeile said Olympic Stadium sounded hollow, like an echo chamber.\n\nNow the Rays are the team that struggles to draw, and Zeile sees some merit to their idea of eventually splitting home games with Montreal, which M.L.B. has endorsed, at least in concept. But he said it would be hard for a team to win that way.\n\n\u201cIt could be interesting from the perspective of trying to get the most out of a franchise that\u2019s not getting full support in one home \u2014 but you don\u2019t want to take the risk of having lack of support in two homes,\u201d Zeile said.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s certainly going to be an opportunity cost when you consider that you\u2019re going to feel like you\u2019re on the road twice as much as you actually are. It\u2019s hard to have two homes during the season and feel like you\u2019re ever really coming home from a road trip.\u201d\n\nFor Warren Cromartie, an Expos outfielder and first baseman from 1974 to \u201983, the split-season option is more appealing. Cromartie is now the hitting coach for the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, but he has maintained close ties to Montreal, gathering an investment group to bring a team back to the city , which has staged popular spring training exhibitions and is targeting the Yankees for a visit next spring.", "description": "The heritage of the Expos includes a devastating end to their brilliant 1994 season, but also spectacular players who made good elsewhere while never forgetting Montreal.", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/sports/18kepner-expos-print/merlin_157819182_8912a0e8-7125-4d34-af4f-cfdbc6f8f9ed-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
