The video felt similar to Star and Dawson's other videos that compare their individual wealth \u2014 Star is worth an estimated $75 million dollars compared to Dawson's $12 million.\n\nIt's an old trick for the duo that now seems a little out-of-touch. Beyond that, the video also failed to deliver the expected dramatic revelations that viewers have become used to with Dawson's longer, feature-length projects.\n\nThe series' second episode, titled \"The Secrets of the Beauty World,\" was at least more informational about the makeup industry. But, again, it revealed little that wasn't already known.\n\nFor most of the second episode, Dawson and Star are seen in Star's business compound of warehouses, where he shows off a new building and arcade. Star reveals some select figures about his business \u2014 for instance, that he made over $23 million from his Blood Sugar palette, which costs around $20 apiece to manufacture. He also discusses profit margins and contracts with Dawson.\n\nStar says he believes that many personalities have been ripped off in negotiations with makeup companies, and specifically cited a 2016 collaboration between the brand Too Faced and the YouTuber Nikkie de Jager, known to her subscribers as NikkieTutorials. Star accused Too Faced of only cutting de Jager $50,000 for a product that would go on to make over $10 million. Estee Lauder, the company that owns Too Faced, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nAfter Star and Dawson's discussion of makeup profits and merch, Dawson is seen having a brief self-reflective moment where he once again compares his own wealth and capitalization to other YouTubers, and breaks down in the bathroom.\n\nThe moment precedes what appears to be the set-up for the rest of the series: Dawson's self-empowerment through the creation of his own makeup line with Jeffree Star.\n\nIn the rest of the episode, the tone is markedly more upbeat as the duo brainstorms ideas for Dawson's own makeup line and merchandise, with names like \"My Uber's Here,\" \"My Pills,\" and \"Jeffree What The F-ck?\"\n\nWhile a look at the process of how YouTubers actually make money is fascinating, the departure from Dawson's typical subject matter onto the creation of his own makeup line \u2014 an arena in which he has zero experience \u2014 feels much more like a nine-hour infomercial-turned-marketing stunt.\n\nThe series has yet to touch the elephant in the room: the beauty wars.\n\nJames Charles / YouTube\n\nBut so far, the series has yet to touch upon a major beauty YouTuber controversy \u2014 sometimes known as Dramageddon 2.0 \u2014 that hemorrhaged the community this past spring. That gives the first two episodes the feeling of a bait-and-switch, since the preview for the series used copious footage from the controversy.\n\nIn fact, the first episode of Dawson's series barely cites the key Dramageddon 2.0 players besides Star, who is the subject of the series.\n\nThe second episode, however, seems to provide some foreshadowing \u2014 or is at least a clever bit of PR.\n\nStar, who would later throw beauty YouTuber James Charles under the bus and publicly accuse him of predatory behavior, is seen mentioning Charles as a current successful client multiple times, even calling him a \"little brother.\"\n\nThe footage was clearly shot before their relationship imploded and they severed business ties.\n\nOn the one hand, the inclusion of the footage suggests that the coverage of the beauty wars that was seemingly promised may still be coming. From another vantage point, the \"documentary\" appears to allow Star to portray his side of the story that everyone is watching for.\n\nTwo hours into the nine-part series, it's difficult to say definitively where it will go and why it was produced in the first place. But from the current vantage point, the focus is squarely on Dawson's new product line.\n\nWhile that isn't inherently a bad thing, it may leave some scratching their heads over what happened to that unspilled tea.", "description": "It appears that most of the series will be oriented around the launch of Dawson's own makeup line, rather than about the beauty wars.", "authors": ["Benjamin Goggin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d990da3e94e8613a264ea71?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
