One fibre link had been broken by vandalism, it said, and a second fibre link \"also suffered a failure\" several hours.later.\n\n\"This event was unavoidable and MTN immediately reacted by performing optimisation of core flows to minimise the effect on customers services in the affected period; while the fibre repairs continued in the background. These core flows were optimised over two evenings due to complexity of the operation.\"\n\nSeveral affected customers complained that they could not figure out what the problem was, even after multiple calls to MTN support. Asked about communication on the outage, MTN said it had \"communicated with our customers via social media platforms\".\n\nBusiness Insider could find no mention of the issue on the MTN South Africa Facebook page, which is followed by more than 1.4 million people. No notice was posted on MTN South Africa's Twitter account, which has a million followers. Instead the account replied to users who complained about outages directly.\n\nOn 8 October some of those Twitter users were told that MTN was aware of the problem, while others were asked for more details. On the morning of 9 October other individuals were told the issue had been resolved, as others were simultaneously told it was still being dealt with.\n\nWhere customers were given any explanation, they were told MTN had experienced a \"technical glitch with our coverage\".\n\nAsked about its social media approach, MTN said it was satisfied with its \"correct and considered approach for the scale of the problem\", which only affected a fraction of its customers.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The company says it communicated via social media with puzzled customers who could not make calls or connect to the internet at times.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9461/8f5ae9e8a44e48a58155c7521eddc855.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
