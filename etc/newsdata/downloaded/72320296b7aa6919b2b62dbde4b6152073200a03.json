The cost of getting any cooperation from potential partners in future conflicts has skyrocketed. The U.S. also accrued both shame and humiliation; we\u2019ve broken our promises, and Russian troops are posting videos of themselves taking over deserted U.S. bases.\n\nTrump pretends not to care, tweeting, \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d Which sounds an awful lot like green-lighting Turkey\u2019s invasion. (And by the way, Osama bin Laden was 7,000 miles away, too.)\n\nThe price of this latest reckless and destructive folly is dawning on the White House, though: Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper all tried to mop up the mess by denying reality\u2014flatly rejecting that the president had okayed the invasion.\n\nWhen those efforts didn\u2019t stanch the bleeding of the administration\u2019s credibility, the White House dispatched Pence and National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien to Ankara to try to find a face-saving solution. Esper will go to Brussels \u201cto press our other NATO allies to take collective and individual diplomatic and economic measures in response to these egregious Turkish actions.\u201d\n\nPeter Wehner: Trump betrayed the Kurds. He couldn\u2019t help himself.\n\nAmerica\u2019s NATO allies are aghast at Turkey\u2019s brutality, but they also consider U.S. actions egregious. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said, \u201cPresident Trump doesn\u2019t seem to have opposed the operation the Turks are carrying out today, even though much firmer positions are being asserted today.\u201d\n\nIt is important for U.S. troops and for the U.S. public to hear the Pentagon\u2019s civilian leader explain military policies. And Esper, to his credit, isn\u2019t hiding from the media. But the contortions he\u2019s performing to justify the president\u2019s decisions are painful to watch: \u201cTo be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cand U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria. The impulsive action of President Erdo\u011fan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation.\"\n\nBoth the president and Esper make it sound as though there were no alternatives to either fighting a two-front war against both Syria and Turkey or completely withdrawing U.S. forces. This is the kind of straw man that made Republicans scoff at President Barack Obama and his acolytes, when they suggested they had to either abandon Iraq or avoid Syria. There is a wider range of choices available than doing nothing or landing an invasion force at Normandy, to use Trump\u2019s favorite test of allied worth.", "description": "Now the war in Syria has a victor.
