In his resignation letter, Mr. McAleenan attributed his exit to \u201cpersonal and family reasons\u201d and described his tenure as \u201cgalvanizing and enervating.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Kevin-Mcaleenan-Homeland-Security.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
