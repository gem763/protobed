But as is the case with many financial decisions, there are times when putting tuition on a credit card is the right move, and times when it isn't. You decision will depend on a variety of factors, including interest rates, convenience fees, the college in question, and, of course, which card you use.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nRead more: The best credit card sign-up offers available now\n\nThe pros of paying college tuition with a credit card\n\nYou could earn big rewards\n\nMany people swipe their credit cards to earn rewards, such as travel points or cash back. If you pay thousands of dollars of tuition with your card, you have the potential to earn huge rewards. If you earn even just 1 travel point per dollar spent, paying tuition could score you a ton of points.\n\nYou could earn a sign-up bonus\n\nIt's common for credit card companies to offer a sign-up bonus to new customers. To qualify for this bonus, you typically have to spend and pay off a certain amount of money with your card in a designated amount of time. For example, the Capital One Venture Rewards card currently awards new members 50,000 miles if they spend $3,000 in the first three months. Putting tuition on the card could help you spend enough money to receive that bonus.\n\nThis strategy is ideal if you already have the liquidity to pay tuition. You could potentially pay tuition with the card, pay off the full amount the next day, and never have to pay one cent of interest. You'll have scored thousands of bonus points or earned hundreds of dollars for spending money you would have spent on tuition anyway.\n\nRead more: College is more expensive than ever, but \"almost no one\" is paying sticker price\n\nA big purchase can help you meet an annual spending threshold\n\nCertain credit cards reward you for meeting an annual spending threshold. For instance, if you're working toward Delta Medallion elite status an you spend and pay off $30,000 in one calendar year with your Delta Reserve card, you'll receive 15,000 Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs), which are an important element of securing elite status. As with sign-up bonuses, this strategy is great if you can pay off the balance before any interest accrues.\n\nYou might pay 0% APR\n\nYou may be able to find a credit card that offers a 0% annual percentage rate (APR) for a limited amount of time. If you're trying to decide between taking out a student loan and paying with a credit card, the card could be the right choice, because it's tricky to find a student loan with no interest rate.\n\nCredit cards only offer 0% APR for a limited amount of time, typically around one year. If you think you can pay off most or all of the loan before the time limit runs out, you could end up saving a lot of money on interest.\n\nRead more: The best balance-transfer credit cards for paying down debt without interest\n\nThe cons of paying college tuition with a credit card\n\nCredit card APR is most likely higher than student loan APR\n\nCredit card interest rates are notoriously high. In the second quarter of 2019, the average credit card interest rate was 19.29%.\n\nFor the 2019-2020 school year, federal rates are 4.53% for undergraduate loans, 6.08% for graduate and professional loans, and 7.08% for Direct PLUS loans. Beginning private loan rates vary depending on your financial profile and the lender you go through.\n\nAs you can see, credit card APRs tend to be higher than student loan APRs. However, rates will vary from person to person. If you decide to pay tuition with a credit card rather than take out a student loan, but you can't pay off the card relatively quickly, you could accrue more interest and pay more in the long run.\n\nYou'll probably pay fees\n\nMost colleges that accept credit card payments will charge you a convenience fee. In most cases, you'll pay tuition online through a provider that has a partnership with the school. The provider charges a fee when you pay with a card, and rather than covering the fee out of their own pockets, schools require students to pay.\n\nTypically, these fees range from about 2.5% to 3% of your total charge. Many schools set a minimum fee, like $3. Before paying tuition with a credit card, you'll want to calculate how much you'll earn in rewards versus how much you'll pay in fees. If you'll earn $750 in cash back but pay $1,425 in convenience fees, you may realize it's not worth using the card.\n\nYour credit card spending limit might be too low\n\nWhat's your credit card spending limit? If it's lower than the cost of tuition, you'll have trouble paying with a card. Some colleges do allow families to set up tuition payment plans, so you could pay for a semester's tuition in installments if your limit is low. However, each school's payment plan system is different, so you might have to choose between paying part of the tuition with a card and finding another payment method.\n\nThe best credit cards for paying tuition\n\nWhen deciding whether paying tuition with a credit card will work for you, look for cards that offer big rewards, impressive bonuses for signing up and/or for meeting an annual threshold, and even possibly 0% APR for a solid chunk of time. Here are some of the best out there:\n\nColleges that let you pay with a credit card\n\nIt's becoming more common for public colleges to accept credit card payments. However, it isn't the norm yet for private schools to accept cards. Students attending Ivy League schools or colleges like Notre Dame or Duke won't be able to pay tuition with a credit card. For this reason, it can be helpful to know which private schools accept credit cards, and how much they charge in convenience fees.\n\nHere are some private colleges that will let you pay with a credit card:\n\nAmherst College - Amherst, Massachusetts\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $57,640\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.99%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nCarnegie Mellon University - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $55,816\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.52%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nJohns Hopkins University - Baltimore, Maryland\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $51,077-$55,350\n\nCredit card convenience fee: Not specified\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nNote: Johns Hopkins only accepts credit cards in certain departments, and the ability to pay with a card may depend on which term you are enrolling for.\n\nMiddlebury College - Middlebury, Vermont\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $55,790\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.75%\n\nNetworks accepted: Not specified\n\nNortheastern University - Boston, Massachusetts\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $52,420\n\nCredit card convenience fee: Not specified\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nRead more: The best American Express cards\n\nNorthwestern University - Evanston, Illinois\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $56,232\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.5%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nRice University - Houston, Texas\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $48,330\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.85%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nSwarthmore College - Swarthmore, Pennsylvania\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $54,256\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.6%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nVanderbilt University - Nashville, Tennessee\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $50,800\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.65%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nWashington University - St. Louis, Missouri\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $54,250\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.75%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nWashington & Lee University - Lexington, Virginia\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $53,730\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.75%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nWellesley College - Wellesley, Massachusetts\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $55,728\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.99%\n\nNetworks accepted: Not specified\n\nWilliams College - Williamstown, Massachusetts\n\nAnnual undergraduate tuition: $56,970\n\nCredit card convenience fee: 2.99%\n\nNetworks accepted: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express\n\nRead more: The 20 colleges that give the best financial aid, according to students\n\nPaying college tuition with a credit card certainly isn't for everyone.
