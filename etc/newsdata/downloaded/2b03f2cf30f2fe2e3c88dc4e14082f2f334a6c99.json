That\u2019s the way it needs to be. I need to get on with my life. If you have any feeling for me you will let me do this.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t use this as an excuse to go off the rails. Bear in mind you were lucky enough not to go to prison again and I did give you a chance and I had to do this by letter because you just won\u2019t listen to me at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have told you before how I feel and you have chosen to ignore it hoping it will go away, it hasn\u2019t. Each day I feel worse.\n\n\u2018I have to consider my daughter, also and after all you\u2019ve done, I can\u2019t have you back. It\u2019s not fair on her and she knows I would never be happy with you. She can never trust you either.\n\n\u2018Take care, I mean it. Clare.\u2019\n\nAppleton had a history of violence and had been in prison (Picture: PA)\n\nMichael, who said his first meeting with his daughter\u2019s killer is etched on his brain, said: \u2018She told me she had met this lad, she sounded happy enough.\n\n\u2018They appeared out of nowhere one day at my house in Batley. I took an instant dislike to him.\n\n\u2018They had just come from my son\u2019s house and my son asked me what I thought of him and we both had the same opinion. We didn\u2019t like him and want anything to do with him.\n\n\u2018When I found out he had done time in prison that made me curious. Claire said it was because of some motoring offences.\n\n\u2018Because of my job I couldn\u2019t be seen to be reporting with ex-cons and I told her not to bring him back. She understood why I said it. I would still visit her and I was there fairly regularly.\u2019\n\nClare ended her relationship with Appleton in October, 2008, after she found he had been texting other women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018I was chuffed to bits when I heard she had finished it.\n\n\u2018Clare came up to us for Christmas \u2013 two months before she met her fate \u2013 and said George Appleton was making a nuisance of himself. I told her to pack up her things and come back here.\u2019\n\nOn February 5, 2009, Michael received a call from his ex-son-in-law stating he hadn\u2019t heard from Clare.\n\nHe said: \u2018It turned out that my daughter had been beaten, strangled and he had set her on fire and they had to use a cherry picker to get her out.\u2019\n\n\u2018It turns out him being a \u2018nuisance\u2019 was actually attempted rape. He was pulled in and let out numerous times by police,\u2019 added Michael.\n\n\u2018My daughter died because some \u2018man\u2019 couldn\u2019t understand the word \u201cno\u201d.\n\n\u2018Clare didn\u2019t get the protection that one would have expected. You don\u2019t expect to be burying your own child or going to their funeral. That\u2019s not the order of things.\u2019\n\nMichael added: \u2018If I had the information I have now back then I would have marched her straight home.\n\n\u2018The last moments of my daughter\u2019s life were her kicking and screaming trying to get away from Appleton.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
