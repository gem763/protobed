Elizabeth Warren has been a friend of mine for some 25 years, and I think she is a very, very good senator. But there are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth, I think as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not. ... And the reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second, the kind of greed and corruption, income and wealth inequality, and so much suffering, that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.\n\nWhy it matters: Sanders and Warren appeal to a similar progressive base of the Democratic Party. But while Sanders' support seems to have largely hit a plateau, Warren has continued to rise in the polls, overtaking the more moderate Joe Biden in the national RealClearPolitics average of polls last week for the first time this cycle.\n\nBetween the lines: In a recent CBS News poll of Democrats in early voting states, 43% said that the 78-year-old Sanders \u2014 who recently had a heart attack \u2014 is \"too old to serve effectively as president.\" 28% said the same of the 76-year-old Biden, while only 4% said so for the 70-year-old Warren.\n\nGo deeper: Sanders says he felt symptoms for weeks, will release medical records", "description": "The two candidates are both competing for the progressive vote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/xfO4CQWg7_iuAT5wnkrDWtCyQ9I=/0x48:3583x2063/1920x1080/2019/10/13/1570982885862.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
