Good science and life-affirming, ethical research aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. Indeed, it is ethically derived sources\u2014such as discarded surgical tissue and adult stem cells\u2014that have contributed to successful treatments for a variety of ailments, not tissue obtained from elective abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States is a worldwide leader in pursuits of scientific discovery. Thanks to the Trump Administration, federally funded projects will continue conducting vitally important, life-saving research while also respecting innocent human life.\u201d", "description": "Upon news that the Trump Administration has imposed new restrictions on federal funding for fetal tissue obtained via elective abortions, Heritage Foundation research associate Melanie Israel\u00a0offered the following reaction:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
