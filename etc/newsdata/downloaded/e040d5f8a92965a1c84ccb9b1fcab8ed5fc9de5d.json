Medical experts who reviewed CT images of her body concluded she suffered brain injuries which were 'catastrophic and un-survivable', the court was told.\n\nOn June 8 2017, baby Mikayla was taken off life support and placed into her mother Shannon Davies's (pictured right today) arms where she died at 4.46pm. Haining (left) was found to have inflicted catastrophic injuries on her\n\nJudge Lord Pentland said: 'In the early hours of June 8 2017 you killed your baby daughter Mikayla.\n\n'I use the term 'killed' advisably, as the Crown has accepted your late plea of guilty to culpable homicide and not to insist on the original more serious allegation of murder, on the basis you didn't deliberately intend to kill Mikayla.\n\n'Mikayla was 23 days old. She was in your sole care at the time of her death.\n\n'You shook her, causing her head to strike the door that she was so severely injured that she later died.\n\n'Anyone knows that to shake a baby is very dangerous. It was clearly a violent and severe assault on a highly vulnerable baby.\n\n'After the attack, you delayed in seeking assistance and for a time attempted to conceal what you had done.\n\n'Your immediate reaction was to protect yourself, rather than seek help for Mikayla.'\n\nHaining was sentenced to eight years in prison, backdated to September 11, which the judge said that would have been nine years if it had gone to trial.", "description": "Thomas Haining, then 19, stayed up on June 7 2017 to look after 23-day-old Mikayla.
