Besides eating meals comprised of nothing but sliced apples (and very good cheese), I\u2019ve been incorporating apples into everything lately, from salads to desserts and cocktails.\n\nMy current favourite apple-y concoction is a combination of sweet sparkling cider with smokey scotch and complex, herbaceous Benedictine. It\u2019s like a dry, drinkable slice of apple pie, if pie got you quite drunk quite quickly. It\u2019s also very easy to make, and could even be built in the glass if you remember to chill everything beforehand. To make this orchard-appropriate cocktail, you will need:\n\n60mL scotch\n\n15mL Benedictine\n\n90mL sparkling cider\n\nIf you have not chilled your ingredients a head of time, pour the scotch and liqueur into a mixing glass with ice and stir until cold. Strain into a coupe glass, top with cider and sip while wandering around an apple orchard, or something equally twee.", "description": "As far as I'm concerned, apple season is all-year round.
