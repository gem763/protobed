(Picture: Channel 4/METRO)\n\nThe Great British Bake Off might be over for another year \u2013 with David Atherton having been crowned champion \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve forgotten about the contestants already.\n\nAnd two of this year\u2019s participants are keeping the rumour mill churning in the wake of the final, amid suggestions they could be more than just friends.\n\nYup, following all the speculation over finalist Alice Fevronia and fellow baker Henry Bird this year, Henry\u2019s now been linked to someone else entirely, namely 2019 contestant Michael Chakraverty.\n\nJust what is going on? Here\u2019s what you need to know\u2026\n\nWhat is Bake Off stars Henry and Michael\u2019s relationship?\n\nOK, so nobody\u2019s actually confirmed that Henry and Michael are dating (any more than they confirmed that Henry and Alice were dating).\n\nHowever fans of the show have gone wild after Alice shared a photo on her Instagram Stories of Henry and Michael baking brownies together, with the pair looking very cosy indeed.\n\nThis picture has sparked a whole lot of speculation (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThe image sees Henry standing behind Michael as he mixes chocolate in a bowl, resting his head on Michael\u2019s shoulder as he does so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlice captioned the image \u2018Swayze eat your heart out (a reference to the infamous pottery scene from Ghost)\u2026BAE-ke Off,\u2019 ending the phrase with a blue heart emoji.\n\nThe pair definitely seem pretty close (Picture: Instagram)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there though, with the teacher dropping further hints that the pair could be more than just friends with another photo last month.\n\nThis one featured Henry planting a kiss on Michael\u2019s cheek, with the caption: \u2018But how many couples can you see?\u2019\n\nOf course the fans are loving it:\n\nHave Alice and Henry dated?\n\nOnce again it was never confirmed that the pair have had a romance, although they definitely appear close, having bonded in the tent and spent time together since the series was filmed.\n\nThe pair have been very active on Instagram, with Alice sharing snaps of her and Henry at the Tate Modern after she was named Star Baker in Biscuit Week.\n\nTheir fellow bakers were quick to comment on that occasion, with Helena Garcia saying: \u2018You two couldn\u2019t possibly be more adorable,\u2019 while Michael called them a \u2018beautiful couple\u2019.\n\nHowever Alice has since denied the claims she and Henry were more than just friends, taking to Instagram to call him her \u2018brother from another mother\u2019.\n\nThe Great British Bake Off will return in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
