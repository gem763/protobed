Old Joe. Sputtering Joe. The Septuagenarian Slug. He\u2019s That Seventies Show. The woke Democratic caucus waits for him to forget a name, or mistake his cellphone for the remote. Ditto the woke press. He mentioned \u201crecord player,\u201d for God\u2019s sake, answering a question about racism!\n\nKeep waiting. In a debate where Democrats finally went there on guns, saying what most Americans already believe \u2014 \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d said Beto O\u2019Rourke, in the line of the night \u2014 they finally went there on the big Biden question: his age.\n\nSign up for the Morning Briefing Newsletter.\n\nThe takedown couldn\u2019t come from fellow 70-somethings, Senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Sanders\u2019s voice was in the key of gravel, making his Brooklyn accent more distracting than normal when he shouted, \u201cWe can do mo-wah!\u201d And Warren was on her best behavior.\n\nSo the dirty work fell to Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Obama cabinet member. He got right to it with an opening jab against \u201cold ideas,\u201d and then a direct slap, asking Biden: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Um, no.\n\nIt was a big backfire, a cheap shot that fell to the floor. But it did finally bring out into the open the \u201cism\u201d that dare not speak its name. You\u2019ll hear plenty more of it, much of it coming from the infantile 73-year-old president, who, just this week, seemed to forget that he had a son with his third wife.\n\nAge itself is not the problem. Winston Churchill was in his mid-70s when he became, for a second time, Britain\u2019s prime minister. Konrad Adenauer served as chancellor of postwar Germany well into his 80s. And how old was Nelson Mandela when took office as South Africa\u2019s first black president? He was 75.\n\nBut age will be the weapon that Biden\u2019s opponents will use, because it\u2019s basically all they have.\n\nBiden is running as a normal guy. Normal is dull. It stirs no blood. Normal is not having to worry about who\u2019s piloting the plane; it\u2019ll land. Uncle Joe is comfort food, the \u201cHome is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in,\u201d in Robert Frost\u2019s words.\n\nBut can normal be transformative? Is it enough to say that our long national nightmare is over, as people work through the post-traumatic stress syndromes that\u2019ll be left behind by Trump?\n\nBiden\u2019s persistent big lead in the polls over Trump is your answer. So what if he repeats \u201cbattle for the soul of America\u201d in framing the election over and over. It is. In the Trump era, a majority will choose avuncular over authoritarian any day.\n\nBiden took his energy drink, or something. He came out on fire. He was sober, direct, returning volleys from the two lefties on either side of him. \u201cFor a socialist you have a lot more faith in corporate America than I do,\u201d he said to Sanders.\n\nBut a half-hour into this third Democratic debate, many Democrats had to be wondering: Can he go three hours? It\u2019s our own collective ageism.\n\nHe did, closing with his most appealing side: his humanity and vulnerability. After the El Paso shootings, Trump showed he couldn\u2019t even pass the base test of a human being, demonstrating a smidgen of empathy. He couldn\u2019t even fake it. Not for a minute. Biden bleeds empathy. What\u2019s appealing about him is what my colleague Jennifer Senior called \u201cthe bartender aspect\u201d of his character, in her review of his book on the loss of his son Beau.\n\nProgressives looking for someone who will bring big structural changes should remember that we are electing not just a president, but an executive branch. I have no doubt that Biden would sign any kind of advanced legislation that can get by the Neanderthals holding the Senate back in the last century.\n\nWaiting for Uncle Joe to collapse is not a winning strategy. Most of the other candidates in Thursday\u2019s debate seemed to get that. O\u2019Rourke had his best night. This is the rare politician who\u2019s not afraid to let it rip, the b.s. valve turned off. Kamala Harris is brilliant, and would crush Trump in a debate. \u201cYou can go back to watching Fox News,\u201d was her line that should be on bumper stickers soon. And on the shootings, she said of Trump: \u201cHe didn\u2019t pull the trigger but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.\u201d\n\nFor the two of them, though, it may too late: both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump led at this stage in the polls four years ago.\n\nPete Buttigieg, born in 1982, nearly a decade after Biden entered the Senate, makes a pitch for generational change, citing John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. He\u2019s got the right song in the wrong presidential year. Remember the guy who specifically called for passing the generational torch in an earlier debate? Me neither. (It was Representative Eric Swalwell.)\n\nCory Booker, another man of reason and intellect stuck in a politician\u2019s body, inadvertently gave Biden some cover, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for his candidacy. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.\u201d That\u2019s the calculation most Democrats are making as well, and why Biden is the likely nominee.\n\nTimothy Egan (@nytegan) is a contributing Opinion writer who covers the environment, the American West and politics.
