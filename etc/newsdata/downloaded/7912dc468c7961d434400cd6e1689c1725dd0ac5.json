There was no midwife involved. They all did that themselves.\n\n'A daughter had a birthday on the same day as my daughter. They often played together. But only in their back garden. The children never went out on the street or came to our house. You'd often see them climbing in the trees.\n\n'The children didn't go to a school in the neighborhood. But I saw them leave every morning with a bag with their father, so I assumed they were going to school somewhere else.'\n\nMrs Soar said Brunner only lived in the street for a very short time. She said she thought he knew the reclusive van Dorstens before he moved in because shortly afterwards they removed a fence that separated their back gardens.\n\nBut by 2004 before Geert's wife died in mysterious circumstances, he had already left.\n\nMrs Soer said: 'One day Gerrit-Jan came and told me that his wife had just died of colon cancer. Nobody knew she was that sick. No one knew when she was buried.\n\nA woman who used to be 'Josef the Austrian's next door neighbor said he had only lived on the street, next to the 'imprisoned family' for a short time\n\nOfficers raided this property on Sunday where they discovered Jan's family living in an 'enclosed space'. Josef Brunner, 58, who rented the property, was arrested\n\nJan Zon van Dorsten, 25, is the son who alerted Dutch police to the plight of his four brothers and sisters and their father, who were living in isolation at a remote house while apparently waiting 'for the end of times'\n\n'Not long after, the family had left but they continued to pay the rent for the house. One of the daughters lived in the house for a while. I think she was sixteen. But a short time later when someone from the housing association came round, the house was vacated.'\n\nMr van Dorsten and Brunner both shared a passion for woodwork. He was a toy maker and his eventual captor built wooden canoes.\n\nBrunner only lived at in the ground floor of the house at de Weerd in Hasselt for a few months and disappeared.\n\nMs Soer went on: 'I was surprised that they had remained in contact and even more shocked when I heard what had happened to Geert and his family.\n\n'Josef was never friendly. He never said hello. He wasn't friends with anybody.\n\n'He never had a wife. He never had a girlfriend. He would never go to a bar. He was just mysterious.\n\n'When they left, I didn't know where they'd gone.\n\n'It was a total surprise to me that they were still in touch with Josef. This is a very sad situation for the family.'\n\nJan raised the alarm after walking from the house to a local bar where he ordered five beers and told the bartender that he couldn't go home\n\nCafe De Kastelein in Ruinerwold where Jan Zon van Dorsten drank beer and raised the alarm\n\nNative Creative Economy, a company based in Meppel which is owned by Josef Brunner\n\nGeert owned a toy shop and moved over the years into rented properties in the village in Zwartsluis before moving into the rented detached house at Ruinerwold which has been sealed off by police.\n\nThe van Dorstens allegedly lived like hobbits in the basement of the remote farmhouse for almost a decade before their secret was exposed this week when the eldest son walked into a bar and told the owner how the family had been living.\n\nJan Zon van Dorsten, 25, drank five pints of beer in the caf\u00e9 De Kastelein and revealed to the owner Chris Westerbeek how they had been living.\n\nNeighbours said they had been suspicious about Brunner who would go back and forth from the house to his workshop 15 miles away in a Volvo every day.\n\nMeanwhile MailOnline can reveal how Brunner lived illegally in a trailer four miles from the house where the family of six were imprisoned.\n\nThe caravan was parked behind his workshop at Meppel.\n\nHe would make weekly visits to a local Lidl supermarket in to stock up on supplies for the family.\n\nA man who owns a building business next door said: 'I have known him for about seven years, but I really know very little about him.\n\nPolice continued working at the property Wednesday, as they try to unravel the mystery of how the family came to be there, and whether they were being kept against their will\n\nPolice say they are puzzled by the case - a mystery that is deepened by the fact that Jan had access to social media and had been posting since June this year until the time he was rescued\n\n'I would see him every day, but he will just say hello. Only wants to look inside his work premises and I saw a trailer hidden behind a wall where he was living.\n\n'I could never have imagined that he had another home and six people were in there. He never ever talk about friends or anybody.\n\nIt is not allowed for him to live here, but he used to.\n\n'I was curious because he would buy something like 50 toilet rolls and huge boxes of food once a week and then drive off with them. But he lived here. So he wasn't living with that family.'\n\nAnother man, a truck driver, said: 'He was always very secretive. He never spoke with anybody.\n\n'He would reverse his blue Volvo onto the drive of his workshop, and then go inside for the night. Nobody knew him. He didn't want to speak to anybody.'\n\nBrunner, known as 'Josef the Austrian' will appear in court on Thursday, as it emerged the family can barely talk and speak in a 'fantasy language' after spending nine years in isolation.\n\nInvestigators today revealed they had difficulty understanding the victims, with parts of their speech deemed 'incomprehensible' - and said they slept and ate on the floor in a room with no windows, according to local reports.\n\nDespite sharing a 'small, enclosed space' with no natural light, police confirmed the family were not malnourished and looked 'normal'.\n\nJan was active on Facebook until 2010, when it is thought his family moved to the house, before his profile went silent - only to activate again in June this year\n\nInvestigators admit they are still deeply puzzled by the case and are still working to answer key questions - such as whether the family were held against their will by Brunner.\n\nHowever more details may emerge when he appears in court for the remand hearing, after being charged with the deprivation of liberty and prejudicing the health of others.\n\nNeighbours told local media they were puzzled by the man - described as a skilled 'wood-worker' - as it emerged the 'odd-jobs-man' had asked neighbours for renovation tips such as laying concrete and appeared to have renovated the isolated home alone.\n\nHe would reportedly ask locals for tips on building and construction but would not elaborate on where he lived or with whom.\n\nOne local told Bild newspaper: 'The man has renovated all this alone, came with his trailer and building materials. I've always wondered 'how can he do it all on his own?'\n\n'He must have had help, it can not be done on his own.'\n\nPolice were still present at the house on Wednesday, three days after the initial raid took place\n\nThe house is located in Ruinerwold, around 60 miles north of Amsterdam, and it is thought the family moved there in 2010\n\nResidents also claim Brunner had surveillance cameras around the property, kept the gate locked and peered through binoculars.\n\nHe would reportedly 'chase' people away that strayed too close to the house.\n\n'It was enough for you to come near the farm and he sent you away. He followed everything with binoculars,' one local told Aftonbladet.\n\nLocal media said Brunner had a small workshop in Meppel and came to the Netherlands in 2010, the same year the family were locked up at the remote house, though the Austrian authorities have yet to confirm this.\n\nIt comes after the first pictures emerged of Jan Zon van Dorsten, 25, who saved the family after he walked to a nearby bar and asked for help.\n\nPolice say Jan had been living in a 'small, enclosed space' for the last nine years until he appeared at the bar.\n\nThe mystery is deepened further by the fact that Jan, the eldest son, had access to social media and had been active on Facebook since June this year.\n\nPosts on his public profile show he used the platform for several years until 2010, when he posted saying that he had moved to Ruinerwold - the village where the house is located.\n\nPolice raided the property along with a workshop belonging to Brunner in the nearby village of Meppel, where Jan listed himself as working\n\nBar owner, Chris Westerbeek, recalled the 25-year-old man came in numerous times over a number of days and looked 'confused'\n\nPolice spokesman Ramona Venema confirmed the family was found at the remote house\n\nThe profile then goes silent until June this year, when it suddenly reactivated with a post announcing that Jan was working as an online store manager at Creconat, located in Meppel - a village around four miles from Ruinerwold.\n\n'Creativity for everyone!' the post says.\n\nCreconat is associated with a timber company called Native Creative Economy, also based in Meppel, which is owned by Brunner, according to De Telegraaf.\n\nPolice raided the premises on Monday, a neighbour said. It is not clear what, if anything, was found.\n\nJan spent his time on social media posting pictures of nature and promoting causes, such as climate strikes.\n\nOn Saturday he uploaded three photos of landmarks around Ruinerwold that were taken in the dark. It is thought these were taken while he was walking to the bar.\n\nIt is reported he went to the bar three times before the barman - Chris Westerbeek - called police, describing Jan as dishevelled, confused and needing help.\n\nNone of Jan's family were registered on government databases, police have confirmed - perhaps indicating how they managed to go undetected for years.\n\nLocal media reported Brunner was born in Vienna. The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs could only confirm that Josef has requested not to be contacted by the embassy, and has refused their help.\n\nA man named online as Tonnie, who had the workshop next to Josef's, told Dutch news site ED that he was a highly skilled woodworker and often made parts for pleasure yachts. 'A real craftsman,' he said.\n\nAlida ten Oever, who owned the house and rented it to Josef, said that he always paid rent on time and that she never saw signs of other people living at the property.\n\nNeighbours told RTV Drenthe that Josef was a private man who never allowed visitors inside the house.\n\nThe house itself was set back 200 yards from the nearest road, and another 100 yards from the nearest building.\n\nPictures show it was surrounded by trees, blocking off the view, and also had a perimeter fence.\n\nVegetables were being grown in plots surrounding the property, while a goat was also kept there.\n\nLocals who visited said there was a security camera trained on the yard, and there were suspicions within the village that Josef was growing cannabis.\n\nHowever, as news of the family spread, there was widespread shock and disbelief.\n\n'We are quite perplexed about it all,' landlady Oever said.\n\nRuinerwold mayor Roger de Groot told a press conference that neither he nor the police had ever seen anything like it.\n\nSpeaking about the inside of the house, he added: 'The police found a number of rooms with makeshift furnishings where the family lived a withdrawn existence. That is where the six were found.'\n\nHe denied that the family had been living in a basement.\n\nA statement from local police said Brunner was refusing to cooperate with the investigation but was detained and being interrogated.\n\n'We understand that everyone still has many questions,' a police spokesman said. 'We do too. That is why we want to do our research thoroughly and carefully.\n\n'This means that we may not be able to answer everything immediately. Simply because sometimes we don't have answers yet. Or we cannot share them.\n\n'We have called in a Large Scale Investigation Team (TGO). Investigators are probing possible criminal offenses under the leadership of the Public Prosecution Service.'", "description": "Josef Brunner, 58, is accused of keeping a family prisoner beneath the floor of a remote property in Ruinerwold, in the Netherlands, as they 'waited for the world to end'.", "authors": ["Shekhar Bhatia In Ruinerwold", "Netherlands", "For Mailonline", "Sophie Law", "Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19808190-0-image-a-2_1571260592839.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
