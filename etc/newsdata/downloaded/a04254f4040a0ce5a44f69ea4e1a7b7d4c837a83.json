O'Brien, the Trump administration\u2019s top hostage negotiator, monitored the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky in Stockholm this summer. (Erik Simander/AP)\n\nPresident Trump entered his next phase of vetting for a new national security adviser, interviewing his top hostage negotiator Robert C. O\u2019Brien at the White House on Friday and combing through a growing list of candidates with diplomatic, military and business experience.\n\nThe ouster of his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, has set off a turbulent contest among the Republican Party\u2019s hawks and doves to install an adviser who will help guide the president as he seeks to broker a landmark nuclear deal with North Korea, a withdrawal from Afghanistan and an easing of tensions with Iran.\n\nThe president\u2019s most trusted foreign policy adviser, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is quietly supporting three of his close colleagues, according to U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the matter. Those candidates include O\u2019Brien; Brian Hook, special envoy for Iran; and Ricky Waddell, assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\n\nVice President Pence\u2019s national security adviser, Keith Kellogg, and the president\u2019s ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, are also under consideration for the position, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel decisions.\n\nEach candidate is coming under scrutiny from influential advisers who have a stake in who becomes the next coordinator of America\u2019s vast foreign policy apparatus.\n\nIn the deliberations, U.S. officials have questioned the loyalty of Hook, who entered the State Department under former secretary of state Rex Tillerson and has come under attack by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has called him an \u201cunapologetic neocon\u201d with an \u201cundisguised contempt for Donald Trump.\u201d Those criticisms have been blunted by the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has worked with Hook on Middle East issues and spoke up for him during a recent meeting with Trump, said a senior U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHook declined to comment.\n\nO\u2019Brien, a founding partner of a Los Angeles law firm, served in previous U.S. government roles focusing on Afghanistan and the Middle East. Officials view him as a \u201csafe choice\u201d given his strong rapport with colleagues at the State Department and Pentagon. His \u201caffable demeanor\u201d contrasts with Bolton, who was known as a ruthless bureaucratic infighter, the official said. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire in the White House to have a team player.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien has praised Trump for having \u201cunparalleled success\u201d in bringing home hostages, though his appearance in Stockholm in July to monitor the trial of U.S. rapper A$AP Rocky drew guffaws as critics assailed Trump for what they viewed as an inappropriate intervention in an allied nation\u2019s legal matters.\n\nO\u2019Brien declined to comment.\n\nGrenell is expected to meet with the president to discuss the position on Saturday. Like O\u2019Brien, he previously worked with Bolton. Grenell has clashed with Pompeo and other State Department officials in his role as top diplomat to Berlin, where he has interpreted the role broadly and not always coordinated with other U.S. ambassadors in Europe, officials said.\n\nGrenell did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s top negotiator for North Korea, Steve Biegun, has also been shortlisted for the national security adviser position, but officials have said he may vie for the deputy secretary of state position, which could put him in a position to become the top U.S. diplomat if Pompeo decides to run for Senate in Kansas.\n\nAs Trump weighs the critical personnel decision, his expressed desire to withdraw from Afghanistan and de-escalate with Iran have unnerved the neoconservative wing of the Republican Party and prompted feuds with other conservatives who favor a more restrained foreign policy.\n\nOn Thursday, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming launched into a multiday Twitter feud indicative of the two poles of Republican foreign policy.\n\n\u201cFew people have been as wrong on foreign policy over the last few years as the neocons and @Liz_Cheney,\u201d tweeted Paul. \u201cWhile they might exist, I sure haven\u2019t heard of a war that Liz _Cheney didn\u2019t want us to get involved in. When @realdonaldtrump wanted to end the war in Syria \u2014 you guessed it, #NeverTrumper Liz Cheney came out against the president.\u201d\n\nCheney called the exchange \u201cenlightening\u201d and attempted to claim the pro-Trump banner for herself.\n\n\u201cThere are some issues at the heart of that disagreement,\u201d she said during a news conference at the House GOP\u2019s annual retreat on Friday. \u201cThere are issues surrounding whether you put America first, as Trump does, or if you blame America first, as Rand Paul does and has for years.\u201d\n\nThe fight isn\u2019t purely academic, analysts said, as the president seeks to transition from a foreign policy of maximum pressure against North Korea and Iran, to one of dealmaking and diplomacy.\n\n\u201cWe are entering into a new phase,\u201d Tom Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in the Atlantic. \u201cTrump has always had two images of himself on national-security issues \u2014 as a militarist and as a dealmaker. As he nears the election, he hopes to move from the former to the latter.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Trump shot down the idea of tapping Pompeo to serve simultaneously as national security adviser and secretary of state. He also said many potential candidates have expressed interest in the position.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants it badly, as you can imagine,\u201d he said, despite his administration\u2019s historically high job turnover rate. \u201cA lot of people want the job \u2014 it\u2019s a great job. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump. It\u2019s very easy actually to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don\u2019t have to work.\u201d\n\nAnne Gearan, Josh Dawsey, Missy Ryan and Greg Jaffe contributed to this report.", "description": "Possible candidates include the president\u2019s top hostage negotiator and the ambassador to Germany.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fjwlCxrZxK3OXtKky3HJqoZakgo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SNCWIKFTYQI6TCKJL43P7ETQNY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
