(Photo: Rachel Luna/FilmMagic)\n\nOlivia Newton-John may be battling cancer for a third time, but the 71-year-old star is determined to beat the odds.\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s episode of CBS This Morning, Newton-John took co-host Gayle King on a tour of her California ranch, where she showed off everything from her pair of miniature horses (\"Harry and Winston \u2014 they're my little jewels!\") to her collection of marijuana plants.\n\n\u201cHere are the little babies,\u201d said Newton-John, as she showed King her smaller marijuana plants growing in cups.\n\nThat marijuana is part of what\u2019s helped Newton-John through her health issues. Though she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, on the same day as her father\u2019s death, the cancer spread to her back in 2013. While it later went into remission, the cancer returned again two years ago. Physicians told Newton-John that it was Stage 4, and she says the pain can be horrific.\n\n\"Crying kind of pain,\u201d Newton-John explained. \u201cTears pain.\"\n\nStill, Newton-John said she never felt victimized by her diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t discuss prognosis, because if they give you a percentage or \u2018this many women get this and live this long,\u2019 you can create that and make it happen. I know what the statistics are, but I put them away. I\u2019m going to live longer than that,\u201d she told King. \u201cI\u2019ve made that decision.\u201d\n\nWhile she \u201ctries not to\u201d think about death \u2014 \u201cI could die tomorrow, a tree could fall on me,\u201d she noted \u2014 Newton-John said she prefers to meditate and be peaceful knowing the people she loves are surrounding her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decision, how you choose to feel about something. So I\u2019ve chosen that path,\u201d she told King. \u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019m lucky. I\u2019m grateful. I have much to live for, and I intend to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nNow retired from performing, Newton-John enjoys a quiet life on her ranch with her husband John Easterling, whom she married in 2008. An advocate of the healing power of plants, Easterling keeps a flourishing grow house filled with cannabis for his wife.\n\nShe has since created the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, and will be auctioning off some of her most famous outfits and costumes, including several from films like Xanadu and Grease. That includes the iconic leather pants she sported as Sandy in the beloved 1978 film, which Newton-John was willing to put on one last time with a little coaxing from King.\n\n\u201cOnly you could get me to do this,\u201d she told King.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The \"Grease\" star showed off the marijuana plants that help treat the pain \u2014 and even slipped on her \"Bad Sandy\" leggings from \"Grease.\"", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cz9TjYooX8Bb6MPjXHduvA--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9MjE1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/543c9610-e2dc-11e9-9fff-2dac10b091ec", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
