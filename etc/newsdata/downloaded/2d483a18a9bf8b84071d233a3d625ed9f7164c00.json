For a week at least.\n\nA beatdown of the Philadelphia Eagles goes a long way in Dallas and the NFC East, and that\u2019s exactly what the Cowboys delivered in a 37-10 victory over their division rival.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCowboys convert on early Eagles mistakes\n\nThe Cowboys pounced on early mistakes by the Eagles, converting a pair of first-quarter turnovers into touchdowns to take a 14-0 lead.\n\nJaylon Smith recovered a fumble by tight end Dallas Goedert near midfield on Philadelphia\u2019s opening drive. The Cowboys responded with a touchdown drive that ended with a 20-yard scamper from wide receiver Tavon Austin.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe next Eagles possession lasted two plays before DeMarcus Lawrence sacked Carson Wentz and forced a fumble that the Cowboys recovered at Philadelphia\u2019s 14-yard line. Two Ezekiel Elliott runs later, and the Cowboys had a 14-0 lead.\n\nFrom there, they didn\u2019t look back as their defense never allowed the Eagles offense to get on track to make things competitive.\n\nA win over the Eagles goes a long way, but doesn't answer all the questions surrounding the Dallas Cowboys. (Tom Pennington/Getty Images)\n\nCrucial win after 3-game losing streak\n\nIt was a critical win for the Cowboys, who face a stout remaining schedule that includes games against the New England Patriots, Chicago Bears, Los Angeles Rams, Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills and another matchup with the Eagles \u2014 all teams that should figure into the playoff hunt.\n\nThey improve to 4-3 and sit atop the NFC, a game ahead of Philadelphia with a leg up in head-to-head matchups.\n\nThat edge in the standings means Dallas\u2019 schedule becomes slightly less daunting as the reeling Eagles are the team coming out of Sunday night looking up in the division standings.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuestions still linger\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t erase the troubling signs that showed up in consecutive losses to the Jets, New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers after a 3-0 start against the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins and pre-Daniel Jones New York Giants \u2014 some of the league\u2019s worst teams.\n\nAfter feasting on the league\u2019s dregs, the Cowboys looked like a second-tier team when facing top-shelf NFC competition. Then the Jets loss raised serious questions about whether the Cowboys are legitimate contenders.\n\nSunday\u2019s victory didn\u2019t answer those questions. But the Cowboys got the big games they\u2019ve come to expect from their offensive triumvirate of Elliott, quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver Amari Cooper, all of whom excelled Sunday.\n\nPrescott connected on 21-of-27 passes for 239 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He added 30 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Elliott finished with 111 yards and a touchdown on the ground while catching six passes for 39 yards. Cooper led the team with five catches for 106 yards.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys defense limited the Eagles to 283 yards from scrimmage while forcing four turnovers.\n\nThey\u2019re all good signs that stopped the bleeding that resulted from the Cowboys\u2019 three-game losing streak. But there\u2019s still a long way to go in Dallas.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "A win over the Eagles goes a long way, but doesn't answer all the questions surrounding the Dallas Cowboys.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/o2QyUmPhAcgmlGrhXUIR6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZLqm_s.Oy.Fsr2AhOgJBg--~B/aD0zMDA5O3c9NDUxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/95167a30-f3b1-11e9-9ef9-286e00e34470", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
