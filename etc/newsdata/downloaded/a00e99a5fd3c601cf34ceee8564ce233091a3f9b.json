It described Brown as \u201can unrestricted free agent,\u201d meaning he had no contractual obligations to any team.\n\n\u201cOur office is presently investigating multiple allegations, some of which are the subject of pending litigation\u201d the NFL statement continued. \u201cWe have as yet made no findings regarding these issues. The investigation is ongoing and will be pursued vigorously and expeditiously.\n\n\u201cAs long as Mr. Brown is a free agent, placement on the Commissioner\u2019s exempt list is not appropriate. If he is signed by a club, such placement may become appropriate at any time depending on the status of the investigation. Upon conclusion of the investigation, he may also be subject to discipline if the investigation finds that he has violated the law or league policies.\u201d\n\nNo new deal for Brown is likely to happen until after the NFL's investigation is completed, a league source told ESPN.\n\nBrown appeared in just one game for the Patriots, who had signed him 11 days earlier \u2013 soon after he was let go by the Oakland Raiders, who had acquired Brown in March in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nANTONIO BROWN'S TIMELINE OF DRAMA: DETAILS OF THE STAR WIDE RECEIVER'S INCIDENTS\n\nPittsburgh traded Brown in part because of a clash with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nBrown\u2019s controversies during his brief stay in Oakland were numerous. They included Brown missing practices because of frostbite on his feet from a cryotherapy treatment, a dispute over what type of helmet he would wear in games and a reportedly heated confrontation with Oakland general manager Mike Mayock.\n\nFinally fed up, Oakland released Brown on Sept. 7 and he quickly signed with New England, the defending Super Bowl champions.\n\nBut before Brown played his first game with the Patriots, he was accused in a civil suit of sexually assaulting and raping his former trainer on three separate occasions in 2017 and 2018. Brown\u2019s attorney said his client denied the allegations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThen a second accuser emerged, an artist who claimed Brown made an unwanted sexual advance while the woman was inside the player\u2019s home after being hired to paint a portrait of him. She is the accuser whose lawyer says she received \u201cintimidating\u201d text messages from Brown on Wednesday night.\n\nThe lawyer notified the NFL Thursday and the Patriots released Brown from his contract the next day.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this story.", "description": "Antonio Brown has been cut loose by two NFL teams this month amid a list of controversies that include sexual assault and rape allegations \u2013 but some of the other teams in the league are still expressing interest in his services as a top-flight wide receiver, according to his agent.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/20/694940094001_6088178239001_6088172417001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
