[...]The last couple of weeks, as it\u2019s dipped below $8,000 we\u2019ve bought, and we\u2019ve seen $8,100, $8,200, $8,300.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin eventually will exceed $20,000\u201d\n\nWhile he admits that he does not know where the price of Bitcoin will be headed next, he said that the upper $6,000 range could be revisited.\n\nStill, after such fluctuations, he believes Bitcoin will resume its upward movements towards May next year given the upcoming halving of miners\u2019 block rewards \u2014 an event that will cut the supply of newly minted Bitcoin in half.\n\nBirch concluded:\n\n\u201cI do believe that Bitcoin eventually will exceed $20,000, and I think that any price below $8,000 is a good price to buy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, despite the latest BTC price plunge, Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, also voiced shared his opinion on Oct. 23.", "description": "\u201cI do believe that Bitcoin eventually will exceed $20,000,\u201d says Joel Birch, founder of crypto hedge fund Lunar", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMGUxNjQwYzcyOTg4ZTY0YjA1YjI3OTI5YTlhNWFlODEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
