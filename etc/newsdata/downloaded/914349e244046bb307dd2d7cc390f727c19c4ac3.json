Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nSo Teigen, who\u2019s become a social media superstar for sharing unfiltered and relatable posts of her kitchen fails and parenting struggles, clapped back in an obscenity-laced tweet that mocked the POTUS for tagging everyone but her in his post by calling him a \u201cp**** ass bitch.\u201d\n\n\u201c[W]hat a p**** ass bitch. [T]agged everyone but me. [A]n honor, mister president.\u201d Chrissy Teigen\n\nShe also shared a picture of herself creating a chalkboard sign for her 3-year-old daughter Luna\u2019s first day of preschool, once again calling the president the profane insult and referring to what she called his \u201c9th meltdown of the day.\u201d\n\nLuna, remember the night before your first day of school? When mommy was making your sign and the pussy ass bitch president had his 9th meltdown of the day pic.twitter.com/ZFZHJYrDPG \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nOf course, the president is no stranger to swearing, himself. The New York Times, which has dubbed him the \u201cprofanity president,\u201d counted Trump using 10 \u201chells,\u201d as well as an \u201cass\u201d and a couple of \u201cbullsh\u2014s\u201d in a single Panama City Beach, Fla., speech in May.\n\nAnd a recent analysis found that lawmakers are swearing more than ever on Twitter TWTR, -2.55% this year, dropping an obscene 1,225 curse words on the social media site as of August. And overall swearing by politicians on Twitter (not counting the s- or f-words) jumped 549% between 2016 and 2017, the year Trump was inaugurated as president.\n\nCheck out the chart showing the obscene amount of swearing by politicians here.\n\nOf course, many of us are being more liberal with spewing profanities in public. More than half of employees admitted in a 2018 CareerBuilder survey that they curse at work. And even silver-tongued Julie Andrews recently admitted that she swears \u201ca lot\u201d \u2014 including on the set of the beloved Disney DIS, -0.52% family classic \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d\n\nRelated: The woman who sang \u2018A Spoonful of Sugar\u2019 admits to having a filthy mouth", "description": "Teigen called out the president\u2019s \u201c9th meltdown of the day\u201d in a pair of obscenity-laced tweets.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ927_trump__ZG_20190909102659.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
