The fervor is palpable, the congregation is in his thrall and raise their arms in prayer.\n\nAldana Masuco, 38, finds comfort here. \u201cWe have gone through other crises and God has never let us down,\u201d she said.\n\nThe vast majority of Evangelicals in Argentina and across Latin America are Pentecostals, a charismatic branch of Protestantism born in the United States at the beginning of the 20th Century.\n\n\u2013 Breaking through \u2013\n\nTheir breakthrough in Argentina dates to 2001, when the country experienced the worst economic crisis in its recent history.\n\n\u201cThe Evangelicals have a discourse that fits better with crisis, many of the faithful come through the social welfare network, finding work or comfort in the community,\u201d says Marcos Carbonelli of the University of Buenos Aires.\n\n\u201cThe political class knows this and uses it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe liberal government of center-right President Mauricio Macri turned to the churches in 2018 to help distribute food in the poorest districts of Buenos Aires.\n\nEvangelicals gained some ground here during the campaign against Argentina\u2019s bill to legalize abortion in 2018. The bill passed through the Chamber of Deputies, but was blocked by the Senate.\n\n\u201cPoliticians of all stripes come to us and ask us questions, and we receive them,\u201d says Pastor Ruben Proietti, head of the Christian Alliance of Evangelical Churches in Argentina (ACIERA), denying press reports of a close association with the Macri government.\n\nCarbonelli says Evangelicals have gained influence among \u201cpro-government politicians.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brazil-style political parties or leaders closely aligned to Evangelism are yet to emerge in Argentine politics.\n\n\u2013 Spiritual transformation \u2013\n\nPentecostals differ from Catholics because they don\u2019t pray to saints, recognize the Pope, or acknowledge the pre-eminent role of the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the focal point of their spiritual life, the cure for illness and the key to personal success.\n\nAt his church, Rey and another pastor place their hands on the heads of some members of the congregation who come forward at the end of the service. Some of them weep, others seem locked in a trance.\n\n\u201cI lived in bed, locked up, before I met God,\u201d says Evel Lorena, a 48-year-old woman in Rey\u2019s congregation.\n\nAt her side, her truck-driver husband, Alfredo Mendoza, recalled the \u201cdarkness\u201d of unemployment and how everything changed for the better. \u201cToday, I have a very good job, thank God.\u201d\n\nIn Buenos Aires, Evangelical churches are present in almost every neighborhood, and have even turned old cinemas into places of worship.\n\nThere are also thousands of so-called \u201ccells\u201d as the homes of members of the congregation are called, where small prayer gatherings are held under the guidance of a pastor.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, growth has accelerated,\u201d says Proietti.\n\n\u201cIn every neighborhood, there are more Evangelical churches than Catholic churches,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Aciera, more than 5,000 Evangelical churches are registered in Buenos Aires.\n\nThere are no official figures on the number of followers, but according to the organization, adherence to Evangelical worship has increased from eight percent of the population to 20 percent in the last decade.\n\nHowever Evangelical churches still don\u2019t have the same reach as in Brazil or Central America, where in some countries, Catholics are no longer in the majority.", "description": "Buenos Aires (AFP) \u2013 The pastor\u2019s voice bellows through an old converted cinema in a rundown Buenos Aires barrio and hundreds of hands reach", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/5484c8_followers-participate-in-religious-service-manantial-de-bendiciones-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
