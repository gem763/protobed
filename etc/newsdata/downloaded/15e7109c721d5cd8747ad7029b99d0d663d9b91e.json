Themed \u201cGirl, Find Your Voice,\u201d the partnership will offer Girl Scouts of Greater Atlanta members four GSMA Tech4Girls hands-on workshops between 2019 \u2013 2020.\n\n\u201cThe mobile industry wants to make a difference in gender inclusivity and partnering with the Girl Scouts will make careers in technology more approachable to young girls,\u201d said Ana Tavares-Lattibeaudiere\u2019s, Head of North America, GSMA. \u201cThese workshops give girls the confidence boost they need to pursue studies in STEAM fields.\u201d\n\nRecent studies confirm that job growth in the tech sector is three times higher than the U.S. national average. However, less than one in five tech jobs are currently held by women.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the GSMA\u2019s efforts in driving the mobile industry forward in addressing gender disparity in the sector,\u201d said Dr. Natoshia Anderson, STEM Program Manager of the Girl Scouts of Greater Atlanta. \u201cOur partnership with GSMA Tech4Girls is a natural fit with the Girl Scout\u2019s mission of building girls of courage, confidence and character who make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nThe first event of the year-long partnership took place on Saturday, October 12 in support of International Day of the Girl and was sponsored by Google. A total of 40 girls developed their own AI Voice Kits from Google, a voice recognition intelligence speaker.\n\nThe partnership will reach 150 Atlanta area participants and is a pilot program with potential adoption across the national Girl Scouts organization. Girl Scouts who complete each workshop will receive the \u201cThink like an Engineer Journey\u201d and newly designed \u201cGSMA Tech4Girls\u201d patches. The remaining three workshops will take place in March, May, August 2020.\n\nTech4Girls is part of the global GSMA\u2019s Women4Tech program, which focuses on reducing the persistent gender gap in the mobile industry, inspiring industry action for female leadership and workforce representation. Women4Tech supports the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, SDG 5: \u201cto achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.\u201d The program offers different touchpoints for women throughout their education and career journeys through dedicated initiatives, development and networking opportunities.\n\nUnder Tavares-Lattibeaudiere\u2019s leadership, GSMA North America launched Tech4Girls in 2018. Tech4Girls expanded globally in April 2019 with events across 11 countries in observance of International Girls in ICT Day.
