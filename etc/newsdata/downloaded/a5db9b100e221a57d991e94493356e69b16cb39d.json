The Republican president won more than 78% of the vote in Shelby County, which is on the west side of the state. Ohio is historically seen as a critical path for both Republicans and Democrats to win presidential elections.\n\n\"I'm out,\" Gibbs said.", "description": "\"I don't believe it until [the crops are] on the boat.
