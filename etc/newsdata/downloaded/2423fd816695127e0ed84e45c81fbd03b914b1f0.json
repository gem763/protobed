That\u2019s 41 cups per person, per annum. At 18g per cup, we create 18,000 tonnes of new, non-biodegradable trash each year. That\u2019s unconscionable, and there\u2019s little reason not to invest in a reusable cup if you\u2019re a habitual coffee drinker.\n\nBut the problem is much larger than that.\n\nI think that\u2019s what scares people most about Greta Thunberg. It\u2019s not her constant pleas for those in charge to believe the science, nor her vitriol for those who have \u201cstolen my dreams and my childhood\u201d through inaction.\n\nWhat terrifies people is her understanding that environmental destruction is the end point of unchecked capitalism, a system the planet embraced when factories first belched carbon into the atmosphere.\n\nThunberg\u2019s speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday has already been dissected into hashtaggable quips. \u201cHow dare you,\u201d uttered twice by the sixteen-year-old, has become a stand-in for her entire address. Yet those three words bookended the core of her speech, which is already lost to the noise.\n\n\u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth,\u201d she said.\n\nThat statement removed the onus of action from everyday people, like those who closed down cities last week to demand climate justice, and thrust it upon economic leaders and their enablers. That\u2019s where it belongs \u2013 far away from minuscule personal choices, like whether to use a Keep Cup or opt for a paper straw.\n\nEnsuring future generations do not inherit a burnt-out shithole will require a shift in what we produce and consume, and a change in who benefits from that production. That\u2019s a hop, skip, and a Marx from cups and straws, but Thunberg\u2019s comments stand in sharp relief to the idea that individual purchasing decisions will unfuck the planet.\n\nThere is a well-meaning logic to personal responsibility when it comes to consumption, and the average Australian still produces many times more waste and carbon emissions than most people around the world. But changing what products and services we use, without changing the conditions in which we make those choices, will guarantee we make the same mistakes.\n\nRemember those 18,000 tonnes of disposable coffee cups? Between 2016 and 2017, Australia\u2019s mineral processing and mining industries produced an estimated 30.6 million tonnes of waste. This is to say nothing of the carbon footprint left by mineral extraction, or the use of Australia\u2019s thermal coal in power stations.\n\nThe agriculture and fisheries sectors churned out an estimated 16.2 million tonnes of waste over the same time period (that\u2019s not to mention the full 6% of fishing nets and an astonishing 29% of fishing lines wind up as ocean waste each year). That same report, prepared for the Department of Environment and Energy, echoed Thunberg\u2019s claim in perfect clarity: \u201cGreater wealth results in more waste from renewal of material goods, infrastructure development and increased emphasis on convenience and time-saving.\u201d That kind of endless economic growth is, by definition, unsustainable.\n\nEvery culture war over plastic straws distracts consumers from seeking systemic change. Every time the fate of the planet is framed within an individual\u2019s purchasing decision, some fuckwit billionaire \u2013 who will be long dead when the first Water Wars roll around \u2013 slaps adds another comma on their net worth. Distraction is a business model. It\u2019s how we got here.\n\nThis is not to say we should abdicate personal responsibility. There is no reason for us to consume as voraciously as we do. But every time you lift a Keep Cup to your lips, there\u2019s probably someone glad you channelled your climate anxiety where it can\u2019t hurt them.\n\nThe targets of Thunberg\u2019s ire win every time you think defeating climate catastrophe comes down to a string of personal choices. How dare they.\n\nREAD MORE Morrison Channels Trump And Lays Into Young Climate Activists & The Media", "description": "Every war over individual choices distracts us from seeking systemic change.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/coffee-keepcup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
