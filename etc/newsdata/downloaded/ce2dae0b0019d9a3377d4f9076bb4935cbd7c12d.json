Both the president and Mr. Paul favor engagement, including with North Korea and Russia.\n\nThe fact remains that while Mr. Graham\u2019s friendship and Trump-whispering may well be the only thing standing between America\u2019s high-tailing it out of Kabul and staying put, it isn\u2019t indicative of a fundamental alignment \u2014 or a fundamental realignment \u2014 of foreign-policy views between the commander in chief and a guy from the John Bolton wing of the party.\n\nLucky for Mr. Paul. For years, the Republican Party wasn\u2019t buying what he was selling. But now, thanks to Mr. Trump, their friendship and Mr. Trump\u2019s natural instincts combined with his malleability, it\u2019s no longer Mr. Paul versus the entire party where Syria \u2014 or anywhere else \u2014 is concerned. Mr. Trump has mainstreamed Paulite thinking on America\u2019s international relations, whether you like it or not.\n\nMr. Paul\u2019s cultivated friendship with the president has paid dividends in other policy areas. Small-ball though it may seem, executive action on association health plans was something Mr. Paul sought, and got, from the president. And out of self-interest in the Russia investigation or not, Mr. Trump has also helped to mainstream within the Republican Party traditionally Paulite \u2014 and very much not Bushite or Cheneyish \u2014 concerns about government surveillance of its citizens (or in this case the Trump campaign).\n\nWill all this mean the end of \u201cendless wars\u201d? In fact, Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t seem quite as keen on getting out of Western Asia and the Arabian Peninsula wholesale as Mr. Paul would like.\n\nOn this, the president has actually united Mr. Paul and Mr. Graham in opposition. Take his decision last summer to sell billions of dollars of munitions to Saudi Arabia. Both senators opposed that action and were part of bipartisan legislation intended to block the arms sale.\n\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m voting with Senator Paul and others today is to send a signal to Saudi Arabia that if you act the way you\u2019re acting, there is no space for a strategic relationship,\u201d Mr. Graham said, referring to Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist killed in 2018. \u201cThere is no amount of oil you can produce that will get me and others to give you a pass on chopping somebody up in a consulate.\u201d", "description": "The sparring between these two senators and presidential allies is helping to shape conservative foreign policy.", "authors": ["Liz Mair"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/opinion/21Mair2/21Mair2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
