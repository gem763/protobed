The District does not. (Peter and Maria Hoey/for The Washington Post)\n\nTom Hogan and his wife Sheilah Lynch bought a historic estate in Easton, Md., in January. The Anchorage, a 12-acre property, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, in part because the Lloyds of Wye House, a prominent family in Maryland history, bought it in 1831.\n\nThe circa 1720 house also had a rotting foundation, outdated plumbing and electric systems and a 1970s-style kitchen.\n\nHogan, a D.C.-based lawyer, and Lynch, a plastic surgeon, decided to restore it to its former glory.\n\n\u201cIt was a very, very daunting, challenging proposition for anybody to want to buy this house because you knew you were going to have to do a lot of subsurface work behind the walls, basement, foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what frightened most people.\u201d\n\nTo help finance the restoration, the couple took advantage of a tax credit available through the Maryland Historical Trust. Marylanders can receive up to a 20 percent tax credit for eligible rehabilitation expenditures over a 24-month period. Each year, about 180 Maryland homeowners apply for the tax credit, said Elizabeth Hughes, director of the Maryland Historical Trust.\n\nMaryland is one of 35 states that offer state tax credits to incentivize the rehabilitation of historic buildings, according to a report prepared by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Virginia also has a Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit through its Department of Historic Resources, which offers a 25 percent tax credit on eligible rehabilitation expenses. The District does not offer a tax credit for restoring a historic property.\n\nSince the inception of the tax credit programs more than two decades ago, Maryland and Virginia have offered homeowners like Hogan an incentive to preserve and transform outdated, often rickety, houses into beautiful homes. Properties must be designated historic to meet eligibility requirements.\n\nHistoric tax credit programs also exist in local jurisdictions such as Frederick, Baltimore city and county and Prince George\u2019s County.\n\nMany people who live in historic neighborhoods want to preserve their homes because they like the history of the area, said Renee Kuhlman, the director of policy outreach at the National Trust.\n\n\u201cThey know that that is an important neighborhood to their past \u2014 to the community\u2019s past,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they want to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nArlington resident Greg Lawler, who lives in a historic district, read about Virginia\u2019s tax credit program in his neighborhood\u2019s newsletter after he purchased his 1930s house in 2006.\n\nThe tax credit gave Lawler a financial incentive to use historically appropriate materials on the exterior of his home.\n\nSome homeowners prefer historic materials because they last longer, Kuhlman said. Keeping a brass railing instead of installing a new one is more environmentally sustainable, she said.\n\nHughes explained how refundable tax credits work in Maryland, which is one of nine states that offer a refundable tax credit. If a homeowner owes $5,000 in state income taxes for the tax year that their project was completed and they receive a $10,000 tax credit for the renovation, then their tax liability in that year is \u201cextinguished,\u201d and they receive a refund check from the state for $5,000.\n\nThe homeowner benefits because they receive the cash right away, which can be put toward future rehabilitation work, Hughes said.\n\nVirginia does not offer a refundable tax credit. Instead, in most cases, the homeowner will apply their rehabilitation tax credit directly against their Virginia income tax liability. The credit may be carried forward 10 years.\n\n\u201cIf I earn a rehabilitation tax credit of $20,000 in 2019 and have a 2019 Virginia income tax liability of $5,000, then I will apply my tax credit against the liability, leaving a balance of $15,000 in tax credits,\u201d Elizabeth Tune, the director of the Preservation Incentives Division of Virginia\u2019s Department of Historic Resources, wrote in an email. \u201cI will then apply the remaining balance of tax credits against future Virginia income tax liability, until the credits are used up or for 10 years, which ever comes first.\u201d\n\nMaryland caps the tax credit at $50,000, based on a maximum of $250,000 in eligible expenditures in two years. Any expenses above $250,000 within that two-year period are not eligible for the tax credit. Most homeowner projects reviewed by the Trust cost between $40,000 to $50,000 on average, with credits typically between $8,000 to $10,000.\n\nIn Virginia, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $5 million in rehabilitation tax credits for any taxable year, Tune wrote.\n\nMaryland and Virginia employ three tax credit reviewers who review the proposed project\u2019s scope of work and specifications and, oftentimes, construction drawings to make sure the project meets federal historic preservation standards. Reviews can take from 30 to 45 days.\n\nProject details also need to be consistent with the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Rehabilitation, Hughes wrote. These federal standards, created by the National Park Service, are a guide to evaluating changes to historic resources.\n\nA few homeowners will use a private consultant to help them navigate the process when they have complex or large projects, but Hughes said her team offers technical assistance and advising.\n\nHomeowners need not do all the work at once. As long as the guidelines are met, they can make improvements over time as their cash flow allows, Hughes said.\n\nWhen construction is complete, homeowners must turn in photos of the completed project and a description of what they did, she said. Once it is approved, the refund is sent.\n\nA team from the Trust, which included a historic preservation officer, guided Hogan through the application process and walked the property with him.\n\n\u201cThey showed us \u2014 they literally physically showed us the forms and how to walk through them \u2014 what the timelines were,\u201d he said.\n\nHogan said he will use the funds over the course of his project, now in its early stages. He expects it will take five to seven years to complete all of the work. The Hogans can apply for the program again, as needed.\n\nDespite the work it will take to restore the house, he said he and his wife have already formed an emotional attachment to it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re owners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just feel like we\u2019re temporary stewards of a piece of history that we\u2019re going to try to improve and maintain and then hand off to somebody else.\u201d", "description": "Programs in Maryland and Virginia offer financial support to restore old houses.", "authors": ["Kristina Orrego", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-gPquJfBmgeorphg6oby24DUEVI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CNPAFWW5P4I6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
