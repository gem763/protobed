That's the first time we broke down together. We were in the house but had a lot of guests there.\n\n\"She didn\u2019t want to ruin their Christmas. That was the worst time we ever broke down together.\n\n\"She wanted to get through the Christmas so they put her on steroids. It really puffed her out. she was unrecognisable, because she was a fantastically gorgeous woman.\n\n\"She went on the steroids to get through the Christmas. I don\u2019t think if she knew but she kept getting us all together. She was in and out of pain but got through it brilliantly.\n\n\"When we got back she started booking for this Christmas. I think she knew she wasn\u2019t going to make this Christmas.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nTanya was treated at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles before living out her final days in the couple\u2019s Hollywood home.\n\nThe actor praised Cedars and Harefield Hospital in London, admitting he would never be able to repay them.\n\nOn hearing the news she was terminally ill, Vinnie said: \"As much as I was a b***er she felt safe with me. Until that final meeting in that room.\n\n\"I said one thing is important. She\u2019s not gong in no hospice. Kaley and I will look after her.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want her frightened. I said I didn\u2019t want her to know and I didn\u2019t want her to be in any pain.\"\n\nVinnie admitted he struggled to watch everyone go about their normal lives after 'the biggest tragedy of his life'.\n\nOn how he was coping, he said: \"Keeping busy. I think that's the first thing.\n\n\"I think you've got to get out there for other guys who are struggling. We've had some unbelievable emails and messages. it makes a difference. I didn't see that coming.\n\n\"Whenever you think you've got a problem, however hard it is, there is someone round the corner with bigger problems.\n\n\"I've got some great friends. Mine is not a celebrity list. It's people I grew up with around Watford, Hemel Hempstead and Bedmond. They're the people to turn to.\n\n\"The hardest part of it all for me to adjust to, even that day, everyone's life goes on.\n\n\"You're looking around. This is the biggest tragedy of your life. And people are still going to work and queuing up for Starbucks. The enormity of it all is hard.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nVinnie said Tanya was the \"opposite\" of feuding WAGs Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy, who have been embroiled in a public war of words.\n\nHe said: \"We had lots of other problems along the way. In a way moving to America was good as it kept everybody off our backs. You get more privacy. The minute you show up to the hospital here it's 'what's going on?'.\n\n\"The thing with Tans is, you look at the papers now with the two footballers' wives. Tanya got offered hundreds and hundreds to do modelling and stories.\n\n\"She did none of that. She\u2019s the opposite to the girls now.\n\n\"I think it's quite funny. But what about the embarrassment to the husbands? What about the kids?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nVinnie is going on X Factor : Celebrity as a tribute to his beloved wife, who was a big fan of the show.\n\nThe footballer-turned-actor, who played for Wimbledon, Leeds United and the Welsh national team, will join the celebrity version of the ITV singing contest in the coming weeks.\n\nHe said: \"Even the talk of the X Factor stuff. She loves the X Factor and it was her dream. Whether I do it or not it was her dream.\"\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers took to Twitter to praise Vinnie for bravely opening up.\n\nOne viewer said: \"The first interview I\u2019ve seen with a celebrity talking about his own experience of grief that really comes across as raw and real. Like so many of us who\u2019ve been through the same thing.\"\n\n\"Aww watching Vinny Jones.. life will get easier be assured remeber the happy memories you had with Tanya,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"My heart bleeds for Vinnie, what a legend, legend is battered around a lot but Vinnie is.. The memories won't keep you warm at night but they will be a light in your darkest days, chin up Vinnie you had a diamond of a wife... #Gmb.. Stay strong...\"\n\n\"The most candid real , moving interview I\u2019ve ever seen on breakfast tv @VinnieJones65,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nEarlier this month, Vinnie revealed the tragic but tender moment his wife slipped away in heartbreaking detail.\n\nSpeaking to the Sunday Mirror, shed tears but was also able to smile proudly as he revealed Tanya\u2019s courage and told of their precious final days in their Los Angeles home.\n\nVinnie gently kissed his soulmate, who was surrounded by her husband and five family members, and told her \u201cI love you, I love you.\u201d\n\nOver her final weeks, Vinnie would sleep in a room opposite to Tanya and they would blow each other kisses.\n\nRuling out ever falling in love again, he declared: \u201cShe was the light of my life. I will never be with anyone else.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\nSpeaking at Tanya\u2019s childhood home near Watford , Vinnie said: \u201cIn that last week of her life when the doctors said there were no more treatments,\n\n\"I never told her she was dying. We never spoke of that, I didn\u2019t want her to know.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut she kept saying \u2018take me home. Can I go home now?\u2019 She desperately wanted to go home.\n\n\"So did she know? Probably. In the hospital I slept there every night and Kaley would come every morning.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has never ever slept one night in hospital without me there. I have always been by her side.\n\n\"On the week of her death, the doctors said very nicely: \u2018These are your options, we don\u2019t know if it is going to be months or weeks\u2019.\n\n\u201cThrough my grief I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want her to be in any pain\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo we took her home. Straight away she was on the oxygen. Then she was on fentanyl. We got some beautiful innocent moments in those last days.\n\n\"She would try and get out of the patio windows or she would wake up and look and me and go: \u2018You... you know.\u2019 Some of the moments would make you laugh.\n\n\"These were very special moments.\u201d\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "The Hollywood actor and former footballer opened up in his first TV interview since Tanya died at the age of 53", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Getty Images", "Wireimage", "Tim Merry"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574898.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18480JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
