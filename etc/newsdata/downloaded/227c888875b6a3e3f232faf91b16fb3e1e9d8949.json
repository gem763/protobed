This is a plea for democracy,\" singer and activist Denise Ho told a hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.\n\nThe panel of witnesses also urged members of the commission, which includes senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties, to take actions that might affect Hong Kong's economy.\n\n\"Beijing should not have it both ways, reaping all the economic benefits of Hong Kong's standing in the world while eradicating our sociopolitical identity\" said Joshua Wong, secretary-general of Hong Kong's Demosisto party and leader of the \"Umbrella Movement.\"\n\nMembers of Congress at the hearing also pushed for a look at Hong Kong's special trade status.\n\n\"The United States and other nations have options precisely because Beijing benefits from Hong Kong's special status \u2014 a special status which has made Hong Kong an international financial center built on the promises that China made to the world with regards to Hong Kong, which they seek to break.\" said Senator Marco Rubio, the Republican co-chairman of the commission.\n\nThe former British colony has been rocked by more than three months of sometimes violent clashes, with demonstrators angry over what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in Hong Kong's affairs, despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system. China in 1997 promised to guarantee the freedoms for 50 years.\n\nThe trigger for the unrest was an extradition bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.\n\nLegislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate and House earlier this year that would require an annual review of the special treatment Washington gives Hong Kong, including trade and business privileges.\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would also make officials in China and Hong Kong, who have undermined the city's autonomy, vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nAnother bill introduced in the House last week with support from Republicans and Democrats, the \"PROTECT Hong Kong Act,\" would bar commercial exports of some crowd-control items to the Hong Kong police force.\n\nThe legislation has not come up for a vote, but the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees are both holding hearings this week expected to address relations with China on issues including Hong Kong.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has been waging a tit-for-tat tariff war with China for more than a year, has suggested China should \"humanely\" settle the problem before a trade deal is reached.\n\nSome industry groups worry that the legislation could threaten the delicate trade talks.\n\n\"Hopefully we will be able to pass some of this legislation to make it clear to the regime in Beijing that democracy is an important value,\" said Senator Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; additional reporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by Bernadette Baum and Leslie Adler)", "description": "Hong Kong democracy activists urged members of the U.S. Congress on Tuesday to pass legislation to combat human rights abuses in the city, rejecting any suggestion that such a move would be inappropriate U.S. involvement in another country's affairs.
