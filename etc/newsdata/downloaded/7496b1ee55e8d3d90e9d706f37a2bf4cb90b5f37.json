One loses track, because it just doesn\u2019t matter -- or at least it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I have a very romantic relationship with my world every day and the people who are in it.\"\n\nThe pair got romantically involved after wrapping Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1991, which Cameron initially asked Hamilton to come back for when she was pregnant with her son and married to Bruce Abbott. By the time the script was finalized, Hamilton was a mom to Dalton and in the process of getting a divorce from Abbott.\n\n\"Having been left, I just needed to get up on my feet and be strong and do nothing but mother my child and get ready for this film,\" Hamilton, who says the first Terminator film was \"hard on the psyche\" and left her fighting \"some depression,\" shares. \"You wake up all alone with your body and go, 'Hmm, these aren\u2019t hips anymore -- they\u2019re flanks.' To give myself permission to be that powerful, strong woman was necessary for my survival.\"\n\nAfter the success of the flick, Hamilton romantically connected with Cameron and quickly became pregnant with their daughter, Josephine.\n\n\"My answer to being that 'overnight success' was to go and get pregnant with Jim Cameron and completely disappear. What timing!\" Hamilton quips, before describing her relationship with Cameron as \"a mystery to all of us.\"\n\n\"That relationship was a mystery to all of us -- even Jim and myself -- because we are terribly mismatched,\" Hamilton, who speculates that Cameron fell in love with her Terminator character, Sarah Connor, says. \"I used to say we fit together like a puzzle: Everywhere he\u2019s convex, I\u2019m concave.\"\n\n\"I fell in love with her initially because I thought she was a little closer to Sarah than she actually is, but that doesn\u2019t mean that much once you get to know somebody,\" Cameron tells The Times. \"I think we were just in this high-velocity spiral around each other for a long time. We were fascinated by each other.\"\n\nThe end of that relationship, Hamilton says, left her \"completely devastated for years.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m so glad to be free of that,\" she notes. \"I would never, ever put that much energy again into something that is not working.\"\n\nLinda Hamilton and James Cameron Steve Granitz/WireImage More\n\nAs for her iconic role, which she's set to return to this year in Terminator: Dark Fate, Hamilton was initially uneasy to step into Sarah Connor's shoes once more.\n\n\"It\u2019s not that I was afraid to let the fans down. I was afraid to let Sarah Connor down,\" she remarks of her return, which she says she put in \"10 times the effort\" for in comparison to the second flick.\n\nAdditionally, Hamilton was uncertain if she wanted to give up her relatively spotlight-free life in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n\"That was my hesitation: Do I want to trade this lovely, authentic life for that?\" Hamilton says. \"I didn\u2019t want my neighbors looking at me differently. We\u2019re neighbors because of who we are, not what we do, and I don\u2019t want that to creep into my life again.\"", "description": "'It doesn't matter to me.'", "authors": ["Paige Gawley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KWz0B3ZHy.wU_iFcosRlIg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/360745f1deafae4e3bcde331b68bf30f"}
