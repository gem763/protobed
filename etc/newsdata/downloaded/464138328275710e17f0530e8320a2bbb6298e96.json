So did two of the mice in each of the other groups.\n\nThe team at NYU stress that further research is needed to know whether vaping leads to cancer in humans.\n\nHowever, they hope their findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, will encourage people to think twice before trying e-cigarettes, which are widely perceived to be a safer alternative to smoking.\n\n\u201cWe needed credible evidence to guide people in their choices, and it is unambiguous that nicotine alone will cause damage to the cells that make up organs, including lungs,\u201d said Tang.\n\n\u201cNow, we can try to find measures to prevent incidents of e-cigarettes causing cancer.\u201d\n\nIllnesses and deaths linked to vaping have continued to increase around the United States, with health officials claiming there have now been 1,080 cases and 19 deaths.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of illnesses several states have ordered bans on flavoured e-cigarettes.\n\nLast month, US president Donald Trump announced that he is considering a ban on all flavoured e-cigarettes, declaring that companies are getting rich while people die.\n\nDuring an appearance at the Oval Office, the president said that parents needed to be taught about what was happening.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to watch what we\u2019re saying and parents are going to be a lot tougher with respect to their children,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve become very rich companies very fast and the whole thing with vaping is it\u2019s very profitable. And I want companies \u2013 you know that \u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting with China. But we can\u2019t allow people to get sick.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t have our kids be so affected. And I\u2019m hearing it.\u201d\n\nA recent study of more than 12,000 16 to 19-year-olds found that vaping adverts were making e-cigarettes \u201cmore appealing\u201d to teenagers.\n\nWhile 40 per cent of participants said they spotted adverts on websites and in social media posts from celebrities, 38 per cent admitted the promotion made vaping products seem \u201cappealing\u201d.\n\nDr Sara Hitchman, lecturer in addictions at King\u2019s, said: \u201cOur study suggests that additional efforts are needed to limit the appeal of vaping product ads to youth.\"", "description": "New research on a small cohort of\u00a0mice has suggested that long-term exposure to vaping liquids that contain nicotine could increase the risk of cancer.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/09/vaping.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
