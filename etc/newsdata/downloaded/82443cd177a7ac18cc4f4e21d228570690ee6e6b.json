London, after all, has been Warsaw\u2019s strongest ally \u2014 and an advocate for the interests of non-euro members big and small.\n\nBut now, on the eve of Brexit, Poland\u2019s European star is suddenly rising \u2014 thanks to an unexpected partner: Germany.\n\nWhy? In Poland, a common saying goes: When you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about, it\u2019s about money. In this case, it\u2019s about Poland\u2019s booming economy.\n\nIn the first half of this year, Poland overtook the U.K. as Germany\u2019s biggest trading partner: Trade between the two rose by 6 percent in the first half of 2019, even as German trade with the U.K. dropped by 3.5 percent.\n\nFor the past three decades, Poland has consistently moved up the global prosperity ladder.\n\nThis reordering of the ranking is bringing about a deep political shift in Berlin, with big consequences for Poland \u2014 and for the EU.\n\nPoland\u2019s economic growth has been relentless. For the past three decades, the country has consistently moved up the global prosperity ladder, as it slowly closes the gap with the EU average.\n\nGermany \u2014 whose own economy is wobbling ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit \u2014 has taken note.\n\nIn a visit to Budapest in August, Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized Germany\u2019s cooperation with the Visegrad Group \u2014 the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia \u2014 adding that she hopes Brussels would continue to support them with EU budget subsidies.\n\nIn doing so, the German leader effectively downplayed concerns over democratic backsliding in the region \u2014 pushing back against calls by some EU politicians to cut off funds from countries, like Poland that don\u2019t respect the rule of law.\n\nIndeed, in Berlin the need to maintain good economic ties appears to be trumping concerns about breaches of the rule of law. And nowhere more so than when it comes to Poland, where there\u2019s a growing realization that the bigger the country, the greater the potential for backfire if Berlin tries to punish it.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable shift for a country that in less than half a decade has gone from model European to problem child.\n\nSince coming to power in 2015, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has acted antagonistically and schizophrenically on the EU stage. Warsaw has tried to block the reelection of Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, as president of the European Council. It stuck close the U.K. even after Brexit and has done much to test relations with neighboring Germany and France, another key strategic partner.\n\nBut recently, Warsaw seems to have changed tack, recognizing that, with the U.K. on its way out, it can\u2019t go on antagonizing Brussels \u2014 and more importantly, Berlin \u2014 or it will risk ending up completely isolated.\n\nThings took a turn toward reconciliation in March this year, when Poland\u2019s chief diplomat, Jacek Czaputowicz, shifted the government\u2019s foreign affairs priorities to mend ties with its European partners.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to nominate Szymon Sekowski vel S\u0119k \u2014 a vocal advocate for a stronger Berlin-Warsaw alliance who has high political ambitions \u2014 as its deputy foreign minister is another sign Warsaw is serious about taking steps in Germany\u2019s direction.\n\nPiS ministers also presented a host of new business initiatives in Berlin earlier this summer, which German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier praised as being in line with Berlin\u2019s Industry 4.0 plans. After the European election in May, the party threw its support behind Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nPoland\u2019s governing party may still be a pariah to the main political European families, and its efforts to undermine the judiciary are sure to continue ruffling feathers in Brussels and beyond.\n\nBut PiS has a trump card: Germany is increasingly aware of the net benefits to its economy of keeping up investments in Poland, including the EU\u2019s cohesion funds.\n\nA closer alliance with Poland could push Germany toward a more assertive foreign policy.\n\nThe new Polish-German rapprochement has implications that go far beyond the two countries\u2019 borders. In addition to shifting the balance of power within the EU, it has the potential to change Berlin\u2019s stance globally.\n\nA closer alliance with Poland could push Germany toward a more assertive foreign policy. When it comes to defense, the Poles have often argued that Berlin is punching below its weight \u2014 in marked contrast with a bipartisan commitment in Warsaw to defense spending and the transatlantic relationship.\n\nWith the Brits on the way out, Poland has realized that if it wants a stronger voice on the EU stage, it\u2019s in its best interest to shore up its relationship with Berlin.\n\nAnd with Berlin focused firmly on the economy \u2014 its most pressing concern at the moment \u2014 Warsaw has a real opening to do so.\n\nWojciech Przybylski is editor-in-chief of Visegrad/Insight and chairman of the Res Publica Foundation in Warsaw.", "description": "With the UK on the way out, Poland is leveraging its economic power into a closer alliance with Berlin.", "authors": ["Wojciech Przybylski", "Jan Cienski"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-657647884-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
