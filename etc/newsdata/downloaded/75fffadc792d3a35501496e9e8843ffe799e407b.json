Researchers have identified a new mechanism which suggests that the disease can develop in those with a fatty liver \u2014 even when their insulin levels are normal.\n\nA study at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland, suggests that type 2 diabetes can develop in those with a fatty liver \u2014 even when their insulin levels are normal. Stock picture of an insulin molecule\n\nThe liver \u2014 essential for regulating blood sugar levels, digesting food and getting rid of toxic substances \u2014 should store little or no fat.\n\nYet one in three Britons has a build-up of fat in the liver, a disorder known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This is common in those who are overweight or obese, but can also occur in slim people who carry fat around the organs in their abdomen (these people are sometimes known as TOFI, thin outside, fat inside).\n\nMost people with a fatty liver will not know they have it, as there are usually no symptoms (it\u2019s diagnosed through a blood test to check liver function).\n\nThe concern is that this can lead to more serious liver damage, heart and kidney disease, and is also a major risk factor for type 2.\n\nA Japanese study involving 2,400 patients, published in the journal Internal Medicine in 2017, found that 12.5 per cent of men with fatty liver disease in their 40s had developed type 2 diabetes ten years later, compared with 2.5 per cent who didn\u2019t have a fatty liver.\n\nIn women, the link was even stronger: 26 per cent of those with a fatty liver had type 2 after a decade compared with 1.8 per cent of those without.\n\nUntil now, it was thought that type 2 develops because patients are overweight or obese, which encourages insulin resistance.\n\nProfessor Pierre Maechler said: 'In patients with excess liver fat, fat serves as an energy source for glucose production, and this over-production of glucose could lead to type 2 diabetes, regardless of hormonal circuits.' Stock picture of a blood sugar monitor\n\nPart of the function of the liver is to produce glucose, essential for the functioning of the body and the brain, when sugar from food runs out \u2014 for example, during normal fasting periods such as when you sleep.\n\nNormally, it produces glucose when it is stimulated by the hormone glucagon. But for the first time, researchers have found that liver cells that have been \u2018energised\u2019 by fat can produce significant amounts of glucose of their own accord, without the need for a hormone to trigger it.\n\nThe theory that a fatty liver is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes is a \u2018novel re-reading of the origin of diabetes in overweight patients\u2019, say the researchers, whose study was published in July in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.\n\n\u2018In patients with excess liver fat, fat serves as an energy source for glucose production, and this over-production of glucose could lead to type 2 diabetes, regardless of hormonal circuits,\u2019 explains Pierre Maechler, a professor at the Diabetes Faculty Centre of the University of Geneva, who led the work.\n\nThe researchers came up with the new theory after focusing on a protein called OPA1, which maintains the structure of the mitochondria, or the \u2018batteries\u2019, in all cells.\n\nIn studies on mice, they found that OPA1 changed the structure in fatty liver cells, causing them to independently produce more glucose than the body needed.\n\nProfessor Maechler tells Good Health: \u2018These \u201csuper-mitochondria\u201d generated more energy than was necessary, which was used by the liver to produce extra sugar without any hormonal call.\u2019\n\nCommenting on the research, Emma Elvin, a senior clinical adviser at the charity Diabetes UK, says: \u2018Type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease often co-exist, and this paper delves into the details of exactly how too much fat in the liver might lead to type 2.\n\n\u2018As the research was carried out in mice, it\u2019s important we establish the connection \u2014 and any clinical implications \u2014 in people, before drawing conclusions.\u2019\n\nTo reduce the risk of both conditions, the charity recommends losing weight, if necessary, eating healthier foods and being more active each day.\n\nEmma Elvin adds: \u2018We know some specific foods are associated with a decreased risk of type 2; these include wholegrains, fruit and vegetables, yoghurt, cheese, tea and coffee.\u2019", "description": "A new study from the University of Geneva, in Switzerland, found having a fatty liver might be another cause of type 2 diabetes because it can produce glucose on its  own.", "authors": ["Rachel Ellis For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19709578-0-image-a-8_1571085352836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
