Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is organizing the conference.\n\nThousands of participants were expected to attend the stock-taking session on global climate action scheduled for Dec. 2-19 in Santiago. The UNFCCC is now exploring options to move the massive conference to an alternative host country, with barely a month to go.\n\n\"There have been past precedents of cases where the hosting country is not the same as the venue country. That could be the same in this case,\" UN spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters. He said he expected Chile would continue to serve as president of COP25.\n\nProtests in Chile began Oct. 18 over a 4-percent increase in subway fares in Santiago have spread across the nation, inflamed by the frustration of ordinary Chileans who feel they have been left out of the prosperity of Latin America's wealthiest country.\n\n", "description": "Chile Cancels APEC, COP25 Amid Ongoing Protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/31/2019103100605_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
