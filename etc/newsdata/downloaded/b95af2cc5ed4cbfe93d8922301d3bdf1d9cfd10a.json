Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe on March 16, 2018, just before his retirement was to begin, citing Horowitz\u2019s conclusions.\n\nClapper, now a strident Trump critic and who served as DNI from 2010 through 2017, was effusive in its praise of McCabe, calling him \u201csteady, straightforward, candid, forthright, and honest\u201d and claiming that the \u201cbiased scrutiny\u201d and the \u201cfirestorm of criticism\u201d against the embattled bureau deputy \u201ccompletely unjustified and profoundly unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope you will consider my observations, which I know are shared uniformly by virtually everyone who knows Andy, and will use your influential voice to ensure he is able to complete his career and retire after his 21 years of distinguished service to the bureau and this nation,\u201d Clapper wrote to Wray.\n\nClick here for more from Washington Examiner.", "description": "James Clapper, formerly the Director of National Intelligence, penned a glowing testimonial to FBI Director Christopher Wray in 2018 in an strenuous effort to save Andrew McCabe\u2019s job, calling the fired FBI deputy director a man of \"self-effacing humility\" and \u201cimpeccable integrity.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/30/694940094001_5778504883001_5778506040001-vs.jpg"}
