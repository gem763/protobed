He said the \"insolvent and bankrupt\" national carrier should be put into business rescue as soon as possible.\n\nA buyer should then be found to take it over,\n\nThe DA leader, flanked by the party's finance spokesperson Alf Lees, said SAA chair Dudu Myeni must be held accountable for her role in managing the airline. The DA would write to the Public Protector to investigate what role she had played in the \"institutional decay and poor governance\" of SAA.\n\nHe added that Myeni should be removed from the airline's board immediately.\n\nMaimane said the crisis at the airline was \"fast reaching boiling point\", with SAA's debt repayments of R6,9bn due this Saturday.\n\n\"Despite this urgent situation, National Treasury has yet to reveal where this enormous amount of money will come from,\" he said.\n\nSunday Deadline\n\nOn Wednesday Cabinet was meant to deliberate on how to save SAA from its latest cash crisis, after at least one creditor insisted it be paid by Saturday. The Treasury's director general Dondo Mogajane said Cabinet would offer possible solutions after the meeting on Wednesday.\n\nCabinet has not yet provided feedback.\n\nSAA has to pay back Citibank R1.8bn by Saturday September 30 as part of its debt obligations. As of Thursday, there were no indications that the US-based bank would grant the airline a reprieve.\n\nIn total SAA owes R6.9bn of debt that has to be paid by the end of the September. In July, the government had to provide it with R2.3bn from an emergency fund to pay what it owed to Standard Chartered, who had also refused to roll their debt over.\n\nMogajane previously said that, while the airline had R6.9bn of debt in total maturing at the end of the month, negotiations with lenders might lessen this amount, and give the airline room to breath.\n\n\n\nCitibank\u2019s debt needs to be paid on Saturday, however, and Wednesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting was meant to hash out where the money was going to come from.\n\nSAA recorded a loss of R1.5bn in the 2015/16 financial year, which rose to R4.7bn in 2016/17. It has already made a R1.3bn loss in the the current financial year to July.\n\nOn Thursday Maimane said that under Myeni, SAA has made a cumulative loss of R15.7bn over the past five years.\n\nTreasury, meanwhile, has previously estimated that the national carrier will need an estimated R13bn bailout over the next three years. Mogajane said Treasury\u2019s larger plan on how to recapitalise the cash-strapped airline would only be revealed during Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba\u2019s mini budget on October 25\n\nSAA, meanwhile, has already started cutting back on domestic routes in an effort to save money.\n\nR10bn bailout bill?\n\nTwo weeks ago Treasury drafted a special appropriation bill to recapitalise SAA with a R10bn bailout, which it hopes to table in a special parliamentary sitting.\n\nBut this option seems to have taken a backseat for now, as the finance ministry and Treasury try to hash out a solution for Saturday's payment deadline.\n\nMaimane said the R10bn bailout - if it goes ahead - would only provide a short term solution to the airline's funding woes.\n\n\"It will not provide working capital to fund the losses that National Treasury and the (airline's) latest turn-around plan indicate will continue for the next two years,\" he said.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE: Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.\n\nRead Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24\u2019s top stories", "description": "As SAA's R1.8bn debt repayment deadlines nears, the DA called on SAA chair Dudu Myeni to immediately step down, and the Public Protector to investigate Myeni's role in the national carrier's \"institutional decay\"", "authors": ["Yolandi Groenewald"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4248/17b5aba0a49d4052b4266beb4ec00dbf.jpg", "published_at": "2017-09-28"}
