If you applied this provision to Darwin in the NT, you wouldn't work one day in a year,' he told The Australian.\n\n'When we questioned the logic of limiting this provision to south-east Queensland if it was a genuine health and safety issue, the answer we were given was 'the workers \u00adoutside SEQ are more used to the higher temperatures and \u00adhumidity, therefore they are at less risk as they know how to manage it'.\n\nThe hot weather policy applies to workers on the Queen's Wharf development in Brisbane\n\nAnother senior industry figure accused the union of having a 'absolute stronghold' over the industry in Queensland.\n\nConstruction started on the Queen's Wharf development started this year with a major part of the project due to open in 2022.\n\nUnder an agreement between Multiplex and unions including the CFMEU, workers on the project can down tools work temporarily when the temperature reaches 28C and humidity is 75 per cent or higher three hours or more from work starting.\n\nWork will be modified to reduce the heat exposure by rescheduling 'hot tasks' to the cooler periods of the day, extra breaks, access to cool drinking water, ice machines, and fans and coolers, installation of shade cloths.\n\nThe agreement has been approved by the Fair Work Commission.\n\nThe hot weather policy implemented by many contractors in Queensland has been dubbed a 'health and safety nightmare'\n\nIn most other states, the hot weather policy applies when the temperature reaches 35C \u2014 irrespective of the humidity levels.\n\n'Once the temperature reaches 35C or a humidity level above 75 per cent, there will be an orderly cessation of work and preparations for safe completions of critical tasks currently underway,' a guide produced by the CFMEU states.\n\n'Work should be programmed in such a way as to reduce the risk of heat stress.\n\n'Sufficient numbers of workers should be engaged to allow rotation of workers in periods of heat.'\n\nA hot weather policy study published in the American Geophysical Union journal Earth's Future last year revealed that outdoor workers will need to start before the crack of dawn in the future to avoid excessive heat stress.\n\nThe study by researchers at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan found excessive heat stress reduces the capability of physical labor and leads to economic loss.", "description": "The Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union backed the policy in Queensland however critics have called it a 'health and safety nightmare', amid fears it will be exploited.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19541836-0-image-a-45_1570716057343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
