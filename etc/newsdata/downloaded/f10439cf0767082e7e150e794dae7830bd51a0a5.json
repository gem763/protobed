The company announced today that it won\u2019t allow such adsclaiming they don\u2019t fit \u201cthe TikTok platform experience.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s VP of global business solutions, Blake Chandlee, said the platform won\u2019t allow paid ads that promote a political agenda:\n\nTo that end, we will not allow paid ads that promote or oppose a candidate, current leader, political party or group, or issue at the federal, state, or local level \u2013 including election-related ads, advocacy ads, or issue ads.\n\nInterestingly, the app already had a similar policy for India before this year\u2019s assembly elections. Today\u2019s announcement is related to the US and Europe region.\n\nThis is quite a different approach as compared to US-based tech platforms such as Gooogle, Facebook, and Twitter. All of them allow paid political ads but with transparency programs that allow people to see who paid for the ad.\n\nWhile we won\u2019t see some hilarious attempts from politicians to connect with youth trough ironically funny videos, we might still see a lot of political content around. In this year\u2019s assembly elections in India, the platform made a significant impact in making the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi more popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK Prime Minister Boris Jhonson has joined Snapchat so people can see more of what he is doing.\n\nYour loss world. Political ads on TikTok would have been hilarious as candidates tried hard to be cool. Reminiscent of 2016 efforts by candidates on @Snapchat. https://t.co/53A8BIV83f \u2014 Lee C Dunn (@LeeCDinDC) October 3, 2019\n\nBanking on the app\u2019s popularity, the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) has roped in a TikTok celebrity to contest elections in the state of Haryana. Last month, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) became the first political party to have an officially verified account on the app.\n\nHowever, the company hasn\u2019t been untouched by political controversy. A report published by The Guardian last week suggests the app censors political content in China that doesn\u2019t fall in line with the country\u2019s government\u2019s purview. The app has also come under fire for censoring voices from the Hong Kong protest and pro-LGBT content in some countries.\n\nWhile the political ad ban may not solve all these problems on the platform, it shows intent from the company that it\u2019s not allowing money from political parties flow through the app.\n\nRead next: CHEAP: Get 32 inches of delight with this Dell 1440p monitor for just $180", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F04%2FTikTok-Court.jpg&signature=b94a4db6dfe17e4e6a5779d69838a5ba", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
