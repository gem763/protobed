He denied all charges in that case in a statement on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Emma Pinedo and Isla Binnie; Editing by Ingrid Melander and Jan Harvey)", "description": "Spain's High Court will investigate whether Russian tycoon Mikhail Fridman deliberately acted to depress the share price of struggling supermarket chain DIA  in his bid to take control of the group, a court document seen by Reuters showed.
