Like others who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, they were not authorized to discuss the testimony.\n\n\"I was disturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,\" McKinley testified, according to a former colleague familiar with his remarks.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry revolves around a whistleblower's complaint that U.S. President Donald Trump was pushing Ukraine's leader into opening an investigation of a company connected to the son of Trump's potential 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden. It is illegal to solicit or receive foreign help in a U.S. election.\n\nU.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, says although his family has helped him get opportunities, he denies any unethical behaviour engaging in foreign work in Ukraine and China. 1:47\n\nAmong McKinley's concerns was the administration's failure to support Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in March on orders from Trump.\n\nMcKinley, who as a Latin America expert was not specifically involved in Ukraine, was also frustrated that there had been no response to an August inspector general's report that found significant evidence of leadership and management problems, including allegations from career employees that Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley and his former senior adviser Mari Stull retaliated or tried to retaliate against them as holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nMcKinley concerned for ambassador\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows told reporters outside the closed-door hearing that McKinley was complimentary about Pompeo's role but did raise other issues.\n\n\"I think most of this is a concern by a colleague for an ambassador that he held in high regard,\" Meadows said, declining to provide more details on the session.\n\nRepublicans are crying foul over the process of the impeachment inquiry, but as House Democrats press on with the investigation, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell briefed Republicans about a possible House impeachment vote by Thanksgiving that would force a trial in the Senate, likely by Christmas. He used slides and history lessons during a private Senate Republican lunch in the Capitol to talk about the process, according to a person familiar with the meeting.\n\nNorth Carolina Rep.

(Andrew Harnik/The Associated Press)\n\nAt the White House, congressional leaders abruptly ended an explosive meeting with the president on the situation in Syria, when Trump called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \"third-rate politician,\" according to Democrats. Pelosi said later the president was having a \"meltdown.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he knows his House colleagues didn't run for office to conduct an impeachment investigation, but \"the facts that are already in the public domain are so deeply troubling and must be taken very seriously.\"\n\nAnother key figure in the impeachment investigation, special envoy Kurt Volker, returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to review the transcript of his Oct. 3 testimony to investigators, according to a person familiar with his appearance.\n\nVolker provided text messages to lawmakers that revealed an effort at the State Department to push Ukraine's leader into opening an investigation of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, connected to Joe Biden's son, in return for a visit with Trump.\n\nThat effort soon escalated into what one diplomat feared was a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid. Trump has denied that, saying assistance to Ukraine was delayed to pressure the country into addressing corruption.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine testified in the Trump impeachment inquiry that there had been \"a concerted campaign\" to remove her from her post. 2:02\n\nAnother ambassador involved in those text message exchanges, Gordon Sondland, has been asked to appear Thursday.\n\nThe testimony so far from the witnesses, mainly officials from the State Department and other foreign policy posts, is largely corroborating the account of the government whistleblower, whose complaint first sparked the impeachment inquiry, according to lawmakers attending the closed-door interviews.\n\nOne witness said it appeared \"three amigos\" tied to the White House \u2014 Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 had taken over foreign policy. Another quoted former national security adviser John Bolton as calling Giuliani a \"hand grenade\" for his back-channel efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThis is not a game for us. This is deadly serious. We're on \u2026 a path to the truth. - Nancy Pelosi, Democratic House Speaker\n\nTrump's July 25 phone call in which he pressed Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden's family is at the centre of the Democrats' inquiry.\n\nPelosi, despite intensifying calls from Trump and Republicans to hold a formal vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry, showed no indication she would do so. She said Congress will continue its investigation as part of the constitution's system of checks and balances of the executive.\n\n\"This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious. We're on \u2026 a path to the truth,\" Pelosi told reporters after a closed-door session with House Democrats.\n\nTrump calls the impeachment inquiry an \"illegitimate process\" and is blocking officials from co-operating.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are bracing for a vote and trial. House Republican whip Steve Scalise invited Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was an impeachment manager decades ago during former president Bill Clinton's impeachment, to brief Republican lawmakers on the process ahead.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the intelligence committee overseeing the probe, has praised State Department officials for stepping forward, under subpoena, to shed light on the matter.\n\n\"We have learned much of this thanks to the courageous testimony of the State Department officials who have been put in an impossible situation by the administration,\" which is urging them not to comply with requests to testify to Congress, he said. \"They are doing their duty.\"", "description": "A\u00a0swift-moving impeachment probe pushed onward Wednesday as a former top State Department aide testified that the Trump administration's politicization of foreign policy contributed to his resignation, while the Senate Republican leader briefed colleagues on a possible Christmas impeachment trial.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323599.1571261703!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/michael-mckinley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
