He\u2019ll benefit from the many legit weapons at his disposal, which this version of Newton simply couldn\u2019t properly utilize.\n\nStills has overtaken Keke Coutee as Houston\u2019s slot receiver, where he\u2019s leading the NFL in yards per route run by a mile (minimum 50 routes). Stills is a sleeper this week for those in deeper leagues.\n\nCleveland Browns @ Baltimore Ravens\n\nSit: Baker Mayfield\n\nStart: Marquise Brown\n\nThanks in part to poor coaching and suboptimal offensive line play, Mayfield has been one of the season\u2019s biggest busts (Daniel Jones nearly has as many fantasy points), as he ranks last in Positive Percentage throws according to Sports Info Solutions (among QBs who\u2019ve attempted at least 100 passes this season). He now gets a tough Baltimore defense on the road with Marlon Humphrey (who\u2019s ceded a minuscule 0.20 fantasy points per route) locked onto favorite target Odell Beckham Jr., and David Njoku out.\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $400K Baller. $10 entry fee and $50K to first place]\n\nCleveland corners Denzel Ward and Greedy Williams might be out, so fire up Brown with confidence despite last week\u2019s disappointing box score. The rookie saw nine targets and had the second-most air yards in the league, so he\u2019s a top-15 WR on my board against the injury-ravaged Browns secondary.\n\nWashington Redskins @ New York Giants\n\nStart: Paul Richardson, Wayne Gallman\n\nStory continues\n\nRichardson has scored in back-to-back weeks and even saw nine targets last game, and he\u2019s set to face off against rookie DeAndre Baker, who\u2019s allowed the most fantasy points per route this season. The Giants have been exploited for an NFL-high 10.5 YPA and have ceded the second-most fantasy points to wideouts. Richardson would go from intriguing flier to WR2 territory if Terry McLaurin has to sit out (he was a late-week addition to the injury report).\n\nGallman is obviously a big downgrade in talent, but he took all of the snaps after Saquon Barkley left last week\u2019s game, and he enters Week 4 as New York\u2019s clear lead back with Elijhaa Penny the only other RB on the roster. Gallman reportedly struggled with drops during summer but saw 48 targets in limited work as a rookie in 2017, so there\u2019s PPR appeal, and the Giants have an improved offensive line that\u2019s only getting better.\n\nMost importantly, New York\u2019s offense is now interesting with Daniel Jones looking like a major upgrade at QB, and Gallman gets a favorable matchup right away. Both teams are top-five in pace and Washington comes in with the No. 25 ranked run defense DVOA, as this game features one of the highest totals of the week. Gallman was the starting RB for Clemson\u2019s national championship team in 2016, and he\u2019s now suddenly a feature back on a team led by Danny Dimes up against one of the league\u2019s worst defenses, yet he\u2019s the minimum $10 in Yahoo DFS this week.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Miami Dolphins\n\nSit: Kenyan Drake\n\nI originally included Justin Jackson as a \"Start\" here, but it should be noted Jackson (who leads the NFL in YPC after contact) was added to the injury report Thursday, and was ruled out of Week 4 on Friday. He would've been this week\u2019s backup RB to see extended work in clock-kill mode for a team heavily favored against a Miami defense that\u2019s been gashed for the most fantasy points by running backs. With Jackson sitting out, Austin Ekeler might get all the touches he can handle in this highly favorable matchup and with Melvin Gordon returning to action from his holdout next week..\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago Drake set the record for best YPC after contact, but he lost a fumble last week and continues to be graded as one of the worst blocking running backs. Tanking Miami has a dire situation along its offensive line, and it\u2019s tough recommending players from a team that\u2019s a 16.5-point underdog while at home against a squad with a losing record.\n\nOakland Raiders @ Indianapolis Colts\n\nStart: Tyrell Williams\n\nStart in DFS: Marlon Mack ($24)\n\nWilliams was invisible until a garbage-time TD late last week, but he gets a better matchup Sunday, ranks top-20 in air yards this year and should see a lot of coverage from struggling rookie, Rock Ya-Sin.\n\nThe Colts enter with arguably the biggest advantage up front this week, an implied team total of 26 points and a hobbled T.Y. Hilton against the league\u2019s 29th ranked defense DVOA. Mack continues to quietly be more involved as a receiver (he\u2019s running more routes than his reception numbers may suggest) and should be considered a top-five RB in Week 4.\n\nConsider Marlon Mack a top-five option this week. (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)\n\nKansas City Chiefs @ Detroit Lions\n\nStart: Mecole Hardman\n\nStart in DFS: Kerryon Johnson ($19)\n\nThe inconsistent Sammy Watkins should see a lot of Darius Slay coverage, while the speedy Hardman should have fun playing catch with Patrick Mahomes during the QB\u2019s first NFL game in a dome stadium (with Tyreek Hill still out and a banged-up rushing attack).\n\nJohnson saw a big increase in usage without C.J. Anderson last week, and while the YPC remains ugly (in part thanks to seeing a big increase in stacked boxes compared to last season), that should improve against a Chiefs defense that ranks last in run defense DVOA (just like last season) and is allowing a league-high 6.2 YPC (next worst is 5.4). The Lions may even be forced to play quicker trying to keep up with KC\u2019s offense during this game that features the week\u2019s highest total (55 points), making Johnson a top-10 RB option.\n\nNew England Patriots @ Buffalo Bills\n\nSit: Tom Brady, John Brown\n\nBrady\u2019s off to a terrific start, but Julian Edelman is banged up, Antonio Brown was released, and he\u2019s on the road against a stingy Buffalo secondary that yielded the fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks last season (and sixth-fewest this year). Brady is more of a QB2 this week.\n\nBrown has a positive outlook moving forward but faces a tough task Sunday against shadow corner Stephon Gilmore, so you\u2019ll want him on your bench in Week 4.\n\nTennessee Titans @ Atlanta Falcons\n\nSit: Marcus Mariota\n\nStart in DFS: Julio Jones ($38)\n\nIt\u2019s tough recommending anyone in the Titans passing game outside of Delanie Walker, and Mariota continues to hold the ball too long without attacking downfield. He\u2019s in real danger of getting benched at some point this season.\n\nJones has scored 12 touchdowns over his last 12 games and this week gets Malcolm Butler and company, who\u2019ve yielded the fourth-most fantasy points to his primary side this season. Jones is the No. 1 WR this week and worth paying up for in DFS.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers @ Los Angeles Rams\n\nSit: Jameis Winston\n\nStart: Jared Goff\n\nWinston committed 12 turnovers in six road games last year, has a banged-up Chris Godwin\u2019s availability in question and gets a Rams defense that\u2019s allowed the second-fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks.\n\nGoff sports a 23:3 TD:INT ratio with a 9.1 YPA mark over nine games at home since the start of last season and faces a Bucs funnel defense that sports the No. 2 ranked run defense DVOA (and yielding the fewest fantasy points to running backs this season), yet is beatable through the air.\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ Arizona Cardinals\n\nStart: Will Dissly, Christian Kirk\n\nDissly is up to three touchdowns on the year already and gets the league\u2019s most inviting defense against tight ends. In fact, the difference between the Cardinals and the team with the second-most fantasy points allowed per game to tight ends is greater than No. 2 and No. 29. Dissly is a borderline top-five tight end option this week for the suddenly pass-happy Seahawks.\n\nKirk is still searching for his first touchdown, but his 32 targets tie him for fifth in the NFL, and Arizona continues to lead the league in pace (overall and in neutral situations). Moreover, Seattle\u2019s once-vaunted secondary has ceded a 100.4 Passer Rating this season.\n\nMinnesota Vikings @ Chicago Bears\n\nSit: Stefon Diggs, David Montgomery\n\nDiggs won\u2019t be this bad all season (just six catches through three games), but Minnesota\u2019s run-heavy strategy is really killing his fantasy value, and he gets a Chicago secondary that\u2019s limited receivers on his primary side to the second-fewest fantasy points this season.\n\nMontgomery has emerged as Chicago\u2019s clear lead back, although that hasn\u2019t resulted in a ton of fantasy value yet, and while Mitch Trubisky plays better at home, Sunday\u2019s matchup won\u2019t be easy against a tough Minnesota defense.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars @ Denver Broncos\n\nSit: D.J. Chark\n\nStart: Phillip Lindsay\n\nChark has opened the season scoring in all three games and looks like a favorite of Gardner Minshew, but he\u2019ll be locked up against Chris Harris this week in a game with weather that could wreak havoc on the passing attack, with gusts possibly reaching 40 mph.\n\nThis windy matchup should heavily feature the run, and Lindsay faces a Jaguars defense that\u2019s ranked No. 26 in rush defense DVOA. He\u2019s tied for the NFL lead with five carries inside the five-yard line this season, while Royce Freeman has been limited in practice and is hobbled by a shoulder injury.\n\nDallas Cowboys @ New Orleans Saints\n\nStart: Devin Smith\n\nSit in DFS: Michael Thomas ($30)\n\nAmari Cooper looks likely to go but will be playing at less than 100% while Michael Gallup remains sidelined, and the exciting Smith gets a New Orleans secondary that\u2019s been shredded for 8.9 YPA while allowing the second-most fantasy points to his primary side.\n\nThomas is slated to be shadowed by Byron Jones and is going to suffer from having a struggling Teddy Bridgewater throwing to him. He\u2019s not someone to consider paying up for this week in DFS and expectations should be held in check in season-long leagues.\n\nCincinnati Bengals @ Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nSit: John Ross\n\nStart in DFS: James Conner ($28)\n\nRoss is having a nice breakout season, but Cincinnati\u2019s offense Monday night is likely to flow through Tyler Boyd, as Pittsburgh has been the most vulnerable team in football to the slot this season. Meanwhile, Ross will be frequently lined up across Joe Haden, who\u2019s allowed just 0.22 fantasy points per route.\n\nWhile you\u2019re fading Michael Thomas in the SNF/MNF slate, you can spend it on Conner, who\u2019s struggled mightily this year but faces a Bengals front seven that\u2019s allowed the second-most fantasy points to running backs this season (and the Dolphins almost shouldn\u2019t count).\n\nFollow the Yahoo fantasy football crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams\n\nListen To The Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Dalton Del Don looks at every Week 4 game and offers his lineup advice, and he thinks Marlon Mack is a top-five option this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0TQWnZRWIroCgf4VNpNvNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SCYmJm6tsOJ5b_kIOLt5uQ--~B/aD0yNzA2O3c9NDA1OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/cf91ac40-e14e-11e9-affa-5f4413f7deb2", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
