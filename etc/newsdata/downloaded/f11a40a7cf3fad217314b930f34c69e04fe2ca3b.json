The poles were clean cut, making it pretty clear that this was a deliberate attack.\n\nEmergency crews were alerted to the crime after residents reported mass power outages, obviously because this guy decided to just ruin everyone\u2019s weekend.\n\nTwo chainsaws were later found nearby, confirming authorities\u2019 initial suspicion.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t state enough just how dangerous and irresponsible this behaviour is,\u201d Ausgrid Chief Operating Officer Trevor Armstrong said.\n\nIn the midst of wild weather and actual problems that required emergency assistance, Ausgrid crews had to go and deal with this mess that should\u2019ve never been an issue.\n\n\u201cIt is the height of stupidity to cut down a power pole carrying live powerlines, we are incredibly lucky nobody was killed or seriously injured,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph, the poles were chopped down in an attempt to harvest the expensive copper wire used in power lines.\n\nI\u2019m no power expert but cutting down a power pole sounds like a surefire way to get yourself electrocuted.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly disappointing we need to spend resources on fixing unnecessary and criminal damage like this, especially on a weekend when our emergency crews were already busy responding to wind damage,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nThe incident has been referred to police for further investigation. Anyone with information regarding the matter should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\n\nIf you want to be a lumberjack, go find some firewood to chop up, not the damn power poles. This is very dangerous, please do not try this at home.\n\nREAD MORE Shit Yourself For Cheap Atop The Sydney Harbour Bridge For Under $100 Next Month", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pjimage-22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
