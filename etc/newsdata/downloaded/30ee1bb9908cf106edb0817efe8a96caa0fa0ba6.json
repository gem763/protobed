The book includes smartphone-friendly QR codes to watch sign language videos.\n\n\"We want more people to use the book so they can use international sign. There is really a shortage of interpreters and instructors out there, so we want to make efforts to train as many as possible,\" said JFD Director Sachiyo Yoshino.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "As the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics draw ever closer, more people in Japan are taking courses in international sign language as a means of communicating with hearing-impaired visitors from overseas.
