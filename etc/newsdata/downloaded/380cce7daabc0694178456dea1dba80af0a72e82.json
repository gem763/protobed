We'll try and keep them quiet by playing good football. We trust UEFA and hopefully it's a celebration of good football.'\n\nThe 30,000-capacity stadium is sold out for United's first appearance in Serbia since 1966, and second since the Munich Air Disaster as they returned home from a European Cup quarter-final against Red Star Belgrade eight years earlier.\n\nThe Football Against Racism in Europe network, who operate with UEFA to report incidents of discrimination, are on high alert for the game. They provided a higher number of spotters for England's game in Bulgaria and could do so again.\n\nMaguire sat next to Solskjaer on Wednesday and for the second week running found himself discussing the threat of racism.\n\nHe said: 'We will trust UEFA to follow their protocol with the three steps. Obviously Sofia was a sickening atmosphere, and it is something I don't want to be part of again.\n\n'We're positive tomorrow [Thursday] night will be a great atmosphere, one we're all looking forward to playing in.\n\n'If something does goes off then we'll follow the three-step protocol and I'm sure there will be people on and off the pitch doing their bit to make things better for the future.'\n\nUnited face Partizan Belgrade - who were recently punished for racist chanting - on Thursday\n\nPREDICTED TEAMS PARTIZAN BELGRADE (4-4-2): Stojkovic; Miletic, Ostojic, Pavlovic, Urosevic; Scekic, Natcho, Zdjelar, Tosic; Sadiq, Asano MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Romero; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Rojo, Williams; Fred, McTominay, Mata, Lingard, Greenwood; Rashford\n\nPartizan have appealed to their fans to behave to avoid any further punishment from UEFA. An additional problem for the Serbian club is that three separate factions of their supporters \u2014 The Gravediggers, The Forbidden and The South Stand \u2014 have been fighting among themselves for some time.\n\nA club statement read: 'Cheerfully and sportily, without discriminatory, chauvinistic, fascist or other outbursts, do not chant opponents on a national basis, do not express outbursts of hatred and hatred towards players of the opposing team.\n\n'Any such situation, call or chanting can lead to serious consequences and sanctions by the UEFA Disciplinary Board.'\n\nTheir manager, former Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic, also spoke out about the issue when he appeared before the media on Wednesday.\n\nMilosevic said: 'First of all, I expect everything to be fair and in the spirit of the sport. We know of our supporters, we are aware of the importance of the game and we are also aware of the problems we have had in the past.\n\n'But Thursday will once again be a celebration of football, so I don't expect any problems in that regard. We all know how important the support from the home fans can be.'\n\nUnited have had problems of their own after handing an indefinite ban to a supporter who was thrown out of Old Trafford for racially abusing Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold on Sunday.\n\n'I'm happy the club have identified, what do you want to call him,' said Solskjaer. 'It's something we feel strongly about and are going to stamp down on as much as we can.'\n\nThe United boss has ruled Paul Pogba out of Sunday's trip to Norwich as he recovers from an ankle injury, but said that Luke Shaw and Nemanja Matic will be assessed when they return from warm-weather rehab in Dubai at the end of the week.", "description": "Harry Maguire\u00a0 and Marcus Rashford have spoken to their Manchester United teammates about how to handle racist abuse if they encounter it against Partizan Belgrade.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/19/20096174-0-image-a-37_1571854023255.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
