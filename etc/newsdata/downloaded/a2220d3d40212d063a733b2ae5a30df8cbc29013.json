Our boys played with a totally negative mindset. There was no planning at all,\u201d Raja said.\n\nThe veteran of 57 Tests and 198 ODIs criticized head coach Misbah-ul-Haq and company for once again giving chance to those players who have already been tested for so many times.\n\n\u201cYou have to move on, it is T20I cricket and you need to play with the young mindsets. For me, compromising with old players won\u2019t give them any room to improve their performance,\u201d he highlighted.\n\nThe cricketer-turned renowned commentator adviced the think tank to do something as early as possible because the ICC T20 World Cup is just around the corner. \u201cJust after seven to eight matches, they have to participate in the T20 World Cup but with this strategy, they will face immense problems there in Australia,\u201d he concluded.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Pakistan's former Test cricketer Ramiz Raja opined that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) should appoint a separate coach for the national team for T20I format.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Raja.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
