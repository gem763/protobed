That is already happening with the stories about Mr. Morrison. This means that no foreign leader can have the expectation that anything he tells Mr. Trump, or the next President, will be confidential.\n\nThe first leak of a Trump phone call came in his first days in office after he spoke with previous Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Then his call to Mexico\u2019s President was leaked. The White House then decided to protect the secrecy of those calls by putting them onto a separate system, which seems justified given the leaks. Yet now this too is said to be part of the coverup.\n\nOnce again we see the irony that in the rush to impeach Mr. Trump for his real or imagined violations of political norms, his opponents have no problem violating norms themselves.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
