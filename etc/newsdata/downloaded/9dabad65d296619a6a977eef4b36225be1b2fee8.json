It's starting weight is 4,650 pounds.\n\nIf you drive a sedan, an older model car or even a pickup from the \u201890s, once you get into heavy traffic, one thing becomes abundantly clear: pickup trucks these days seem \u2014 to use the technical term \u2014 really freaking big.\n\nNo, you\u2019re not going crazy. It actually plays out in the data. Last week, we came across a chart from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, tweeted out by the director of Infrastructure Policy at the Center for American Progress, showing a 32% increase in the average weight of pickup trucks between 1990 and 2018.\n\nNo, you're not imagining things. Pickup trucks have gotten a lot bigger in recent years. Since 1990, the average weight of pickups has increased by 1,256 lbs or 32%.

But the big question is, simply, why is this happening?\n\n\n\nTo answer that, we called up Dan Edmunds, Director of Vehicle Evaluation at Edmunds.com [the identical name is just a coincidence], who tags the constant growth with three main points, and one you may not expect.\n\nThe Switch From Imports to American Models\n\n\u201cIn the \u201890s, I worked for Toyota Technical Center in Arizona and I was involved in truck development, so T100, first Tacoma, first Tundra, so I\u2019ve been through that and I see what it is now,\u201d Edmunds told InsideHook. Before then, going back to the 1970s, a lot of the trucks on the roads were whatever automakers were selling globally. \u201cEven the Toyota Hilux, which is what Marty McFly wants in Back to the Future, that was still an imported truck.\u201d\n\nThen the Toyota Tacoma came along in 1995, which Edmunds notes was the first pickup Toyota designed for the U.S. market. By following the lifespan of that truck, you can get a good look at the pickup industry as a whole: \u201cWe\u2019re in the third generation now, but in 2005 [when the second generation launched], that\u2019s where the Tacoma got bigger. It went from compact to midsize. This is industry-wide, everybody seemed to do that at about the same time \u2026 What was going on in trucks generally was they were moving from regular cabs to extended cabs to crew cabs.\u201d\n\nThe Supremacy of the Crew Cab\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with truck lingo, a crew cab is a pickup with four front-hinged doors and two rows of seats, as opposed to the older standard of a two-door regular cab. Edmunds illustrates the watershed crew cab moment like this: previously when you went to a dealer to buy a pickup, they\u2019d show you the regular cab and flippantly mention the crew cab. Starting in the aughts, the car salespeople started showing the larger trucks first.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all on the dealers and automakers. \u201cWhen crew cabs became available on something like an F-150 or a Tacoma, suddenly people were buying them for more family use,\u201d Edmunds said. \u201cThen once you do that, it\u2019s like, well it\u2019d be nice to have a little more legroom. So in more recent times, RAM and Chevy and everybody has extended their wheelbase to make the rear seat even more pleasant.\u201d\n\nThat transition from work vehicles to personal vehicles had a ripple effect, with half-ton and heavy-duty trucks getting bigger and more powerful in step with the lighter duty trucks. \u201cAlmost instantly, the crew cab became the number-one selling configuration,\u201d he said. \u201cSo then the whole design philosophy started to change around the crew cab.\u201d\n\nObama-Era Fuel Regulations\n\nMore or less, all of this makes a lot of sense. Americans like using pickups for personal use, and once we get a little taste of something we like, we want, as Tim Taylor said, more power. But when Barack Obama became president and we as country started to have conversations about fuel economy, wouldn\u2019t we have seen a decrease in the size of trucks? Actually, it was the opposite.\n\nIn the Obama era, Edmunds explained, fuel economy regulations \u201cchanged from just a straight average across the board to what\u2019s called a platform-based fuel economy standard. So your fuel economy target for a given vehicle is based on its wheelbase and its tread width, which is the width between the tires left to right. So if you multiply that you find the area of that rectangle and there\u2019s a table that shows what your fuel-economy target is. The bigger the vehicle, the smaller the target.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the regulations put in place to get better mileage out of vehicles also led to an increase in truck size. \u201cThere was kind of an incentive to maybe stretch the wheelbase a couple of inches and set the tires maybe an inch further apart, because you get a bigger platform and slightly smaller target,\u201d said Edmunds. \u201cNow, the bigger vehicle would be heavier and might use more fuel, so it\u2019s not as easy as just doing that. But certainly there was a feeling that if they did need to make it bigger to accommodate more passengers, the fuel economy target wouldn\u2019t be onerous. They could do it.\u201d\n\nIn the end, those standards also mean \u2014 unfortunately for people like the Twitter commenter who bemoaned the Tacoma\u2019s size increase \u2014 that we probably won\u2019t see a return to true compact pickup trucks. But what about electric trucks? Isn\u2019t there a possibility that we\u2019ll see smaller EV pickups once those finally start hitting the market?\n\n\u201cOh, certainly,\u201d said Edmunds. When it comes to electric vehicles, while the technology isn\u2019t there yet, he had two words: \u201cAnything\u2019s possible.\u201d", "description": "Data shows the average weight of pickup trucks in America increased 32% (or 1,256 pounds) between 1990 and 2018.
