XRP price must break $0.3100 to accelerate higher.\n\nRipple Price Analysis\n\nIn the past three sessions, there was a steady rise in ripple above the $0.2850 and $0.2880 resistance levels against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP/USD climbed above the $0.3000 resistance levels and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nThere was a spike above the $0.3060 level and the recent swing high was formed near the $0.3065 level. At the moment, the price is correcting lower below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2930 low to $0.3065 high.\n\nAn immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3000 area. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2930 low to $0.3065 high.\n\nAdditionally, there is a major rising channel forming with support near $0.2990 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. More importantly, the 100 hourly SMA is near the $0.2980 area to provide support.\n\nTherefore, a downside break below the $0.2980 support might start an extended correction. The next major support is near the $0.2950 level, below which the price might revisit the $0.2880 support zone, followed by the $0.2850 pivot area.\n\nAn intermediate support for ripple is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2930 low to $0.3065 high. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.3060 level. If there is a clear break above the $0.3060 level, the price is likely to climb towards the $0.3100 and $0.3120 levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is showing a lot of positive signs above the $0.3000 and $0.2980 levels. As long as there is no close below the $0.2980 support area, there could be an upside continuation. If not, the price may perhaps start an extended downside correction towards the $0.2880 and $0.2850 support levels.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is slowly moving back into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is correcting lower and it could test the 55 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2990, $0.2950 and $0.2950.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.3060, $0.3100 and $0.3120.", "description": "Ripple price is showing positive signs above $0.2850 against the US Dollar, while bitcoin is trading sideways.
