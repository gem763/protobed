Riot police took to the streets of Kowloon after the petrol bomb attack.\n\nHundreds of protesters, many young and wearing face masks, were marching in Kowloon at the time and were headed to a district near the Kowloon Tong station.\n\n\"The protesters are participating in an unauthorized assembly, which constitutes an offence under the Hong Kong Laws. The police appeal to the protesters to stop all illegal acts and leave immediately,\" police said in a statement.\n\nHong Kong's protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have mushroomed in four months into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the Asian financial hub.\n\nThe protests have plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and is the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nHong Kong had experienced relative calm since last weekend, when a peaceful march by tens of thousands spiralled into a night of running battles between protesters and police.\n\nSince then there had only been small nightly protests and activists had not flagged any major action this weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n'DEFEND THE FUTURE'\n\nA small group calling itself the \"Silver-Haired Marchers\" began a 48-hour sit-in at police headquarters on Saturday, describing themselves as \"old but not obsolete\".\n\n\"The young people have already sacrificed a lot, it is about time for us, the senior citizens in Hong Kong to come forward to take up part of the responsibility from the young people,\" 63-year-old Shiu told local media.\n\n\"I mean for us, even if we are caught by the police because of an illegal gathering, I don\u2019t mind,\" said Shiu, who was identified with only one name.\n\nColonial-era emergency laws were introduced a week ago banning face masks at public rallies, sparking some of the worst violence since the protests started. Protesters use masks to shield their identities.\n\nHowever, hundreds of people, including school children and office workers, have since defied the ban and wore face masks. A group of protesters plan a \"face mask party\" on Saturday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nPOLICE CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE\n\nHong Kong's police, once praised as \"Asia's finest\", are also facing a crisis of confidence amid the worsening political tensions. Protesters accuse them of using excessive force, a charge police deny, and two protesters have been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.\n\nApple Inc removed an app this week that helped protesters track police movements, saying it was used to target officers.\n\nSeveral U.S. senators have called for halting and even banning U.S. tear gas exports to Hong Kong.\n\nOn October 1, when China marked the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, police said they deployed a record level of force, including 1,400 rounds of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets and six live rounds.\n\nSales of tear gas to Hong Kong were equivalent to supporting efforts of the Chinese president to \"harm ordinary citizens and peaceful protesters\", said U.S. Republican Senator Rick Scott in a letter to a U.S. firm exporting tear gas to Hong Kong.\n\nHe urged the firm on Thursday to \"put human rights above profits\".\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade due to the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.\n\nMany shops have been shutting early to avoid becoming a target of protesters and due to closures of the metro rail system after several stations were torched and trashed.\n\nHong Kong's metro has borne the brunt of protests and only returned to near normal operations on Friday after being completely shut down. The metro, which normally carries around 5 million people a day, will again shut early on Saturday.", "description": "Petrol bombs were thrown inside a Hong Kong metro station on Saturday but no one was injured, the government said, as pro-democracy protesters again took to the streets angry at what they believe is Beijing's tightening grip on the city.
