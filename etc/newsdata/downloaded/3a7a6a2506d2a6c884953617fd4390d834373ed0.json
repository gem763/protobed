All the built-up grime had basically disappeared, though I did a second round just to be sure. The nylon bristles were gentle enough that I couldn\u2019t find a single scratch afterward.\u201d $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the dad still using his phone in a cup as \u201cspeakers\u201d\n\nFor the dad who uses his phone in a cup as \u201cspeakers\u201d while traveling\n\nFor the dad whose \u201cluggage\u201d is also his gym bag\n\nTravelpro Luggage Crew 11 21\u201d Carry-on Expandable Spinner w/Suiter and USB Port, Black $184 (was $460, now 60% off) Speaking of carry-ons, he might just need the suitcase choice of professionals: Flight attendants and pilots consider the Travelpro spinner the suitcase to use.
