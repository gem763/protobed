(submitted by Meagan McGrath)\n\n\u201cDo you know where you are going to be getting your water from for this trip?\u201d McGrath asked Devyn.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t thought of that.\n\n\u201cWhat are your navigation skills like?\u201d McGrath went on.\n\nDevyn\u2019s plan? Google Maps.\n\n\u201cIn the desert, where you are offline for a while, if you don\u2019t have a solar panel with you, you aren't able to recharge your gadgets, you might run into a bit of trouble,\u201d McGrath added.\n\nThat\u2019s problematic.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not so easy to storm Area 51 after all.\n\nIt turns out the Facebook event organizer, who later tried to turn the event into an Alienstock music festival, has pulled out entirely.\n\nAdd to this, two Youtubers from the Netherlands were arrested while trespassing inside Area 51 on Sept. 11.\n\nGiven that Area 51 is a U.S. Air Force base, security there is intense.
