He was arrested before completing the deal and his daughter was not admitted.\n\nProsecutors recommended 15 months in prison and a $95,000 fine. His lawyers said he deserved two months and a fine.\n\nHuneeus previously said he was ashamed and saw that his actions represent 'the worst sort of entitlement.'\n\nAgustin Huneeus, center, arrives at federal court in Boston in May where he pleaded guilty to charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal. He was sentenced on Friday and will spend five months in prison\n\nHuneeus, who is the father of four daughters (pictured with their mother), secured 'extended time for his daughter to take the SAT exam'\n\nIn a statement released by the Department of Justice on Friday, it said that in 2017 Huneeus conspired with William 'Rick' Singer and others to have his daughter's college entrance exam corrected.\n\nOver the course of several months, Huneeus took steps to facilitate the scheme, including securing extended time for his daughter to take the SAT, lying to her high school guidance counselors, and arranging for her to take the exam at a test center in West Hollywood that Singer 'controlled' through the center's administrator.\n\nIn March 2018, Huneeus's daughter took the SAT with the help of co-conspirator Mark Riddell, and received a higher score.\n\nActress Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison after admitting her part in the scheme\n\nHuffman (right) was spotted with one of her daughters dropping off cupcakes at a rehab center in Los Angeles two days after her sentencing\n\nWilliam 'Rick' Singer, who is accused of masterminding the scandal, has pleaded guilty to four felonies\n\nThe following month, Huneeus then paid $50,000 to Singer's shame charity, the Key Worldwide Foundation, to pay for the scheme.\n\nHowever, the statement claimed that Huneeus was not happy with the results of the fraudulent exam scheme, and considered pursuing it on two more occasions.\n\n'Ultimately, Huneeus decided to use the college recruitment scheme to guarantee his daughter's admission to USC. During a call intercepted by a court-authorized wiretap, Singer explained the recruitment scheme in detail and the cost to Huneeus,' according to the statement.\n\nThe DOJ said that in September 2018, Singer sent Donna Heinel, the senior athletic director at USC, an email with Huneeus's daughter's high school transcript, fraudulent SAT score, a fabricated athletic profile, and a photograph that was intended to appear to be Huneeus's daughter playing water polo.\n\nIn November 2018, Heinel emailed Singer a conditional acceptance letter for Huneeus's daughter stating that she was admitted to USC as a water polo player.\n\nLater that month, Huneeus sent a $50,000 check to Heinel purportedly for the 'USC Women's Athletics Board'.\n\nHe was arrested before making the final, agreed payment of $200,000 to Singer.\n\nCo-defendants, actress Felicity Huffman, Devin Sloane, Stephen Semprevivo, and Gordon Caplan were previously sentenced to two weeks, four months, four months, and one month in prison, respectively.\n\nHuffman, the most high profile of the co-defendants, was sentenced to 14 days in federal prison last month, followed by a year of probation.\n\nShe admitted to paying a five-figure bribe in exchange for a proctor falsifying her daughter's standardized aptitude test to get the teen a higher score.\n\nAt her sentencing on September 13, the actress, 56, addressed the court just moments before she learned her fate, breaking down in tears as she said: 'I have inflicted more damage than I could\u2019ve ever imagined.'\n\nShe then admitted her guilt once more and told the judge her actions were 'frightened, stupid and so wrong,' and added that she deserved whatever sentence was handed down.\n\nAt least 11 defendants have pleaded guilty in the scandal, however dozens more maintain their innocence.\n\nActress Lori Loughlin has denied she paid the alleged $500,000 to get her daughters, Olivia and Bella, into USC\n\nLoughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli (pictured) waived their right to appear in court when they were arraigned earlier this year\n\nAmong them is actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli are pleading not guilty in the college admissions bribery scam.\n\nLoughlin, 54, and Giannulli, 55, said in court documents filed Monday they are waiving their right to appear in court for an arraignment and plead not guilty.\n\nThe Full House star and husband Giannulli each face up to 40 years in prison for allegedly paying $500,000 to get their daughters, Olivia and Isabella, into USC, as crew recruits, even though neither is a rower.\n\nThey haven't publicly addressed the allegations against them.\n\nDailyMail.com revealed that Loughlin and Giannulli turned down a plea deal which would have drastically reduced their sentences because they thought prosecutors were 'bluffing' when they said they could end up behind bars.\n\nThe couple were initially charged with mail and mail fraud but federal prosecutors added money laundering to the list of accusations against them.", "description": "Agustin Huneeus, 53, of San Francisco, was sentenced in Boston's federal court on Friday after pleading guilty to a single count of fraud and conspiracy.", "authors": ["Associated Press And Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/23/19316800-0-image-a-6_1570226402203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
