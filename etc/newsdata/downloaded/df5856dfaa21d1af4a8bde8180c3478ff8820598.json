It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new parliament that can make decisions,\u201d he wrote to Corbyn.\n\n\u201cProlonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behavior of parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.\u201d\n\nCorbyn, a veteran critic of the EU, said he wanted to wait until Friday to see what Brussels had decided to do with Britain\u2019s request for a delay - something Johnson was forced to ask for by parliament.\n\n\u201cThe principle is take \u2018no deal\u2019 off the table, the EU answers tomorrow, then we can decide,\u201d Corbyn told reporters.\n\nThe Scottish National Party and other smaller parties rejected the prime minister\u2019s attempt to force an election, casting doubt on whether the Conservative leader will be able to secure the votes needed to hold a ballot before Christmas.\n\nDEAD DEADLINE\n\nMore than three years after Britons voted 52%-48% to be the first sovereign country to leave the European project, the future of Brexit is unclear.\n\nBrexit has increasingly dominated politics, pushing other pressing issues aside. On Thursday, Brexit delays were blamed for finance minister Sajid Javid postponing his first budget.\n\nJohnson won the top job in July by staking his career on getting Brexit done by Oct. 31, though in Thursday\u2019s letter he makes clear he is ready to scrap his deadline. Last month, he said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask for a delay.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen outside Downing Street in London, Britain October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nBut several of his aides think he can weather any criticism for failing to meet the deadline by arguing that he was thwarted by lawmakers, doubling down on his team\u2019s narrative of \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d.\n\nAt a meeting of Johnson\u2019s top ministers, some media reported disagreement over whether the government should try for an early election, fearing that doing so before Brexit was settled might damage the Conservatives.\n\nJohnson seems to still hold out hope of securing a deal with Brussels, offering parliament until Nov. 6 to ratify an agreement he settled with the EU last week.\n\n\u201cThis means that we could get Brexit done before the election on 12 December, if MPs (members of parliament) choose to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour has long said it cannot back an election until no- deal Brexit is off the table. But if the EU grants an extension until the end of January, that would appear to remove the threat of Johnson taking Britain out of the bloc without an agreement.\n\nBy proposing to dissolve parliament on Nov. 6, that would also be beyond the current Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nLEAVE WITH JOHNSON\u2019S DEAL\n\nEarlier, a senior Downing Street source said Britain would ultimately leave the EU with Johnson\u2019s deal despite the likely additional delay, with the EU considering offering London a three-month flexible Brexit extension.\n\n\u201cThis ends with us leaving with the PM\u2019s deal,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe will leave with a deal, with the PM\u2019s deal.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nAll eyes are now on not whether, but by how long, the EU decides to extend the Brexit process: Germany supports a three-month delay, while France is pushing for a shorter one.\n\nBoth fear a no-deal exit that would almost certainly hurt global growth and create a potentially deeper EU crisis.\n\nTo offer Britain a long extension would take the pressure off British lawmakers to approve Johnson\u2019s deal and open up possibilities such as a referendum on it. A short extension might focus minds in the British parliament.\n\nBrexit was initially supposed to have taken place on March 29 but Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May was forced to delay twice - first to April 12 and then to Oct. 31 - as parliament defeated her Brexit deal by margins of between 58 and 230 votes earlier this year.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Thursday for a general election on Dec. 12 to break Britain's Brexit impasse, conceding for the first time he will not meet his \"do or die\" deadline to leave the European Union next week.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Elizabeth Piper", "Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444557218&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1K3", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
