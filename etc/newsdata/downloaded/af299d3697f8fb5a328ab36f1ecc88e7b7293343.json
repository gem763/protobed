The Outer Worlds tells a slightly different story, about how humanity\u2019s settlement of the stars would go if it were driven by a 1950s style corporate culture. It\u2019s a distinct vision of adventure capitalism on new and dangerous planets, with a similarly comedy-bleak outlook.\n\nDeveloped by Obsidian, makers of Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic II and Fallout: New Vegas, the first piece of good news is that The Outer Worlds harks back to Fallout\u2019s golden age, when conversations were at the heart of the game rather than a minor inconvenience to be minimised where possible. Talking is central to everything in The Outer Worlds, a game that\u2019s been structured so that you can complete all its campaign missions without even firing a shot, if your character is charming and persuasive enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou play a deep-frozen colonist, whose 10-year journey from Earth ends with the entire ship drifting in space because the Halcyon system\u2019s economy is in such bad shape it isn\u2019t profitable enough to thaw everyone out. You\u2019re plucked at random from the freezer by wanted fugitive Phineas Welles, who would like your help to fight back against the cold-blooded corporations that are in charge.\n\nYou quickly inherit a starship, and once you\u2019ve fixed it up and recruited your first crew member it\u2019s time to explore the solar system, righting wrongs and inadvertently creating a great many of your own. Partly inspired by Firefly\u2019s brand of Frontierland-in-space, this has a similarly Wild West aesthetic, the one-horse towns and colourful characters embodying the pioneer spirit, whilst bucking against their corporate overlords and the appalling bureaucracy they inflict.\n\nThe Outer Worlds\u2019 biggest departure from the established Fallout model is that rather than exploring solo you can select up to two companions from your slowly expanding crew to accompany you on missions. As well as adding firepower they also bring their own skills, and boost yours, adding to your ability to hack computers, fix machines, lie, charm, and intimidate. But they turn out to be a lot more interesting than just walking stat buffs.\n\nEach companion comes with his or her own backstory, character arc, and personality. As well as backing you up in a fight they also chip in on conversations and chat amongst themselves as you\u2019re exploring. The sheer quantity and quality of dialogue for each is astounding, given the huge number of missions and conversations you undertake and the range of crew members you have available to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s supremely well written, with eccentric characters proving to be funny, articulate, and well-acted. If you\u2019ve recently been playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint, this won\u2019t so much be refreshing as a reaffirmation that conversations in video games can be compelling rather than soul-crushing. And they don\u2019t have to be locked away in soporific cut scenes either. The Outer Worlds\u2019 character interactions are central to most missions.\n\nYou\u2019ll regularly have five choices of what to say, some of which come from your intelligence, perception, or, say, medical skills, and others that are available to all. Some responses will be kind, some rude, and some magnificently absurd. The result is that each encounter is captivating, as well as furthering both plot and mission objectives. It\u2019s inspiring, and the writers\u2019 ability to keep throwing fresh and often hilarious new personalities at you remains a delight throughout.\n\nThe Outer Worlds (PS4) \u2013 not only good dialogue, but funny dialogue\n\nSomething that hasn\u2019t changed one bit since the days of Fallout is the plethora of loot. Carrying capacity will never be too far from the front of your mind as you plunder everything that\u2019s not nailed down to use, sell, or breakdown for parts. Whether it\u2019s the corpse of a freshly downed marauder or a previously locked room in a company office, there\u2019s loot all over the place and it\u2019s always in your interests to acquire as much of it as you can lift.\n\nAs you win fights and complete objectives you earn experience points to level up your character. Each level gives you 10 upgrade points to spend on stats that max out at 100 but allow you to specialise more deeply once they pass 50. Every two levels you also get a new perk point, which can be applied to gain a permanent bonus. Your companions have perks too, which you choose to complement your own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot content with the usual character development path, Obsidian has also incorporated the flaws system. Keep getting burnt, and you\u2019ll be offered a free perk point in return for a small flame-related debuff. Fall off a lot of high places, and you\u2019ll be offered a fear of heights, again in return for a perk. It\u2019s an interesting system that does indeed result in a more defined character, with weaknesses as well as strengths, that specifically relate to what\u2019s happened on your adventure so far.\n\nYou\u2019ll need all the buffs you can get, because fights do get messy. First person melee combat is always a bit chaotic, but once you add the weapons output of two companions and however many enemies you\u2019re blasting there can be a great deal of hot lead and plasma flying around thanks to guns that have a chunky, primitive charm. It\u2019s all manageable though, and triggering your companions\u2019 recharging special moves at the right time is a skill of its own.\n\nAlong with human foes, each planet comes with its own ferocious wildlife, from giant larva-like mantipillars to lizardy raptidons, and automechanicals \u2013 The Outer Worlds\u2019 take on robots. They all have weaknesses to certain types of attack, whether electric, fire-based, or ballistic, while the numbers that pop up showing how much damage you\u2019re dealing drop towards the bottom of the screen if the weapon you\u2019re using is ill-suited to that enemy. It\u2019s a neat visual cue that doesn\u2019t get in the way of the action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the other things The Outer Worlds gets almost perfectly right is the balance amongst the game\u2019s different skills and their usefulness in any given situation. You genuinely can talk your way through most missions. At the same time, engineering, weapons, and melee skills will also see you right, even if having those alone will mean you can\u2019t open certain locked chests and rooms. There are even unique weapons that rely on the science skill to increase damage, bolstering the arsenals of those who choose a more cerebral approach and allowing you to take on the occasional side quest that really does just need firepower.\n\nAlthough every bit as deep and complex as Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout, it has a far greater level of polish, with no bugs or crashes evident during a lengthy playthrough. The graphics may be a bit lo-fi, but they still manage to conjure a sense of planetary-scale grandeur. Given the astonishing intricacy of the systems involved and the diversity of different characters and their potential interactions with the plot, it\u2019s a remarkable achievement. Your actions also feel unusually consequential, the things you say and those you decide to spare or attack and kill, all making a lasting difference.\n\nIt adds up to an experience that\u2019s memorable and continually surprising. Each planet has its own look and feel \u2013 one with rings, one overlooked by a gas giant, another by an explorable moon. And there\u2019s artistry at work, not only in the colourful yet deadly fauna, and beauty of its worlds and rusting space stations, but also in the way the plot is woven in with your character and those you recruit to your crew. Every aspect has been thought through and refined, creating what is one of the most enthralling role-playing games of recent years.\n\nThe Outer Worlds review summary In Short: A deep, funny, and intricately designed RPG reminiscent of the golden age of Fallout, when conversations mattered and comedy-grade cynicism came fitted as standard. Pros: Interesting, polished, and good-looking. The companion system adds both firepower and personality to a game that\u2019s already bursting with character. Cons: The similarities to Fallout are legion, and there will be some who don\u2019t like all that chat and wish the gunplay was a shade more central.
