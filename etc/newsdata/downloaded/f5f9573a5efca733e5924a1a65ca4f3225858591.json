Cassini launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1997, then spent seven years in transit followed by 13 years orbiting Saturn. An artist's impression of the Cassini spacecraft studying Saturn In 2000 it spent six months studying Jupiter before reaching Saturn in 2004. In that time, it discovered six more moons around Saturn, three-dimensional structures towering above Saturn's rings, and a giant storm that raged across the planet for nearly a year. On 13 December 2004 it made its first flyby of Saturn's moons Titan and Dione. On 24 December it released the European Space Agency-built Huygens probe on Saturn's moon Titan to study its atmosphere and surface composition. There it discovered eerie hydrocarbon lakes made from ethane and methane. In 2008, Cassini completed its primary mission to explore the Saturn system and began its mission extension (the Cassini Equinox Mission). In 2010 it began its second mission (Cassini Solstice Mission) which lasted until it exploded in Saturn's atmosphere. In December 2011, Cassini obtained the highest resolution images of Saturn's moon Enceladus. In December of the following year it tracked the transit of Venus to test the feasibility of observing planets outside our solar system. In March 2013 Cassini made the last flyby of Saturn's moon Rhea and measured its internal structure and gravitational pull. Cassini didn't just study Saturn - it also captured incredible views of its many moons. In the image above, Saturn's moon Enceladus can be seen drifting before the rings and the tiny moon Pandora. It was captured on Nov. 1, 2009, with the entire scene is backlit by the Sun In July of that year Cassini captured a black-lit Saturn to examine the rings in fine detail and also captured an image of Earth. In April of this year it completed its closest flyby of Titan and started its Grande Finale orbit which finished on September 15. 'The mission has changed the way we think of where life may have developed beyond our Earth,' said Andrew Coates, head of the Planetary Science Group at Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. 'As well as Mars, outer planet moons like Enceladus, Europa and even Titan are now top contenders for life elsewhere,' he added. 'We've completely rewritten the textbooks about Saturn.'\n\nThe team is hopeful about this new theory, as it could explain why other planets and moons without atmosphere have similar dunes.\n\nThis includes Makemake and Pluto, both of which have shown indications of organic ice on their surface.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that both theories that seek to explain the means by which the dunes on Titan form are still unproven.\n\nBut they hope that will change, as NASA plans to send a probe called Dragonfly to Titan, which is set to land near the dunes in 2026.\n\nNASA made an announcement in June during a media teleconference, detailing its vision of a robotic rotorcraft dubbed Dragonfly that will collect samples and measure soil composition in search for signs of habitability.\n\nThe enormous, icy moon is said to be the most Earth-like world in the solar system, and previous findings by the Cassini mission suggest it holds some of the ingredients necessary for the emergence of life.\n\nDragonfly is a bold, game-changing way to explore the solar system,\u2019 said APL Director Ralph Semmel.\n\n\u2018This mission is a visionary combination of creativity and technical risk-taking that will help us unravel some of the most critical mysteries of the universe \u2014 including, possibly, the keys to our origins.'\n\nNASA plans to send a probe called Dragonfly to Titan, which is set to land near the dunes in 2026 (artist impressions)\n\nInitially, Dragonfly will carry out a 2.7-year mission to explore different sites across Titan, including dunes and impact craters.\n\nObservations from the Cassini mission indicate these areas once held liquid water and complex organic materials.\n\nThe dual quadcopter will sample these organic surface materials and measure their composition in effort to characterize the large moon\u2019s habitability.\n\nDragonfly will first touchdown in an equatorial area known as the \u2018Shangri-La\u2019 dune fields, which have been compared to the Namibian dunes in southern Africa.\n\nIt will then complete \u2018leapfrog\u2019 flights of around 5 miles (8km) each to hop to other areas, stopping to take samples from each site.\n\nEventually, Dragonfly will make its way to the Selk impact crater, where scientists have spotted evidence of last liquid water, organic (carbon-containing) molecules, and energy.\n\nThese, together, are said to be the building blocks for life.", "description": "Experts have debunked the theory that claims the sand dunes on Saturn's largest moon were formed from rainfall.
