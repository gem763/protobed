Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who wrote online Thursday morning that he had spoken with Trump regarding Venezuela.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true he disagreed with some of the views of previous advisor,\u201d Rubio, a fierce critic of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, had reported of his conversation with Trump.\n\n\u201cBut as he reminded me it\u2019s actually the DIRECT OPPOSITE of what many claim or assume,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cIf in fact the direction of policy changes it won\u2019t be to make it weaker.\u201d\n\nAmong his other international priorities atop the National Security Council, Bolton had championed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3's attempted overthrow of Maduro \u2014 a regime change that remains unfulfilled eight months after the administration formally recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the South American nation\u2019s legitimate \u201cinterim president.\u201d\n\nTrump, who announced Bolton\u2019s resignation on Tuesday, asserted to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he regularly backed a more hard-line brand of foreign policy than his ex-aide.\n\n\u201cFrankly, he wanted to do things not necessarily tougher than me,\u201d Trump said, later adding that Bolton \u201cwasn't in line with what we were doing, and actually, in some cases, he thought it was too tough what we were doing.\u201d\n\nBut Trump also denounced Bolton\u2019s advocacy for the 2003 invasion of Iraq from within President George W. Bush's administration, mocking him as \u201cMr. Tough Guy\u201d and remarking: \u201cHe's so tough, he got us into Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s statements this week are at odds with his previous assessments of Bolton\u2019s counsel. At a news conference in May, Trump shrugged off reports that he was losing confidence in his national security adviser and said he also receives input from \u201cother people that are a little more dovish\u201d than Bolton.\n\n\"He has strong views on things, but that's OK,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI actually temper John, which is pretty amazing.\u201d", "description": "The president had previously said he tempered his hawkish former aide.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/97/2d/fa1bab75428180e343028d3d5de9/190912-trump-bolton-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
