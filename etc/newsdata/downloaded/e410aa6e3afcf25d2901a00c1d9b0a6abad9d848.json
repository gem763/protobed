And that strange overlapping of two worlds was never as visible as in L.A.\u2019s vibrant party scene and its rich drinking culture.\n\nThe movie\u2019s main character, Dalton, has never been quite the movie star he dreamt to be. He\u2019s a moderately successful actor who specializes in westerns and, after starring on his own TV series, is on the verge of becoming irrelevant. In search of a new break, his agent (Al Pacino, in a delightful cameo) offers to send him off to Italy, to shoot spaghetti westerns. The strategy horrifies Dalton (even though at the time it had worked for the admittedly younger Clint Eastwood). Dalton also has a drinking problem, taking frequent sips from the hip flask he carries everywhere. The man enjoys cocktails, too. On set one day, he keeps flubbing his lines and blames it on the eight Whiskey Sours he had drunk that day. He is also seen, near the end of the film, gulping frozen Margaritas from a blender. As for Booth, his dog\u2019s name Brandy might be a clue as to his drinking preferences.\n\nDalton\u2019s glamorous neighbors on Cielo Drive\u2013and the objects of all his professional desires\u2013are it-couple Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski (played by Margot Robbie and Rafal Zawierucha). Tate\u2019s zest for life is shown here as alcohol-free. She exemplifies the young generation of Hollywood stars for whom weed takes the place of cocktails.\n\nThis contrast\u2013boozy older actors vs. weed-smoking younger movie stars\u2013actually played out across Hollywood. Take for instance one of the star couples of the L.A. party scene: 53-year-old Frank Sinatra and 24-year-old Mia Farrow. The star of the Polanski-directed Rosemary\u2019s Baby, Farrow was generally referred to in the press as a \u201cflower child,\u201d a fawn-like beauty with impeccable Hollywood pedigree (her father was the director John Farrow, her mother the actress Maureen O\u2019Sullivan), whose likes and dislikes were typical for her post-war generation. She had married Sinatra in 1966, after an improbable romance, and soon found herself hanging out with his old pals\u2014ex-wife Ava Gardner, the usual Rat Pack suspects\u2014and their boozy ways.\n\nSinatra was never far from a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s, his way of nursing every hurt and celebrating every feat. As Farrow, whose sister Prudence inspired a famous Beatles song, acknowledges herself in her memoir What Falls Away, she favored marijuana (and the occasional LSD trip) over drinks. According to Sinatra\u2019s biographer James Kaplan, when Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes gave her a solid-gold cigarette case as a birthday gift, she used it for her joints.\n\nBest epitomized by the Sinatra-Farrow marriage, Hollywood was at the time deeply divided between the old-schoolers\u2013who ate chili at Chasen\u2019s, sipped Old-Fashioneds and Martinis\u2013and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll-obsessed, weed-smoking younger actors and filmmakers. But what made the era fascinating was the frequent mixing of the two crowds. Take the Whisky a Go Go for instance, one of the biggest venues of the party scene at the time. For years, Hollywood royalty had partied on the Sunset Strip, under the glass ceiling of the Mocambo with its colorful birds flying around or among the giant trees of the Cocoanut Grove. But in the mid-\u201960s, most of these places closed, forcing their aging clientele to shake things up and give way to a new trend: discotheques.\n\nNew spots like Whiskey a Go Go, the Daisy and the Factory offered Angelenos a different, more exciting experience modeled on the European clubs. The idea was to dance like mad and invite everyone to do so by doing away with all the tables and chairs. Which meant the drinking took a back seat to the dancing.\n\nThe Whisky had so-called \u201cgo go dancers,\u201d girls in fringed costumes dancing in cages suspended above the dance floor, a sight for the crowds and musicians alike. At the Whisky, in 1966, you could listen to the Doors live (they were the house band for a year until Jim Morrison improvised the \u201cFuck the mother\u201d line in \u201cThe End\u201d and got the band fired). But even more interesting was its dance floor where you could see 36-year-old Steve McQueen chatting with 62-year-old Cary Grant or encounter Grant\u2019s contemporary James Mason, fresh out of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Lolita. When the Beatles came to town, the Whisky was the one place they requested to visit, partying until the wee hours with Jayne Mansfield. Stars with Golden Age connections like Warren Beatty (who dated Natalie Wood) or Jane Fonda (the daughter of Henry Fonda) brought in an intriguing mix of old and young stars.\n\nAnother regular at the discotheque was Charles \u201cTex\u201d Watson, who, along with Patricia Krenwinkel, Susan Atkins and lookout Linda Kasabian, murdered five people, including Sharon Tate at Cielo Drive. Pretty soon, according to Whisky\u2019s owner Elmer Valentine\u2019s memories as told to Vanity Fair, more acid was being sold on the parking lot behind the joint than drinks inside. In the movie, Booth even smokes an acid-tinged cigarette.\n\nAt the end of Once Upon a Time in\u2026Hollywood, Dalton and Booth go to their favorite drinking place, Casa Vega on Ventura Boulevard. In real life, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the restaurant\u2019s owner has found the perfect way to thank the film\u2019s cast and crew for the recent publicity by adding a new drink to the cocktail menu. It\u2019s a riff on the Margarita, which is so beloved by the film\u2019s director. Its name? Naturally, the Tarantino.", "description": "A look at Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in\u2026Hollywood\u201d and what it says about L.A.\u2019s late 1960s party scene and drinking culture.", "authors": ["Florence Colombani"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567373403/190830-Rothbaum-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tease_quxvyx"}
