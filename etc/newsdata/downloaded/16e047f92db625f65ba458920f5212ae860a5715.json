Washington will rely on Derrius Guice to be its primary running back, while Chris Thompson and Wendell Smallwood active as backups.\n\nTeams can only have 46 active players on game day, meaning seven players will have to be inactive.\n\nWashington made the move because it not only has confidence in Guice, but because of special teams, an area which Peterson does not contribute. The Redskins opted to keep Smallwood, who was claimed off waivers on Monday, active because of his ability to contribute on special teams.\n\nRegardless, it will be interesting to observe the fallout from this decision. NFL Network reported some of the Redskins\u2019 veterans were unhappy with the move. Last season, Peterson was often Washington\u2019s driving force on offense, rushing for 1,042 yards. The 34-year-old, too, was a late addition to the Redskins\u2019 roster, joining the team in August 2018, days after Guice tore his ACL.\n\nThe Redskins re-signed Peterson in the offseason to a two-year, $5 million deal. Only $1.5 million of that money was guaranteed.\n\nOn Thursday, Peterson seemed to accept his reduced role, telling reporters: \u201cI\u2019m pleased to do what they ask me to do. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d\n\nPeterson joined tight end Jordan Reed (concussion), quarterback Colt McCoy (leg), cornerback Fabian Moreau (ankle), center Ross Piersbacher, guard Wes Martin and defensive lineman Treyvon Hester as the Redskins\u2019 other inactives.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
