(Remo Casilli/Reuters)\n\nDaniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything\n\nBeing the secretary of state is never an easy job. Being the secretary of state when the president of the United States is Donald Trump is a next-to-impossible task. It says something that Mike Pompeo has managed to be at the job for more than 18 months with almost no back chatter about President Trump tiring of him.\n\nWhat it says, of course, is subject to debate.\n\nDuring his time in office, Pompeo largely stuck to the Faustian bargain he made when he entered this administration. He demonstrated unswerving public loyalty toward Trump and the few foreign policy issues he cared about. In return, Pompeo has been the most prominent voice in Trump\u2019s foreign policy. This worked for him in no small part because he had the good fortune to replace the worst secretary of state in history at Foggy Bottom. Just by being more closely tied to the president, Pompeo made the State Department more relevant.\n\nThe Ukraine scandal and its ensuing fallout, however, have highlighted the contradictions that the secretary of state had managed to suppress. He is starting to stink as much as the Parmesan cheese that an Italian reporter gave Pompeo on Tuesday.\n\nFor one thing, after stonewalling questions about his involvement in Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, Pompeo confirmed on Wednesday that he had been listening to the conversation. He also resisted requests from the House of Representatives for State Department employees to testify about their knowledge of the Trump White House\u2019s efforts to lean on Ukraine for partisan political purposes. He did this both through an officious letter to three House chairs as well as at a news conference overseas:\n\n\"I was on the phone call.\"\n\n\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admits that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. https://t.co/V5ORf33o8j pic.twitter.com/tmEBC1721Z \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 2, 2019\n\nIn making these moves, Pompeo has undercut his support among two vital constituencies: Congress and his own diplomatic corps.\n\nIt increasingly appears that Pompeo has lost the building. Ironically, Pompeo\u2019s righteous indignation in defense of his Foreign Service officers appears to be a tipping point. It highlights Pompeo\u2019s massive hypocrisy as the secretary. He clearly wants to protect diplomats from congressional testimony that could negatively affect Trump. He had less concern about FSOs when he acceded to the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from Ukraine after Rudolph W. Giuliani pushed a right-wing conspiracy theory (with the help of an imprisoned Paul Manafort) to force her out. Pompeo has done absolutely nothing to force out Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley despite an Inspector General report about Moley\u2019s abusive behavior toward FSOs. The timing of further investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails also dents Pompeo\u2019s claim of acting in good faith.\n\nThe diplomatic corps is starting to rebel. A petition in support of Yovanovitch was started among retired diplomats. Politico\u2019s Nahal Toosi also reports a fair amount of resentment brewing at Foggy Bottom:\n\nA current State Department staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect his job, described the Pompeo letter as \u201cthe height of irony.\u201d \u2026 Pompeo\u2019s letter also drew derisive comments from people who remember his time as a congressman, when he loudly pressured the Clinton-led State Department to release information about the 2012 attack that killed four Americans, including an ambassador, in Benghazi, Libya.... Since the memo detailing Trump\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart was released, dozens of foreign service officers have joined a private Facebook group for those considering quitting their jobs, a member of the group told POLITICO.\n\nLow-level grumbling is one thing, but Pompeo also appears to be unable to stop some of the subpoenaed individuals from testifying. The Daily Beast\u2019s Erin Banco reports that Pompeo forced Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker to resign in an effort to cauterize the Ukraine wound that Giuliani keeps opening on cable news. The problem, as Banco notes, is that, \u201cPompeo\u2019s plan appears to have backfired. Despite the secretary\u2019s efforts to block several of his current and former officials from speaking to Congress, Volker is set to go to Capitol Hill on Thursday with the backing of a cadre of current and former diplomats.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cseveral U.S. officials told The Daily Beast the former Ukraine negotiator said openly that he was not ready to leave his position.\u201d Volker has allies in the media; Pompeo, not so much.\n\nIn addition to Volker, Yovanovitch will testify next week. The House also learned more about the precise conspiracy theories Giuliani was pushing on the State Department to get Yovanovitch recalled. Neither this tolerance of conspiracy theories nor Pompeo\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine affair will endear him to congressional Democrats.\n\nMike Pompeo is still the secretary of state, and Trump supports him. That counts for a lot. But other constituencies matter for the secretary of state to do his job, and Pompeo is alienating several of those. None of this will force him out of office, but it will make him a weaker and less effective secretary of state. And he was never James Baker in the first place.", "description": "Just look at what this man will do to defend the Foreign Service!", "authors": ["Daniel W. Drezner", "Daniel W.
