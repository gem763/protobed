With her manager\u2019s permission, she left work early to go to the hospital. Her mother-in-law\u2019s condition worsened the next day, and Sandra, who asked that only her first name be used, notified Amazon that she had to remain at the hospital. Her mother-in-law died the next day, and Sandra called the warehouse again to request bereavement leave, of which Amazon offers three days.\n\nBut Amazon grants workers limited time off, even without pay, and the time spent in the hospital had overdrawn Sandra\u2019s balance by one hour before the bereavement leave set in. After she returned to work, her manager informed her that she was fired.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in The Twilight Zone,\u201d Sandra says. \u201cI\u2019m dealing with a death in my family, and I\u2019m going to lose my job over one hour?\u201d\n\nThe firing galvanized other workers at the facility who formed a group called Amazonians United Sacramento. Early on the morning of September 30th, they submitted a petition to the site manager and Amazon human resources demanding that Sandra be rehired and workers be given paid time off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dealing with a death in my family, and I\u2019m going to lose my job over one hour?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Amazon is a trillion dollar company run by the richest man in the world, permanent part-time employees working 8 hour shifts are only allowed 10 days off a year for any reason,\u201d the demand letter reads. \u201cThis means that every day we use [unpaid time off] for family emergencies, sickness, or vacation, we are one step closer to termination.\u201d\n\nThough Amazon often touts the medical insurance and paid time off it gives its warehouse workers, those benefits only apply to full-time employees. Amazon also employs large numbers of permanent part-time workers, particularly in the company\u2019s smaller, last-mile warehouses, such as the one in Sacramento, where goods are sorted before being sent out for delivery. Employees at the Sacramento delivery center say that all of the approximately 500 workers there are restricted to part-time work, and their hours are limited to fewer than the 30 per week that would obligate Amazon to offer them health care under the Affordable Care Act. They receive neither medical insurance nor paid time off.\n\n\u201cThey very explicitly put a cap on how many hours you can work a week to keep everybody under having to give them those benefits,\u201d says an employee at the Sacramento warehouse who asked to remain anonymous. Amazon\u2019s job listings indicate that workers at these facilities work between 15 and 25 hours a week, and an employee at a Chicago delivery center says workers receive an alert in the scheduling portal if they attempt to take extra shifts that surpass the 30-hour limit.\n\nThey receive neither medical insurance nor paid time off\n\nThe lack of paid time off is particularly difficult for part-time workers because, without it, they are left to rely on the small allotment of unpaid hours off that Amazon allows them to take before getting fired. Employees are given 20 hours of unpaid time off per quarter, which equates to about two and a half shifts for most workers. Workers call taking too much unpaid time \u201cgoing negative\u201d and say it results in automatic firing. \u201cThey just have a computer program that automatically fires people, no human oversight over what the conditions or concerns might have been,\u201d says a Chicago delivery center worker who asked to remain anonymous. Employees say the system makes it difficult to work second jobs, deal with family emergencies, or even recover from the physical strain of work at Amazon.\n\nAmazon says the firings are not automatic and that the company takes into account individual circumstances should employees require additional time off. Amazon also responded that though part-time workers aren\u2019t offered medical insurance, they are offered vision and dental coverage, as well as funding for medical expenses. (A Sacramento employee says it comes out to about $10 a week.) The company also says that, in addition to being allowed 20 hours of unpaid time off per quarter, part-time workers get three days of paid bereavement leave and accrued sick leave in accordance with local laws.\n\n\u201cEverybody in our warehouse is very time stretched.\u201d\n\n\u201cRunning out of [unpaid time off] is probably the most common reason people get fired,\u201d says the Sacramento employee. \u201cEverybody in our warehouse is very time stretched, most people have other jobs or responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSandra, for instance, came to Amazon earlier this year after finding that her clerical job with the county was no longer enough to support her and her four children. The combined hours were grueling: 8:30AM to 5PM Monday through Friday at the county, then Saturday, Sunday, and Monday working from 8:15PM to 4:45AM at Amazon. At first, she found the work hard on her body, and finishing work before dawn on Sunday, then going to work at the county Monday, then returning to Amazon that night was particularly punishing. Nevertheless, she was able to maintain the pace until her mother-in-law took ill.\n\nWhile the workers were collecting signatures for the petition, they learned of another recent time-off firing. The employee, who asked to remain anonymous, says she was fired after taking three shifts off to make sure her children were safe during a domestic dispute. \u201cYour engagement is critical in order for Amazon to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company!\u201d reads the email informing her she has a negative unpaid time off balance and has been fired.\n\n\u201cAll I needed was time, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I needed was those days to clear it, and then the rest of the week I\u2019m good and ready to work for them,\u201d she says. \u201cAll I needed was time, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAsked about the petition, Amazon responded with a statement: \u201cAmazon maintains an open-door policy that encourages employees to bring their comments, questions, and concerns directly to their management team for discussion and resolution. We have a long standing policy of not commenting on personnel matters.\u201d\n\nThe unpaid time-off quota is a source of stress even for full-time Amazon workers who get paid time off with prior approval. When I reported on the Prime Day strike earlier this year at a fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota, multiple workers were afraid to walk out because Amazon had said it would count time spent protesting toward their quota of time off. Some were already almost to their limit, and others worried they might need it to handle an emergency later. Given that workers can be fired for overdrawing their unpaid time off, a labor law expert told me at the time that the practice could constitute retaliation for protected activity.\n\n\u201cI never really heard of unpaid time off until I started coming across Amazon.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the logistics industry, the ability to take time off without pay is not typically treated as a benefit. \u201cI never really heard of unpaid time off until I started coming across Amazon,\u201d says Sheheryar Kaoosji, executive director of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a California-based nonprofit. Typically, he says, it\u2019s something that would be worked out informally with a manager if, for instance, someone had to leave work early to take care of a sick child. Amazon, as it tends to do, has quantified and systematized the process.\n\nThe result is a lack of flexibility for workers who require it most. Being part-time workers, they often need to take second jobs. It also stands in marked contrast with the flexibility Amazon enjoys when it comes to scheduling workers. Amazon carefully modulates its workforce according to the amount of goods that need to be processed, and it often sends employees home early when work is slow. \u201cWhat the company wants is flexibility on their end, but there\u2019s less flexibility on the workers end,\u201d says Kaoosji.\n\nAdding further inflexibility, the time-off system deducts a full hour if workers arrive more than five minutes late. Consequently, two workers say, managers encourage workers to use their California-mandated paid sick leave, which can be deducted in shorter increments, to cover lateness, reserving their unpaid time off in case they become actually sick later.\n\nManagers encourage workers to use their California-mandated sick leave to cover lateness\n\nAmazon\u2019s use of part-time work is poised to grow as it pursues next-day delivery. While the enormous fulfillment centers where goods are stored are staffed by full-time workers, the smaller warehouses where goods are sorted into routes for delivery, like the Sacramento center, are overwhelmingly staffed by part-time workers. \u201cAs they build out last mile infrastructure, it\u2019s predominantly part-time work,\u201d says Spencer Cox, an economic geography PhD candidate who worked in an Amazon fulfillment center. He estimates that about one-third of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment workers are part-time.\n\nAmazon is also bringing its policies governing part-time workers in other parts of the company into line with those of warehouse employees. Earlier this month, Business Insider reported that Amazon is cutting health benefits to part-time Whole Foods workers.\n\nWorkers at the Sacramento warehouse had already been organizing around other issues before Sandra was fired. In December, workers signed a letter demanding the reversal of changes to the layout of the facility that they said was causing injuries. Later, a group submitted letters to an employee bulletin board requesting a more lenient break schedule and other changes. The push for paid time off is the largest action so far. The petition garnered 78 signatures in nine days.\n\nThe Sacramento petition is the latest in a string of labor actions at Amazon. Workers in Amazon\u2019s fulfillment center outside of Minneapolis have been particularly active, protesting the increasing pace of work and lack of sufficient breaks. The workers in Sacramento were watching their strike on Prime Day. \u201cIt was kind of a motivator,\u201d the employee says. \u201cIf they can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are quite a few things I think a lot of us wish would change or would improve.\u201d\n\nJust after midnight on September 30th, as the workers started their lunch break, they gathered in the break room and approached the manager with the petition, explaining their demands. An employee who attended said the manager seemed confused but agreed to pass the petition on. \u201cThey know that we will get fired if we go in the negative or have zero UPT left. But I think the fact that fellow associates really cared about the fact that this woman got fired for one single hour of UPT in the negative when she had a funeral to attend, I feel like he was surprised that everybody that signed it bothered to sign it,\u201d the employee says.\n\nThe group recently conducted a survey of 70 workers at the warehouse to get a sense of their desires. An overwhelming 90 percent said they wanted the option of full-time work. The employee who attended the petition submission says Amazon has given them the \u201crunaround\u201d when they\u2019ve pushed for changes in the past, but they\u2019re cautiously optimistic that their demands will have more force as the group grows.\n\n\u201cThere are quite a few things I think a lot of us wish would change or would improve,\u201d the employee says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that would be great if we could accomplish by banding together.\u201d\n\nUpdate October 4th, 3PM ET: After the petition was submitted, Sandra received a call from an Amazon representative informing her she had been rehired with back pay. \u201cSandra\u2019s rehiring shows without a doubt that Amazon workers have power when we work together and stand up for our dignity and rights at work,\u201d Amazonians United Sacramento posted in a Facebook message. Later, the second worker who had been fired for overdrawing her unpaid time off received an email saying she was rehired. However, the group says Amazon has not yet responded to its request to meet about changing the time-off policy.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s large workforce of part-time employees get no medical insurance and are allowed only short periods of unpaid time off.
