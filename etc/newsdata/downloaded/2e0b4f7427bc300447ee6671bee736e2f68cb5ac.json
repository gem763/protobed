'We watched the croc swim up behind the baby silently, the zebra had no idea it was there.\n\n'Next thing, the croc grabbed it and dragged it under and spun it.\n\n'I'd say the whole thing was over in about 30 seconds.'", "description": "Photographs taken from the banks of the river show how the predator stalked and conquered its prey with its sheer force in the steady-flowing waters of the Mara River in Kenya's Narok County.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/19834368-0-image-a-19_1571312352240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
