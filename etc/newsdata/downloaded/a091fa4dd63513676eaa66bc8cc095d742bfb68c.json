The U.S., locked in a trade war with China, is campaigning against Huawei equipment, saying it poses security risks for countries because the company is too close to China\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen with Huawei and the U.S. and China and the U.S.,\u201d Adriansyah said in an interview Monday in Jakarta. \u201cWe use all major vendors in the world, so we can wait and see. We can go in any direction that we believe to be the best option for us.\u201d\n\nHow Huawei Became a Target (NYSE: ) for Governments: QuickTake\n\nThe Trump administration has blacklisted China\u2019s largest technology company while accusing it of aiding Beijing in espionage. The U.S. has also curbed sales of technology Huawei has used in some of its phones and telecommunications equipment, creating the risk that customers of the company won\u2019t be able to update software in its devices.\n\nHuawei has been one of the Indonesian carrier\u2019s key equipment suppliers.\n\nWith the smartphone penetration estimated at only 70% and far-flung regions in the vast archipelago still using 2G services, Indonesia will be behind regional markets such as Singapore, Thailand and South Korea in introducing 5G services, Adriansyah said.\n\nTelkomsel, the state-company\u2019s mobile unit, had 168 million subscribers at the end of June with two-thirds of them using smartphones. The digital business accounted for 62% of the unit\u2019s revenue in the first half and was set to grow at a steady pace, Adriansyah said.\n\nThe Indonesian carrier may post an increase in net income this year that\u2019s \u201cslightly better\u201d than the group\u2019s revenue growth guidance of mid-to-high single digits, said Adriansyah, who took over as the group CEO in July. An end to a bruising price war among operators has allowed the company to selectively increase prices, he said.\n\nIntensifying competition for mobile services last year saw operators from PT XL Axiata, PT Indosat and PT Smartfren Telecom posting losses. But the tide has turned with the operators now maintaining stable subscriber bases, Adriansyah said.\n\nThe market may become healthier if the government succeeds in nudging operators to consolidate, Adriansyah said.\n\n\u201cThe sooner the consolidation happens the better for everyone,\u201d Adriansyah said. \u201cThe market will be getting healthier and there would be no price war.\u201d", "description": "Southeast Asia\u2019s Biggest Phone Carrier Still Open to Huawei 5G", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic1a7efc02921a52d04fcf0299338ff130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
