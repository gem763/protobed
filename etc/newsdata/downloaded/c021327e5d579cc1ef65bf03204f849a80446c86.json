Jeez.'\n\nJohnny and Loo, who featured in last night's episode of Channel 4's Location, Location, Location, had their offer accepted on a \u00a3325k two-bed house in Weybridge\n\nIn last night's episode, the couple explained how they were on the search for a carbon copy of their two-bed mid-century style flat which they were renting.

Pictured, the bedroom after the transformation\n\nViewers took to social media to express their strong opinions on the cost of the small flat. '\u00a3325k for a small, ugly 1960s style flat in Weybridge. Jeez,' wrote one. Pictured, the bathroom before\n\nTeacher Loo admitted she took Kirstie's advise and tried to make the bathroom look bigger by hanging two mirrors opposite each other\n\nViewers were shocked by the size of the houses the couple could afford for their reasonable \u00a3335k budget (pictured)\n\nA third added: 'Mad how the're talking about value for money at \u00a3350k in a tiny flat. Money's crazy.'\n\nThe couple dreamed of buying a carbon copy of their two-bed mid-century style flat which they were renting, with ample storage and parquet flooring.\n\n'What you're looking for is very realistic architecturally in terms of what's available in the area, but not in your range,' said presenter Kirstie Allsopp.\n\nAnd the first house Johnny and Loo visited in Weybridge, which was under budget at \u00a3325k, was in the perfect location with a south-facing terrace - but sacrificed other elements.\n\n'Standing here, we're either going to be compromising on size or condition,' joked Kirstie. 'And obviously I know which because I've seen the flat.'\n\nHighlighting the perks, the presenter told how the house offered open plan living, was freshly decorated and offered loads of natural light, masses of built-in storage and a loft - not to mention the parquet flooring.\n\nBefore heading inside to the first house, Kirstie warned: 'Standing here, we're either going to be compromising on size or condition. And obviously I know which because I've seen the flat.'

Pictured after\n\nHowever, there was no denying by anyone that the kitchen was a little on the compact size.\n\n'How keen a cook are you?' asked Kirstie, before continuing: 'Have you ever cooked on a boat or ship?'\n\nAfter taking a look, Johnny, who works in marketing, joked: 'There's enough room to swing a cat, so that's all good.'\n\nAnd those who tuned into the show couldn't believe the price of the property considering its size, either.\n\n'\u00a3325k for scruffy looking council flat with \u201csouth facing terrace,\u201d wrote one, while another penned: 'Am watching #locationlocationlocation with \u00a3320k houses being looked at in Weighbridge and thinking about my \u00a395k three-bed maisonette on Bute wondering if I'm doing it wrong...?'\n\nThe second house the couple viewed, which was twenty minutes outside of Weybridge, meant it was 70 per cent bigger than the last, and \u00a3290k under-budget - but they were left unimpressed.\n\nWhile Johnny admitted the size of the kitchen (pictured) wasn't an issue for him, he also joked: 'there's enough room to swing a cat'\n\nTowards the end of the episode, the couple revealed that two-and-a-half years are purchasing the property, they had welcomed a baby. Pictured, the second bedroom before\n\nThe second bedroom since the couple's new arrival has been converted into a colourful nursery\n\n'The space is very good but I don't quite feel the charm the first place had,' admitted Johnny.\n\nAnd the final property was a modern flat two-bedroom flat in the 'very good location' of Weybridge, which was on the market for a staggering \u00a3350k.\n\n'Put your blinkers on, every square inch of the flat has got stuff,' warned Kirstie, before they headed inside.\n\nWhile the experts suggested the two-bed ground floor flat had huge potential for starting a family, with loads of built-in storage - viewers struggled to see potential in any of the three houses.\n\n'\u00a3317k for a flat just to stay within London, f**** ridiculous,'commented one, while a further penned: '\u00a3400,000 for a flat. Move north and enjoy a proper home with expendable cash.'\n\n\n\nIn the end, the couple decided to go ahead with the first house and had their offer of \u00a3317k accepted.\n\nAnd towards the end of the programme, it showed their transformation two-and-a-half years on - including the second bedroom being converted into their three-month-old baby's nursery.\n\nBut even Loo admitted to following one of Kirstie's top tips to try and make the tiny bathroom in their flat look bigger.\n\n'Kirstie suggested putting two mirrors opposite each other to make it look bigger, so we installed them in and it does create more light and more space,' she said.", "description": "Johnny and Loo bought a \u00a3325k two-bedroom flat in Weybridge for \u00a3317k - but viewers took to Twitter to express their shock at how little they could get in the area for their hefty price tag.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19538132-0-image-a-7_1570709911906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
