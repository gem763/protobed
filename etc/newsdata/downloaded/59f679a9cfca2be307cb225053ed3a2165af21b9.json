Neuroplasticity.\n\nThese rats were taught to drive a car.\n\n\n\nFind out why here:https://t.co/fhS8f8tCG6pic.twitter.com/IXf5qJVcfo \u2014 IFLScience (@IFLScience) October 23, 2019\n\nResearchers have long been fascinated by the changes in the brain in response to experience and challenges, including stressful situations. They therefore decided to compare groups of \u2018stimulated\u2019 rats against their lab-bound counterparts to test their overall stress levels and mood.\n\nAlso on rt.com Not just Baltimore: American cities have a HUGE rat problem\n\nLambert and her colleagues modified a small robot car by adding a plastic food container to the driver cabin, an aluminum floor, and a rudimentary steering mechanism made of copper wire.\n\nOnce the rat stood in place and gripped the wire, the circuit was completed and the car began to move in the selected direction. Some 17 such \u2018racer rodents\u2019 were trained over the course of several months to drive around a 150x60cm plexiglass arena.\n\nThe animals were first taught to drive forward intentionally, before eventually learning more complex manoeuvres. When feces were tested for the stress hormone corticosterone as well as dehydroepiandrosterone, which counters stress, rats that underwent the \u2018crash course\u2019 had higher levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, indicating a more relaxed state of mind than their lab-locked compatriots.\n\nAlso on rt.com Scientists grow first ever HUMAN-MONKEY embryo in \u2018promising\u2019 step for organ harvesting\n\nThe researchers also found that rat drivers had even higher levels of dehydroepiandrosterone than mere passengers, indicating that the satisfaction of mastering a new skill also further improved their mood.\n\n\u201cIt was actually quite shocking to me that they were so much better,\u201d Lambert said.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
