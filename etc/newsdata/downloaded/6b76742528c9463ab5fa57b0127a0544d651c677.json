Then it got a trade boost as U.S.-China relations soured.\n\nAustralia ships around a third of its exports to China, mostly commodities such as iron ore and coal that are used by heavy industry and in the building of apartments. Those exports are in demand as Beijing accelerates construction spending to head off damage caused by Washington raising tariffs.\n\nTrade has been so buoyant that Australia logged its first current-account surplus\u2014a measure of trade and financial flows with other countries\u2014since 1975 in the second quarter of this year. That has provided some much-needed juice to Australia\u2019s economy, on a 28-year run without a recession, as other headwinds to growth intensify. Australia\u2019s gross domestic product expanded at its slowest pace since the financial crisis in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a contradiction,\u201d said AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver. \u201cWe are hearing all this talk about trade wars, which should obviously affect trade, and yet we have a record trade surplus that\u2019s been far greater than anyone expected.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s trade experience is unusual for a U.S. ally, some of whose economies have become collateral damage in the trade dispute. Germany\u2019s exports in June fell 8% on a year earlier, and its current-account surplus has declined.\n\nGlobal trade volumes grew 4.4% in the first quarter of 2018, when the first U.S. tariffs were imposed, from the same period a year before, according to the International Monetary Fund. But growth had slowed sharply by year\u2019s end, with trade up 1.6% in the fourth quarter from the prior year. Trade volumes fell 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the same period a year ago.\n\nInvestors are skittish, evidenced by a global selloff of equities last month and the yield on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond falling to a record low.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think the U.S.-China trade war will cause lasting changes to global trade? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe trade war continues to take twists and turns. Chinese and American officials last week agreed to meet next month for high-level trade talks, although expectations for a breakthrough are low. The U.S. is in the process of introducing additional levies on clothing and other imports from China, while China is retaliating with its own measures.\n\nTo be sure, a sharper slowdown in global growth would hurt Australia. Businesses could become more reluctant to invest, consumers unwilling to spend and foreign demand for Australian goods could weaken.\n\nMuch depends on Beijing\u2019s response. \u201cThe domestic stimulus in China to offset the trade dispute has contributed to a short-term boost to the Australian economy and significantly mitigated the impact of the trade disputes on us,\u201d Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said on Aug. 15.\n\nAustralia has logged a 30% rise in nominal exports to China since early last year, around the time the U.S. tariffs were first imposed, said J.P. Morgan, which thinks Beijing would again turn to stimulus rather than risk a deeper economic slowdown.\n\nAdding ballast to that view is how Australia\u2019s economy behaved during the financial crisis a decade ago. China\u2019s huge economic-stimulus program drove up prices of iron ore\u2014Australia\u2019s No. 1 export\u2014and helped to prevent a recession Down Under.\n\nThe iron-ore price has surged again this year. It rose 74% in roughly six months to a peak in July, as Chinese mills churned out steel at record rates to support the national economy and the market adjusted to supply cutbacks in Brazil.\n\nWhile iron-ore prices have fallen by almost a third since then to US$88 a metric ton, some forecasters think they won\u2019t decline much further, and might even rebound.\n\nInvestors fearful of global recession risks have also been buying gold. That is good for Australia, which counts the precious metal among its top exports.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia appears to be benefiting from tighter U.S. visa procedures for Chinese students. Growth in higher-education enrollments by Chinese students in Australia far outpaced the U.S. in 2017-2018, said Australian education provider Navitas.\n\nThe question is whether Australia\u2019s terms of trade have peaked. Many economists think the drop in iron-ore prices means it won\u2019t be long before Australia returns to a current-account deficit.\n\nAustralia is also vulnerable if Beijing calibrates its trade response to hurt Washington\u2019s allies.\n\nFor months now, Australian coal cargoes have struggled to pass Chinese ports quickly\u2014a headache for miners and widely viewed as a political maneuver by Beijing. Australia irked China by tightening laws on political interference, and banning Huawei and ZTE from its 5G telecommunications network.\n\nAustralia faces bottlenecks that restrict its ability to displace U.S. exports to China. A severe drought means Australia can\u2019t quickly add production of many farm goods. Most exports of liquefied natural gas are locked into 20-year contracts with other Asian customers.\n\nThere are also questions around the limits of China\u2019s ability to stimulate its economy.\n\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t take China stimulus for granted,\u201d said IBISWorld senior industry analyst Jason Aravanis.\n\nWrite to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com and James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.com", "description": "Australia was needing an economic pick-me-up, and it got one as U.S.-China trade relations soured.
