That split would mean both parties fall short of the 61 needed for a governing majority.\n\nLieberman was forecast to capture 8-10 seats, up to double his current tally in parliament, making him the linchpin.\n\nThe election was called after Netanyahu, 69, failed in efforts to cobble together a coalition following an April ballot in which Likud and Blue and White wound up in a dead heat, each taking 35 parliamentary seats. It is the first time Israel has had two general elections in a single year.\n\nThe two main parties' campaigns pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues: the regional struggle against Iran, the Palestinian conflict, relations with the United States and the economy.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era, after a decade in power, would be unlikely to bring about a significant change in policy on hotly disputed issues in the peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nNetanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians seek statehood.\n\nBut Blue and White has also said it would strengthen Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank, with the Jordan Valley as Israel's \"eastern security border\". The Palestinians and many countries consider the settlements to be illegal.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's battle for political survival looked set to stretch on for days or weeks after exit polls following Tuesday's election showed the race too close to call.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106133181-1568701420877gettyimages-1168758313.jpeg?v=1568701481", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
