Clearly, you shouldn't own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCain offered a retort less than 20 minutes later, again employing O'Rourke's legal name and tweeting: \u201cYou\u2019re a child Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nO'Rourke said in an interview later Friday morning that his campaign staff had contacted the FBI and Twitter regarding Cain's tweet.\n\n\"I mean, anytime you have somebody threatening to use violence against somebody in this country to resolve a political issue, or really for any reason, that's a matter for law enforcement,\" O'Rourke told CNN.\n\n\"But it really drives home the point better than I could have made,\" he continued. \"Rep. Briscoe Cain is making the case that no one should have an AR-15 that they can hold over someone else in this country \u2014 say, 'Look, if we disagree on something, let me introduce you to my AR-15.' Absolutely wrong.\"\n\nNational Democrats and some Republicans have pushed for various gun reform policies following a spate of mass shootings over the summer in California, Texas and Ohio.\n\nAll of the Democratic candidates vying to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 support instituting a system of universal background checks and an assault weapons ban \u2014 with some promoting a mandatory buyback of the firearms and others in favor of a voluntary program.", "description": "State Rep.
