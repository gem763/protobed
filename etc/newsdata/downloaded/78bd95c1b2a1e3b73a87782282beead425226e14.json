At that moment, Astros slugger Yordan Alvarez\u2019s bullet of a home run was hurtling toward him. With little time to react, Adams froze and reverted to his days as a catcher, growing up in Miami.\n\n\u201cI had a Little League coach, his name was Wayne Mitchell,\u201d Adams said, standing in front of the in-stadium restaurant. \u201cHe taught me how to put my chest in front of a ball and let it bounce in front of me. So put my chest in front of it, right? And I angled down. Sure enough, hit me right in the chest. Went straight down. And I got it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGood job getting in front of this baseball and protecting the beer, my guy. pic.twitter.com/dkQLZPjaMp \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 28, 2019\n\nAdams\u2019s perfect form yielded barely a spilled drop of suds, and the ball rested on the ground in front his seat. He picked it up. In the middle innings, he asked a reporter, \u201cYou want to see it?\u201d He pulled a ball out of his pocket \u2014 the ball, Adams said \u2014 and proudly showed it off. His wished his mom could see him, and he gave all credit to Mitchell, his old coach.\n\n\u201cThis guy taught me how to do that,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, Adams nearly caught another ball. Juan Soto\u2019s seventh-inning home run headed out in his direction, and Adams learned over a railing to try to snag it, but the homer landed in an open space between the fence and the seats.\n\nAD\n\nJuan Soto puts the Nats on the board with a solo homer\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa5: @MLBpic.twitter.com/prw6DpLibI \u2014 Post Sports (@PostSports) October 28, 2019\n\nAdams said he lives in the District now and frequently attends Nationals games. He had never gained any level of fame, and he was a little uneasy about it. But he had a unique souvenir to bring home. He likely had a bruise, too, but he swore it didn\u2019t hurt.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a World Series baseball. I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI had a Little League coach, his name was Wayne Mitchell,\u201d Jeff Adams said. \u201cHe taught me how to put my chest in front of a ball and let it bounce in front of me.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RW7sc7pJeyLNcHivHN35WZVuOvw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PMQTURMBHJD2XA4TPTDA2GE54E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
