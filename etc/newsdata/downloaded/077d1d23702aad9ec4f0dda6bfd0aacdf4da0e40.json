Roads were surfaced and finished in individual cul de sacs as we progressed.'\n\nShe said the service charges were paid to a management company not to Morris but that roads would be upkept by the local authority.", "description": "Waterside Village locals in St Helens claim Morris Homes has forgotten about them after building the 500-house\u00a0estate ten years ago and leaving roads unfinished.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/13/19394194-0-image-a-6_1570450089018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
