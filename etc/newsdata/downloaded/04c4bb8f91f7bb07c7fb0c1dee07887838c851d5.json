We don\u2019t care, you deserve it.\u2019 Because everybody talked about how you looked or how you dressed or the jokes you made.\u201d\n\nMs. Fox, who has three children with husband Brian Austin Green, went on to discuss Hollywood\u2019s treatment of mothers and her perception of #MeToo gatekeeping.\n\n\u201cEven though I consider myself a feminist, I feel like feminists don\u2019t want me to be a part of their group,\u201d the actress said. \u201cWhat is supporting other females if there is only certain ones of us we support? If I have to be an academic or have to be non-threatening to you in some way? Why can\u2019t I be a part of the group as well?\u201d\n\nShe added that feelings of ostracism were exacerbated after having children.\n\n\u201cBeing a mother is not something really respected in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything it\u2019s considered as a handicap. And that\u2019s unfortunate because it\u2019s not acknowledged, what we\u2019re juggling, what we\u2019re doing. \u2026 I get this all the time, people will be like, \u2018You just don\u2019t really work that much. And it\u2019s like, I have given birth, I have gestated and given birth to three children. I starred in a movie that opened worldwide, number one \u2014 twice! I was on a critically acclaimed sitcom. I f\u2014king executive produced and created a show about archaeological controversies! How much more f\u2014king productive does a f\u2014king woman need to be?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
