Astronauts will wear a much bigger mostly white suit on the lunar surface.\n\nAmy Ross, NASA's lead spacesuit engineer, said the new suits make it much easier to walk, bend and squat when walking on the lunar surface.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"Basically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment, and give them the mobility to do their job,'' she said.\n\nThe new suits come as a much-needed upgrade to NASA's astronaut wardrobe.\n\nAstronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain were slated in March to conduct the first ever all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station.\n\nHowever, the mission was called off because there weren't enough spacesuits available on the station for both of them.\n\nAnother attempt for the first all-female spacewalk, a roughly six-hour crawl on the exterior of the space station to install new batteries, is back on for Thursday.", "description": "NASA's new spacesuits were designed with women in mind as the agency prepares to land the first female on the moon", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588545.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-space.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
