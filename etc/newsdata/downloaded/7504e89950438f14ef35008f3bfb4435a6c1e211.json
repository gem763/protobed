Mainly, the interweb cannot shut up about Zendaya's Poison Ivy dress, and her look was so gorgeous that the Smithsonian needs to hang a portrait of her in their halls for always and eternity. But aside from that, people also can't stop talking about how Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner presented an award tonight and everyone laughed at them. Lucky for Kylie Jenner, she was able to dodge all the awkwardness because she skipped the entire show.\n\nIn case you don't have cable and didn't make another email account just to get a free streaming trial to watch, Kim and Kendall got up on stage to introduce the award for Outstanding Reality TV and said they're \"real people\" who tell \"unfiltered and unscripted\" stories. As anyone who has watched Keeping Up With the Kardashians knows, Kris Jenner is a mastermind and has been accused of faking plot lines, so that little spiel they gave was truly LOL. The hilarity of it all didn't escape the audience, who let out a collective laugh despite Kim and Kendall's serious tone.\n\nDid the audience laugh when Kim Kardashian said \u201cour family knows first hand how truly compelling TV comes from real people just being themselves\u201d?

According to a People source, Kylie actually had a really good reason for skipping the Emmys, though. They didn't go into any details, but she's sick and resting right now.\n\nMeanwhile, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is live-tweeting the new episode of KUWTK. Such an eventful night for the Kardashian-Jenner clan!\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Okay, that's actually a good reason.", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/16z6FJ3EfPQEVnOxxlDqJg--~B/aD00OTQ7dz05ODQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/276b29943223bbeeb91dfeaab488d202", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
