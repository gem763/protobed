Mac subsequently published the email, which Musk had prefaced with \"off the record\" (Mac had not agreed to an off-the-record exchange in advance).\n\nRead more: Elon Musk hired a PI to dig up dirt on cave diver Vernon Unsworth. That guy is reportedly a convicted felon.\n\nThe new court documents from Unsworth's lawyers include emails Musk sent to a PR agent after the debacle, revealing how he came to regret his extraordinary allegations against the cave diver. \"I didn't expect Buzzfeed to publish an off the record email. My intent was to have them investigate and come to their own conclusions, not publish my email directly. Still, I'm a f--king idiot,\" Musk wrote.\n\n\"In the past, Buzzfeed has respected emails prefaced with 'off the record,' but this time they did not. It was still one of the dumbest things I've ever done,\" he added.\n\nThe twelve boys and their soccer coach were rescued from a flooded cave system in July last year. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun\n\nUnsworth's lawyers allege that Musk and Mac's interaction was not the only example of the CEO trying to feed stories to the press about Unsworth.\n\nA private eye hired by Musk to dig into Unsworth, James Howard-Higgins, was also tasked with feeding information surreptitiously back to the press, the new documents indicate. An email to Howard-Higgins from the head of Musk's family office, Jared Birchall, said: \"We would like you to immediately move forward with 'leaking' this information to the UK press. Obviously must be done very carefully.\"\n\nA previous set of documents in the case first revealed that Musk had hired Howard-Higgins to defend himself, and BuzzFeed subsequently reported last week that Howard-Higgins has a history of fraud. In a deposition, Musk said he realised the reports he was sending back to Musk's family office were \"just taking us for a ride.\"\n\nUnsworth's UK lawyer Mark Stephens alleged to Business Insider that Musk's email to BuzzFeed News and Howard-Higgins' instructions to leak to the press show a common attempt to manipulate the media without explicitly naming Musk as the source of the information. \"It's exactly the same strategy,\" he said.\n\nUnsworth's lawyers also claim that Howard-Higgins never gave Musk any information about Unsworth marrying a twelve-year-old. \"Nothing in [Howard-Higgins'] report would reflect or give grounds to say that,\" said Stephens.\n\nHere's the full legal filing:", "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his emailed attacks on cave diver Vernon Unsworth were \"one of the dumbest things I've ever done.\"", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c764f55824d450b72b034?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
