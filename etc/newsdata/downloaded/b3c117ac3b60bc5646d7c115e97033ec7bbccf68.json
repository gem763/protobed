But they're using fox hunting as a smokescreen to cause trouble. They're nothing more than thugs.\n\n'They have absolutely no right to come down my driveway when I'm with my children.'\n\nRebekah Uden, 31, who has never been on a hunt in her life, was 'shaken with anger' to return home and find five men blocking entry to her Trefnant, north Wales property\n\nMs Uden said that her husband Dave, 35, and other residents warned them they were not allowed on the lane as they cruised down in their Range Rover.\n\nBut she claims that the men laughed off these warnings and continued down the gravel road to see if the local hunting party were operating there.\n\nMs Uden quickly called the police and waited in her car with her children for them to arrive.\n\nYet when the men got out of their car and began lingering in her driveway, she angrily decided to challenged them.\n\nIn her video, she says: 'You're not here to because you love foxes, you're here for a bit of drama. You're not from the countryside, I've been here my whole life.\n\n'I'm fuming, I'm shaking with anger. This is my drive, you're on my property.'\n\nWhen the 'intimidated' mother demanded the mob - led by convicted thug Paul Allman - remove their masks, they yelled at her to 'f*** off'\n\nAt one point, one of the men boots a football across the front yard, prompting Mr Uden to shout: 'Leave my lad's ball alone! You're just causing trouble.'\n\nThe tracksuit-clad men relentlessly berate the mother and demand that she move her own car, which was blocking them from leaving.\n\nMs Uden said that she did not have space to move the car, and also that she refused to budge because she was waiting for the police to arrive.\n\nShe said: 'Luckily the police came quickly and told the sabs to clear off. They're following it up and might be taking statements.'\n\nAnd she added: 'I feel quite worried that they [the saboteurs] will come back.'\n\nBut the men, who are members of the Stockport Monitors anti-hunting group, insist that they reasonably asked Ms Uden to allow them to leave when she flew into a rage.\n\nPaul Allman, who was this year convicted of an assault on a master huntsman, told MailOnline that they were following the local hunt when they drove down what they believed was a public road.\n\nThe members from anti-hunting group Stockport Monitors was led by Paul Allman (right and left arguing with Dave Uden) who was this year convicted of assaulting a huntsman\n\nHe claimed nobody told him it was a private lane, and, upon discovering that it led to a dead end, turned around in Ms Uden's property.\n\nAnd when the mother's car came down the driveway and blocked them in, Mr Allman said they asked her if she could move so they could go back on to the main road.\n\nThe saboteur said that mother began screaming and shouting at them, and was impossible to reason with.\n\nHe said that some of the group choose to cover their faces so they cannot be identified.\n\nBut, after looking at the video Countryside Alliance chief executive Tim Bonner, said: 'I can't begin to imagine how frightening this experience must have been for Rebekah, her husband and of course, her young children.\n\n'These cowards hide behind balaclavas to frighten and intimidate members of the public. They are bullies and couldn't care less about animals.'\n\nA spokesperson for North Wales Police confirmed it is investigating the incident.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Rebekah Uden, 31, who has never been on a hunt in her life, was 'shaken with anger' to return home and find five men blocking entry to her Trefnant, north Wales property.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20286036-0-image-a-22_1572277791075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
