Climate Talks, Get Their Chance to Answer Youth Protests", "language": "en", "text": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Just days after angry youth protests demanding swift action to fight climate change, the United Nations climate summit opened Monday, where dozens of presidents, prime ministers and corporate executives sought to highlight their efforts to reduce planet-warming emissions .\n\nNo sooner had it begun than the teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, her voice quavering like it rarely does, lit into them, excoriating world leaders for their \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach to bringing down greenhouse gas emissions at a time when temperatures are swiftly rising. \u201cThe eyes of all future generations are upon you,\u201d she said, visibly angry . \u201cIf you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.\u201d\n\nThroughout the morning came a series of incremental promises and a great many boasts.\n\nChina, currently the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouses gases, noted that it was meeting its targets under the Paris Agreement, the pact among nations to jointly fight climate change , but stopped short of promising quicker, stronger targets as many had hoped.\n\nIndia\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, said his country would increase its share of renewable energy by 2022 , without making any promises to reduce its dependence on coal. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany promoted a new plan worth $60 billion over 10 years to speed a transition to clean power. Britain , Norway, Costa Rica and 12 other countries will promise to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Collectively, the promises were a signal of how much other countries are willing to do in the face of inaction by the United States, which is responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial age.", "description": "Dozens of presidents, prime ministers and corporate executives will try to show that they are stepping up action to reduce planet-warming emissions.", "authors": ["Lisa Friedman", "Somini Sengupta"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/climate/23CLI-SUMMIT1b/23CLI-SUMMIT1b-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
