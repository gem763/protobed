We think so", "language": "en", "text": "Cape Town \u2013 After the ITV documentary revealed the toll the negative press has had on Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan, many other unknown pressures came to light, while concerns surrounding the royal couple and the royal family, took centre stage. The rumoured rift between William and Harry was at the forefront of all the drama.\n\nIn Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, the Duke of Sussex addressed his relationship with his brother and told ITV's Tom Bradby, \"Inevitably stuff happens. But we're brothers, we'll always be brothers.\n\n\"We're certainly on different paths at the moment, I'll always be there for him and as I know, he'll always be there for me. We don't see each other as much as we used to because we're so busy, but I love him dearly.\n\n\"The majority of stuff is created out of nothing,\" he said. \"As brothers, we have good days, and we have bad days.\"\n\nWATCH THE CLIP HERE:\n\n'As brothers you have good days, you have bad days'\n\n\n\nPrince Harry says the 'majority of stuff' written about his relationship with his brother William is 'created out of nothing' and adds: 'I love him dearly' #HarryAndMeghan https://t.co/GWs5KfuovM pic.twitter.com/bW7GVALZR6 \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) October 20, 2019\n\nMeghan admitted that she too tried to \"adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip\", but it's been really \"damaging\". She says that she never thought being part of the royal family would be easy, but sometimes, after everything she's been through, it just doesn't seem fair.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry on rumoured rift with William: 'We're certainly on different paths'\n\nRoyal watchers and experts have been speculating whether or not William and Kate reached out to Harry and Meghan after the documentary. Some feel Kate is opting to stay out of the situation, while others think it'd be impossible to not get in touch after seeing the couple break down. We believe it's the latter.\n\nAccording to royal reporter Phil Dampier, Kate, specifically, is making an effort behind the scenes. \"None of them want to let the Queen down so Kate is trying to patch things up in private. I'm told she has reached out to Meghan and spoken to her on the phone. Kate feels sorry for her and knows that Meghan is struggling.\"\n\nAccording to a source close to the royals told People, William likely reached out to Harry too. A palace official did tell the BBC he is \"worried\" about his brother being \"in a fragile place\".\n\nAlthough the Duke of Cambridge has yet to make a public statement, they said, \"Watching that, it would be hard not to have compassion and want to check in and see if they're okay. That's a very human reaction.\"\n\nVanity Fair said it best though when they speculated if Kate and William have in fact reached out. Erin Vanderhoof writes:\n\n\"So far this mostly sounds like Kate and Meghan and William and Harry are behaving like what they are: old millennials. It's as though Meghan and Harry posted about having a tough time on Facebook and to reassure them, Kate and William just slid into the DMs, rather than making a big deal about it. Kate has also spoken about the stress she has felt as a mother, so it stands to reason that she might even have some advice to share.\"\n\nNevertheless, time will tell whether the Cambridge and Sussex families have managed to connect, or rather, reconnect \u2013 and we may get an answer sooner than expected.\n\nThough they've gone their separate ways with their respective charities, they still have official engagements to carry out as the royal family, and this weekend they'll both be in attendance at the traditional cathedral ceremony for Remembrance Sunday. We're sure Kate and Meghan will have a moment to chat, and William will have the opportunity to check in on Harry \u2013 even if he hasn't until now. As Harry said, they'll always be there for one another. They'll always be brothers.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)", "description": "Forget the rift \u2013 We think Kate and William have reached out to Meghan and Harry.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8502/0e105ed3ea7a48af9e4a34ca070b0128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
