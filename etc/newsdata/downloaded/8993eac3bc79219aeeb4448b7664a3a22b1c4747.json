It\u2019s unknown how the church\u2019s position will impact the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing\u2019s pending decision. The agency has said the rule could go into effect as early as next week.\n\nThe division didn\u2019t immediately respond to inquiries Wednesday.\n\nTroy Williams, executive director of the LGBTQ rights group Equality Utah, said he is surprised by the church\u2019s stance since the rule was already revised to align with the failed legislation. His group is reaching out the church to see if more changes could be made to address its concerns while keeping the substance intact.\n\n\u201cWe do not treat gender dysphoria with conversion therapy, that is dangerous and unethical,\u201d said Williams, pointing to research linking \u201cidentity conversion efforts\u201d to increased odds of suicide attempts among transgender adults.\n\nThe church said it denounces any \u201cabusive\u201d treatment and that it \u201chopes that those who experience same-sex attraction and gender dysphoria find compassion and understanding from family members.\u201d\n\nThe opposition comes after one of the religion\u2019s top leaders, Dallin H Oaks, said this month that a person\u2019s gender assigned at birth is \u201cessential to the plan of salvation\u201d and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhy same-sex attraction and confusion about sexual identity occur\u201d.\n\nHis remarks were reminiscent of a time in the 1970s when church scholars say the faith taught that homosexuality could be \u201ccured\u201d. The church has since said homosexuality is not a sin, though it remains opposed to same-sex marriage and intimacy.\n\nAt the public hearing last month, opponents of the proposal argued the rule would prevent parents from getting help for their children with \u201cunwanted\u201d homosexual feelings or even from talking about sexuality. Most of the opponents came from conservative-based groups.\n\nA parade of LGBTQ people urged the board to adopt the rule.\n\nNathan Dalley, 20, said he grew up a member of the faith and went through conversion therapy shortly after he turned 16. He said he was told to snap a rubber band on his wrist every time he felt attracted to men, and a therapist also scrutinized his posture, his walk, his gestures and interests. The experience deepened his feelings of depression and culminated in a suicide attempt.\n\n\u201cIt takes all these insecurities you have about yourself ... and convinces you they\u2019re accurate,\u201d he said Wednesday. He said church leaders haven\u2019t followed through on their position of neutrality.", "description": "Church says rule prohibiting psychologists from using LGBTQ conversion therapy would fail to safeguard \u2018religious beliefs\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aac0fe8e2088e633452f55aa5276d389b5023e5a/0_128_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c77bda6e6d3450afdefd03ca1b9b17aa", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
