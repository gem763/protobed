You had an obsession with her and you were infatuated with her.'\n\nShe said that having armed himself 'commando style', he had set out to 'fulfill his dream' of being alone with the girl.\n\nBut the judge said what he hadn't counted on that day was that her 17-year-old friend would be at the house.\n\nThe judge praised the actions of the friend that day who despite being assaulted by Irvine had continued to defend her friend and who at one point kicked him between his legs.\n\nIrvine, of Thor Drive in Bedford, appeared in court to be sentenced after a jury found him guilty in July of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence and sexual assault.\n\nHe admitted common assault on the girl's friend and possessing an offensive weapon.\n\nHe was acquitted of a charge of attempted rape and sentencing was adjourned for the preparation of reports to assess the danger he posed.\n\nIt was in August 2018 that he had first contacted the victim through a social media site and they had exchanged text conversations about school and exams.\n\nIn one message he told her: 'I mean if you are interested I might be able to make life a lil bit better.'\n\nShe replied and told him: 'I'm sorry but I have a boyfriend if that's what you are implying. I'm all up for being friends though.'\n\nHe also wore a balaclava (pictured) and latex gloves during the assault\n\nHe is said to have then said 'Ay that's fine I didn't know so I thought I'd see if you were interested before getting to know someone else if you get my meaning, no hard feelings.'\n\nThen on January 2 this year Irvine drove from his home in Bedford to the girl's secluded detached house in the mid-Bedfordshire countryside.\n\nThe girl's parents were out, but her 17-year-old friend was there and they were watching TV in her bedroom.\n\nThe day before, Irvine had sent a Snapchat text to the girl enquiring if she had a boyfriend, and asking 'how available' she was.\n\nWhen she replied she was 'out of a relationship,' he is alleged to have sent her a message saying: 'Well, I'm known to be very good at making girls happy x'.\n\nIn court she told the jury she hadn't replied, saying: 'It was a weird comment. It implied something I wasn't comfortable with.'\n\nAt 2.45pm that afternoon when there was a knock at the door the girls went downstairs from the bedroom.\n\nWhen the door was opened, a figure dressed in black wearing a balaclava and brandishing a knife was standing there.\n\nThe teenager said he continued to touch her in the drawing room of the house and upstairs in her bedroom with her friend present.\n\nShe said she pleaded with him to take any property he wanted, including iPhones and iPads, but he told her: 'Oh you wouldn't want your parents to come home and find everything's been taken, surely you just give me something in return.'\n\nThe girl went on: 'He wanted to come to my house and rape me. It's pretty clear, because when we left him he didn't take anything. Nothing was missing.'\n\nThe court was told the girl and her friend managed to escape from the house and raise the alarm after the friend kicked Irvine in the groin.\n\nIrvine also had a length of rope (pictured), tape, a black utility belt, a shoe lace, wet wipes, a lock pick and a change of clothing which his victim, from Bedfordshire, today described as a 'rape kit'\n\nIrvine ran off through a local wood and changed out of a black jumper he had been wearing and put on a blue hoodie.\n\nHe didn't get far and was quickly arrested by police who had responded to a 999 call.\n\nLater that day, when officers searched the defendant's home in Thor Drive Bedford, they found a notebook in his bedroom.\n\nThe jury heard that in it were a number of entries, but one entitled 'Forced Compliance' said: 'Given her complete disregard of respect towards us, we have no choice other than to force her to fulfill our needs. We have her address. Home address is the most opportune location.\n\n'However we still need to identify the exact house on her street and establish the best entry and exit points. This will require surveillance. A method to empty the house may be required, however the directness of this method is subject to change.'\n\nProsecutor Peter Shaw said the 'obvious inference' was that the entry related to the victim and his visit to her home on January 2.\n\nHe said: 'It's an extraordinary coincidence. It is entitled 'Forced Compliance.' How interesting that the defendant equipped himself with two knives and was happy to brandish a hunting knife.\n\n'One can consider his obviously frightening appearance in a balaclava and black clothing and what effect that would be likely on someone confronted with that view. Then consider the rope and tape he had with him.\n\n'The prosecution asks does that not sound like the equipment required for a forced compliance?'\n\nHe said he knew from the Snapchat messages that no boyfriend would be on the property.\n\nThe girl told the jury that at first when she saw the figure in the doorway wearing a balaclava and dressed in black with the knife, she wondered if it was a joke.\n\nBut she said he then walked towards her and began caressing her face and running his black latex gloved fingers through her hair before moving his hand to her chest area.\n\nThe court heard she could sum up the day when he came to her home with three words: 'Revulsion, anger and fear'.\n\nThe teenager told the jury the defendant told her: 'I came to get stuff, but you can persuade me not to take anything.'\n\nShe said he 'started to touch my boobs' and she said he traced the area of her left breast with his hand.\n\nThe girl described him as 'broad shouldered' and slim and told the jury: 'He had a similar accent to mine - it was posh.'\n\nIn the witness box Irvine, who at the time was working behind the bar at Bedford Blues Rugby Club, said he had only gone to the girl's home with the intention of scaring her.\n\nHe was asked why he had dressed all in black and put on the balaclava and he said he had wanted to create the image of a special forces soldier.\n\nHe denied he touched the girl's bottom or her breasts and denied he had tried to push her head towards his groin area.", "description": "Aaron Irvine, 19,\u00a0a former pupil at fee paying Bedford Modern School dressed all in black and wore a balaclava and latex gloves during the assault at the girl's secluded home in Bedfordshire countryside.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19316032-0-image-a-27_1570224657404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
