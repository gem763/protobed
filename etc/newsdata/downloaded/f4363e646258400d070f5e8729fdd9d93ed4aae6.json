He loved London at this time of year \u2013 the lengthening daylight hours meant you could always slip in a quick snifter \u2013 sorry, an \"important diplomatic information-gathering encounter\" \u2013 on the way back to the office. He\u2019d just left lunch with two bearded internet start-up wallies Malcolm had asked him to meet. What were they called? Alsatian Brooks? Atlas Cannon? Something daft like that. Alexander prided himself on being a good judge of character and an even better judge of business acumen and he could confidently predict that these two geeky hippies would be long forgotten and broke within six months. Still, lunch had been tolerable, mainly thanks to the Chateau Margaux.\n\nAlexander pulled up his collar and glanced over his shoulder. He\u2019d been looking forward to this encounter all week. This was where the action was! An intimate clandestine drink with one of the greatest political operatives in American history! A real player! Alexander, too, prided himself on his own political instincts, his own unerring grasp of the nuances of power, his own insights into the strategic plays of the Deep State\u2026\n\nA case of mistaken identity.\n\nWith his keen observational skills it only took Alexander a few minutes to spot the Mediterranean-looking gentleman sitting alone at the bar \u2013 although he made a mental note that the man looked a lot younger, more tanned and swarthier in the flesh than on Google. Must be those Mediterranean genes, he told himself. \u201cGeorge, so glad to meet you!\u201d Alexander gushed, thrusting out his hand. The man looked up. \u201cYou must be Mr\u2026?\u201d \u201cOh, just call me Your Excellency!\u201d Alexander chortled, employing his renowned diplomatic skills. He waved for the barman. \u201cWhat can I get you to drink, George? I\u2019m going for a large Russian Mule myself!\u201d His guest shrugged. \u201cMaybe a glass of chianti?\u201d Alexander nodded amiably, keen to put the man at ease. \u201cChianti? I\u2019m guessing your family originally came from that part of the world?\u201d The man frowned. \u201cEr, I\u2019m Greek, not Italian.\u201d Alexander felt like kicking himself. \u201cOf course, \u2018opoulos\u2019, there\u2019s a clue right there!\u201d he laughed, trying to cover his embarrassment as he fumbled for the iPhone in his trouser pocket. He liked to secretly record his diplomatic encounters so his assistant could transcribe all the key phrases and send them in the pouch to Canberra each week.\n\nHe knew Malcolm would be mightily impressed that he\u2019d scored a private tete-a-tete with the legendary George Stephanopoulos \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s top adviser and a key political player who\u2019d even inspired political best-sellers such as Primary Colors and TV shows such as House of Cards and The West Wing. Malcolm, of course, was a huge fan of any kind of Machiavellian political intrigue! But as they chatted, it struck Alexander how unimpressive Stephanopoulos was in person, sounding more like a rookie intern than one of the great practitioners of the dark arts. No doubt a clever ruse. Alexander decided to use his own renowned skills to surreptitiously nudge the conversation towards more fruitful political intrigues. \u201cI guess a man in your position has seen a few saucy emails in his time,\u201d he teased, casually waving for another vodka. \u201cClinton\u2019s, for example! I mean, there must have been some pretty fiery ones between Bill and Monica back in the day \u2013 you know, the sort of stuff you wouldn\u2019t want the Russians to get their hands on!\u201d he winked.\n\nThe man shrugged awkwardly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not even sure they had email back then, and, er, I\u2019m more of an expert on Donald Trump\u2019s foreign \u2026\u201d \u201cTRUMP!?!\u201d Alexander blurted out, spilling his vodka. \u201cWhat a dreadful, uncouth, hopeless buffoon that loser is! As I told Malcolm and Julie, Trump\u2019s got Buckley\u2019s of ever making it anywhere near the White House!\u201d He leaned forward and tapped his nose conspiratorially. \u201cThat\u2019s why Malcolm chose me for this job. Political insights! My antenna\u2019s never been sharper! For example, I told Malcolm he\u2019d be a phenomenal leader, and now, thanks to Snowy 2.0 and the NEG, he\u2019s never looked stronger! Stroke of genius! He\u2019ll be PM for at least a decade, mark my words! Plus, I always said Julie would make a superb foreign minister and I always predicted Christopher\u2019s French submarine deal was an absolute bargain!\u201d Alexander raised his vodka. \u201cHere\u2019s to the Russians, eh! And what\u2019s the bet they\u2019ve got every one of Clinton\u2019s private emails!\u201d he chortled merrily, still enjoying his own little joke.\n\nShortly afterwards, a baffled George Papadopoulos, a relatively unknown adviser on Trump\u2019s campaign team, made his excuses and hurriedly headed out into the cool Kensington night air.", "description": "It was the clink of glasses that was heard around the world.
