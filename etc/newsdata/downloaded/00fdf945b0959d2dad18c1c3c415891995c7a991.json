After jumping out to a 5-0 lead in the final set, she dropped two games before closing out the match.\n\nWith Gauff\u2019s victory, she became the youngest tennis player to win a WTA title since 2004.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still overwhelmed and shocked,\u201d Gauff told reporters Sunday. \u201cI guess it\u2019s crazy to say it\u2019s my first WTA title. This was definitely not on the calendar at the beginning of the year, because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have a chance to get in, and now I\u2019m the champion, so it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nGauff entered the tournament as a lucky loser after she replaced injured No. 6 seed Maria Sakkari. She initially failed to make the main draw after a straight-sets loss to Germany\u2019s Tamara Korpatsch in qualifying.\n\n@CocoGauff is your @WTALinz champion!\n\nThe 15-year-old defeats Jelena Ostapenko 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to claim her first WTA title! pic.twitter.com/i8ArqH6RnG\u2014 WTA (@WTA) October 13, 2019\n\nGauff earned a second-round victory over Kateryna Kozlova earlier in the week to secure a spot in the top 100 of the women\u2019s rankings. She beat No. 8 seed Kiki Bertens in straight sets in the quarterfinals before another straight-sets win over Andrea Petkovic in the semifinals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just literally insane that I got in as a lucky loser and now I\u2019m the champion,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cMy dad told me when I got in, before the first main-draw match: \u2018You can\u2019t lose twice in the same tournament.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he never thought it would come this far, to being the champion, but I guess he was right.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 American phenom Cori \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff claimed her first WTA tour title with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 win over Jelena Ostapenko on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
