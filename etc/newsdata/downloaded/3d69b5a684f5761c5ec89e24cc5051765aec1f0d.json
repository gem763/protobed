The word is a newly popular term in Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement: China + Nazi, a derogatory framing of Beijing\u2019s governance.\n\nAsofficials in Beijing seek to ward off dissent and mobilize the nation to sing its praises, protesters in Hong Kong are dancing to a different tune.\n\nHundreds of thousands attended two days of protests over the weekend that both rejected Beijing\u2019s influence and celebrated Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democratic history: a rally for the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Movement on Saturday and a \u201cglobal anti-totalitarianism\u201d march on Sunday.\n\nBoth became violent, with flareups across the city. On Saturday, police dispersed crowds with pepper spray after some protesters threw bricks at them, then stopped and searched young people wearing black in shopping and financial districts, making arrests that triggered angry confrontations.\n\n\u201cGangsters! Release them!\u201d passersby shouted.\n\nOn Sunday, police and protesters fought open street battles with tear gas, rubber bullets, bricks and Molotov cocktails, back and forth through Hong Kong Island\u2019s central streets.\n\nWhat started as a movement against an extradition bill that would have allowed deportation of suspected criminals to China has become a struggle between autonomy and autocratic control.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a Hong Kong internal issue. We are standing up for defending universal values, for democracy, for freedom, for justice, for the world and the next generation,\u201d said Shelley, 27, who was marching with her mother and, like most protesters, asked not to use her full name for protection from authorities and Beijing supporters.\n\n\u201cMany countries want to have peace even if it is superficial. They are tolerating what the Beijing government is doing,\u201d said a 22-year-old protester carrying a large U.S. flag. He asked to go by C, his first initial only.\n\n\u201cThey are treating the Uighurs very inhumanely. They are put in concentration camps,\u201d he said, referring to China\u2019s detention and forced re-education of more than a million minority Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang. \u201cThese actions should not be tolerated in the world right now. But they are letting it happen.\u201d\n\nA procession of protesters waved flags from the 17 countries where solidarity marches also took place on Sunday, including in rainy Taiwan, where more than 10,000 people marched in support of Hong Kong\u2019s movement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no blood, but it\u2019s a war,\u201d said Tsai Yu-Hsin, 32, holding a sign that said \u201cHold up Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nFor some older protesters, resistance to the Communist Party is personal.\n\nMany Hong Kongers were born in mainland China but fled to Hong Kong as refugees escaping the Communist Party\u2019s 1949 takeover and policies that led to mass famine and bloodshed including the massacre of student protesters in 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.\n\n\u201cI have no grudge against any Chinese national, but I know how the Communist system works,\u201d said Wong, 69, who was born in mainland China but grew up in Hong Kong. \u201cThey always hold that their authoritarian government is for the good of the people. But even Mao Tse-tung failed and failed miserably, and we know that.\u201d\n\nWong said his family, like many others in Hong Kong, sent food supplies to mainland China during the Cultural Revolution. Another protester, William Yun, 67, said he\u2019d done the same.\n\n\u201cMy father and grandfather, all the family members, shared what we had. Clothing, food, when they were in poor conditions, we shared back to the countrymen in red China,\u201d Yun said. \u201cWe helped \u2014 but now we are suppressed. It\u2019s very unfair to the Hong Kong people.\u201d\n\nYun said he supported those resisting Chinese encroachment of the post-1997 \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d agreement under which Hong Kong is part of China, but would be allowed to retain the high degree of autonomy it had under British rule for 50 years.\n\n\u201cThis is not an independence movement. This is only the cry of the people for justice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey suppose they are rich, they are the happiest \u2014 just like North Korea. They are the happiest people in the world, they think,\u201d Yun said of mainlanders. \u201cThey are birds in a cage.\u201d\n\nKen Chan, 24, said Beijing\u2019s heavy hand explains why only one of five demands, on the extradition bill, has been met after 17 weeks of mass protests.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Executive Carrie Lam has no way to make promises to Hong Kong people, because she has to ask for approval from the CCP,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want Hong Kong to be ruled by Hong Kong people.\u201d\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s protests, police jumped on demonstrators, in some cases grinding their faces into the ground. The protesters, meanwhile, hurled bricks and Molotov cocktails at the officers.\n\n\u201cWhen Hong Kong police enforce their rule, they are enforcing the rule of the CCP,\u201d said Louis, 23, who was throwing bricks at the police. \u201cThat\u2019s why we call them Communist dogs now.\u201d\n\nAuthorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have repeatedly condemned \u201cviolent rioters\u201d for actions like throwing bricks and have alleged that foreign \u201cblack hands\u201d are supporting them.\n\nBut recent polling by the Chinese University of Hong Kong shows 69% of Hong Kong citizens blame the government and police for escalating violence. An additional 12% blame protesters, and 12% blame foreign forces.\n\n\u201cThe government and police are very rough. They have pushed young people and Hong Kong citizens into a corner,\u201d said Frankie, 53, watching masses of protesters sprint away from police. \u201cIf you push the young people more, the young people will react more.\u201d\n\nHe said he would come out to march on Oct. 1, even though it was unlikely that Lam \u2014 who will be in Beijing for the 70th year anniversary and will return to Hong Kong at night \u2014 would give in to the other demands: investigation of police violence, amnesty for arrested protesters, retraction of the labeling of protests as \u201criots,\u201d and granting of universal suffrage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s four months now. At least one-third to half of Hong Kong people have come out to support everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very tiring. But we\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nSpecial correspondent Ralph Jennings contributed reporting from Taipei, Taiwan.
