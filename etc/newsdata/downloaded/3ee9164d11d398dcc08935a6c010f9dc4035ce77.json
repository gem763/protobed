But instead of the simple remedy, the Slighs -- and many other families -- fears' are multiplied now that the low-cost, generic medication is in short supply and doctors have started rationing its usage.\n\nThe shortage is especially frightening because there is no known drug available that is equally effective.\n\n\"We are greatly concerned that some children are already being impacted by this shortage and by the understandable anxiety this creates for all families of children with cancer,\" Dr. Peter Adamson, chair of the Children's Oncology Group, said in an open letter to the childhood cancer community just days ago. He went on to say this is \"an unacceptable crisis\" and he is \"infuriated that this situation has occurred at all.\"\n\n(MORE: Childhood cancer 'affects the entire family' mom writes in viral post)\n\n\"Every child with cancer whose treatment requires vincristine should receive the drug as scheduled,\" he added.\n\nA petition on WhiteHouse.gov has over 73,000 of the 100,000 signatures required in 30 days to get the White House to respond. The petition includes language like, \"Our children are going to start relapsing and dying at higher rates if we do not do something about this shortage immediately!\"\n\nEarlier this month, pharmacists started raising concerns about the ability to obtain vincristine. Pfizer, now the only supplier of the drug in the U.S., reported experiencing a shortage due to manufacturing delays. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Teva Pharmaceuticals made \"a business decision\" to stop supplying the medication in July 2019.\n\nPHOTO: Milo, a 4-year-old from South Carolina with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, requires vincristine, a crucial cancer drug that is in short supply. (Courtesy Marisa Sligh) More\n\nKelley Dougherty, vice president of corporate communications for Teva, told ABC News in a statement the company \"alerted the FDA of its decision [to stop manufacturing vincristine] in March 2019.\"\n\nPfizer told ABC News in a statement, \"We are expediting additional shipments of this critical product over the next few weeks to support three to four times our typical production output.\"\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, impacting about 3,000 children a year, most aged 2 to 5 years old. It occurs when the bone marrow makes too many immature white blood cells. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, easy bruising, bone pain, bleeding from the gums, swollen lymph nodes and frequent infections. Children need to be treated quickly with chemotherapy once a diagnosis is made.\n\nIn addition to chemotherapy, treatments can include radiation and targeted therapies, and \"around 98% of children with ALL go into remission within weeks after starting treatment and about 90% of those children can be cured,\" according to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\n\n(MORE: 11-year-old cancer survivor starts lemonade stand for pediatric cancer research)\n\nPatients are considered cured after 10 years in remission.\n\nMilo has responded well to his treatment, but Marisa worries that she may be told he can\u2019t get vincristine at his appointment in two months because of the shortage.\n\n\"Every time a dose is missed his chance for cure is decreased,\" she said.", "description": "When 4-year-old Milo Sligh, of Charleston, South Carolina, was diagnosed with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia the word \"cancer\" was frightening, but the prognosis was hopeful, according to his mother, Marisa.
