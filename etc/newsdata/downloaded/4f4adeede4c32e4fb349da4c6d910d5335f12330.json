Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s always people who talked to people who have talked to other people who think that he might have meant this. When you get direct evidence, this president is not only innocent, but he certainly has not done anything impeachable and it\u2019s time we bring this charade to a close.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/39/40/31cf92ac4b9a92e72b6d26d165cd/191028-schiff-newman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
