Pendley, a conservative lawyer with extreme anti-government and anti-environmentalism views, was a key figure in that movement as it gained momentum in the 1980s.\n\nIf you\u2019re writing for 21st Century Science & Technology, you\u2019re writing for people who really had some Nazi sympathies. Freelance journalist Dennis King, on Pendley's articles in a LaRouche magazine\n\nPendley joined the Trump administration in mid-July as deputy director for policy and programs at the Bureau of Land Management and by the end of the month was elevated to the role of acting director \u2015 thereby sidestepping the Senate confirmation process for the top BLM job. He\u2019s one of many high-ranking administration officials across the government with a history of battling the very agencies they now run.\n\nPendley\u2019s ascent came as LaRouche\u2019s organization reemerged in national politics with a stunt aimed to embarrass those arguing for a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy framework for combating the climate crisis. Earlier this month, a woman working with LaRouche PAC appeared at a town hall meeting that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) held in her home district, pleading with the freshman lawmaker to consider \u201ceating babies\u201d as a solution to curbing planet-heating emissions.\n\nThe stunt, immortalized in a viral video, was widely mocked. But the beliefs that Pendley, 74, espoused in his writings have largely gone mainstream in the Republican Party. At least eight states across the South and Midwest have enacted laws to increase criminal penalties for anti-fossil fuel protests, according to the International Center for Not-For-Profit Law, which tracks anti-protest legislation.\n\nThe progressive political action committee American Bridge first found \u2015 and shared exclusively with HuffPost \u2015 Pendley\u2019s previously unreported writings. But a HuffPost investigation surfaced more details about his ties to LaRouche, highlighting the degree to which once-marginal extremists now control key portions of the federal government\u2019s response to a rapidly worsening ecological collapse.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Lyndon LaRouche speaks to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington on May 5, 1988.\n\nWriting For LaRouche\n\nIn a 1992 letter to the editor printed in 21st Century Science & Technology, Pendley came to the defense of the Sahara Club, a radical anti-environmental group dedicated to \u201cfighting eco-freaks and keeping public lands free.\u201d Two years earlier, the BLM had charged several Sahara Club members with trespassing following a protest motorcycle ride through an area of the Mojave Desert that had been temporarily closed to protect the imperiled desert tortoise. The magazine painted the arrests as a BLM setup and claimed that the tortoise was threatened solely because the agency refused to deal with a growing population of predatory ravens. A BLM official responded with a scathing letter clarifying that raven predation was only one of the threats to the tortoise population and calling into question the magazine\u2019s journalistic integrity.\n\n\u201cWe found it astounding that such an article would be included in a publication supposedly dealing with science and technology,\u201d the official wrote, adding that an internationally known scientist had flagged the article to the BLM with a note that read, \u201cThis appears to be the journal of scientific disinformation!\u201d\n\nThe magazine also ran separate responses to the BLM official from the Sahara Club and Pendley. The Sahara Club claimed the federal agency closed the Mojave area as part of a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d it had against the club. Pendley accused the BLM of being a \u201cpushover\u201d for the Humane Society, which had filed a lawsuit challenging the government\u2019s proposed raven control program. \u201cRobbed of the only program that \u2015 according to the government\u2019s own documents \u2015 would have done the desert tortoise any good,\u201d Pendley wrote, \u201cthe government declared war upon the cattleman, the woolgrower, the miner, the off-highway vehicle (OHV) enthusiast and the City of Las Vegas.\u201d\n\nThe following year, Pendley wrote an article in the magazine slamming a federal judge who ruled that a Montana rancher could not claim self-defense in the killing of a protected grizzly bear. Pendley called the decision \u201ca frightening embrace, by an agency of the U.S. government, of the view of many animal rights fanatics and environmental zealots that human beings are only co-equal inhabitants of the planet, no better than any other creature.\u201d\n\nScreenshot/21st Century Science & Technology An article by William Perry Pendley in the Fall 1993 issue of 21st Century Science & Technology.\n\nThe magazine and another LaRouche publication, the Executive Intelligence Review, also ran a number of stories in the late 1980s and early 1990s highlighting the work of Pendley\u2019s legal nonprofit. The fall 1989 issue of 21st Century Science & Technology, for example, includes a brief item about a hotline that the Mountain States Legal Foundation set up for the public to report \u201cacts of environmental terrorism.\u201d Pendley, who served as the group\u2019s president for nearly three decades, was quoted warning about \u201ca small band of radical environmental terrorists\u201d who had vandalized ski resorts and allegedly driven metal spikes into trees. He was referring to the radical environmental group Earth First!, although he didn\u2019t mention it by name.\n\n\u201cWe need more facts to establish participants, patterns, and to determine the existence of a conspiracy on the part of those who would kill fathers in the name of Mother Earth,\u201d Pendley said in the magazine.\n\nScreenshot/21st Century Science & Technology A news brief that appeared in the fall 1989 issue of 21st Century Science & Technology.\n\nFreelance journalist Dennis King, who studied LaRouche and his followers for decades and published a book in 1989 titled \u201cLyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism,\u201d said it\u2019s significant that Pendley contributed to that magazine. While many in the wise-use movement shared LaRouche\u2019s views about environmental issues, very few publicly associated with the cult figure, he told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re writing for 21st Century Science & Technology, you\u2019re writing for people who really had some Nazi sympathies,\u201d King said. He noted that LaRouche and his followers had anti-Semitic beliefs and a long history of promoting and defending Nazi scientists. That included eulogizing Arthur Rudolph, the World War II German engineer who later helped develop the Saturn V rocket that put Americans on the moon.\n\nPendley\u2019s pieces appeared in the magazine at the time that LaRouche was serving a federal prison sentence in Minnesota for fraud and conspiracy. The eight-time presidential candidate and convicted felon died in February at age 96.\n\nA Sagebrush Rebel\n\nPendley\u2019s antipathy for environmentalists goes back decades. He cut his teeth in government under James Watt, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Interior Department chief and widely considered among the most anti-environment Cabinet appointees in U.S. history. Pendley and Watt have close ties. They both hail from Wyoming and led the Colorado-based Mountain States Legal Foundation. Watt was the group\u2019s first president and Pendley held the position from 1989 until last December. In 1981, Pendley followed Watt to the Interior Department and worked to open federal lands to drilling and mining. The Washington Post once described him as \u201cWatt\u2019s ideological twin.\u201d\n\nIn the 1996 book \u201cGreen Backlash,\u201d which documents the rise of the anti-environmental movement, British investigative journalist Andrew Rowell wrote that Pendley \u201chad been a close personal friend of James Watt\u2019s since 1975,\u201d six years before Watt appointed him to the Interior Department post.\n\nUnder Pendley\u2019s command, the Mountain States Legal Foundation, an industry-funded group once described as the \u201clitigating arm of the Wise Use Movement,\u201d hosted a series of wise-use conferences. At a 1993 event, Pendley compared environmentalists to communists, saying they are \u201clike watermelons, red on the inside, green on the outside,\u201d according to Rowell\u2019s book. And one day before a 1994 wise-use event in Joseph, Oregon, that featured Pendley as a speaker, demonstrators in that town hung, tarred and feathered effigies of two environmental activists.\n\nPendley has compared the Earth First! group to the Nazis, saying \u201cthey are no better than Hitler\u2019s Brownshirts,\u201d according to Rowell. And in a 2013 interview with the Federalist Society, Pendley asserted that \u201cthe environmental community is no longer concerned about human beings.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rhetoric that closely mirrors that of Watt and LaRouche.\n\nWatt likened environmentalists to the Nazis and described green activists as \u201ca left-wing cult which seeks to bring down the kind of government I believe in.\u201d In 1990, several years after he was forced to resign as Interior chief, he famously declared that \u201cif the troubles from environmentalists cannot be solved in the jury box or at the ballot box, perhaps the cartridge box should be used.\u201d\n\nLaRouche, through his media outlets, often railed against environmental \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201ceco-fascists,\u201d going as far as to compare the movement to Satanism. Earth First! was one of his organization\u2019s primary targets.\n\nIn his 1996 book, Rowell wrote: \u201cLyndon LaRouche was one of the first people to brand anyone involved in any progressive protest as a \u2018terrorist\u2019. Following his lead many sections of society are now labelling environmentalists as terrorists. William Perry Pendley calls greens terrorists. MSLF [Mountain States Legal Foundation] has held conferences on eco-terrorism, and has been instrumental in having Earth First! labelled as a terrorist organisation.\u201d\n\nSinking A Biodiversity Pact\n\nEarly in Reagan\u2019s first term, LaRouche and his followers gained direct access to several administration officials, and in March 1981 LaRouche landed an invitation to have breakfast with Interior Secretary Watt, as journalists King and Ronald Radosh reported for The New Republic in 1984.\n\nWhile that sit-down proved largely unsuccessful in terms of winning over Reagan Cabinet members, the LaRouchians spent the next two decades working to forge alliances with anti-environmental organizations and industry groups, King told HuffPost.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Pendley ever met LaRouche in person, either while working in the Reagan administration or at MSLF. But he did cross paths with two LaRouche associates at a \u201cWise Use Leadership Conference\u201d in Sparks, Nevada, in July 1994, according to documents collected by an organization affiliated with the Environmental Working Group and archived by Greenpeace.\n\nElyssa Rosen, a representative of the environmental group Sierra Club, apparently infiltrated the conference. Her notes detail a bizarre, disorganized and delusional gathering. Attendees sold T-shirts that read \u201cClinton-Free Zone\u201d and likened environmentalists to witches and druids. Speakers at the event included Pendley, who reportedly stressed the need to \u201cexpose the hidden costs of environmental policy,\u201d as well as a \u201cLaRouche groupie\u201d and forest scientist named Michael Coffman, Rosen wrote in her notes.\n\nAlso at the conference was Rogelio \u201cRoger\u201d Maduro, a close LaRouche associate and an editor at the magazine according to a memo in the archived collection. At the time, Maduro was leading the LaRouche organization\u2019s behind-the-scenes campaign to kill U.S. Senate support for the Convention on Biological Diversity, a nonbinding conservation treaty. Maduro urged the wise-use leaders gathered in Nevada to make defeating the biodiversity treaty a top priority and disclosed that he was working with the American Sheep Industry Association on a paper to garner opposition, as detailed in a lengthy 1997 report by the Environmental Working Group.\n\nCoffman, a conspiracy theorist, also reportedly called conference attendees to defeat the treaty. Later that year, Coffman published a piece in 21st Century Science & Technology titled \u201cThe Pagan Roots of Environmentalism.\u201d\n\nThe collaborative effort by LaRouche\u2019s network and wise-use organizations ultimately proved successful. The treaty never came to the Senate floor for a vote, and the United States to this day has not signed on to the agreement. Maduro took credit in a September 1994 issue of Executive Intelligence Review, writing that the report he created for the sheep association was an \u201cimportant factor\u201d in defeating the pact. He applauded several of the groups that were present at the July 1994 conference for mobilizing in a way that left \u201cU.S. Senate staffers flabbergasted, State Department officials screaming, and greenies weeping,\u201d but did not mention Mountain States Legal Foundation. Coffman also claims to have \u201cplayed a key role in stopping the ratification\u201d of the treaty.\n\nScreenshot/Executive Intelligence Review A piece by Rogelio Maduro in the Sept. 2, 1994, issue of Executive Intelligence Review.\n\nRon Arnold, who is widely considered the father of the wise-use movement, told with The Washington Post in 1995 that the movement was unaware it had joined forces with the LaRouche organization to fight the treaty. He claimed he didn\u2019t know Maduro would speak at the Nevada conference and that LaRouche followers were not welcome at future events.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for an interview with Pendley or to a list of emailed questions about his writings and the 1994 wise-use conference. The Interior Department, of which the BLM is part, also did not respond.\n\nThe Same Old Torch\n\nPendley has faced an onslaught of criticism since joining the Trump administration. Environmentalists and other critics fear his appointment signals a future sell-off of federal lands in the West, pointing to Pendley\u2019s long history of advocating for just that. Pendley has dismissed such concerns and refused to comment about his past statements, including describing basic climate science as \u201cjunk science\u201d and comparing immigrants to a \u201ccancer.\u201d All of it, he told a room full of reporters earlier this month in Colorado, is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to his current job leading a bureau that manages more than one-third of all federal land and 700 million subsurface mineral acres.\n\nBut the reality is that his opinions and experience taking on the federal government are what make him a perfect fit for the Trump administration, and no doubt a main reason he landed the high-ranking position.\n\nA return to the bad days in the 1990s when radical environmentalists sabotaged logging equipment and endangered the lives of working men and women in the Mountain West and Pacific Northwest. Shame on these domestic terrorists. https://t.co/uLSZ0GKXL4 \u2014 Wm Perry Pendley (@Sagebrush_Rebel) November 12, 2018\n\nNearly three decades after contributing to the LaRouche publication, Pendley and what\u2019s left of LaRouche\u2019s organization continue to pound similar drums.\n\nAlong with its stunt at Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s town hall, the LaRouche organization has taken aim at 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. In September, the Executive Intelligence Review published a conspiracy-laden \u201cspecial report\u201d titled \u201c\u2018CO\u2082 Reduction\u2019 Is a Mass Murder Policy: Designed by Wall Street and the City of London.\u201d The report\u2019s landing page features a close-up of Thunberg wearing a hooded jacket.\n\nUp until his appointment to Trump\u2019s BLM, Pendley was posting under the Twitter handle @Sagebrush_Rebel, a reference to the Sagebrush Rebellion movement of the 1970s and \u201980s that sought to remove lands from federal control. His tweets often lashed out at environmental activists like Thunberg, whom he likened to a cult leader.\n\nIn a phone interview, Rowell marveled at the number of environmental foes featured in his 1996 book \u201cGreen Backlash\u201d who went on to hold positions of power in the Trump administration, which has prioritized gutting environmental regulations, and to join the chorus that\u2019s taken to attacking and demonizing the next generation of environmental advocates.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more fundamentally pathetic \u2015 a bunch of old right-wingers going after Greta,\u201d Rowell said.\n\nIt is a cult today, it was a cult in the 1960s, that, in the words of James Bond's foe Goldfinger, \"expect[s] [us] to die.\" The cult of Greta Thunberg https://t.co/NYmV7Jw9yZ \u2014 Wm Perry Pendley (@Sagebrush_Rebel) April 27, 2019\n\nIf it matters to you, it matters to us.
