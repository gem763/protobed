Choose your fabrics wisely\n\nA successful summer wardrobe is one that is textile-savvy.\n\nWhile stiff leathers and suede suits may be your go-to workwear staples on a normal British summer\u2019s day, these fabrics are likely to be too heavy duty in 30-plus degree temperatures.\n\nOpt for lightweight materials wherever possible: linen, muslin and loose-fitting denims are all breathable options that will make for a sweat-free day at your desk. Choose lighter colours where possible to keep yourself sweat-free.\n\n2. Balance is key\n\nIn peak Love Island season, where hot pants and bralets reign supreme, it can be all too easy to be seduced into thinking that such flesh-baring attire is socially acceptable in any sun-soaked setting, desk side or otherwise.\n\nThe thought of wearing a thong bikini into work might not have crossed your mind, but several balmy weather staples, such as bardot tops and miniskirts, can be tricky to make appropriate for an office environment.\n\nObviously this is not an issue for offices who employ strict smart dress codes, for whom bearing calves and arms is as risque as policy allows, but for those in more casual environments, it can be a contentious issue.\n\nThe best way forward is to take a balanced approach to your skin-baring, eg wearing a long-sleeved linen shirt over a knee-grazing dress.\n\n3. Tailoring is key\n\nShorter hemlines need not be banished from your workwear wardrobe, but if you find yourself lost through a series of shorts, skirts and dresses that feel a tad on the flimsy side, opt for one of the endless smart, tailored options available on the high street. Reiss and Mango are reliable sources for this.\n\n4. If all else fails, keep it simple\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a classic, free-flowing midi dress, particularly if you\u2019re sporting a suntan.\n\nIf the straps are slender and the neckline is low, seek out some careful layering tactics to make it work for the office, such as wearing a white T-shirt underneath to offer more coverage.", "description": "From sarcasm and stiff upper lips, to a penchant for afternoon tea and fish and chips, Britain is known for many things \u2013\u00a0but warm weather is not one of them.
