She suffered injuries from which she died 10 day later.\n\nHer close friend pleaded guilty to causing her death by careless driving during an appearance at Newcastle Crown Court.\n\nAfter the case, the victim\u2019s family said: \u201cThe verdict gives us the closure we need and allows us to move on, which is what our mum and dad would want for us.\u201d\n\nThey thanked hospital staff and friends for their support following the tragedy on Sept 18 last year, and police for their \u2018tenacity and professionalism\u2019 in seeking justice.\n\nThe court heard Tulip\u2019s Skoda Roomster had pulled up outside her friend\u2019s home in Brunton Park, Newcastle, when tragedy struck.\n\nJudge Amanda Rippon said: \u201cThey both got out. Mrs Tulip believed she had selected park but unintentionally selected reverse gear and failed to apply the handbrake sufficiently.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle crept backwards and she re-entered the vehicle and unintentionally pressed the accelerator. This rear movement caused the vehicle to hit Mrs Nainby, it\u2019s suggested she was hit by the inside of the door and propelled backwards.\u201d\n\nThe passenger door was not closed properly as another passenger was going to get out of the back, and swung open, hitting Mrs Nainby, the court heard.\n\n\u201cMr Nainby says nothing I can do can help alleviate the pain and suffering they have gone through after this tragic incident,\u201d the judge added.\n\nBut the victim\u2019s family recognised Mrs Tulip \u2018as a lifelong friend of their mother and wife and she will no doubt feel the horror of what has happened in an acute way\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they acknowledge the guilt and horror she will feel,\u201d she added.\n\nTulip, of Seghill, Northumberland, will be sentenced on December 3.\n\nShe has now given up her licence but was given an interim driving ban before being released on unconditional bail.", "description": "Patricia Tulip accidentally left her automatic car in reverse and as she attempted to stop it she hit the accelerator instead of the brake by mistake and knocked over Joyce Nainby", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Image", "Newcastle Chronicle"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717016.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Patricia-Tulip.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
