The new watchdog won't have the power to issue fines.\n\nAlso, it looks as though ministers are preparing to avoid controversial national measures by giving local councils the job of cleaning up the air.\n\nOn waste, Mrs May's government signed up to the EU's \"circular economy\" directive, which would see producers pay 80% of the costs for disposing of the packaging that wraps their goods.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has told the EU that the UK will have separate \"ambitious\" standards after Brexit. Does that mean the UK will stick to, or exceed, the 80% target?\n\n'Throwaway society'\n\nOn plastics, ministers are preparing to introduce charges on single-use plastics, like the plastic bag tax.\n\nBut environmentalists complain that doesn't go far enough.\n\nLibby Peake, from Greener UK - a coalition of pressure groups - told the BBC: \"We have got to be smarter about this.\n\n\"People are already turning to glass and aluminium drinks containers, which have more impact on the climate.\n\n\"The government needs to take wider action to curb the throwaway society.\"\n\nOn wildlife, ministers will follow the advice of conservationists and create nature recovery networks across the country.\n\nIn the meantime, the government has been slipping away from its legally binding targets on the emissions that are over-heating the climate.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The government's climate advisers recently called for higher taxes for frequent flyers\n\nMinisters are still committed to aviation expansion, fracking, North Sea drilling, building roads that experts say will generate traffic, blocking onshore wind power, and cutting support for home insulation and solar.\n\nThe government will respond later to a rebuke from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) that they're not moving fast enough.\n\nThe government's bill makes it clear that the new environmental watchdog will have more power over ministers than the CCC.\n\nThe bill refers only to England, but many of its measures are designed to apply across the UK.\n\n'Green transformation'\n\nEnvironment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: \"Our natural environment is a vital shared resource and the need to act to secure it for generations to come is clear.\n\n\"Our landmark Environment Bill leads a green transformation that will help our country to thrive.\n\n\"Crucially, it also ensures that after Brexit, environmental ambition and accountability are placed more clearly than ever at the heart of government.\"\n\nJoan Edwards from the Wildlife Trusts broadly welcomed the bill's emphasis on nature recovery, but she raised a host of questions about the green watchdog.\n\nShe asked: \"Will it be funded with multi-year budgets? Will MPs be able to vet the chairperson of the body? What duty is there on ministers from all departments to set environmental targets? Will the watchdog be fully independent of government?\"\n\nTanya Steele, from the WWF, said: \"Public concern for the environment has never been higher as we face a nature and climate emergency.\n\n\"Legally binding targets to protect and restore nature at home are welcome, but around the world our forests are burning and wildlife is being wiped out.\"\n\nShe added that the bill did not address the role the UK is playing in driving the destruction of nature overseas.\n\n\"We must also reduce and reverse the UK's negative impact on nature abroad and remove deforestation from the supply chains of foods we eat and things we buy.\"\n\nCommenting on the bill, shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said: \"Boris Johnson is threatening our environment with reckless new trade agreements that would undercut Britain's environmental standards.\"\n\nShe called on the government to ensure \"the UK won't fall behind the EU on environmental standards\".\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @Rharrabin", "description": "Environmentalists welcome parts of the new law, but others say the government is going backwards.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5805/production/_109233522_plasticbottlegetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
