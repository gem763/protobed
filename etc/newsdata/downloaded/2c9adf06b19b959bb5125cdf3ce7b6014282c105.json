The fine is the largest the FTC has leveled against Google, although it is tiny compared with the $5 billion fine imposed against Facebook this year for privacy violations.\n\nThe federal government has increased scrutiny of big tech companies in the past two years \u2014 especially questioning how the tech giants collect and use personal information from their billions of customers. Many of the huge Silicon Valley companies are also under antitrust investigations aimed at determining whether the companies have unlawfully stifled competition.\n\nKids under 13 are protected by a 1998 federal law that requires parental consent before companies can collect and share their personal information.\n\nTech companies typically skirt that by banning kids under 13 entirely, though such bans are rarely enforced. In YouTube\u2019s lengthy terms of service, those who are under 13 are simply asked, \u201cplease do not use the Service.\u201d\n\nBut younger kids commonly watch videos on YouTube, and many popular YouTube channels feature cartoons or sing-a-longs made for children. According to the FTC, YouTube assigned ratings to its video channels and even had a \u201cY\u201d category directed at kids ages 7 or under. Yet from an advertising standpoint, YouTube targeted ads to those kids just as they would adults.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s complaint details Google\u2019s mixed messages about who the site is geared for and includes as evidence Google presentations made to toy companies Mattel and Hasbro where YouTube is described as the \u201cnew Saturday Morning Cartoons\u201d and the \u201c#1 website regularly visited by kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cYouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. Yet when it came to complying with the law, he said, \u201cthe company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids.\u201d\n\nAccording to the settlement, Google and YouTube will get \u201cverifiable\u201d consent from parents before they collect or use personal information from children. The company also agreed not to use personal information they collected from children before.\n\nYouTube has its own service for children, YouTube Kids. The kids-focused service already requires parental consent and uses simple math problems to ensure that kids aren\u2019t signing in on their own.\n\nYouTube Kids does not target ads based on viewer interests the way the main YouTube service does. But the children\u2019s version does track information about what kids are watching in order to recommend videos. It also collects personally identifying device information.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google said that starting early next year, it will also limit targeting on its main service for videos meant for kids. Google is relying on video creators to label such items, though it will also employ artificial intelligence to help.\n\nYouTube won\u2019t seek parental consent there, however, even on videos intended for children. The company is avoiding that precaution by instead turning off any personal tracking on those videos, saying it will collect only what is needed to make the service work. For such videos, YouTube also won\u2019t offer features like comments and notifications and won\u2019t serve personalized ads.\n\nThe settlement now needs to be approved by a federal court in Washington.\n\nAs with the Facebook settlement, the FTC vote was 3-2, with both Democrats opposing.\n\nYouTube \u201cbaited kids with nursery rhymes, cartoons, and more to feed its massively profitable behavioral advertising business,\u201d Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a tweet. \u201cIt was lucrative, and it was illegal.\u201d\n\nHe said in his dissent that the settlement offered no individual accountability, insufficient remedies and a fine amount that \u201cstill allows the company to profit from its lawbreaking.\u201d\n\nSen. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the settlement terms won\u2019t turn YouTube into a safe place for children and \u201cmakes clear that this FTC stands for \u2018Forgetting Teens and Children.\u2019\u201d\n\nA coalition of advocacy groups that last year helped trigger the FTC\u2019s investigation said the outcome will reduce the amount of behavioral advertising targeting children.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified that the FTC has finally forced Google to confront its longstanding lie that it wasn\u2019t targeting children on YouTube,\u201d said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.\n\nBut he said the \u201cpaltry\u201d fine sends a signal that politically powerful corporations don\u2019t have to fear serious consequences for breaking the law.\n\nGoogle is already under a 2011 agreement with the FTC that barred it from mispresenting its privacy policy and subjected the company to 20 years of regular, independent privacy audits. Google was fined $22.5 million in 2012 for violating that settlement when the FTC found it improperly used tracking cookies on Apple\u2019s Safari browser.\n\nSeparately, the FTC fined video site Musical.ly, now called TikTok, $5.7 million earlier this year after finding it illegally collected personal information about kids.\n\n___\n\nLerman reported from San Francisco.
