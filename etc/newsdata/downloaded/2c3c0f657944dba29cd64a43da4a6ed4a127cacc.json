Starring: Dev Patel, Armie Hammer, Nazanin Boniadi, Anupam Kher, Tilda Cobham-Hervey, and Jason Isaacs. 15 cert, 123 mins\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to talk about Hotel Mumbai without asking the thorniest of questions: whose stories do we have a right to tell? The directorial debut of Australia\u2019s Anthony Maras, the film revisits the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which killed 166 people and lasted four days. It doesn\u2019t come off as exploitation, but neither is it entirely free from the limits of its creators\u2019 perspective, his distance from the narrative running the risk of warping its reality.\n\nHotel Mumbai is thoughtful and considered in its approach \u2013 more so, at least, than we usually expect from glossy adaptations of international tragedy. Maras and John Collee\u2019s screenplay is careful not to wade into white saviour territory; it\u2019s the courageous efforts of Dev Patel\u2019s Arjun that are consistently placed front and centre. He\u2019s a fictional amalgamation (as are the majority of the characters) of the countless staff members of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel who risked \u2013 and, in many cases, sacrificed \u2013 their lives in order to protect guests, after the building became one of the 12 locations targeted by the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group. A lesser film would have pitched Armie Hammer\u2019s David, a wealthy architect, as its all-American hero, but his primary function here is as the loyal husband to to Nazanin Boniadi\u2019s Zahra, the one Muslim character depicted among the victims.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Stanley Kubrick's 10 best films \u2013 ranked Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Stanley Kubrick's 10 best films \u2013 ranked 1/10 10. The Killing (1956) Filmed when Kubrick was just 27 years old, The Killing is a clever and visually deft heist noir starring Sterling Hayden. Because of union regulations, Kubrick had to hire a separate cinematographer for the film, and the Oscar-winning Lucien Ballard was chosen. The pair clashed on set. Yet, even this early in his career, Kubrick proved tough and refused to compromise on the lenses being used or shot selection. The Killing never quite hits the heights of Kubrick\u2019s later films, but it was major influence on many modern heist movies, including Reservoir Dogs, and its memorable racetrack set-piece was echoed in 2017\u2019s Logan Lucky. United Artists 2/10 9. Lolita (1962) The film which birthed Kubrick\u2019s enduring reputation for controversy, Lolita \u2013 an adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s scandalous novel written from the perspective of a child sexual predator \u2013 proved a tricky sell for distributors. Lolita is often seen as Kubrick's first mature feature, and its uncomfortable premise has lost none of its edge when viewed today. James Mason is wonderfully creepy as Humbert Humbert, the academic who lusts after the teenaged Dolores Haze (Sue Lyon), but it is Peter Sellars who steals the show here, in a brilliant multi-faceted comic performance which anticipated his roles in Dr Strangelove. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 3/10 8. Paths of Glory (1957) While Kubrick\u2019s first run at an anti-war feature would later be overshadowed by Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory is still an extremely effective portrayal of bureaucracy and injustice in the First World War. Kubrick began to refine his distinctive visual style while filming, having the camera follow Kirk Douglas\u2019s Colonel Dax around the trenches. His use of the battlefield tracking shot positions it as a distant ancestor to Saving Private Ryan. United Artists 4/10 7. A Clockwork Orange (1971) Adapted from Anthony Burgess\u2019s supposedly unadaptable novel, A Clockwork Orange was made by Kubrick at the height of his powers. Its many great qualities \u2013 innovative use of classical music, idiosyncratic production design and moral complexity \u2013 were ultimately eclipsed by its horrifying sexual violence. The film was initially a financial success \u2013 until reports of copycat violence were published by the media, leading to the director pulling the film from British cinemas partway through its run. Warner Bros 5/10 6. Barry Lyndon (1975) Barry Lyndon is a superlative feat of filmmaking craft and is considered by many Kubrick purists to be the director\u2019s finest feature. Charting the rise and fall of an Irish social climber and fortunate duellist (Ryan O\u2019Neal), Kubrick\u2019s foray into the world of period dramas was not a convincing commercial success, and its nearly three-hour runtime can be off-putting for casual viewers. Barry Lyndon does, however, look spectacular. Kubrick developed specialised camera technology to film by candlelight, and many of the shots were composed to look like classical paintings. Warner Bros 6/10 5. Full Metal Jacket (1987) Kubrick\u2019s shocking take on the Vietnam war arrived in the wake of several other classic Vietnam movies (Apocalypse Now; Platoon; The Deer Hunter) but found its own place in the public imagination thanks to its unusual diptych structure. Most of the film\u2019s famous imagery comes from the first half, set in an American training camp. Full Metal Jacket\u2019s second half, a descent into the hell of the Vietnamese warzone, is slick and appropriately harrowing but never quite fulfils the promise of the beginning. Kubrick showed his usual flair for casting when he chose former marine R Lee Ermey to play an abusive drill sergeant. Warner Bros 7/10 4. Eyes Wide Shut (1999) Eyes Wide Shut, a sexual odyssey starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, was Kubrick\u2019s final film. Set against a dream-like Christmas backdrop, Eyes Wide Shut steers Cruise\u2019s upper-crust doctor through a hazy mess of conspiracies and perversions, leading to a masked orgy in a private mansion; the most resounding and talked-about sequence in the film. Eyes Wide Shut had an incredible 14-month shoot. Kubrick managed to complete the editing and witnessed the first (enthusiastic) responses to the film shortly before his death. Despite the prurience of its premise, Eyes Wide Shut ranks among the director\u2019s best for its thematic nuance and dense, unsettling ambience. Warner Bros 8/10 3. Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) After originally optioning Cold War novel Red Alert for adaptation as a political drama, Kubrick found the subject matter perversely suited for black comedy. Peter Sellars gives three stellar performances (as US president Merkin Muffley, toadying officer Group Captain Mandrake, and the deranged ex-Nazi scientist Dr Strangelove) and Strangelove\u2019s stream of quotable lines helps make it one of the most iconic satires of all time. Some of the behind-the-scenes stories have become notorious in their own right \u2013 such as Kubrick insisting on a bright green casino-style table-top for the film, which is shot entirely in black-and-white. Columbia Pictures 9/10 2. The Shining (1980) The Shining was met with mixed reviews and scorn from Stephen King (on whose novel it is based) when it was released, but in the years since, Kubrick\u2019s adaptation has been recognised as a classic of the horror genre. The director was famously cruel in his treatment of Shelley Duvall (who played the terrified wife of Jack Nicholson\u2019s homicidal patriarch), with one scene requiring a staggering 127 takes. In Kubrick\u2019s mind, the treatment was simply a means to an end; he once told Duvall that \u201cnothing great was ever accomplished without suffering\u201d. The Shining is a labyrinth of suffering, on-screen and off, but its greatness is plain to see. Warner Bros 10/10 1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) None of the Kubrick's other films can quite match the the influence, ambition or visionary inspiration of his 1968 sci-fi opus. A transcendent epic that charts the evolution of humanity from prehistoric apes through to our unknowable interstellar future, 2001: A Space Odyssey redrew the limits of what science fiction could achieve. Co-writing the script with sci-fi legend Arthur C Clarke, the director employed revolutionary practical effects to depict the future of space travel, balletically juxtaposing images of moving spacecrafts with classical music. Kubrick\u2019s reputation as a cold, mechanical director stems in large part from this film, but 2001 understands that humanity and technology are two sides of the same evolutional coin.

Kubrick\u2019s reputation as a cold, mechanical director stems in large part from this film, but 2001 understands that humanity and technology are two sides of the same evolutional coin. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nThe film layers real news footage on top of unflinching depictions of bloodshed and chaos. You can feel the walls closing in on the survivors as they realise their paths of escape are being cut off, one by one, with each passing moment. It\u2019s the kind of film you experience in the pit of your stomach. Maras studied hours of interview footage captured for the 2009 documentary Surviving Mumbai, never wanting to lose sight of the real experiences his film draws from. He also avoids reductive representations of Islamic terrorism as a blankly evil threat. The perpetrators are shown for who they were: angry, impoverished young men who allowed themselves to be corrupted and moulded into weapons of war.\n\nBut despite all his efforts, he\u2019s still someone on the outside looking in, weaving together strands of truth to create something appealing and absorbing to western audiences. Scenes of intimate, unguarded humanity are punctured by moments that have the mood and pacing of an action thriller. An attempt to breach the topic of racism in western reactions to terrorism comes off as patronising. There\u2019s even a relatively awkward attempt at humour, as we watch the terrorists joke around or Jason Isaacs\u2019 shady Russian go into full tough-guy mode.\n\nMore subtly, the film ends up falling prey to the damaging narrative that Islamic terrorism is primarily an attack on the West, despite the fact the majority of its victims are Muslim \u2013 it\u2019s the rich, white patrons who are presented as the ultimate targets, anyone else is collateral. As noble as Hotel Mumbai\u2019s intentions may be, perhaps there were simply too many pitfalls here. It\u2019s inevitable that it would fall short.\n\nHotel Mumbai is released in UK cinemas and on Sky Cinema on 27 September", "description": "Dir: Anthony Maras.
