Leitch and his head coach, Jamie Joseph, revealed their players had spoken before the game about how they could help to ease the pain of those affected and said it provided extra motivation before their 28-21 win against Scotland.\n\nAfter the Brave Blossoms had secured their place in the quarter-finals for the first time in the tournament\u2019s history, Leitch confirmed the deadly weekend typhoon had helped unite his team before the biggest game of their lives so far.\n\n\u201cBefore the match at the team hotel the players already knew this game was about more than just us, that a lot of people suffered in the typhoon for this game to happen,\u201d said Leitch, whose side will now face South Africa next Sunday.\n\nJapan show world their defiance and skill in face of typhoon destruction | Andy Bull Read more\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the opportunity to inspire Japan and we showed that for 80 minutes. It\u2019s great for Japanese rugby and rugby in Asia. For us to qualify for the quarter-finals is shifting the goalposts. We\u2019re not coming out next week to have a good game and lose. We\u2019re coming out to win.\u201d\n\nJoseph also suggested the team had wanted to deliver a result as a tribute to the victims of the worst storm to hit Japan in decades. \u201cI think it is important to acknowledge what went on with regards to the typhoon,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cWhen we woke up this morning nine people had been killed and 12 are still missing. We talked about that as a team. Sometimes those sorts of things can be overwhelming, but I think it came out in the mix today. A lot of people are suffering.\u201d\n\nScotland, meanwhile, have acknowledged they could have few excuses after failing to make the knockout stages at a World Cup for only the second time. The full-back Stuart Hogg said: \u201cI truly believed we could come here and get a victory but if I am brutally honest we got beaten by the better side.\n\n\u201cFair play to Japan, they took the opportunities on offer and if you give a team like Japan 28 points in a Test match you are going to have to do something exceptional to be on the winning side. It is going to hurt because we came here believing we could achieve something special. Instead we haven\u2019t managed to get out of the group stages and it\u2019s tough for us. We are bitterly disappointed, we can\u2019t change anything and we are going home.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s head coach, Gregor Townsend, also admitted his side had fallen short but suggested Japan could yet cause problems for the Springboks. \u201cIt was always going to be a challenge given the way Japan were playing and our short turnaround,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we had the team and the ability to go on and win by the necessary number of points. That we didn\u2019t is a huge disappointment. They have some really good players with pace and confidence. They\u2019re a good side and they cause you problems in a number of areas. It\u2019ll be tough for South Africa. That\u2019ll be a very close game.\u201d", "description": "Japan\u2019s captain, Michael Leitch, believes the host nation can still achieve more at the Rugby World Cup and provide some comfort for the victims of Typhoon Hagibis", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90074dcc22dc71c9042f3f9bc9b17c354d531408/410_463_3286_1971/master/3286.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eaac8097dc2a4b77881a65af688fd087", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
