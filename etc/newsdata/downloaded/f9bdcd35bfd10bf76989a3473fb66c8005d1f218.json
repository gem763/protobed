Bernie Sanders speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has earned endorsements from Israel-boycotters Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., NY), and Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich), said during the annual J Street national conference on Monday that the U.S. should \u201cleverage\u201d military aid to Israel in order \u201cto demand respect for human rights and democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy solution is to say to Israel: you get $3.8 billion dollars every year, if you want military aid you\u2019re going to have to fundamentally change your relationship to the people of Gaza,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn fact, I think it is fair to say that some of that should go right now into humanitarian aid in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe US has agreed to give Israel a massive military aid package called the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The latest aid package was approved by the Obama administration and commits to giving Israel $38 billion in military aid to Israel over 10 years. The MOU covers the years 2019-2028.\n\n\"My solution is to say to Israel: you get $3.8 bil every year, if you want military aid you're going to have to fundamentally change your relationship to the people of Gaza, in fact I think it is fair to say that some of that should go right now into humanitarian aid\" #JSt2019 pic.twitter.com/z5WmEEjbxI \u2014 People for Bernie (@People4Bernie) October 28, 2019\n\nSanders denounced the situation in Gaza as \u201cabsolutely inhumane,\u201d \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and \u201cunsustainable.\u201d He also criticized President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying \u201cone is going to be impeached, the other one may end up in jail, so I don\u2019t know how much credibility they have, actually in terms of integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Palestinian people have a right to live in peace and security as well. It is not anti-Semitism to say that Netanyahu\u2019s government has been racist,\u201d Sanders continued.\n\nThe Gaza strip is run by the terrorist organization Hamas, which in May launched nearly 300 rockets into Israel. In July, Hamas official Fathi Hamad told Palestinians that \u201cthere are Jews everywhere! We must attack every Jew on planet Earth \u2014 we must slaughter and kill them, with Allah\u2019s help. Enough warming up!\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 remarks drew criticism from prominent conservatives, including former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who last year defended Israeli \u201crestraint\u201d in clashes with Palestinian protestors.\n\nJust when you thought Bernie Sanders couldn\u2019t get any more radical, he outdid himself. He wants to take money we give to Israel to defend itself from terrorists, and give it to Gaza, which is run by terrorists?? Unreal. Why isn\u2019t every other Dem pres candidate saying he\u2019s wrong? \u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) October 29, 2019", "description": "Sanders said that the U.S. should \u201cleverage\u201d military aid to Israel in order \u201cto demand respect for human rights and democracy.\u201d", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
