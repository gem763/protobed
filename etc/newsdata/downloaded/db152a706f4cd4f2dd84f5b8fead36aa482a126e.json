Referendums will play a central role in the president\u2019s efforts to raise the legitimacy of his government and its policies, according to Dmytro Razumkov, the speaker of Ukraine\u2019s parliament and a former leader of Servant of the People.\n\nThat\u2019s a steep hill to climb. According to a Gallup poll conducted in March, just ahead of the presidential election, only 9 percent of Ukrainians trusted their government \u2014 the lowest ranking in the world.\n\n\u201cReferendums can play a positive role,\u201d Razumkov said in an interview.\n\nA public say\n\nRazumkov has been outspoken about wanting to hold referendums on so-called decommunization \u2014 the mass renaming of Soviet-inspired town and city names that was carried out under Petro Poroshenko\u2019s government. \u201cI think it\u2019s right that the people who live in a certain town or city should have the final say over its name,\u201d he said.\n\nRazumkov also suggested referendums on foreign policy, in particular membership of international organizations, would be fair game.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s predecessor Poroshenko had proposed national referendums on Ukraine\u2019s eventual EU and NATO membership. These were never held, and the country\u2019s commitment to Euro-Atlantic Integration was added to the constitution after a parliamentary vote in February 2019.\n\nThe legitimacy of this type of amendment would be greater if the issue was put to the public first, said Razumkov. \u201cIt would be much harder [for the next government to change those amendments] after the public has made clear its views in a referendum on the issue,\u201d he added.\n\nZelenskiy, who has said he\u2019s committed to Ukraine\u2019s pro-European course, has already suggested holding referendums on NATO and EU membership in order to build consensus on the issue. The referendums would be consultative, not legally binding, he clarified in May. The goal, he said, is \u201copenness in discussing important issues, and not to make decisions behind closed doors, as it was done before.\u201d\n\nThe issue could become even more pressing if Zelenskiy chooses to push for a new constitution entirely, rather than continuing his current course of proposing multiple constitutional amendments. In that case, some observers say, he could seek to get it approved in a popular referendum.\n\nOther issues could prove more controversial. Zelenskiy has made ending the war in the country\u2019s east one of his key priorities. In May, the head of his presidential administration, Andriy Bohdan, said that if a final peace deal with Moscow looked like it would be divisive among voters, it could be put to a national referendum.\n\nSvyatoslav Vakarchuk, a popular singer and leader of the Golos party, the fourth largest in Ukraine\u2019s new parliament, called holding a referendum a \u201cdangerous and irresponsible\u201d idea at a time when \u201cnot just a hot war, but also an information war, are being waged against us.\u201d\n\nA \u201creal leader\u201d holds referendums when he wants the public\u2019s feedback on a concrete proposal, he said in a separate statement. Referendums, he added, shouldn\u2019t be used to shift the burden of responsibility.\n\nPotential for abuse\n\nUkrainians are, perhaps unsurprisingly, somewhat wary of referendums \u2014 and their potential for abuse.\n\nThe country\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union was achieved in part thanks to a referendum in December 1991, Razumkov stressed in the interview. But other attempts to put thorny issues to the people were less successful.\n\nIn April 2000, then President Leonid Kuchma held a constitutional referendum on granting the presidency extensive new powers and establishing an upper house for Ukraine\u2019s parliament. The proposed changes were never implemented due to challenges by the Supreme Court and disputes over whether ratification by parliament was also required to do so.\n\nMore recently, referendums in Ukraine have come to be associated with Russian aggression: In March 2014, pro-Moscow forces in control of Crimea carried out a disputed referendum on the territory\u2019s status, the results of which were later used by the Kremlin to justify Russia\u2019s annexation of the peninsula. In May of the same year, the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, two Russian-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, held referendums on their \u201cstate sovereignty.\u201d These areas remain outside the Ukrainian government\u2019s control.\n\n\u201c[Referendums] allow you to not take decisions yourself, letting \u2018the people\u2019 decide for you So if things go wrong, they also bear some responsibility\" \u2014 Volodymyr Fesenko, political scientist\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s plan to call more referendums is also likely to run into legal hurdles. The country\u2019s constitution obliges the president or parliament to call a referendum on any issue except for taxation, budgets, or the amnesty of criminals, if there is proof of support from at least 3 million Ukrainian voters in at least two-thirds of the country\u2019s provinces.\n\nBut there is no law on how these referendums should be conducted \u2014 and how the results should be implemented \u2014 meaning they can quickly become legal and political quagmires, as several of Zelenskiy\u2019s predecessors discovered.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s critics dismiss his fondness for direct democracy as a lack of political vision and an attempt to shrug off accountability.\n\n\u201c[Referendums] allow you to not take decisions yourself, letting \u2018the people\u2019 decide for you,\u201d said Volodymyr Fesenko, a political scientist and director of the Kyiv-based Penta Centre for Political Studies. \u201cSo if things go wrong, they also bear some responsibility.\u201d\n\nFirst test\n\nA test to Zelenskiy\u2019s commitment to \u201cpeople power\u201d will come later this year. In July, his office announced it would cancel Ukraine\u2019s moratorium on selling agricultural land to foreign investors by 2020. Removing this obstacle, which was introduced in 2001, has been a long-standing demand of the International Monetary Fund, and one Zelenskiy must meet to secure badly needed tranches of financial support in future.\n\nIn this case, Zelenskiy\u2019s stated commitment to putting important decisions to the people could put him in a difficult position.\n\n\u201cMost probably, everybody will be against the marketization [of land], so it\u2019s a dangerous game he\u2019s playing,\u201d Mikhail Minakov, an expert on Ukrainian politics and senior adviser at the Wilson Center.\n\nOpposition politicians are already mobilizing to demand a referendum on the issue. Viktor Medvedchuk, the leader of the pro-Russian Opposition Bloc-For Life, claimed in August that the government has \u201cno moral right\u201d to change the law without a popular vote. Former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko, who leads the opposition Fatherland party, also voiced opposition to the move.\n\nAll this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cpower to the people\u201d is a bad idea in itself, said Minakov. Referendums could have a \u201ctherapeutic effect\u201d on Ukraine, he said.\n\n\u201cPoroshenko created this \u2018small Ukraine,\u2019 [which worked] for a quarter of the electorate, while the rest of society was deprived of a voice and their interests were disregarded,\u201d said Minakov. The political scientist predicted that Zelenskiy would most likely hold referendums on issues of national identity and memory, which are \u201chighly symbolic, but of little practical significance.\u201d\n\nReferendums could give them the sense the government is listening and give them \u201chope for something better.\u201d\n\nMaxim Edwards is a freelance journalist based in Eastern Europe.", "description": "Country\u2019s comedian-turned-president pledge to rule by referendum faces its first challenge.", "authors": ["Maxim Edwards", "David M.
