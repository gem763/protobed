Because of that, employers or landlords will not be asked to carry out checks until everyone who is eligible for the EU settlement scheme has had a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to get that sorted.\n\nBeyond December 2020, employers and others will need to check the status of people from the EU but they will not be requested to do this retrospectively.\n\nSteven Peers, professor of EU law at the University of Essex, said the government is effectively proposing \u201ca unilateral transition\u201d of one year to avoid being sued, after ministers were warned by lawyers that an immediate rule change risked legal action.\n\n\u201cIt should avoid any serious crisis of large numbers of EU citizens not being able to enter the country again [after a no-deal Brexit],\u201d Peers said. \u201cIt seems to be a climbdown because the government had threatened a much stricter scheme, without really explaining it.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office insisted that a \u201ccrucial difference\u201d between the current and the new immigration system would be that those who do not hold valid immigration permission to be in the U.K. \u201cmay be liable to enforcement action.\u201d EU nationals who commit crimes during their stay in Britain would be subject to tougher treatment, and could be deported, the department said.\n\nThe plans would apply to people from European Economic Area countries and Switzerland. Irish nationals will continue to be able to settle in the U.K. long-term under a Common Travel Area arrangement.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Home Office published a letter asking the independent Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review of the Australian immigration system to come up with recommendations on how to adapt it to the U.K. after Brexit.", "description": "Home Office admits Britain\u2019s new immigration system will not be in place until at least 2021.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Annabelle Dickson", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-487314891-1200x628.jpg"}
