Real Madrid\u2019s fans once famously held up a mock classified advert requesting a \u201cworthy rival for a decent derby\u201d, and they got it: Real arrived at the home of their city rivals having won just two of the last 15 meetings between these two teams and they didn\u2019t win this one either.\n\nThat they departed reasonably satisfied with another draw \u2013 Real have still only lost once in their last eighteen visits to the Vicente Calder\u00f3n and the Wanda Metropolitano \u2013 reflects how much things have changed, how distant those days seem now. It also reflects the fact that with this result, they remain top of the league.\n\nBetween them, these sides spent almost \u20ac600m in the summer, but they produced a game of few chances, in which both managers looked for a way through but appeared more concerned with the other man not finding it.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid 0-0 Real Madrid: La Liga \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nThe last time the teams met, it finished 7-2 to Atl\u00e9tico in New Jersey. \u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d Zidane had said; what would happen now would be different, everyone knew. This was tighter, tenser, and meant more; it was always likely to be, as was reflected in the inclusion of Federico Valverde in Real\u2019s midfield in place of James Rodr\u00edguez. Within five minutes, Sergio Ramos left Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix on the floor \u2013 and gestured for him to get up again. This was a battle for control which no one really won.\n\nIf there was a broad first-half pattern it ran: Atl\u00e9tico, Real, Atl\u00e9tico. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix shot wide when Diego Costa sent him running clear. Hazard escaped up the left, but his cross was cut out. And fairly harmless shots from Karim Benzema, Nacho and Toni Kroos drew three corners in little over a minute. Kroos then took the ball beautifully on the bounce, sweeping a bending, side-footer from 20 yards that Jan Oblak dived to push away.\n\nIn the middle of it all, Thomas Partey was the game\u2019s outstanding midfielder and he sent a superb cross through the six-yard box which Costa couldn\u2019t quite reach. He also retook control and, as Atl\u00e9tico advanced again, it was Kieran Trippier they most often sought. A wonderful pass from Thomas found him in the area, free. Options didn\u2019t quite open before him, at least not with the speed he hoped, and Courtois reached out to stop his low ball seeking out Koke at the far post.\n\nThomas it had been too who teed up Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix to hit a shot just wide from the edge of the area. Opportunities were limited, though, and Diego Simeone made his first change at the break, \u00c1ngel Correa replacing Vitolo and immediately dashing in to head over Costa\u2019s chipped pass.\n\nCorrea brought electricity but it was Real who had the first clear chance when Eden Hazard found Nacho overlapping. Nacho\u2019s cutback ran towards Gareth Bale, thundering into the area and the perfect shooting position. He opened up his body and hit the ball bending high into the south end, the roar from the fans there speaking of relief.\n\nAt the other end, Trippier\u2019s cross \u2013 his ninth of the game \u2013 only just evaded Costa. Both sides looked for solutions, albeit without running excessive risks, and the changes came: Thomas Lemar, Luka Modric, Marcos Llorente, Rodr\u00edguez. In Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s case, the changes were especially significant: Koke changed sides, Sa\u00fal went to left back, and Correa moved from right to centre. And yet the game didn\u2019t move much, even though Modric immediately sent a ball across the face of goal. Sa\u00fal headed Koke\u2019s corner just past the post.\n\nThen Nacho\u2019s inswinging cross was met by Benzema, but Oblak dived full length to make a sharp save low by the post. Lemar, Correa and Trippier combined to reach the byline but Koke couldn\u2019t turn the shot goalwards at the near post. At the south end, they sang. On the pitch, they couldn\u2019t score.", "description": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Thomas Partey weaved magic in midfield while Gareth Bale missed Real Madrid\u2019s best chance in a tense 0-0 draw", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/536b13b013525185d9eab56f3564f3e81890980f/0_258_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f30fd3b245b0e49cff335400d0720f6", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
