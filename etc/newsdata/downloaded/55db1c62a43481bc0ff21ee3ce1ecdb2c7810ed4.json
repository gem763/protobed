REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/Pool\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - The Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities have not helped diplomatic efforts to organise talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, French President Emmanuel Macron told Le Monde newspaper.\n\nFrance is trying to salvage Iran\u2019s nuclear deal as Tehran scales back its commitments in response to a U.S. pullout from the accord. Paris has urged de-escalation in the Gulf.\n\nSpeaking to the paper while flying to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Macron said caution was needed in apportioning blame for the attack, which shook global oil markets.\n\n\u201cOne must be very careful in attributing responsibility. There are clusters of clues, but this bombardment is a new military event that changes the region\u2019s ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cthe chances of talks between Trump and Rouhani \u201chad certainly not increased\u201d since the strike.\n\nTrump, who ordered more sanctions and approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi defences, initially declared Washington was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to respond to the attack, then said there were options short of war.\n\nThe French president described Trump as a lone and impulsive decision-maker, whereas Rouhani, he said, had to bring an entire political system on board.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians are flexible on the terms but inflexible on the timing which, in their eyes, should come only at the end of the process, while the U.S. objective is to have this meeting in the near-term,\u201d Macron told Le Monde.\n\nBritain on Monday joined the United States and Saudi Arabia in pointing the finger at Iran for the Saudi attack.", "description": "The Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities have not helped diplomatic efforts to organise talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, French President Emmanuel Macron told Le Monde newspaper.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432924790&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0MT", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
