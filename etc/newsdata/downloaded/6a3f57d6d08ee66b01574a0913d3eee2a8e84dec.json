That\u2019s a bit on the nose, given the Whisperers\u2019 penchant for wearing the dead-flesh variety. But they\u2019re not the only ones in costumes of sorts: Michonne and Zeke have a heart-to-heart about the weight of their emotional disguises, and Lydia suggests the do-gooders at A-Town are less than authentic. More important than the strained mask metaphors, though, is a familiar theme \u2014 any attempts to coexist with violent lunatics are doomed to fail.\n\nSpeaking of the obvious, the episode begins with the song \u201cHeaven I Know\u201d by Gordi, an aching, melancholy ballad about two friends who drift apart. Cue the montage of people drifting apart. When Daryl tries to bring Carol some food, she won\u2019t open her bedroom door. A sweaty Siddiq sees Rosita with Gabe; Lydia sees Siddiq see Rosita with Gabe; Siddiq runs away and Lydia looks super teen-angsty. Magna and Yumiko get busy, but afterward, Magna seems distant, for reasons we\u2019ll learn later.\n\nThen there\u2019s Zeke, who is so emotionally frozen that when a huge tree crushes the Hilltop fence and a barn full of people, he barely reacts. Even ol\u2019 Earl knows damn well this isn\u2019t an accident \u2014 it\u2019s a message from the Whisperers. The tree collapse divides the survivors into two factions: The hawks who are ready to take down Alpha and her army, and the doves who think taking on the Whisperers and their horde as a suicide mission. Judith asks her mom if they could live alongside \u201cthe Skins,\u201d as she calls them. \u201cNever take your enemy at their word,\u201d Michonne says. \u201cMeasure them by their actions.\u201d Master tactician that she is, Judith surmises that the Whisperers are treating them like Michonne handles little RJ when he won\u2019t sleep \u2014 make them run around until they don\u2019t have any energy left to put up a fight. Seems like the kid is right.\n\nSo while Hilltop scrambles to repair the fence, some folks at A-Town are low-key preparing for war. The tension lands squarely on Lydia, thanks to that douchnozzle Gage, who\u2019s picked on her from day one, and Margo, the enraged Highwaywoman who lashed out at the town meeting. Lydia\u2019s response to their bullying: Spraying them with the blood of a dead varmint at the lunch table and doing the Whisperer \u201cshhhh.\u201d Teens will be teens, I suppose, but even for one raised in the wilderness by a psychopath, that was a colossally stupid move.\n\nYou know you\u2019re in trouble when Negan is your mentor, but it makes sense that Lydia is drawn to him \u2014 he\u2019s both a strong father figure she never had and an outcast. Daryl fits that description, too. Ironically, while Negan preaches \u201ckill them with kindness,\u201d it\u2019s Daryl\u2019s fighting spirit that Lydia idolizes; it\u2019s also what gets her in trouble. You knew someone was going to save her from the wicked beating Gage and Margo dished out, but a) I thought Daryl would come to the rescue and b) I did not think that Negan flung Margo into the wall so hard that he killed her.\n\nThat\u2019s when the cracks in A-Town turn into chasms, as the townsfolk are split on yet another important issue: whether Negan deserves to die for (yet another) murder. Daryl visits him in lockup and as usual, Neegs reads his mind and knows he\u2019s conflicted about what to do. Negan also says it\u2019s messed up that just as he was starting to fall in line with A-Town\u2019s way of life, he\u2019s now on the chopping block for doing the right thing.\n\nKudos to Carol, who wisely assesses that all this Negan drama is simply a distraction from a much bigger existential problem. Not only are they living with the threat that an unstable murder-mom might send tens of thousands of zombies their way at any time, they\u2019re all still coping with the aftermath of those beheadings. Saddiq can barely keep his shit together without getting feverish and screaming into a bowl of ice water\u2014give yourself a script for Xanax and find a moisture-wicking tee, bro.\n\nThen there\u2019s Zeke, who is so depressed that he nearly hurls himself into a ravine. Luckily, Michonne arrives in time to vanquish his suicidal thoughts with a hug, and they bond over losing a partner and struggling to wear a \u201cmask\u201d of strength. (Out here, most ride-or-die relationships end in the latter.) Zeke also kisses her in a moment of weakness, and while Michonne doesn\u2019t exactly resist, she does look disturbed. I\u2019m feeling confident that a Michonne-Zeke-Carol love triangle will thankfully not happen.\n\nOn a more entertaining note, there\u2019s a sweet cinematic standoff outside the gates of Hilltop in the moonlight \u2014 a cool panning shot of the scene as Magna\u2019s trio and the sisters arrow, slingshot, and hack the undead back to death. The scene-stealer is Judith, as usual, who comes flying in with a sword and takes out two walkers with a few very deliberate strokes. Mom can\u2019t help but smile, and really, isn\u2019t this what family is all about? Michonne and J-Murder kill a few more zombies, then back up into a synchronized battle position, and in this moment I realized I\u2019d be happy watching these two slay for a full hour. Magna eventually reveals why she was sulked like a baby after Yumiko took charge during the zombie siege: Miko was apparently her lawyer before the world fell apart, and Magna apparently doesn\u2019t like feeling powerless, especially with someone who once charged her by the hour.\n\nTwo critical scenes set the stage for next week and beyond. Over ham radio or some such thing, Michonne tells Daryl that they need Lydia alive \u2014 not because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but for leverage with Alpha. Something is certain to go wrong with this strategy. Then the People\u2019s Court is convened with Judge Gabe presiding, and with Daryl voting to spare Negan\u2019s life, the panel is deadlocked. So Gabe does what any inspirational leader would \u2014 he sleeps on it. Thanks for the anticlimax, G-man.\n\nSomehow, Negan manages to escape his cell, and, plot twist, it wasn\u2019t Lydia who set him free. The kid gives Daryl a speech about how everyone at A-town acts all righteous, but they\u2019re all wearing masks, too, looking for people to blame and not practicing the kindness they espouse. (Maybe if she saw what Negan did to Glenn\u2019s head, Lydia wouldn\u2019t be such a fangirl.) With Negan on the loose, Michonne is off to Oceanside because it seems that the Whisperers are watching them, too. Luke joins her, but let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s just hoping to get laid.\n\nAs it all winds down, that damn song plays again. (I\u2019m a sucker for soundtrack moments, but when music does most of the emotional heavy lifting, the heartstring tug feels a bit unearned.) Carol looks to the horizon pensively as Daryl scrubs \u201cSilence the Whisperers\u201d off of his front door. But now there\u2019s graffiti all over A-Town, and like Alpha herself, it will take more than a little scrubbing to clean away those stains.", "description": "Big moves by Alpha and Negan turn the cracks in Hilltop and A-Town into chasms.
