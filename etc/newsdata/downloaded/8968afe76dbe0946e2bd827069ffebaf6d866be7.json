By comparison, the ratio between commercial and residential tax rates were significantly lower in Airdrie (1.8-to-1) and Cochrane (1.4-to-1).\n\nLikewise in Edmonton, while the regional average ratio between commercial and residential tax rates was 1.7-to-1, the City of Edmonton had a 2.5-to-1 ratio, which is higher than Strathcona (1.8-to-1) and St. Albert (1.4-to-1).\n\nCrucially, higher tax rates on businesses can erode competitiveness, leading to migration of businesses, reduced hiring and investment, and business closures.\n\n\u201cIn both Calgary and Edmonton, businesses face a higher property tax burden than residents, with little justification for the higher rates,\u201d Filipowicz said.\n\n\"Property taxes should reflect the level of services used by ratepayers, so local and provincial governments need to demonstrate how businesses in Calgary and Edmonton consume two to three times the local services that residents do.\"\n\nMEDIA CONTACT:\n\nJosef Filipowicz, Senior Policy Analyst\n\nFraser Institute\n\nTo arrange media interviews or for more information, please contact:\n\nBryn Weese, Associate Director, Communications\n\nFraser Institute\n\nTel: (604) 688-0221 ext. 589\n\nE-mail: bryn.weese@fraserinstitute.org\n\nFollow the Fraser Institute on Twitter | Like us on Facebook", "description": "", "authors": ["Fraser Institute"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/497700?filename=497700.jpg&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
