And, while you\u2019re here, follow us on Twitter!\n\nWelcome back to Byte Me, our feminist newsletter that makes everyone mad <3\n\nSince we last spoke, Anouk co-wrote and produced a (Dutch) video series called Kramp and it got over 2M views, Cara was accidentally interviewed by Popeye magazine about her football prowess, and Georgina was interviewed by Unfold about her newsletter prowess (and Byte Me). God, we\u2019re talented.\n\nEach month, our gloriously gifted designer, Sa\u00efna, illustrates a weird comment or tweet we receive from one of TNW\u2019s misogynistic, or just odd, readers. Here\u2019s this month\u2019s:\n\nThey should fit right in if they visit the Forbidden Planet.#Astronauts #NASA pic.twitter.com/XzOvFw3tHy \u2014 Marty MacLaughlin (@MartyMacLaugh) October 18, 2019\n\nEhm, sure, Marty. Let us illustrate that for you:\n\nBY THE WAY! Are you on Twitter? Cos we are. We just launched @byte_me.\n\nFollow us and please be gentle.\n\nthe bloody news\n\nthat\u2019s what she said: are \u201cwomen-only\u201d events good or bad for feminism\n\nBecause we\u2019re all magical and unique snowflakes who don\u2019t always agree on feminist issues \u2014 and subsequently feel like we\u2019re \u201cbad\u201d women \u2014 we\u2019re going to discuss something we found online in each newsletter.\n\nFor this month\u2019s that\u2019s what she said, we\u2019re discussing being a \u201ctoken woman\u201d and positive discrimination. We\u2019ve linked to our full discussion here, and included the TL;DR below\u2026\n\nCara: On one hand, I can definitely see why women would want to attend women-orientated events, especially in an industry like tech which is so male-dominated. But equality can\u2019t be achieved without including men in the conversation.\n\nAnouk: I think \u2018mixed\u2019 events are more helpful in the long run, because you want men to listen to these kinds of talks and discussions, too, otherwise you\u2019re just preaching to the choir.\n\nGeorgina: Agreed, but then again, sometimes mixed events take on the same dynamics as a male-dominated office \u2014 when a lot of men enter a space they\u2019re comfortable with because they\u2019ve always had access to it without discrimination, they dominate it.\n\nAnouk: It\u2019s definitely okay to market your event as \u201cwomen-friendly\u201d or whatever label you want to use\u2026 just the \u2018NO MEN ALLOWED\u2019 is taking it too far, I think, and not that helpful for long-term changes.\n\nGeorgina: But the fact is, there are plenty of male-only spaces, even if they aren\u2019t marketed as such, so female-only spaces are about tipping the scales, and allowing us the \u201cboys club\u201d that men have in business and tech.\n\nThere\u2019s room for women-only events, but you need to understand you\u2019re probably just preaching to the choir. So they have to have a certain purpose beyond just \u201csexism is bad.\u201d\n\nAnouk: Yeah agreed, but what would that purpose be? The problem I see is: women-in-tech events want to solve inequality in tech\u2026 they want to solve the very problem they\u2019re perpetuating.\n\nCara: Well it\u2019s also giving space to women to speak freely in an environment that\u2019s usually dominated by men.\n\nGeorgina: Sometimes women just need spaces to strategize against the patriarchy, like a coven of witches dancing around a fire.\n\nYou can check out our full discussion here.\n\nFeel free to comment on the document with your thoughts, or send us an email\n\nthe best and the worst\n\nIn this section, we ask women much smarter than us about the best and worst piece of professional advice they\u2019ve ever received. This week we\u2019re throwing it back to our AMA with Estelle Caswell, the presenter of Vox video series, Earworm.\n\nCredit: Estelle Caswell\n\nThe best?\n\n\u201cYou can change careers and jobs as much as you want. (That was a very freeing piece of advice to embrace.)\u201d\n\nThe worst?\n\n\u201cGet very good at one thing.\u201d\n\ntweets of the month\n\nfeminism started the first time someone said i\u2019m not team edward or team jacob i\u2019m team bella \u2014 dirt prince (@pant_leg) October 20, 2019\n\nThe first coder was a woman. The first writer of a compiler was a woman. Even the word \u201ccomputer\u201d was originally a job title for people, mostly women, who did business-related arithmetic. Yet, some people claim the reason women are underrepresented in tech is lack of interest. \u2014 Kareem\ud83d\udd2510x statistician\ud83d\udd25Carr (@kareem_carr) October 19, 2019\n\nwhen a woman tweets an opinion https://t.co/bHaEM0yGm1 \u2014 Abby Tomlinson (@twcuddleston) October 23, 2019\n\nword of the month\n\nNext up in our new and improved Dicktionary (sorry):\n\nRemember \u2018girl boss,\u2019 the cutesy-feminist term coined by Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso? Meet her older, affluent, pantsuit-wearing sister: SheEO.\n\nLet\u2019s get some obvious issues out of the way first. Yes, we know this kind of gendered language is problematic \u2013 CEOs and bosses can be women too, making the word women-specific only perpetuates inequality, blah blah blah\u2026 but these things are meant to be tongue in cheek, right? No female entrepreneur in her right mind would actually introduce herself as \u201cAngela Jones, SheEO\u201d to potential new investors. At least, we fucking hope not.\n\nStill, the mere existence of \u2018SheEO\u2019 has inspired a bunch of whiny pieces online. \u201cDon\u2019t call me a She-EO,\u201d is the headline of this op-ed a British entrepreneur penned for the Telegraph. She describes her career path, and brings up valid issues like the gender pay gap and unconscious bias in the workplace. But after reading the whole article, it\u2019s clear nobody actually did call her a \u201cSheEO\u201d \u2013 she just doesn\u2019t care for the term and thought it would make a catchy headline.\n\nSo let\u2019s not make this problem bigger than it is. And if it makes you feel good, by all means, call yourself a SheEO (loser). Join a whole tribe of SheEO goddesses, for all we care. (They exist, we can\u2019t make this shit up.) Hell, you don\u2019t even need to run a company. Or have a job. After all, we\u2019re not the boss of you. (We actually are, but you wouldn\u2019t know that.) You are the boss of you. #bossbabe. #empowerment. #shetribe.\n\nHere\u2019s how to use \u201cSheEO\u201d a sentence:\n\n\u201cAfter becoming SheEO for a large energy conglomerate, she struggled with imposter syndrome.\u201d\n\n\u201c6 hacks to look like SheEO material in the workplace.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget\u2026\n\n<3 The TNW shrews\n\nCara (cara@thenextweb.com)\n\nAnouk (anouk@thenextweb.com)\n\n& Georgina (georgina@thenextweb.com)", "description": "Welcome back to Byte Me, our feminist newsletter that makes everyone mad <3", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FCopy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled-Design-4.png&signature=d6e4a881d75db8e097df0398bf8cbbd1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
