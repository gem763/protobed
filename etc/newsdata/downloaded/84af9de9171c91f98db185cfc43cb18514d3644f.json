How mad,\u2019 Charli told i-D.\n\nRecalling the encounter, the 27-year-old continued: \u2018The conversation was so quick and normal. It just flowed.\n\n\u2018First, he was like: \u201cHey! Release Taxi, I\u2019m so excited for the show \u2013 by the way, my mum passed away.\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d so he said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, can you just take a picture of you holding her ashes?\u201d\u2019\n\nAdmitting to be totally taken aback by the situation, she continued: \u2018Then it happened, and now it\u2019s online.\n\nThe star admits she was taken aback (Picture: Ricky Vigil M/GC Images)\n\n\u2018My face is sort of like\u2026. Well, you can see it in my eyes, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I sign a lot of poppers, people ask me to say \u201cgay rights\u201d a lot \u2014 but like, great! Gay rights! But yeah, holding the ashes was\u2026 new, and hopefully a one time thing.\u2019\n\nThroughout the course of her tour, Charli, who has a strong LGBTQ+ following, has been asked to pose with a number of, erm, inappropriate items predominantly by her gay male fans.\n\nAs well as the ashes, these have included numerous bottles of legal highs, and even a douche.\n\nhave some respect. that\u2019s all. \u2014 Charli (@charli_xcx) October 30, 2019\n\nMany fans online have slammed this behaviour, accusing this subsection of her following of putting the 1999 singer in an uncomfortable position during her free meet and greets \u2013 a rareity in the music industry.\n\nThings got even more questionable after the fan who asked Charli to sign the (he later clarified unused) douche admitted that the singer had had no idea what the item was.\n\n\u2018I asked her to hold my poppers to my nose and she politely declined which I respect,\u2019 he tweeted, \u2018so I asked if she would sign this and she was like what is dis hunny [sic].\u2019\n\n\u2018Hope the clout was worth it?\u2019 one follower wrote in response. \u2018This is honestly one of the most disrespectful things I\u2019ve ever see a \u201cfan\u201d do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it seems like Charli might agree, simply tweeting: \u2018Have some respect. That\u2019s all.\u2019\n\nCharli XCX\u2019s tour continues tonight at the Albert Hall in Manchester.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
