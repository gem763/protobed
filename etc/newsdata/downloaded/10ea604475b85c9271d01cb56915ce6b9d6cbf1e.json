Brewer III, the NRA\u2019s attorney. \u201cThere can be no place in our society for this manner of behavior by government officials. Fortunately, the NRA, like all U.S. citizens, is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\n\"Put simply, the government cannot discriminate against citizens based on the viewpoint of their political speech.\" Read the rest of the suit here: https://t.co/bnD7nGUZFt (2/2) pic.twitter.com/IYKwaANmhI \u2014 NRA (@NRA) September 10, 2019\n\nThe resolution was passed last week and accuses the group of using \"its considerable wealth and organizational strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence.\"\n\nSupervisor Catherine Stefani introduced the resolution after the shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, which killed three people, including two children.\n\n\"The National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence,\" the resolution states. \"The National Rifle Association through its advocacy has armed those individuals who would and have committed acts of terrorism.\"\n\nNRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said the group will keep never give up its fight for gun rights.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit comes with a message to those who attack the NRA: We will never stop fighting for our law-abiding members and their constitutional freedoms,\" he said. \"Some politicians forget that all 5 million of us in the NRA stand for freedom and that we believe it is a cause worth fighting for. We will always confront illegal and discriminatory practices against our organization and the millions of members we serve.\u201d", "description": ".09/10/2019 19:27:52PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/55/766b6b6c-dc26-4714-baf1-f2be88c5195f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
