Many ineligible French women travel abroad to undergo IVF treatment.\n\nSandrine Rudnicki, 38, a single woman who lives near Orleans in central France, went to Denmark for IVF treatment and now is the mother of a 10-month-old daughter, Emilia.\n\nShe said she\u2019s \u201cdelighted\u201d in-vitro fertilization is set to become legal for women like her because she feels like her family of two is \u201cnot accepted\u201d under the current situation.\n\nRudnicki estimated it cost about 10,000 euros ($10,997), travel included, for her to get IVF in another country.\n\n\u201cThis erases all sorts of inequalities,\u201d she said added.\n\nLesbian couples, single women or both already have legal access to medically assisted reproduction in 18 of the European Union\u2019s 28 countries.\n\nFrance\u2019s pending legislation also would allow children conceived with donated sperm to find out the donor\u2019s identity upon demand when they reach age 18, a change from France\u2019s current strict donor anonymity protections.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s something which is indispensable. It will enable these children to have a foundation, a reference\u201d Rudnicki said.\n\nThe legislation does not address surrogate motherhood arrangements, which are banned in France.\n\nIf passed by the National Assembly, the bill next would go to the Senate for debate.\n\nEarlier this month, tens of thousands of conservative activists of all ages marched through Paris to oppose the bill. The Oct. 6 protest was organized by the same groups behind 2013 demonstrations against France legalizing same-sex marriages.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "France's lower house of parliament is expected to approve a bill that would give single women and lesbian couples legal access to in vitro fertilization, egg freezing and fertility medication.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sylvie Corbet", "Catherine Gaschka"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/france_reproductive_rights_04080_c0-271-3850-2516_s1200x700.jpg?5ba2b4cb3bb1f968a3b493df8052df2f3a4a81b2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
