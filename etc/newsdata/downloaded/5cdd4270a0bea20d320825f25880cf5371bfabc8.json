The caption read:\n\n\u201cSimi kunye kulesisimo\u201d \u2013 \u2018We stand together in this moment\u2019\n\n\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex has tied a ribbon at the site where 19-year-old Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana was murdered last month, to pay her respects and to show solidarity with those who have taken a stand against gender based violence and femicide. Over the last month in Capetown, protests erupted through the streets in outrage over GBV in South Africa.\n\n\n\nThe Duke and Duchess had been following what had happened from afar and were both eager to learn more when they arrived in South Africa. The Duchess spoke to the mother of Uyinene this week to relay their condolences.\n\n\n\nVisiting the site of this tragic death and being able to recognise Uyinene, and all women and girls effected by GBV (specifically in South Africa, but also throughout the world) was personally important to The Duchess.\n\n\n\nUyinene\u2019s death has mobilised people across South Africa in the fight against gender based violence, and is seen as a critical point in the future of women\u2019s rights in South Africa. The Duchess has taken private visits and meetings over the last two days to deepen her understanding of the current situation and continue to advocate for the rights of women and girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 2 - Visit to Bo Kaap\n\nThe couple started their day with a visit to Monwabisi beach where they met the organisation Waves For Change, which helps children and young people experiencing mental health issues.\n\nMeghan, who wore a casual denim jacket and white shirt combination for the outing, and Harry sat down with the young people on the beach chatting, clapping and all had to speak about one strength they had.\n\nIt was during this moment that one of the coaches suggested to Meghan her strength was dancing after the Duchess had danced with a group of women the day before in Cape Town, which she laughed off, according to Hello!\n\nPhoto credit: Samir Hussein - Getty Images More\n\nShe reportedly added her new strength is parenting and that she and Harry are 'learning and developing' every day since Archie's June birth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "In 'solidarity with those who have taken a stand against gender based violence and femicide'", "authors": ["Olivia Blair", "Daisy Murray"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1JzEnDKXbaZ9VeyT3FWi.A--~B/aD0yNjU7dz01Mjc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/9b4b9d554676edf8e20dd7b487cf9d25", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
