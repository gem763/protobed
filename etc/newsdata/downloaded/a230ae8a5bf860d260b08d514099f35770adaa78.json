LOUIS (AP) \u2014 It turns out Washington\u2019s Big Three is a Big Four.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe right-hander carried a no-hit bid into the eighth inning, Howie Kendrick had two more big swings and the Nationals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-0 on Friday night in the NL Championship Series opener.\n\nS\u00e1nchez had allowed just three runners when he took the mound for the eighth. First baseman Ryan Zimmerman robbed Tommy Edman with an outstanding diving grab at full stretch for the first out, but pinch-hitter Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez cleanly singled to center with two down for the Cardinals\u2019 first hit.\n\nSean Doolittle relieved and got four straight outs to finish the one-hitter for his first postseason save in two years.\n\nS\u00e1nchez and Doolittle made life easy on manager Dave Martinez on the chilly night after the Nationals placed closer Daniel Hudson on the paternity list before the franchise\u2019s first appearance in the NLCS since the Montreal Expos moved to Washington ahead of the 2005 season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t claim to be superstitious, but when you got a no-hitter \u2014 I was freezing my butt off and didn\u2019t want to put a jacket on,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI stayed with this, just this sweat shirt, the whole game.\u201d\n\nGame 2 is back at Busch Stadium on Saturday. Washington ace Max Scherzer starts in his hometown, and Adam Wainwright gets the ball for St. Louis. Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin will follow when the series moves to Nationals Park.\n\n\u201cPeople were talking about the big three,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said, \u201cbut we got a guy tonight that we got to contend with and not overlook him.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis wasted a solid performance by Miles Mikolas, who pitched six innings of one-run ball in his second career playoff start.\n\nWashington scored each of its runs with two outs. Kendrick doubled and came home on Yan Gomes\u2019 double in the second. Kendrick then singled in Adam Eaton in the seventh after Kendrick reached on a one-out triple against Giovanny Gallegos.\n\nKendrick also had the big blow in Washington\u2019s Game 5 victory at Los Angeles on Wednesday night, a 10th-inning grand slam.\n\nGomes finished with two hits while subbing for catcher Kurt Suzuki, who left the Nationals\u2019 clinching victory against the Dodgers with a head injury.\n\nS\u00e1nchez became the first pitcher to start two postseason games with six hitless innings. Facing Boston for Detroit in the 2013 AL Championship Series opener, he was replaced by Al Alburquerque at the start of the seventh. The Tigers won 1-0, allowing their only hit when Daniel Nava singled of Joaquin Benoit with one out in the ninth.\n\nS\u00e1nchez got his first playoff win since he struck out 12 in that game. He threw a no-hitter for the Florida Marlins in his 13th big league start as a rookie in 2006 and also has pitched four one-hitters.\n\nHe started this year 0-6 in his first nine starts but went 11-2 in his final 19.\n\nFor a while, it looked as if he might be headed to the third no-hitter in postseason history.\n\nS\u00e1nchez retired his first 10 batters before Kolten Wong walked in the fourth on a cool, breezy evening.\n\nWong stole second and took third on Gomes\u2019 throwing error, but Marcell Ozuna hit an inning-ending foulout.\n\nPinch-hitter Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch with one out in the sixth, but the 35-year-old S\u00e1nchez retired Dexter Fowler and Wong. He plunked Yadier Molina in the seventh before Matt Carpenter bounced out.\n\nS\u00e1nchez struck out five in ninth career postseason start. He threw 67 of his 103 pitches for strikes.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: Suzuki and OF Victor Robles (strained right hamstring) were out of the starting lineup after they got hurt in the Division Series. Manager Dave Martinez said Robles is about 80 to 85 percent. \u201cTo me it\u2019s worth him missing another day or two to get him fully back, hopefully,\u201d he said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nScherzer struck out 10 while pitching eight innings of one-run ball against the Dodgers. Wainwright threw 7 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 3 of the NLDS against the Braves.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "ST.
