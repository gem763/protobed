REUTERS/Ari Jalal\n\nJamila, who asked not to be identified by her last name, is one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority religion who were kidnapped and raped by IS after it mounted an assault on the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in August 2014.\n\n\u201cEven if Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead, it doesn\u2019t mean Islamic State is dead,\u201d Jamila told Reuters outside the tent that is now her temporary home in the Sharya camp for displaced Yazidis in Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan Region.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like justice yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI want the men who took me, who raped me, to stand trial. And I want to have my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ... Without proper trials, his death has no meaning.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday.\n\nInspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis, whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against them.\n\nAlong with thousands of other women and children, Jamila said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister.\n\nShe was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she said, their guards were high on drugs.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and psychological problems for two years, so I couldn\u2019t go to school,\u201d she said.\n\nNow instead of working or catching up on her years of lost schooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her cramped tent at the camp.\n\n\u201cMy mother can\u2019t walk and has health problems so I have to stay and take care of her because my older siblings are in Germany,\u201d she said.\n\nNO PLANS TO GO HOME\n\nThe prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not an option for Jamila, and many others. The city still lies in ruin four years after the IS onslaught, and suspicion runs deep in the ethnically mixed area.\n\n\u201cSinjar is completely destroyed. Even if we could go back, I wouldn\u2019t want to because we\u2019d be surrounded by the same Arab neighbours who all joined IS in the first place, and helped them kill us (Yazidis),\u201d she said.\n\nThousands of men are being tried in Iraqi courts for their ties to IS. Iraq has so far not allowed victims to testify in court, something community leaders and human rights groups say would go a long way in the healing process.\n\n\u201cIt is deplorable that not a single victim of Islamic State\u2019s horrific abuses including sexual slavery has gotten their day in court,\u201d said Belkis Wille, Iraq Researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cIraq\u2019s justice system is designed to allow the state to exact mass revenge against suspects, not provide real accountability for victims.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nFor some of the nearly 17,000 Yazidis at the Sharya camp, Baghdadi\u2019s death was a first step in that direction though they fear the IS fighters who are still alive.\n\nMayan Sinu, 25, can dream of a new life after the camp as she and her three children have been granted asylum by Australia. But she also wants the men who shot her husband in the legs and dragged him off to be brought to justice. He has been missing since the incident five years ago.\n\n\u201cI hope Baghdadi is suffering more than we ever did, and my God we suffered,\u201d said Sinu. \u201cI wish he (Baghdadi) hadn\u2019t blown himself up so I could have slaughtered him myself with my bare hands.\u201d", "description": "Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death will mean nothing to 19-year-old rape victim Jamila unless the Islamic State militants who enslaved her are brought to justice.", "authors": ["Raya Jalabi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446459369&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0ID", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
