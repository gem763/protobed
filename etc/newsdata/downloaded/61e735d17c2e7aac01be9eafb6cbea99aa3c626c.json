REUTERS/Yana Paskova\n\nSome people in Pakistan\u2019s portion of Kashmir said thousands of people were preparing to storm the line of control (LOC) - a ceasefire line agreed with India that is one of the most militarised frontiers in the world. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.\n\nBut regional tensions have swelled since India stripped its portion of Kashmir of autonomy in August, made mass arrests, limited communications and imposed curfew-like restrictions in some areas to contain a decades-long uprising against New Delhi\u2019s rule.\n\nKhan has appealed to Kashmiris to give him the chance to sway the international community and he is scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, but patience appears to be in short supply in Pakistani Kashmir.\n\n\u201cWe are all waiting for the United Nations...to see if the world can help us. Otherwise, we will try to break the LOC border,\u201d said Habib Urhman Afaqi, the president of the Jamaat-e-Islami political party for the district of Kotli, near the LOC. He said tens of thousands of men around the region were organising by word of mouth and social media.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing people, emotionally, and collectively we will be ready to fight on 27 September,\u201d Afaqi said.\n\nAs of Thursday, there were no signs of any gathering of people in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan\u2019s portion of Kashmir which is about 30 km (18 miles) from the LOC. Political leaders in the region said they were waiting until after Khan\u2019s speech to take action.\n\nKhan has strongly criticised New Delhi\u2019s actions in Kashmir in an international diplomacy campaign and cut off trade ties, but has condemned the plan to storm the LOC. He said in a speech this month that anyone who attempted to cross the border risked drawing the ire of India, losing international sympathy and would be an \u201cenemy of Kashmir\u201d.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military said it would not allow any one to cross the LOC.\n\n\u201cPakistan is making all peaceful/diplomatic efforts to awaken world conscience to get them (Kashmiris) relief,\u201d the military\u2019s media wing said in an e-mail. \u201cHowever, as stated earlier Pakistan keeps all options open and shall go to any extent as regards resolution of the Kashmir dispute.\u201d\n\n\u201cCANON FODDER\u201d\n\nBoth India and Pakistan are nuclear powers and have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.\n\nA spokesman for the Indian military warned against using Kashmiris as \u201ccanon fodder\u201d and said he hoped Pakistan would ensure the LOC was not breached.\n\n\u201cThe Indian army is aware of the public utterances of Pakistani leaders aimed at instigating unarmed civilians,\u201d the spokesman said in response to a question from Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that they are being sent on harm\u2019s way to create a humanitarian crisis to draw world attention.\u201d\n\nKhan told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would appeal in his speech for United Nations intervention in Kashmir but was not optimistic he could accomplish much in the short-term. He warned of large-scale violence in Indian Kashmir when the restrictions on civilian movements were lifted.\n\nKashmir has been Pakistan\u2019s single most pressing foreign policy issue since it was born out of British colonial India, but some Pakistani Kashmiris say Khan is being weak.\n\n\u201cImran Khan has nothing at stake and this decision whether to trample down or storm the LOC should be of the Kashmiris,\u201d said Subiyal Rasheed, a 35-year old software engineer from the town of Rawalakot, who says he is speaking with other young men about storming the LOC en masse.\n\nMemes using the hashtag\u201d#TweetoSultan\u201d went viral in recent weeks, a play on historic Muslim warrior Tipu Sultan and a dig at Khan that his battle was being waged through ineffective emotional tweets.\n\nKhan told reporters in New York this week that he was doing everything he could.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t attack India, clearly that is not an option, and apart from that we\u2019re doing everything possible we could do,\u201d Khan said.\n\nIndia, which says its revocation of Kashmir\u2019s special status will allow the region to develop economically, has long accused Pakistan of training, arming and sending militants to Kashmir.\n\nPakistan denies this and says it only provides diplomatic and moral support to non-violent separatists in the region.\n\nKhan has stepped up his warnings this month that India is planning a \u2018false flag\u2019 attack on its own soil to give it an excuse to attack Pakistan, a claim India denies.\n\nSyed Salahuddin, a Kashmiri militant commander who heads an alliance of over a dozen groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, said in a speech this month that \u201charsh steps\u201d from Pakistan\u2019s government had hindered his groups\u2019 ability to take action.\n\nHe later said in an interview that Pakistan should send troops across the border or convince the United Nations to send peacekeeping troops there.\n\n\u201cPakistan has been extending us political and moral support...but the Kashmiris want some practical steps,\u201d he told Reuters by phone, declining to answer further questions.", "description": "As Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan prepares to deliver another appeal to the world to address the situation in Kashmir, he faces the risk that rising anger in his country's portion of the disputed region could spiral into a confrontation with India.", "authors": ["Abu Arqam Naqash", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434095514&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0OS", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
