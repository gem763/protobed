This fall, the southeast is seeing some serious heat as summer-like conditions simply won't retreat, and October is expected to reach record highs.\n\nWhile temperatures are expected to leap 10 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit above average across the Deep South up to the Ohio Valley, this isn't the first time that the US has seen some especially hot fall months.\n\nAcross the Dakotas, Idaho, and Minnesota, heat peaked over 120 years ago as September 1897 brought exceptionally warm state-wide average temperatures. Flash forward to 1939, and five states in the Midwest and south saw a scorching September.\n\nEven as recently as 2015, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wyoming all saw substantially higher temperatures than normal for September (perhaps not shocking, as 2015 is the second hottest year on record currently). Utah beat its record just last year.\n\nAs humans inject more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, scientists expect temperatures to rise 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years, so we'll likely see many more heat records broken in the decades to come.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the hottest fall months ever recorded in each state, and the year that those temperatures broke out, according to data from NOAA. Interestingly, most of them occurred in September.", "description": "The September already feels like a scorcher.
