In the case of Trump\u2019s tweet, the tweet remains up, but the accompanying parody video has been removed.\n\nMany users argue that this is an overreach of copyright rules, and that there is an argument that the clip is fair use given that only a few seconds of a Nickelback video were used, for the purpose of parody.\n\nThis video def clears Fair Use\u2019s four factor test: 1. Purpose (parody)\n\n2. Nature of the work (it\u2019s a transformative use, not just copying)\n\n3. Amount (a few seconds)\n\n4. Effect on market (no one will avoid buying this song b/c a few seconds are available in Trump\u2019s video) https://t.co/N1NvTjnb2D \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 3, 2019\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
