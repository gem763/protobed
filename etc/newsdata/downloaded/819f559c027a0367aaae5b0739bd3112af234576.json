This Tudor-style home in the Perth Hills is just one of three replicas of the great William Shakespeare\u2019s original family home.\n\nBuilt in 1975 by late English engineer Leo Fowler, the property is part of a small Elizabethan village at 25 Canns Road, Bedfordale, which includes a copy of Shakespeare\u2019s wife Anne Hathaway\u2019s cottage, and is based on the Bard\u2019s birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\nFowler moved to Western Australia with his wife, Margaret, in 1974 with grand plans to establish an entire Elizabethan village, including an English restaurant. But it was never completed due to ill health and he sold to a local businessman.\n\nCurrent owner Tina Alexander, who has lived in the special home for 16 years, says she was attracted to the property because of her love of Tudor homes, but concedes she is not an overt lover of literature.\n\n\u201cI like history and I love bold architecture \u2013 things that make a statement. This is not just an ordinary, run-of-the-mill place and that\u2019s what really drew me here,\u201d Alexander says.\n\n\u201cI never really was a Shakespeare fan and I\u2019m not into reading or writing, although I do poetry. But when I moved in I just wanted to know more about what Shakespeare did, so I had all these books and I read up a lot about Shakespeare.\u201d\n\nSet on 1848sqm, the three-storey five-bedroom, five-bathroom home has four living areas, four fireplaces and unique pantry doors in the country kitchen.\n\n\u201cAlthough the house is big, it still feels homely,\u201d Alexander says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great for entertaining because it\u2019s so theatrical. We\u2019ve held so many events \u2013 Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, gothic, medieval, Mad Hatter\u2019s party themed events.\u201d\n\nReplica Bard home in Bedfordale The dining room features timber beams and ornate wall decorations.

Picture: realestate.com.au\n\nBuilt from timber from the old Barrack Street and Busselton jetties, Toodyay stone, clay shingle tiles and leadlight windows sourced from England, the property has been modelled to precision on the original, even mimicking its imperfections and a secret room.\n\n\u201cThere is a secret room,\u201d Alexander says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big panel so when you close it it looks like the end of the house, but there is a room behind it. That was for all their valuables and grains \u2013 they would store everything of value in that room in England.\u201d\n\nOpened by Sir Charles Court in 1977 as a tourist attraction, it won the 1978 Sir David Brand Award for Tourism and still retains the original ticketing office.\n\nIt transitioned to a private residence about 30 years ago.\n\nAlexander, who operated a bed and breakfast from the distinctive residence for years, says her home remains a local icon, with tourists and passersby still stopping to admire it.\n\n\u201cIt attracted so many people through the 1970s and 80s as being the most authentic replica of Shakespeare\u2019s house and Anne Hathaway\u2019s next door\u2026 I still get people coming through. They are so attracted to the place that in the end I ask them if they want to come in and have a look.\u201d\n\nAlexander has decided to sell so she can invest in a property where she is able to take care of her aging parents.\n\nThe property has been listed for sale from $1.05 million to $1.25 million and is being marketed by Aydin Palermo, from Oradin Property Maida Vale.", "description": "To buy or not to buy, that is the question.
