Bush says his sentence should be vacated because the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi shows Saudi Arabia lies about the brutality of its security forces.\n\nAhmed Omar Abu Ali was convicted in 2005. A key piece of evidence was a confession he gave in Saudi custody. Abu Ali said the confession was tortured out of him by Saudi Arabia\u2019s internal security agency.\n\nSaudi agents testified under assumed names at Abu Ali\u2019s trial, denying any torture.\n\nIn a motion filed Wednesday in federal court in Alexandria, Abu Ali\u2019s lawyer argues Khashoggi\u2019s killing last year is evidence Saudi security forces will lie about mistreatment they inflict. Saudi Arabia initially denied any responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s death.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
