Tammy Duckworth\n\nThat line came from Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth during a Wednesday hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee titled \u201cMass Violence, Extremism and Digital Responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s chairman, Mississippi Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, noted in his opening remarks that gunmen in some mass shootings have posted manifestos online before launching their attacks. Wicker also stressed that President Donald Trump has asked social media companies to develop tools that can detect would-be shooters before they strike.\n\nBut Duckworth wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cHere we are not focused on ways to stop gun violence, but instead the scourge of social media,\u201d the lawmaker from Illinois said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say there\u2019s no connection, but every other country on the planet has social media, video games, online harassment, hate groups, crime and mental health issues, but they don\u2019t have mass shootings like we do.\u201d\n\nShe displayed a large chart showing how the U.S. is \u201csomewhere in the middle of the pack\u201d in terms of use of social media, with the Philippines having the heaviest usage and Japan the least. Wicker later asked her to get the big charts that she displayed into a smaller format so they could be entered into the record, and she thanked him for that.\n\nThe hearing, which aimed to look at how social media giants are handling violent or threatening content on their platforms, featured testimony from Facebook Inc.\u2019s FB, +0.03% head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, as well as Twitter Inc.\u2019s TWTR, +0.00% public policy director, Nick Pickles, and Derek Slater, the global director of information at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG, +0.27% GOOGL, +0.23% Google.\n\nRelated: Senator doesn\u2019t believe Google official who says company doesn\u2019t aim to persuade users\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott \u2014 who was that state\u2019s governor at the time of its Parkland shooting \u2014 emphasized that confessed shooter Nikolas Cruz had posted threatening comments on Google\u2019s YouTube and other online platforms, but that didn\u2019t lead the FBI or Google to take steps to prevent Cruz\u2019s attack on his former school.\n\n\u201cAre you comfortable that if another Nikolas Cruz put something up, you have the process now that you\u2019ll contact somebody and there\u2019ll be a follow-up process?\u201d Scott asked Google\u2019s Slater.\n\nSlater responded as follows: \u201cOur processes are getting better all the time. They are robust. I think this is an area where it\u2019s an evolving challenge, both because technology evolves, because people\u2019s tactics evolve. They might use code words and so on.\u201d\n\nThe hearing is another example of the increased scrutiny that Silicon Valley is facing in Washington, as regulators and lawmakers blast tech giants for how they have handled their users\u2019 personal data, while also raising antitrust concerns and other worries.\n\nRelated: News cycle is daily reminder of Big Tech\u2019s antitrust vulnerabilities\n\nAnd see: Senate panel grills DOJ, FTC chiefs over their antitrust probes into Big Tech", "description": "The remarks from Sen.
