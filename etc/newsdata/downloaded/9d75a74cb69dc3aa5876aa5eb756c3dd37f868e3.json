The president\u2019s opponents quickly seized on it as another example of Trump abusing his office for personal gain. Even many Republicans seemed reluctant to offer political cover.\n\nAD\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney tried to defend the decision during a news conference but caused a new controversy when he was asked about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president that sparked the impeachment inquiry. Mulvaney told reporters that Trump had held up nearly $400 million in aid to push the foreign government to investigate Democrats, comments that undercut Trump\u2019s central defense in the inquiry. When a journalist followed up, saying that Mulvaney seemed to be describing a quid pro quo, Mulvaney said \u201cwe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Mulvaney expressed regret about how he handled the two issues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that if we made the decision [to move the G-7] on Thursday, we wouldn\u2019t have had the news conference on Thursday regarding everything else, but that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment of a mistake \u2014 he also said Sunday that the news conference had been less than \u201cperfect\u201d \u2014 comes as Trump has privately expressed displeasure with his acting chief\u2019s job performance and as some White House officials are seeking to replace him, according to several people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private discussions. Several officials said Trump\u2019s aides and allies are considering options for a new chief of staff.\n\nOn Friday, White House press officials said Trump continued to support Mulvaney. \u201cMick Mulvaney\u2019s standing in the White House has not changed,\u201d White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nAD\n\nBut the chief of staff may have damaged that standing with his Fox News interview, in which he explained Trump\u2019s desire to host the G-7 at his property by saying the president \u201cstill considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile several Trump allies said the comment was accurate, they said it was a bad idea for Mulvaney to make it in public. Other top Republicans, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have begun to distance themselves from Mulvaney, who released a statement Thursday denying his admission of a quid pro quo.\n\nTrump blamed his G-7 reversal on critics, saying on Twitter that his decision to scrap plans for a summit at the Doral club was \u201cbased on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut behind closed doors, several aides and allies said, Trump changed his mind in response to pressure and frustration from his own party.\n\nIn the month since Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry, Republicans have struggled to offer a coherent response. With no White House war room, GOP lawmakers have seized on process-related responses.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, they\u2019re being asked to defend the president\u2019s erratic approach to policymaking, including his abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops and abandon Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria. That announcement was roundly condemned by Republicans, including some of his staunchest defenders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), in a rare public rebuke of Trump, wrote a withering op-ed in The Washington Post on Friday, just days after 129 House Republicans backed a resolution criticizing the president\u2019s move.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to host next year\u2019s G-7 meeting at his private golf club only increased the anxiety among GOP lawmakers, some of whom have grown weary of having to develop new talking points almost daily.\n\nPrivately, and occasionally in public, several Republicans said they were not prepared to defend the president from charges that he was engaged in self-dealing on the G-7 site selection.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) said Friday that Trump should avoid even the appearance of impropriety that comes with holding a global summit at his private property. \u201cI think that would be better if he would not use his hotel for this kind of stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nRooney, who announced his retirement the day after his comments, also said he was considering backing Trump\u2019s impeachment over his handling of Ukraine policy.\n\nTrump has been closely watching Republicans and their comments about impeachment, according to one administration official. The president was told repeatedly his G-7 decision made it more difficult to keep Senate Republicans in a unified front against impeachment proceedings, the official said. Before he changed course, Trump had waved off concerns from advisers who said hosting world leaders at his club would not play well.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was very little support for this in the building even before Mick went out there and did what he did,\u201d an official said.\n\nAD\n\nBefore he took office, Trump made the unprecedented decision to keep ownership of his businesses \u2014 but he promised that he would never use his new power to help them. The Trump Organization\u2019s lawyers promised to avoid even the appearance of \u201cany advantage derived from the Office of the Presidency.\u201d\n\nBut in practice, Trump has continued to boost his businesses \u2014 by talking them up and by visiting them repeatedly, with aides and fellow Republicans in tow.\n\nTrump has visited his properties more than 130 times while in office. As of this summer, those visits had brought him more than $1.6 million in payments from the federal government and Republican campaign groups, which rented Trump\u2019s ballrooms for fundraisers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the past 18 months, Trump has made even more expensive visits to his properties in Ireland, Scotland and South Florida \u2014 visits that took him far out of his way from the official business of his trips. He also suggested Vice President Pence do the same: Pence built his own detour into an official trip and spent extra hours commuting so he could stay at Trump\u2019s club in remote southwestern Ireland. These trips bring attention to Trump\u2019s properties, and they bring revenue.\n\nDemocrats and good governance groups have said Trump is violating the Constitution\u2019s ban on receiving \u201cemoluments\u201d from foreign or domestic sources while president. The decision to host world leaders and U.S. officials at his Doral club during the G-7 was particularly controversial because it would have put Trump at the center of those alleged violations.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been done in the first place,\u201d Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThis was just an unforced error.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChristie said Trump should not be antagonizing Republicans at a time when he will need their votes to protect him in the impeachment process.\n\n\u201cWe have to be in friend-making mode,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump, who has been able to rely on near-unanimous Republican support during his 33 months in office, appeared chastened by the lack of support.\n\n\u201cI thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders,\u201d he tweeted Saturday.\n\nOne former senior administration official said Trump would regularly brag about his properties and ask visitors their opinions while boasting of their amenities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that he really just thinks his properties are the best,\u201d said a longtime adviser to the president. \u201cHe does not understand in his mind why he would have something at someone else\u2019s property.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s critics were less charitable, accusing Trump of trying to make money for his private business by awarding himself a lucrative federal contract.\n\n\u201cThis is why he ran in the first place,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Brien, a Trump biographer and critic. \u201cHe never thought he\u2019d win. It was free marketing.\u201d\n\nMulvaney, who claimed Thursday that the White House had chosen the president\u2019s Doral resort after a nationwide search, said Sunday on Fox that Trump was surprised by the backlash he had received.\n\n\u201cCould we have put on an excellent G-7 at Doral? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we end up putting on an excellent G-7 someplace else? Yes, we will.\u201d", "description": "From the moment the White House announced that President Trump had decided to hold the 2020 Group of Seven summit at his golf resort, it became inextricably linked with his possible impeachment.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "David A.
