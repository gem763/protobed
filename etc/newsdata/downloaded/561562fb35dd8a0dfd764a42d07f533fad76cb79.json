For a limited time, you can get the Nest Learning Thermostat with an external temperature sensor for $70 off at Best Buy.\n\nThere are a ton of things that make the Nest Learning Thermostat such a great device. For starters, the thermostat is super well-designed. It's available in a range of different colors, and features a beautiful stainless steel ring around a glass face, which displays the temperature of your home. You'll use the ring around the edge to control the device's software and raise or lower the temperature.\n\nThe Nest replaces your existing thermostat and can intelligently control your home's heating and cooling setup automatically, so you often don't have to do anything. On top of that, you'll also be able to control the smart thermostat straight from your phone, and it'll learn your routine so that it can adjust the temperature on its own.\n\nThis particular bundle also comes with an external temperature sensor, which can be set up in another room. External sensors are particular helpful in multi-level homes, and they allow users to set the temperature based on where they are in the home \u2014 rather than just a temperature overall.", "description": "The Nest Learning Thermostat is one of our favorite smart thermostats because it is so easy to use.
