founder Pavlo Tanasyuk said: \u201cOur goal is to go there and see what is available there for all humanity to explore.\u201d\n\nHe added that, unlike rovers with wheels or tracks, this robot with four legs would provide an opportunity for \u201csomething a little bit like a human\u201d to explore the lunar surface.\n\nIn May, Nasa announced that Astrobotic and two other companies had been awarded funding to build lunar landers.\n\nAstrobotic was awarded millions of dollars to carry up to 14 Nasa instruments to the moon as well as 14 payloads from other partners.\n\nSpaceBit will be one of those partners, sending the rover to the surface inside Astrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lander.\n\nIt is expected to land near the region of Mare Serenitatis \u2013 the Sea of Serenity \u2013 in June or July 2021.\n\nOnce the lander reaches the moon, the 1.5kg (3lb 5oz) rover will drop from beneath it to the surface along with other payloads.\n\n(PA)\n\nIt will scuttle across the surface taking measurements and collecting exploration data.\n\nThe rover is battery-powered, but a small solar panel will also harness energy from the sun.\n\nIt also has two cameras that will enable it to take \u201crobot selfies\u201d, SpaceBit said.\n\nThe reason for the legs is to allow the robot to enter lava tubes in future missions, which has not been possible before.\n\nUkrainian-born Mr Tanasyuk said: \u201cAfter we land, we will be exploring the moon surface, and hopefully we will be able to the get into the lava tubes and explore the environment there.\n\n\u201cSo we hope to find a stable temperature which will be suited for future human missions to the moon.\n\n\u201cIt is a rugged environment in the lava tubes so you can\u2019t really use wheels there \u2013 that was why we had to design these legs instead of wheels.\u201d\n\nThe SpaceBit rover can withstand temperatures from up to 130C (266F) to minus 130C (minus 202F) at night, and will explore for the duration of a lunar day.\n\nMr Tanasyuk added: \u201cIt will spend up to 10 days on the moon before going into the night and basically freezing forever.\u201d\n\nWhile the robot has an in-house name, this has not been made public as SpaceBit hopes to launch a competition in the UK, asking children to name it.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "The UK\u2019s first ever moon rover will head to the
