It shouldn't need education to show providers what was a quality product and what was not, he said.\n\nRecently it was revealed that governments have made 465 reforms to the training sector in the last 21 years, an average of one every 2 1/2 weeks for more than two decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny Lambert, director of employment, education and training at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the training sectors' approach to assessment needed an overhaul.\n\nASQA knew assessment was no where near what it should have been and had made it a priority in its recent strategy outlook.\n\nThis needed a lot of rethinking given the scale of the job and in the long run assessment of training courses and providers would probably come down to random audits or capstone reviews.\n\nShe said Mr Patterson had rescued the industry's reputation after VET-Fee Help but his organisation had become too focused on compliance.\n\n\"Quality is not just about complaince. It's about how you ensure the system continues to improve. Quality is about the standards of teachers and professionalism.\"\n\nMs Rice, who takes over as interim commissioner today, was formerly the deputy commissioner responsible for risk, intelligence and regulatory support.", "description": "The resignation of former chief commissioner Mark Paterson leaves a massive job for the new boss", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4537%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e80c825a33b7bca40afebb0ac6f64555b36ac740", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
