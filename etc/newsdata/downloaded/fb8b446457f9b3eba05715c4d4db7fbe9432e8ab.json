Up until that point, the only two things I knew about the Yakuza were that the name derived from the unluckiest hand you can be dealt when playing the Japanese card game of Oicho-Kabu (Ya-ku-za literally means \u201ceight-nine-three\u201d) and that tattoos are so synonymous with the Yakuza that literally anyone with any conspicuous ink can be denied admittance to a public baths or onsen in Japan.\n\nMy girlfriend told me that she didn\u2019t remember the guy having any tattoos but she did recall the pearls in his penis. I rewound and reviewed the sentence in my head to see if I should know what she was talking about. I didn\u2019t. \u201cYakuza put pearls in their dicks to make sex better for their partners,\u201d she said, explaining that it\u2019s intended to provide more vaginal or anal stimulation. When I asked her if it worked, she matter-of-factly explained that she was more focused on the unnerving realities of having sexual encounter with a bona fide gangster than the way anything felt.\n\nI was so gripped by the other aspects of her story that I didn\u2019t look into what putting pearls in one\u2019s penis would actually entail until some days later. Based on her brief description, I originally thought that the procedure involved shoving pearls into the penis via the urethral opening as though loading a miniature musket. A 2010 review of the literature concerning the \u201cimplantation of artificial penile nodules\u201d published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, however, gave a comprehensive overview that both confirmed this odd bod mod with organized crime, and gave me a clearer picture of what the procedure entails. Allow me to explain.\n\nKnown as pearling or beading, this sort of body modification requires an incision to be made on the shaft of the penis into which a spherical or sometimes rib-shaped object is placed. Originally pearls were used\u2014hence \u201cpearling\u201d\u2014but implants are also made of silicone, nylon, Teflon, stainless steel, or titanium. Often, a single object is implanted on the dorsal aspect (top side) of the penile shaft though they can be placed in rows or arranged randomly around the circumference and length of the shaft. As you might expect, having pearls installed isn\u2019t without its risks.\n\n\u201cThose undergoing pearling must remember that a foreign body is being implanted into the body.\u201d says New York City-based plastic surgeon Neil Tanna, who adds that placing any implant in the body has the potential to result in bleeding, infection, foreign body migration, and loss of sensation. \u201cIn addition, severe inflammation can result if an unsuitable material is inserted under the skin.\u201d\n\nA knobbly and possibly infected penis might not strike you as aesthetically pleasing\u2014a little too wabi-sabi, to borrow the Japanese phrase that roughly means \"the beauty in the imperfect, impermanent, and asymmetrical.\" But then, increasing sexual pleasure\u2014not the look\u2014is pearling\u2019s primary purpose. I find it fascinating, almost charming, that macho, gang members of patriarchal crime syndicates would care enough about eliciting partners\u2019 sexual pleasure that they\u2019d retrofit their genitals to that end. Then again, it\u2019s worth noting that amongst themselves, Yakuza refer to to various syndicates they belong to as \"ninky\u014d dantai\u201d or \"chivalrous organizations.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, pearling among the Yakuza primarily goes down in prison, each pearl placed under the skin symbolizing a year spent in the big house. Somehow pearling behind bars caught on in the US, too, with inmates using the sharpened end of a plastic spoon to make the incision and stuffing dominos, marbles, and broken-off heads of chess pieces under the skin of their penises. Two summers ago, Vice got four prison inmates to open up about their experiences with pearling in the Hooskow. Somehow, they weren\u2019t pressed on the paradox of making one\u2019s penis ostensibly more pleasurable to female partners when there are none around.\n\nMore from Tonic:\n\nIn that piece, one inmate talks about an ex-prostitute friend of his who reported that sex workers hated the implants as they tend to hurt. Still, the idea that having your penis pearled will make have you wringing orgasms out of your partner by the dozen seems to have taken root. It\u2019s popular in Cuba despite the practice having led to tetanus, balanitis (an inflammation of the head or glans of the penis), and gangrene that ultimately resulted in more than a few penile amputations. It\u2019s also popular among and Filipino sailors. According to one 1999 survey, 57 percent of 314 randomly selected Filipino seafarers were sporting bolitas or little balls, many believing that this actually made them more popular with prostitutes, particularly those in Rio De Janeiro.\n\nCuban sex therapist Almudena L\u00f3pez of M\u00f3stoles University Hospital highly doubts that the pearls work as intended. \"For it to really stimulate the clitoris, the pearl should be placed at the very base of the penis, which never happens,\u201d she told VICE in 2016. \u201cAs for the G-spot, that's something you can easily reach with a finger, but it's much more complicated to reach directly with the penis. Of course eroticism is for a big part a psychological affair, and given that the famous pearl has some mysteries to it, it might actually tickle the brain more than any other part of the body.\"\n\nIf you\u2019re somehow still interested in recontouring your penis, you may have a hard time finding a practitioner outside of the prison system\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem be be something that\u2019s advertised. If, however, you see a guy with devil horns subdermally implanted into his forehead, it would be a safe bet that he knows a guy.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of Tonic delivered to your inbox.", "description": "Google image \"pearling\" at your own risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5b5f4b83d5805b0008b1e79c/lede/1533137315756-GettyImages-975892576.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.846642030848329xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2018-07-30"}
