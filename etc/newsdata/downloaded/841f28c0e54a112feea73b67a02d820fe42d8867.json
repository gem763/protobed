The singles will then push themselves out of their comfort zones in the hope of being swept off their feet, rather than swept to the left or right on a phone.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\n\u201cFlirty Dancing is a truly unique format \u2013 it\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before. It\u2019s fun, fresh and romantic, and broadens the dating format far beyond its traditional boundaries,\u201d said Rob Wade, President, Alternative Entertainment and Specials, Fox Entertainment. \u201cJenna is our dream host. She knows all about how powerful connection and chemistry can be on the dance floor. So there really is no one better to help guide these singles in their search for love.\u201d\n\nIn a twist to the original UK format, the U.S. adaptation will feature singles who will perform a different choreographed dance with each of two potential love interests, before choosing the one with whom he/she has the strongest connection. While the singles may not all be professional dancers, the elevated choreography will tell a story reflective of their personal journeys to find love, while also providing clues to the other\u2019s personality.\n\nFlirty Dancing is produced by Second Star, part of Objective Media Group, and All3Media America. Second Star\u2019s Deborah Sargeant and Objective Media Group America\u2019s Jilly Pearce will serve as executive producers. Mike Yurchuk serves as executive producer and showrunner.\n\nDewan also is set to star in Joshua Safran\u2019s musical drama series Soundtrack set to premiere on Netflix this winter. She is coming off starring roles in The Wedding Year and in the anthology film Berlin, I Love You. She also was featured on Fox\u2019s medical drama, The Resident, and served as host of the competition series World of Dance.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
