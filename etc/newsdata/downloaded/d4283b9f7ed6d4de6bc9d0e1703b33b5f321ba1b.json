Maybe my time has passed.\u2019\u201d Gillian Leithman\n\nMintzer and Leithman, of Boston and Quebec, respectively, believe that too many people in midlife accept employers\u2019 stereotypes that older workers are tired, afraid to learn new things and technologically challenged. These men and women in their 50s and 60s then adopt these behaviors themselves, worsening their chances to get hired or promoted.\n\n\u2018A very bad loop\u2019 for midlife employees\n\n\u201cA very bad loop happens,\u201d Leithman, who teaches leadership development at Concordia University and offers skills training workshops, told the 75 retirement coaches. \u201cIf I [the employer] don\u2019t give you the opportunity to move ahead in your career or give you access to professional development initiatives, you start to believe in a self-fulfilling prophesy: \u2018Maybe I am old and I can\u2019t learn anything new. Maybe my time has passed.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeithman heard exactly those kinds of self-defeating words when she interviewed older workers for her Ph.D.\n\nMintzer, co-author of \u201cThe Couple\u2019s Retirement Puzzle\u201d and founder of Revolutionizeretirement.com, said older workers often have an unconscious, internalized bias that \u201csucks the life out\u201d of them. This feeling then prevents them from asking for promotions or to be assigned to special projects.\n\nAlso see: You\u2019re likely to be out of a job in your 50s \u2014 4 ways to prepare and minimize the pain\n\nInstead, Mintzer and Leithman said \u2014 based on the research they\u2019ve reviewed and conducted \u2014midlife employees need to entertain new possibilities about working beyond age 65 with the three P\u2019s: Presence, Performance and Possibilities.\n\nPresence\n\nPresence, the speakers said, means understanding the \u201cmind/body connection.\u201d\n\nHere, Leithman pointed to the work of social psychologist Amy Cuddy, best known for her self-improvement body language technique of \u201cpower posing.\u201d According to Cuddy (whose research has been questioned by other researchers), standing in a power pose can increase testosterone, decrease cortisol and lead to better job interviews.\n\n\u201cYour body can influence your mind,\u201d said Leithman, acknowledging that Cuddy\u2019s research is \u201csomewhat controversial.\u201d\n\nRelated: Age discrimination is still a major obstacle for older workers\n\nMintzer\u2019s advice to midlife employees: \u201cStand tall and be proud\u201d of who you are and of your life experience because \u201cour body language influences how others think and feel about us and it determines how we think of ourselves.\u201d She urged the retirement coaches to talk about this with their clients because \u201cif you go into a job interview feeling defeated, you will be defeated.\u201d\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance, the speakers said, is about knowing how to \u201cfake it until you become it.\u201d Leithman called this \u201cprobably the most exciting part of our work research.\u201d\n\nHere, she credited Herminia Ibarra, an organizational behavior professor at the London Business School known for her Authenticity Paradox TED Talk and her book, \u201cWorking Identity.\u201d \u201cHer work goes against a lot of things we\u2019ve been taught and conventional wisdom,\u201d said Leithman.\n\nMidlifers considering what they\u2019ll do next are usually told to think about what they want to do. \u201cThe problem is,\u201d said Leithman, \u201cwhen you move into a new arena or a new role, you can\u2019t rely on your old mind-set. Ibarra says: go out and do something. Act your way into a new way of thinking.\u201d\n\nThis is hard to do, Leithman acknowledged, offering an example from her own life.\n\nRead: The good and the bad of Americans working longer, retiring later\n\nShe gives her students a personality assessment tool that tells them what \u201ccolor\u201d they are. The color reflects someone\u2019s personality: For instance, red might mean a goal-oriented power wielder; blue might mean do-gooder. \u201cRed is not who I am or how I work,\u201d said Leithman. But she realized she needed to cater to students, some of whom were Reds.\n\nSo she began teaching like a Red person \u201ceven though it was not natural for me\u201d and at the end of class, asked the students what color they thought she was. They replied: Red.\n\n\u201cI had to act my way into a new way of thinking,\u201d Leithman said.\n\nHer advice for midlife employees: Try new things. Get curious. \u201cYou have to have data to reflect on your new experiences,\u201d said Leithman, even if you\u2019ll have some trial and error.\n\nPossibilities\n\nFinally, possibilities translates to \u201cengage in play.\u201d\n\nSaid Leithman: \u201cTransitions require adoption of a playful mind-set. Play leads to possibilities. And exploration allows space for emotion, intuition, creativity and a leap of faith.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cplay\u201d advice for midlife employees? \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to try new things,\u201d said Leithman. \u201cOverreliance on our strengths means we are not exploring our opportunities.\u201d", "description": "Older employees tend to accept the stereotypes about themselves.
