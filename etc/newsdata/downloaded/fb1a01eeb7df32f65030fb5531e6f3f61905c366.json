The scientists looked into why the communication chain was being disrupted by focusing on the endocannabinoid system in the body. This system is a web of molecules, which, although are still being researched, are believed to play a role in processes such as appetite, pain-sensation, mood, fertility and memory. Studies on rodents found endocannabinoids enhance food intake by influencing the part of the brain that process smells. Some work suggests that endocannabinoids may directly change how neurons work in the paths between the nose and brain. Therefore, the scientists at Northwestern University took participants' blood to look at which endocannabinoid molecules were present. They found levels of a molecule called 2OG were elevated after the night of sleep deprivation. And when sleep-deprived people were given the choice to eat whatever they wanted at the buffet, those with greater levels of 2OG preferred food higher in energy. The authors wrote: 'Taken together, these results suggest that sleep deprivation influences the endocannabinoid system, which in turn alters the connection between piriform and insular cortex, leading to a shift toward foods which are high in calories.'\n\nAfter being sleep deprived, volunteers chose foods that were higher in calories, on average six per cent.\n\nHowever, they did not eat more calories overall.\n\nThe effects were long-lasting, as participants continued to eat calorie-dense foods the following day, despite having a 'recovery' sleep.\n\nThe study is the latest of many to delve into the mechanisms behind why a lack of sleep causes unhealthy food choices.\n\nPrevious research has uncovered a cascade of changes in the body that drive sleep-deprived people to high fat, salt and sugar foods.\n\nMost significantly, hunger regulating hormones such as ghrelin and leptin have been reported to increase.\n\nThe new research, based on 29 men and women between the ages of 18 and 40, was published in the journal eLife.\n\nSenior author Thorsten Kahnt, assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said: 'People who do not get enough sleep often start to favor sweet and fatty foods, which contributes to weight gain.\n\n'Our findings suggest that sleep deprivation makes our brain more susceptible to enticing food smells.'\n\nHe added that it may 'be worth taking a detour to avoid your local doughnut shop next time you catch a 6am flight'.\n\nAll of the participants were given sleep trackers on their wrist to monitor how much shut-eye they got.\n\nOn the night they were deprived of sleep, the volunteers were only allowed to kip between 1am and 5am.\n\nTo keep participants awake, the researchers advised activities such as watching TV and standing up.\n\nIn the second part of the experiment, the participants had MRI scans taken of their brain before the buffet.\n\nThey were then presented with a number of different smells, including the scent of foods such as gingerbread, cinnamon and caramel.\n\nDuring the study, doctors observed their piriform cortex, the first area of the brain that receives information from the nose.\n\nIt sends information to the insular cortex, situated deeper inside the brain, which receives signals about smell, taste, and how much food is in the stomach.\n\nThese factors influence how much food we end up eating, the researchers wrote.\n\nSleep-deprived participants had more activity in the piriform cortex, suggesting they were percieving food smells more than after a normal night's sleep.\n\nBut the insula cortex also showed reduced communication with the piriform cortex, suggesting smells were not being fully understood.\n\nProfessor Thorsten said: 'When you're sleep deprived, these brain areas may not be getting enough information, and you're overcompensating by choosing food with a richer energy signal.\n\n'When the piriform cortex does not properly communicate with the insula, then people start eating more energy-dense food.\n\n'But it may also be that these other areas fail to keep tabs on the sharpened signals in the olfactory cortex. That could also lead to choosing doughnuts and potato chips.'\n\nHOW IS SMELL LINKED TO FOOD CHOICES? Smell is an important characteristic of food and is known to influence food choices - what we decide to eat and how much of it. Even when we are full the sight - which also plays a huge role in what we eat - or smell of a desirable food can stimulate appetite to go in for a second helping. You only need to think of freshly baked bread or pastries to know how appetising odours can be. Exposure to such smells makes our mouths salivate and increases feelings of hunger that may have not been there before. On the other hand, people report to be less hungry after cooking a meal, which is long exposure to smell. The olfactory system may be linked with a person's weight, considering studies have suggested exposure to a desirable savory smell increases reactivity to foods, leading to a general desire to eat. This means that, for some, people are driven to snack more than others, because food odour is a powerful stimulus for their appetite. But people respond differently to the food in their environment.", "description": "A study by Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine suggests food smells stronger to people who are lacking sleep.
