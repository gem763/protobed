Aramco\u2019s crude oil inventories are more than 60 million barrels, he said.\n\nSpeaking at the same news conference, Aramco\u2019s Chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, said Aramco\u2019s IPO would be ready within the coming 12 months and that the kingdom was committed to the listing.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nRumayyan said the IPO would \u201ccontinue as it is\u201d despite weekend attacks and that timing would depend on market conditions.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz said Riyadh did not yet know who carried out the strikes or why, adding Saudi Arabia would keep its role as a secure supplier of global markets. He said stricter measures needed to be taken to prevent further attacks, but did not elaborate.\n\nThe foreign ministry has said that preliminary investigations indicated Iranian weapons were used in the assault, which authorities initially said involved drones.", "description": "Saudi Arabia will restore its lost oil production by the end of September and has managed to recover supplies to customers to the levels they were at prior to weekend attacks on its facilities by drawing from its huge oil inventories.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430996660&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1JU", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
