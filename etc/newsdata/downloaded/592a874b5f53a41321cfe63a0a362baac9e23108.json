So, I slipped the $1 in her pocket. She then slipped the dollar in my backpack and so began the back and forth with the $1 bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We found silly ways to give it back and forth. I mailed it to her house. She stuffed it in a gum wrapper and offered me a piece.\n\n\u2018I then decided that I would ask her out on this $1.\n\n\u2018I wrote, \u201cWill you go out with me\u201d on it and put it in a note and gave it to her. She said yes (of course, it would be a terrible story otherwise, I suppose).\u2019\n\nThis adorable love story doesn\u2019t just end with two high school sweethearts.\n\nJason and his partner continued their romance well into adulthood.\n\nOf course, the dollar then became a sentimental piece of their history. So, four years later, when Jason wanted to get down on one knee, he had to bring out the dollar.\n\nHe said: \u2018I still had the same dollar kept away. On our anniversary, I wrote \u201cWill you marry me\u201d on the bottom of the dollar.\n\n\u2018We have been married for 15 years and have three awesome kids. We still have that dollar stored away.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s framed somewhere.\n\nMORE: A mum\u2019s heartwarming message about helping other mothers has gone viral\n\nMORE: Girl\u2019s heartwarming love story is a reminder to always shoot your shot\n\nMORE: Woman shares how she transformed her carpeted staircase with just \u00a350 worth of products\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "For American Reddit user Jason W, the small note gave him everything he is grateful for in life - his wife and kids.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88804954_1570449217.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
