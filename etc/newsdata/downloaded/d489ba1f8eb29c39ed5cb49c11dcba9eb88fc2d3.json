Bad! Oh but so good, talk about a Tango with a killer bite, almost hypnotic power and intention.\n\n'The staccato was razor sharp, the dance the choreography my darling was superb. You made a mistake in the link there, otherwise it was one of the most memorising tangos I've ever seen. The Prince of Darkness is the Prince of Tango.'\n\nWithout the error it seemed likely that Kelvin and Oti would have scored higher, but regardless they still earned 36 points out of 40.\n\nThe pair will be dancing the Viennese waltz to Say Something by A Great Big World and Christina Aguilera in this week's show.", "description": "Oti Mabuse revealed she had a sour moment backstage during the live show on Saturday, which was hilariously captured in a surprise photo.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20382978-0-image-a-12_1572450575636.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
