We're still reeling from back-to-school madness and working big sweaters back into our wardrobe and then suddenly \u2014 it's time to take on turkey. While some seasoned hosts may have already ordered their bird and consulted our handy guide to help plan the rest of the meal, if you're behind on your feast prep or are simply looking for an alternative to a stressful day of cooking, we feel you. And we may just have the solution you've been waiting for.\n\nFlipping through Ricardo Larriv\u00e9e's new cookbook Ricardo: Ultimate Slow Cooker earlier this fall, and seeing recipes for dishes we never dreamed could be made in such a way (read: scalloped potatoes), gave us a radical idea: why not turn your slow cooker into your sous chef this Thanksgiving? Not only will a strategy like this free up coveted oven space at a time when it's needed most, getting to dump all your ingredients and have them cook to perfection without much maintenance will give you the opportunity to take a breather, focus on the parts of the meal you really enjoy making and spend more time with the friends and family who make this holiday what it is.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the recipes you need to tackle Thanksgiving with your slow cooker this year:\n\nThe main: Turkey Roast with Cranberries\n\n(Credit: Christian Lacroix)\n\nThis two-in-one, no-basting-required recipe is a fuss-free solution for anyone who doesn't want to bother with the full bird this year.\n\nThe side: Scalloped Potatoes\n\n(Credit: Christian Lacroix)\n\nNow that we know one of our most-loved sides can be prepared in such a way, there's no going back \u2014 at least when a big feast is on the line, and oven space is scarce.\n\nThe dessert: Maple Syrup Dumplings\n\n(Credit: Christian Lacroix)\n\nThese doughy delights come together so easily and boast all the best autumnal flavours, that they have us rearranging our dumpling hierarchy to include them. Serve with vanilla ice cream as an alternative to pie this holiday.\n\nNow that you've got some oven space (and prep time!) freed up, here are a few complementary dishes that will help fill out your menu:\n\nA Really Good Kale Salad\n\nThe Perfect Stuffing\n\nMaple Glazed Squash and Carrots\n\nCreamy Braised Savoy Cabbage\n\nMake-Ahead Roasted Sweet Potatoes\n\nHalf Made Home-Made Pumpkin Ice Cream Pie\n\nBelinda's Flourless Coconut and Chocolate Cake", "description": "From the bird to the dessert, Ricardo\u2019s got recipes that\u2019ll revolutionize your meal prep this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4847700.1538509817!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/slow-cooker-thanksgiving.png"}
