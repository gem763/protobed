If the project went ahead the building work would begin in 2022 and take up to six years\n\nNetwork Rail said the plans were the best possible solution to preserve the line that connects Devon and Cornwall to the rest of the country.\n\nRuth Ward from the Save Holcombe Beach campaign said there must be alternatives to destroying 'such a beautiful beach'.\n\n'Surely in this day and age we know the sea is rising and moving it out to sea is going to make the problem worse.'\n\nIn 2014 storm damage cost the local economy \u00a31billion as a result of the six-week closure of the line according to a spokesman for Network Rail.\n\nThe rail line runs directly alongside the popular red sand beach (pictured) which is adored by residents and families\n\nHe said: 'Leaving it is not an option.\n\n'Changing our plans to potentially re-grade the cliff would mean we would have to close the railway line.\n\n'It would have a massive impact on the peninsula, all the way down through Devon and into Cornwall.'\n\nRuth Ward from the Save Holcombe Beach campaign said there must be alternatives to destroying 'such a beautiful beach'\n\nNetwork Rail said the plans were not final and further consultation would be held\n\nNetwork Rail said the plans were not final and further consultation would be held.\n\nIf the project went ahead the building work would begin in 2022 and take up to six years.\n\nThe proposals have been part of a broader series of plans by the company to safeguard the line.\n\nThese included the expansion of the sea wall which began at Dawlish in June following a major collapse and destruction of the rail line in February 2014.\n\nThat project was expected to be completed in January 2020 at a cost of \u00a330million.", "description": "Campaigners have claimed the plan would involve the destruction of more than half of Holcombe beach near Teignmouth, Devon.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19697346-0-image-a-107_1571064219307.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
