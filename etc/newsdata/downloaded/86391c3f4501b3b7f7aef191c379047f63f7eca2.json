As soon as weather conditions are deemed safe enough, Tropic Ocean Airways will deploy its fleet from Fort Lauderdale International Airport to assess the damage from a bird's eye view. The airline has teamed up with the Bahamian government and a group of former Navy SEALS called \"Blue Tide Marine\" to deliver vital medical support to the islands along with food and water.
