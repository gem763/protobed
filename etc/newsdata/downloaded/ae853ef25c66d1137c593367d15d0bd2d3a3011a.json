Time to up the prize money | Suzanne Wrack", "language": "en", "text": "The announcement that viewing figures for the Women\u2019s World Cup hit 1.12 billion is hugely impressive and raises vital questions about how we measure the success of the women\u2019s game versus the men\u2019s.\n\nMatildas captain Sam Kerr again in hunt for women's Ballon d'Or Read more\n\nIf you put to one side the massive exception of the USA women\u2019s national team generating more income than their male counterparts yet being paid less (which hints at this being more ideological than financial), then the argument against equal World Cup prize money and funding is that, generally, the men\u2019s game generates more income that the women\u2019s. Except this is never quantified. Because sponsorship rights and broadcast rights (which make up the majority of money generated) for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s premier competitions are bundled and sold together, it is impossible.\n\nThe assumption is that these big-money deals are sold overwhelmingly on the basis of the men\u2019s World Cup. But this can only ever be an assumption when rights are bundled together. (Uefa, meanwhile, has unbundled the rights for their women\u2019s competitions for the European Championship and Champions League.)\n\nHowever, if you look at the $30m (\u00a323m) prize pot for the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup (double what it was for the 2015 edition) and the $400m prize pot for the 2018 men\u2019s World Cup, it is clear that we are putting separate values on the two competitions. Somewhere it has been decided that the women\u2019s tournament is worth 7.5% of the men\u2019s.\n\nSomewhere it has been decided that the Women\u2019s World Cup is worth 7.5% of the men\u2019s\n\nWhy begin with the 1.12 billion viewers of the Women\u2019s World Cup in this context? Because it offers a concrete measurement of the interest in the women\u2019s competition that we can compare to the men\u2019s. The 2018 men\u2019s World Cup pulled in a huge 3.572 billion viewers. The figure for the Women\u2019s World Cup is 31% of the number that watched the men\u2019s.\n\nSo, in the absence of unbundled rights, why do we not use that figure to determine the women\u2019s share? Why do we instead get another token \u201cdoubling\u201d of the prize pot or investments when the numbers are so low?\n\nThe announcement that the women\u2019s prize pot will double again to $60m for the 2023 tournament makes for an impressive headline in isolation, evidence that Fifa does indeed care, until you read that the men\u2019s is increasing by $10m more than that, to $440m, in time for the Qatar World Cup.\n\nWhen Megan Rapinoe was asked ahead of the USA\u2019s semi-final against England whether she felt, as a campaigner, that they were making a material difference given the mid-tournament raft of Fifa announcements \u2013 among them a further doubling of the prize fund and a $500m investment in women\u2019s football (since upped to $1bn) \u2013 she was dismissive.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cDouble it now and use that number to double it or quadruple it for the next time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is what I mean when we talk about whether we feel respected.\n\n\u201cIf you really care about game in the same way, why are you letting the gap grow? We\u2019re not asking for \u00a3450m for lots of different reasons \u2013 the men\u2019s game is far more advanced financially than the women\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nWhile there was undoubtedly a huge amount of respect for Rapinoe, this also prompted the view that Rapinoe was simply being radical for the sake of it, that laying into Fifa as big money was being poured in was misjudged or misplaced.\n\nExcept in the above context, her comments are transformed. If anything, they are relatively conservative and very considered. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to have an incredible business running it on a budget of a dollar more than last year,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to bet on the future of the women\u2019s game and it has proved World Cup after World Cup, year after year that we are worthy of investment and the quality on field is there and we need the business step to be in line with the steps we are making in performing on the field.\u201d\n\nSeven Liverpool players on Ballon D'Or shortlist, Bronze and White nominated Read more\n\nIf we take even the viewing figures as a loose guidance for prize monies and investments then 31.4% of the men\u2019s $400m prize pot would come to $125m \u2013 more than four times what was actually available in France. But that should be the minimum, first because, as Rapinoe said, a business requires investment in order to grow and, perhaps more significantly and importantly, because Fifa is a not-for-profit organisation. Regardless of the numbers it should be looking to use its huge influence and record $2.7bn in reserves to the benefit of the entirety of the population, not just half of it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aoife Mannion (right) injured a knee ligament against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.

Mannion joined City from Birmingham in the summer and received her first England call-up for the friendlies against Norway and Belgium in August.\n\n\u2022 Lionesses Lucy Bronze and Ellen White have been named on the 20-player Ballon d\u2019Or shortlist, having played key roles in England\u2019s charge to the semi-final of the Women\u2019s World Cup. Four members of the World Cup-winning US Women\u2019s National Team are listed, including golden boot and golden ball winner Megan Rapinoe. Last year\u2019s inaugural winner, Ada Hegerberg, is also on the list of nominees having scored a 16-minute hat-trick in the Champions League final.\n\n\u2022 The first ever Lisbon derby between Benfica and Sporting was played at the Est\u00e1dio do Sport Lisbon on 19 October with more than 12,000 in attendance. Benfica took the lead through the Brazilian forward Nycole Raysla before two from her compatriot Darlene put the result beyond doubt.\n\n\u2022 NWSL Shield winners North Carolina Courage ensured a place in the Championship play-off final for the third consecutive season with a 4-1 defeat of Reign FC in extra time. A Heather O\u2019Reilly penalty in the 88th minute looked to have given NCC victory before an injury-time strike from Ifeoma Onumonu sent the game to extra time. A goal from Debinha, a Lauren Barnes own goal and one from the former Chelsea player Crystal Dunn sealed the win for NCC. Meanwhile, Sam Kerr took her season tally to 19 goals as Chicago Red Stars beat Portland Thorns to put them into the final against NCC on 27 October.", "description": "World Cup viewing figures debunk the myth that interest in the men\u2019s game dwarfs the women\u2019s.
