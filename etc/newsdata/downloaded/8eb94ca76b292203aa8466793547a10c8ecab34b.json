In Chicago, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has bluntly said that it isn\u2019t. Paying Beijing an unwanted compliment, he says that China is a \u201cnewly developed\u201d economy and no longer needs the help of special trading concessions at the World Trade Organisation. Alleged gaming of these privileges creates special ire among Americans carrying huge trade deficits. Mr Morrison believes it would be better for everyone if they were just negotiated away in new reforms of the WTO.\n\nScott Morrison would like to see WTO rules reformed, not thrown out altogether. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nBut these advantages are more symbolic than decisive. China has been quite unlike the export-led economic miracles that preceded it, such as Japan or South Korea. It is far bigger, and with 1.2 billion people the difference between its leading edge of ritzy cities and its trailing edge in the countryside is still huge. Urbanisation is happening far more slowly, and democratisation not at all. In this respect, China is still a developing nation. But it has imposed a huge Communist Party-run, debt-driven mercantilist economic model onto the rest of the world, which has struggled to accommodate it. That has led to hollowing of the industrial West and destabilising global macro-economic imbalances, with political consequences that are driving the US trade war. Like other Asian nations, China has also challenged the West on technology. But Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are not authoritarian states, nor do they have hegemonic ambitions with a military edge.\n\nAustralia has done uniquely well as a complementary resources exporter to China. There would be no issue if China\u2019s vast market was just as open to other Western products. But for most of the past four decades, China has exported like a capitalist and imported like a communist, handing the commanding heights of its economy to subsidised state-owned giants, and import-substituting as soon as it can. Early US Sino-optimists thought that China would liberalise as it got richer. Politically, that was never realistic. But US hawks now believe that because China has not done so, at least with its economy, it must therefore be an enemy. But that\u2019s an overreaction too. Trying to contain China as a threat will simply see it try racing ahead with self-sufficiency in technology. Unlike the other Asian exporters, China is big enough to form a bloc of its own if the Americans try to exclude it from theirs.\n\nMr Morrison criticises the WTO rules alongside the US. But that is because unlike what Donald Trump seems to be saying, he wants to keep and reform them, not throw them out. Another round of global trade deals that recognises the new realities that Mr Morrison talks about is the only good way out of this.", "description": "China is indeed a special economic case -- but it should not be treated as one by the WTO", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2218%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_85/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f8ab2ad9e969608908eb72bfa4f45c70a04e42ee", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
