Police were called to the Marine Terrace area after receiving reports of a car driving erratically\n\nOne of the group is seen sprinting across the car's path with some kind of weapon in his hand while another stands in the road and others loiter nearby\n\nA video of the incident has emerged which shows the car driving along the road before forming a figure of eight around parked cars. It snakes across the pavement which is lined with parked cars.\n\nWhile the vehicle narrowly missing other cars, people quickly dash to hide behind other ones as the rogue driver moves in an unpredictable way.\n\nMoments later, there appears to be a scuffle with a few men who seem to be trying to get into the car.\n\nOne of them is seen holding a weapon-like object similar to a piece of wood and thumps another person with it.\n\nA man has been left with 'minor injuries' after the reckless driver stormed the pavement this morning\n\nThe vehicle reverses for a brief moment before a couple of the men jump in with the door wide open. They then speed off.\n\nAnyone who witnessed the incident or has any information is asked to contact Dyfed-Powys Police.
