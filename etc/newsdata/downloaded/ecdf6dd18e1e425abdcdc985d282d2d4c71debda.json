If insurers underprice these risks, it could threaten their viability in the event of extreme weather events resulting in very large losses.\"\n\nOn the other hand, it said overpricing the risk would \"impede the risk pooling function provided by insurance and unduly limit economic activity\".\n\n\"Even if correctly priced, more of these [climate change] risks may become uninsurable, forcing households, businesses or governments to bear this risk,\" the RBA warns.

Transition risk could also arise if large investment in technologies allowed new entrants to displace established but emissions-intensive practices, or if consumer preferences shifted rapidly towards \u2018green\u2019 products,\" it read.\n\nDirectors would face legal risk if they failed to address the potential exposure of their firms to climate-related risks, the paper warns, referring to the Hutley opinion, in which Sydney SC Noel Hutley, and barrister Sebastian Hartford Davis, concluded there were \"significant and well publicised risks associated with climate change and global warming that would be regarded by a court as foreseeable\".\n\nClimate risk was \"not yet a significant threat to financial stability in Australia\", the RBA said, though adding it was \"becoming increasingly important for investors and institutions to take account of and manage these risks\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt warned of the inherent uncertainty of these risks, compounded by the \"significant\" lack of data available to assess them\n\n\"To manage their own direct exposure to physical risk, insurers and banks need granular information on the location and physical risks faced by the assets they insure or the collateral they lend against,\" the report says.\n\n\"But they also need to consider their indirect exposure to firms or individuals that may be exposed to climate risk, which is challenging because of firms' incomplete or inconsistent climate-related financial risk disclosure.\"\n\nThe RBA gave favourable mention to the international private-sector led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and also mentioned the work done on climate risk by its fellow financial regulators, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\n\nIt also said it was \"involved in international efforts to improve regulators' understanding of the implications of climate change for the financial sector\", including through the Network for Greening the Financial System, a group of central banks and supervisors.", "description": "The Reserve Bank of Australia warns changing weather patterns could lead to some risks becoming uninsurable in a climate-change risk report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4985%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_259/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0d3bb5c6b16f565e960f6bc8ed05dd830ec43ee4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
