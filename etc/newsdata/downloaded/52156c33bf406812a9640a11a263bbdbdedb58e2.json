This would have been simple to do so; it would have caused less work, cost less money, and provided the Foundation a lot less stress. But it also would be wrong,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"Agreeing to this would leave this patent live, and allow this to be used as a weapon against countless others. We will stand firm against this baseless attack, not just for GNOME and Shotwell, but for all free and open source software projects.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the owner of RPI, Leigh Rothschild, has filed lawsuits against other tech companies. According to Ars Technica, a separate entity owned by Rothschild, called Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations (RCDI), raised a lawsuit in 2017 against GPS tech company Garmin for infringing a patent.\n\nRCDI eventually dropped the lawsuit, and shortly after, Garmin filed a counterclaim against the company for $20,000 as compensation for the legal fees it accrued during the court proceedings.\n\nOne of the principal ways of overcoming patent lawsuits is to attempt to find prior works that are more relevant to patentability of the claims.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nGNOME faces 'baseless' patent lawsuit for organising images\n\nThe patent is for a system and method for distributing digital photographic images.\n\nSupreme Court puts new restriction on patent trolls\n\nThe high court unanimously curbs the use of \"forum shopping,\" limiting patent litigation to the judicial district where the defendant is incorporated.\n\nMicrosoft to aid Azure customers in taking on patent trolls\n\nMicrosoft's new Azure IP Advantage program is providing Microsoft cloud users with access to 10,000 Microsoft patents to help them fight 'baseless patent lawsuits.'\n\nGoogle holds patent giveaway for startups to ward off trolls\n\nGoogle wants to give two patent families to 50 startups to bolster a tech industry led anti-troll network.\n\nFujifilm announces first 30TB LTO-8 tapes following patent settlement, import ban (TechRepublic)\n\nDemand for tape backup remains strong, though sales were halted due to a recently settled patent dispute.", "description": "The foundation will fight the patent lawsuit.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/22/2e0b06ae-f171-4bf5-9faf-92c31e31da5e/thumbnail/770x578/48ccc1f00214d3f19327104485805dad/org-gnome-shotwell.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
