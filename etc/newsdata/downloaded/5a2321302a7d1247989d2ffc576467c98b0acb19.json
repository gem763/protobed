Now, USWNT star Carli Lloyd is doing the same thing on a different playing field.\n\nLast week, the two-time World Cup Champion, 2015 and 2016 FIFA Player of the Year, and noted Philadelphia Eagles fan successfully kicked a 55-yard field goal at an Eagles practice. The feat was captured on video, and quickly went viral.\n\nSince then, ESPN reports that multiple NFL teams have reached out to Lloyd. One even invited her to participate in a preseason game, but she declined because she\u2019s playing in a game with the USWNT on the same day. However, she\u2019s taking the possibility seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am having discussions with my husband and (trainer) about the reality of playing in the NFL,\u201d Lloyd told Fox Sports. \u201cThey both feel that I could do it and should consider it. So I\u2019m seriously considering it, as it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nSome have dismissed this as a publicity stunt, or some sort of sideshow distraction. NFL wide receiver Keenan Allen has dismissed her chances of ever making a roster, tweeting that if one of Lloyd\u2019s kicks were ever to get blocked and she suddenly were playing defense, it would look like \u201cthe stampede scene in the lion king (sic) movie.\u201d\n\nBut critics sell Lloyd short. And, as her opponents of the past two decades know all too well, selling Carli Lloyd short is a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nFirst of all, Lloyd is not going to do anything unless she\u2019s fully prepared for it. So, while she is considering the NFL an option, she\u2019s not thinking about this season. Instead, she\u2019s going to put in the work, see if she is able to adjust her technique to fit the rules that placekickers in the NFL must follow, and decide if this is a realistic path to pursue. If she still feels confident, she is going to try to make it happen for the 2020 season, not the 2019 season, which begins in less than two weeks.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s going to do this, she\u2019ll do it \u2014 she\u2019ll train in the offseason, she\u2019ll get herself ready so that she just doesn\u2019t do it for the sake of doing it,\u201d her trainer, James Galanis, told ESPN. \u201cIf she\u2019s going to do it, she\u2019s going to do it so that she can be a success.\u201d\n\nShe is, after all, a professional who takes her reputation incredibly seriously.\n\nSecondly, Lloyd would not be the first female to be a placekicker in a male-dominated football game. Women have served as placekickers in football games on the high school, collegiate, and semi-professional levels. Not surprisingly, many of these women excelled at soccer, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1997, Liz Heaston was the first woman to play and score in a college football game, when she kicked two extra points for Willamette University. She played in only two games, although she did have an extended career as a soccer player for Willamette.\n\nIn 2003, Tonya Butler \u2014 a standout placekicker in high school who also played soccer in college \u2014 became the first woman to score a field goal in a college football game, when she played for the University of West Alabama Tigers, a Division II school in the NCAA. That same year, University of New Mexico\u2019s Katie Hnida became the first woman to play in a Division I-A bowl, when she attempted an extra point. In 2018, placekicker Becca Longo became the first woman to receive a scholarship out of high school to play for a Division II NCAA football team.\n\nYes, those examples all come from lower levels of the sport. But they also involved athletes who are not nearly as skilled as Lloyd. She\u2019s not a high school soccer star; she\u2019s a two-time world champion phenom. So, it makes sense that she would have a chance to break through at a more advanced level.\n\nAnd really, that\u2019s the crux of it: Lloyd\u2019s elite athleticism and championship experience set her apart from the field. Yes, NFL kickers are under an immense amount of scrutiny, but Lloyd has participated in shoot-outs in the World Cup, so she\u2019s proven her mental strength. Yes, Lloyd would need to change her technique in order to follow NFL guidelines, but she has the work ethic, self discipline, and access to training to do just that. And sure, when a kick breaks down and all the huge men come running towards her, she\u2019s not the most likely candidate to make a tackle. But kickers never are. That\u2019s not why they\u2019re on the roster. Lloyd plays a physical sport and isn\u2019t afraid of contact, and in the NFL, at least she would be wearing pads and a helmet.\n\nUltimately, there are plenty of reasons to question whether Lloyd should play in the NFL, because there are plenty of reasons to question whether anyone of any gender should play in the NFL given the dangers it presents. It\u2019s okay to feel a bit uncomfortable about a woman suiting up in an NFL game, and potentially being tackled by a bunch of men. And it\u2019s reasonable to feel a bit skeptical about whether anything will ever come from this discussion \u2014 after all, Lloyd is still a soccer player, and might not find it worth her time to pursue this.\n\nBut Lloyd knows that if she does, she won\u2019t be just kicking for herself; she\u2019ll be representing women everywhere who are trying to break through barriers and crack glass ceilings. She\u2019ll be kicking to help us all open our minds and reassess the limitations we put on women. As we know from her soccer career, that is not a responsibility she takes lightly. There\u2019s no reason to expect this would be any different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go in there blindly,\u201d Lloyd told NBCSports Philadelphia. \u201cI want to actually attempt to do it. But I know that I definitely could do it, because anything I set my mind to do, I can do it. And I actually do kick balls for a living.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1150336590.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
