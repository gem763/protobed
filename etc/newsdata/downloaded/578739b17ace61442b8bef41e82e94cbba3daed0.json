Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence, and sometimes begins after an infection or illness. It is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 20 hours a day. Episodes can come on very quickly and last between a few days to a few weeks. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. Patients return to normal between episodes, however they may become depressed as a consequence of the condition. Around 1,000 people worldwide suffer from the disorder, which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. Two-thirds of sufferers are male. There is no known cure for the sleeping disorder, and the main treatment is watchful waiting at home by loved ones. Research suggests episodes decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of 8 to 12 weeks.\n\nNow Beth and her family need to raise \u00a3100,000 so she can have life-saving surgery, without which, her condition will only get worse.\n\nShe has already had at least one mini stroke and now says she is bed bound most of the time due to the condition.\n\n\"Because it's your brain it's not just a case of 'I'll sit in bed'. It's hard to even talk to your friends.\n\n\"And because there's lots of arteries that go to the brain, because my neck moves too much, it can press and trap the arteries. It can stop the blood going to the brain.\"\n\nBeth was very sporty as a teenager before she fell ill with KLS, and had a lot of muscle mass, which Janine thinks helped to 'hold her body together' and mask the fact she had EDS.\n\nBut spending long periods confined to bed had caused Beth's muscles to deteriorate, and as a result the EDS is now having a catastrophic impact on her health.\n\nIn the past, when she wasn't having a KLS episode, Beth was able to carry on with life as normal, and could go to the gym and see her friends.\n\nBut over the past 12 months, her health has deteriorated so much because of EDS that she now has to rely on a wheelchair, can't sit up for long, is in severe pain every day and rarely leaves the house.\n\nHer mother Janine said that it\u2019s affected her a lot and that the most serious part is what\u2019s happening with her spine.\n\nBeth now struggles to get out at all. She is pictured above out at the beach on a specially made chair\n\nWHAT IS EHLERS -DANLOS SYNDROME? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is the name for a group of rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissue. Research statistics of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes show the total prevalence as 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 5,000 people, according to charities. There are thirteen individual genetic conditions, all of which affect the body\u2019s connective tissue. Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. Depending on the type of EDS, the faulty gene may have been inherited from one parent, or both parents. Sometimes the faulty gene isn\u2019t inherited, but occurs in the person for the first time. EDS can affect people in different ways. For some the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling. Some of the rare severe types can be life-threatening. There are several types of EDS that may share some symptoms. These include an increased range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), stretchy skin and fragile skin that breaks or bruises easily.

She could live as normal a life as possible.\n\n\"Now, especially in the past year, she has just deteriorated. It's actually unbelievable the person she was, her life, to what it is now.\n\n\"She not often out of bed. During episodes, she's in bed anyway, but even now, outside of episodes she's in bed.\"\n\nBeth urgently needs life-saving surgery to fuse her spine, and without it, her condition will only continue to deteriorate, putting her life at risk.\n\nBecause carrying out surgery on people with EDS can be extremely complicated, the family has struggled to find a surgeon in the UK who is able to do it.\n\nInstead, they are now facing the mammoth task of raising \u00a3100,000, so Beth can go to Spain to be treated by a neurosurgeon who specialises in the condition.\n\nNow Beth says she hasn\u2019t got a choice with the surgery and that she is \u2018scared\u2019 that her condition will create irreversible damage.\n\n\"If I have a stroke and survive it, that could do damage that's irreversible forever.\u2019\n\nHer mother added that it\u2019s vital her daughter has the surgery as soon as possible as the deterioration can be terrible.\n\n\u2018We don't like to think about where that might end. We know her brain is sagging. We know she could wake up one morning and find she's had a stroke.\n\n\"At the moment it's just a huge amount of money to raise and we don't know how it's going to be achieved.\u2019\n\nBeth added that there will be times when she doesn\u2019t go downstairs for a week or outside for a month.\n\n\"Even if I don't have a stroke, the life I have now, I'm not living. I can't just live a normal life. I'm alive but not living\".", "description": "Beth Goodier, from Manchester, has been living with the 'Sleeping Beauty' syndrome since she was 17-years-old and has now been diagnosed with another debilitating condition.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20255666-0-image-a-79_1572210475993.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
