Vettel only just beats Verstappen, though! 0.001s in it. I think Vettel had used tyres, though, so there are a few tenths out there for the German. Behind the top five it's incredibly close. From Gasly in P6 to P10 is just 0.050s. And in P14 it's only another 0.250s. Nip and tuck.\n\n1:36PM\n\nQ2 - Hamilton quickest in S1\n\nBut not by a great deal, to be honest. Just 0.003 over Verstappen. Verstappen on the soft compound, though. Hamilton continues the good pace towards the end of his lap and goes quickest by 0.147 over Bottas. Verstappen beats them all and sits top by just 0.042s. So that's encouraging for Mercedes in some way. Ferrari are about to blow them all out of the water, though...\n\n1:34PM\n\nQ2 - Ferrari go for soft tyres\n\nMercedes with the mediums. Have they written off getting pole and are going for a more optimal strategy in the race? It's a bit tricky for Mercedes now. Really, they need one of their cars in front of one of Ferraris. That would give them options. The top 10 in Q2 start the race on the tyres they set their fastest lap on.\n\n1:32PM\n\nQ2 begins!\n\n15 minutes to go.\n\n1:31PM\n\nQ1 - Top 10\n\nVET\n\nHAM\n\nVER\n\nBOT\n\nLEC\n\nMAG\n\nRIC\n\nSAI\n\nNOR\n\nHUL\n\nStory continues\n\nAs ever, we haven't really learned too much about the top teams in Q1 but Ferrari still look the quickest here. McLaren, Renault and Haas all looking in decent shape and also very close. Just around 0.350 between Magnussen in P6 and Grosjean in P11.\n\nKevin Magnussen finished P6 in Q1 Credit: Getty Images\n\n1:28PM\n\nQ1 - Drivers eliminated\n\n16. RAI\n\n17. RUS\n\n18. KUB\n\n19. ALB\n\n20. KVY\n\nRaikkonen made a mess of his lap at the end there. He wasn't happy about it. Albon crashed out, Kvyat never got out. That's good for Giovinazzi, who has put in a few good performances of late. Will it be enough to secure his seat for 2020? Surely.\n\n1:27PM\n\nQ1 - Final runs underway\n\nNorris improves to P7, Grosjean P10, Magnussen P6, Gasly gets himself out of the drop zone but Russell doesn't and can only go P17. Lance Stroll gets into Q2! Surely. What a miracle!\n\nBottas improves but without a particularly great lap. He's now in P4. Giovinazzi needs to find some time and he does, knocking Raikkonen out! Ricciardo the last man over the line and improves to go P7.\n\n1:24PM\n\nQ1 - Vettel goes top by 0.191s\n\nThat's over Hamilton. Vettel was, sensibly, on the soft tyres there. No point risking it and that set of mediums would have been pretty worn after all those aborted laps. Mercedes out again.\n\nWho's in trouble? Gasly, Russell, Kubica are the three drivers in the drop zone alongside Albon and Kvyat who are both out. Giovinazzi, Stroll, Raikkonen, Perez and Grosjean might be vulnerable but there's a fairly big gap from P14-P16 at the moment.\n\n1:22PM\n\nQ1 -Vettel starts his flying lap\n\nAnd he needs to get it in. He's got the track to himself, basically, which means he's the only one who can mess this lap up. He's quickest in the first sector by about a tenth. He does his best sector in S2 and without any error he'll be going into the top two and comfortably through to Q2.\n\n1:19PM\n\nQ1 - Session restarts\n\nVettel needs another lap to get through. That'll happen comfortably but another yellow flag, red flag or mistake could mean he's in trouble. The Ferrari is sent out to wait at the end of the pit lane before the lights turn green. That's what they do very shortly and we have 6.38 left of the clock.\n\n1:17PM\n\nQ1 - Top 10\n\nHAM\n\nVER +0.138\n\nLEC* +0.383\n\nBOT +0.496\n\nMAG +0.955\n\nHUL +1.006\n\nSAI +1.204\n\nNOR +1.315\n\nRIC +1.335\n\nGRO 1.421\n\n*time set on medium compound tyres.\n\n1:16PM\n\nQ1 - Albon out of the car now\n\nThat crash meant Vettel had to abort his attempted THIRD hot lap. He's currently in the danger zone along with, Russell, Kubica, Albon and Kvyat, who will not take part in this session.\n\nRed Bull said the fight for the final seat is between Albon and Gasly. I am not sure this is a sensible tactic to limit it to one driver who they dropped before the season was over and another with question marks hanging over his ability to perform at the front. Don't get me wrong, I rate Alex Albon but to be put into a Red Bull seat just 11 or 12 races into your F1 career, alongside Max Verstappen is tough.\n\n1:13PM\n\nQ1 - RED FLAG!\n\nAlbon in the wall!\n\nRED FLAG\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nAlex Albon goes off at Turn 13 and into the wall\n\n\n\nHis session is over - and the clock is stopped at 6:38#RussianGP \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd #F1pic.twitter.com/YNzGn90V9V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) September 28, 2019\n\nHe went in too hot and lost the rear. That could be a costly crash. He's had a poor weekend so far and this is not what he needed given he's fighting for the second Red Bull seat. He's a bit slow getting out of the car as well, the medical team are on the scene.\n\n1:10PM\n\nQ1 - Hamilton goes quickest\n\nBy 0.138 from Max Verstappen. Both on the soft tyres. Leclerc 0.4s down or so but on the mediums. So Ferrari still looking strong here. Kvyat yet to come out after that late engine change but I am not sure it's really worth him coming out at all, really, given he's starting from the back. It's his home grand prix, though, so he's probably keen.\n\nOh, no, he won't be coming out at all. Shame.\n\nConfirmation from Toro Rosso that Dany Kvyat won't play any part in qualifying today\n\n\n\nHis car is still being worked on in the garage \ufffd\ufffd\u200d\ufffd\ufffd#RussianGP \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd #F1pic.twitter.com/qJ02auhdUb\n\n\n\n\u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) September 28, 2019\n\n1:09PM\n\nQ1 - Yellow flags\n\nRobert Kubica has spun and he causes Vettel and Albon to abort their laps. Albon wasn't on a brilliant one but it should have been decent enough to get him through to Q1, maybe. Vettel has used a lot of his rubber up as he messed up his first hot lap, did a cooldown lap and then had to abort his second hot lap.\n\n1:07PM\n\nQ1 - Current standings after eight minutes\n\nLEC\n\nMAG\n\nSAI\n\nNOR\n\nGRO\n\nPER\n\nRA\n\nSTR\n\nGIO\n\nGAS\n\nRUS\n\nKUB\n\nVET\n\nEveryone else yet to set a time. Vettel hasn't really set a representative one, either.\n\n1:05PM\n\nQ1 - Leclerc quick\n\nHe's a tenth or so up on Vettel in sector one. Ooh, Vettel is running well but he has to abort his lap as he locks up, runs wide and has to struggle to keep it out of the wall. That'll need another lap. Leclerc, meanwhile, is flying and sets a 1.33.613, which is currently 1.227s than the next quickest man, the one he replaced at Ferrari; Kimi Raikkonen. Looks like Vettel is having a cooldown lap, then he might have another go on the same set of tyres.\n\nSainz pops up into P2, 0.821s behind Leclerc.\n\n1:02PM\n\nQ1 - 16 minutes to go\n\nBoth Ferraris out on the medium tyres as they often do. George Russell is about to go quickest but how long will that last? There's a chance of him getting out of Q1, given the penalties other drivers face; they may not be too bothered about setting quick times in the first session.\n\n1:00PM\n\nQ1 begins!\n\n18 minutes to go. George Russell the first man out.\n\n12:58PM\n\nHonestly, some of the country facts they give you on the TV coverage\n\nAre weird. Did you know Russia is the world's largest country?!! Seriously. Anyway, enough about that. Qualifying is about to begin. It looks a big ask for Mercedes today but they need to maximise their grid position as their race pace could leave them in good shape on Sunday.\n\n12:55PM\n\nIt's a real shame that Ferrari weren't this competitive early in the season\n\nAfter Singapore I argued that, had they made a few better decisions, had their drivers make fewer mistakes and also had better reliability then they could still be in this championship.

It is a track which, it's fair to say, is not my favourite. That's not to say we won't get some decent racing here this weekend but just that it's a bit. Well, dull, flat and featureless. But others may have a differing opinion and that's okay.\n\nWe come into this weekend right after Ferrari's first 1-2 of the season and first in over two years. Sebastian Vettel's win in Singapore last week was their third in a row, which is the first time they have done this in the turbo-hybrid era and the first time, in fact, since 2008. That made it significant, of course, but there was also the fact that the Marina Bay Street Circuit was not a track that suited Ferrari's characteristics. Or so we thought...\n\nAnd so, we come to Sochi, a track where Mercedes have dominated, winning every round here since the race was staged on the old Winter Olympics site in 2014 for the first time. On current evidence it will be a slight surprise if the Silver Arrows manage to make it six in a row. Ferrari look strong.\n\nFerrari look to be the class of the pack again - on raw pace at least Credit: REX\n\nIn final practice Charles Leclerc led his team-mate Vettel by just over three-tenths of a second, with Lewis Hamilton just under a tenth of a second behind him. Valtteri Bottas, in the second Mercedes, was another couple of tenths away. The Red Bulls were not all that close to the front. Verstappen was nearly 1.5s of Leclerc's time and Alex Albon was seventh, behind Romain Grosjean's Haas.\n\nThere is a lot to be discovered about the true raw pace of some of these cars and as the track rubbers in that may change. Mercedes, though, seem to be fighting to get into contention here and, if that were to be the case, and they did not take pole position, would underline their extended slump. Mercedes have won just two in seven and have only been quickest in qualifying twice in that time as well.\n\nI'll be here for the next couple of hours with all the build-up and updates from qualifying. It begins in just over an hour.", "description": "Six tenths over Verstappen. Vettel only just beats Verstappen, though! 0.001s in it.
