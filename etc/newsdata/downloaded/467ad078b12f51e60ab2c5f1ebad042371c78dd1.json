The government gave lower figures but was continuing to update its information.\n\nThe dead included a municipal worker whose car was overcome by floodwaters and at least seven crew from a cargo ship that sank in Tokyo Bay on Saturday night, a coast guard spokesman said.\n\nFour others, from China, Myanmar and Vietnam, were rescued when the boat sank and the coast guard was still searching for a last crew member.\n\nWhile Hagibis, one of the most powerful storms to hit the Tokyo area in decades, packed wind gusts of up to 216 kilometres (134 miles) per hour, it was the heavy rains that caused most damage.\n\nA total of 142 rivers flooded, mainly in eastern and northern Japan, with river banks collapsing in two dozen places, local media said.\n\nIn central Nagano, a levee breach sent water from the Chikuma river gushing into residential neighbourhoods, flooding homes up to the second floor.\n\nAs water slowly receded Monday, television footage showed patients being transferred by ambulance from a Nagano hospital where some 200 people had been cut off by flooding.\n\nElsewhere, rescuers used helicopters to winch survivors from roofs and balconies, or steered boats through muddy waters to reach those trapped.\n\n\u2013 Japan dedicates rugby win to victims \u2013\n\nBy Monday afternoon, some 75,900 households remained without power, with 120,000 experiencing water outages.\n\nThe disaster left tens of thousands of people in shelters, with many unsure when they would be able to return home.\n\n\u201cEverything from my house was washed away before my eyes, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a dream or real,\u201d a woman in Nagano told NHK.\n\n\u201cI feel lucky I\u2019m still alive.\u201d\n\nThe storm brought travel chaos over the holiday weekend, grounding flights and halting commuter and bullet train services.\n\nBy Monday, most subway trains had resumed service, along with many bullet train lines, and flights had also restarted.\n\nThe storm also brought havoc to the sporting world, forcing the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and the cancellation of three Rugby World Cup matches.\n\nBut a crucial decider pitting Japan against Scotland went ahead, with the hosts dedicating their stunning 28-21 win to the victims of the disaster.\n\n\u201cTo everyone that\u2019s suffering from the typhoon, this game was for you guys,\u201d said Japan captain Michael Leitch.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of rescue workers in Japan battled on Monday to find survivors of a powerful typhoon that killed at least 43 people,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/28872d_110-000-rescue-workers-deployed-japan-people-affected-by-typhoon-hagibis-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
