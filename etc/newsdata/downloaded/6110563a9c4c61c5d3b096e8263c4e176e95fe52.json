Joe also pleaded guilty to one count of failing to file a tax return.\n\n\u2018RHONJ\u2019 STAR JOE GIUDICE BREAKS HIS SILENCE AFTER ARRIVING IN ITALY\n\nTeresa was sentenced in October 2014 to 15 months in prison and was released in December 2015. Joe was held by immigration officials after he completed his 41-month prison term this past March. A judge ruled in October 2018 that Joe, who is not an American citizen, would be deported to his native Italy upon completion of his prison sentence.\n\nWhile Teresa, 47, sat down in Cohen's New York studio, Joe, 49, joined in via satellite from Salerno, Italy where he is currently living while waiting for a ruling in his deportation case.\n\nInfidelity\n\nThe \"Real Housewives of New Jersey\" stars went back and forth over whether they had been faithful to each other while serving their respective prison sentences.\n\nIn February, Teresa was photographed holding hands with a man but denied they were an item. When Cohen asked Joe if he believed Teresa had been faithful, he said: \"No, I don't think so.\"\n\nTERESA GIUDICE SAYS HUSBAND JOE GIUDICE\u2019S DEPORTATION RULING IS TO \u2018MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF US\u2019\n\nBut Teresa fired back that Joe was \"photographed with women also\" to which Joe quipped, \"That\u2019s why it made it OK for you?\"\n\nJoe's weight loss\n\nJoe's dramatic weight loss was revealed after he left ICE custody and photos of him were shared online. Teresa acknowledged to Cohen that \"he's very fit\" and said Joe had been more \"fluffy\" before going to prison.\n\nJOE GIUDICE'S SHOCKING TRANSFORMATION REVEALED AFTER HE'S RELEASED FROM ICE CUSTODY\n\nBut Joe objected to Teresa's description of his pre-prison bod saying he had just been \"bloated.\"\n\n\"I was very, very, hard,\" he said.\"I might have been big, but I was never fluffy.\"\n\nThey didn't ask Donald Trump for help\n\nTeresa knows President Trump from her \"Celebrity Apprentice\" days but the Giudices told Cohen that the couple did not ask the president for help.\n\n\"He has so much on his plate, that guy,\u201d Joe said. \"Even if he could maybe try to do something, I don\u2019t know if he would get criticized. I don\u2019t know what they would do to him.\"\n\nTERESA GIUDICE QUESTIONING HER LOVE FOR HUSBAND JOE: 'I JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY AGAIN'\n\nTeresa added: \"Andy, with the whole immigration thing that\u2019s going on, that he\u2019s fighting for. I would never do that to the president.\"\n\nSelfies with ICE agents\n\nJoe claimed ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents took selfies with the former reality star as they escorted him on to the plane he took to Italy.\n\n\"I had two immigration officers, one on each side, taking selfies with me the whole time,\" Joe alleged. \"One guy in front, and I think there was someone else who carried a gun on a plane. You know, I\u2019m a very dangerous guy.\"\n\nHe added that they \"wanted to handcuff \" him but he said, \"I\u2019m not getting in no handcuffs.\"\n\n'HOUSEWIVES' STAR TO DIVORCE HUSBAND AFTER FIVE YEARS OF MARRIAGE\n\nHe said: \"They\u2019re like, \u2018Will you behave?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018What the hell am I going to do? If I wanted to leave, I would like just kick your butts and leave. I ain\u2019t going to do that. I go, \u2018I want to go on the plane. I want to get the hell out of here.'\"\n\nHe also shared that being in ICE custody \"is like having your head in a panini press.\"\n\nReality regrets?\n\nJoe said while his wife \"always wanted to be on television,\" he regrets agreeing to reality TV.\n\n'REAL HOUSEWIVES' STAR LUANN DE LESSEPS SHARES MISLEADING REVIEWS OF HER CABARET SHOW\n\n\"I wish I never would have done it,\" he said.\n\n\"I had a great life before. The show just brought a lot of attention to us. Just having a house like that alone just brings a lot of attention. I\u2019ve never had so many damn lawsuits in my life \u2019til I got on that show.\"\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nThe couple is not sure what the future holds for their relationship but they did confirm that Teresa and their four girls will not move to Italy even if Joe is deported from the United States.\n\n\"If we stay together, we stay together, if we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t,\" Joe said. \"As long as she\u2019s happy, that\u2019s all that really matters. I\u2019m not going to tell her what to do. If she doesn\u2019t feel like she wants to be with me anymore, then that\u2019s the thing to do.\"\n\nHe added, \"I\u2019ve been with her a long time. No matter what happens, I\u2019ll always love her.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I do love him as a person,\" said Teresa. \"I do care about him, I love him.\"\n\nThe couple who shares daughters Gia, 18, Gabriella, 15, Milania, 13, and Audriana, 10, have been married for 20 years.", "description": "Teresa Giudice reunited with Joe Giudice onscreen for the first time since her husband went to prison in 2016.", "authors": ["Sasha Savitsky", "You Can Find Sasha Savitsky On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/teresa-joe-giudice-display-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
