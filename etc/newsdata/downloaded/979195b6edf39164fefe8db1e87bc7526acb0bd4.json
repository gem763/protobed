He wrote \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe move drew backlash from China, and the Chinese Basketball Association and several TV providers suspended ties with the Rockets.\n\nSilver said in a statement on Monday that diversity is a strength of the league and that \u201cthe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d Many said those comments did not appear to defend Morey's freedom of expression.\n\nSilver also said on Tuesday that that he is \"sympathetic to our interests here and to our partners who are upset.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked about Chinese Central Television, a state television broadcaster in mainland China, refusing to air an exhibition game, Silver called the move \u201cunfortunate.\u201d He said he is traveling to Shanghai this week, and he hopes to meet with officials to work out the Chinese backlash against Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we expected to happen. I think it\u2019s unfortunate, but if that\u2019s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s critically important we adhere to those values,\u201d Silver said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my hope that when I\u2019m in Shanghai, I can meet with the appropriate officials and discuss where we stand, and, again, put those remarks from Daryl Moray and my remarks in an appropriate context of a many decades-long relationship, and see if we can find mutual respect for each other\u2019s political systems and beliefs. I\u2019m a realist as well, and I recognize that this issue may not die down so quickly,\u201d he continued.", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday doubled down on his support for Daryl Morey after\u00a0the Houston Rockets general manager tweeted\u00a0support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, sparking backlash from China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/silveradam_getty_100819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
