She goes on: \"I was really interested in the symbolism behind materials, and after grad school, I wanted to start to play with the canvas itself and play with dyes on the canvas.\"\n\nKing's focus on using the materials that are part of her daily life has extended to growing a garden devoted to creating dyes that stain her canvases. And in doing so, she maintains a physical relationship with the canvas that she hopes viewers feel too.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nGillian King explains how - and why - she uses (and grows) art materials very close to home. Filmmaker: Nicholas Castel 11:02\n\nThese are artworks that demand your close inspection. As King says, \"When you get closer to the painting \u2014 and I feel like I make paintings so people get close to them \u2014 you can start to notice interesting things happening with the surface of the canvas and with the materials. I have great conversations with gardeners. People who are used to working outside and working in soil and working with plants have a very particular reaction to the work that is almost as if they could have had a hand in making it, which I really love.\"\n\nIn this video by filmmaker Nicholas Castel, King takes you through her process \u2014 from visiting the dye garden to staining and then binding one of her huge canvases. It may make you look at the things around you very differently.\n\nSee the work of Gillian King as part of \"Terramatter\" at Ottawa City Hall Art Gallery, October 10-December 3.
