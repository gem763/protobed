Notable blocked mining scripts include CoinHive, JSE, and MineXMR.\n\nMozilla urged users keen on trying out the new crypto-jacking protections to enable them by default. It noted the functionality is included in Firefox Nightly build 68 and Firefox Beta build 67.\n\nTo turn on the new feature, Firefox users can follow these steps:\n\nClick the Firefox main menu\n\nChoose \u201cPreferences\u201d\n\nClick the \u201cPrivacy and Security\u201d tab\n\nUnder \u201cContent Blocking,\u201d click \u201cCustom\u201d\n\nFinally, check \u201cCryptominers\u201d and \u201cFingerprinters,\u201d blocking both\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce enabled, Firefox will block any scripts that have been identified by Disconnect to participate in crypto-mining or fingerprinting,\u201d said Mozilla, adding the protections would be turned on by default in Nightly in the coming weeks.\n\nMozilla warns that some sites could be inadvertently blacklisted while its dev team continues to iron out the new blocking feature. In such cases, users are advised to report these problems directly in-browser by clicking on the \u201cTracking Protection\u201d shield.\n\nMozilla says it will be looking to improve and expand the list of domains blocked by Firefox in the coming months. It also promised the crypto-jacking and fingerprinting protections will be enabled by default for all Firefox users in a future release.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that rival browser Opera released crypto-jacking protections early in 2018. Instead of Disconnect, though, it uses the NoCoin ad-block list to stop dodgy cryptocurrency mining scripts from running.\n\nDid you know?
