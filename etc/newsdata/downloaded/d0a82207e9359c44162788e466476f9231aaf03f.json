From the holding place a new journey would start about once a month. Her journey was divided into very different stages, and in every stage she stayed with Vietnamese people.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, the source added, those who make the trip in a lorry were dropped off not too far from the port of entry, before being left to make their way onwards and into the community in Britain.\n\nEssex lorry deaths: Vietnamese families fear for missing loved ones Read more\n\n\u201cWe were told by one of the girls that they were dropped off and left on their own and then found their way into a town centre. In most big centres in the UK you\u2019ll have nail shops, usually run by Vietnamese people. They said that they found a shop and went in.\n\n\u201cConditions in the nail bar were very bad, obviously, but it is relative. What is bad here might be very good by Vietnamese standards, and especially if they come from a rural area.\u201d\n\nApparently at least one of the girls wanted to stay in the UK. \u201cShe also came from the same province as the people who died in the lorry. The economic situation in that province is very bad.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the teenagers got on the radar of the police or the social services, who are now caring for them, but it\u2019s clear they are not the only ones.\n\nFigures released by the Home Office under the Freedom of Information Act disclose the cases of 121 Vietnamese nationals who were identified as possible victims of human trafficking last year.\n\nAdults receive 14 days of what the Home Office calls \u201cmove-on\u201d support including accommodation and subsistence, specialist assistance including counselling and access to physical and mental health care.\n\nThe numbers, released in February this year, are from a live database which is subject to change. Accurate statistics about the real numbers of trafficked Vietnamese people remain elusive, largely because most are hidden and undocumented.\n\nAccording to the Salvation Army, which works with victims of trafficking, more Vietnamese men were referred to the charity between July 2018 and July 2019 than any other nationality. The charity worked with 209 people from Vietnam over that period, a 248% increase on the number referred five years earlier.", "description": "Case of two teenagers taken in by social services reaffirms plight of young people attempting to escape poverty", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/483118219d7ea476634b34d7d9a715dcd3f41698/121_0_3785_2271/master/3785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ef8e02c960c8bb561be4df6d7c0bde5", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
