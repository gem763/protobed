That profile, however, included information about offensive tweets he had written in high school. Busch Light, which had announced a fundraising partnership with King, later severed its ties to him.\n\nThe paper denied its reporting was responsible for the beer company's decision, as critics said scouring King's social media presence for offensive old tweets was inappropriate in this case.\n\nIn a now-deleted post on the Facebook page for the Register\u2019s Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa (RAGBRAI), then-director TJ Juskiewicz alleged that the paper \"refused to offer me the opportunity to openly speak to the RAGBRAI Nation, and answer the hundreds of passionate questions asked about the future of RAGBRAI following the Des Moines Register\u2019s handling of the Carson King story.\"\n\nHe also claimed he could not reach out to riders because \"it did not mesh with the company\u2019s PR narrative to spin the Carson King embarrassment,\" adding that leadership at the Register didn't want to \"issue any more public statements on this matter\" and that RAGBRAI was offered \"talking points\" to use on the subject of the King story.\n\nAXED DES MOINES REGISTER REPORTER BLAMES 'RIGHT-WING IDEALOGUES' FOR FIRING, SUGGEST HE'S OPPRESSED\n\nHe wrote in response, \"I can no longer be an effective leader when my principles are compromised by the leadership of Gannett/Des Moines Register.\"\n\nJuskiewicz vowed to lead his own event called \"Iowa's Ride,\" which has been scheduled for the same time as next year's RAGBRAI event, KTIV reported.\n\nThe Register reported Tuesday that RAGBRAI will still happen next year, specifying that \"the marketing team\" behind the event had resigned.\n\n\"We'll continue RAGBRAI's longstanding tradition in 2020 with another great bicycle ride and strong partnerships with Iowa communities to raise money for good causes. Our commitment remains to donate $50,000 to the University of Iowa\u2019s Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital,\" an official from the Register's parent company, Gannett, said. \"We\u2019re proud of the good RAGBRAI has done for the state since 1973.\"\n\nDES MOINES REGISTER REPORTEDLY FACING THREATS, ADDS POLICE PRESENCE AFTER STORY BACKLASH\n\nRAGBRAI was founded by two Register columnists and has grown to gather 10,000 riders from across the country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Register did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the King piece grew bigger after Aaron Calvin, the journalist who reported on the tweets, was blasted for his own social-media posts deemed offensive. The Register ultimately fired him.", "description": "Staffers for an annual charity bike ride run by the Des Moines Register submitted resignations over the paper's handling of a story about\u00a0sudden philanthropist Carson King, according to an announcement Tuesday.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
