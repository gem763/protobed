If you look back a couple of years ago, a couple of World Cups ago, there were 70, 80-point drubbings for tier ones (teams) versus tier twos but now we are giving ourselves a chance 65 minutes into the game.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. defended stoutly to win turnovers on their try-line and showed cleaner hands and superior discipline on a night of stifling humidity.\n\nFlyhalf AJ MacGinty slotted three penalties and gave France flyhalf Camille Lopez competition for player of the match honours with his composed game management.\n\nWith France under huge pressure, MacGinty\u2019s third penalty pushed the U.S. to within three points in the 64th minute, but the Sale Sharks pivot said he had wanted to kick for the corner to seek a try and the chance to snatch an unlikely lead.\n\n\u201cMomentum probably swung our way there and they were under a lot of pressure so going for that try would\u2019ve been like a killer blow for them and their tails would\u2019ve been up,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for some fumbles when on attack in the French 22, the U.S. might have been contemplating an even bigger boilover than Japan\u2019s brilliant 19-12 win over Ireland last week.\n\n\u201cWhen we gave ourselves decent opportunities we\u2019d come under a little pressure and we\u2019d knock the ball on or concede a penalty but that\u2019s part of the learning curve,\u201d said Gold.\n\nThe buoyed Eagles will hope to apply that learning to their next Pool C clash against Argentina in a week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident for Argentina,\u201d Gold said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to play for us still, actually, so we\u2019re really excited about coming up against Argentina.\u201d", "description": "A 33-9 loss would not quite suggest that the Eagles have landed but United States coach Gary Gold was satisfied they were on the right trajectory after giving the French a Fukuoka fright night at the World Cup on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436286177&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9117B"}
