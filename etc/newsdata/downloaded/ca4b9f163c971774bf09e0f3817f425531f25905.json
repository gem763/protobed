Against the euro, sterling added as much as 0.8% to trade at 89.005 pence per euro ( ).\n\n(Graphic: Sterling bounces - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6103/6034/gbp.png)\n\nCredit Suisse (SIX: ) on Friday became the first major bank to change its view on UK equities, pointing to the reduced chances of the country crashing out of the EU and saying that some equities look cheap compared with foreign counterparts.\n\nWhile the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 has fallen sharply, Britain still faces months of uncertainty and the outcome is not clear.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Friday said the gap between Britain and the EU over Brexit remained \"very wide\".\n\nELECTION BASE CASE\n\nJohnson wants to call a general election but lawmakers have blocked his attempt to do so, saying they want to be sure he cannot push through a no-deal Brexit in the meantime.\n\nThree-month implied volatility for sterling - a gauge of expected price swings in the pound - remains elevated and higher than for other maturities, signalling investor expectations for heightened volatility in early to mid-December.\n\n\"Our base case scenario is that we are still heading for an early election in late November or early December, and we need a short extension [to the departure date for leaving the EU] to break the deadlock in parliament,\" Lee Hardman, a strategist at MUFG, said.\n\nHardman said there was some sense in the market that the government was ready to push for an all-Ireland backstop which, while angering the Northern Irish party that supports the government in the British parliament, would win over Brexiteers in Johnson's party.\n\nPushing through such a deal might require the Conservative Party to win an outright majority in any general election, a far from certain scenario, Hardman added.\n\nOpposition parties have vowed to block a no-deal Brexit but are divided about how to deliver Britain's exit from the EU.\n\n\"We'd be careful about chasing it [the pound] much higher,\" Hardman said. \"This is a short window of calm.\"", "description": "Sterling rockets as Irish backstop hopes add to Brexit optimism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8C0NT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
