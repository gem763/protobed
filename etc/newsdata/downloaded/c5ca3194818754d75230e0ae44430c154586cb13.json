In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\n\nThe White House refused to comply with Democrat demands for witnesses and documents, citing the \u201clegal and constitutional flaws\u201d in the process.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the letter was released, the White House sternly lectured the House Democrats for breaking precedent by hosting an impeachment process without holding an official vote.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in our nation\u2019s history, the House of Representatives is now purporting to proceed an impeachment inquiry against the president, without conducting a vote on the house floor,\u201d a senior White House official said in a call with reporters after the letter was released.\n\nThe official did not detail whether the president was willing to cooperate with the House of Representatives\u2019 inquiry if the vote passed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to speculate on what would happen in various hypothetical situations,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe letter was also addressed to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel, and House Committee on Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings.\n\nWhite House lawyers criticized Democrats\u2019 actions in denying the president the right to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, and receive testimony transcripts.\n\n\u201cAll of this violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent,\u201d the letter read. \u201cNever before in our history has the House of Representatives-under the control of either political party-taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue.\u201d\n\nThe letter argued that Democrats were using impeachment hearings to reverse the 2016 election and to influence the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThe Founders, however, did not create the extraordinary mechanism of impeachment so it could be used by a political party that feared for its prospects against the sitting President in the next election,\u201d it read.\n\nRead the full letter below:\n\nWhite House letter to Nancy Pelosi by charliespiering on Scribd", "description": "The White House on Tuesday sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi denouncing the impeachment inquiry begun in the House of Representatives.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/wi/ap/24/9b5c70_trump-russia-probe-32984-adam-schiff-nancy-pelosi-elijah-cummings-jerrold-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
