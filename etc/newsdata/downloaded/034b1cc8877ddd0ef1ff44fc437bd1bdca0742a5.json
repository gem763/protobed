(Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images)\n\nTry as he might, Tony Romo has never made the cut at a PGA Tour event. Frankly, he\u2019s never come particularly close in three tournaments, his best effort an 8-over-par 150 at last year\u2019s Byron Nelson that still fell six shots short on a Trinity Forest course he had played countless times as a member.\n\nRomo is taking another crack at it this week at the Safeway Open in California, and the thinking was that neither he nor CBS Sports would have to worry about him missing Sunday\u2019s NFL game between the Bears and Vikings in Chicago because of his history and because of the fact that the field is surprisingly stout for an early-season tournament: Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Thomas and Phil Mickelson are all on hand. SuperBook USA golf oddsmaker Jeff Sherman responded accordingly, giving Romo astronomical 10,000-to-1 odds of winning the tournament, and the Action Network\u2019s Darren Rovell promised to erase himself from Twitter if the former Cowboys quarterback was atop the leader board at the end of play Sunday.\n\nIf Tony Romo wins the Safeway Open, I will delete my Twitter account. \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) September 25, 2019\n\nSo of course Romo went out and shot a 2-under 70 in Thursday\u2019s first round, putting him in a tie for 28th and only five strokes behind leaders Adam Scott and Andrew Landry. That would be a stroke better than Thomas, the 2017 PGA Championship winner, and a full five shots better than Mickelson, who has five major championship trophies, three of them accompanied by green jackets.\n\nRomo seemed to be headed to his usual place at the bottom of the leader board after consecutive bogeys at Nos. 3 and 4 \u2014 his 12th and 13th holes of the day \u2014 put him at 1 over, but he responded with a birdie at the par-5 fifth and then finished off his round with birdies at Nos. 8 and 9.\n\nRomo rolled in 122 feet worth of putts for the day.\n\n\u201cSame thing I did in football,\u201d Romo told PGATour.com after his round when asked how he cobbled together his round. \u201cYou just start from the beginning. You\u2019re not very good, not very good, and then all of a sudden you make the leap somewhere and all of a sudden you can be more efficient and you can do things a little bit better.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to stink,\u201d Romo continued. \u201cI stunk a lot, so just trying to continue to improve and get better.\u201d\n\nThe full-time PGA Tour golfers on the course seemed to welcome this new challenger.\n\n\u201cI need to start making some birdies. I don\u2019t want to lose to a guy that does TV but I did,\u201d Thomas said with a laugh. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m happy for him. It\u2019s a lot of pressure for him to play out here, and everyone\u2019s kind of expecting him to fail and not play well.\n\n\u201cI hope he plays well [Friday],\u201d Thomas added. \u201cIt\u2019d just be kind of a smack in the face to all those people that were giving him crap before he teed off. He\u2019s a competitor.\u201d\n\nShould Romo make the cut, he will be replaced by Boomer Esiason in the CBS Sports booth alongside Jim Nantz for Sunday\u2019s Bears-Vikings game. His second round tees off at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on Friday.\n\nRead More:\n\nHe snagged a historic home run ball.
