I've said to myself that I look like a zombie,\" Steve said.\n\n\"I don't go out now, the weather is too cold and I can't chance it due to the risk of developing an infection.\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\n\"It's the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. The only way to describe it is that it's like someone sticking in knives at various points across your body continuously.\"\n\nThe man, from Honiton, Devon, spends 25 minutes every day dressing his wounds.\n\nThe condition can develop for no reason and results in boils and blisters developing into painful ulcers which ooze fluid across the body and can become dangerously infected.\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\nSteve, who lives with his partner, added: \"I need help washing and dressing, it's taken my independence away from me.\n\n\"If I go out people will just stare at me. Some people will come up and ask me 'what's wrong' but most just stare.\n\n\"I'm just trying to keep myself in a bubble and focus on getting better.\"\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\nHe's now appealing on GoFundMe for money to fund private treatment.\n\nIt would rid him of the boils, which he says are embarrassing.\n\n\"All I want is to live a normal life and to get back to work. For the condition to go away would be the world's best Christmas present. It would be a breath of fresh air,\" he continued.\n\nTo donate to Steve's appeal, click here .", "description": "WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Steve Young, from Honiton, Devon, had to quit his job because his pyoderma gangrenosum became so crippling", "authors": ["James Somper", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Caters News Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755992.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-SKIN-CONDITION-TURNS-MAN-INTO-ZOMBIE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
