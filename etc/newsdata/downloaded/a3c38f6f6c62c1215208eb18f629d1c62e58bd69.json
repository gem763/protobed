It would be the biggest power shutdown so far as utilities across the state attempt to reduce wildfire risk due to heavy wind. Utilities malfunctions have been tied to some of the state\u2019s most destructive fires, including last year\u2019s Camp fire, which devastated Paradise, Calif., and the 2017 wine country blazes.\n\n\u201cIt is a very blunt way of approaching the situation, but at the same time, there\u2019s an understanding of why it\u2019s being undertaken,\u201d said Sonoma County Supervisor David Rabbitt, who noted PG&E\u2019s announcement came on the second anniversary of the 2017 firestorm. \u201cWe have vulnerable populations, our elderly and young children. We\u2019re mostly concerned about them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shut-down will be PG&E\u2019s third in the last two months, the utility said. Power was restored within a day during the previous two events, but those were also for much smaller slices of its customer base.\n\n\u201cIt is very possible that customers may be affected by a power shut-off even though they are not experiencing extreme weather conditions in their specific location,\u201d the utility said in a statement. \u201cThis is because the electric system relies on power lines working together to provide electricity across cities, counties and regions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouthern California Edison announced it, too, was considering preventive power outages. The utility said that given the anticipated possibly strong Santa Ana winds , power could be cut off to more than 106,000 customers in parts of eight Southern California counties.\n\nEdison\u2019s possible outage would primarily affect customers in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Also under consideration are areas in Ventura County and portions of Kern, Tulare, Inyo and Mono counties.\n\nThe power shut-offs have generated debate, with some residents saying they create a whole new set of dangers as they try to watch for news about fires. There has been heightened concern about those with health issues who rely on medical equipment.\n\nThroughout Tuesday, the staff at the Ukiah Senior Center were scrambling to prepare for the planned outage, buying butane canisters at sporting goods stores so they could make coffee and freezing water bottles in case the power was out for days.\n\nRelief came in the form of an email, when city leaders alerted the community just after 3:30 p.m. that PG&E had indicated that Ukiah\u2019s electric system won\u2019t be affected by the planned outages. Local leaders did warn that, because extreme weather is expected, outages could still occur.\n\n\u201cPeople have been on pins and needles all day because of the uncertainty,\u201d said Diana Clarke, the senior center\u2019s executive director. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if they should go out and buy supplies, and especially with seniors, they don\u2019t have a lot of extra money.\u201d\n\nThe senior center provides residents with hot meals Monday through Friday and delivers meals to older residents who aren\u2019t able to leave their homes. On Tuesday, the center\u2019s outreach supervisor was busy calling people to tell them they weren\u2019t sure whether they would have electricity and thus be able to prepare meals for delivery, Clarke said.\n\nThere is a deep sense of frustration, and skepticism, in the community at the idea of losing power to protect them from wildfires, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPG&E should have been doing the proper maintenance for the last decade,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have been necessary [if they had], and I think that\u2019s what has got everyone so angry and frustrated with PG&E right now. This is a crisis of PG&E\u2019s making.\u201d\n\nBut it may also be the best option available as the utilities and the state face trade-offs between ensuring reliable power and the public\u2019s safety, said Michael Wara, director of Stanford University\u2019s climate and energy policy program.\n\n\u201cPower shut-offs in the face of really widespread dangerous fire weather, which is what we\u2019re confronting, may be the best thing we can do for the time being,\u201d Wara said. \u201cIn the long run, PG&E needs to fix its grid. And so does Edison ... so they can use power shut-offs as a more limited tool like a scalpel rather than the blunt instrument they have now.\u201d\n\nSome state and local officials also have complained that utilities don\u2019t always give enough notice before turning off the power. And they have expressed concerns about communications and evacuations if the power is out, especially if traffic signals don\u2019t work and cellphone service is affected.\n\nCaltrans announced it was closing multiple tunnels around the Bay Area as early as Tuesday evening because they require power to control traffic flow. Among them are the Caldecott Tunnel in Contra Costa County and the Tom Lantos Tunnels in Pacifica.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, at a bill signing ceremony in Oakland on Tuesday, defended PG&E\u2019s plans for the intentional power shutdowns.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we want to protect people. We want to make sure people are safe. This is what PG&E thinks is in the best interest of their customers and ultimately for this region and the state,\u201d the governor said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a massive inconvenience,\u201d he added. \u201cNo one wants to see this happen. But it is a public safety issue.\u201d\n\nWara compared it to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the rolling blackouts Californians experienced during the energy crisis of the early 2000s. He said while those events may have triggered blackouts that involved more customers, they weren\u2019t on the order of days like what PG&E is saying could happen here.\n\n\u201cThis kind of thing happens because of natural disasters, and here we\u2019re having an unnatural disaster to avoid an even worse natural disaster.\u201d\n\nSen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo), whose district may be affected by the blackouts, acknowledged there is a fire danger requiring some shutting down of power, but he called the extent of the possible outage troubling.\n\n\u201cI think it is excessive,\u201d said Hill, a longtime critic of the utility. \u201dPG&E clearly hasn\u2019t made its system safe. These shut-downs are supposed to be surgical. But shutting down power to 800,000 people in 31 counties is by no means surgical.\u201d\n\nHill, who convened a recent hearing on the Public Utility Commission\u2019s oversight of PG&E, called on the state agency to do a \u201croot cause\u201d analysis of the power shut-downs.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be something that can be acceptable nor long-term,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThis is third world, and we are not.\u201d\n\nIt also makes economic sense for the utility to make its grid more resilient, Wara said, because it\u2019s losing money when it has turned off the power.\n\nOnce the fire weather subsides, PG&E employees will check the grid in person and electronically before determining if it is safe to turn back on, a company official said.\n\nIt took the utility less than a day to restore power to customers during a three-county shut-off it performed last weekend and during another in September, the company said in a statement.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf expressed her concern over PG&E\u2019s timeline to restore power, but added she was grateful they had some time to prepare.\n\n\u201cWe expect PG&E to do everything to minimize the impact to residents,\u201d Schaaf said. \u201cThe idea of five days without electricity is devastating. We fully expect that to be a worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\nSerna and Cosgrove reported from Los Angeles, McGreevy from Sacramento.
