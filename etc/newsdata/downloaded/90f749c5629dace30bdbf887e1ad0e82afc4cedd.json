Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nIn the postgame locker room after the New Orleans Saints beat the Cowboys 12-0, tight end Jason Witten was frustrated.\n\nNot only had a previously strong Dallas offense sputtered, but Witten also had fumbled for just the ninth time in his then-243 career games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst feeling in the world,\u201d Witten told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cYou feel like you let the whole team down, the whole organization down.\u201d\n\nHe told reporters: \u201cNext Sunday can\u2019t get here fast enough.\u201d\n\nThen the Cowboys fell 34-24 to the Green Bay Packers. Aaron Rodgers notched his seventh win against the Cowboys in the last eight contests, with Witten suiting up for each of those losses, including two playoff eliminations. In Sunday\u2019s defeat, the Cowboys trailed 31-3 in the third quarter.\n\nIt was hardly the cathartic comeback game Witten sought after coming up short against the Saints. And yet, his takeaway from Dallas\u2019 second consecutive loss wasn\u2019t discouragement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited, kind of got a pep in my step for this week to be here,\u201d Witten told USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday, speaking in conjunction with Dr. Teal\u2019s Epsom Salt Soaks. \u201cThese last two games have been tough, but I feel like I\u2019m here for a reason. And part of that is in times like this. When the team is 3-2 and they\u2019re looking around, it\u2019s a great opportunity for me.\u201d\n\nThe chance to show leadership as a 16-year pro is one source of Witten\u2019s excitement for this week. But he also draws solace from the Cowboys\u2019 third- and fourth-quarter comeback run. Sure, they needed to ramp up production while curtailing turnovers in the first three quarters. Quarterback Dak Prescott\u2019s three interceptions and Brett Maher\u2019s two missed field goals stifled too many promising drives. But gaining 200 yards from the time 19 seconds remained in the third quarter was a significant achievement. So, too, were the 13 first downs and 21 points tallied in the fourth.\n\nWitten credits first-year offensive coordinator Kellen Moore for smart in-game adjustments.\n\n\u201cI think one of the areas he really shines is in game,\u201d Witten said. \u201cHis ability to make adjustments, see what they\u2019re doing and then countering that. It showed up in the Green Bay game.\u201d\n\nWhen the Packers stuck to man coverage despite their sizable third-quarter lead, Moore queued up plays for star receiver Amari Cooper, who powered double moves to a career-high 226 receiving yards. When Packers cornerback Tramon Williams shadowed receiver Michael Gallup tightly late in the third quarter, Moore and Prescott didn\u2019t hesitate to trust him on a go route on second-and-4. Gallup muscled the ball away from Williams and powered through cornerback Josh Jackson\u2019s leaping tackle to earn a 40-yard touchdown.\n\nDecisions like that, Witten said, will pay dividends later in the season.\n\n\u201c[Moore] kept adjusting to what they were doing,\u201d Witten said. \u201cAnd down the stretch, when you play against the best teams, the ability to adjust as a playcaller and as players in game and say, \u2018Yeah, OK, our film study said this, but we\u2019re seeing something different?\u2019 That\u2019s the chess match.\n\n\u201cI think Kellen\u2019s got a really good feel in how he communicates, how he adjusts to that in game that\u2019s allowing him to be as successful as he is.\u201d\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: New teams enter top 10 following losses by Cowboys, Chargers\n\nMORE: What happened to the Cowboys' run D vs. Packers?\n\nWitten is confident the Cowboys can rebound from their recent skid. He\u2019s excited to continue contributing in both the blocking and pass-catching phases, where he\u2019s snagged 17 of 20 targets for 173 yards and two touchdowns after a year-long retirement in 2018.\n\nThe 37-year-old says his body actually feels better so far after a year away from football\u2019s toll, as he fastidiously sticks to muscle recovery regiments like Dr. Teal\u2019s Epsom salts. Through five games, \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like I couldn\u2019t go out there and do the things I did 10 years ago,\u201d Witten said.\n\nHe sees promise in younger teammates, too.\n\nJust as Witten bounced back from the low of his New Orleans interception, he has no qualms that Prescott will move past the three interceptions he threw in a 463-yard, two-touchdown performance. Prescott, Witten said, will be ready for Dallas\u2019 next two contests against the Jets and Eagles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not one of those guys you have to worry about from that standpoint of you\u2019ve got to keep his confidence high or spirit the right way,\u201d Witten said. \u201creally it\u2019s just kind of a high five, show some energy to him, give him some love and move on to the next game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as poised as any teammate I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
