That is a great deal of money to blow on theatrics for a country that is still in economic freefall, suffering from a killer drought so severe that elephants are starving to death, providing health care so poor that it has been compared to genocide, grappling with unemployment so high the government refuses to measure it accurately, and facing perpetual strikes from the lucky few who do have regular jobs.\n\nThe Zimbabwean man on the street appears to be aware of these absurd realities but inclined to shrug them off and embrace the opportunity for a little government-funded entertainment, as South Africa\u2019s Independent Online (IOL) reported Tuesday:\n\nSome in the capital struggled to comprehend the rationale behind such events by a government that is failing to pay doctors and buy medicines, but they said they wouldn\u2019t mind the holiday. \u201cWe march, watch soccer, eat, drink and dance the night away \u2026 then what next?\u201d asked Chengetedzo Mbundure, an office worker in Harare. \u201cIt is unnecessary but it is welcome. Who doesn\u2019t love a holiday?\u201d\n\nAnother South African news site, TimesLIVE, sighed that \u201cMnangagwa\u2019s establishment has not departed from the Mubage era modus operandi,\u201d a reference to the famously corrupt and brutal dictator Robert Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe across decades of decline before his old henchman Mnangagwa was finally able to depose him in a coup.\n\nTimesLIVE suggested Mnangagwa\u2019s insistence on \u201cdrumming up a sideshow\u201d to protest sanctions instead of addressing the \u201charassment of opposition\u201d and \u201csuppression of human rights\u201d that inspired them will convince Western powers to keep those sanctions firmly in place.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government said it would organize demonstrations in cities other than the capital of Harare as well, and was counting on other members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to commemorate Anti-Sanctions Day by \u201ccalling for the removal of the illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by Western countries.\u201d\n\nThe SADC has been on board with \u201cAnti-Sanctions Day\u201d since it was first proposed over the summer. After a summit meeting in August, the SADC lobbied the African Union to embrace the protest as well, claiming the sanctions against Zimbabwean officials are damaging the economy of the entire region.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that again it was emphatic that there was no cause or need for sanctions to continue; after all, the basis for the sanctions are not there anymore, and they were illegal at the time when they were imposed by a few Western countries, America and the EU [European Union],\u201d Zimbabwean President Mnangagwa said at the SADC summit.\n\nBoth the U.S. and European Union deny their sanctions, all targeted at specific individuals, have any great effect on either Zimbabwe\u2019s economy or the region surrounding it. The Trump administration extended sanctions on 141 Zimbabwean entities and individuals in May despite calls from African leaders to lift them, saying the pressure would remain in place until Mnangagwa changes laws that suppress political opposition and restrict media freedom.\n\n\u201cOur pressure on Zimbabwe remains in place. We are trying to use this pressure to leverage political and economic reforms, human rights observations. We want to see fundamental changes in Zimbabwe and only then will we resume normal relations with them,\u201d U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Manisha Singh explained in September 2018.\n\nMany of the U.S. and EU sanctions designate specific individuals for gross human rights violations. For example, in August the U.S. added a travel ban on Anselem Nhamo Sanyatwe, a former military officer and currently Zimbabwe\u2019s ambassador to Tanzania, because he participated in \u201cviolent crackdown against unarmed Zimbabweans during post-election protests on August 1, 2018 that resulted in six civilian deaths.\u201d\n\nOne particular sanction that would arguably have broad economic effects was added just recently: at the beginning of October, the United States banned the trading of diamonds from Zimbabwe due to allegations of massive corruption in the industry and the use of forced labor at diamond mines.", "description": "Zimbabwe designates October 25 as \u201cAnti-Sanctions Day,\u201d a new \u201choliday\u201d intended to protest ongoing U.S. and EU sanctions.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Emmerson-Mnangagwa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
