Photo: Kelly Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nWomen across the country are suing Lyft for allegedly mishandling and concealing their sexual-assault and rape complaints against drivers, CNN reports.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court on Wednesday, 14 women accuse the ride-hail company of failing victims of sexual assault every step of the way: They claim that Lyft not only \u201cstonewalls\u201d authorities from investigating sexual-misconduct claims made against drivers, but that the company also does not notify victims about the status of their claims. This, the women claim, is deliberate: They say Lyft is choosing to \u201chide and conceal\u201d the platform\u2019s major \u201csexual predator crisis.\u201d\n\nThe alleged assaults, which occur between January 2018 and June 2019, are nothing short of disturbing. In one particular instance, one woman claims that after a Lyft driver raped her during her ride, he used her phone to add a $25 tip at the end. And the way that Lyft allegedly responds to such incidents compounds the horror. In one instance, a blind woman who says a Lyft driver forced himself into her house and raped her had to repeatedly contact Lyft to get a status update after making a complaint; according to the suit, a week after the alleged rape, she was informed that the investigation into her case had been closed because police \u201chad no evidence that the incident was not consensual.\u201d In another alleged incident, the suit claims that a driver continued to work for the company after driving a women to a beach, where he raped her.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News on Wednesday, Mary Winfield, Lyft\u2019s head of Trust and Safety, called the allegations \u201cterrifying\u201d and spoke of her company\u2019s \u201ceffort to ensure our riders and drivers have the safest possible experience.\u201d However, it was only this past April that the company announced it would be enforcing continuous criminal background checks on all drivers \u2014 plus, the suit alleges that the nature of these checks are inadequate. Lyft has also touted a sexual-harassment training for drivers, though the New York Daily News notes that it is not mandatory.\n\nTo help improve safety, the suit suggests measures such as adding a feature to the app that would notify passengers when the driver had deviated from the appropriate route.\n\n\u201cLyft could make simple changes to their app to protect passengers and eliminate future assaults but they have chosen not to,\u201d Mike Bomberger, a lawyer behind the lawsuit, told CNN in a statement.\n\nStay in touch.
