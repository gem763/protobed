Oh well, maybe next time!\" he tweeted.\n\nHe took aim specifically at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and the \"Squad\" of progressive freshman congresswomen led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nThe president's comments came as House Democrats continued investigating the Trump administration and pursued an official impeachment inquiry surrounding his July phone call with Ukraine's president. Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into corruption suspicions surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic party's frontrunner for challenging Trump in 2020.\n\nINTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING\n\nOn Thursday, Schiff pressed Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on his decision to not to relay a whistleblower complaint about that call. Instead of sending the complaint to the inspector general, Maguire notified the White House.\n\nBoth Schiff and \"Squad\" members have painted the transcript of that call as damning evidence that Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOn Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez appeared to poke fun at Trump's insult by retweeting a post likening Trump's \"AOC Plus 3\" label to a \"remix.\"\n\n'SQUAD' MEMBERS CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT AFTER TRUMP RELEASES UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT: 'WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT'\n\n\"To be honest, it should really be @AyannaPressley plus 3 since she is *easily* the best singer out of all of us,\" she said, referring to the Massachusetts congresswoman.\n\nNadler also responded on Saturday, accusing Trump of trying to create a distraction from the Ukraine controversy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Don\u2019t let the President change the subject. He got caught soliciting a foreign leader for help with his campaign at the expense of U.S. national security. Again,\" he said.\n\nTrump, on Wednesday, released a rough transcript of his call with Zelensky. Neither that transcript nor the whistleblower report contained an explicity quid pro quo offer of foreign aid for an investigation into Biden. But some Democrats have suggested the transcript clearly showed Trump seeking some kind of exchange with the Ukrainian government.", "description": "President Trump launched a fresh attack on prominent Democrats Saturday, accusing leading impeachment proponents of stalling progress and acting like savages.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
