He wheeled her sick husband out of the room before pouncing on the helpless woman\n\nConstance would much rather not of had to deal with the aged-carers who frequently visited her Glen Waverley home - in Melbourne's southeast.\n\nShe had taken a 'leap of faith' to trust men - complete strangers to her - inside her safe haven\n\nIt had taken her seven years to finally become comfortable with the intrusion.\n\nConstance was raped in January by Prodanovich as she lay in her own bed.\n\nAlthough a stranger to her, the 59-year old Springvale man was like many who had come to help Constance and her husband as in-home carers.\n\nThe sad reality of age had caught up with the couple, and their three daughters had hoped the carers would allow their beloved parents to live a little longer in the comfort of their own home.\n\nConstance had struggled through her own ordeals with a life well-lived.\n\nHer body was a mess, but her husband was in much worse shape.\n\nHe had been been her rock - a man who from a bygone era had spoiled his wife and acted in every way the part of a traditional husband.\n\nStill, Constance had been an independent woman, with good friends and a good social life.\n\nBoth had been active in the community, but as health complications saw Constance's husband lose the use of his legs, she knew her daughters couldn't take the burden themselves.\n\nBeing home bound was tough on the entire family.\n\nThe couple were isolated.\n\nConstance became a wiz on the computer, finding enjoyment in a technology that could have passed her by.\n\nIn constant pain and confined mostly to their homes, the couple treasured catch-ups with family and news of the world that was carrying on without them.\n\nIt had taken the couple years to accept outside help.\n\nConstance had never even been in a taxi before her husband became unwell.\n\nShe had been a proud woman, who did not wish to inconvenience anyone - particularly not her daughters.\n\nHer husband's mind had remained sharp, despite the deteriorating condition of his body.\n\nSo when his wife was raped in their own home, it felt as brutal as if it had happened on the day of their marriage some 60 years earlier.\n\nThere was nothing he could do.\n\nTheir tormentor had only been in the aged-care business for a little over a year when he pounced on his helpless victim.\n\nA royal commission into aged care has been running in Australia for weeks. The commission has heard a series of shocking examples of elder abuse by carers\n\nSince the attack, their life has fallen apart.\n\nConstance's husband has been forced into respite care and one of her daughter's has moved in to live with her full-time.\n\nShe is terrified getting into a taxi with strange men and petrified of any male doctor or nurse who attends to her.\n\nWhile on a stay in hospital, Constance convinced doctors she was alright just so she could get out of a hospital full of strange men.\n\nHer daughter found her unconscious on the floor of her home the next day and she was taken back.\n\nShe had been alone because no-one could trust the in-home carers.\n\nConstance remained at hospital shaking and hiding under her covers, trapped and afraid.\n\nHer daughters described the impact as 'incomprehensible'.\n\n'It's timeless and it's effects will endure,' Prodanovich was told.\n\nProdanovich had been employed by Omni-Care, which boasts online that its carers help 'maintain the quality of life, dignity and independence of people living in our community who are elderly, disabled or who have serious medical conditions'.\n\nOn January 12, Prodanovich entered the unlocked home of his victim and gave her husband a sponge bath.\n\nWhen done, Constance mentioned she needed her medications to help with her legs.\n\nProdanovich told her to forget about the meds and that a massage would help.\n\nHe wheeled her husband into the lounge room and when he returned began to massage the trusting woman.\n\nWhat happened next was the stuff of nightmares, with Prodanovich raping the terrified woman, who begged him to stop.\n\nProdanovich had been employed by Omni-Care, which boasts online that its carers help 'maintain the quality of life, dignity and independence of people living in our community who are elderly, disabled or who have serious medical conditions'\n\nCounty Court of Victoria Judge Susan Pullen will hand down her sentence on Simon Prodanovich on Thursday. He is expected to get a jail term somewhere close to 10 years\n\nHe fled the house and the police were called into investigate.\n\nWhen questioned days later, Prodanovich came armed with a prepared statement.\n\nHe indignantly denied the allegations, describing Constance's complaint as 'fabricated' and 'totally false'.\n\nBut he didn't stop there, going so far as to say the elderly woman had made the complaint in 'revenge' for him refusing to rub lotion on her.\n\nHe said he was 'gobsmacked' that a woman of her age would 'slander' him.\n\nProdanovich maintained his cruel facade right up until he knew he could no longer deny it.\n\nDNA he had left from injuries within his victim revealed the grubby truth and Prodanovich confessed.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to rape in the County Court of Victoria and faces up to 25 years in prison.\n\nThe father of a daughter himself, Prodanovich could give no explanation for his offending, telling a psychiatrist it was a 'brain fade'.\n\n'I felt really fooled and betrayed,' Constance told the court through her daughters.\n\nShe told the court she now feared all men and was frightened to be treated by any male nurse or doctor.\n\nShe further criticised Omni-Care for its handling of her care.\n\n'I remember what happened and sometimes cry,' she stated.\n\nBarrister Ian Crisp said his client, Simon Prodanovich, had no explanation for his offending other than describing it as a 'brain fade'\n\nSimon Prodanovich's victim (not pictured) is now too scared to be in the company of strange men. It has seen her go home too early from hospital and collapse at home alone\n\n'Be very careful whom you let into your home and life,' her daughter warned.\n\n'Mum must now live with this brutal and merciless touch,' another said.\n\nBarrister Ian Crisp, for Prodanovich, said his client was 'ashamed and sorrowful' for what he did to the woman.\n\n'He's too ashamed to ever explain what he did,' he said.\n\nCounty Court Judge Susan Pullen was scathing in her assessment of his client.\n\n'Your own expert described it as despicable,' she said. 'It's downright grubby ... What we're dealing with here is absolutely appalling. It's effectively wrecked her life.'\n\nJudge Pullen further condemned Prodanovich for his earlier denials before DNA caught him out.\n\n'He was gonna give it a run,' she said. 'And then after his denials he makes a self-serving statement.'\n\nJudge Pullen said there were numerous aggravating factors, including the fact he was her carer and breached the trust of his victim and her husband.\n\n'There is no doubt the impact has been enormous,' she said.\n\nMr Crisp argued that Prodanovich's attack had been unplanned and opportunistic.\n\n'It was on the spur of the moment,' he argued.\n\nBut Judge Pullen questioned that, observing his client had wheeled his victim's husband out of the room and licked his fingers.\n\n'There's just no explanation,' she said.\n\nJudge Pullen remanded Prodanovich in custody in anticipation of sentencing him on Thursday.", "description": "An elderly grandmother kept the door of her home unlocked unaware that the man who would tear apart her family's life would be welcomed inside.", "authors": ["Wayne Flower In Melbourne For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/05/19976048-0-image-a-20_1571631839492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
