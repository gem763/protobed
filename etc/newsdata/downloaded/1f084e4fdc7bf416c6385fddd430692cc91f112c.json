As it turns out, Judge Andrew Napolitano told his colleagues on Donald Trump\u2019s favorite morning show, it was John Boehner and the House Republican majority in 2015. \u201cI read the House rules,\u201d Napolitano told Fox & Friends, and \u201cthis initial level of inquiry can be done in secret.\u201d Secret interviews were conducted in both the Nixon and Clinton impeachments, although by staff rather than by the committees involved, Napolitano notes, so what Schiff is doing isn\u2019t without precedent after all:\n\nAndrew Napolitano: \"As frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors \u2026 they are consistent with the rules. \u2026 When were the rules written last? In January of 2015. And who signed them? John Boehner. And who enacted them? A Republican majority.\" pic.twitter.com/Zl10ZNugf4 \u2014 Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) October 24, 2019\n\nThis is a good rebuttal to accusations of a star-chamber approach, but it\u2019s not a complete defense to them. While the idea of interviews and depositions being taken in secret are not new, this process for doing them is at best proving problematic. Staff attorneys would probably know to keep their mouths shut about what transpires in such depositions, but Schiff\u2019s panel has been selectively leaking like a sieve ever since they started. His Democratic panel members have been all over the news making claims about blockbuster opening statements and testimony.\n\nJudge Napolitano notes that this is similar to a grand-jury process where testimony will later get tested in court. Only in form is that statement true. In practice, grand juries take secret testimony all the time, but they are also forbidden by law to comment publicly on it. Schiff\u2019s panel is trying the case in public without the president or his legal team able to access the witnesses or testimony, which seems less like a grand jury and more like a kangaroo court \u2026 or a star chamber.\n\nThe result of this is a process devoid of credibility, through the fault of Schiff and his House Democratic team. Furthermore, it\u2019s entirely unclear that this will ever move to a fair process before the House votes on articles of impeachment. Napolitano is correct that staff attorneys took secret testimony in the previous two impeachment inquiries, but they then held public hearings for the cross-examinations that he describes, allowing the American public to see in real time what was being said and how reliable it was. Schiff\u2019s use of the rules is aimed to avoid that step and go directly to impeachment, forcing the Senate to do the job the full House should have done in the first place.\n\nJust because the rules allow it doesn\u2019t make it good. Or right, either.", "description": "\"This initial level of inquiry can be done in secret.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/judge-nap-rules.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
