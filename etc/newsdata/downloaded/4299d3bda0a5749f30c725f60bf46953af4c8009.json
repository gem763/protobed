Dogs do that as well. And when you see them necking, it\u2019s fighting. It\u2019s vicious. They can kill each other.\u201d\n\nDr Natalie Cooper, a researcher in life sciences at the Natural History Museum, sees things slightly differently. According to her understanding of giraffe research, same-sex necking, licking, nuzzling and mounting is not always an aggressive act. Indeed, it may not be aggressive at all, and sometimes includes genital stimulation. It is common among males, but has been seen among females too. \u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t think we have enough research to know why the males do it,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThere are usually females around, so it\u2019s not just because there are no females.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Theguardian.Com Science Shortcuts Oct"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
