Fellow actor Sam Waterston was also in the group, which included many older demonstrators.\n\nNow 81, Fonda said she plans to get arrested every Friday to advocate for urgent reduction in the use of fossil fuels. She hopes to encourage other older people to protest as well.\n\nGetting arrested in 2019, poses some entirely new challenges, Fonda told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nThese days, \u201cthey use white plastic things on your wrists instead of metal handcuffs, and that hurts more,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe only problem for me is I\u2019m old,\u201d Fonda said. After her first arrest last week, she had trouble getting into the police vehicle because she was handcuffed behind her back and \u201chad nothing to hang on to.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Fonda emerged from a cluster of officers and stepped smartly into the police wagon, her hands cuffed in front of her.\n\n\u201cThanks, Jane!\u201d some of the protesters called out.\n\n\u201cWhat would you tell President Trump?\u201d someone in the crowd yelled to her earlier, as she and other protesters stood on their platform in front of the Capitol.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t waste my breath,\u201d she shouted back, drawing laughter.\n\nThe rally drew at least a couple of hundred people, young and old.\n\nWhile Fonda has taken part in many climate demonstrations, she said Greta Thunberg\u2019s mobilization of international student strikes and other activism, along with the climate writing of author Naomi Klein, prompted her to return to courting arrests for a cause.\n\nFonda cannot remember precisely which cause led to her last arrest in the 1970s.\n\nShe said her target audience now is people like her who try to cut their plastic use and drive fuel-efficient cars, for instance, but otherwise \u201cdon\u2019t know what to do and they feel helpless,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to become more active, across the age spectrum.\u201d\n\nEspecially in the U.S., young people appear to be driving many of the protests and rallies demanding government action on climate change, University of Maryland sociologist Dana Fisher said.\n\nNearly half of the people who turned out for a September climate protest in Washington were college age or younger, and a quarter were 17 or younger, for instance, Fisher said. Most were female.\n\nOn the other hand, it was older, white females who turned out for earlier protests during the Trump administration, like the women\u2019s marches, Fisher noted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole group of very activated, middle-age white women. They woke up after the election, and they haven\u2019t gone back to bed,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nSo far, those people have not been involved in the youth climate movement. Fonda\u2019s efforts could \u201cget them out there,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nIf her efforts misfire, Fisher added, the older people risk making the movement look uncool.\n\nAsked how she would answer any young climate activist who complained of being co-opted, Fonda said, \u201cI would hug them.\u201d\n\nAnd she did just that with some of the teenagers and other young activists she invited up to the stage to speak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Jane is doing, to try to shift the paradigm so it\u2019s not just falling on young people\u201d to rally the public on fossil fuel emissions, said Joe Markus, a 19-year-old Washington-area student attending Friday\u2019s protest.\n\nLeslie Wharton, 63, from Bethesda, Maryland, sat out the Vietnam War protests that drew out Fonda. She came out Friday as part of a group calling itself Elders Climate Action.\n\nLots of people of all ages are worried about climate change and want to do something, Wharton said, but \u201cus elders are retired or part-time. We can take the time.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Inspired by the climate activism of a Swedish teenager, Jane Fonda said Friday that she is returning to civil disobedience nearly a half-century after she was last arrested at a protest.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ellen Knickmeyer"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/aptopix_climate_protests_fonda_38289_c0-152-3688-2303_s1200x700.jpg?f675bc3844bef138ce4bb4403966c7dcdbc5bebb", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
