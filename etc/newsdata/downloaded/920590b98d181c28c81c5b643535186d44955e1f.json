We will fully cooperate with the investigation,\" he told reporters.\n\nPrevious serious bridge incidents in Taiwan have mostly been related to typhoons.\n\nIn 2009, two bridges were badly damaged by Typhoon Morakot, which left more than 400 people dead.\n\nTaiwan, which lies near the junction of two tectonic plates, is also frequently jolted by earthquakes.\n\nThe island's worst tremor in recent decades was a 7.6-magnitude quake in 1999 that killed around 2 400 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings.\n\nAlthough the devastating quake had ushered in stricter safety codes, several fatal incidents in recent years have triggered probes into shoddy construction.\n\nIn 2018, a developer, an architect and a civil engineer were indicted over the partial collapse of a building that killed 14 people during an earthquake earlier that year.\n\nIt followed a similar incident in 2016 when another quake killed 117 people - most in a single apartment block that collapsed.", "description": "Five people are feared missing after a towering arch bridge in eastern Taiwan collapsed, sending an oil tanker truck falling onto boats below.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9303/8bb3793fa4c7475c91aa8cda1583d061.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
