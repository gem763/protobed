Plus there\u2019s an artificial marble floor in the entrances so guests feel extra special.\n\nThe Japanese Laview commuter train has sofa-like seats, soft lighting and huge panoramic windows\n\nThe seats have adjustable headrests and armrest tables. The meaning of Laview is 'L' for luxurious living, 'a' for speedy like an arrow and 'view' for the panoramic views\n\nThe outside is quite something too.\n\nIt\u2019s coated with aluminium paint \u2013 apparently so it blends in with both urban and countryside landscapes \u2013 and the cab features a large curved window with a radius of 1.5 metres, the first in Japan to use such large format. This front curve streamlines the overall shape of the train while softly adapting to its surroundings, the designers said.\n\nThe fact that the train, which is operated by Seibu for commuters, looks so striking is perhaps less surprising once the person behind the design is revealed \u2013 Pritzker Prize-winning architect Kazuyo Sejima.\n\nThe train was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Kazuyo Sejima. It was her first ever train design\n\nLaview is coated with aluminium \u2013 apparently so it blends in with both urban and countryside landscapes \u2013 and the cab features a large curved window with a radius of 1.5 metres\n\nShe\u2019s never designed a train before, but certainly seems to have got the hang of it.\n\nShe said: \u2018I was approached to develop a train car concept, as never seen before.\n\n\u2018This is my first time to design a train and the most obvious difference with building design is that the train can move to different places.\n\n\u2018This train moves through Tokyo to the mountains of Chichibu and I thought it would be nice for the train to be able to respond and softly blend into the surroundings.\n\n\u2018Also, I wanted to make a train that feels like a living room where passengers can freely relax and feel motivated to ride the train every day.'\n\nThe train is called Laview \u2013 'L' for luxurious living, 'a' for speedy like an arrow and 'view' for the panoramic views \u2013 and has operated in eight-car sets between Tokyo's Ikebukuro station and Chichibu in neighbouring Saitama prefecture since March.\n\nThe train has operated in eight-car sets between Tokyo's Ikebukuro station and Chichibu in neighbouring Saitama prefecture since March", "description": "The train is called Laview and was designed by\u00a0Pritzker Prize-winning architect Kazuyo Sejima.
