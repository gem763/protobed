The central bank pledged to carry out up to $75 billion of repos on Wednesday. As part of the repurchasing operations, the central bank buys Treasurys and other highly rated debt from dealers in order to inject liquidity into the system. The decision comes in the wake of a recent spike in repurchasing rates, a short-term borrowing rate utilized by hedge funds and banks. That has, in turn, pushed the fed funds rate to the top of its target range, raising concerns the U.S. central bank is losing control of its benchmark interest rate.", "description": "The New York Federal Reserve announced it would carry out its second repurchasing operation of the week on Wednesday, after it conducted $53 billion of repos...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
