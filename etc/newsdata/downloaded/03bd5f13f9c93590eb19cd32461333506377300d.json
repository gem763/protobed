In the German newspaper Die Welt, music critic Manuel Brug described female performers as \"dicke Frauen,\" which means fat or thick women, \"in tight corsets spreading their legs in private rooms.\"\n\n\"He kind of used me and my colleague as symbols of what he, I guess, doesn't like to see on stage,\" Lewek, who plays the character Eurydice, told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\n\"It just felt like a very derogatory way of describing my character and of just everything that was going on on stage.\"\n\nWriter, editors stand by comments\n\nLewek has since spoken out on Twitter and in the media about how women are treated in the industry, and how painful it is to read descriptions of her body so soon after having a baby.\n\n\"It's never OK to comment on a woman's body, but it felt like the sting was extra sharp, I guess, because I'm in what feels like a very vulnerable time,\" she said.\n\nOther performers have come out in support of Lewek, and the Salzburg Festival's president Helga Rabl-Stadler issued a statement commending her \"extraordinary artistic achievement as well as on her courage against body-shaming.\"\n\nLewek is pictured Marcel Beekman, left, and Martin Winkler, right, during a production of Orpheus in the Underworld. (Monica Ritterhaus/Salzburg Festival )\n\nBut Brug is standing by the article, insisting his comments have been taken out of context by English speakers.\n\nIn a phone call with As It Happens, Brug said he wasn't criticizing Lewek, but rather the show's director Barrie Kosky, who he says used large women in skimpy outfits to comedic effect.\n\n\"I didn't like the misogynistic view of the overweight women because he exposed them as overweight with the costumes they were wearing,\" he said. \"That was my intention that I wanted to say that I did not like this idea, how he presented these women.\"\n\nThe opera, originally written by Jacques Offenbach, is a comical and hypersexualized lampooning of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice in which the actors are scantily clad and the performances are burlesque in style.\n\n\"If she doesn't want to look overweight on the stage, she should go on and have a different costume,\" Brug said.\n\nBrug's editors are standing by him.\n\nWhen Lewek wrote to Die Welt express her displeasure with Brug's words, editor-in-chief Ulf Poschardt\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b replied that the article \"was not meant as a personal insult \u2013 and it is not written as a personal insult.\"\n\n\"What Manuel Brug is aiming at, is a theatrical stereotype ... which uses (or abuses) a certain type of female stage character to achieve an atmosphere of cheap laughter, like in an English pantomime or in the Italian Commedia dell'arte.\"\n\nGrasping at straws\n\nLewek called Brug's response \"laughable\" and \"hurtful.\"\n\n\"If he truly was displeased with the esthetic of the Commedia dell'arte idea with theatre then why doesn't he go after other elements instead of just the fat women?\" she said.\n\n\"He's grasping at straws. He's looking for a reason to defend what he's talking about. But the bottom line is that he seems most displeased by seeing overweight women.\"\n\nShe says she was most offended by his comments about her costume.\n\n\"To respond by saying that somehow it was my fault because I allowed myself to be in a certain type of costume? This is the same type of thing that we hear now about women getting raped and people saying, 'Well, she had a glass of wine or she was wearing a sexy outfit so she was asking for it,'\" she said.\n\nKathryn Lewek says her costumes in Orpheus in the Underworld were '100 per cent comfortable' and the show was 'sexually liberal.' (Monica Ritterhaus/Salzburg Festival )\n\nLewek says she mulled over Brug's comments for a week and discussed them with her family before finally deciding to speak out.\n\n\"I knew that there would be backlash, but I also knew that it would be worth it with the message that I could get across,\" she said.\n\n\"The bottom line is craft over body, and that young singers need to know that despite any way that they look or, you know, body image issues that they might have, that there is a place for them in the arts.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
