There's nothing there. There's nothing wrong. There's nothing that should have been so controversial,\" she said, as quoted by the New York Times.\n\nPrior to the opening of \"HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails,\" Goldsmith called the emails \"the most important political documents of our times.\"\n\n\"They have been discussed at every level of public opinion but almost no one has read them. Hidden in full view, all the e-mails were available online but nevertheless they have become a sort of ghost. 'HILLARY' is their first public appearance,\" he added.\n\nAccording to promotional material for the exhibition, the artist printed all the 62,000 pages of emails, \"which, according to WikiLeaks, were sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013.\"\n\n\"HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails\" will be on view until November 24 in the Despar Teatro Italia in Venice, as part of the 58th Biennale of Visual Arts.", "description": "The former presidential candidate visited the exhibition \"HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails\" by American artist Kenneth Goldsmith, which is currently on view at the Venice Biennale.
