On \u201cLights Out with David Spade\u201d Monday, former \u201cSNL\u201d player Spade opted to \u201cstay out of the fray.\u201d But guest Jim Jefferies did not. \u201cThis is just canceled culture,\u201d he said, in the clip below. \u201cThe guy shouldn\u2019t have been fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we going to get rid of every sketch that \u2018SNL\u2019 has done that involves race?\u201d he added. \u201cI remember John Belushi dressing as an Asian man with a samurai sword. That was the whole sketch.\u201d\n\nFellow guest and comedian Bill Burr said: \u201cWe\u2019re not running for office. When is this going to fucking end?\u201d", "description": "Schneider, a former \"SNL\" star, tweeted that the Asian-slurring Gillis was a victim of \"cultural unforgiveness.\"", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80b584230000580555ac57.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
