It\u2019s kind of burning.\u201d\n\nCrutsinger then began coughing and breathing heavily and then made snoring noises at least 29 times before he stopped moving.\n\nAt 6:40 p.m. CT \u2014 13 minutes after the lethal dose started \u2014 Crutsinger was pronounced dead.\n\nInvestigators said Crutsinger killed the two women and stole Syren\u2019s car and credit card. Police arrested Crutsinger three days later at a bar in Galveston, over 300 miles away.\n\nMichele Hartmann, one of the prosecutors with the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office who convicted Crutsinger, told jurors Crutsinger\u2019s actions had nothing to do with alcohol but were the result of \u201cevil.\u201d\n\nFriends and family described Magouirk, known as \u201cR.D.,\u201d as an avid gardener. Syren volunteered as a receptionist at her church. Both women were retired and lived together.\n\nMEGHAN MCCAIN MOCKED AFTER EXPLAINING HER PRO-GUN STANCE ON 'THE VIEW'\n\nCrutsinger had been \u201cspiraling downward much of his adult life,\u201d including three failed marriages and a propensity for violence when he drank, according to a report by a forensic psychologist hired by his trial attorneys.\n\nIn the months before the murders, Crutsinger became homeless and increasingly desperate after his wife kicked him out of their home and his mother, who had enabled his behavior, stopped helping him, according to the report.\n\nWhen Crutsinger realized Magouirk and Syren didn\u2019t have enough work to give him much financial relief, he flew into an alcoholic rage, the report said.\n\n\u201cAll of his anger at being left to fend for himself and of having his safety net taken from him was then brought to bear on the victims,\u201d according to the report.\n\nCrutsinger was the 14th inmate put to death this year in the U.S. and the fifth in Texas, the nation\u2019s busiest capital punishment state. Ten more executions have been scheduled in Texas for this year.\n\nNo family members of Magouirk and Syren witnessed the execution. Crutsinger did not mention the two women during his final statement.\n\n\u201cThe defendant stabbed two elderly women to death in their own home. They had offered him a chance at honest work. The loss of mother and daughter Pearl Magouirk and Pat Syren is still felt deeply by their family and the Fort Worth community. Our sympathy and thoughts continue to be with them,\u201d Hartmann said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court had declined a request by Crutsinger\u2019s attorney to stop the execution. The lawyer had argued Crutsinger\u2019s previous attorney had a long history of incompetent work in death penalty cases.\n\n\u201cThe jury heard nothing from the defense that provided an explanation about the disease of alcoholism in relation to the offense conduct,\u201d including such things as \u201ca history of domestic violence and abuse, and repeated losses of significant friends and relatives,\u201d Lydia Brandt, Crutsinger\u2019s current attorney, wrote in her one of her Supreme Court petitions.\n\nBrandt also argued lower courts had wrongly denied Crutsinger funding to investigate competency and mental health claims that were not sufficiently reviewed by prior attorneys.\n\nLower appeals courts and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles also had declined to stop the execution.\n\nInvestigators said DNA evidence tied Crutsinger to the killings and he confessed.\n\nBrandt described Crutsinger\u2019s previous appellate lawyer, Richard Alley, as a \u201cgreat word processor\u201d who cut and pasted \u201cworthless\u201d legal arguments from other cases and who was removed from another death row client\u2019s case and suspended from practicing in federal court.\n\nBrandt alleged that Alley performed similar shoddy work in at least six other death penalty cases. Four of those inmates have been executed. An attorney for former death row inmate Bobby Woods also alleged incompetent work by Alley before Woods was executed in 2009.\n\nIn 2006, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals removed Alley from its list of lawyers eligible to represent death row inmates in their appeals. Alley died in 2017.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI do the best I possibly can on all these cases,\u201d Alley told the Austin American-Statesman in a 2006 story that was part of a series that looked at the bad work by court-appointed attorneys in appeals of death penalty cases.\n\nThe Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office called Crutsinger\u2019s allegations against Alley \u201cspeculative\u201d because he had not identified any claim that Alley should have raised but did not. The attorney general\u2019s office also said Crutsinger\u2019s case has received an \u201cextensive review\u201d during his appeals process.\n\nFox News' Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Texas death row inmate was executed Wednesday for stabbing\u00a0an 89-year-old woman at least seven times and her 71-year-old daughter at least nine times, killing them, after entering their Fort Worth home under the pretense of doing some work for them over 16 years ago.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
