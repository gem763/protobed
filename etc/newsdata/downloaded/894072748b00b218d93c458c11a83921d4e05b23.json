Lindsey Graham criticizing the maneuver as \"a disaster in the making\" in a rare public break with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria,\u201d the South Carolina Republican wrote on Twitter, adding that he was in the process of scheduling a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and warning: \u201cIf press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nGraham, a vocal defender of the president and frequent adviser on matters of foreign policy, predicted the administration's move would ensure a \u201ccomeback\u201d of ISIS, force the Kurds to align themselves with Syrian President Bashar Assad and Iran, damage the relationship between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government and Congress, and become \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d\n\nHe also threatened to introduce a Senate resolution opposing Trump's decision, and accused the White House of being dishonest about the nature of the ISIS threat during an interview on the president's favorite morning cable news show.\n\nTrump earlier Monday morning defended the dramatic policy shift, citing his long-standing call to extricate American forces from \u201cridiculous Endless Wars\u201d abroad.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lie being told by the administration [is] that ISIS is defeated,\u201d Graham told the hosts of \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we've made, thrown the region into further chaos,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI hope I'm making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is in my view.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, another hawkish lawmaker respected within the GOP for his foreign policy outlook, also condemned the White House's action and cautioned that it would encourage Iran amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and the Islamic Republic.\n\n\u201cIf reports about US retreat in #Syria are accurate, the Trump administration has made a grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria,\u201d the Florida Republican tweeted. \u201cIt would confirm #Iran\u2019s view of this administration & embolden then to escalate hostile attacks which in turn could trigger much broader & more dangerous regional war.\u201d\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called the move \u201ca catastrophic mistake,\" tweeting: \"This decision ignores lesson of 9/11. Terrorists thousands of miles away can and will use their safe-havens to launch attacks against America.\u201d\n\nNikki Haley, Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, issued a denunciation, as well.\n\n\u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier Monday morning defended the dramatic policy shift, citing his long-standing call to extricate American forces from \u201cridiculous Endless Wars\u201d abroad.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades,\u201d Trump wrote in a series of tweets. \u201cI held off this fight for ... almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced Turkey's planned invasion in a statement late Sunday that seemed to indicate at least tacit American support.\n\nThe statement said Trump spoke by phone with Erdogan about the military incursion, which the administration referred to as a \u201clong-planned operation\u201d without elaborating on the scope of the attack.\n\nTrump and Erdogan are to meet in Washington at some point in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2018 will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTurkey has been a U.S. ally in efforts to battle ISIS in the region \u2014 Syria being the location of much of the fighting because of the horrific chaos of its ongoing civil war \u2014 but there are complications to the alliance.\n\nKurdish soldiers had also been working with American forces in Syria, but Turkey regards those forces as its enemy. The Kurdish forces, which have been fighting for an independent homeland for Kurds, could be in serious jeopardy when Turkish troops sweep into the area.\n\nErdogan has expressed displeasure with the support the United States has given those Kurdish forces.\n\nThe White House used its statement to ding its European allies.\n\n\u201cThe United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused. The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer,\u201d it said. \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d\n\nTrump again lashed out at the Western powers Monday, charging that they took advantage of the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, ... including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cBut Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\u201d the president continued. \u201cI said 'NO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.' They ... again said 'NO,' thinking, as usual, that the U.S. is always the 'sucker,' on NATO, on Trade, on everything.\u201d\n\nTrump and Erdogan are to meet in Washington at some point in the coming weeks.\n\nThe president's eagerness for a hasty military withdrawal from Syria has long infuritated both Democratic and Republican members of Congress, as well as some senior members of his own executive branch. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned in December after Trump ordered all American troops to be pulled out of the West Asian country.\n\nBrett McGurk, the top U.S. envoy overseeing the effort to defeat ISIS, stepped down days after Mattis announced his departure, and excoriated the president on Twitter early Monday morning.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief,\u201d McGurk wrote. \u201cHe makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\u201d", "description": "Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Nikki Haley denounced the decision to allow Turkey to fight US-allied Kurds.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey", "David Cohen", "Ayla Jean Yackley"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174220183-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
