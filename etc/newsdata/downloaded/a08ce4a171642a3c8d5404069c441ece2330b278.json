REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaido in February attempted to bring U.S.-backed aid into Venezuela via Colombia against the wishes of President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government, which blocked the entrance of supplies in a violent standoff along the border.\n\nMaduro later gave permission to the International Federation of the Red Cross and the United Nations to provide hospitals with emergency supplies that included power plants, medicine and surgical gloves.\n\n\u201cDespite the improvement, in our opinion, there is not much stability,\u201d said Julio Castro, of Doctors for Health, which gathers data from employees in 40 Venezuelan public hospitals.\n\nEmergency rooms for the last six months have lacked around 50% of the supplies they need, he said.\n\nA lack of medicine, water and power outages, and the migration of personnel due to low wages, have crippled Venezuela\u2019s health sector.\n\nU.N. agencies this year provided 358 tonnes of medicine and supplies, Castro said, enough to provide treatment for as many as 3.5 million people.\n\nThe International Federation of the Red Cross as of August had delivered 100 tonnes of supplies, it said in a news release.\n\nCastro said aid groups have not provided a breakdown of how much aid reached each hospital or if any was distributed to Venezuela\u2019s 300 smaller public health clinics.\n\nA U.N. official said in response to questions that the United Nations works with a number of Venezuelan hospitals and provides aid through organizations that include the Pan American Health Organization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\n\nThe International Federation of the Red Cross and Venezuela\u2019s information ministry did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nGuaido, who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president, says the February aid effort boosted pressure on Maduro to allow aid into the country.\n\nHumanitarian relief groups had said that effort risked politicizing aid.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s government until this year had refused such aid on the grounds that the country was not in humanitarian crisis.\n\nCastro said that despite announcements by Russia and China about providing humanitarian aid, no follow-up information on aid from the two has been provided, making it impossible to evaluate its impact.", "description": "Humanitarian aid has led to a small improvement in the availability of medical supplies in Venezuelan emergency rooms, although shortages continue to plague public hospitals, non-governmental organization Doctors for Health said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428678809&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0XT-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
