Others were hoisted onto wheelchairs and pushed along a muddy shore on arrival by boat.\n\nHagibis smashed into the main Japanese island of Honshu on Saturday night as one of the most violent typhoons in recent years, with wind gusts of up to 216 kilometres (134 miles) per hour.\n\n- 'Please do your best' -\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storm claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver.\n\nLandslides and flooding took more lives overnight, and the toll climbed higher after sunrise on Sunday, as the scale of the devastation wrought by Hagibis became clear.\n\nBodies were retrieved from submerged homes and vehicles, from raging overflowing rivers, and from buildings buried in landslides.\n\nThe dead included a municipal worker whose car was overcome by floodwaters and two Chinese crew members aboard a boat that sank overnight in Tokyo Bay.\n\nFour of the crew were rescued, but authorities were still searching for another six.\n\n\"The government will do its utmost,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.\n\n\"Please do your best,\" he told a disaster management meeting.\n\nMore than 110,000 homes were still without power by Sunday evening, with others experiencing water outages.\n\nAt the storm's peak, more than seven million people were placed under non-compulsory evacuation orders.\n\nThe storm prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue its highest-level rain disaster warning, saying \"unprecedented\" downpours were expected.\n\n- 'I don't know where to start' -\n\n\"The water came up higher than my head in the house,\" Hajime Tokuda, a finance professional living in Kawasaki near Tokyo told AFP.\n\nHe moved to his family's home nearby, but that flooded too and they had to be rescued by boat.\n\nIn Saitama's Higashi Matsuyama city, northwest of Tokyo, rice and flower farmers were counting their losses, with water submerging warehouses full of freshly harvested produce.\n\n\"We never had a flood like this before in this neighbourhood,\" said one farmer, who declined to give his name.\n\n\"I don't know where to start cleaning this mess.\"\n\nThe storm brought travel chaos during a long holiday weekend in Japan, grounding flights and halting local and bullet train services.\n\nOn Sunday, train services began resuming and operations also slowly restarted at the two airports serving the capital, although many flights were cancelled.\n\nBut some lines remained halted, with aerial footage in Nagano showing rows of bullet trains partially submerged by flooding.\n\nThe storm also caused havoc for the sports world, delaying Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and forcing the cancellation of several Rugby World Cup matches.\n\nBut a crucial decider saw the home team reach the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time ever.\n\n\"To everyone that's suffering from the typhoon, this game was for you guys,\" said Japan captain Michael Leitch.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday said that he was \"saddened by reports of loss of life and extensive destruction\" caused by Hagibis, and extended his \"deep condolences to the families of the victims.\"", "description": "Tens of thousands of rescuers worked through the pre-dawn hours Monday to reach people trapped by landslides and floods in Japan caused by a powerful typhoon that has killed up to 35, officials and local media said.
