At least half a million people have entered Yang\u2019s basic income raffle.\n\nAlthough he called his idea \u201cunprecedented,\u201d that\u2019s not entirely true. It\u2019s a direct echo of the Townsend Plan, the brainchild of another political novice who also believed that the solution to economic disruption and automation almost a century ago was to guarantee an income.\n\nI wrote a book about that plan, the organization behind it and the man who promoted it throughout the country. I found that in times of economic insecurity, simple, straightforward guaranteed income proposals can be highly influential, even if they aren\u2019t ultimately adopted.\n\nTownsend\u2019s Income Guarantee\n\nIn 1934, Dr. Francis Everett Townsend was a 66-year-old unemployed physician living in Long Beach, California.\n\nHe claimed that when he saw older women rooting around in his trash for food, an idea hit him: The federal government should guarantee an income of $200 per month \u2013 about $3,700 today \u2013 for Americans 60 years and older who agreed to stop working. Not only would their money worries end, he reasoned, but their renewed consumer spending would jump-start the economy and their retirement would reduce competition for jobs.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Andrew Yang wants to give Americans $1,000 a month.", "authors": ["Edwin Amenta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sElZn5LWVAP1zamNpoH5tQ--~B/aD05MzA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b2205b4298e49a79501f3d7885c70f65", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
