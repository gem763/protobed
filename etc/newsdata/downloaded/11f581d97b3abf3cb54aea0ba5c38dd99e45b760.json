Speculation that Britain will avoid dropping out of the EU without a divorce accord lifted the pound last week to its biggest two-day gain in a decade.\n\n\u201cObviously this is the week in the run-up to the European council where there are a range of negotiations taking place even as we speak,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government\u2019s number one priority is to secure a deal and obviously then bring forward the legislation in parliament through votes and a legislative framework through a potential Withdrawal Agreement bill so we can get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nShe dismissed Labour\u2019s stance, describing Corbyn\u2019s rejection of the deal without knowing its contents as \u201cclearly playing politics.\u201d\n\nRees-Mogg Says Brexit Talks \u2018Take\u2019 More Serious Turn (08:10)\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Cabinet will be briefed at 12:45 p.m. London time after a more positive week in negotiations. Johnson will not undermine the integrity of the U.K. in his pursuit of a deal, he told Sky News.\n\nParliament can legislate quickly if required and \u201cendless extensions\u201d won\u2019t solve matters, he said.\n\nSeparately, Rees-Mogg sought to reassure hard line supporters of Brexit concerned about the content of his plans and who could prevent a Oct. 31 exit by refusing to support it. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said that \u201cas a Leaver, Boris can be trusted.\u201d\n\nJohnson, Corbyn Unfit to Lead Country, Swinson Says (07:55)\n\nSwinson reiterated the Liberal Democrats\u2019 desire to revoke Article 50 and said they would support amendments that bring the country closer to a second referendum on the issue. She told Sky that it was entirely possible that her party could win a majority at the next election.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Nigel Dodds has also rejected any Brexit solution that would weaken Northern Ireland\u2019s custom ties to the U.K., La Repubblica reported Saturday, citing an interview during a NATO conference in London.\n\nCorbyn to Look at Deal Before Triggering Election (07:40)\n\nCorbyn said he was unlikely to support any deal agreed by Johnson and would caution other lawmakers against doing so, but said his party would look at it before triggering a general election. If the Prime Minister fails to request an extension to talks in the absence of an agreement, Labour will take parliamentary action, he said in an interview on Sky News\u2019 Ridge on Sunday.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will brief his Cabinet later Sunday on progress toward his proposed Brexit deal, as opponents in parliament remain divided over their strategy to prevent Britain from crashing out of the European Union this month.Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said the", "authors": ["Lucy Meakin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
