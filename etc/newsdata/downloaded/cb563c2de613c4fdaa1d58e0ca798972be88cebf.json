The biggest reaction would be in dollar/yen, because you can't really buy the pound or the euro at the moment.\"\n\nTraders are also keeping an eye out on the Sino-U.S. trade development.

And if it\u2019s after the election, it\u2019ll be a deal like you\u2019ve never seen, it\u2019ll be the greatest deal ever and China knows that,\" Trump said.\n\nThe pair traded 0.1% lower at 7.0866.\n\nThe pair inched up 0.1% to 108.19. The yen was little moved by White House adviser Larry Kudlow\u2019s comments that Trump and his administration may formally announce a trade deal with Japan next week.\n\nThe pair slipped 0.1% to 1.2486 as sentiment remained weak amid uncertainty over Brexit.", "description": "Forex - USD Steadies Ahead of Fed Meeting;Yen Unmoved by Potential Japan-U.S. Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE6H00L_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
