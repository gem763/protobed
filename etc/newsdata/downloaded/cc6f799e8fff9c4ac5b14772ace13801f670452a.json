But some things Lori Alhadeff remembers. She remembers how she and her husband and sons tucked family pictures and a favorite pink teddy bear into the coffin before closing it, and how she kept her own fingers pressed against that coffin, even as it was being lowered into the ground. She does not remember screaming when it slipped, finally, from her reach. Friends later described the sound she made as unlike anything they had ever heard.\n\nBy then, Mrs. Alhadeff thinks, her daughter\u2019s spirit had already taken up residence inside of her.\n\nHow else to explain the distinct change she felt? Or her rapid conversion from reserved, bashful soccer mom into outspoken school safety advocate? Just hours after completing funeral arrangements, she had walked up to one of the cable news teams dotting the local park and asked for the camera to be turned on. \u201cI have something to say,\u201d she explained, before unleashing a raw, angry screed that would quickly go viral.\n\n\u201cOur kids need safety now,\u201d she screamed. \u201cDo something!\u201d\n\nMrs. Alhadeff had never been one to yell. It was Alyssa whose voice always carried; Alyssa who was known as \u201cthe smallest girl\u201d on her soccer team with \u201cthe loudest voice.\u201d It was also Alyssa who loved to join and participate and compete, and Alyssa whose persistence and sharp negotiating skills made a lifetime of victories seem so assured.", "description": "As have other parents whose children were shot down at school, Lori Alhadeff is fighting for change.", "authors": ["Jeneen Interlandi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/opinion/20parkland3/20parkland3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
