It also veers from concrete realism to a fractured blend of dream and memory.\n\nSaul Adler is a physically beautiful, vain, and self-absorbed young historian of totalitarianism and the psychology of male tyrants. As the novel opens, he is about to leave London for East Germany in 1988 to do research on cultural resistance to Nazism, his professional specialty. In a novel that unfolds like an experimental film, with flashbacks and flash-forwards, it gradually becomes clear how deeply entwined those interests are with Adler\u2019s personal relationships\u2014and how much more fraught those relationships are than he recognizes.\n\nLevy is intrigued by the ways in which history and family history can echo each other. She gives Adler a background that brings geopolitical dramas home, quite literally, for him. His Jewish mother, born in Germany, had \u201cused her body like a human wall\u201d to protect him against violence and derision from the male side of the family, a bullying brother and a purist Bolshevik father\u2014a man who continued to believe in communism even after the tanks rolled into Prague in 1968. With his mother\u2019s death in a car accident when he was 12, Adler\u2019s rare beauty, along with what they sensed was his fluid sexuality, invited their brutality.\n\nHe only gradually becomes aware of how cut off from others, and from his own feelings, this past has left him. An abrupt breakup instigated by his girlfriend\u2014a photographer named Jennifer Moreau, who will go on to become famous\u2014sets the disorienting process in motion. Moreau loves Adler\u2019s body, his \u201crock-star looks,\u201d his \u201cintense black hair and even more intense blue eyes,\u201d and loves to photograph him. He is her muse, in the sort of upending of gender expectations that Levy likes to explore. This time the man chafes at being objectified; Adler resents the thought that she might love him for his body, not his mind. In turn, Moreau accuses him of selfish detachment. Their paths diverge, yet they become \u201cspecters\u201d (the word recurs again and again) who haunt each other, and for a reason neither of them knows as he leaves for East Germany, she won\u2019t vanish from his life.\n\nIn the world of the novel, specters multiply and never truly depart. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\u2019s infamous specter haunting Europe (the opening lines of The Communist Manifesto) is just the backdrop. Close surveillance\u2014as historical-political fact and as metaphor\u2014seems to be a constant, too, sowing deception and undermining trust. Moreau\u2019s camera lens had been omnipresent during their relationship. In East Berlin, the Stasi violates every corner of people\u2019s private lives. There Adler falls in love with a man and then a woman. Effortlessly crossing boundaries in his love affairs, Adler aspires to be a conduit to the freedom he presumes his new partners want, only to discover that he\u2019s been an unwitting betrayer rather than a liberator.", "description": "The British novelist\u2019s wry books veer from concrete realism to fractured blends of dream and memory.", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio", "Deborah Levy"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/levy_cover-1/facebook.jpg?1570730238", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
