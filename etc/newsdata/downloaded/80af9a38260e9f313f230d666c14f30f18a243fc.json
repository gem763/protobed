But it was the lack of an American military response to the strikes on Saudi oil facilities that appeared to have created an opening.\n\n\u201cThere are cracks in the armor suggesting Saudi Arabia is interested in exploring a new relationship with Iran,\u201d said Philip Gordon, a former White House coordinator for the Middle East. \u201cThe worst outcome for the Saudis is to move to a confrontation with Iran expecting the U.S. to support them and find out they won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis administration has shown it\u2019s not really ready to take on Iran.\u201d\n\nTop officials from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, Saudi allies which could suffer if open conflict broke out, have spoken publicly of the need for diplomacy to reduce tensions and have made their own efforts to reach out to Iran. The Emirates has held direct maritime security talks with Iran, and has pulled back from the war in Yemen, where it is allied with the Saudis in a battle against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia joins Kuwait and the Emirates in reaching out to Iran, it could undermine the Trump administration\u2019s effort to build an international coalition to ostracize and pressure the Iranians.\n\n\u201cThe anti-Iran alliance is not just faltering, it\u2019s crumbling,\u201d Martin Indyk, the executive vice president of Brookings Institution and a former senior diplomat, said Thursday on Twitter. \u201cMBZ has struck his deal with Iran; MBS is not far behind,\u201d he said, referring to the Emirati crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed, or MBZ, and the Saudi crown prince, known as MBS.\n\nHe also noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s most hawkish anti-Iran adviser, John R. Bolton, had left the administration, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is fighting for his political life and Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to talk directly to the Iranians.", "description": "Weeks after the Middle East seemed on the verge of war, Saudi Arabia and Iran are seeking ways to ease tensions.
