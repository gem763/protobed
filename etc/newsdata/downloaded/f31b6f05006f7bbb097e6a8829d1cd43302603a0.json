U.S. intelligence officials were able to \u201cscope out\u201d his exact location two weeks ago, while Trump himself became aware of the planned raid three days ago. As part of the plan, the United States had to secure permission from Russia, Iraq and Turkey to fly over their airspace, according to Trump and National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien. Trump said the White House did not disclose the nature of the operation to Russia, but told Russian officials they would \u201clike\u201d it.\n\n* On Saturday, Trump arrived back at the White House at around 4:30 p.m. local time (10:30pm in Syria) after a round of golf in Virginia, according to his official schedule. At around 5 pm, he gathered in the White House Situation Room with Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, and other intelligence officials. They watched the raid unfold live \u201cas if you were watching a movie,\u201d said Trump.\n\n* Moments after they gathered, U.S. military personnel and military dogs lifted-off in eight helicopters from an unidentified military base in the Middle East, according to Trump. The personnel came from the Delta Force, one of the U.S. special units mainly focused on counter-terrorism and often deployed to capture high-value targets. A U.S. official told Reuters the operation was staged from an airbase in western Iraq. The on-the-ground operation in the Idlib region of Syria was supported by military aircraft and ships, said Trump. The operatives were also equipped with a military robot but did not ultimately use it.\n\n* Upon approaching Baghdadi\u2019s compound, the helicopters came under gunfire but U.S. forces were able to quickly suppress the assault and land safely. Believing the main compound door to be booby trapped, they entered in just seconds by blasting through the wall, said Trump. \u201cWe were getting full reports on a minute-by-minute basis,\u201d he added.\n\n* U.S. forces quickly cleared the compound \u201cwith people either surrendering or being shot and killed,\u201d said Trump. Eleven children were removed, uninjured, and taken into care by a third party whom the president declined to name. U.S. soldiers captured and later imprisoned several Islamic State fighters.\n\n* Baghdadi fled into a subterranean area of the complex and into a tunnel, dragging three of his young children with him. Esper told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday that U.S. forces called for Baghdadi to surrender but the world\u2019s most wanted man refused. Chased by the dogs and confronted by a dead end, Baghdadi - \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming,\u201d according to Trump - ignited his suicide vest, killing himself and his children and causing the tunnel to collapse. No military personnel were hurt although one dog was badly injured.\n\nPeople are seen near damaged al-Nouri mosque, where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared his caliphate back in 2014, in the old city of Mosul, Iraq, October 27, 2019.

It was him,\u201d said Trump. Speaking on NBC News\u2019 Meet The Press with Chuck Todd on Sunday, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe were in the Situation Room. And the commander of the mission called and said, \u2018100% confidence, jackpot.\u201d\n\n* The soldiers proceeded to search the compound, taking \u201chighly sensitive material\u201d including information on Islamic State\u2019s origins and its future plans. In total, U.S. forces were in the compound for around two hours before flying back out via the same route they flew in.\n\n* Baghdadi\u2019s body will be \u201cdisposed of properly,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that he expected it to be the same protocol followed in 2011 for Osama bin Laden.
