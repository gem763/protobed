There are so much better climbers out there who (haven\u2019t) got the opportunity,\u201d he told AFP in Kathmandu.\n\n\u201cInternational attention and sponsors rush easily towards foreign climbers but Nepalis don\u2019t get such opportunities.\u201d\n\nBorn in a small village in western Nepal, Purja joined two older brothers in the Gurkhas \u2014 a unit of Nepalis recruited into the British army \u2014 in his late teens, serving in the military for 16 years, including with the elite Special Boat Service.\n\nWhile in the military, Purja summited Everest, the world\u2019s highest peak at 8,848 metres, and Lhotse (8,516 metres) in a record 10 hours and 15 minutes in 2017.\n\nHe then turned his sights on conquering the so-called 8,000-ers \u2014 but with a twist. He would attempt the feat in months, not years.\n\n\u2013 Seven months, 14 peaks \u2013\n\nSince legendary Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner first completed the 8,000-ers \u2014 without supplementary oxygen \u2014 in 1986, some 39 climbers have achieved the feat.\n\nSouth Korean Kim Chang-ho holds the record without bottled oxygen, which he achieved in seven years, 10 months and six days.\n\nPolish climber Jerzy Kukuczka\u2019s seven years, 11 months and 14 days is the fastest with oxygen, and it is this record that Purja is chasing.\n\nPurja faced hurdles from the beginning. When he first told others about his new quest, \u201ceveryone was laughing at me and saying \u2018how it will be possible\u2019?\u201d.\n\nDetractors told him each mountain would take two months to summit, and he would need good weather and time to recover.\n\nBut confident of his abilities, Purja set out on his quest, working hard to secure the funding needed for the missions.\n\nPurja climbed Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu \u2014 among the highest of peaks \u2014 in just one month in the first part of his record attempt.\n\nThe day he summited Everest this year, he also captured a notorious human traffic jam at the peak in a photograph that went around the world.\n\nA month later, he headed to Pakistan for the second part, sprinting up and down five of Pakistan\u2019s highest peaks including the treacherous K2 and Nanga Parbat, within a month.\n\nPurja began his final push in September, reaching the tops of Cho Oyu and Manaslu within a week.\n\nHe is proud of what he has achieved, which includes setting several speed climbing records.\n\n\u201cIt is about trusting your ability,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou always need to have (a) positive mindset because sometimes things will go wrong, (but)\u2026 you can make impossible the possible.\u201d", "description": "Kathmandu (AFP) \u2013 For pioneering Nepali mountaineer Nirmal Purja, on track to finish climbing the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains in a record", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/74a1a5_nepali-mountaineer-nirmal-purja-is-aiming-fastest-man-climb-world-14-highest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
