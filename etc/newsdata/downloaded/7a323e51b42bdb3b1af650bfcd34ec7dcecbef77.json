He is expecting the birth of his first child in two weeks and said it\u2019s been \u201ca distraction because my head\u2019s back home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this week I told myself, \u2018Dude, this is your last tournament before you become a dad. Do something with it,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMalnati, who managed a first-round 69 after missing the cut in his last two tournaments, teed off early in what he called \u201csummertime\u201d conditions, humid and dead calm before bad weather suspended play for over two hours. He took advantage with three birdies and an eagle. A couple of underwhelming wedge shots may have cost him back-nine birdies.\n\n\u201cI got to play the first five holes in perfect conditions and really took advantage of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI then came back out and was able to keep the momentum going. To make no bogeys in the conditions we played is really more than I could have ever hoped for. I played the last 13 holes wishing I had hand-warmers. The wind was certainly a two or three club wind.\u201d\n\nAlthough his wife, Alicia, isn\u2019t due for another two weeks, he conceded he\u2019s already \u201cfully on call.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has all the media officials phone numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she has to come get me off the course, she will.\u201d\n\nOnly four of the top 10 players on the leaderboard have completed 36 holes. Sepp Straka is in at 8-under, and Carlos Ortiz and Mark Hubbard are 7-under. Straka is tied with Nick Watney (14 holes) and Lanto Griffin (13)\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Expectant father Peter Malnati started strong and shot 7-under 65 Friday to lead at the Houston Open after morning rain and lightning prevented the second round from being completed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/houston_open_golf_53410_c0-198-3000-1948_s1200x700.jpg?1c84ea08ff9dac08606d6399a26c70e0b1d6e75e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
