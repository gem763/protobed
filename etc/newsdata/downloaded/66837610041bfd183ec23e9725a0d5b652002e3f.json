Both are urging the president to back new firearms restrictions \u2014 including expanded background checks for gun sales \u2014 insisting he can be the leader who succeeds on an intractable issue that has bedeviled his predecessors and that he can win back moderate suburban voters in the process, according to people involved in the discussions.\n\nOn the other side, a group that includes Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son and an avid hunter, and a top aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, is telling Trump he risks losing support from his conservative base if he pushes too aggressively on new gun control legislation, they say\u2026\n\nThe competing forces have created paralysis with just about everybody involved in the discussions \u2014 most notably senators \u2014 and have delayed the White House\u2019s release of its long-awaited package, possibly jeopardizing the effort to enact meaningful legislation following this summer\u2019s mass shootings that claimed dozens of lives.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
