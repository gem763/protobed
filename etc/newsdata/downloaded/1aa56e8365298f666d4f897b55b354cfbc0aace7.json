Usually, these adverse reactions are caused by the active ingredients\u2014the components that cause the medication to have a therapeutic impact on your health.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t normally hear much about bad reactions to the inactive ingredients. While they\u2019re far more rare, they do happen\u2026and in some cases they can be life threatening.\n\nDrug \u201cAnatomy\u201d\n\nInactive ingredients in drugs may seem unnecessary, but most really do serve a purpose. For instance, artificial sweeteners help to mask a bitter or unpleasant taste. Fatty acids aid in absorption. Sugars like lactose act as binding agents. Vitamins like E help to extend shelf life. And that\u2019s just the beginning\u2026\n\nIn a recently published study, researchers concluded that the typical pill contains nine inactive ingredients\u2014though some have up to an astounding 35! According to one of the study authors, on average, 75 percent of the ingredients in medications are inactive.1\n\nThe Risks of Inactive Ingredients\n\nIn theory, this shouldn\u2019t be much of a concern, especially considering the typically miniscule dosage of inactive ingredients in one pill compared to your body weight. So, if you\u2019re taking just one tiny prescription tablet a day, chances are you have nothing to worry about.\n\nHowever, the reality in this country is that most people take more than one medication. A study published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings found that 70 percent of Americans take at least one prescription drug, 50 percent take two, and 20 percent take five or more.2\n\nObviously, the more medications you\u2019re on, the more inactive ingredients you\u2019re swallowing. Likewise, the risk of suffering an adverse reaction to inactive ingredients spikes as the number of pills you take increases. And the doses can really add up. The researchers discovered that those taking 10 drugs per day ingest, on average, 3 grams of inactive ingredients. That\u2019s roughly half a teaspoon!\n\nAgain, for a lot of people, this isn\u2019t problematic. But for those who have an allergy or intolerance to a certain additive, it certainly can be.\n\nIngredients of Concern\n\nWhen it comes to risk of reactions, the most worrisome ingredients are gluten, dyes, and lactose and other sugars.\n\nFifty-five percent of oral medications contain at least one sugar (lactose, mannitol, and polydextrose most commonly)\u2014and 65 percent of the population has difficulty digesting these substances, especially lactose. Symptoms include gastrointestinal upset such as bloating, diarrhea, and stomach pain.\n\nSome reactions can also border on life threatening. Thirty-eight inactive ingredients, like corn starch, peanut oil, gluten, and dyes, are potential allergens.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nAnyone with a serious peanut allergy could risk anaphylactic shock or even death if taking a drug with even a hint of peanut oil in it.\n\nAnd swallowing just one pill that contains miniscule amounts of gluten could trigger an immune attack in a celiac sufferer, causing inflammation, headache, hives, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and even malnutrition.\n\nWhat You Should Do\n\nIf you are taking a medication\u2014or even multiple medications\u2014without any symptoms, side effects, or adverse reactions, then you likely have nothing to worry about.\n\nHowever, if you are concerned about inactive ingredients\u2014whether it\u2019s due to adverse reactions you\u2019ve experienced or other reasons\u2014there are a couple of things you can do to become more educated and informed.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s always a good idea to read through the package insert that comes with your medication. Most people don\u2019t\u2014but you really should. Yes, a lot of it is technical and boring mumbo-jumbo. But there\u2019s also a good deal of important info about the drug that could benefit you, including active and inactive ingredients, side effects, contraindications, dosing information, what to do if you overdose, how and where to properly store it, and more.\n\nSecond, visit Pillbox. Run by the National Library of Medicine, Pillbox is one of the largest free online databases that pulls information from multiple sources\u2014pharmaceutical companies, FDA, National Institutes of Health, and more\u2014to provide consumers everything they need to know about a certain drug.\n\nIf you find that a medication you take regularly has an inactive ingredient that you are worried about, or that you know is causing you some type of distress, talk to your doctor. There is most likely an alternative that is just as effective but uses different inactive ingredients.\n\nFinally, it may be worth discussing with your doctor if you actually need to be taking all the meds you\u2019ve been prescribed. Perhaps there is a natural alternative. Or maybe there is a newer generation pill that can replace multiple drugs. The fewer meds you take, the lower the risk for reactions to inactive ingredients.\n\nAlways remember though, before discontinuing the use of any drugs, talk to your doctor. In the case of many medications, stopping abruptly can cause way more harm to your health than the inactive ingredients cause. It\u2019s important to wean properly.\n\nReferences\n\nCaution: Side effects may NOT be caused by your medication\n\nWe tend to hear about the possible side effects of drugs through ads, doctors, and word of mouth.
