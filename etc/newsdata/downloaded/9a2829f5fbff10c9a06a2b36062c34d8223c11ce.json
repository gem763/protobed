A court sentenced 16 people to death for her murder.", "language": "en", "text": "The mob came for her, according to prosecutors, because the teen had defied the protocol of her small, conservative village 100 miles outside the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka. When the headmaster of her Islamic school touched her inappropriately without her consent, she refused to stay silent \u2014 and instead reported the assault to police.\n\nAD\n\nThe headmaster, Maulana Siraj Ud Doula, was taken into custody.\n\nBut Rafi\u2019s statement, recorded on video, was leaked to the public, sparking outrage, protests and harassment of the teenager. To protect Rafi, her brother escorted her to school for two days, reported the Daily Star. On day three, he was blocked at the entrance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn\u2019t allowed to enter,\u201d Rafi\u2019s brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman, told the BBC in April. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been stopped, something like this wouldn\u2019t have happened to my sister.\u201d\n\nLater that day, Rafi was lured to the roof of the school by a female student, reported BBC Bengali. There, a group of four or five students wearing burqas, glasses and gloves to conceal their identities demanded that Rafi retract her accusations against the headmaster. When she refused, authorities said, the group held her down and lit her on fire.\n\nAD\n\nPolice Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder told BBC Bengali that the mob wanted \u201cto make it look like a suicide.\"\n\nRafi escaped their grasp, sought help and was taken to a local hospital, reported the BBC. When they could not treat her severe injuries, she was transferred to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. On the way, she recorded a statement on her brother\u2019s cellphone.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe teacher touched,\u201d she says, according to the BBC. \u201cI will fight this crime until my last breath.\u201d\n\nShe died April 10, and thousands of people attended her funeral.\n\nNow, six months later, the headmaster who assaulted her and 15 others convicted of crimes related to her murder have been sentenced to death. Authorities said in court documents that Rafi\u2019s murder was ordered by the principal.\n\nAD\n\nTwo female classmates, three teachers and two local leaders of the ruling Awami League party were among those charged and convicted, reported BBC.\n\n\u201cThe judgment proves that no one is above the law,\u201d public prosecutor Hafez Ahmed told reporters after the court verdict, according to Reuters.\n\nThe defendants will challenge the verdict in the High Court, their attorney, Giasuddin Nannu, told Reuters.\n\nExecutions in Bangladesh are most commonly carried out by hanging, according to a global death penalty database maintained by Cornell Law School. At the end of 2018, at least 1,500 people were under a pending death sentence in the country, which has a population of 156 million people, according to the database.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRafi\u2019s family welcomed the death sentences and asked that they be carried out quickly.\n\nThey still fear for their own safety and continue to mourn Rafi.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t forget her for a moment,\u201d the girl\u2019s mother, Shirin Akhtar, told Reuters. \u201cI still feel the pain that she went through.\u201d\n\nRafi\u2019s death has sparked a national and global conversation about sexual assault in Bangladesh and the forces that keep victims of abuse from speaking out.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights group Mahila Parishad has reported that 26 women were killed after being sexually assaulted, 592 were raped and 113 were gang-raped in the first six months of 2019 in Bangladesh, according to BBC.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Nusrat Jahan Rafi's final act brought global attention to sexual assault in Bangladesh and the forces that keep victims from speaking out.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M_Bhfq-ubHOit-gOP86igwk-TfI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SHDWBUXWLII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
