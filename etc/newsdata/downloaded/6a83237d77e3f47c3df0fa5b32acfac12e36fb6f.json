The distraction of an impeachment fight isn\u2019t helping.\n\n\u201cWith the impeachment and the Syria issue, I think Republicans are less interested in protecting the president than they were a few months ago,\u201d Rep. John Garamendi, California Democrat, said in an interview.\n\nThe Kurds have a number of strong advocates on Capitol Hill and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are a key American ally in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Garamendi, who chairs the House Armed Services readiness subcommittee, said the situation \u201cis a very profoundly troubling situation.\u201d\n\nThe pushback to Mr. Trump\u2019s move has opened the door to adding sanctions on Turkey to the 2020 defense policy bill for the attacks, which have caused thousands of civilians in the area to flee.\n\nMr. Trump on Friday threatened to impose \u201cvery significant\u201d sanctions on Ankara over the Turkish military\u2019s bombardment of Kurds in northeast Syria, but the penalties have yet to be enforced.\n\nMr. Garamendi is sponsoring an amendment that prohibits the sale of F-35 aircraft to Ankara while Turkey remains in possession of the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system, and he has received bipartisan support.\n\nLawmakers are returning to Washington after a two-week fall break and are racing to pass the massive defense policy bill, which missed a major deadline at the beginning of the month.\n\nRetired Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr, director of the Center for National Defense at The Heritage Foundation, said that while the impeachment inquiry may not derail negotiations, \u201cit makes it harder for everybody else to come together.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmotions are high. [There are] levels of toxicity, if you will, that would not normally have been there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe annual National Defense Authorization Act sets spending levels and addresses a wide range of security policy issues. The Senate Republican majority and the Democrat-run House are far apart on a number of key issues.\n\nWith Mr. Trump having made both a priority, a spending hike for the military and funding for the Mexico border wall top the list.\n\nRepublicans in both chambers have been pushing for a $750 billion defense budget that is in line with former Defense Secretary James Mattis\u2019 suggestion to increase the funds by 3% to 5% each year to maintain readiness.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have argued that even the $738 billion for defense that was approved by both the House and Senate in July after the appropriations committees settled on the figure, is too much.\n\nBoth sides should expect to give a little, Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told The Washington Times in July.\n\n\u201cI suspect what will ultimately happen it is \u2026 the number will be cut in half, and that will be the number \u2014 a classic compromise,\u201d Mr. Garamendi said.\n\nThe border wall funding debate may not be as easy to finesse after Mr. Trump declared a national emergency and dipped into Pentagon funds earlier this year to underwrite construction work on his promised barrier.\n\nHouse Democrats are \u201cdetermined to severely limit the president\u2019s authority to use an emergency declaration to appropriate money for his pet projects,\u201d Mr. Garamendi said.\n\nHouse Democrats say they are set on having \u201cvery strict language\u201d in the National Defense Authorization Act that would prohibit the administration from using defense funds to construct and maintain the border wall, and they may find some Republican sympathy.\n\nGen. Spoehr said the issue \u201cmight be something [Republicans] might be willing to kind of diverge on from the White House\u201d because it is not a traditional branch of national defense.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper lamented again Friday the failure of Congress to pass a defense appropriations bill. He said it was hard for the Pentagon to make plans when dealing with a string of continuing funding resolutions.\n\nBut observers say the defense appropriations debate is at an impasse and may need senior leaders in both houses to have any hope of deal.\n\n\u201cThe appropriations process has been on life support for some time since it became obvious that the House was not coming off their insistence on limitations on the border wall,\u201d Bill Greenwalt, longtime Senate Armed Services Committee staffer, told the online publication Breaking Defense.\n\nThe continuing resolution for defense, which Mr. Trump signed last month, expires Nov. 21.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
