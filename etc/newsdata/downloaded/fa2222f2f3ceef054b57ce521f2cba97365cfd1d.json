By Tuesday, he could resist no longer. As we enter another \u2018now or never\u2019 week, will we ever escape this rabbit hole?\n\nI had begun last week with a determination to avoid Brexit. Or at least to stick to some kind of personal Brexit diet: either a spartan, fact-based Brexit-Atkins plan, or maybe a four-days-on, three-days-off regime. It was not the first time in the past couple of years that I\u2019d made that resolution. Like many of us, on all sides, I felt jaded by the same questions and the same answers, sated with vitriol, numbed by non-negotiation. I had heard of people who had gone whole weeks without discussing with their kids or their colleagues the removal of the backstop and its implications for the Good Friday agreement, but, in honesty, I didn\u2019t believe they existed.\n\nIn this spirit I set out on Monday morning to make a point of listening to music rather than news. I used my lunch hour to read a novel rather than Brexit commentary. I deleted the Twitter app from my phone. I wouldn\u2019t, I resolved, give the noise and nonsense any more attention, perhaps until the EU summit \u2013 perhaps, with any luck, until Halloween.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, inevitably, I was suckered back in by an overheard mention of Dominic Cummings\u2019s unguarded strategy briefing to the Spectator. I could not resist Googling. And then, of course, there was the thuggish racism of the Leave.EU poster about world wars and krauts, and I was back composing outraged tweet-lines in my head, admonishing myself for taking the bait, a lost cause.\n\nBy Friday, like the abstemious Lenten nobleman in the film Chocolat, who ends up gorging on prohibited Easter eggs in the chocolate shop window, I found myself back again at something like peak Brexit. I happened to be down near Parliament Square, mooching among bedraggled tourists and aimless pockets of Extinction rebels and drenched Ode to Joy pipers and St George flag wavers. I stepped into a cafe out of the rain and disappeared down another Brexit rabbit hole for an hour or two. It began with a clip of Question Time: an exchange between Theo Paphitis off Dragons\u2019 Den and an audience member voicing the angry beliefs that she both \u201cknew what she had voted for\u201d and that \u201cnobody knows what\u2019s going to happen\u201d.\n\nThen I was watching, one after another, the 11 Brexit \u201cexplainer\u201d videos tweeted out by Andrea Leadsom, each one a mesmerising catalogue of the freedoms we are collectively dying in a ditch to discard. As I was watching, a text happened to come through on my phone, announcing that \u201cpassport validity rules will change after Brexit\u201d and I needed to look up the new restrictions. From there, it was only a few Google steps into the back catalogue of Cummings\u2019s blog archive \u2013 not the recent, pithy, government one-liners but the impacted, self-mythologising screeds about how the referendum was won and how \u201cthe systemic and consistent dysfunction of establishment decision-making systems over a long period, with very poor mechanisms for good, accurate feedback from reality, created the space for a guerrilla operation to exploit\u201d. Or: how I used technology and behavioural science to create division by manipulating fears about immigration.\n\nA small part of most of us perhaps wonders how we might replace Brexit's spectacle of uncertainty and extremism when it is over\n\nThe trigger for that latest restless effort to make some sense of things, to get a grip, was Thursday\u2019s news that, after three-and-a-half years, the government had identified \u201ca pathway\u201d that might yet lead to \u201ca deal\u201d. Forget about the fact that the unknown concessions would, by any account, make the nation significantly worse off and likely dissolve the union, this shift in \u201cmood music\u201d was apparently a cause for hope. The pound surged, though it was hard not to latch on to the twin qualifiers in the announcement: \u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u201d The politicians hadn\u2019t set off on the grail quest. But they had identified the place it might start from if they did.\n\nTalking earlier this week about his brief Brexit fable, The Cockroach, in which the prime minister\u2019s body is taken over by a giant insect, Ian McEwan noted that, as a nation, \u201cwe have moved into a mystical realm\u201d when it comes to Brexit, somewhere murky and surreal. That land was divided along many lines, he suggested, but one of the primary ones was between those \u201cwho are junkies for this stuff and those who just want to get it done\u201d.\n\nIt was a nice distinction but I wasn\u2019t quite convinced. It seemed to me, a haggard veteran of vox pops and call-ins, that all sides \u2013 even the \u201cget-it-dones\u201d \u2013 were now equally in thrall to Brexit\u2019s spectacle of uncertainty and extremism, to the bruisers\u2019 politics it has engendered. A small part of most of us perhaps wonders how we might replace it when it is over; a much larger part fears it never will be.\n\nAs any student of addiction knows, hits must get stronger for the craving to be satisfied. In Brexit terms, that means ever more layers of manufactured complexity and false hope in pursuit of a deal that will satisfy nobody. One thing that Boris Johnson understands is that the old tropes are not enough to engage attention. \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d will no longer cut it. He needs to keep spouting oddness \u2013 \u201cpitchforking the incubus off our backs\u201d and so on \u2013 because his premiership is based entirely on his ability to offer new kinds of slapstick distraction.\n\nIn this endeavour he saves most of the best lines for himself. In his novella, McEwan was able to quote a speech of Johnson\u2019s verbatim, an unhinged fantasy about an unfettered Britain that was home to the electric aeroplane; satire was already priced in. Meanwhile the foot soldiers of the cabinet are tasked with remembering their few sanctioned phrases. Seasoned Brexit watchers \u2013 by which I mean all of us \u2013 could predict the majority of them before they are uttered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anti-Brexit demonstrators hold placards with the faces of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and his \u2018devilish\u2019 chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Photograph: Isabel Infantes/Getty\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t benefit anyone to have a running commentary on live negotiations,\u201d was one of the lines put out by the hapless education minister Gavin Williamson on Friday morning, before being echoed by others. Meanwhile it was noted that the pause in conversation between the British and Irish leaders allowed \u201ca period of reflection\u201d as to next steps. The nation, as ever, was left to ponder what either of those phrases might mean. That Johnson had developed a plan so subtle in its tracery that it would not bear the light of day? That a meditative safe space was essential to creating a plan for beyond the end of the month?\n\nAs ever there were one or two new coinages designed to frame the drama. \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d was rolled out as the phrase to describe the emergency session of parliament on October 19 at which a deal or an absence of a deal will be addressed. The Tory MP Nigel Evans repeated this phrase with the dedication of a promoter drawing attention to the latest pay-per-view cage fight.\n\nLeaving the EU was always going to be an interminable process, not a singular event, but that has never stopped its cheerleaders persisting with fake promises of a brisk final act. Once again, then, we are about to enter a \u201cnow or never\u201d week, and we will be invited to go through the motions of believing in the possibility of climax \u2013 until we are not. There have been many other crisis weeks. Each promised to be the beginning of the end. None proved to be close to the end of the beginning.\n\nIn his lazy bestseller The Churchill Factor, Johnson dwelt on the few dramatic moments in which his hero changed the course of history, attempting to associate his own flaky character with Churchill\u2019s indomitable will. In thinking about the coming week, the prime minister is deluded enough to have in mind the image of Churchill facing down a rebellious party minded to negotiate with Hitler, and his \u201cdarkest hour\u201d speech, which concluded: \u201cIf this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.\u201d\n\nThe country is so energised by the prospect of liberation from the EU that productivity is falling at the fastest pace for five years\n\nThe intent of Johnson\u2019s \u201csurrender act\u201d and \u201cdo or die\u201d is a shaming echo of that rhetoric. His emergency Saturday parliament is another effort to shackle the crisis of his own making to previous notable occasions when parliament had weekend sittings: at the outbreak of the war in 1939, for the Suez Crisis in 1956 and on the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. None of those previous threats to the nation was a homegrown invention. Unlike Churchill (or Eden or Thatcher), Johnson, would \u2013 in continuing to countenance a no-deal Brexit \u2013 have his country suffer an economic and social blitz simply to demonstrate that he has a semblance of spirit.\n\nIf this is his personal plan it feels more than ever like a by-product of a wider philosophy. In his blogs, Cummings dwells on some of his own heroes, those cross-disciplinary \u201csynthesisers\u201d, with their \u201ccool Thucydidean courage to face reality\u201d. His most recent long missive argues that \u201cwhat is happening now is a once in a 50- or 100-year crisis and such crises also are the waves that can be ridden to change things normally unchangeable\u201d. His aim appears to be to surf the current \u201ccreative chaos\u201d in the belief it might beach government in a technocratic future in which policy and strategy are dictated by an elite \u201cRed Team\u201d in his own image. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to create a wave and it\u2019s much easier to ride one,\u201d he notes.\n\nIn this realm of deliberate turbulence, in the name of future efficiencies, billions of pounds continue to be squandered to prepare for a no-deal exit that the courts and parliament have agreed cannot happen. Meanwhile, the government reneges on its promise to settled EU nationals by threatening deportations, and pledges to reward expatriate citizens with six months of healthcare when a lifetime of provision was once guaranteed. And the country is so energised by the prospect of liberation from the European Union that the productivity of its workforce is falling at the fastest pace for five years, and remains drastically below the EU average.\n\nSurveys of the nation\u2019s psychological health catch the effects of those figures. The latest revealed that around four in 10 people \u2013 22 million \u2013 reported feeling powerless (43%), angry (39%) or anxious (38%) because of Brexit in the last year. An LSE study which examined data from 35,000 people found significant increased levels of \u201cmental distress\u201d post-referendum that showed \u201cno significant difference\u201d between Remainers and Leavers.\n\nWhere will it end? The news, as I write this, offers the promise that the EU27 have given \u201cthe green light for Brexit talks to move to the \u2018tunnel\u2019 phase\u201d. There is debate about whether that means negotiations are actually \u201centering the tunnel\u201d, or whether intensified discussions are to prepare for \u201cpossibly entering the tunnel\u201d. And so we approach another week, employing more millions of collective hours and days of attention and emotion discovering if we are yet in the dark, and being fed our daily bread of catchphrase and half-truth, waiting for what comes next.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Theresa May, then UK prime minister, with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, in 2017, when it seemed a deal could be achieved.
