U.S. gold futures were up 0.1% to $1,506.70 per ounce.\n\n\u201cAll eyes are on the Fed meeting now, but what investors are really looking forward to is some clarity on whether the central bank will continue to remain dovish for the rest of this year,\u201d said John Sharma, an economist with National Australia Bank, adding that the current take on gold is \u201cwait and see\u201d.\n\nThe Fed is scheduled to meet on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, with traders seeing a 90.4% chance for a 25 basis point rate cut, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool. The U.S. central bank has already lowered interest rates twice this year.\n\n\u201cGains (if the Fed cut rates this week) may be limited as trade tensions are not as tense as they were over the summer,\u201d AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes said in a note.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last week said the U.S. was doing very well in its trade negotiations with China and that China wants to make a deal \u201cvery badly.\u201d\n\nThe remarks boosted investors\u2019 appetite for riskier assets, sending Asian shares to a three-month high on Monday.\n\nBoth U.S. and China have imposed a series of tit-for-tat tariffs over the past 15 months, stirring global recessionary fears and driving gold prices over 17% higher this year, but the recent development has put a lid on the yellow metal\u2019s gain.\n\nHowever, NAB\u2019s Sharma said \u201cany development on the trade war front will just have an interim effect on gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation is far more complicated to be solved in a hurry.\u201d\n\nGold prices were also being weighed by a strong dollar, which makes the metal expensive for buyers holding other currencies.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was slightly up on Monday morning after rising nearly 0.6% last week.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union agreed on Friday to London\u2019s request for a Brexit deadline extension but set no new departure date, giving Britain\u2019s divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s call for a snap election.\n\nElsewhere, silver rose 0.2% to $18.05 per ounce. Platinum was flat at $925.92 per ounce, while palladium rose 0.8% to $1,777.65 per ounce.", "description": "Gold was little changed on Monday, after a near 1% jump in the previous session, as investors awaited a U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision later in the week, while progress in U.S.-China trade talks curbed appetite for safe haven assets.", "authors": ["Diptendu Lahiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445710178&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R079", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
