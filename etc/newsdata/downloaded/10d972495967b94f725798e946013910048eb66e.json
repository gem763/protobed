They exist in their own corner of the internet, they're very cheap to unleash, but no one pays attention to them,' Greg Conley, of the American Vaping Association told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdditional vaping deaths have now been confirmed in Texas, Utah and Massachusetts, bringing the national toll to 28 fatalities across 23 states (red) in the US\n\nBots are everywhere on the Internet. A recent study found that posts could be bought from shadow social media companies for as little as $8 each.\n\nAnother company would sell bundles of 10 social media posts for $100, each from unique accounts.\n\nWith the US e-cigarette market estimated to grow to more than $47 billion by 2025, there's plenty of incentive for manufacturers to press every advantage they can to get an edge.", "description": "US regulators are worried about the popularity of e-cigarettes and have begun demanding major vape manufacturers share their marketing budgets to make sure they're not using bots.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/23/19714292-0-image-a-13_1571093073692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
