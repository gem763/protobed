REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said he would obey the law but would still take Britain out of the European Union at the end of October with or without a deal.\n\nA law passed by Britain\u2019s parliament this month requires Johnson to ask the EU for a three-month delay to Brexit if a deal is not approved by Oct. 19, though British media reports have said that his team are looking at ways to circumvent it.\n\nAsked during an interview with the BBC how he would get round the law, Johnson said: \u201cI will uphold the constitution, I will obey the law, but we will come out on October 31.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that people understand that the UK will not extend ... what we\u2019re going to do is come out on October 31st, deal or no deal.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister gave no indication how he would avoid asking for an extension if there was no deal.\n\nJohnson had earlier pulled out of a press conference with Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, after a noisy crowd of anti-Brexit protestors gathered nearby.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether Britain was a stable country or in chaos, Johnson said it was \u201cextremely stable\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just nonsensical to think that democracy in the UK is any way endangered or the UK economy is in any way endangered,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a period of constitutional adjustment caused by the decision of the people to leave the EU. That was always going to be logistically and practically difficult ... but we\u2019re going to do it and we\u2019re going it by October 31st.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said he would obey the law but would still take Britain out of the European Union at the end of October with or without a deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430577024&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1BL", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
