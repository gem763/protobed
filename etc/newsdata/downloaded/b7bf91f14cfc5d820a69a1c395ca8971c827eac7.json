Now, fans are learning that the Duchess was more than just a guest at her friend Misha Nonoo's wedding to Michael Hess.\n\nAccording to royal reporter Rebecca English, Meghan was the only person to give a reading at the wedding. The passage in question\u2014which the Duchess was asked to choose herself\u2014was \"The Vow\" by Roger McGough. Read the short poem below.\n\nI vow to honor the commitment made this day\n\nWhich, unlike the flowers and the cake,\n\nWill not wither or decay. A promise, not to obey\n\nBut to respond joyfully, to forgive and to console,\n\nFor once incomplete, we now are whole.\n\n\n\nI vow to bear in mind that if, at times\n\nThings seem to go from bad to worse,\n\nThey also go from bad to better.\n\nThe lost purse is handed in, the letter\n\nContains wonderful news. Trains run on time,\n\nHurricanes run out of breath, floods subside,\n\nAnd toast lands jam-side up.\n\n\n\nAnd with this ring, my final vow:\n\nTo recall, whatever the future may bring,\n\nThe love I feel for you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a week and a half ago, Nonoo told the New York Times about how she has stayed close with Meghan, even through her transition to life as a royal. \"All I can say is that from my perspective, she has not changed as a friend,\" Nonoo said.\n\n\"From when I first met her, to a text that I would send yesterday or today, nothing has ever changed. Nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, sources reveal that the Duchess was the only guest at the wedding to give a reading.\n\nMisha and her fianc\u00e9 asked her to chose something appropriate and she plumped for \u2018The Vow\u201d by Roger McGough.\n\n\u2014 Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) September 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The Duchess honored her longtime friend in the sweetest way.", "authors": ["Chloe Foussianes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LhIJXcoO4CDUIPaRcc2ZVA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/2d192758493a8f1c86c5189bf0d20307", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
