REUTERS/Jessica Lutz/File Photo\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday it may cut its growth estimates for global oil demand for 2019 and 2020, should the global economy weaken further.\n\n\u201cIt will depend on the global economy. If the global economy weakens, for which there are already some signs, we may lower oil demand expectations,\u201d IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters.\n\nIn China, the world\u2019s second largest economy and top importer of crude, industrial firms reported a contraction in profits in August, reversing the previous month\u2019s brief expansion, as weak domestic demand and a trade war with the United States weighed on corporate balance sheets.\n\n\u201cOil prices continued to slide lower after a drop in China\u2019s industrial profits in August reinforced worries that the world\u2019s second-largest economy continues to decelerate,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 55 cents, or 0.9%, from the previous session\u2019s close to $62.19 a barrel by 0653 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 fell 30 cents, or 0.5%, to $56.11 a barrel.\n\nThe rapid return of oil production from top world exporter Saudi Arabia less than two weeks after the Sept. 14 attacks also squashed risk premiums and dragged crude prices lower, analysts said.\n\n\u201cFor most of the week ... the market has been trading lower as oil bulls have been discouraged by the quicker-than-expected return of Saudi oil output,\u201d said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nWTI futures were down 3.4% so far for the week, marking the largest weekly loss in 10 weeks, while Brent was down 3.3% for the week, its largest weekly loss in seven.\n\nA surprise 2.4 million-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories last week also weighed on prices.\n\nU.S. inventories may rise further over the near term, further pressuring prices, as American refiners curb runs for maintenance, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe expected lower demand for oil inputs into (U.S.) refineries typically sees U.S. crude inventories swell, all of which could pose a significant downside risk for prompt oil prices,\u201d Innes said.\n\nEmerging details connected to the impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump also helped dent demand sentiment, analysts said.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s impeachment inquiry also raises uncertainty surrounding his foreign policy,\u201d said Margaret Yang Yan, a market analyst at CMC Markets, particularly on Iran and China.\n\n\u201cThe market is assessing how this political turbulence may affect his ability and position to impose further sanctions on Iran, which will have significant impact on global oil supply.\u201d", "description": "Oil prices fell on Friday as economic headwinds revived concerns of slowing global demand growth and a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi crude oil output eased worries over potential major supply disruptions.", "authors": ["Roslan Khasawneh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434362246&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q05H", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
