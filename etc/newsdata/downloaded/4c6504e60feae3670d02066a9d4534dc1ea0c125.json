Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, July 18, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nThe congresswoman told the Detroit police department that non-blacks should be barred from working as analysts in the bureau\u2019s facial-recognition unit.\n\nRepresentative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) recently told the Detroit police department that non-blacks should be barred from working as analysts in the bureau\u2019s facial-recognition unit. Why? Because \u201cnon-African Americans,\u201d she insisted, \u201cthink African Americans all look the same.\u201d\n\nIs that right? Here, Tlaib takes a nasty sentiment held by an archetypal racist in the antebellum South, superimposes it onto the country today as if nothing has changed in the intervening 200 years, and casts aspersions on groups on the basis of that error.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNon-blacks, as a group, think that \u201cAfrican Americans all look the same\u201d? I\u2019m not sure that this was true in 1819, let alone today. Facial recognition \u201canalysts need to be African American,\u201d the freshman congresswoman demanded, to the visible dismay of the black police chief, \u201cnot people that are not.\u201d\n\nHow, in the world of Tlaib\u2019s making, will we determine who gets counted as an \u201cAfrican American\u201d for purposes of employment at the Detroit Police Department? DNA tests? Self-identification? The one-drop rule?\n\nSure, the use of facial recognition software in criminal investigations is fraught. It raises a number of potential procedural issues given the software\u2019s yet-uncertain accuracy. The human intermediaries employed by law enforcement to parse the software\u2019s results are, no doubt, subject to their own biases. But even with that said, it\u2019s unclear why people of a certain melanin count should be unilaterally barred from the profession. What would Tlaib have the police department do? Ignore federal non-discrimination law because she, a freshman congresswoman from Michigan, happens to have a low opinion of non-black facial-recognition analysts?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit police chief James Craig (who, as it happens, is black) rebuked Tlaib\u2019s proposal, saying that he puts his \u201ctrust\u201d in \u201cpeople who are trained regardless of race and regardless of gender.\u201d He later said: \u201cThe fact that she made that statement, what does that say to the members of this department who are analysts, who are trained, who are white? That they in some way can\u2019t do their job professionally? That\u2019s insulting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTlaib posted a response Wednesday, doubling down on her initial claim \u2014 to no one\u2019s surprise,. She invoked social science which purports to demonstrate that facial recognition rates are lower across races than among one\u2019s own racial group. Since Detroit is a heavily black area, the logic goes, only black police officers should analyze the facial recognition data.\n\nAssuming, for argument\u2019s sake, the studies she cites are accurate, Tlaib seems to suggest that race is a \u201cbona-fide occupational qualification\u201d for certain law-enforcement roles in Detroit \u2014 an available exemption to the non-discrimination principle set forth in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can membership in a racial group really be an occupational qualification for law enforcement in the same way being a woman is an occupational qualification for Hooters waitresses, or being Catholic is an occupational qualification for parochial school principals? Tlaib appears to suggest that group disparities on facial-recognition tests should bar members of those groups from participating in Detroit\u2019s facial-recognition unit. Obviously, inter-group disparities should not be used to disqualify broad classes of people from jobs they might well be individually qualified for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are certain things that might legitimately disqualify a person from holding this job. Demonstrated racial animus, for instance, would seem a fine reason to deem someone unfit. Like Spike Lee, for instance: \u201cI give interracial couples a look,\u201d the putative civil-rights hero told Esquire in 1992, \u201cDaggers. They get uncomfortable when they see me on the street.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it would seem reasonable to avoid hiring someone who shares Mr. Lee\u2019s views for a job on the local police department\u2019s face-recognition software unit, because it\u2019s not clear that his biases won\u2019t color the way he \u201clooks\u201d at the relevant surveillance footage and head-shot database. But it\u2019s because of how he looks \u2014 the verb \u2014 not what he looks like.\n\nPerhaps Rashida Tlaib would prefer we lived in a world in which the hiring policies of the nation\u2019s police bureaus were subject to whatever it is that she happens to \u201cthink\u201d about the qualifications of various racial groups on random Mondays in September. Thankfully, we do not. But we now know how Rashida Tlaib presumes non-black people view their African-American neighbors.", "description": "The congresswoman told the Detroit police department that non-blacks should be barred from working as analysts in the bureau\u2019s facial-recognition unit.", "authors": ["John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
