Eleven soldiers were also injured,\" the statement added.\n\nThe army said the security forces had successfully fought off the assailants before the arrival of reinforcements.\n\nUntil 2015, the poor West African country was largely spared violence that hit Mali and then Niger, its neighbours to the north.\n\nBut attackers - some linked to al-Qaeda, others to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group - started infiltrating the north, then the east, and then endangered the southern and western borders of the landlocked country.\n\nCombining hit-and-run tactics with road mines and suicide bombings, the insurgents have killed nearly 600 people, according to a toll compiled by AFP news agency.\n\nCivil society groups put the number at more than 1,000, with attacks now taking place on an almost daily basis.\n\nBurkina's defence and security forces are badly-equipped, poorly trained and have shown themselves to be unable to put a halt to the increasing violence.\n\nFrance has a force of 200 in Burkina Faso but also intervenes frequently as part of its regional Barkhane operation.", "description": "Five security officers killed and 11 others injured in twin attacks on army bases in northern Burkina Faso.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/20/6211be247a0340d18c0b53163b20addc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
