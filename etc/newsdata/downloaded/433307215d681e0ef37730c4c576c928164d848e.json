Different polls projected Likud to win either 30, 31 or 32 seats.\n\nA party needs 61 seats in the 120-member Knesset to form a government. No party has ever won that many seats outright, so one of the major parties needs to form a coalition with smaller parties to reach the 61-seat majority and form a government.\n\nISRAELI EXIT POLLS SHOW NETANYAHU SHORT OF MAJORITY IN YEAR'S SECOND ELECTION\n\nNow the question remains: Do Israelis wish to continue on Netanyahu\u2019s path and keep him in power? He is already the nation\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, with 12 years in office.\n\nOr, are Israelis prepared to hand the reins over to Gantz \u2013 who, despite holding a rich military background, has little experience in political matters.\n\nOne thing is clear from the exit polls: Netanyahu and Likud \u2013 which played up Netanyahu\u2019s strong relationship with President Trump and the prime minister\u2019s proposed annexation of parts of the West Bank in their campaign \u2013 did not get the overwhelming mandate from voters they were looking for.\n\nIf Israeli exit polls are accurate \u2013 a big if \u2013 it appears Netanyahu\u2019s mandate will have weakened to the point where he will prove unable to avoid criminal indictments possibly heading his way this fall.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if the Likud Party will abandon its leader to face the Supreme Court alone in his criminal case, and if Netanyahu would have a role to play in a broad national unity coalition if one is formed between Likud and Blue and White.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that both Netanyahu and Gantz each told supporters early Wednesday morning they would form a winning coalition. Which one will succeed is unknown at this time.\n\n\u201cAll of the Likud's partners want to move forward together to build a strong government and not permit a dangerous anti-Zionist government,\u201d Netanyahu told a gathering of his supporters.\n\nGantz told his supporters that he has already spoken to leaders of some other political parties and would reach out to others. \"I call here to all my political rivals, to leave the disagreements aside and work together to create a fair and equal society for all of Israel's citizens,\" he said.\n\nTrading on his relationships with President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other world leaders, Netanyahu sought to link his leadership to the security of the country \u2013 something Israelis value more than any political position or party.\n\nThe Israeli election Tuesday was the second in five months. In elections in April, Likud and Blue and White (named for the colors of the Israeli flag) each won 35 seats. Netanyahu and Likud fell one vote short of forming a 61-seat coalition majority, prompting him to call a new election rather than giving Blue and White the chance to try to form a coalition.\n\nThe collapse of the Knesset in April soon after members were elected was unprecedented.\n\nNow, after months of uncertainty and a campaign that cost the Israeli government around $700 million, Israelis must hold their breath to see what type of government emerges.\n\nIsrael\u2019s electoral system differs in many ways from the United States. Israeli voters cast a ballot for a political party \u2013 not for individual candidates.\n\nThere were 30 parties on the ballot. Once the votes are counted, seats are assigned proportionally based on the percentage of votes to parties that go above a certain threshold.\n\nAt that point, the deal-making begins in an effort for one of the main parties to create a coalition controlling at least 61 Knesset seats. This is why Israelis are still left wondering just who their prime minister will be, what the makeup of the ruling coalition will be, and what the direction of the government will be.\n\nIt appears that Israel is stuck in the position of having Avigdor Liberman\u2019s far-right Yisrael Beiteinu Party in the role of kingmaker, similar to April\u2019s results.\n\nUnlike typical Israeli and American elections, political positioning was merely a sideshow in this campaign. There is no right-vs-left in Israel anymore. Netanyahu and Gantz do not differ much politically.\n\nRather, this election was a referendum on Netanyahu, who has loomed over Israeli politics for three decades and is perhaps the most skilled political tactician Israel has ever known since the creation of the modern state in 1948.\n\nTrading on his relationships with President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other world leaders, Netanyahu sought to link his leadership to the security of the country \u2013 something Israelis value more than any political position or party.\n\nIndeed, the power of Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cMr. Security\u201d image was demonstrated by Likud\u2019s strong showing in April\u2019s election, despite charges of corruption and possible criminal indictments that Netanyahu may face.\n\nUltimately, Netanyahu\u2019s electoral strength reveals that Israelis are willing to overlook their disdain for the pending corruption charges against him for the feeling of protection and security that Netanyahu has brought to the nation during his tenure.\n\nBeyond his promise of security, Netanyahu has also presided over what many call the greatest period of economic and political growth that Israel has ever known.\n\nAs we await official results, Israel and the rest of the world are in a holding pattern to see the direction diplomacy in the Middle East will take for the foreseeable future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAt this point, all likely outcomes point to four options for Israel\u2019s next government: a unity coalition government made up of Likud and Blue and White \u2013 the preferred scenario of a majority of the electorate; a narrow right-wing government; a stalemate that can only be broken by Liberman\u2019s Yisrael Beiteinu Party; or a government including a group of Arab political parties called the Joint List \u2013 a nightmare scenario for most of Israel\u2019s Jewish majority.\n\nDespite the fearmongering on both sides, Israeli voters can rest assured that whether Gantz or Netanyahu emerges victorious, government policies will not swing drastically \u2013 provided Gantz can reach 61 seats without relying on Arab support. Unfortunately, that is an almost impossible scenario.\n\nThere may be less accommodations to the Orthodox Jewish population if Gantz becomes prime minister, and there may be increased talk of annexing Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank if Netanyahu wins.\n\nHowever, the demise of the Israeli left as a consequence of Palestinian extremism has guaranteed that no true leftist government will be elected in Israel in the foreseeable future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter a tumultuous five months since the last election, only one thing is certain: Israel needs a strong government that is able to provide for the country\u2019s defense, effectively advocate for keeping pressure on Iran, and end the paralysis that has gripped the country since April.\n\nUntil the 45-day waiting period to form a new government is up and a true winner is announced, one of America\u2019s staunchest allies is without a functioning government and is forced to await the results of deal-making.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DOUG SCHOEN", "description": "The battle to lead Israel continues after a close election, as the top two candidates compete for support from smaller parties to form a coalition government.", "authors": ["Douglas Schoen", "Douglas E.
