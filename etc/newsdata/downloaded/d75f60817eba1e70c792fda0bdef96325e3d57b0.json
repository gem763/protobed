Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Never Let Me Go imagines a population of human clones whose organs are harvested for transplant, and Rachel Heng\u2019s Suicide Club reflects on what humans might lose if 300-year life spans become possible (and enforceable by the state).\n\nSuch questions are by no means limited to fiction, though. In The Body Politic: The Battle Over Science in America, the bioethicist Jonathan D. Moreno discusses the impact that developments in neuroscience and globalization have had on his field, and how once-academic issues such as stem-cell research have become deeply intertwined with politics. Indeed, as medicine advances into legal gray areas, there\u2019s a good chance that bioethics questions will eventually come before the Supreme Court\u2014and if they do, Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s 2006 book, The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia, will be well worth a read.", "description": "Not the same old stories: Your weekly guide to the best in books", "authors": ["Rosa Inocencio Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/shutterstock_241976791/facebook.jpg?1569534025", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
