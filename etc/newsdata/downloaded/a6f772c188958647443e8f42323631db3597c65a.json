It is believed that after the camera stops filming the bride drives off and leaves the biker by himself\n\nIt is thought that the bride drove away a short time later and left the biker alone on his two-wheeler, according to local media reports.\n\nSocial media users were quick to criticise the biker's actions as they commented on the clip after it was posted online.\n\nOne user, Rosibel Lopez Gomez, wrote: 'He lost his opportunity when he was with her, now let her marry in peace, sh*t.'\n\nAnother, Flor de Primavera, added: 'What a humiliating situation, ridiculous, nobody is forcing anybody to marry, whoever is getting married does it because they want to, it is nothing about confusion, everybody is responsible for their choices in life, the woman decided to get married, and this guy is humiliating a woman who does not love him anymore.'\n\nNeither the bride nor the biker have been identified.", "description": "The footage was captured by an onlooker\u00a0in the city of Medellin in\u00a0Antioquia, Colombia.
