Initially she wore items for free, but today she earns several hundred thousand dollars per year running a full-time business.\n\n\"It\u2019s a huge pull not just for fashion brands, and it's more corporate than what people might think,\" Russian says.\n\nThe head of digital engagement at global giant Unilever, Casey DePalma McCartney, told an industry conference last month it was critical for influencer marketing to have independent measurement to be able to grow. \u201cVerification needs to be part of the space,\u201d she said, and \u201csocial platforms have to get on board.\u201d\n\nThe founder of Sydney agency L &A Social Media, Gina Lednyak, agreed, saying for influencers to evolve \"they will need to show clear analytics, similar to how any media outlet provides\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Additionally, to ensure the uniformity of analytics, these should come from a third-party tool, or the social platform itself. Brands are increasingly making data-driven decisions to ensure marketing is effective and this will play a large role in creating a strong partnership between brands and influencers.\u201d\n\nHypeAuditor is a tool that media agencies use it to get a clearer picture of the 'real' commercial value of any influencer. HypeAuditor\n\nAccording to the right.fit, an influencer marketplace similar to Airtasker, 71 per cent of consumers are more likely to make a purchase based on a social media reference.\n\nFounder Taryn Williams said, on average, businesses generate $6.50 for every $1 invested in influencer marketing.\n\n\"Influencers now must have the ability to move the meter to increase brand awareness, drive conversion, improve consideration and create unique content,\" she said.\n\nWilliams adds that a brand will seek someone to speak with authority, such as a mummy influencer with young children, or a vegan foodie. Someone who has taken the time to curate that audience, and build trust with their followers - which is a time-consuming process.\n\nWhile there are other social media stars with more followers than Russian, it's about authenticity.\n\nSocial media has played a major role in the success and growth of self-tanning products company Bondi Sands, which has 700,000 followers on Instagram and is aiming to hit $100 million in sales this year. Up until 2017, Bondi Sands only used social media marketing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The brand has evolved as the world of influencers did,\" says chief executive and co-founder Blair James.\n\n\"It was a way for us to reach large audiences at a small cost. What we like about influencers is it's like word of mouth marketing on steroids.\"\n\nBondi Sands is now considering traditional media to supplement social media as the group moves into new offerings like cosmetics and sun care.\n\nLarger companies like The A2 Milk Company and rival baby formula maker Bellamy's both have invested heavily in using social media influencers as part of their push to reach Chinese mothers.\n\nAustralian social media influencers have grown into big business globally. Russian is one of the seven Aussies nominated in a new category for the American E! People\u2019s Choice Awards in Los Angeles, which recognises people in entertainment. The winner gets to walk the red carpet with pop icons like Taylor Swift, Ellen DeGeneres and Lady Gaga.
