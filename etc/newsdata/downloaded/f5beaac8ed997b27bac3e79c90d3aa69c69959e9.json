The call has set off a furor in Washington, and led congressional Democrats to push forward with an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSupport, which was provided by the EU, has been unprecedented. The EU sanctions would have been impossible without Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, without @EmmanuelMacron, the successor of Francois Hollande as the President of France. Both countries represented the whole EU \u2014 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e (@poroshenko) September 26, 2019\n\nZelenskiy quickly agreed, telling Trump: \"Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100 percent but actually 1,000 percent.\" Zelenskiy, however, quickly shifted the focus to whether enough was being done to enforce sanctions, rather than on military assistance or financial aid.\n\n\"Germany does almost nothing for you,\" Trump had said. \"All they do is talk and I think it\u2019s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel, she talks Ukraine, but she doesn\u2019t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it\u2019s something you want to look at but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAccording to EU fact sheets, the bloc has directed more than \u20ac15 billion in assistance to Kyiv since the conflict with Russia began in 2014.\n\nPoroshenko remains active in Ukrainian politics, as a member of parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, and a leader of a rival party to Zelenskiy. Poroshenko had a good relationship with Merkel while president but the criticism of his successor could be risky, potentially opening himself up to allegations that he is aiming to gain politically from Ukraine getting caught in the middle of a partisan political fight in the U.S.", "description": "Sanctions against Russia would not have been possible without help from Germany and France, former Ukraine president says.", "authors": ["David M.
