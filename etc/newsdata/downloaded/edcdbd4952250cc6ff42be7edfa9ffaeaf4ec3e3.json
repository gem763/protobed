I hadn\u2019t come before, precisely because (Franco) was buried here. And today is my first time here,\u201d said Roig, visibly moved.\n\nSpain\u2019s ruling Socialists had long pledged to remove Franco\u2019s remains and any elements celebrating the fascist dictator from the edifice, which serves as a mass grave for over 34,000 soldiers both nationalist and leftist republican.\n\nAfter the three-year civil war ended in 1939, Franco ordered thousands of republicans\u2019 bodies be moved to the Valley of the Fallen, often against or without their families\u2019 consent. The fact that a dictator was buried alongside his victims was part of the acting government\u2019s rationale for removing his remains on Thursday.\n\nBut the issue could prove a double-edged sword for the Socialists ahead of a Nov. 10 parliamentary election, Spain\u2019s fourth in as many years, as it appeared to strengthen the far-right Vox party, which had opposed the move, in opinion polls.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, so much focus on Franco seemed excessively like marketing to some left-wing voters, with the helicopters - it was all very Hollywood,\u201d said Narciso Michavila, head of polling agency GAD3.\n\nFor foreign visitors such as Ulrik Soldberg from Denmark, the Valley is a must-see with or without Franco. \u201cWe came because we heard so much about it,\u201d Soldberg told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nAmerican tourist Murray Iansky, however, is conscious of the political significance of Franco\u2019s exhumation: \u201cThe victors make the history. ... Now this is the victory of (Spain\u2019s) new government and democracy and everything.\u201d", "description": "Visitors ranging from curious to nostalgic took in the new look of Spain's Civil War shrine in the Valley of the Fallen, as it reopened on Tuesday five days after the government exhumed the remains of fascist dictator Francisco Franco from the mausoleum.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
