(Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE \u2014 A Monticello tour guide was explaining how enslaved people built, planted and tended a terrace of vegetables at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s estate earlier this summer when a woman interrupted to share her annoyance.\n\n\u201cWhy are you talking about that?\u201d she demanded, according to Gary Sandling, vice president of Monticello\u2019s visitor programs and services. \u201cYou should be talking about the plants.\"\n\nAt Monticello, George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon and other plantations across the South, an effort is underway to deal more honestly with the brutal institution that the Founding Fathers relied on to build their homes and their wealth: slavery.\n\nFour hundred years after the first enslaved Africans arrived in the English colony of Virginia, some sites are also connecting that ugly past to modern-day racism and inequality.\n\nThe changes have begun to draw people long alienated by the sites\u2019 whitewashing of the past and to satisfy what staff call a hunger for real history, as plantations add slavery-focused tours, rebuild cabins and reconstruct the lives of the enslaved with help from their descendants. But some visitors, who remain overwhelmingly white, are pushing back, and the very mention of slavery and its impacts on the United States can bring accusations of playing politics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a very polarized, partisan political moment in our country, and not surprisingly, when we are in those moments, history becomes equally polarized,\u201d Sandling said.\n\nThe backlash is reflected in some online reviews of plantations, including McLeod in Charleston, S.C., where one visitor complained earlier this summer that she \u201cdidn\u2019t come to hear a lecture on how the white people treated slaves.\u201d\n\n[Some white people don\u2019t want to hear about slavery at plantations built by slaves]\n\nThe review sparked shock as it made rounds on the Internet. But stories of guests\u2019 discomfort are familiar to many on the front lines at historical sites steeped in slavery: the tour guides, reenactors and other staff with an up-close view of how Americans think and talk about a shameful past.\n\n\n\nNiya Bates is Monticello's director of African American history, and Brandon Dillard is its manager of special programs. (Will Dillon for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello)\n\nA shifting message\n\nThere was a time when visitors \u201cwould not have heard the word \u2018slave\u2019 in this house,\u201d David Ronka said early on in a 105-minute dive into the lives of the best-known enslaved family at Monticello, the Hemingses.\n\nVisitors might have heard references to \u201cMr. Jefferson\u2019s people,\u201d said the veteran guide. Or maybe \u201cthe souls of his family,\u201d a phrase from the author of the Declaration of Independence who owned more than 600 enslaved people over his lifetime.\n\n[Saving Thomas Jefferson\u2019s soul]\n\nNow, Monticello\u2019s guides, called \u201cinterpreters,\u201d tell their nearly half a million visitors a year about \u201censlaved people.\u201d \u201cSlave\u201d is a noun, Ronka said as other tour groups\u2019 footsteps shuffled overhead. \u201cEnslaved\u201d is a condition, he added: a way to talk about people defined by more than their bondage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting, you know, for this story, for this amount of truth about the past,\u201d said Niya Bates, Monticello\u2019s director of African American history.\n\nThe truth came gradually, starting in the 1990s with an effort to gather oral histories and a tour on slavery. Last year, Monticello opened a room once home to Sally Hemings amid growing evidence that Jefferson fathered her children. Interpreters talk about what Ronka calls the \u201ccentral irony\u201d of the nation\u2019s third president, who said he hated slavery, at some points advocating against it, but freed just seven of the hundreds of men and women he owned.\n\n\n\n\"The Life of Sally Hemings\" exhibit at Monticello debuted in 2018.

(Eze Amos/For The Washington Post)\n\nVisitor reviews of Monticello on travel site TripAdvisor are overwhelmingly positive. But the negative comments are increasingly likely to blast the amount of time devoted to slavery, decrying \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and the bashing of a giant of American history. Two years ago, only a couple of the poor reviews mentioned slavery. This year, almost all of them do.\n\n\u201cFor someone like myself, going to Monticello is like an Elvis fan going to Graceland,\u201d one review from July reads. \u201cThen to have the tour guide essentially make constant reference to what a bad person he really was just ruined it for me.\u201d\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society is a staunch opponent of Monticello\u2019s decision to tell visitors Jefferson fathered children with Sally Hemings, after years of fierce disagreement over the strength of the evidence. John Works, a Jefferson descendant and president of the society, believes Monticello has overemphasized slavery at the expense of Jefferson\u2019s accomplishments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to the appeal, I think, of the slavery message,\u201d he said.\n\nModern legacies\n\nStaff at James Madison\u2019s Virginia estate, Montpelier, get complaints every month that a 10-minute video they show is pushing propaganda. The film traces slavery\u2019s effects through history, from Jim Crow and economic inequality to gerrymandering and redlining.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty in your face,\u201d acknowledged Price Thomas, Montpelier\u2019s marketing and communications director.\n\nIt grew from discussions with descendants of Madison\u2019s slaves as the staff created a permanent exhibit called \u201cThe Mere Distinction of Colour,\u201d said Thomas, who joined Montpelier to manage the exhibition\u2019s launch. Their advice: \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about slavery as a relic of the past.\u201d\n\nMaking those explicit connections to racism and inequality today can raise hackles, said Brandon Dillard, manager of special programs at Monticello.\n\n\u201cPeople do get uncomfortable because those things have been politicized despite the statistical support,\u201d he said.\n\nSome plantations avoid going there. Staff members at Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington and a destination for more than 1 million visitors each year, \u201chaven\u2019t really looked into making connections to modern issues going on,\u201d said Jeremy Ray, director of interpretation. And the issue of backlash rarely comes up at monthly training sessions, he said.\n\nThe site charges extra for its Enslaved People of Mount Vernon tour, discussing slavery in its main tour only in passing with the names and duties of seamstresses, valets and cooks.\n\nSome people may see an agenda in just the mention of slavery. One August visitor to Mount Vernon was happy to chat with a Washington Post reporter about his day at the estate \u2014 until he learned he would be asked about the site\u2019s approach to the people Jefferson owned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to politicize my experience here,\u201d the man said from a sunny bench in Washington\u2019s flower gardens, declining to give his name.\n\nOther visitors come with politics on their mind. They think about the culture war over Confederate monuments, the neo-Nazis who marched with torches around Jefferson\u2019s statue at the University of Virginia \u2014 15 minutes down the road from Monticello \u2014 during the 2017 Unite the Right rally.\n\n[Neo-Nazis rallied around Jefferson\u2019s statue. But it was a Jewish family that saved Monticello.]\n\nIn South Carolina, Shawn Halifax, who trains interpreters and leads programming at McLeod, remembers the jolt of learning that white supremacist Dylann Roof visited the plantation not long before killing nine black people in a Charleston church in 2015.\n\nHe also remembers the precise words of the white woman who pulled him aside after a tour about a year ago. She told him that he hated the South, painting the cotton plantation \u201cwith a brush that was much too large and far too black.\u201d\n\nHalifax thanked her for her comments, he recalled. He said he disagreed but would think them over. And he has.\n\nMcLeod focuses on bondage, talking bluntly about \u201cslave labor camps\u201d and shunning the big white house for the fields. That means some people\u2019s beliefs are being challenged, Halifax said. Staff members try to gauge frowns and crossed arms and even embrace them as signs of those who could learn the most, if guides can break through.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we coddle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does mean that we allow people room and space to have an experience and walk away thinking differently.\u201d\n\n\u2018One and the same\u2019\n\nMcLeod is unusual but not alone in teaching primarily about slavery. Whitney Plantation opened in Louisiana in 2014 with a similar mission.\n\nSome visitors warn online that Whitney is a \u201cslavery tour\u201d rather than a real \u201cplantation tour,\u201d said Joy Banner, the site\u2019s marketing director.\n\n\u201cHonestly, 'plantation\u2019 and \u2018slavery\u2019 is one and the same,\u201d she said.\n\n[Missouri v. Celia, a Slave: She killed the white master raping her, then claimed self-defense]\n\nThat mind-set has drawn newly diverse crowds. Almost 16 percent of Whitney\u2019s visitors were African American in a survey conducted a few years ago, said Amy Potter, a professor of geography at Georgia Southern University who helped lead the research. Most plantations had white visitor percentages in the high 80s to 90s.\n\nEven at the more traditional plantations studied, Potter said, slavery was visitors\u2019 top interest post-tour, beating out features like the gardens and the lands\u2019 original owners. And Whitney\u2019s focus on enslaved lives is attracting more and more people. About 30,000 visited the first year, Banner said; 110,000 are projected to come in 2019.\n\nGary Watson grew up in nearby Vacherie, La., where his family members, descended from Haitians forced into slavery, were surrounded by plantations billed as romantic getaways. His grandfather refused to visit any of them.\n\n\u201cHis ancestors worked so hard to get off plantations,\u201d Watson said. But he thinks his grandfather would have felt differently about Whitney.\n\nDescendants of the enslaved now work as historians and interpreters at many historical sites.\n\nThe jobs can be draining.\n\nStephen Seals, a black reenactor at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia, tries not to be disheartened when, once a week or so, visitors walk away after realizing they\u2019re talking with a man playing a slave. Sometimes they sigh or say, \u201cNot this again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth it, Seals said, to bring humanity to people long denied it. He calls the reenacting the greatest work of his life.\n\n\n\nStephen Seals portrays an enslaved spy named James Armistead Lafayette at Colonial Williamsburg. (Darnell Vennie/Colonial Williamsburg Foundation)\n\nMany white visitors think talk about slavery is meant to guilt them, Seals said. Others think of his character \u2014 James Armistead Lafayette, who won his freedom by spying on the British army \u2014 as telling \u201can African American story\u201d far from their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an American story,\u201d Seals said. \u201cIt is a part of who we are.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nShe was captured and enslaved 400 years ago.
