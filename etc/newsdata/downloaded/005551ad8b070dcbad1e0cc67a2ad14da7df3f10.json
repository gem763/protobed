It\u2019s youth football season, and the Conshohocken Golden Bears were on a roll last Saturday. In their Keystone State youth football league game they were up 30-0 over their opponents and once again had the ball and were driving toward the endzone. An excited five-year-old player took the handoff and broke for the endzone. And that\u2019s when everything went wrong. The team was penalized and is now facing a stiff fine from the league. The reason? They scored too many points. (CBS Philadelphia)\n\nA youth football team dominated its competition over the weekend. So what could be wrong with that? Apparently, their win was too big and now they may end up having to pay a fine. \u201cDon\u2019t play well. Just play OK.\u201d That\u2019s the message that some parents feel is being expressed to their young football players\u2026 \u201cThere\u2019s a 31-point rule that every organization, every team has to abide by. We violated that rule,\u201d said Mike Mikalonis, president of the Conshohocken Bears.\n\nIn the local CBS news clip below, you can see the coash racing along the sideline trying to convince the kid to not go into the endzone. But the young boy is far too excited to slow down.\n\nThis is just sad. Nobody likes to lose, and certainly not in a blowout, but what sort of lesson are we sending kids who choose to participate in competitive sports with a rule like this? Don\u2019t do too well or you might hurt someone\u2019s feelings? There are no blowout rules in college and professional sports. You play to win. Sometimes a coach will pull the first string if they\u2019re way up just to avoid injuries and give some of the rookies some experience in real action, but it\u2019s not a requirement.\n\nThat seemed to be the message a former member of the Philadelphia Eagles was sending on Twitter.\n\n@YouthKeystone is trippin!\n\n1. Kids need to learn how to deal with failure. Don\u2019t want to get smashed? Play better.\n\n2. Life doesn\u2019t let up. When it rains it pours.\n\n3. The other kids can\u2019t give their all because there is a rule. \u201cWork hard but not too hard\u201d that\u2019s stupid. \u2014 Torrey Smith (@TorreySmithWR) October 12, 2019\n\nThis mentality of \u201ceverybody gets a trophy\u201d doesn\u2019t do children any favors. They\u2019re getting an education in school but they\u2019re also being prepared for the real world when they graduate. And the fact is that everyone doesn\u2019t always get a trophy. If you lose, you pick yourself up, dust yourself off and try harder next time. (My disastrous efforts in junior varsity football hammered that lesson home on a regular basis.)\n\nCome on, guys. Let the kids play. And if somebody takes a bad loss, use that as an opportunity to educate them and prepare them for the realities of life.", "description": "A big cash fine for... playing too well", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/football.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
