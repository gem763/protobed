We've ranked the 50 best of the millennium", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE 2019's holiday moviegoers get the chance to travel from a friendly neighborhood (hello, Mister Rogers!) to a galaxy far, far away. USA TODAY\n\nThis isn't recency bias talking: The 21st century has given us some pretty great horror films.\n\nSure, the last millennium was rather awesome, too, with the Universal monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein and friends); villains like Jason Voorhees and Leatherface; Alfred Hitchcock's seminal \"Psycho\" shower scene; and every dread-filled minute of \"The Exorcist.\" All helped in the rise of an entire genre of neato scary movies.\n\nBut horror flicks since 2001 have been revolutionary in their own way, using technology and modern issues to examine the darker sides of humanity. The Internet gives us opportunity to be exposed to noteworthy terrors from other countries more than ever before, depending on the Wi-Fi. And especially recently, there's been an artful bent to horror that allows newer filmmakers such as Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\") and Ari Aster (\"Hereditary\") to make vital and important films that may also leave you in a fetal position.\n\nReview: Thought-provoking 'It: Chapter 2' grows up with its horror heroes\n\nRanked: The best horror movies this year (including 'Ready or Not')\n\nHere are the 50 best horror films of this century, definitively ranked. (And if you don't see your favorite here, just assume it's No. 51.)\n\nMilo Cawthorne (left) and James Blake conjure heavy-metal magic in the horror comedy \"Deathgasm.\" (Photo: Dark Sky Films)\n\n50. 'Deathgasm' (2015)\n\nThis one definitely goes to 11: Two teenage rocker dudes \u2013 who yearn to add some excitement to their lives \u2013 delve into black magic and accidentally conjure a demonic entity known as The Blind One. Which is a very metal thing to do.\n\n49. 'The Purge' (2013)\n\nIn the franchise that's become way too timely for comfort, the first film is tops, with Ethan Hawke trying to keep his family safe from masked maniacs during an all-night legal crime spree.\n\n48. 'Trick 'r Treat' (2007)\n\nThis Halloween treasure features four intertwining tales of mischief and menace. The common thread in the anthology? An enigmatic kid named Sam, wearing pajamas and a sack on his head, who punishes those who break holiday tradition.\n\nA couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) are haunted in their bedroom by a malevolent spirit in \"Paranormal Activity.\" (Photo: Paramount Pictures)\n\n47. 'Paranormal Activity' (2009)\n\nThe found-footage and haunted house subgenres went together like peanut butter and jelly in this low-budget chiller that chronicles the demonic threat to a young couple through the always-watchful lens of a home video camera.\n\n46. 'May' (2003)\n\nOne of the more criminally underrated films of the genre, this Frankenstein-esque tale stars Angela Bettis as the title woman, a lonely sort whose sole friend is a doll made by her mom. As May starts to look for more personal connection, and struggles to find it, she decides to craft her own human pal, piece by piece.\n\n45. 'The Ring' (2002)\n\nA cursed videotape that kills anyone who views it seven days later falls into the hands of Naomi Watts for a neat spook show. (Guys, ghost girl Samara is STILL freaking us out.) More importantly, it sparked an American interest in the original \"Ringu\" and other outstanding Asian horror of the time.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone and Frank the bunny in \"Donnie Darko.\" (Photo: FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT)\n\n44. 'Donnie Darko' (2001)\n\nIs this crazy psychological thriller a horror movie? Jake Gyllenhaal dealing with an aircraft engine falling into his bedroom and interacting with a giant rabbit named Frank \u2013 who tells him doomsday's afoot in 28 days \u2013 is all the answer you really need.\n\n43. 'The Loved Ones' (2009)\n\nThere are both intriguing character relationships and super-gnarly home medical procedures (lobotomy by electric drill!) to be had when an Australian teenager (Xavier Samuel) turns down the prom proposal of a classmate (Robin McLeavy) and gets an unexpected night to remember.\n\n42. 'Halloween' (2018)\n\nThe 11th film featuring machete-wielding masked man Michael Myers rids itself of unneeded previous canon and acts as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 original, pitting the villain vs. the woman (Jamie Lee Curtis) who's waited four decades for a rematch.\n\n41. 'Drag Me to Hell' (2009)\n\nSam Raimi's flick starred Alison Lohman as a loan officer who, wanting to impress her boss, refuses to extend an old gypsy woman's mortgage. Suffice it to say, not the best decision, considering the three nightmarish days that follow. And that title? That's some real truth in advertising.\n\n40. 'REC' (2007)\n\nGot claustrophobia? Then maybe ease gently into this Spanish found-footage chiller. A night news crew enters a building with firefighters called in to help an old woman trapped in her apartment, she gets a little too bitey and, before you know it, zombies everywhere.\n\nKate Lyn Sheil plays a mysterious woman messing up a couple's second honeymoon in the anthology \"V/H/S.\" (Photo: MAGNET RELEASING)\n\n39. 'V/H/S' (2012)\n\nUsing a found-footage framing device, the anthology unleashes a bevy of shorts revolving around a second honeymoon gone wrong, a freaky sci-fi story told through video chats, and some pervy dudes who make a deadly mistake recruiting a mysterious young woman for their amateur porn.\n\n38. 'Ju-On: The Grudge' (2004)\n\nNo, not the Sarah Michelle Gellar version. (Come on now.) The original Japanese flick featured a social worker (Megumi Okina) seeing all manner of freaky ghost children in her house. And there's a timeless quality, too, because, well, ghastly kids are always ghastly.\n\n37. 'We Are Still Here' (2015)\n\nSet in 1970s New England, the spin on the haunted house template centers on a couple who moves to a sleepy hamlet following the death of their college-age son and into a place that still contains the dark, ashen souls of the Dagmar family that lived there and a supernatural force that awakens every 30 years.\n\nLorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) investigates a freaky music box in director James Wan's \"The Conjuring.\" (Photo: MICHAEL TACKETT/WARNER BROS.)\n\n36. 'The Conjuring' (2013)\n\nThe fact that paranormal experts Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are folks who dealt with horrors in real life adds to the fear factor of James Wan's franchise starter, which focused on a Rhode Island family, their rundown farmhouse and some witchiness.\n\n35. 'Sinister' (2012)\n\nBefore writer/director Scott Derrickson did a Marvel-ous \"Doctor Strange,\" he went full-on creepy video. Ethan Hawke's true-crime writer finds a box of Super 8 home movies in his attic, playing them and consequently putting his family in grave danger thanks to the appearance of a Babylonian deity named Bughuul.\n\n34. 'The House of the Devil' (2009)\n\nDirector Ti West's ode to 1970s and '80s horror is slow-burn dread. A college student (Jocelin Donahue) gets a baby-sitting offer she can't refuse, which leads to utter satanic insanity for the last 25 minutes. Fun fact: Greta Gerwig shows up in one of her early roles.\n\n33. 'Split' (2017)\n\nWhile it was ultimately revealed as a secret sequel to \"Unbreakable,\" M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller stands on its own, thanks to James McAvoy's troubled Kevin Wendell Crumb, who has more than 20 distinct personalities and kidnaps a girl (Anya Taylor-Joy) who's just as damaged as he is.\n\nGrace (Samara Weaving) gets covered in blood and guts but still manages a grin in \"Ready or Not.\" (Photo: FOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES)\n\n32. 'Ready or Not' (2019)\n\nThe newest flick makes the list by being so darn enjoyable, and that's maybe not something you expect with buckets of blood, servants getting shot in the head, a catchily kooky Victrola tune and a newlywed bride (Samara Weaving) trying to literally survive a night with her evil in-laws.\n\n31. 'Inside' (2007)\n\nThe French fright fest features a very pregnant widow (Alysson Paradis) who sees her home invaded on Christmas Eve by a mysterious woman in black (Beatrice Dalle) dead set on cutting her baby out with some scissors. Buckle up for fiery mayhem and a \"birthing\" scene that's hard to even fathom.\n\n30. 'The Invitation' (2016)\n\nKaryn Kusama's cult horror comedy \"Jennifer's Body\" was ahead of its time, but the director returned with this twisty treat, which makes the boring dinner party anything but. Logan Marshall-Green stars as a man invited to a shindig by his ex-wife, the revelry goes awry and you're left with jaw on the floor by a whopper of a last scene.\n\nLukas and Elias Schwarz star as twins who face a mother not quite herself in \"Goodnight Mommy.\" (Photo: Radius)\n\n29. 'Goodnight Mommy' (2015)\n\nFull of dread and melancholy, the Austrian import flips the creepy-kid script a bit by centering on two boys (Elias and Lukas Schwarz) who wonder whether their mom (Susanne Wuest), whose head is wrapped in bandages after facial surgery, is actually their mom.\n\n28. 'Happy Death Day' (2017)\n\nSo what if it's a slasher-movie \"Groundhog Day\"? The enchanting time-hopper puts a sorority girl (Jessica Rothe) through her paces as she's forced to re-live the same day of getting murdered by a serial killer in a baby mask until she figures out whodunit.\n\n27. 'Don\u2019t Breathe' (2016)\n\nAnother intriguing take on the home-invasion trope has three young robbers wanting fast cash and breaking into the house of a blind Gulf War vet (Stephen Lang) harboring some seriously dark secrets of his own. (You'll never look at a turkey baster the same way ever again. Promise.)\n\nSharni Vinson isn't your average horror-movie victim in \"You're Next.\" (Photo: COREY RANSBURG/LIONSGATE)\n\n26. 'You\u2019re Next' (2013)\n\nThis funny and vicious tweak of the \"final girl\" trope is an underrated gem starring Sharni Vinson as Erin, an Aussie woman visiting her boyfriend's family reunion. Soon enough, the house is surrounded by dangerous folks in animal masks, but it turns out Erin is more than ready and able for a fight.\n\n25. 'Train to Busan' (2016)\n\nWas the title \"Zombies on a Train\" already taken? An undead apocalypse emerges outside as well as inside a Korean bullet train headed for \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Busan, and avoiding infection is a bigger problem for passengers than travel delays. Like \"World War Z\" meets \"Speed,\" in the best way possible.\n\n24. 'Us' (2019)\n\nJordan Peele weaves in Bible references, metaphorical rabbits and Hands Across America with the story of a family fending off their relentless killer doppelgangers. And look out, Freddy Krueger, because Lupita Nyong'o's Red makes a strong case for sharpest horror villain.\n\nSheila Vand is a cool skateboarding Iranian vampire in \"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.\" (Photo: Vice Films)\n\n23. 'A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night' (2014)\n\nThere's wonderful originality, a Western bent and style to spare in Ana Lily Amirpour's super-cool black-and-white piece about an Iranian vampire (Sheila Vand) who skateboards around Bad City and attacks men who mistreat women.\n\n22. 'Insidious' (2011)\n\nFor those who never got into James Wan's gory \"Saw\" extravaganzas, the first outing in the haunted house series makes use of old-school scare tactics, plus introduces an interesting interdimensional mythology and Lin Shaye as a kind but determined demonologist.\n\n21. 'Starry Eyes' (2014)\n\nThe deal-with-the-devil nature of Hollywood gets the scary-movie treatment with Alexandra Essoe as a waitress and struggling actress who will do whatever it takes to be a film star. She later realizes the wicked sacrifices, physical and otherwise, that need to be made in the intriguing exploration of power and celebrity.\n\nRed (Nicolas Cage) prepares for war by forging a destructive ax in the fantasy thriller \"Mandy.\" (Photo: RLJE FILMS)\n\n20. 'Mandy' (2018)\n\nA wacked-out, crazily emotional Nicolas Cage wields axes and a chain saw in heavy-metal fashion as a logger who goes on a fantastical revenge quest against the religious cult that killed his main squeeze. The best part is it's just as awesome watching that all unfold onscreen as it is typing that sentence.\n\n19. 'The Conjuring 2' (2016)\n\nAs good as the original film is, the sequel manages to outdo it with a religious theme and possessed girl a la \"The Exorcist,\" mining a couple of the Warrens' real cases (the Amityville Horror and the Enfield poltergeist) and unleashing some extra ghoulish delights.\n\n18. 'Raw' (2017)\n\nYoungsters navigating growing up and social anxiety have long been horror staples, though this French coming-of-age drama is a cannibalistic one. Garance Marillier stars as a strict vegetarian and vet-school student forced to eat a rabbit kidney, which unlocks a whole new appetite not kosher in most circles.\n\nDance rookie Susie (Dakota Johnson) gets a plum role in Luca Guadagnino's new \"Suspiria.\" (Photo: AMAZON STUDIOS)\n\n17. 'Suspiria' (2018)\n\nA rare remake that surpasses the original \u2013 in this case, Dario Argento's 1977 classic \u2013 in story if not style. The witchy tale of a young rookie (Dakota Johnson) learning a coven secretly runs her famous dance company is one of feminine strength and schlocky carnage.\n\n16. 'A Dark Song' (2017)\n\nA grieving mom (Catherine Walker) mourning her murdered son rents a Welsh house for a black magic ritual and recruits an oddball occultist (Steve Oram) to summon a guardian angel for a mission of revenge. Sure, it's weird and spiteful but also beautiful, thoughtful and surprising.\n\n15. 'What We Do in the Shadows'\n\n(2015)\n\nThe lesson of Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's blood-sucking mockumentary? Life's hard out there for a vampire. Hilarity ensues when ancient fanged friends struggle with the hazards of modern living, such as chores and problematic roommates. They're just like us!\n\nWyatt Oleff (from left), Finn Wolfhard, Chosen Jacobs, Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis and Jeremy Ray Taylor play the heroic kids of \"It.\" (Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\n14. 'It' (2017)\n\nThe first chapter adapting Stephen King's epic tome introduced cinema to the Losers' Club, a bunch of outcast Maine kids who find acceptance in friendship and, oh, yeah, have to deal with a demonic clown. Bill Skarsgard's creeptastic Pennywise is just the cherry on top of the rich coming-of-age sundae.\n\n13. 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004)\n\nFrom LPs being used as zombie-killing weapons to the best Queen needle drop in movies (sorry, \"Wayne's World\"), Edgar Wright's horror comedy sent up the undead just as they were starting to lumber all over pop culture. Its real secret sauce, though: Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as lovable best friends.\n\n12. 'The Cabin in the Woods' (2012)\n\nName a horror trope and it's referenced in this genre-deconstructing wonder. Heck, there's even a whiteboard that names them all in the clever thriller, which starts with teens venturing to a cabin in the woods before revealing a whole other conceit underneath, metaphorically and literally.\n\nLina Leandersson plays a vampire girl in the Swedish film \"Let the Right One In.\" (Photo: MAGNOLIA PICTURES)\n\n11. 'Let the Right One In' (2008)\n\nThere is an insightful sweetness to the Swedish love story of sorts between a bullied 12-year-old boy and his new friend, a protective female vampire. When she states simply, \"I am not a girl,\" there's a weight and sadness but also understanding behind it.\n\n10. 'The Devil\u2019s Backbone' (2001)\n\nGuillermo del Toro has risen to the annals of horror mastery in recent years, but there's a little bit of a Spielbergian nature to his ghostly tale set in the Spanish Civil War, about an orphan boy seeking the secrets of his school and the dead kid he frequently sees.\n\n9. 'Black Swan' (2010)\n\nIf \"Suspiria\" didn't already prove artistry was hell, the insane world of ballet does the job here. Natalie Portman's main character cracks under the psychological and physical pressures of being a prima ballerina in \"Swan Lake\" and goes dancing on the dark side.\n\nMaika Monroe plays a cursed young woman with a shapeshifting stalker in \"It Follows.\" (Photo: Radius)\n\n8. 'It Follows' (2015)\n\nMaika Monroe stars as a young woman who just can't shake a shape-shifting menace who takes different human forms and is a source of constant stress. This isn't an ordinary antagonist, though \u2013 in fact, she's hounded by a sexually transmitted curse, a high concept that gives the eerie thriller extraordinary, infectious life.\n\n7. 'The Babadook' (2014)\n\nThings aren't great in the emotionally fraught household of a single mother and a young boy. And it's hard to say what makes things worse: Mom's deteriorating mental state or the appearance of Mr. Babadook, an expressionistic storybook monster with a top hat and intimidating chompers.\n\n6. 'Hereditary' (2018)\n\nAri Aster's disturbing debut would be impressive if you just stop at the spectacular implosion of a loving family and Toni Collette's heartbreaking performance. It rises to all-time status when you factor in all the occult leanings, horrifying imagery and a demon king thrown in for good measure.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya stars as a young black man who finds out the sinister reason he was invited to meet his girlfriend's family in \"Get Out.\" (Photo: UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\n5. 'Get Out' (2017)\n\nDaniel Kaluuya's teary, wide-eyed shocked face, as his character enters the abominable Sunken Place courtesy of his white girlfriend's totally evil parents, is one of the most indelible horror-film sights this millennium. And filmmaker Jordan Peele earns instant-classic status with his socially relevant (and totally rousing) tackling of modern racism.\n\n4. 'The Witch' (2016)\n\nThe unnerving look at 17th-century paranoia is seen through the eyes of a young New England teenager (Anya Taylor-Joy). Her baby brother goes mysteriously missing on her watch and she's suspected of witchcraft. Come for the downward spiral of hellish despair, stay for macabre goat Black Phillip and the ominous climax.\n\nKwak Do-Won (right) is a Korean cop dad who worries about how a mysterious infection might affect his family in \"The Wailing.\" (Photo: Well Go USA Entertainment)\n\n3. 'The Wailing' (2016)\n\nGhosts? Check. The undead? Check. Hair-raising possessed kids? Check and check. Over the course of 2\u00bd hours, the Korean masterpiece goes a lot of different places following a bumbling cop worried about his family when a dangerous infection turns his neighbors into monsters.\n\n2. '28 Days Later' (2003)\n\nThe best zombie movie that didn't involve George Romero, period. From the harrowing shot of Cillian Murphy waking from a coma to find a bizarrely deserted London to the rage-filled creatures who run instead of lumber, it bleakly captures post-apocalyptic life in a brutally realistic fashion that other films strive to but just can't.\n\n1. 'Kill List' (2012)\n\nIn Ben Wheatley's brilliant and blistering work, a British soldier returns home and embarks on a career as a hit man, finding strange little details while on his various jobs. Totally sounds like a normal ol' crime thriller, right? Hoo boy, by the end it is not at all, and to reveal anything else would be downright felonious.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/09/05/best-horror-movies-21st-century-definitively-ranked/2194687001/", "description": "The 21st century so far has given us scary movies with an artful bent, such as \"Get Out\" and \"Hereditary.\" The best horror movies since 2001, ranked.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
