(AP) - Vermont mental health officials are moving forward with plans for a secure mental health facility that will replace a temporary, seven-bed location in Middlesex.\n\nIt\u2019s hoped construction can begin by spring on a 16-bed facility to replace the Middlesex location, which was constructed after the 2011 closure of the Vermont State Hospital in Waterbury due to flooding from Tropical Storm Irene.\n\nThe most severe cases are treated at the Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital in Berlin, but it has a 25-bed capacity.\n\nVermont Mental Health Commissioner Sarah Squirrel tells WCAX-TV the system needs a centrally located facility that provides a lower-level of care than the Berlin hospital, but can still provide secure treatment.\n\nA new facility is estimated to cost more than $4.5 million.\n\nNo location has been chosen yet.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vermont mental health officials are moving forward with plans for a secure mental health facility that will replace a temporary, seven-bed location in Middlesex.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
