Besides Bernie, of course.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time lately that she\u2019s complained about their meanness, for what it\u2019s worth.\n\n.@marwilliamson: \u201cWhat does it say that the conservatives are nicer to me? I\u2019m a serious lefty but they are so \u2014 I understand why people on the right called them godless \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s like, I didn\u2019t think the left was as mean as the right, they are.\u201d pic.twitter.com/0iXkWPRdAW \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 12, 2019\n\nShe knows one of the reasons for the disparate treatment, as she explained to Eric Bolling in a subsequent interview (which you can watch in full here): \u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t have to be attacking me now, I\u2019m in a Democratic primary, so Republicans are like, \u2018Hi, Marianne!\u2019 And some people on the left are working for other candidates, you know how that goes.\u201d She\u2019s an agent of chaos in the Democratic race, a wild card offering progressive policies packaged with New Age warnings about \u201cdark psychic forces\u201d in the White House. Righties naturally crave Democratic electoral chaos, Democrats naturally abhor it. Ergo, righties are warmer to her than lefties are.\n\nBut there\u2019s a point to be made here too about righties being more open to religion \u2014 or \u201cspirituality,\u201d in Williamson\u2019s case \u2014 than lefties are, with some caveats. The numbers from Pew:\n\nMore Republicans signal religious/spiritual interest than Democrats do no matter how you phrase the questions, although the gap often isn\u2019t as wide as you\u2019d think. In the table above, for instance, the Republican advantage over Dems among those who say religion is very or somewhat important to their lives is 12 points \u2014 noteworthy, but not overwhelming. When asked if they\u2019re absolutely or fairly certain that God exists, 90 percent of Republicans say yes but so do 76 percent of Democrats. Steer the questions away from God/religion and towards vaguer \u201cspiritual\u201d signposts and the gap narrows. Among those who say they \u201cfeel a sense of spiritual peace and wellbeing\u201d at least once or twice a month, Republicans lead just 77/72.\n\nThere are some notable divergences, though.\n\nAsked where they\u2019re most likely to seek guidance on right and wrong, 44 percent of Republicans say religion. Just 25 percent of Democrats do. Go figure righties might take appeals about \u201cdark psychic forces\u201d more seriously than lefties.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s another important distinction here. Although it\u2019s true that most Democrats are generally religious, it is not true that religious belief is distributed uniformly across demographic lines within the Democratic Party. An eye-popping result from another Pew survey:\n\nJust one-third of white Democrats believe in God as described in the Bible. Nearly as many, 21 percent, don\u2019t believe in God at all. And it\u2019s Very Online white Democrats, of course, who are writing most of the liberal commentary on the presidential race and who are heavily invested in Sanders and Warren as instruments of a social-justice revolution that can overtake America if only the rest of the field, which includes Williamson, will get out of their g-ddamned way already. (If Williamson thinks they\u2019ve been mean to her, she should ask Beto O\u2019Rourke how it felt to be targeted by Berniebros early in the race as a potential obstacle to socialism\u2019s final victory.) Of course the left\u2019s atheist-agnostic progressive pundit niche would have special contempt for someone like Williamson. They\u2019re the ones who are \u201cbeing mean\u201d to her, not Democrats generally.\n\nAnd in fairness to them, sometimes they\u2019re right to be. Not for religious reasons but for crankery like this.\n\nAnyway, she missed the cut for tonight\u2019s debate and has never polled much better than an asterisk despite her splashy performances at the first two debates, so she\u2019s effectively out of the race even though she technically remains in. From now on we\u2019ll have to get our fix of religion, progressive-style, from Pete Buttigieg, who seems to view Christianity chiefly as a political cudgel. Although given his polling lately, he might be headed for oblivion with Marianne soon enough.", "description": "\u201cI didn\u2019t think the left was as mean as the right, they are.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/w-4.jpg"}
