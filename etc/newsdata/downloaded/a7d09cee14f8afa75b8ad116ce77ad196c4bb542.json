However, on Wednesday, more than 1 500 officers returned to the area in show of force.\n\nAmong other items seized during the second raid were police rifles, pistols and handguns, some of which were made in Israel.\n\nOn Monday, dozens of shop owners camped outside the court in support of their peers who were due to appear.\n\nBy midday, both the group of police officers and the arrested protestors had not yet appeared as court officials were still processing dockets related to the cases, the NPA told News24.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
