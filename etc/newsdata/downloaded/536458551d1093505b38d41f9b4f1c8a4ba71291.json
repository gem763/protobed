The report did not say what national flag the vessel was\n\nflying.\n\nIran, which has some of the world's cheapest fuel due to\n\nheavy state subsidies, has been fighting rampant fuel smuggling\n\noverland to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf Arab\n\nstates. It has frequently seized boats it says are being used\n\nfor smuggling fuel in the Gulf. The incidents come at a time of tensions between Iran and\n\nthe West in the Gulf that have been rising since the United\n\nStates exited world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran last\n\nyear and reimposed sanctions.\n\nWhile Iranian media reports say an estimated 10 million\n\nlitres of fuel are smuggled per day, Tehran has been promoting\n\nlegal gasoline exports through its energy bourse.\n\nGasoline sales hit a record high of $72 million last week on\n\nthe Iran Energy Exchange (IRENEX) for exports to neighbouring\n\ncountries, according to state TV.\n\nThe stand-off between Iran and the United States triggered\n\nby Washington's withdrawal from the nuclear deal in May last\n\nyear has stirred fears of a Gulf war with global repercussions.\n\nIn July, Iran seized a British oil tanker near the Strait of\n\nHormuz for alleged marine violations, two weeks after British\n\nforces detained an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar accused of\n\ntaking oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.\n\nThe Iranian tanker was later released. Iran this week freed\n\nseven of the 23 crew members of the British-flagged tanker.\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1-Iran seizes ship with Filipino crew for alleged fuel smuggling in Gulf", "description": "UPDATE 1-Iran seizes ship with Filipino crew for alleged fuel smuggling in Gulf", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
