Many. Bangers.\n\nHowever, there is one track in particular that John really wasn\u2019t a fan of, Run For Your Life.\n\nIn fact, the late star \u2013 who died in 1980, aged 40 \u2013 went so far as to brand the track, which appears on the Rubber Soul album, his \u2018least favourite Beatles song\u2019.\n\nJudging by the fact they made well over 100 songs, that\u2019s saying a lot.\n\nJohn Lennon hated Run For Your Life (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe song borrows a lyric from Elvis\u2019 Baby Let\u2019s Play House, which references wanting to kill a girlfriend if she\u2019s unfaithful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd speaking about the line, he admitted he \u2018knocked off\u2019 the whole thing.\n\n\u2018Run for Your Life, I always hated, you know,\u2019 he told Rolling Stone back in 1970. \u2018I never liked Run For Your Life, because it was a song I just knocked off.\n\n\u2018It was inspired from \u2013 this is a very vague connection \u2013 from Baby Let\u2019s Play House. There was a line on it, I used to like specific lines from songs, \u201cI\u2019d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man\u201d \u2013 so I wrote it around that but I didn\u2019t think it was that important.\u2019\n\nBut while the song has gone on to divide fans around the world, John revealed there was one member of the Fab Four who liked it \u2013 George.\n\nDiscussing the track three years later, he added: \u2018Just a sort of throwaway song of mine that I never thought much of, but it was always a favourite of George\u2019s.\u2019\n\nWhile Paul branded it a \u2018bit of a macho song\u2019.\n\nHe does have a point\u2026\n\nThe Fab Four recorded some of the most recognised music in history (Picture: Getty)\n\nPaul and Ringo recently got back into the studio together to cover one of John\u2019s songs, as a tribute to the late star \u2013 who was assassinated in December, 1980.\n\nAnnouncing his version of Grow Old With Me, Ringo said: \u2018I sang it the best that I could.\n\n\u2018I do well up when I think of John this deeply. And I\u2019ve done my best. We\u2019ve done our best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The other good thing is that I really wanted Paul to play on it, and he said yes.\n\n\u2018Paul came over and he played bass and sings a little bit on this with me. So John\u2019s on it in a way. I\u2019m on it and Paul\u2019s on it.\u2019\n\nRingo isn\u2019t leaving George out, as a line from Here Comes The Sun \u2013 which the late star penned \u2013 is also used.\n\nHe added: \u2018So in a way, it\u2019s the four of us.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
