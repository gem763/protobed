You did it!' the man in the car says.\n\n'First man I've ever seen kill a wombat on foot, bro.'\n\nThe Wombat Awareness Organisation has since created a petition to get justice for the killed animal.\n\n'This is allowed under the Native Title Act and accepted as traditional hunting however this contradicts Part 3 section 13 of the Animal Welfare Act,' the petition reads.\n\n'We are asking for all native animals to be protected under the Animal Welfare Act and for this perpetrator to be prosecuted.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Wombat Awareness Organisation for comment.", "description": "The video was taken on\u00a0South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, showing the off-duty officer repeatedly throwing rocks at the wombat's head while being encouraged by a friend.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/02/19234370-0-image-a-31_1570066856274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
