He allegedly did it to pay off the ring and flowers.", "language": "en", "text": "Then, the 36-year-old got a text from his fiancee.\n\n\u201cDid you just rob a bank?\u201d she asked on Friday, according to the local sheriff in Trinity County, Tex., about 100 miles north of Houston.\n\nAs it turns out, police say he had, before leaving his disguise on the side of the road and turning himself in later on Friday afternoon \u2014 in a case that\u2019s the latest viral instance of errant grooms charged with crimes on the eve of their wedding days.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Bumpous had planned his heist in advance or committed it in the spur of the moment, Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace told The Washington Post. But in a video on Facebook, he recounted how the man ended up in handcuffs the day before he was set to walk down the aisle.\n\nAD\n\nWallace said that Bumpous had lost his job heading up EMS services in nearby Houston County about nine months ago. Ahead of his wedding ceremony, the alleged thief had told his fiancee that all the expenses \u2014 the flowers, the wooden venue deep in the piney woods, and especially the $3,200 ring she wanted \u2014 had been taken care of.\n\nBut he still had thousands to pay off, and the big day was getting close.\n\nAD\n\nSo on Friday, Bumpous allegedly drove across the county line into Groveton, an East Texas town of about 1,000 people. At around 11:30 a.m., police said he strolled through the entrance to the Citizens State Bank, a one-story, green-roofed building in the center of town. Without a mask or any other kind of disguise, Bumpous demanded that the two bank tellers empty their drawers, threatening that he had a gun.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt,\u201d he told the staff, according to an affidavit provided to The Post.\n\nBumpous allegedly walked out of the bank with more than $7,000 in cash stuffed into gray Walmart bags. As local schools were placed on lockdown, police said Bumpous made his escape in his gray Ford Focus, driving away on forest and dirt roads out of town.\n\nAD\n\nHis first stop was about 20 miles north at the Cochino Lodge near Kennard, Tex., where he was due to be married the next day. Bumpous handed the staff $2,600 in mostly $20 bills, the affidavit said, before leaving the lakeside wedding venue to go purchase a ring for the Saturday celebration.\n\n\u201cHe basically stated that he was getting married tomorrow,\u201d Wallace said in the video, \u201cso he didn\u2019t have enough money for a wedding ring that he wanted to buy and he needed to pay for the wedding venue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt some point during his drive, Bumpous had taken off his clothes \u2014 a black hat with matching T-shirt and pants \u2014 and dumped them on the side of the road. But that wasn\u2019t enough to disguise himself. In the meantime, the sheriff\u2019s office had released a photo of the man that was captured on security camera footage, and asked the public for help identifying the suspect.\n\nAD\n\nAt least one person instantly recognized the unmasked robber: His wife-to-be, who texted him saying she had seen his face circulating around social media, the sheriff said. Her name has not been made public\n\nAt first, Bumpous denied he was the man in the photo. But when he received a screen shot of the alert with his own face, his fiancee convinced him to turn himself into the authorities.\n\nSo instead of going ring shopping, Bumpous drove to the Houston County Courthouse, where he confessed to the crime and was arrested about two hours after his robbery. Police said they later found a loaded .380 pistol in his car, according to the affidavit.\n\nAD\n\nWallace told The Post that the alleged thief was cooperative and quiet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m caught. I did it,\u201d Bumpous told him, the sheriff said. \u201cIt was stupid, and here I am.\u201d\n\nShe caught her fiance sexually assaulting a bridesmaid, police say. They got married anyway.\n\nThe whole ordeal seemed to serve as good marketing opportunity for Wallace, who recounted the episode in a Facebook video from inside his car while donning a cowboy hat and sunglasses. Bumpous\u2019 theft would mark the start of an unusually busy weekend for his office, he said, with the rare occurrence of a murder in Trinity County to follow over the weekend.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come to Trinity County and commit your crime,\u201d Wallace said in the video, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to find you as quick as we can. We\u2019re not going to stop until we do and we\u2019re going to put you in jail.\u201d\n\nBumpous, who was charged with robbery, is being held on a $300,000 bond, according to jail records. Plans for the wedding, which did not happen as scheduled on Saturday, have yet to be determined, the sheriff said.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cDid you just rob a bank?\u201d his fiancee texted him, just as he was paying off their wedding venue for the next day.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a-oywlrGRntqdrNWbb7jjzViofU=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-08-2019/t_39f50eeeee254a54b9e73138b9559240_name_Screen_Shot_2019_10_08_at_6_01_37_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
