One armchair baker sees if she can better them\n\nAs an inveterate armchair baker, who laughs knowingly as raw dough gets the Paul Hollywood finger or unset fillings ooze, I watched enthusiastically as every single contestant failed the technical challenge in the latest episode of The Great British Bake Off. Hollywood described the efforts to make maids of honour \u2013 a kind of curd-filled tart \u2013 as \u201cawful\u201d. But how would I get on when I gave this recipe \u2013 beloved of Henry VIII \u2013 a try?\n\nI begin by boiling milk then adding vinegar: everyone\u2019s favourite way to start a dessert. This lumpy horror should be separated using a muslin cloth. Obviously, I don\u2019t have any muslins: it\u2019s not the 1890s. I use a grubby cloth that came with a pot of cleanser. Perhaps any essential oils will enhance the flavour? The face cloth is definitively too small to hold 200g of hot, separated vinegar milk, but I catch it with a sieve.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A not-so promising start \u2026 Photograph: Emma Beddington/The Guardian\n\nThe rough puff pastry is confusing: the instructions are more GCSE geometry (30x12 centimetre rectangle, rotate 90\u00b0, find X) than baking. I confess I don\u2019t use all the butter because it feels terribly wasteful: these tarts will surely be disgusting and I respect butter. Next is lemon curd: reaching for my manky, back-of-the-fridge lemons, I spill vinegar everywhere. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have time to mop up. Ah, the heady scent of baking: lemon, boiled milk, vinegar.\n\nI am determined not to make the same mistake as Bake Off\u2019s Priya, whose dreamy curd-stirring led to disaster. I do anyway, and end up way behind schedule to roll out my pastry. Rereading the instructions, I notice I was supposed to fold it repeatedly over the past 20 minutes: \u201cTOO LATE FOR THAT, PRU,\u201d I hiss. Grated butter leaks out alarmingly as I try to cut out rounds using a smoothie cup. Putting the cases in to blind-bake, I realise I have misread the oven temperature and whack it up to 230C.\n\nMaking the filling involves whisking my unholy cheese \u2013 a sinister, pale mass that looks like something the government might distribute to nursing mothers after 31 October \u2013 with eggs, sugar and lemon zest. It looks as appetising as you would imagine homemade sweetened vinegar curds might.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, I attempt a rose template to decorate the top. I am interrupted by the smell of burning: the pastry cases have somehow scorched in half their allotted time. I add the filling. Fifteen minutes left.\n\nI take out my maids of shame, dust with icing sugar, and taste. Verdict: they are edible. Perhaps even delicious, if you love overdone pastry, lemon and vinegary cheese. My tongue is burnt, my kitchen trashed and my pride in tatters. I feel fresh respect for the GBBO bakers \u2013 and new sympathy for Henry VIII.", "description": "This week, contestants on the Channel 4 show all failed to make a decent curd tart \u2013 the first time everyone has flunked the technical.
