The Nasdaq Composite index COMP, +0.26% gained 14 points, or 0.2%, to 8,100.\n\nThe Dow saw its fifth straight gain Tuesday, rising 73.92 points, or 0.3%, to end at 26,909.43 \u2014 marking its longest winning streak since a six-day run that ended on June 10. The S&P 500 eked out a gain of 0.96 point to end at 2,979.39, while the Nasdaq shed 3.28 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 8,084.16\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nWhile markets have appeared calm on the surface, investors are watching to see if a heavy internal out of previously market-leading momentum shares in favor of previously out-of-favor value stocks \u2014 accompanied by declines in defensive sectors that were outperforming for several week \u2014 will continue Wednesday.\n\nMomentum strategies focus on buying shares that have previously gained and have offered outsize returns for much of the current bull market, while value shares have lagged behind.\n\nTuesday\u2019s action saw the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF MTUM, +0.04% fall 1.5%, while the iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF VLUE, +0.23% rallied 1.4%. So far this week, MTUM is down 3.1% versus a 3.2% rise for VLUE.\n\nAlso see: Energy, financial stocks soar: Oversold bounce or the beginning of a breakout?\n\nSmall-cap shares have also rallied, with the Russell 2000 RUT, +0.13% rising 1.2% Tuesday to give it a 2.5% rise so far this week versus a largely flat performance for the large-cap S&P 500.\n\n\u201cFrom a technical perspective, the rally in small-caps is the most important development of the week, so far, as the Russell 2000 hit a five-week high outperforming its large-cap peers,\u201d said Ken Berman, strategist at Gorilla Trades, in a note.\n\nThe Russell 2000 has lagged behind the broader market for several months and remains more than 10% below its all-time high despite a recovery over the past couple of weeks, he said, noting that this weeks\u2019 move has seen it move back above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages \u2014 viewed as measures of short and longer-term momentum, respectively \u2014 for the first time since late-July. If the Russell remains \u201crelatively strong,\u201d major indexes could be on track for a round of all-time highs, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury prices remained under pressure Wednesday, driving up yields, after an August rally. The rebound in yields reflected easing worries over the U.S.-China trade battle, at least for now, as officials from both countries prepare for renewed talks. Potentially boosting sentiment Wednesday was a Chinese decision to exempt some products from retaliatory import tariffs announced in August.\n\nInvestors are also looking for the European Central Bank to deliver an interest rate cut and potentially other measures when policy makers meet Thursday, while the Federal Reserve is expected to deliver another rate cut when it meets next week.\n\nPresident Trump renewed his calls for the Federal Reserve to aggressively cut interest rates, arguing that the Fed Funds rate should be cut \u201cto zero or less.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nWholesale price growth accelerated slightly in August, with the producer price index rising 0.1%, versus a flat reading expected by economists polled by MarketWatch. Wholesale price growth rose year-over-year at a 1.8% rate, versus a 1.7% advance in July.\n\nData on July wholesale inventories are due at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of GameStop Corp. GME, -16.96% tumbled 20% after the video-game retailer reported a second-quarter loss of more than $400 million Thursday evening, driven largely by a $363.9 million goodwill impairment charge, while missing expectations for earnings and sales when excluding the one-time cost.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.42% stock could be in focus Wednesday, after a report that the FTC is investigating Amazon\u2019s third-party seller marketplace to determine whether it is using its market power to harm competition. Shares fell 0.5% Wednesday morning.\n\nShares of ride hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, -0.12% and Lyft Inc. LYFT, +1.06% could be in focus Wednesday after the California Senate passed a bill that would likely force the companies to classify their drivers as employees, rather than contractors. The bill is expected to be soon signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Uber shares were down 1%, while Lyft shares advanced 0.7% early Wednesday.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.10% rose 4 basis points to 1.75% Wednesday, extending a selloff in bonds that has driven the 10-year yield 12.4% higher week-to-date. Bond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nIn commodities markets, the price crude oil CLV19, +0.64% rose 0.2% to about $57.50 a barrel, on weekly data showing a drop in U.S. inventories, while gold prices GCZ19, -0.14% edged 0.2% lower to around $1,496 an ounce. The U.S. dollar DXY, +0.32%, meanwhile, edged higher against a basket of its peers.\n\nIn Asia overnight Wednesday, stocks were mixed, with the China CSI 300 l 000300, -0.74% osing 0.7%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index HSI, +1.78% added 1.8% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, +0.96% rose 1%.
