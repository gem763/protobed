Gavin Newsom (D) has come out in support of AB-5, legislation that would reclassify many gig economy workers from independent contractors to employees, guaranteeing them labor protections and benefits \u2015 and potentially upending the business models of tech companies like Uber and Lyft.\n\nIn an opinion piece in The Sacramento Bee on Monday, which was Labor Day, Newsom said he was \u201cproud to be supporting\u201d Assembly Bill 5, which details the conditions under which a worker should be considered an employee \u2015 and therefore entitled to benefits like a minimum wage, unemployment and disability insurance, and a right to form a union.\n\n\u201cOur economy has stopped working for working people ... Corporate profits have gone through the roof while worker pay has remained in the basement,\u201d Newsom wrote in the piece. \u201cContributing to this imbalance is the misclassification of workers, where companies eager to save on labor costs identify workers as \u2018independent contractors\u2019 rather than employees.\u201d\n\nRideshare companies Uber and Lyft have hundreds of thousands of drivers in California, who are currently considered independent contractors. The companies have been lobbying against the legislation, as their bottom lines would be dramatically affected by having drivers newly classified as employees for whom they\u2019d have to pay additional benefits and protections.\n\nHundreds of Uber and Lyft drivers with the organizing group Gig Workers Rising protested throughout California last month, demanding AB-5\u2019s passage and a union for drivers.\n\nThe legislation overwhelmingly passed in the Assembly in May and is set to next be voted on in the state Senate, after which it will go to Newsom\u2019s desk.\n\nPutting power in the hands of working people has never been more critical than now.\n\n\n\nWe must hold true to our values and give a real voice to all workers everywhere.https://t.co/qaPkFzksLy \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) September 3, 2019\n\nExactly how the law would affect rideshare companies and their drivers when applied in practice is still unclear. The legislation is based on a 2018 California Supreme Court decision in the case of Dynamex Operations, which established an \u201cABC\u201d test for classifying workers as employees.\n\nWith AB-5 expected to pass, Uber, Lyft and other companies have committed tens of millions to back a ballot initiative, which would push a separate classification for rideshare drivers.\n\nThe companies have proposed providing certain protections that drivers have been demanding, like a minimum pay floor, as well as supporting \u201csectoral\u201d bargaining, which would allow drivers across the industry to join together and negotiate better conditions from their companies.\n\nIn their push to keep drivers as independent contractors, the companies have also been spreading the idea that if drivers were made employees, they would lose their flexible scheduling.\n\nOne driver organizer, Annette Rivero, told TechCrunch in August that there was \u201cno truth\u201d to the companies\u2019 claim that the legislation would affect drivers\u2019 flexibility.\n\nA Lyft spokesperson acknowledged to HuffPost that there was nothing \u201cexplicitly\u201d in the law that would affect drivers\u2019 flexibility, but added that the \u201cpractical reality\u201d was that due to the \u201cbigger financial burden\u201d of having drivers as employees, the companies would likely not maintain scheduling flexibility.\n\nAsked what Newsom would be willing to support in potential future talks with Uber and Lyft around how their drivers were classified, the governor\u2019s office told HuffPost they wouldn\u2019t \u201cspeculate on hypotheticals,\u201d adding that the governor has \u201cmade his priority clear \u2014 fairness for workers, higher wages, meaningful benefits, and the ability to organize.\u201d", "description": "The legislation could force tech companies to consider workers who are now independent contractors as employees and provide them with additional benefits.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ee5a03b00007902cc1010.jpeg?cache=33qzgleo3c&ops=1778_1000"}
