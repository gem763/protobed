USA TODAY\n\nFor most Americans, filing their tax returns for the 2018 tax year is a distant and unpleasant memory. Even though the majority of taxpayers got their returns filed by the mid-April deadline nearly six months ago, a few hoped Congress might get around to extending some much-loved tax breaks that have been popular over the years.\n\nThose hopes are close to getting dashed. Time and time again, lawmakers failed to get any forward momentum on tax extenders.\n\nHave you outgrown your credit card?: Here are the 4 telling signs\n\nMake your golden years enjoyable: 3 retirement rules to live by\n\nQuestion: What are tax extenders?\n\nAnswer: Tax extenders are provisions that give tax incentives to taxpayers on certain items for a limited period of time. Temporary tax breaks come about because the federal government has to account for the long-term budgetary impact of any changes to tax laws. It's more expensive to pass a tax break that will extend permanently than it is to have it be in effect for a single year. Therefore, some tax breaks get passed on a temporary basis, and it's up to Congress to decide year in and year out whether to renew them.\n\nTypically, the timeline for considering extending these tax breaks is in late December, trying to get things in under the wire before the year ends. Getting things done this late puts pressure on the Internal Revenue Service to work those fixes into their tax forms and instructions to taxpayers. Sometimes, negotiations slip into early January, but as long as they're done relatively quickly, taxpayers can take the newly renewed provisions into account by the time they file their returns.\n\nQ: Which tax breaks could disappear?\n\nA: Many popular tax breaks expired for the 2018 tax year, but a few stand out as being especially important for individual taxpayers. They include:\n\nThe tuition and fees deduction, which offered a deduction of up to $4,000 for qualifying educational expenses such as tuition and required fees and materials. Although many people who pay this type of educational expense can use alternative tax breaks such as the Lifetime Learning Credit, the deduction had less restrictive thresholds for income. That made it the only choice for certain taxpayers.\n\nTaxpayers were allowed to deduct the amounts they paid for private mortgage insurance in the same way they could mortgage interest on a primary residence. You had to itemize your deductions to take PMI expenses as a tax break, so higher standard deductions under tax law in 2018 made it less important for some. For many of those who weren't able to make sizable down payments of 20% or more on their homes and avoid private mortgage insurance, losing deductibility for PMI would have a significant financial impact on their home ownership decision \u2013 especially if a recession hits the housing market again.\n\nThose who had mortgage debt forgiven by a lender didn't have to treat the forgiven amount as income under a temporary tax provision that expired for 2018. Without the extender, those who face financial challenges and successfully work with their lender could have to deal with another obstacle in the form of the IRS.\n\nQ: Is there any hope?\n\nA: There have been measures introduced in the House and Senate over the course of this year, but few have seen a lot of attention. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 remains under consideration by the House, but there is no clearly set time frame for further deliberation. A Senate bill with the similar name of the Tax Extender and Disaster Relief Act of 2019 hasn't gotten an initial hearing, although some task forces made recommendations.\n\nIt seems unlikely that lawmakers will come to agreement on getting any changes made retroactively to apply to the 2018 tax year. That leaves Congress in the difficult position of trying to decide whether to bring back tax breaks that many have written off as dead. The more time goes by, the harder it'll be to win back the popular tax provisions millions used to their advantage for many years.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.
