While the service will feature major existing shows, like Friends, the company is also beginning to develop its roster of original content for subscribers. One of those new original projects is an adaptation of Circe, Madeline Miller\u2019s take on The Odyssey.\n\nHBO Max gave the project an eight-episode straight-to-series order, according to Deadline (via Tor.com). Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Jurassic World writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver will write and produce the series.\n\nWarnerMedia is lining up some big names for HBO Max. J.J. Abrams\u2019 Bad Robot studio might be signing a huge exclusivity deal with WarnerMedia. The platform has also greenlit a series called Dune: The Sisterhood, which will be a tie-in with Denis Villeneuve\u2019s upcoming adaptation of the classic science fiction novel, as well as an adaptation of Emily St. John Mandel\u2019s post-apocalyptic novel Station Eleven. Speaking to Deadline, HBO Max\u2019s head of content, Sarah Aubrey, says, \u201cCirce tells an epic story of love, loss, tragedy and immortal conflict, all through the eyes of a fierce female lens.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s novel came out last year to considerable acclaim and became a number one best-seller. It has been nominated for several awards, including the 2019 Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction. It\u2019s a feminist retelling of Homer\u2019s epic poem, told through the eyes of Circe, the sorceress who Odysseus encounters on his way home from Troy, who turns his crew into pigs.\n\nMiller told NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition that she read about the character in high school and was disappointed with how Circe was depicted. Odysseus overpowers her, and she gives in easily, begging for mercy. She wanted to explore the roots and potential of the character since she\u2019s the first witch to appear in Western literature. Miller explores how she became a powerful sorceress and provides more depth to the character than was seen in The Odyssey.", "description": "WarnerMedia is set to launch its forthcoming streaming service, HBO Max, later this year.
