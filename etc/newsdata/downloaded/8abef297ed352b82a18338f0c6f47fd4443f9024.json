Shares of U.S. energy companies surged, with Hess increasing 11%, Devon Energy adding 12% and Occidental Petroleum gaining 6%. Energy stocks have been crushed by low commodity prices and investors wary of oversaturated commodity markets. Saudi Arabia raced to restore crude production, as the attacks raised concerns about the security of supplies.\n\nGeneral Motors Co.\n\nEarly Monday, nearly 46,000 workers at General Motors walked off the job in the first strike at the auto maker in more than a decade, causing GM shares to fall 4.2%. The United Auto Workers called on employees to strike after negotiations for a new four-year labor agreement hit a standstill. Union negotiators are pressing the company to keep idled plants open, increase pay and benefits for less-senior workers and provide more job security for temporary workers. Industry analysts have estimated that the strike could dent GM\u2019s profit by between $50 million and $100 million daily. Companies that supply parts to GM have been forced to idle plants and lay off workers as the strike continues.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\n\nAmazon.com\u2019s shares took a hit after The Wall Street Journal reported the e-commerce giant has adjusted its product-search system to more prominently feature listings that are more profitable for the company. The change, which the company hasn\u2019t publicized and which was contested internally for years, is particularly sensitive as the U.S. and the European Union are examining Amazon\u2019s dual role as both marketplace operator and seller of its own branded products. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has argued that Amazon stifles small businesses by unfairly promoting its private-label products and underpricing competitors; Amazon has disputed this claim. Amazon shares fell 1.7% Monday.\n\nWalmart Inc.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos that Walmart likely discriminated against 178 female store workers by paying them less or denying them promotions because of their gender, The Journal reported Tuesday. The charges involve workers in more than 30 states. The EEOC documents ask Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a just resolution of the matter, which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart\u2019s practices, labor lawyers told the Journal. A Walmart spokesman said the company told the agency it is willing to engage in the conciliatory process. Shares rose 0.8% Tuesday.\n\nFedEx Corp.\n\nFedEx cut its earnings guidance, citing lower revenue projections for its global Express business, which caused the delivery giant\u2019s shares to fall the most in a decade on Wednesday. The slowdown for Express, which ferries packages and around the world by plane, is due in part to uncertainty around global trade. FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said during the company\u2019s earnings call that the company had expected a resolution to the U.S. trade dispute with China as it entered its current fiscal year, but the \u201crestoration of normalcy\u201d it hoped for hasn\u2019t taken place. Shares plummeted 13% Wednesday.\n\nGeneral Mills Inc.\n\nInvestors lost their appetite for General Mills Wednesday, with shares losing 0.9% after the packaged-food maker extended its sales slump. The company has struggled to rejuvenate growth amid tougher competition from trendier products and less expensive store brands. The company said it has seen poor demand for brands such as Yoplait yogurt and Nature Valley granola bars. Still, General Mills has made some progress: U.S. cereal sales rose 1% in the quarter, and its yogurt sales in the U.S. were flat, compared with double-digit declines in the past. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure we give consumers what they want,\u201d Chief Executive Jeff Harmening told the Journal.\n\nAT&T Inc.\n\nCould AT&T say goodbye to DirecTV? The telecom company is exploring parting with the unit, the Journal reported late Wednesday. AT&T\u2019s shrinking satellite business is under a microscope after activist investor Elliott Management Corp. disclosed a $3.2 billion stake and pushed for strategic changes in a letter to AT&T\u2019s board. Elliott has told investors that AT&T should unload DirecTV, The Journal has previously reported, and people familiar with the matter told the Journal that AT&T\u2019s CEO met with Elliott\u2019s portfolio manager on Tuesday to discuss streamlining. Shares gained 1.1% Thursday.\n\nWrite to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com", "description": "U.S. stock benchmarks fell on the week; here are seven of the biggest companies whose stocks moved on news.", "authors": ["Francesca Fontana", "Francesca.Fontana Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109461/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
