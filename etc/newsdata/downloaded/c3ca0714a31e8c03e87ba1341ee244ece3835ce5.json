Fairfax files defamation lawsuit against CBS for \u2026 interviewing his accusers", "language": "en", "text": "Sullivan be damned, it seems, along with common sense. Justin Fairfax, the embattled lieutenant governor of Virginia, has decided to fight back against allegations of sexual assault by suing CBS for defamation. Fairfax wants $400 million because its news division interviewed his accusers and didn\u2019t do \u201cdue diligence\u201d in preparing its questions, which is \u2026 not exactly defamation even outside of Sullivan:\n\nVirginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax on Thursday filed a lawsuit against CBS, alleging the network defamed him when it aired interviews earlier this year with two women who accused him of sexual assault. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia, demands $400 million for alleged defamation and \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d caused by the reporting. \u2026 The lawsuit contended that King \u201cfailed to ask basic questions\u201d of the two women, and \u201cfailed to separately investigate the allegations in advance of the airing date, and instead only spoke to Watson, Tyson and their representatives.\u201d Specifically, the lawsuit alleged that CBS \u201cfailed to interview other individuals who may have been able to confirm or contradict the allegations.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, Fairfax names one specific witness that CBS allegedly ignored \u2014 one of its own attorneys, whom Fairfax claims was a witness to one of the two alleged incidents. The lawsuit alleges that the attorney \u201chas stated to multiple people\u201d that Fairfax\u2019s encounter with Meredith Watson was consensual, not \u201crape or sexual[] assault.\u201d By not including that in its report, Fairfax alleges that CBS cooked their reports in an attempt to rehabilitate itself in the midst of its own sexual harassment scandals:\n\nThe lawsuit suggests CBS was trying to \u201calign itself on the side of perceived victims\u201d in light of sexual misconduct allegations against several high-profile CBS employees, including former CEO Leslie Moonves, who was ousted last September. \u201cIn light of its need to improve its public image and put these incidents in its rearview mirror by currying favor as a media outlet for accusations against public figures, the network sought to visibly align itself with alleged victims of sexual misconduct and, therefore, had a strong incentive to hype and air the false allegations by Watson and Tyson against Fairfax,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly a fun allegation, but it\u2019s essentially meaningless when suing a media outlet for defamation. Even if they gave Fairfax\u2019s accusers more coverage than one might have predicted for these reasons, it means nothing if CBS didn\u2019t defame Fairfax. It does mean, however, that the \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d discovery process should be beautiful, man, on both sides.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. CBS did not report the original allegations; those were made public by Fairfax\u2019s accusers. CBS did what news organizations do \u2014 conduct interviews with both women to allow them to tell their side of the story. They are not under any obligation to cross-examine their interview subjects, although they certainly have that option if they (and their subjects) so choose. The actual defamation did not start with CBS, however, which means they didn\u2019t create whatever unfair damage Fairfax claims. Fairfax would have to sue Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson for damages, but they don\u2019t have $400 million.\n\nSecond point: in order to win a defamation case under any circumstances, one has to have been defamed \u2014 accused of something that wasn\u2019t true. No one has proven these allegations either true or false to any degree of certainty. Fairfax\u2019s lawsuit has to be predicated on being able to prove both of the claims false. So far, all Fairfax has done is insist on his innocence, while his accusers insist on his guilt. This lawsuit would require Fairfax to prove his innocence by proving a negative, and to make the case that his innocence was so obvious that merely interviewing the accusers was malpractice. That first task is so Herculean that the American criminal justice system is designed to prevent defendants from having to do that very thing. For some reason, Fairfax has decided to take on the near-impossible \u2014 against a corporation with its own massive legal department.\n\nFurthermore, under Sullivan, Fairfax would have to prove actual malice on the part of CBS to win a defamation case. He\u2019s a public person, an elected official, which falls directly into the Supreme Court\u2019s intent for the higher burden of proof \u2014 to allow the media to report on allegations of wrongdoing by those in power. Even if Fairfax can somehow prove that the allegations are false \u2014 which he has yet to do publicly, other than his own denials \u2014 he\u2019d have to show that CBS knew at the time that (a) both allegations were false, and (b) they acted recklessly and outside their normal processes in airing the interviews. That\u2019s a high bar to clear even when media outlets publish provably false information, and it\u2019s far from clear that these allegations are provably false, or even false at all.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s beyond comprehension why Fairfax would do this now. The scandal had died down in Virginia (along with Ralph Northam\u2019s blackface scandal). Fairfax could have quietly gone back into private practice at some point and dealt with the Google searches as they came up. A splashy trial against CBS will dredge this all back up and then some as CBS\u2019 lawyers will dig further and further into Fairfax\u2019s background \u2014 and his accusers line up to tell their stories. And right now, they\u2019re pretty darned stoked to tell their stories under oath:\n\nAttorneys for one of the women accusing Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor of sexual assault say Justin Fairfax\u2019s defamation lawsuit against CBS over an interview she gave is a \u201cploy\u201d to preserve his political career. The attorneys for Vanessa Tyson say the college professor stands by statements she made during the CBS interview earlier this year. \u2026 Nancy Erika Smith is an attorney for Watson. Smith says, \u201cWe look forward to everyone testifying under oath, now that this matter is in court.\u201d\n\nCBS also says they plan to \u201cvigorously\u201d defend their actions in court, which seems not just reasonable but obvious. If this is a PR stunt by Fairfax, he might want to end it soon. This can end in a number of ways, but almost all of them are bad news for Fairfax.", "description": "Legal suicide.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fairfax.jpg"}
