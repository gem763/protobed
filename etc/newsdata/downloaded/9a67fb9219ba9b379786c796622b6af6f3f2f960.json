He also hit out at congresswoman Ilhan Omar in her home town, calling her a \"disgrace\" to the country.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Minneapolis police, who had said in a statement before the action that they wanted to facilitate both the rally and the peaceful protest, deployed officers on horseback and on bikes to disrupt the crowds and put out fires.\n\nOn the arrival of the police protestors could be seen jeering and hurling projectiles at officers, who in turn let loose pepper spray onto the crowd.\n\nA city with a strong heritage of political action and left wing support, Minneapolis has not seen a republican mayor since the early 1970s \u2013 with voters often opting for the Democrat aligned DFL party.\n\nThe state is also home to some of the president\u2019s most vocal critics \u2013 including Amy Klobuchar who is running for the 2020 Democratic nomination, and Ilhan Omar, who has been the subject of derision from Mr Trump and his supporters as one of a group of four congresswoman with strong left wing views referred to as \u2018The Squad\u2019.\n\nOriginally from Somalia, Ms Omar was repeatedly targeted by the president during his rally \u2013 calling her an \u201cAmerica hating socialist\u201d. He also took aim at her home country, pausing to allow his crowd to boo after mentioning its name.\n\n\u201cAs you know for many years leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impacts on schools and communities and taxpayers\u201d, he said, adding \u201cWe will always protect American families first\u201d.\n\nMinnesota is home to one of the largest concentrations of Somali Americans in the country, with many entering the country with the support of voluntary agencies contracted by the state department and making up around 1 per cent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nShortly after the rally, Ms Omar wrote on Twitter: \u201cTrump called me an \u2018America-hating socialist\u2019 and a \u2018disgrace\u2019\u201d He shouted xenophobic conspiracy theories about me. He scolded my district for voting for me. His hate is no match for our movement.\u201d", "description": "Trump flags and \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hats were set alight at protests outside the president\u2019s rally in Minneapolis last night as the president decried the democrats attempting to impeach him and focussed the rage of his audience on the Somalian migrants who have called the state home.", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/11/maga-hat-fire.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
