U.S. gold futures gained 0.8% to $1,516.20 per ounce.\n\n\u201cThe market is holding back, and looking at what\u2019s going to happen in the U.S.-China trade talks on Thursday... If the trade dispute turns worse, we are going to expect some strong risk-off trade,\u201d said Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu.\n\n\u201cThe players who were short, rolled back on their positions. We are also seeing some weakness on the equity side.\u201d\n\nThe United States on Tuesday imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities, angering Beijing ahead of high-level trade talks on Thursday and Friday, and sending Asian stocks lower.\n\nThe dollar was a shade lower against a basket of major currencies.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs on Chinese imports will rise on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened in Asia after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signalled further interest rate cuts and the resumption of bond purchases to address a recent spike in money market rates.\n\nLower interest rates generally reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold and weigh on the dollar.\n\n\u201cWith the latest QE-lite measures, we expect inflow of funds into gold-backed ETFs to continue, which is likely to push gold prices higher. We maintain that gold prices may test as high as $1,600/oz in this period of uncertainty,\u201d OCBC Bank said in a research note.\n\nSignals are mixed for spot gold, as it failed to break a support at $1,488 per ounce, said Reuters market analyst, Wang Tao.\n\n\u201cThe psychological $1,500 pivot looms as the first key support for gold, however expect to see interest extend as far as $1,485,\u201d MKS PAMP said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, silver gained 1.2% to $17.91 an ounce, while platinum rose 0.4% to $892.99. Palladium declined 0.2% to $1,673.17 an ounce.", "description": "Gold prices on Wednesday held on to the previous session's gains, as fading hopes for progress in U.S.-China trade talks hit risk appetite, while markets also awaited clues on monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438690371&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9800V", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
