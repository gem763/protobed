(The composer of Canada\u2019s national anthem performed in blackface.) Others, such as the society gossip columnist Shinan Govani, have acknowledged personal conflicts: \u201cIt is the season of moral gymnastics, here in Canada,\u201d he wrote in the Daily Beast.\n\nNeedless to say, dispassionate debate about the significance of Trudeau\u2019s costume\u2014parsing his intentions and the context\u2014is not possible, given that we\u2019re in the middle of an election. The picture went viral; that\u2019s what counts. Liberal Party candidates have been struggling. \u201cIt was wrong then, and it\u2019s wrong now,\u201d Harjit Sajjan, the defense minister, told the CBC. \u201cBut I\u2019m also here to talk about the person I know, in terms of how much he is standing up for people.\u201d\n\nWhatever Canadians may think about the photograph itself, it closes off a major line of attack for Trudeau. Live by the sword of political correctness, die by the sword of political correctness. You can\u2019t argue that your opponents are a bunch of embarrassing antiquities living in the political past\u2014by, say, replaying the Conservative leader\u2019s 2005 speech opposing gay marriage, which the Liberals were doing right up until this story broke\u2014when the internet is rife with your face in brown makeup.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Canada\u2019s surprising history of blackface\n\nThe Trudeau scandal points to a larger problem: The woke will always break your heart. It\u2019s not just that nobody\u2019s perfect, and it\u2019s not just that times change, and it\u2019s not even that the instinct to punish that defines so much of the left is inherently self-defeating. If people want to sell you morality, of any kind, they always have something to hide.\n\nThe main criticism from Trudeau\u2019s opponents on the right has usually been that he\u2019s a spoiled brat\u2014a son of privilege\u2014not up to running the country. A faker. The brownface debacle has now become, on the left, a symbol of his lack of real commitment to progressive values. But the cross-party consensus that Trudeau is slight and phony doesn\u2019t survive even a cursory examination of his record. An independent assessment by two dozen Canadian academics found that Trudeau has kept 92 percent of his campaign promises, the most by any Canadian government in 35 years. He is measurably, demonstrably the most sincere and effective prime minister in living memory. He is the rare case of a man whose virtue-signaling has distracted from his real virtues.\n\nOnly the left struggles with these standards of style. Right-wing political opponents in Canada and elsewhere have a completely different understanding of acceptable behavior. In the United States, President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters take his brand of nastiness, his aggressive rejection of even the most basic social norms, as a sign of authenticity. Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren is still apologizing for her Cherokee-ancestry claim.", "description": "Canadian progressives have to decide whether they care more about Justin Trudeau\u2019s policy achievements or his offensive style.", "authors": ["Stephen Marche"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19267680606846_bw-3/facebook.jpg?1570053198"}
