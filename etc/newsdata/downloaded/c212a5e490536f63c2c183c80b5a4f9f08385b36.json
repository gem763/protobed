Some of these reports also examined her failure to divest from Vulcan Materials Co. within her promised timeframe.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the Department intends to respond to your request but we found this matter egregious enough to raise with you directly,\u201d Jordan and Meadows wrote. \u201cThis is not the first time that you have used cherry-picked information to attack the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nThe Republican members said the investigation \u201crecycled allegations\u201c from news reports without including DOT\u2019s response. For example, they wrote, Cummings didn't acknowledge the agency's rebuttal that those reports merely wove together \u201ca web of innuendos and baseless inferences\u201c or note the fact that DOT\u2018s ethics official had said Chao\u2019s financial holdings did not present a conflict of interest.\n\nIn response to the Oversight investigation of Chao, DOT said last week that it \u201c[looks] forward to responding to the committee\u2019s request\u201c and said, \u201cMedia attacks targeting the secretary\u2019s family are stale and only attempt to undermine her long career of public service.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/78/c0/bbbab68e40b18452f6daa359928f/190926-elaine-chao-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
