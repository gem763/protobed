With roughly 38 days of campaigning under her belt in contrast to his comparatively light schedule of 70, she's on the road more than half as much as the two-term vice president, a Washington Examiner analysis shows. The arrangement compensates for the energy of not only younger rivals such as Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg, but also Bernie Sanders, who routinely holds more than four events a day while Biden sticks to one or two.\n\nHer initial appearances coincided with a national book tour promoting her 2019 memoir, Where the Light Enters, part of a deal the couple struck following eight years with former President Barack Obama's administration. It's common for candidates to launch a campaign with a book, much less so for a spouse to do so.\n\nAfter a messy controversy involving a college land deal, Jane Sanders is a quieter presence than in 2016. Chasten Buttigieg, 30, has a cult social media following and headlined the HRC Houston 21st Annual Gala in April, but usually remains in the shadow of his husband. Doug Emhoff, husband of California Sen. Kamala Harris, has hosted low-key solo engagements. Even their presence, however, is nowhere near the scale of Jill Biden's.\n\nBut Jill Biden, a divorcee who married then-Sen. Joe Biden, a widower, in 1977 is no ordinary political spouse.\n\nThe 2020 campaign marks their third White House race together, dating back to the Reagan years. Jill Biden was at her husband's side as he sought the 1988 Democratic nomination, which ended in failure amid revelations of plagiarism. Twenty years later, they relentlessly toured Iowa ahead of the January 2008 caucuses, but the veteran senator (he represented Delaware for 36 years) dropped out after a 0.9% showing that left him in fifth place.\n\nThis time, as a nationally-recognized figure, the former second lady is front and center. After a string of early mistakes at fundraisers, Jill Biden was used to steady the ship, introducing her husband to big donors and easing him into his address with a carefully-prepared speech of her own\n\nJoe Biden often introduces himself as his wife's other half \u2014 an endearing or, depending on one's view, cheesy, staple of old school pols. While she was in South Carolina, he was at a lavish fundraiser in the Hamptons, telling well-heeled donors: \"My name is Joe Biden and I\u2019m Jill Biden\u2019s husband.\"\n\nIn turn, she in turn was presented as his \u201csecret asset\u201d last month at a Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, fundraiser.\n\nAlthough she stirred controversy earlier in August by urging New Hampshire voters to \u201cswallow\u201d their concerns about the former vice president, she's defended him effectively him against allegations of inappropriately touching women and Harris' racially-charged accusations leveled during the opening debates. She's also provided a human face for his policies, evoking her younger sister Jan's stem cell transplant in a video to demonstrate the best of Obamacare.\n\nOn the trail, her steadiness counterbalances his regular verbal missteps. Her looks, as well as her bouncy demeanor, give the impression of much younger than a woman less than two years away from 70. She offsets her husband, whose wispy, snowy-white hair (boosted by hair plugs), slight frame, and weathered visage make him seem every one of his 76 years.\n\nHe speaks extemporaneously, sometimes ignoring his teleprompter and, to the chagrin of his long-suffering staff, the carefully drafted passages designed to keep him on message and out of trouble. His reputation for verbosity and rambling stretches back decades, though the frequency and nature of recent flubs has led some to suggest that they are age-related. In contrast, Jill Biden talks carefully and usually from notes.\n\nHer warmth was on display in the South Carolina recently. Jill Biden, whose Secret Service code name was Capri to the former vice president's Celtic, was greeted by 50 people in upstate South Carolina, which is reliably Republican.\n\nThe Northern Virginia Community College professor of English spoke about teaching, a career she continued part-time when Joe Biden became Obama's deputy in 2009 and now through his 2020 efforts. She was the first second lady to hold down a paying job while her husband served as vice president.\n\n\u201cI want you all to imagine it is summer 2021,\u201d she said. \u201cYou turn on the television \u2026 and when they cut to the president of the United States you don\u2019t turn the channel. You call your kids in from the other room.\u201d\n\nTravis Keller, 44, an assistant principal, and his son Cameron, 11, drove an hour so he could pepper Jill Biden with questions about the candidate's education plan. Her answers moved Keller, previously undecided, into Biden's camp.\n\nBeth Lee, 60, of Catawba, was already a Joe Biden fan \u2014 at least for one term \u2014 but the retiree\u2019s husband Alfred, 71, arrived at the event a Harris supporter. The ex-school teacher, however, left the War Memorial Building Saturday vowing to vote for the former vice president, citing Jill's \"imagine\" speech.\n\nJill Biden describes herself as a reluctant political spouse, but she's been one since 1972 when her first husband, Bill Stevenson, backed Joe's first Senate bid. She attended Joe Biden's victory party in November that year, though she says she met the newly-elected senator's wife Neilia, who was to die in a car crash with her baby Naomi the following month, but not the candidate himself.\n\nShe readily adapted to political life. During the 1988 campaign, she one-upped her fellow wives at a spouses forum by bringing Joe Biden, according to him, \"to carry her bags.\" In 2008 Biden attracted the ire of feminists when he said she was \"drop-dead gorgeous\" and quipped that her doctorate in educational leadership was \"a problem\" because it meant she spoke her mind.\n\nA favorite tale is how she advised her husband not to challenge former President George W. Bush in the 2004 election by storming into a meeting at their home wearing a two-piece bathing suit, so he could see the word \"no\" inked onto her stomach with a magic marker.\n\nAs second lady, she teamed up with Michelle Obama on initiatives to help military families and veterans.\n\nThe story of how Jill and Joe Biden met has varied, even in versions the former vice president has told. Some accounts have them meeting at his 1972 victory party. By the couple's telling, they first met in 1975 after he spotted her in an airport advertisement for Delaware parks, for which she had modeled. One Biden version is that the senator's brother Frank, who had known Jill at college, coincidentally set up a blind date. Other version suggest a more calculated arrangement.\n\nOn their marriage two years later, Jill became a second mother to the senator's young sons, Beau, then eight, and Hunter, then seven. Joe and Jill Biden had a daughter, Ashley, together in 1981.\n\nThe family has been touched by tragedy even after the agony of the deaths of Neilia and Naomi. Joe Biden had two near-fatal brain aneurysms in 1988, months after his first White House campaign collapsed. Then, when he was vice president, his son Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Behind the Hallmark card image of a perfect family that has overcome everything, however, Hunter has struggled with drug and alcohol addiction for decades and Ashley was also involved in drugs. In addition, Hunter had an affair with Beau's widow.\n\nIn South Carolina, Mike Katz, 67, an undecided Democrat, was initially irked that Jill Biden dedicated a portion of her 10-minute spot to her sister Jan's Obamacare story, wanting instead to hear specifics about Joe's policies. But sales representatives were impressed, calling her a \u201cReader\u2019s Digest version\u201d of her husband, more concise and better packaged.\n\n\u201cShe adds a softer touch,\u201d said Maxine Moses, 41, a Columbia paralegal. \"When she talked about her sister and affordable healthcare it just softens him a little bit because he's starch. He's straight up to me.\"\n\nAndrew Och, who has written a book about first ladies, said Jill Biden was invaluable. \"She makes him an everyday man accessible and removed from Washington, and her being younger and more polished than him doesn't hurt him either.\"\n\n\u2014 Emily Larsen contributed to this story.", "description": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 While Joe Biden fumbled repeatedly as he campaigned in New Hampshire recently, his wife Jill was almost 1,000 miles away in South Carolina, talking up the former vice president's 2020 White House bid in an altogether smoother manner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5ee247/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3844x2018+0+101/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F0e%2Fa8%2Fb8782aa743dbbb918082510df41a%2Fap-19219709694477.jpg"}
