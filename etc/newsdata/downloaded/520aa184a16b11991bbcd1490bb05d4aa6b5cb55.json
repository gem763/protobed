The space agency also plans to adjust the suit for use on Mars one day.\n\nThe suit is designed to withstand the extremes of life on the Moon, functioning through temperatures as low as -250\u00b0F and as high as 250\u00b0F.\n\n\"We want you to not have to think about the suit at all,\" NASA spacesuit engineer Lindsay Aitchison told Axios in July of the agency's plans for the xEMU. \"Anything you do just feels like working in your regular shirtsleeves.\"\n\nBut, but, but: The Artemis program still suffers from a lack of support in Congress, and the 2024 landing deadline is an ambitious one that will require billions of dollars in funding between now and then.\n\nGo deeper: NASA needs a new spacesuit", "description": "The new spacesuits are designed for more flexibility than Apollo-era suits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/YOQlWdp95KF-zhlS1UbQP9hy4yA=/169x185:1690x1041/1920x1080/2019/10/15/1571175116166.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
