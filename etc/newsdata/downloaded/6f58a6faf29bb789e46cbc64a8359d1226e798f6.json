But McCabe\u2019s lawyers and others tracking the issue are zeroing in on whether the Justice Department is employing a double standard to pursue him.\n\nThe doubts stem from Attorney General William Barr\u2019s notable public skepticism about potential obstruction of justice charges against President Donald Trump, especially after special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that there was insufficient evidence to make a case that Trump or anyone on his campaign illegally \u201cconspired or coordinated\u201d with Russia during the 2016 U.S. presidential race.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBarr and other Trump allies repeatedly suggested that the president couldn\u2019t be guilty of obstruction or that such a case would be exceedingly difficult to prove unless there was some underlying crime \u2014 like accepting illegal help from the Russians.\n\nYet federal prosecutors have been pressing forward with a false-statement case against McCabe even without any indication that the matters he is accused of lying about \u2014 whether he\u2019d authorized FBI personnel to talk to a Wall Street Journal reporter about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation \u2014 involved some illegality.\n\n\u201cDOJ simply does not bring criminal cases in these or similar circumstances,\u201d McCabe\u2019s legal team wrote in a recent memo arguing against his prosecution. \u201cAs Attorney General Barr noted in his March 24, 2019 letter analyzing whether the President had obstructed justice, the absence of evidence of an underlying crime is centrally relevant to whether a person had criminal intent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile some of the essential elements of obstruction of justice differ from the essential elements of false statements, the Attorney General\u2019s analysis is equally applicable here: the absence of an underlying crime, or even underlying misconduct, bears directly on whether an individual had the requisite criminal intent to make a false statement, and whether the government will be able to prove that a defendant had such criminal intent,\u201d the memo says.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/1549/1155968404_6004858800001_6004867557001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nA source close to McCabe\u2019s legal team told POLITICO that as McCabe\u2019s lawyers tried to head off his prosecution, they raised Barr\u2019s stance with respect to Trump both with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Washington and with officials from Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s staff. Those officials remained poker-faced in response to the argument, the source said.\n\n\u201cThere was no response. No sign of traction of any kind,\u201d the source said.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s legal team, headed up by former Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich, did eventually hear back from both the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and Rosen\u2019s office that the pleas were unsuccessful and that plans to charge McCabe were going forward.\n\nWhere those plans stand at the moment remains a bit murky after signs that the case was set to be presented to a grand jury for indictment last week. Officials won\u2019t comment on the status of the case. McCabe\u2019s attorneys say they\u2019ve inquired but gotten no updates.\n\nNevertheless, some legal experts say McCabe\u2019s lawyers\u2019 argument about Barr\u2019s earlier stance in the Trump-Russia probe has merit and deserves serious consideration by the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cMcCabe\u2019s attorneys are making an important argument that goes to the heart of prosecutorial discretion and the fact that consistency in decision-making by the Department of Justice needs to be questioned here,\u201d said Ellen Podgor, a law professor at Stetson University. \u201cProceeding with a case of just a \u2018shortcut offense\u2019 is contrary to statements made by Attorney General Barr with regard to the Mueller Report of needing an underlying crime for a prosecution. Is the government changing its tune depending on the individual under investigation?\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said the question was less one of legality than of consistency.\n\n\u201cBarr can justify this however he wants,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to prove an underlying crime to charge either perjury or false statements. Whether it\u2019s wise to charge it and whether I can get a conviction \u2026 without one is an entirely different question.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for Barr and for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on the claim of a double standard in the McCabe case.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s argument stems from several statements Barr made about the merits of a possible obstruction charge against Trump, most notably in the March letter concluding that the facts Mueller gathered did not amount to anything that could legitimately be used to charge the president with a crime \u2014 even assuming a sitting president could be charged.\n\n\u201cThe Special Counsel recognized that \u2018the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\u2019 and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President\u2019s intent with respect to obstruction,\u201d Barr wrote.\n\nOf course, the potential obstruction of justice issue with Trump and the false statement charges believed to be under consideration for McCabe are two different crimes. McCabe\u2019s memo acknowledges some distinctions, with obstruction focused on corrupt intent and false statements on a deliberate intent to deceive, although lawyers often lump such offenses together as \u201cobstructive\u201d acts.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s presentation to the Justice Department emphasized that, even setting aside Barr\u2019s observation, freestanding charges of false statements are uncommon and that in the few instances where they are brought in a contested case, prosecutors are often unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cThere is a consistent pattern of not proceeding criminally,\u201d the source close to McCabe said, noting numerous instances where FBI personnel allegedly lied to investigators but were not charged.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMcCabe was fired from the FBI in March 2018 after a Justice Department inspector general report found he showed a \u201clack of candor\u201d when he allegedly told the FBI\u2019s internal investigators and, later, the inspector general\u2019s team that he hadn\u2019t been involved in authorizing FBI lawyer Lisa Page and spokesman Mike Kortan to talk to The Wall Street Journal about the FBI\u2019s efforts to press forward with an investigation of the Clinton Foundation despite what some at the FBI viewed as resistance from the Justice Department.\n\nMcCabe denies that he lied, and contends that any misstatements on his part were the product of an innocent failure to recall, perhaps fueled by a slew of other matters he was dealing with at the time, including repeated attacks by Trump on FBI Director James Comey, the Mueller investigation and the FBI. McCabe is also suing over his firing , contending that the dismissal \u2014 on the eve of his becoming eligible for full retirement benefits \u2014 was a cave to political pressure from Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear precisely what motive prosecutors will contend McCabe had to lie, but it seems likely that if the case goes forward they\u2019ll suggest that he was trying to remain consistent with comments he\u2019d made to Comey as the two discussed trying to rein in leaks coming from other places in the bureau.\n\nThe inspector general report also suggests that McCabe might have misled others, since some of his acts seemed to serve his personal self-interest by pushing back in the media against suggestions he was carrying water for his wife, who had made an unsuccessful bid for political office in Virginia with the backing of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and a top ally of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nMcCabe has disputed almost all the inspector general\u2019s conclusions, but his legal team emphasizes that as deputy FBI director he had the authority to make disclosures to the media and, therefore, his involvement on that score did not amount to misconduct. They also contend that charges for false statements to investigators are \u201cvery, very rare\u201d without some prosecution claim of other criminal acts or official wrongdoing.\n\nOne such prosecution came a decade and a half ago against Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, Scooter Libby, in the investigation stemming from the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame\u2019s identity. Libby was hit with a five-count indictment alleging obstruction, false statements and perjury, but neither he nor anyone else was ever charged with the actual leak.\n\nAnnouncing Libby\u2019s indictment in 2005, special counsel Pat Fitzgerald famously defended the use of the false statement and obstruction laws even when decoupled from any other crime.\n\n\u201cWhat we have when someone charges obstruction of justice: The umpire gets sand thrown in his eyes. He\u2019s trying to figure what happened and somebody blocked their view,\u201d Fitzgerald told reporters at the Justice Department. \u201cThe truth is the engine of our judicial system. And if you compromise the truth, the whole process is lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf these facts are true, if we were to walk away from this and not charge obstruction of justice and perjury, we might as well just hand in our jobs,\u201d Fitzgerald added. \u201cBecause our jobs, the criminal justice system, is to make sure people tell us the truth. And when it\u2019s a high-level official and a very sensitive investigation, it is a very, very serious matter that no one should take lightly.\u201d\n\nA jury convicted Libby on four of the five charges against him. President George W. Bush commuted the 18-month prison sentence Libby faced. Trump pardoned Libby altogether last year.\n\nWhile some Republicans are now crusading for McCabe to be indicted, before Libby\u2019s indictment GOP lawmakers downplayed the significance of the expected charges, with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) saying she hoped that any case brought would not rest on \u201csome perjury technicality\u201d or \u201csomething that trips someone up.\u201d\n\nIn a curious wrinkle, Fitzgerald, the prosecutor in the Libby case, is now representing McCabe\u2019s former boss, Comey, who could be called as a prosecution witness at any trial for McCabe.\n\nIn 1997, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros was indicted by an independent counsel on 18 felony charges of obstruction, false statements and conspiracy for actions he allegedly took to cover up an extramarital affair that might have jeopardized his nomination for the Cabinet post. The case was widely derided as overkill and, on the eve of trial two years later, prosecutors settled for a guilty plea to a single misdemeanor charge of lying to the FBI.\n\nOne high-profile case that Barr\u2019s own Justice Department inherited from Mueller and is currently pushing toward a November trial is a seven-count indictment of the Trump confidant and GOP political consultant Roger Stone, consisting entirely of obstruction-type offenses such as lying to Congress or encouraging others to lie. While Mueller\u2019s team carefully examined Stone\u2019s dealings with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, there is no allegation that Stone did anything illegal in his actual dealings with the group.\n\nBarr\u2019s position is somewhat more nuanced than his critics have made it out to be. In a memo he wrote last year, before he was nominated as attorney general, Barr left the door open for witnesses \u2014 even presidents \u2014 to be charged for \u201csabotaging a proceeding\u2019s truth-finding function.\u201d\n\nAnd the attorney general never flatly ruled out obstruction charges unaccompanied by a more substantive crime. Asked about that issue at a Senate hearing in May, Barr said it was more common to bring such a charge with others because it\u2019s easier to get a conviction.\n\n\u201cUsually. But it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIt gets a little bit harder to prove and more speculative as to what those motives might be.\u201d\n\nSome of those involved with the probe into McCabe\u2019s conduct are acutely aware of the difficulties prosecutors can encounter in trying to prove a free-standing false-statement case. Two weeks ago, a federal jury in Washington deliberated for less than five hours before acquitting Greg Craig, President Barack Obama\u2019s first White House counsel, of a charge of scheming to deceive the Justice Department about his work on behalf of Ukraine.\n\nThe indictment in the case alleged that Craig broke the law by failing to register as a foreign agent, but he was never charged with that, potentially because of statute-of-limitations issues. At trial, prosecutors told the jury that he was guilty of lying and misleading regardless, but jurors did not buy it.\n\nOne of the prosecutors on that case, Molly Gaston, is now assigned to the McCabe investigation.\n\nFalse-statement charges are frequently used as the basis for a guilty plea in which prosecutors agree not to pursue a more significant charge that might be difficult to prove. Sometimes defendants actually prefer a false-statement charge because the punishment for such offenses tends to be minor, especially for first-time offenders.\n\nHowever, no deal seems to be forthcoming in McCabe\u2019s case. McCabe said in an interview on Tuesday that he would not agree to a plea bargain of any sort, even if it led to no jail time.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not \u2014 under no circumstances,\u201d McCabe told CNN, where he works as a paid contributor. \u201cI never intentionally misled anyone about anything, and I will not stand up and claim that I\u2019ve done something that I didn\u2019t do. So, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d", "description": "Lawyers for the former FBI deputy director are asking whether the Justice Department is using a double standard to pursue him.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6d/54/2f1ee9cc4f7da612a09ecd4441b4/190918-mccabe-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
