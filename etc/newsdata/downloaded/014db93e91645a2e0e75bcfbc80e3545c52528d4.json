Supporters viewed it as a basic first step to shape the tone of political discourse in the primary and guard against manipulation and online disinformation.\n\nBut party leaders did not bring the proposal to a vote at a meeting of the full DNC in San Francisco late last month, despite the pleas of the state chairs. Among the sprawling Democratic presidential field, only frontrunner Joe Biden has signed the pledge. The pact also calls on campaigns to publicly implore their supporters not to use disinformation and call them out if necessary.\n\n\u201cI haven't the faintest idea\u201d why it wasn\u2019t taken up, said Tina Podlodowski, chairwoman of Washington state\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cI'm kind of banging my head against this wall that has three letters \u2014 DNC \u2014 on it.\u201d\n\nThe DNC did not say whether it plans to adopt or implement the proposal crafted by the state party chairs. It was passed unanimously by the Association of State Democratic Committees in June ahead of the DNC\u2019s August meeting.\n\n\u201cIn our communications, we discourage the use of inauthentic content and actors,\u201d said DNC spokesman Daniel Wessel, referring to informal correspondence with state parties and campaigns. \u201cThose are tactics used against Americans, not ones Americans should use against each other. While we know this is a tactic that is not being used by our Democratic candidates, including our Democratic presidential candidates, unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Republican ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe debate over disinformation comes amid growing concern that both political parties are ill-prepared for proliferating disinformation schemes in the aftermath of Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 election. The DNC recently shut down \u201cvirtual\u201d caucuses in Iowa and Nevada \u2014 which would have allowed people to register their presidential preferences without spending hours at a caucus location \u2014 because of concerns they would be vulnerable to hacks. Multiple Democratic Party officials and cybersecurity experts said the decision should have been made months ago.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the campaign manager for presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke announced that a fake Twitter account had successfully spread a lie that the alleged shooter in Odessa, Texas' recent mass killing had an O\u2019Rourke sticker on his car. The DNC helped O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign identify that it was the victim of a disinformation campaign being spread by the fraudulent right-wing account.\n\n\u201cWe are so unprepared for the massive misinformation that is happening, that has happened and that will happen,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party. \u201cWe need our [DNC] leadership, including state party chairs, to get into a room create a policy for our candidates, campaigns, state parties and then hire a team to implement those policies.\u201d\n\nThough Kleeb said she\u2019s not too worried about Democrats using fake social media posts or hiring troll farms, she said the official party needs to have a codified policy.\n\n\u201cUnless it\u2019s written [down],\u201d she said, \u201cwe can\u2019t cut a candidate off from the voter file if they\u2019re breaking that policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Russians and other foreign state actors appear willing to use counterfeit measures to influence American elections. And the Republican Party has refused to officially disavow the deceptive campaign tactics, even after President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Guliani drew fire in May for retweeting a doctored video, known as a deep fake, making House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sound discombobulated.\n\nTrump has long dismissed the cyber and disinformation threat, even attempting to sow doubt about Russian interference in 2016. The president retweeted a spliced-up video about Pelosi earlier this year and has repeatedly retweeted accounts that appeared to be fake. One of Trump\u2019s reelection consultants published fake websites disguised as official platforms for Democratic candidates. And Trump\u2019s campaign used stock footage of overseas models from places like France and Brazil claiming to be Americans from states like Texas in social ads.", "description": "Pressure is mounting on the national party to adopt an official stand on the use of deceptive tactics.", "authors": ["Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez", "Natasha Korecki"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HInYKfaGvUuQOvM3mdImhA--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/275c91411080b04e2fda0fd903f6c163", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
