IOF officials investigated the results after protests from rivals including Russia, Switzerland, France, Poland and Austria, and a jury decided to void the Chinese team\u2019s results and ban them from other races. Organisers rejected an appeal from the Chinese athletes.\n\nIt is an embarrassing episode for China, which was hosting the sporting event for the first time. China built an athlete\u2019s village for the 10-day event in Wuhan, and the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, attended the opening ceremony.\n\nObservers saw the event, which is held every four years for military athletes from around the world, as part of an effort to build closer ties between the People\u2019s Liberation Army and other armies and bolster the Chinese military\u2019s profile.\n\nNews of the disqualification was not widely reported in Chinese media on Thursday, in contrast to reports this week celebrating the team\u2019s wins.", "description": "Athletes lose moral compass after using secret paths and markings to win contest", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd1a3eaac13c14159b36c4140e4b5f9481594800/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8dd369c247828ace1a096a89db572d0", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
