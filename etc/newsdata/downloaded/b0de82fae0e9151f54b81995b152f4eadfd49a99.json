The first, in August, occurred when a pro-communist fanatic attempted to beat him in broad daylight with a baseball bat.\n\nSham is the convener of the Hong Kong Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), a pro-democracy organization that has taken a leading role in ensuring the legality of the ongoing protests in the city. CHRF members regularly file the legal paperwork to receive a letter of no objection, or a permit, for peaceful protests. Without the letter of no objection, Hong Kong residents do not have the right to freely assemble.\n\nThe CHRF has also been at the forefront of advocating for the rights of protesters who have been beaten, imprisoned, and allegedly abused by Hong Kong police officers.\n\nIn addition to his work with the CHRF, Sham is running for a representative spot on the Sha Tin District Council in upcoming elections.\n\n\u201cThe Civil Human Rights Front strongly condemns the acts of the perpetrators,\u201d the group said in response to the attack on Sham on Wednesday. \u201cIt is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights.\u201d\n\nGruesome photos began to surface on social media Wednesday of Sham lying in a pool of his own blood in front of a car in the Tai Kok Tsui neighborhood, where he was on the way to a CHRF meeting about a protest organized for this weekend.\n\nApple Daily, an anti-communist newspaper, published a photo of Sham lying bloodied on the ground, confirming its authenticity.\n\nJimmy Sham was taken to Yaumatei's Kwong Wah Hospital on Wednesday evening, a short distance from the scene of the attack in Mong Kok.

The Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) said that the thugs number at about four to five people and attacked Sham with hammers. Quoting another CHRF member, Figo Chan, the outlet noted that Sham never lost consciousness.\n\nChan told reporters that Sham repeatedly the protest slogan \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d while being placed in an ambulance. The protesters have made five demands of their government: the withdrawal of a bill granting China full extradition power, freedom for political prisoners, direct election of lawmakers, an independent investigation into police brutality, and an end to calling peaceful protests \u201criots.\u201d The slogan refers to the fact that Chief Executive Carrie Lam promised Hong Kong that the Legislative Council would withdraw the extradition bill, then demanded the protesters cease their activities.\n\nThe South China Morning Post alleged that the unidentified assailants, who are still at large, were \u201cnon-ethnic Chinese,\u201d despite the fact that they were reportedly covering their faces.\n\nPolice officials claimed that they did not have any leads on the identity of the assailants, who were reportedly wearing black, the preferred color of the Hong Kong protest movement. Protesters online have begun to circulate videos showing police treating the crime scene carelessly, highlighting the fact that one officer appears to step into a puddle of Sham\u2019s blood.\n\n\u201cHong Kong police stepping on bloodstains at the scene of an attack against democrats,\u201d Agnes Chow, an activist with the pro-freedom group Demosisto, wrote in Japanese online. \u201cThe criminals will probably not be caught again, or only a couple of people will be arrested instead of everyone. It is always like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cPro-democracy people and demonstrators are immediately arrested, and those who attack [them] are not caught and have no legal responsibility. Is Hong Kong a society of law?\u201d she asked. \u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d\n\nSham dictated a message written on his Facebook page to supporters confirming that he was in stable condition and would continue to fight against pro-China forces.\n\n\u201cI have stitches and my wounds are taken care of!\u201d he said, adding that many protesters \u201chave suffered more than me\u201d in advocating for liberty from the repressive Chinese Communist Party. \u201cI am sorry to make everyone worry. I will recover as soon as possible, then continue to stick to the goals of the five demands.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the police for arriving quickly and urged \u201ccalm\u201d in the face of the attack.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party in Beijing has not openly deployed officers to oppress the democracy movement, but mobs of armed thugs have appeared at the sites of protests on multiple occasions to physically attack protesters. In one particularly violent instance, a pro-China mob armed with metal sticks cornered peaceful protesters in an underground metro station in July, beating them severely as many were trapped on trains. Police arrested a small number of the estimated 100 men that showed up to attack the protesters \u2013 who, at the time, were on their way home and had concluded their assembly \u2013 and confirmed that they had ties to the organized crime groups known as triads.\u201d\n\nSham escaped harm in a similar street attack in July, in which unidentified individuals attempted to beat him with a baseball bat. At the time, he was with a friend who endured the worst of the attack and was hospitalized for bruising.\n\n\u201cThis vile attack against Jimmy Sham appears to be a deliberate attempt to target a well-known pro-democracy activist. On top of terrifying physical threats Jimmy Sham also faced homophobic abuse,\u201d Man-kei Tam, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said shortly after the baseball bat attack.", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Jimmy Sham is in the hospital late Wednesday after an unknown group of thugs bludgeoned him with hammers.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1150150549-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
