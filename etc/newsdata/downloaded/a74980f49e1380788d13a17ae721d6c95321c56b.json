(Redskins 7, Dolphins 0, 6:13 Second Quarter)\n\nAD\n\nQuinton Dunbar intercepts Josh Rosen: Landon Collins, who nearly had an interception earlier in the drive, forced a fumble by tight end Nick O\u2019Leary on a fourth-down reception that O\u2019Leary recovered inches past the first-down line to gain. Redskins Coach Bill Callahan challenged the ruling on the field of a completed pass, which stood after a review. Two plays later, Redskins cornerback Quinton Dunbar made his third interception of the season by jumping a slant route. (Redskins 7, Dolphins 0, 7:47 Second Quarter)\n\nAD\n\nTerry McLaurin touchdown gives Redskins the lead: After running 10 plays for 25 yards without picking up a first down in the first quarter, the Redskins\u2019 offense finally got moving. Adrian Peterson had five carries for 60 yards on Washington\u2019s fourth drive, which culminated in a 25-yard touchdown pass from Case Keenum to Terry McLaurin. The rookie wide receiver now has four touchdowns this season. (Redskins 7, Dolphins 0, 11:34 Second Quarter)\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nPenalty stalls Dolphins\u2019 third drive: On fourth-and-three from the Redskins\u2019 45-yard line, Miami left its offense on the field and called a direct snap to running back Kalen Ballage, who picked up eight yards along the right side. A questionable offensive pass interference penalty on a completion to Albert Wilson that would\u2019ve resulted in another first down derailed the Dolphins\u2019 drive and led to the sixth punt of the first quarter. (Redskins 0, Dolphins 0, 0:14 First Quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis game might end in a 0-0 tie: Make that three possessions, three three-and-outs for the Redskins after Case Keenum couldn\u2019t connect with Trey Quinn on third-and-7. Keenum is 3 for 5 for 16 yards. His counterpart, Josh Rosen, is 2 for 4 for 8 yards. The teams have combined for 13 yards on 17 plays. (Redskins 0, Dolphins 0, 6:11 First Quarter)\n\nJosh Rosen has no protection: The Dolphins\u2019 quarterback has faced pressure on almost every snap thus far. After being sacked by Landon Collins for a loss of nine yards on the first play of Miami\u2019s second possession, an incompletion and three-yard pass to Mark Walton led to another Dolphins punt. (Redskins 0, Dolphins 0, 7:40 First Quarter)\n\nDolphins make another stop: This wasn\u2019t the start the Washington offense was hoping for against the NFL\u2019s worst defense, which is allowing 41 points per game. The Redskins went to the air on their second possession, with Case Keenum sandwiching a couple of incompletions around an eight-yard hookup with Kelvin Harmon. (Redskins 0, Dolphins 0, 9:09 First Quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWashington\u2019s defense records two early sacks: An unnecessary roughness penalty on Jon Bostic gave the Dolphins a first down on their first possession, but the Redskins\u2019 defense responded with sacks by Matt Ioannidis and Jonathan Allen on the next series to force a Miami punt. (Redskins 0, Dolphins 0, 10:12 First Quarter)\n\nRedskins go three-and-out on opening possession: The Dolphins won the coin toss and elected to defer, giving the Redskins the ball first. Washington wasted no time trying to establish the run, with Case Keenum handing off to Adrian Peterson on first and second down. The veteran running back totaled five yards on his first two carries before Chris Thompson was stopped one-yard short of the line to gain on a third-down reception, leading to a Tress Way punt.

The Bill Callahan era begins in Washington with a trip to Miami, where the 0-5 Redskins will take on the 0-4 Dolphins in a woeful matchup that rates as the worst in more than a decade, according to ESPN\u2019s Football Power Index metric.\n\nCallahan, who replaced the fired Jay Gruden on an interim basis, said he intends to establish the run more than his predecessor, which was welcome news for Adrian Peterson. The veteran running back has rushed for only 108 yards through five weeks, but could finally break out against a Dolphins run defense that ranks as the worst in the league.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Dolphins, who remain the favorites to land the No. 1 pick in next year\u2019s NFL draft, have been outscored by an average of 34 points per game. Their anemic, 31st-ranked offense is led by quarterback Josh Rosen, who has one touchdown and three interceptions, and running back Kenyan Drake, who has rushed for only five more yards than Peterson.\n\nPregame reading\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdrian Peterson is re-energized by Bill Callahan\u2019s run-first plan. \u201cI\u2019m hyped about it,\u201d Peterson said of Callahan\u2019s commitment to establishing the run. \u201cYou look at the first four weeks \u2026 totally opposite from what we did last year when we were able to be more successful as a team.\u201d (Read more)\n\nBruce Allen defends Redskins tenure, says the \u2018culture is actually damn good.\u2019 At a news conference in the wake of Gruden\u2019s firing, the Redskins\u2019 team president suggested, once again, that Washington is close to achieving success.
