Frese has previously re-tweeted several of Macias's stories about national security issues\n\nDescriptions of tweets included in the court documents match those sent out by Macias and Kube last year.\n\nMacias authored or co-authored with Kube a number of articles during the timeframes cited in the court filings that reference U.S. intelligence reports and weapons systems of foreign nations such as China and Russia.\n\nNeither reporter was accused of any wrongdoing. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. An NBC spokesman declined to comment.\n\nAccording to court documents, Frese and Macias lived at the same address in Alexandria, Virginia, from August 2017 through August 2018.\n\nAuthorities say that based on their social media accounts, they appeared to have been romantically involved for some or all of that period of time.\n\nAccording to court documents, Frese accessed an intelligence report unrelated to his job duties on multiple occasions in mid-April to early May last year.\n\nA week after he accessed the report for the second time, he allegedly received a Twitter direct message from Macias asking if he would be willing to speak to another journalist, Kube.\n\nHe said he was 'down' to help if it helped Macias because he wanted to see her 'progress', according to the court filings.\n\nHe spoke to both journalists on April 27, 2018 soon after he looked at the intelligence report again.\n\nThe NBC reporter involved made headlines separately on Wednesday before Frese's arrest was made public. Footage emerged of Kube's young son interrupting her live cross about the ongoing conflict in Syria\n\nMacias then published an online article about 30 minutes after they spoke that contained classified national defense information, the court filings state.\n\nWhen Macias tweeted a link to her story, Frese later re-tweeted the article, according to the court documents. Frese has previously re-tweeted several of Macias's stories about national security issues.\n\nOn September 11 this year, the FBI intercepted a phone called between Frese and Macias discussing Kube and her assignments at work.\n\nFrese then allegedly spoke to Kube after accessing further intelligence reports on September 24.\n\nHe is accused of giving that reporter classified information. At that point, Frese's phone was being tracked on court-authorized surveillance.\n\nAuthorities said the disclosure of the classified materials could have caused serious harm to U.S. national security.\n\nThis marks the sixth federal case involving leaks of classified information in a little over two years. A crackdown on leakers was initiated by the Trump administration in 2017 and led by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.", "description": "Henry Kyle Frese, 30, was arrested Wednesday over charges he leaked the information\u00a0about a foreign country's weapons system to two journalists.
