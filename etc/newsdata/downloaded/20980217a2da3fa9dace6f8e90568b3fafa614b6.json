In 2007, there were 6.8 suicides per 100,000 people among ages 10 to 24, while in 2017 there were 10.6 suicides, according to the CDC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuicide is the second leading cause of death among people in that age range, behind accidents, according to The Washington Post. The suicide rate was higher than the homicide rate in that age group starting in 2011.\n\nWhen broken down by age groups, the suicide rate for those aged 10 to 14 almost tripled between 2007 and 2017. For teenagers 15 to 19, the rate surged 76 percent in that decade.\n\nFor 20- to 24-year-olds, the rate of suicides has been increasing from 2000 to 2017, at a rate of 36 percent.\n\nThe Post noted researchers do not know the reason for the spike in the suicide rate among teens and young people, though they saw it as cause for alarm.\n\n\u201cJust looking at these numbers, it\u2019s hard not to find them completely disturbing. It should be a call to action,\u201d Lisa Horowitz, a pediatric psychologist at the National Institute of Mental Health, told the Post.", "description": "The suicide rate among those between ages 10 to 24 jumped between 2007 and 2017, according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cdc_logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
