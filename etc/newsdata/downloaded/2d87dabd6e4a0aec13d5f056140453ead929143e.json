CCTV footage shows the pooch getting abandoned in the night\n\nWendy Dowse, 54, manager of Parklands Care Home, told how a member of staff found the adorable dog tied up outside at 7am and brought him in for some food and water.\n\nAt first they believed the dog may have been lost and left at the home by a commuter heading to the nearby Metro station, but changed their minds after watching the CCTV footage.\n\nMs Dowse said: 'We posted about what had happened on Facebook to see if anybody owned the dog. We took him to the vet to see if he was chipped, but he wasn't registered.\n\n'We then checked CCTV and saw a young lad walk up the home and tie him up at 5am in the morning.\n\n'You could just see the dog looking at him, it was devastating.'\n\nWendy said they contacted the vets again and told them the dog had been left deliberately, at which point they contacted the RSPCA.\n\nAt first care home staff believed the dog may have been lost and left at the home by a commuter heading to the nearby Metro station, but changed their minds after watching the CCTV footage (pictured, top right the dog is walked towards the gate)\n\nShe added: 'He was lovely but you could tell he frightened and shaken.\n\n'We are all animal lovers here. The RSPCA have kept us up to date because we were all so concerned.\n\n'Hopefully he gets a happy ending - a home with somebody who loves him.'\n\nInspector Cathy Maddison, from the RSPCA, has since launched an investigation, and should the man responsible be found he could face up to six months in jail.\n\nShe said: 'It was dark when he was abandoned but you can see a tall man with his hood up with Panda before he's abandoned.\n\n'Panda was taken to the vet where staff found he was microchipped but his chip wasn't registered.'\n\nThe RSPCA has now launched an investigation and is hoping to track down the person responsible for abandoning Panda (pictured)\n\nIt is a legal requirement in England to have your dog microchipped and your details registered with a microchipping company.\n\nThis is so that if your dog goes missing you can be quickly reunited.\n\nMs Maddison suspects Panda's owner has abandoned him when they could no longer look after him.\n\n'Unfortunately we respond to thousands of calls every year where an animal has been abandoned because their owner simply can't take care of them anymore,' she said.\n\n'Pets are a huge commitment and responsibility, and they can be expensive, so we find many dogs, cats, horses and other pets are abandoned every year.'\n\nThe RSPCA has now launched an investigation and is hoping to track down the person responsible for abandoning Panda.\n\n'We've called him Panda due to his pretty black and white markings,' she said. 'He's in fairly good condition and was wearing a smart, new red collar.\n\n'Panda is a lovely boy but he's obviously really confused and is absolutely terrified. It's so sad.'\n\nHe will be put up for adoption if an owner does now come forward. Panda was microchipped in 2016 and vet staff believe he's around three years old.\n\nAnyone with information is urged to contact the RSPCA's appeal line on 0300 123 8018 and leave Ms Maddison a message.", "description": "CCTV shows a man\u00a0abandoning the Staffie cross - now nicknamed Panda - outside a care home in Seaham at 5.10am on Thursday, October 10.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/20078342-0-image-a-72_1571826657172.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
