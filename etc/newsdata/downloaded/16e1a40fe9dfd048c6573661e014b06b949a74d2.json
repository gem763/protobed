And the scandal is beginning to reveal the opaque agendas of a pair of Ukrainian oligarchs whose legal troubles have led them to seek favors in Washington.\n\nDiGenova and Toensing, who played major roles in the Bill Clinton dramas of the 1990s and resurfaced amid Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, have signed up to represent Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian gas magnate who currently resides in Vienna pending extradition to the U.S. to face bribery charges.\n\nLast year, the married lawyers were briefly expected to formally join Trump\u2019s legal team to defend him in the special counsel\u2019s investigation, but those plans were quickly scrapped due to conflicts of interest with their existing clients. The couple resurfaced, however, working in conjunction with efforts by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nFor Firtash \u2014 who is fighting extradition from Austria to the U.S. to face bribery charges \u2014 his involvement began at least as early as July, when he parted ways with Lanny Davis, the lawyer who guided Bill Clinton through a variety of investigations and now represents Michael Cohen, the former Trump fixer who confessed to tax evasion, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, among other crimes.\n\nDiGenova and Toensing have signed up to represent Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian gas magnate facing bribery charges.\n\nFirtash replaced Davis with Toensing and diGenova, a colorful and aggressive couple with a nose for scandal and skill at pushing a narrative through allies like John Solomon, the conservative columnist at the Hill who has been writing frequently about Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine and about Marie Yovanovitch, the veteran ambassador who was abruptly recalled in May amid attacks on her from Trump allies. DiGenova has gone on Fox News to attack Yovanovitch by name, claiming she had been privately telling others that the president was likely going to be impeached.\n\nThe couple also appeared in a packet of materials the State Department inspector general delivered to Congress on Wednesday, which Democrats described as unsubstantiated smears against Yovanovitch. The packet included a printout of an email Solomon sent to diGenova and Toensing, with a link to a column he wrote about Yovanovitch. The documents had been \"distributed at the highest levels of the State Department,\" according to Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).\n\nDespite their hard partisan leanings, the couple are fixtures of a sort in Washington\u2019s unique social scene. Last year, diGenova was invited to participate as a \u201cringer\u201d in the exclusive Gridiron Club\u2019s annual dinner, where he sang and played in various skits poking fun at the Trump administration, including one routine in which he played a lovelorn Kim Jong Un exchanging tender letters with the president.\n\nToensing, meanwhile, has been promoting Trump\u2019s preferred narrative on television and social media. The New York Times reported in May that she had met with Yuriy Lutsenko, Viktor Shokin\u2019s replacement as prosecutor general, and was planning to travel to Ukraine with Giuliani, though the trip was reportedly scrapped.\n\nLike his predecessor, Lutsenko, who left his post in August, has been accused of corruption by Ukrainian reformers and Western officials. While still in his post, Lutsenko closed investigations into Burisma and its founder but then told Solomon in April that he possessed information related to the energy company that would be of interest to the Department of Justice. In an interview published on Sunday, he told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens \u201caccording to Ukrainian law,\u201d and that any investigation would be \u201cthe jurisdiction of the U.S.\u201d He also told the L.A. Times he'd seen no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nIt became clear that Toensing and diGenova\u2019s PR efforts had intersected with their work for Firtash last week when an affidavit emerged that was signed by Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor general fired in 2016 at Joe Biden\u2019s urging, and submitted on Firtash\u2019s behalf to an Austrian court. At the time, it was the position of Western governments and institutions like the International Monetary Fund that Shokin should be removed, and by all accounts Biden was just representing the official U.S. position.\n\nRecently, Shokin has been claiming that Biden pressured Ukraine\u2019s government to fire him because the then-vice president\u2019s son Hunter sat on the board of a natural gas company that Shokin\u2019s office had been investigating \u2014 the same narrative that Toensing and diGenova have been pushing, but which the Biden camp adamantly denies.\n\nIn 2013, the Justice Department accused Firtash of bribing Indian officials as part of a racketeering scheme aimed at gaining approval for a titanium mining project in that country. Firtash is an \u201cupper-echelon\u201d associate of Russian organized crime, according to a 2017 Justice Department court filing. He told a U.S. ambassador of his consultations with the notorious Russian mob boss Semion Mogilevich, according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable, though Firtash has denied it.\n\nFirtash is an \u201cupper-echelon\u201d associate of Russian organized crime, according to a 2017 Justice Department court filing.\n\nShokin\u2019s new affidavit claims that Biden improperly pressured the government of Ukraine to prevent Firtash from entering Ukraine \u2014 from which he could not be legally extradited \u2014 and links those claims to his previous allegations about the motivations behind Biden\u2019s role in his firing. Biden\u2019s representatives have said his son\u2019s board position played no role in his official actions and pointed out that Western leaders had long wanted Shokin fired over his reluctance to pursue corruption investigations, including those targeting Burisma and its owner.\n\nBut Shokin\u2019s move to speak up on behalf of Firtash has further undermined his credibility in the eyes of observers in the U.S. and Ukraine, who already viewed his campaign against Biden as the vendetta of a corrupt bureaucrat.\n\nAs the founder of RosUkrEnergo, Firtash acted as a middleman between the Russian and Ukrainian national natural gas companies, and allegedly played a central role in a corrupt scheme to use the profits from reselling cheap Russian gas to fund pro-Russia political forces in Ukraine.\n\nFirtash worked with Paul Manafort on an abortive effort in 2008 to redevelop a New York hotel for $895 million. Firtash also reportedly played a role in Manafort\u2019s 2005 hiring as a consultant to the Party of Regions, the pro-Russian political party of which Firtash was a major backer.\n\nJohn Herbst, who served as ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush, said the association with Firtash undermines the entire effort by Trump allies to push for investigations of the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian election interference. \"The Giuliani team does not understand Ukraine. If it did, members of his team would not be representing Dmytro Firtash, perhaps the most odious oligarch in Ukraine,\u201d said Herbst, now director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council. \u201cShokin\u2019s defense of Firtash underscores that he was never and is not today a fighter against corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s preposterous,\u201d said Adrian Karatnycky, a Ukraine expert and former president of the pro-democracy NGO Freedom House, of the story laid out in the affidavit. Pointing to Firtash\u2019s Kremlin ties, he said, \"There is now a distinct possibility of a Russian hand in all this.\u201d\n\nDiGenova said he was in meetings in Vienna \u2014 where his client Firtash is awaiting extradition \u2014 and did not respond to questions.\n\n\"There is now a distinct possibility of a Russian hand in all this\" \u2014 Ukraine expert Adrian Karatnycky\n\nAnd Firtash isn\u2019t the only Ukrainian oligarch with big legal problems who now faces questions from investigators: On Monday, the House Oversight Committee demanded documents and communications related to influential billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky as part of its subpoena of Giuliani.\n\nThe involvement of Kolomoisky and Firtash complicates the already mind-boggling array of factions and agendas that form the backdrop of the Ukraine scandal. Because both face potential criminal liability in the U.S., both have reason to align themselves with Trump and try to ingratiate themselves to the president\u2019s allies, according to Ukraine experts.\n\nBut the exact nature of Kolomoisky\u2019s role in this saga isn\u2019t yet clear. The billionaire owns the television network, 1+1, on which actor Volodymr Zelensky starred in a television show that catapulted him to political prominence. Kolomoisky \u2014 embroiled in a bitter feud with Zelensky\u2019s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko \u2014 also became Zelensky\u2019s biggest backer in his successful bid to unseat Poroshenko and claim the presidency this spring.\n\nKolomoisky allegedly stole billions of dollars from his bank, PrivatBank, before it was nationalized by Ukraine in 2016, according to a lawsuit filed in Delaware by the bank\u2019s new leadership. How much influence he will yield in Zelensky\u2019s government is one of the biggest questions hanging over the new president\u2019s administration.\n\nAnother important question is what Kolomoisky might be seeking from Trump.\n\nThis spring, two Florida-based, Soviet-born businessmen who are aiding Giuliani\u2019s effort traveled to Israel, where Kolomoisky has been holed up while he faces legal jeopardy in the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\nKolomoisky told the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a consortium of investigative journalists, that the businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, approached him about a natural gas venture, but they instead used the meeting to seek an audience for Giuliani with Zelensky. Kolomoisky said he refused the request, while Giuliani has claimed that Kolomoisky defamed Parnas and Fruman.\n\nBut there is more to Kolomoisky\u2019s role in this saga beyond an apparently unpleasant meeting. Kolomoisky, who is known for his bravado, has been claiming to have damaging information on the Bidens, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nKolomoisky, who is known for his bravado, has been claiming to have damaging information on the Bidens.\n\n\"He's been floating that out for quite a while, to keep himself relevant to the whole discussion, and he would also like to ingratiate himself to Trump,\" said Ken McCallion, an attorney who brought a federal suit that was later dismissed against Firtash over the alleged natural gas scheme on behalf of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. \"He's been kind of cryptic and cute about it,\u201d said McCallion, who remains in close touch with contacts in Ukraine. McCallion indicated Kolomoisky was claiming to have information about both Bidens, \u201cthe father and the son.\"\n\nAnother person familiar with Kolomoisky\u2019s claims said the oligarch was claiming to possess valuable information in order to gain leverage in an FBI investigation of him underway in Ohio that is reportedly focused on possible financial crimes.\n\nA lawyer for Kolomoisky, Mike Sullivan at Ashcroft Law Firm, did not respond to requests for comment. In May, Kolomoisky told the Kyiv Post that he has committed no crime and that any federal probe will \u201cresult in nothing, as usual.\u201d\n\nWhile Kolomoisky\u2019s connection to the saga counts as a twist, for close Ukraine watchers, it hardly comes as a surprise. \"Kolomoisky is a person who gets involved in every issue,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \u201cHe loves fighting, and he has an extraordinary capability to get into the details and be effective in the worst fashion.\"", "description": "A pair of GOP operatives who played major roles in Lewinsky-era political intrigue are back.", "authors": ["Ben Schreckinger", "Quint Forgey", "Bryan Bender", "Wesley Morgan"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1151770606-1200x628.jpg"}
