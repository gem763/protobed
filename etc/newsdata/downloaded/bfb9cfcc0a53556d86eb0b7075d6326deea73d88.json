That\u2019s as a Federal Reserve decision looms for later.\n\nThe Fed is pegged to cut rates 25 basis points. Investors will be listening up for future policy hints and its thoughts on oil prices and maybe on this scarcity of cash issue. As for the latter, investment firm Blackstone\u2019s vice chairman Tony James, is among those trying to calm the waters.\n\n\u201cThe rate spike looks very scary, but it\u2019s only overnight. The actual cost to the system is not high, it\u2019s more of a concern for dealers,\u201d James told Bloomberg TV. The Fed is planning another operation to inject cash into the system Wednesday after a $75 billion operation on Tuesday.\n\nRead: DoubleLine\u2019s Gundlach says Fed took baby step toward QE with repo operation\n\nOnto our call of the day from Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, who warns investors are sleepwalking when it comes to one area of the global economy.\n\n\u201cI think that there may be a bit too much complacency about inflation and interest rates staying low,\u201d Sonders tells MarketWatch in an interview. \u201cI\u2019ve always had the view that we should be as least as intrigued by the story no one\u2019s telling as by the story everyone is telling.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has a mandate to keep prices stable, which right now isn\u2019t a problem, but should it become one, interest rate hikes come back into the spotlight. Financial markets and investors have grown pretty comfortable with the idea of central banks stimulating economies rather than slowing them down.\n\n\u201cEven if we\u2019re not going headline into 1970s runaway inflation, hyperinflation, stagflation, I just think consensus became so convinced inflation here and globally was dead and buried forever, that even a slight adjustment in that trajectory and the implications that would have for monetary policy is something that\u2019s not being digested well enough,\u201d says Sonders.\n\nShe also worries about a global manufacturing recession, a trade war and the fact markets can get jolted by a single tweet \u2014 as we\u2019ve seen when President Trump fires off some zingers. Sonders says a neutral position on global stocks \u2014 where Schwab has been for about two years \u2014 may be the safest place for investors.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a treacherous environment right now to make a huge bet in either direction, either on the extreme optimistic side or on the pessimistic side because we\u2019re in this stage right now where the needle can go either way. The best advice we can give in this environment of uncertainty is stay at your normal allocation, but use the swings to rebalance,\u201d says Sonders.\n\nOpinion: Stock market\u2019s eerie parallels to September 2007 should raise recession fears\n\nThe market\n\nThe pre-Fed struggle for direction is real. Dow YM00, -0.13% , S&P ES00, -0.15% and Nasdaq NQ00, -0.18% are edging south, and oil CLV19, -1.63% is down again. Gold GCZ19, -0.11% is off and the dollar DXY, +0.11% is up.\n\nEurope stocks SXXP, +0.05% are slightly higher, while Asia markets ADOW, -0.46% went nowhere ahead of the Fed decision.\n\nThe economy\n\nHousing starts \u2014 the number of new homes on which construction has begun \u2014 came in much stronger than expected, with building permits also climbing. The Fed announcement is due later and a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell.
