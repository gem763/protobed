A new study suggests it might do more harm than good, leading to \u201cneuroticism\u201d and causing employees even more stress.\n\nI know, I know, you\u2019re thinking \u201cwhat does this clown know about work hours and proper jobs?\u201d Admittedly, I have never had a \u201cproper\u201d job. I have temped in a few offices, but the positions were always even more temporary than planned. After graduation I worked at a Prontaprint shop in Winchester (my university town). The job was \u201cupdating the client database\u201d on a giant computer. This was the mid-Nineties, and I didn\u2019t know what a database was or how to turn a computer on. I had no clue what I was doing and sat there tapping uselessly for several hours. On day three I chirped, \u201dI\u2019m just popping to the loo\u201d and I went out of the back door, down the alleyway and never went back.\n\nI moved back to London and got another office job. After half an hour of trying to work out how to use a coffee machine to make the boss a drink, I was asked to fax a document. They might as well have asked me to make an origami gorilla. I stood by the fax machine for a while with the document in my hand. I pressed a few buttons, started crying, then left and got a job as a cleaner. I know where I am with a mop.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI found the office environment as intimidating as I do the gym. Everyone seemed to know what they are doing and how to work things, while I wandered around feeling baffled and fat. Also, there are people there who have the authority to tell you off. I am not good at being told off by people who are not my mother. I\u2019d rather be booed off stage by drunk people who hate me (Belfast, 2001, if you\u2019re asking) than have someone in a scratchy suit telling me my targets \u201care a little bit disappointing this week aren\u2019t they?\u201d (telephone sales, 1992, fluorescent light tubes).\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world 1/14 Marley Dias @iammarleydias At just 11 years old, Marley Dias gained international attention in 2016 after becoming frustrated with the lack of diversity in her school curriculum. What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. Witton is inspirationally confident and isn\u2019t afraid of talking about her sex life to her thousands of subscribers in videos such as 'How Many People Have I Slept With?' and 'The Benefits of Porn'. The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma. Getty 8/14 Adwoa Aboah @adwoaaboah British model Adwoa Aboah is no stranger to the crippling effect of depression having suffered from it herself. This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers. AFP 12/14 Rowan Blanchard @rowanblanchard When Rowan Blanchard isn\u2019t taking over the world of acting, she\u2019s taking to Twitter and Instagram to talk to her 5.1 million followers about various activist pursuits. The 17-year-old uses her platform to discuss social and economic issues, with topics as diverse as human rights and gun control, and isn\u2019t afraid to give a voice to those who haven\u2019t been heard. Blanchard was very vocal in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas shootings earlier this year, talking with activists and highlighting their plight on social media. Getty 13/14 Liv Little @livlittle As the founder of Gal-dem, a magazine produced by women of colour, Liv Little has gained international recognition for her work in diversifying print media.

What I sell is not always tangible, but it\u2019s a business nonetheless and I\u2019m its chief executive officer and so have mountains of emails to deal with every day.\n\nI have an agent, of course, who will bat away the ones she knows I don\u2019t have to deal with. But there is still a regular \u201cping ping ping\u201d on my phone, people electronically tapping me on the shoulder wanting a word.\n\nWeekends are when I have the time and head space to answer these emails. During the week I write when the kids are at school, sort out dinner, then rush to a gig somewhere. Lazy weekend mornings are often my time to scroll through and reply to less urgent messages. I never, ever expect an email back at weekends, but I imagine that if people don\u2019t want to be disturbed they will turn off notifications.\n\nThe \u201cright to disconnect\u201d is well meaning but frankly it\u2019s not just work emails that glue us to our phones. So many of us constantly check and recheck social media. It\u2019s all a part of a modern malaise. I suppose it would be a bit much if Lidl and Volkswagen confiscated employers phones on a Friday at clock out time.\n\nWhat if they and other businesses instead instigated a cultural shift so if we don\u2019t respond to an email straight away, or choose to do it on a Sunday morning, we are not regarded as unprofessional. We need to stop treating electronic email as we did phone calls in the Eighties. Back then, no matter what you were doing \u2013 you could be fast asleep, in the bath, up a ladder \u2013 when the phone rang, answering it would be your absolute priority because it \u201cmight be important\u201d. And if you missed a phone call, it wouldn\u2019t be there half an hour later, or sit waiting until the next day. Emails are; they can wait for a time which suits.\n\nSo many of us need the flexibility to work after hours or at the weekend. This is not the Forties; emails are not telegrams telling us we are going to war.\n\nRecently, I got the most superb automatic reply from a hugely successful writer I was corresponding with. It told the sender to be patient as he\u2019s off writing, offering a few emergency numbers. At the end was written: \u201cApologies, but this is the only way I\u2019m actually going to be a writer and not an emailer who writes as a hobby.\u201d\n\nPerfect. If we could all could make automatic responses as honest as this, then people could pick and choose when to send their emails and know where they stand with whoever is their recipient.", "description": "Bosses at Lidl and Volkswagen are trialling a ban on all work emails at weekends and between 6pm and 7am.
