Did you do anything to prevent those deportations?\u201d Ramos asked Biden.\n\nHe then pointed out that the former vice president has refused to answer similar questions in past debates. \u201cSo let me try once again: Are you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations? Why should Latinos trust you?\u201d\n\nDuring Obama and Biden\u2019s two terms, the U.S. government deported a record number of immigrants, causing some immigrants rights advocates to label Obama the \u201cdeporter-in-chief.\u201d Obama later shifted his policies, and his deportation figures dropped.\n\nBiden responded that comparing Obama to Trump was \u201coutrageous,\u201d adding that \u201cwe didn\u2019t lock people in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected some undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to have served with him,\u201d Biden continued, later abruptly changing the subject to the Violence Against Women Act, which he is credited with having spearheaded.\n\nBut Ramos didn\u2019t let Biden off the hook, insisting: \u201cYeah, but you didn\u2019t answer the question: Did you make a mistake with those deportations?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\u201d Biden responded.\n\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d Ramos shot back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States,\u201d Biden simply said.\n\nModerator Jorge Ramos grills Biden about the 3 million deportations that took place during the Obama administration: \"Did you make a mistake with those deportations?\"\n\n\n\nBiden: \"The president did the best thing that was able to be done.\"#DemDebate pic.twitter.com/akkk71xxFe \u2014 HP LatinoVoices (@LatinoVoices) September 13, 2019\n\nRamos then turned his pointed line of questioning to Castro, who also served in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cYour party controlled the White House and Congress in 2009 and didn\u2019t pass immigration reform,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cSo why should voters trust Democrats now?\u201d\n\nCastro then echoed Biden in arguing that Obama was \u201cvery different\u201d from Trump, saying the current president has \u201ca dark heart when it comes to immigrants\u201d and built his political career \u201cscapegoating\u201d them.\n\n\u201cBut my problem with Vice President Biden is \u2026 every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says \u2019Oh, I was there \u2026 every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president,\u2019\u201d Castro said.\n\n(Biden later responded: \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years \u2015 good, bad and indifferent.\u201d)\n\nCastro noted that he was the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan in April and added that he would not be willing to give up DACA or other protections for immigrants to pass a compromise bill with Republicans on immigration.\n\n\u201cI believe in January 2021, we\u2019re gonna have a Democratic president \u2026 a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House, and we\u2019re gonna pass immigration reform within the first 100 days,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the start of the debate, Ramos had powerfully kicked off the night by welcoming the Latinx community and speaking in Spanish: \u201cEn este pa\u00eds, tambi\u00e9n se habla espa\u00f1ol,\u201d he said \u2015 or: \u201cIn this country, we also speak Spanish.\u201d\n\nHe then mentioned that this is a hard time for Latinos in Texas and beyond after the mass shooting in El Paso last month. The shooter had posted a racist, anti-immigrant manifesto railing against a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d of the state.\n\n\u201cEsto tambi\u00e9n es nuestro pa\u00eds,\u201d Ramos said: \u201cWe are Americans, too.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nUnivision\u2019s Jorge Ramos Temporarily Detained In Venezuela During Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Interview\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro Hammers 2020 Candidates Over Criminalization Of Immigrants\n\nJoe Biden Refuses To Say Whether He Agreed With Obama's Deportations\n\nLove HuffPost?
