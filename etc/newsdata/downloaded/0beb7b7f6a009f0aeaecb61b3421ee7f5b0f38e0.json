And Mr. Erdogan agreed to the cease-fire only after he effectively achieved everything he wanted, driving the Kurds far back from the Turkish border in a brief but murderous onslaught.\n\nAnd only a day before Mr. Trump lifted sanctions on Turkey, Mr. Erdogan had spent several hours in Sochi, Russia, with a happy Mr. Putin \u2014 another of Mr. Trump\u2019s paragons of effective governance \u2014 getting his marching orders from the Russian leader. With the Americans now out of the way and the Kurds in flight, Turkey and Russia will now jointly patrol the border area.\n\nThat Mr. Putin and Mr. al-Assad were now undisputed masters of Syria seemed not to faze Mr. Trump. Nor did he appear concerned that Turkey, a NATO ally whose country harbors American nuclear weapons, and whose leader recently let on that he is thinking of getting nukes of his own, was looking to buy state-of-the-art weaponry from NATO\u2019s primary foe. \u201cOther countries have stepped forward. They want to help, and we think that\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Trump said, making clear that he meant not the European allies \u2014 who, as usual, got a passing whack from the back of the president\u2019s hand \u2014 but rather Russian forces, recently accused in a Times investigative report of systematically bombing Syrian hospitals.\n\nPerhaps it should not come as a surprise anymore that Mr. Trump sees anything he does as a great and unprecedented achievement, or that he views the Middle East as little more than a patch of \u201cbloodstained sand\u201d that Americans should stay out of, or that he puts more stock in dictators than in allies.\n\nYet it still comes as a shock that a man, already facing an impeachment inquiry over his misuse of the presidency to pressure Ukraine into doing his political dirty work, would not pause to wonder whether there might be a better way to conduct the foreign policy of the world\u2019s most powerful \u2014 and once most respected \u2014 nation. In shaping his view on Ukraine, too, Mr. Trump apparently paid more heed to autocratic Ukraine-bashers like Mr. Putin and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary than to any of his own advisers.", "description": "It\u2019s certainly special for Erdogan, Putin and al-Assad.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/opinion/24putinWeb/24putinWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
