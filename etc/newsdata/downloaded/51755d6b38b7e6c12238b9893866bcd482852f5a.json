Some girls at the lunch table next to his (who didn\u2019t even participate in college colours day) had made fun of his sign that he had attached to his shirt. He was DEVASTATED.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to make the student feel better, Snyder wrote that she planned to buy him an official University of Tennessee t-shirt, and asked if any of her Facebook friends had connections at the school to \u201cmake it a little extra special for him\u201d.\n\nThe incident, which went viral after it was shared more than 8,000 times, caught the attention of the university, which responded by sending the student and his class a care package of University of Tennessee merchandise and apparel, including hats, notebooks, football helmets, and cups.\n\nThe university also decided to sell replicas of the boy\u2019s handmade t-shirt on its campus store online - with proceeds going to anti-bullying organisation Stomp Out Bullying. Shortly after launching a pre-sale of the shirts, the school's website crashed due to \"the overwhelming support\".\n\n\u201cNow you can share in this student\u2019s Volunteer pride by wearing his design on your shirt too,\u201d the website reads.\n\nAccording to Snyder, when she told her student that his design was being made into a real UT t-shirt, his \u201cjaw dropped\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe had a big smile on his face, walked taller and I could tell his confidence grew,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe fourth-grader's artwork also made it onto UT's campus, where it is emblazoned on an orange boulder.", "description": "The University of Tennessee is featuring an elementary school student\u2019s design on official merchandise after the fourth grader was bullied over his homemade UT t-shirt.\u00a0 For College Colours Day at Altamonte Elementary School in Altamonte Springs, Florida, students were asked to dress in the clothing\u00a0of their favourite universities.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/20/screen-shot-2019-09-09-at-3.19.16-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
