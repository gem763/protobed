The vehicles were later found, and more than 20 people were charged in connection to the thefts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thefts forced car2go to suspend its service in Chicago for a week as the company worked to institute an \u201cenhanced, multi-layered verification process,\u201d according to the report.\n\nCar2go said that the incident was unrelated to its decision to leave Chicago, saying that was a unique situation of fraud.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, Chicago is a complex market \u2014 due to its growth and infrastructure \u2014 and requires a significant investment on the part of any mobility provider wanting to enter the city,\u201d a car2go spokesperson told FOX Business. \u201cWhile we still believe that Chicago is well-suited for free-floating carshare, we underestimated what was necessary for our business to grow in this market at this time.\u201d\n\nCar2go will continue offering its service in New York, Seattle, Washington, Montreal and Vancouver, Canada. The company said it would refocus its efforts and resources on those cities \u201cthat present the clearest path to free-floating carshare success.\u201d\n\nThe service launched in North America in 2009. In its statement, car2go said transportation \u201chas changed drastically\u201d since then.\n\n\u201cThe transportation market is highly volatile, especially in North America,\u201d car2go said. \u201cWe are certainly not the only transportation player \u2014 from traditional automakers to ride-hail giants to micro-mobility disruptors \u2014 who have had to face this reality and adjust course. Ultimately, we know that in order to ensure the future of our business in North America, we have to think differently about where and how we operate.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "More than 100 of car2go's luxury vehicles were stolen in Chicago last spring.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/White-CLA-Dinner.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
