We have a very serious situation as we have a very big hurricane moving by to our north,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the storm\u2019s eye was located to the west of the archipelago, which lies about 650 miles (1,046 km) east of the United States.\n\nThe storm packed 120 mph (193 kph) winds and was moving at 16 mph (26 kph). It was a category three hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, the NHC said.\n\nFlights have been cancelled from Bermuda\u2019s main airport and some residents covered windows with wooden planks and metal sheeting in Hamilton, the capital.\n\nNational Disaster Coordinator Steve Cosham warned that the storm could topple trees and tear down power lines, while tornadoes could damage buildings.\n\nResident Saivo Goater placed boards across the sliding glass doors of his two-story dwelling, remembering back-to-back hurricanes in 2014 that ripped off parts of his roof.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through that again,\u201d Goater said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\u201d\n\nOfficials ended government ferry services and will close a major road leading to the airport at 6 p.m. local time.
