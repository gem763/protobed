I don't find fat attractive.'\n\nAdmitting to Victoria she doesn't find fat bodies attractive - her own included - Babs gives examples of other positive qualities she sees in her fellow housemates instead.\n\nBabs (pictured right with Courtney) is forced to apologise to Courtney after telling Victoria she doesn't find her attractive, but likes her personality\n\n'Each one of you is attractive in your own way,' she explains. 'You know Courtney, I don't find her size attractive but she has a beautiful personality and has a lovely way about her.'\n\nAfter the emotional conversation, Victoria takes Courtney, 26, from Lincolnshire, who is a self-love advocate aside, to share Babs' controversial comments about her.\n\nShe interprets Babs' comments about her to mean she thinks she has a lovely personality but ugly looks - leaving her upset.\n\n'I don't know if I should feel hurt or not that she looks at my body like that,' says Courtney.\n\nSpeaking to the cameras, Babs explains: 'It's been quite an emotional day with frictions between me and Victoria and Courtney. \"Do I find fat people attractive?\" I can't lie...I told the truth and the answer's \"no\".'\n\nAnd after she apologises to Courtney for the remarks, Courtney admits: 'I do get what you mean and where you're coming from, I felt like that.'\n\n'I felt like I couldn't see any kind of beauty in any of this. It was disgusting to me, I do get it.'", "description": "Babs, 50, from Sussex, is forced to apologise to fellow housemate Courtney, 27, from Lincolnshire in tonight's episode of BBC Two's\u00a0Who Are You Calling Fat?.", "authors": ["Latoya Gayle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20344116-0-image-a-33_1572380669669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
