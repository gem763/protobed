We never thought about it the Champions League final in Kiev. It happened, we wanted to have more of it after the Kiev experience.\n\n(Image: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)\n\n\"We knew before last season that we were one of the few teams, six, seven, eight or nine maybe, in the Champions League that could win it. We showed that the year before, and we thought we should try it.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t suffer during the season because of the Champions League final and I don\u2019t think Tottenham is like this. You just carry on.\"\n\nRumours of squad unrest and uncertainty behind the scenes have dogged Tottenham's start to the campaign.\n\nThey have suffered losses to Newcastle , Leicester and Brighton ; as well as Carabao Cup elimination to Colchester, and a 7-2 drubbing at the hands of Bayern Munich.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut Klopp feels there is no way to determine what the issues are at the club from the outside, and is taking their 5-0 win over Red Star Belgrade in midweek at face value.\n\n\"I can\u2019t say anything about Tottenham. You have to be in the situation to understand it, and I am not in Tottenham\u2019s situation.\n\n\"What I saw on Tuesday was a very good Tottenham side. That\u2019s what we are thinking about, not about why the start has not been as you or Tottenham expected.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSpurs have provided tricky opposition for Liverpool in recent times, with a late Mohamed Salah goal proving the only difference in this fixture last season.\n\nAnd following the Champions League final win in June, Klopp feels Tottenham have a point to prove at Anfield.\n\n\"We should not be surprised [at their start],\" he added. \"From time to time, things don\u2019t work out. That\u2019s football.\n\n\"We saw in that midweek game, and even in the other games they had good moments. They didn\u2019t forget how to play football. Harry Kane, Son, Alli, they didn\u2019t forget.\n\n\"The Eriksen situation, all that stuff, you cannot finally understand it from outside, but they are always able to put a proper performance in and that is what we have to expect.\n\n\"And on top we won the Champions League final. We were very respectful that night with all the celebrations, but we were still the ones on the other side of that night and of course that is another additional motivation.\n\n\"It\u2019s a football game between two good football teams.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know how many points they have but they are a top side and will be for the whole season. We have to respect that and play the best football we can play.", "description": "Spurs have struggled for results this season following their route to the European cup final against Liverpool in June", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Tottenham Hotspur Fc Via Getty I", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724152.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Liverpool-UEFA-Champions-League-Final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
