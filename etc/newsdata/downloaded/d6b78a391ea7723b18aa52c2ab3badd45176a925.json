People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.\"\n\nToday one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.\n\nKeen to capitalise on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism - the Palata Srbija government building, which is currently only open once a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBUILDING A DREAM\n\nAfter World War Two socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948.\n\nResidential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country.\n\nThe architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds - Western democracy and the communist East, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.\n\nBut after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.\n\n\"Now enough time has past (since Yugoslavia fell apart) and people have begun to appreciate the architecture of Yugoslavia,\" said Alan Braun, lecturer at Zagreb University's architecture faculty.\n\nHe said the style was unique because of its visible influence from the West, reflecting Yugoslavia's unique position.\n\nResidential areas were planned to have enough parks, cinemas, swimming pools and even parking space.\n\nThe Palata Srbija building hosted former world leaders such as U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Russian leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev.\n\nEach of the former Yugoslav republics had its own salon with a central room called the hall of Yugoslavia. Furniture and carpets were custom made and some of the most prominent artists produced paintings and mosaics.\n\nThe outside of the building is concrete, but the inside is marble. Its centrepiece is a crystal chandelier beneath a 19 metre dome weighing more than nine tonnes.\n\n\"It is a shame to keep such a master piece away from the eyes of the public,\" said Sandra Vesic Tesla, curator of the building.\n\nOther examples of Yugoslav brutalism include the huge memorials commemorating the struggle against fascism by Tito's partisans, often placed in dramatic rural settings.\n\nMany of those pieces of art remain in disrepair, such as the monument to the uprising against fascism in Petrova Gora in Croatia. However, the Tjentiste memorial, commemorating the killing of 7,000 people by the Nazis was renovated last year.\n\nMiodrag Zivkovic, the 91-year-old sculptor of the 19 metre-high concrete Tjentiste memorial was among the first artists in the former Yugoslavia to use concrete.\n\n\"It is stable material, resembling stone but it is easier to work with,\" he said.\n\n\"For every project back in those days there was a national contest, and artists from all over the country had the opportunity to apply, and that competition produced quality.\" (Writing by Ivana Sekularac, Editing by Alexandra Hudson)", "description": "Genex Tower is unmissable on the highway from Belgrade airport to the centre of the city.
