Throughout the summer I\u2019d be going on them pretty much every week.\n\n\"I\u2019d usually do a few sessions throughout the week and then have one on the day I was going out, just to get the glow.\n\n\u201cI felt better with a tan, so even before I\u2019d go on holiday, I\u2019d use the sunbed a few times to get a base tan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go to a high street sunbed salon, or I\u2019d go to friends houses if they had one at home, and I\u2019d always have the maximum time \u2013 usually nine minutes, but sometimes 12.\n\n\u201cMost recently I went to a local salon and it was 90 minutes for \u00a312 so it was obviously cheaper than a spray tan. At the time I thought it was incredibly cheap, but now I realise it was basically just a cut-price way to get skin cancer.\u201d\n\nLisa, who lives in Tynemouth just outside Newcastle, says she first used sunbeds in the late 90s and noughties.\n\n\u201cNobody worried about it then. Even when there were stories of people getting skin cancer, I always thought it wouldn\u2019t be me,\" she said.\n\n\u201cFamily would say to me \u2018Lisa, you\u2019re not a normal colour, you\u2019re far too dark\u2019 but to me it was a case of the darker the better. That\u2019s how I felt. What I didn\u2019t think about was that the darker I was, the more damage I was doing to my skin.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d say \u2018Lisa, you\u2019ll end up getting cancer\u2019 but that\u2019s when I\u2019d joke about looking good at my funeral, I just never took it seriously.\u201d\n\nLisa finally began listening to the warnings around three years ago, when she stopped using sunbeds and started taking more care of her skin safety.\n\nThen in September last year she noticed two raised freckles on her chest which were a slightly different colour to the rest.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey weren\u2019t typical of the skin cancer photos you see, where they\u2019re dark and patchy, they were just a bit redder and sore all the time.\n\n\"When I dried myself after a shower I couldn\u2019t rub my chest dry, I had to pat it, because they were so tender.\u201d\n\nAlthough she told her GP she\u2019d been a prolific sunbed user, she was given steroid cream for psoriasis.\n\nThat didn\u2019t make any difference, so after a house move at Christmas, she asked her new doctor for a second opinion.\n\nLisa said: \u201cOne of my doctors works at the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary in the skin unit so I saw her and as soon as she looked at the freckles she said, \u2018I think you\u2019ve got skin cancer\u2019.\n\n\"She told me not to be alarmed, but it\u2019s hard not to be when you hear the C-word.\u201d\n\nFour punch biopsies on freckles, leaving holes in her chest to be stitched, revealed Bowen\u2019s Disease and actinic keratosis \u2013 an early non melanoma skin cancer and sun damage.\n\nLisa was treated at Newcastle RVI in August, and has just finished a four-week course of chemotherapy cream, Efudix.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was warned by my consultant how horrendous it would be, that my skin would get incredibly sore because it attacks the cancerous cells and scorches the skin.\n\n\"But I\u2019m one of the lucky ones because I was just applying it to a few areas, whereas some people have to use it on their whole face which is far worse.\n\n\u201cWhat I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the hair loss. I was in the shower one day and ran my hand through my hair and it just started coming out in clumps.\n\n\"When I spoke to the pharmacist she said it was the nature of the chemo drug, and there is a risk of it being absorbed into the blood stream.\u201d\n\nAs the cream continues to work, Lisa will have to go back for a check-up in November but she says she\u2019s now far more vigilant about her skin.\n\nShe added: \u201cI know I have to keep a close check on myself and be careful in the sun. I\u2019m about to go away on holiday and it will be the first one where I\u2019ve not spent a week lying in the sun from sun up to sun down.\n\n\"That was the kind of holiday I loved, soaking up the sun by the beach, but not anymore.\u201d\n\nLisa says she wishes she could turn back the clock to 1998 and never start using sunbeds.\n\n\u201cThen the worry of the last few months could have been avoided,\" she said.\n\n\"Bowen\u2019s Disease can take decades to appear so I don\u2019t know exactly what the lasting damage will be for me, but now I\u2019m older and wiser and would do anything to stop someone else going through this.\u201d", "description": "Lisa McConnell has shared horrendous pictures of chest wounds and hair loss as a warning to others about sunbed obsession", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Copy Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532888.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Lisa-McConnell-with-partner-Chris-1jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
