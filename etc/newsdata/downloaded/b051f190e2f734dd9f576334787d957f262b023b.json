This June, she wrote an installment about a concert I\u2019d also been at, for a popular indie dad rock band that she loves, and that I love, too. She mocked them a little, saying things like \u201cTheir whole onstage persona is that of a man eternally one drink away from starting every sentence with my wife.\u201d And that the lead singer seems \u201ccaught up in his sexuality like a sea lion tangled in a microphone cord.\u201d\n\nThis is not an essay you can imagine being received the same way on a mainstream music blog, especially one read by men who worship indie rockers, or people who don\u2019t already know Fitzgerald\u2019s style. And as she goes on, she pulls out the personal part, which is that these weird and funny bits of psychoanalysis of strange older men is part of her own sexual history with \u201cdads\u201d and people who radiate, as she calls it, \u201cbig divorce energy.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s kidding, but it\u2019s serious; the arguments are playful and then they\u2019re meticulous; it\u2019s a several-thousand-word piece of cultural criticism, but it\u2019s also just an email. The ambivalence of the format is what makes it special, and the privacy is what makes that possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually documented and verified if you go back to the earliest things being written about TinyLetter, [that] it was mostly women writing them or creating them,\u201d Shane says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s just convenient to ignore it and act like this is something that a few enterprising men and Silicon Valley guys realized, cut out this period where women were popularizing it and using it in very particular ways, and be like, Oh yeah, look at this thing we found.\u201d\n\nBut intimacy and weirdness and specificity don\u2019t tend to be compatible with making money, at least not at Silicon Valley scale. Double Bounce, the weird-internet inspired TinyLetter spin-off developed by my friend Claire\u2019s brother, allowed writers to charge subscription fees but kept the same underground feel. There was no discovery section; you could only subscribe to new newsletters if someone sent you their URL directly. (\u201cYou get people who come in and have 12 people sign up and the 12 people never unsubscribe and they read every single thing\u2026 We all don\u2019t need to be internet megastars, in fact I think we\u2019d all be better if we weren\u2019t all trying to be internet megastars,\u201d Alex Carusillo said shortly after he launched the site.) Writers could also charge whatever fees they wanted, and most chose fairly low ones.\n\nThe platform was out of business within a year, and Substack, started by acquaintances of Alex Carusillo\u2019s, arrived shortly after.\n\nBuzzFeed News journalist Anne Helen Petersen writes another of the more popular newsletters on Substack, and calls herself an early convert. \u201cTinyLetter is a piece of shit and you can quote me on that. [Mailchimp has] consciously decided they\u2019re going to let it die on the vine,\u201d she speculates. (Contacted for this story, a Mailchimp spokesperson said \u201cThere are no immediate plans to sunset TinyLetter, but Mailchimp plans to integrate it into the main Mailchimp platform in the future.\u201d)", "description": "Venture capital has finally come for the least sexy communication style.", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/shutterstock_1083175808/facebook.jpg?1570472175", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
