So, too, did the Brits who voted convincingly to leave the EU, especially after the government pledged it would honour the result.\n\nIt didn\u2019t quite work out that way.\n\nThe rules in a representative democracy are that after an election the winners govern for a set period. In the direct democracy of a referendum, the majority decision should be enacted.\n\nIn both cases, the losers have to accept the result and allow the transfer of power to take place.\n\nAnd that brings us to 2016, when the Democrats couldn\u2019t get over losing to President Trump and the British \u201cRemain\u201d establishment began blocking Brexit.\n\nIn spite of alleged efforts to prevent it, Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, whereas the Brexit verdict is still stuck in the jobs-to-do list. Or is that the never-to-be-done list?\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s agenda has certainly been hampered by the barrage of impeachment calls and endless accusations of racism and treason. What has been alleged as a full-blown coup attempt by the deep state, would have stopped it altogether.\n\nIt is only because of his fortitude, his loyal \u201cDeplorables\u201d and probably being smarter than his opponents, that is he still living on Pennsylvania Avenue, with four more years likely coming his way.\n\nSadly, the Brexit referendum, which was won by 17.4 million \u201cLeave\u201d voters in the biggest turnout in British voting history, has so far yielded nothing. Well, almost nothing.\n\nThat is because the driving force behind Brexit, Nigel Farage, was a Westminster outsider. Although he brilliantly outmaneuvered Prime Minister David Cameron and forced him to allow a people\u2019s referendum, Mr. Farage had no power to get it through Parliament.\n\nThe Conservatives sought to marginalize him by taking over the Brexit mantle, but this proved disastrous as most of them didn\u2019t believe in it and they put a \u201cRemainer,\u201d Mrs. May, in charge.\n\nYet, even in its state of non-being, Brexit has caused a seismic change in British politics.\n\nThe MPs\u2019 loyalties within the two biggest parties can no longer be relied upon, the Liberal Democrats have been rejuvenated by standing as the main \u201cRemainer\u201d party, and Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit Party has soared as the defenders of the 2016 referendum result.\n\nThe dominance of the Conservative and Labor parties may have been diminished by the debate over \u201cLeave\u201d and \u201cRemain,\u201d yet, the philosophical division over rule by the people or the state is still there.\n\nNot that the left-of-center parties in the U.K., or the Democratic National Committee in the United States, would ever admit to not believing in democracy \u2014 even to themselves.\n\nBut, by continually trying to bring down the Trump presidency, Democrats daily seek to thwart the democratic will of the American people. Their primary legislative goal seems to have been to stop the Trump presidency lasting four years, let alone four more.\n\nLikewise, their British soul mates have been busy blocking Brexit. Nothing exemplifies this more perfectly than the outrageous, official slogan adopted by the \u201cRemain-again\u201d Liberal Democrat Party of \u201cBollocks to Brexit.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a phrase that polite folks would never utter, yet their popularity has increased. Some anti-Brexit Conservative and Labor MPs have even joined them.\n\nThat vulgar wording not only shows contempt for the outcome of the referendum, but also for the 17.4 million who voted for Brexit, and for democracy itself with the Lib-Dems advocating to nullify the referendum result.\n\nAs for bad language, the left thrives on it. What passes for humor seems to be how many times comics can use the F-word in the same sentence as Brexit or Mr. Trump.\n\nJokes are used to show political allegiance, while belittling and intimidating their enemies. Jo Brand, an English comedienne, was defended by the BBC after broadcasting that she fantasizes about throwing car battery acid over Nigel Farage. No \u201chate crime\u201d there apparently, just \u201cpushing the boundaries.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to stand up for polices that the angry left disapproves of, so agreeing with them is always the safer path to follow. Who wants to be vilified in the way that Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage have been?\n\nI once interviewed Margaret Thatcher and she said, \u201cIt has never been easy to get the voice of conservatism heard.\u201d Her successors tried the easier path of consensus and compromise, but none of them enjoyed anywhere near the kind of majorities that she commanded. Is there a lesson there?\n\nIn the future, it seems Democracy itself will need such a staunch defender.\n\n\u2022 Andrew Davies is a U.K.-based video producer and scriptwriter.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
