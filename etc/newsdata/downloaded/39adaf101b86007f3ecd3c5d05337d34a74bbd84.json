Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d By this morning, however, he\u2019d deleted the tweet and posted an apology \u2014 as Chinese companies pulled sponsorship over the message and Morey\u2019s employers reportedly considered firing him.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s controversy wasn\u2019t unique \u2014 journalist Max Read listed companies that had apologized over slights like omitting Taiwan from a map of China on a t-shirt. But it was a microcosm of how companies struggle to deal with China\u2019s influence. And while this case involved one man posting a personal opinion online, it\u2019s particularly pertinent for companies that let millions of people post opinions and find facts online.\n\nApple reportedly limited Taiwan\u2019s flag in its emoji library\n\nAmerican tech companies have had to deal with Chinese government censorship and surveillance rules for years. Google initially brought Search to China by purging results about touchy topics like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, until ending the practice by pulling out of China in 2010. Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn agreed to censor anti-government material in order to stay online, while Facebook and Twitter have been largely banned since 2009, when they helped citizens spread news about deadly riots in Xinjiang.\n\nFar more recently, Apple removed pro-democracy songs by Hong Kong singers from its Chinese music store. And despite using its commitment to privacy as a selling point, it moved some iCloud data to Chinese servers in order to comply with local laws \u2014 raising concerns about whether this might have a chilling effect on what data people feel safe storing. Just last week, Apple reportedly removed Taiwan\u2019s flag from its iOS emoji library in Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nThese are sweeping, consequential decisions about speech \u2014 and even when companies object, it\u2019s hard for them to stay away from the massive Chinese market. Google has slowly reentered the China with file management and translation apps, and it started building a search engine that could track users and censor certain topics before stopping amid internal protests. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt apparently disagreed with the decision to leave in the first place \u2014 he wanted Google to \u201cstay in China and help change China to be more open.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear the web is opening up China\n\nAs Vox writes, though, it\u2019s unclear that the web is opening up China; in fact, China might be making the web itself less open. Tech companies sometimes tout their refusal to cooperate as a moral victory \u2014 Google did so in 2010, and Facebook recently boasted that it would \u201chold firm\u201d on not storing data in authoritarian countries. But as we\u2019ve seen with Google, that\u2019s a hard position to maintain. Meanwhile, ByteDance \u2014 the Beijing-based creator of massive social video app TikTok \u2014 had no compunctions about building political suppression into its rules worldwide. ByteDance has even faced accusations that it censored videos about the Hong Kong protests, although that\u2019s a harder claim to prove.\n\nChina isn\u2019t the only country that pressures Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other tech companies to remove certain content \u2014 European \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d laws can be used as censorship tools, for instance. Other authoritarian countries have influence in Silicon Valley \u2014 particularly Saudi Arabia, a major tech investor. Fears about the Chinese government have created a factually dubious panic around companies like Huawei, which has been widely banned from operating in the US. At least one American company, Facebook, has used these fears as ammunition against antitrust investigators \u2014 claiming that if regulators check Facebook\u2019s power, a pro-censorship Chinese alternative will take its place.\n\nAnd the anger over Morey\u2019s statement isn\u2019t necessarily a top-down sentiment from the government. Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai argued that he\u2019d offended local Rockets fans by questioning China\u2019s sovereignty \u2014 and although there\u2019s plenty of disingenuous propaganda online, Vox notes that there\u2019s also a lot of sincere nationalism among real citizens. That doesn\u2019t, however, change the fact that the NBA is suppressing support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nBetween China\u2019s massive economic power, its government\u2019s penchant for heavy-handed propaganda, and its terrifyingly comprehensive surveillance state, there\u2019s reason to worry when American companies are so sensitive about what their employees put online. And as tech companies face pressure from governments across the world \u2014 often for failing to remove harmful material \u2014 there\u2019s ever more reason to avoid offending China. An NBA manager deleting a tweet will have very little effect on most people\u2019s lives. But this is ultimately an issue for anybody who puts their opinion online.", "description": "The backlash over a pro-Hong Kong protestor tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey is a microcosm of larger problems with Chinese censorship and online speech.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fTiS_3luSV-egS5xzwWsteuAsh8=/0x0:5008x2622/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19268171/1179511550.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
