REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis\n\nNew Delhi\u2019s air quality index was around 300 on Thursday, classified as very poor and meaning prolonged exposure can cause respiratory illness.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has described the city as a \u201cgas chamber\u201d in winter, has ordered emergency measures, including restricting the number of private vehicles on the roads under an \u201codd-even\u201d scheme based on number plates.\n\nRace organisers said pollution was a worry but they would take steps to reduce the impact on runners. Hours ahead of and throughout the race, the course will be sprayed with water.\n\n\u201cThe air quality is a concern and will remain a concern, there is no question about it,\u201d said Vivek Singh, joint managing director of Procam International that conducts the race sponsored by telecom operator Bharti Airtel.\n\n\u201cThe measures that we take for those few hours to give our runners a good experience have worked in the past.\u201d\n\nThe race has been moved this year to avoid a sharp rise in pollutants during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, when hundreds of thousands of firecrackers are lit.\n\nBut farmers burning crop stubble in the states north of Delhi have turned the air over Delhi toxic. The forecast for the next few days and into Sunday is \u201cvery poor\u201d.\n\nA record 40,633 people have signed up for the 21-km, 10-km and a 5-km races. Last year there were 34,916 runners, many of whom wore masks.\n\nA former Olympic gold medallist, Carmelita Jeter of the United States, is the international event ambassador.\n\nDoctors have advised citizens to restrict their outdoor activities and said runners must be made aware of the risks they are taking.\n\n\u201cJust two weeks before the odd-even scheme comes into play, how have the civic authorities allowed more than 30,000 people to expose themselves to toxic air?\u201d asked said Desh Deepak, senior chest physician at the city\u2019s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.", "description": "Tens of thousands of runners have signed up for the Indian capital's half marathon and other races on Sunday, officials said, despite the air quality hitting dangerous levels in one of the most heavily polluted cities in the world.", "authors": ["Neha Dasgupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441863737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G13Z", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
