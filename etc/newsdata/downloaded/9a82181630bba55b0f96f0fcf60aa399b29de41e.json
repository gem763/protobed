Schumer said they offered to join him in a \u201chistoric signing ceremony\u201d at the White House should it pass the Senate.\n\n\u201cThis morning, we made it clear to the President that any proposal that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe will not stop until these bills are passed and our children\u2019s lives are safe. We call upon Senator McConnell to \u2018Give Us a Vote!\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the White House, the conversation between party leaders was \u201ccordial,\u201d but the president made no commitments regarding the Democrats\u2019 background check bill.\n\n\u201cInstead [he] indicated his interest in working to find a bipartisan legislative solution on appropriate responses to the issue of mass gun violence. The President reiterated his commitment for his administration to continue work on these issues,\u201d Deputy Press Secretary Judson Deere wrote in a statement.\n\nThe bill in question, which passed earlier this year on a mostly partisan vote, would extend background checks to private sales \u2014 something that gravely concerns conservatives.\n\nMr. McConnell has not taken up any background check or other gun-control bills since returning from the August recess, saying he is waiting to see what Mr. Trump would be supportive of signing.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
