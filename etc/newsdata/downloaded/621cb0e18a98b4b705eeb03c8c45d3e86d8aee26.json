In 1933, a Portland jury failed to convict Jake Silverman, a Jewish immigrant and alleged gangster accused of murdering a man and woman, after a single juror held out on the murder charge. Silverman instead received a three-year sentence for manslaughter. The result sparked public outrage in an age of nativism and anti-Semitism, including rumors that the holdout had themselves been Jewish.\n\n\u201cThis newspaper\u2019s opinion is that the increased urbanization of American life ... and the vast immigration into America from southern and eastern Europe, of people untrained in the jury system, have combined to make the jury of twelve increasingly unwieldy and unsatisfactory,\u201d The Morning Oregonian wrote in an editorial shortly after the trial.\n\nOregon lawmakers, responding to the uproar, responded by drafting a constitutional amendment to allow felony convictions on a 11\u20131 or 10\u20132 vote. It received the voters\u2019 assent in 1934 with 59 percent in favor of it. It would be another three decades before the provision came before the Supreme Court.\n\nOver the past century, the justices have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply the Bill of Rights\u2019 protections against federal abuses to the states. Last term, for instance, the court ruled that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on excessive fines applies when states like Indiana try to seize its residents\u2019 cars for minor drug offenses. This process, known as incorporation, means that there is now little daylight between how the Bill of Rights affects state and federal power.\n\nThe court incorporated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in 1968. But in the 1972 case Apodaca v. Oregon, the court, in a 5\u20134 decision, upheld Oregon\u2019s non-unanimous conviction rule. The decision was far from clean. Four of the justices strongly rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments; four of them voted to strike down the Oregon provision. Justice Lewis Powell provided a fifth vote in Oregon\u2019s favor to resolve the case.\n\nPowell did not join the plurality\u2019s opinion, however. Instead, he wrote a narrower concurring opinion laying out his own views on the matter. \u201cThere is no reason to believe, on the basis of experience in Oregon or elsewhere, that a unanimous decision of 12 jurors is more likely to serve the high purpose of jury trial, or is entitled to greater respect in the community, than the same decision joined in by 10 members of a jury of 12,\u201d Powell wrote. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents, the narrowest opinion in the majority is considered to be the controlling one for lower courts to follow.\n\nThe Supreme Court is typically reluctant to overturn its own precedents. But Ramos contends that the splintered outcome should weaken its grip on the justices today. \u201cTo be sure, Justice Powell\u2019s decisive opinion in Apodaca balked at requiring the states to abide by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s unanimity requirement,\u201d his lawyers wrote in their brief for the court. \u201cBut this vote need not be accorded stare decisis weight because all eight other Justices in the Court\u2019s splintered ruling disagreed with Justice Powell.\u201d\n\nRamos argues that unanimity is vital to a jury\u2019s proper functioning. \u201cIf one or two jurors harbor doubt about the prosecution\u2019s theory or questions regarding the adequacy of defense counsel\u2019s efforts, they may effectively require the others to engage in discussion,\u201d his lawyers told the court. Transforming juries into a mere straw poll, on the other hand, runs counter to both popular expectations and its constitutional role. \u201cTo illustrate the point by way of a cultural touchstone: Without the unanimity rule, the play Twelve Angry Men would have ended on page eleven,\u201d they wrote.\n\nLouisiana is not the same state that it was in 1898, but the shadow of the past still looms over the system. Using data from investigative journalists, Harvard University law professor Thomas Frampton found evidence of significant racial disparities in the way Louisiana\u2019s non-unanimity rule functions in practice. While black jurors accounted for 31 percent of the votes cast in the cases at hand, he wrote in a Vanderbilt Law Review article in 2018, they cast 51 percent of the votes that didn\u2019t count under the non-unanimity rule.\n\nThe rule not only diminishes the ability of black jurors to influence the system, it makes it harder for black defendants to avoid convictions. \u201cIn the 28 non-unanimous convictions in Orleans Parish for which data is available, for example, white jurors and black jurors served in roughly equal numbers,\u201d Frampton wrote. \u201cYet black jurors cast more than twice the number of \u2018empty votes\u2019 for acquittal than did white jurors.\u201d That gap has consequences. \u201cWhen a conviction is obtained against a black defendant, there is a 43% chance that the verdict was non-unanimous,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen the convicted defendant is white, there is only a 33% chance the verdict was non-unanimous.\u201d\n\nLouisiana disputes Ramos\u2019s interpretation of Apodaca and the Sixth Amendment. But it also leans heavily on the practical consequences of a ruling in his favor. \u201cOverturning Apodaca, moreover, would lead to significant practical problems and would unsettle related areas of the law,\u201d the state told the court. \u201cThe ink will not even be dry on this Court\u2019s opinion before the lower courts begin receiving thousands of petitions for habeas relief seeking to apply a mandatory unanimity rule retroactively to long-final convictions in Louisiana and Oregon.\u201d\n\nOregon chimed in with an equally dire warning. \u201cOregon courts have given a non-unanimous jury instruction in almost every single felony jury-trial case for the past 47 years,\u201d the state said in its brief to the court. \u201cTens of thousands of jurors have followed those instructions in carrying out their deliberations. If this court were to overrule Apodaca, it would invalidate convictions in hundreds if not thousands of cases.\u201d A coalition of states led by New York dispute that claim, however, noting that the Supreme Court\u2019s rules in other cases make it hard for defendants to obtain retroactive relief.\n\nThe two states have it right, but the wrong way around. What\u2019s more troubling than the prospect of retrials is the possibility that Louisiana and Oregon sentenced thousands of people to prison who might have gone free if dissenting jurors\u2019 voices had mattered. This was not an accident or a flaw in the system; it was by design. There\u2019s been plenty of scrutiny in recent years on how the Roberts Court respects precedents. In this instance, the precedent isn\u2019t worth the respect.", "description": "Two states are asking the justices to retain a rule from America's racist past for the sake of convenience.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d2257875589e30aac65671a2ed27cf172071bc3d.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
