House Democrats hope to conclude their work by the end of the year.\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department has not commented on Volker\u2019s resignation, which was first reported by the State Press, Arizona State University\u2019s student newspaper. The departure was confirmed by a person familiar with the events who requested anonymity to discuss a personnel matter.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine resigned, a student newspaper beat everyone to the story\n\nVolker, a former career diplomat who heads the McCain Institute at ASU, had worked at the Ukraine job part time for the past two years.\n\nAD\n\nHe worked for months to facilitate a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the young anti-corruption reformer elected in April. Despite Volker\u2019s efforts, that meeting that may have been held up as part of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign.\n\nThe committee is expected to examine Volker\u2019s role in facilitating contacts between Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani and officials of the new Ukrainian government this past summer. Those efforts appear to have been aimed at separating Giuliani\u2019s interest in investigating Biden from official U.S. dealings with the new Ukrainian government.\n\nAD\n\nVolker was apparently not on a July telephone call between Trump and Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) last week.\n\nAD\n\nBut Volker could be a significant figure in the inquiry because of his potential knowledge of Giuliani\u2019s efforts, which Giuliani has claimed without corroboration had come at the behest of the State Department. If Volker was concerned about Giuliani and how he could shield Ukraine from any damaging interactions with the president\u2019s private attorney, House Democrats will want to know.\n\nHow the Trump whistleblower painstakingly gathered the material\n\nVolker, according to the complaint, traveled to Kiev the day after Trump\u2019s July 25 call to Zelensky. He was accompanied by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a Trump ally.\n\n\u201cBased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani has long been a proponent of unsubstantiated theories that Biden\u2019s son Hunter profited improperly from work in Ukraine and that as vice president Joe Biden helped wave off a Ukraine corruption investigation that could have ensnared his son. There is no evidence of that. There is also no evidence to substantiate the separate claim aired by Trump last week that officials in Ukraine had helped his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, or that deleted emails from her time as secretary of state might reside in Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani has published images of messages he exchanged with Volker to refute the notion that he was freelancing.\n\nAfter a brief stint as a CIA analyst, Volker joined the State Department in 1988 and worked largely on European issues. He rose to become European director at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, whom he served for less than a year as U.S. ambassador to NATO before being replaced after Barack Obama\u2019s election.\n\nVolker kept his job as executive director of the McCain Institute, dedicated to developing \u201ccharacter-driven leaders\u201d in memory of the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), after he was tapped in 2017 as Ukraine envoy by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\nAD", "description": "Volker\u2019s resignation came as congressional Democrats scheduled an interview with him next week.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hrUGMKqF-pc2XOehMEKhbHrODT0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4ZJZJGXBQMI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
