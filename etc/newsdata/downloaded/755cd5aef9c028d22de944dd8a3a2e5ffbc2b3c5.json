ORCL, -1.58%\n\nMicrosoft MSFT, -0.20% seems like a smart way to play software due to its diversified business makeup and clear visibility into double-digit revenue growth going forward, Thill wrote. He sees numerous growth drivers for Microsoft, including its Azure, Office, and LinkedIn businesses, which give the company the \u201cgreatest exposure to [software-as-a-service] revenue among any of the major public cloud players.\u201d\n\nThe stock is down 0.5% in Tuesday\u2019s session on a down day for the market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.98% off 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.10% off 1.18%.\n\nOpinion: Third time\u2019s a charm? Microsoft makes a risky gamble back into smartphones\n\nThill was less upbeat on Oracle, moving Jefferies\u2019 rating on the stock down to hold from buy amid growth struggles on the top line and his projection that the company will have trouble accelerating growth in a meaningful fashion going forward.\n\n\u201cOracle continues to lag peers in the public cloud; its infrastructure-as-a-service offering has had limited uptake among new and existing customers,\u201d Thill wrote. \u201cAlthough the autonomous database on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] is a step in the right direction, we believe the gap to AWS and Azure might be too significant to narrow (with [Google Cloud Platform] likely to become a worthy contender as well).\u201d\n\nOracle shares are off 1.5% in Tuesday trading. The company confirmed Tuesday that it was planning to hire about 2,000 employees as it builds out its cloud-infrastructure unit.\n\nRead: Microsoft announces new laptop and tablets, but the real fun comes next year\n\nThill also downgraded shares of Carbonite Inc. CARB, -4.33% and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. CHKP, -1.21% , citing the potential for execution risk with both names. Carbonite has missed revenue forecasts in three of the last four quarters and doesn\u2019t have a \u201cconfidence-inspiring\u201d outlook ahead, according to Thill. He doubts Check Point\u2019s stock will appreciate significantly unless the company can deliver a \u201csignificant catalyst\u201d that can drive revenue growth above single digits.\n\nCarbonite\u2019s stock is down nearly 4% in Tuesday trading, while Check Point\u2019s has fallen 1.8%.", "description": "Sky-high valuations for software stocks necessitate a more defensive view of the industry, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, and Microsoft Corp....", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GS465_micros_ZG_20181025200013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
