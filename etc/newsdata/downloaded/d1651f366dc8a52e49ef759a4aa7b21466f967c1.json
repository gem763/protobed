It emerged this week that he had helped organise a meeting between Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and a Ukraine presidential aide. Giuliani was trying to convince the new government of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate of the son of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s possible opponent in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nVolker\u2019s resignation was first reported in an Arizona student newspaper, the State Press.\n\nIn the congressional letter delivered on Friday, three House committees demanded the documents as part of their investigation into \u201cthe extent to which President Trump jeopardised national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression\u201d.\n\nTrump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal Read more\n\nThe chairmen of the intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees also warned Pompeo that \u201cyour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry\u201d.\n\nThe committees sent a separate note to Pompeo notifying him of a rapid schedule of depositions they expected to hold with five state department officials involved in contacts with Ukraine. The list begins next Wednesday with the former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was forced to retire from the post in May, earlier than planned.\n\nTrump, according to the White House version of his 25 July conversation with Zelenskiy, was scathing about Yovanovitch, referring to her as \u201cthe woman\u201d who was \u201cbad news\u201d, and who was \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d.\n\nVolker is due to appear before the congressional committees the day after Yovanovitch\u2019s scheduled deposition. He was mentioned in the whistleblower complaint as helping Zelenskiy help \u201cnavigate\u201d the president\u2019s demands. Giuliani has publicly displayed text messages purportedly from Volker, about a meeting had helped arrange with a Zelenskiy aide.\n\nGiuliani was seeking to persuade the Kyiv government to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former vice-president Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s possible Democratic opponent in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nDemocrats question state department dealings with Ukraine and Giuliani Read more\n\nThe younger Biden had been on the board of an Ukrainian energy company, but an Ukrainian investigation found no evidence of impropriety.\n\nShortly before making the call to Zelenskiy in July, to press him further on investigating Biden, Trump ordered the suspension of US military aid to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Pompeo claimed to have been too busy to read more than a couple paragraphs of the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine, and insisted that no state department official had done anything appropriate.\n\nIn their letter to Pompeo, the three committee chairman, noted that he had first been asked to hand over relevant documentation on 9 September, but had not complied.\n\n\u201cYour actions are all the more troubling given that since our 9 September request, it has become clear that multiple state department officials have direct knowledge of the subject matters of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d the chairmen \u2013 Democrats Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings \u2013 said.\n\nPompeo\u2019s continued refusal to hand over the documents, they added, would impair Congress\u2019s \u201cconstitutional responsibilities to protect our national security and the integrity of our democracy\u201d.", "description": "Kurt Volker, special envoy for Ukraine, had helped plan a meeting between Giuliani and a Ukraine presidential aide", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8be80ba3b766cf51108f715bc6c2042cdbc140a9/0_129_3887_2334/master/3887.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b63704a3bdffa46f85813686720557f3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
