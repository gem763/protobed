Those facts cannot be seriously contested,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly suggested Schiff be tried for treason, called the lawmaker \u201ca sick puppy\u201d Friday in another furious Twitter outburst.\n\nAs Democrats raised their attacks on Trump, many Republicans remained muted, supportive of the president but keeping a distance.\n\nBreaking with the pack, Republican Senator Mitt Romney blasted Trump\u2019s comments that Beijing and Kiev should investigate Biden for corruption.\n\n\u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\u201d tweeted Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Democratic lawmakers on Friday demanded that the White House turn over documents related to allegations that President Donald", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/6b0e18_impeachment-pressure-on-us-president-donald-trump-mounted-as-democratic-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
