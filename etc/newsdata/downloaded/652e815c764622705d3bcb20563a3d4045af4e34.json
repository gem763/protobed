Will Canada forgive him?", "language": "en", "text": "\"He's a hypocrite,\" said \u00c8ve Gaboury, 19, who studies environmental geography at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. She said she could forgive the blackface, but never the pipeline.\n\nTrudeau swept into power four years ago in a surprise victory, becoming a global symbol of liberalism even as right-wing populism took hold in many other democracies. He drew young supporters by presenting himself as a champion of women and indigenous people, and he committed to the fight against global warming.\n\nA Tibetan monk shakes hands with Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who polls put neck-and-neck with Trudeau. AP\n\nHis government made a splash early on, unveiling one of the most gender-balanced Cabinets in the world, legalising recreational marijuana and welcoming more than 25,000 Syrian refugees.\n\nHe also successfully navigated a mercurial US president and clinched a sweeping trade deal with the United States. Under his watch, the Canadian economy is buoyant.\n\nBut his vow to bring a different \"sunny\" approach to politics was undercut earlier this year by his intervention in a criminal case involving a major Canadian engineering company.\n\nTrudeau said he was trying to save jobs by pressing his attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to ask for a civil penalty instead of pursuing the criminal prosecution. But Wilson-Raybould, who is indigenous, accused Trudeau and his mostly male aides of improperly pressuring her, and said she felt bullied.\n\nA federal ethics commissioner ruled that Trudeau broke a conflict of interest law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the public echoed its dismay: Here was a leader who promised a new, honest, open approach to governing, inserting politics into a criminal case.\n\nThat was troubling to many, and it damaged his image, but that was not all.\n\nEarlier in his tenure, he had used $C4.5 billion ($5 billion) in government money to buy a pipeline connecting Alberta's oil sands to the Pacific Coast. The purchase riled many environmentalists, who said he was more concerned about Canada's energy industry than about the environment.\n\nMore recently, he took his family on a state visit to India, where they all dressed in sumptuous local garb. It may have been intended as good-natured, but instead appeared culturally insensitive and became an exercise in national cringing.\n\nThen there were the old images of him in dressing up in brownface or blackface at least three times \u2014 including in a video in which he is seen wearing an Afro wig and sticking his tongue out.\n\n\"I'm sorry I hurt people,\" Trudeau recently told young twin black girls in one of his many public apologies during the campaign.\n\nAll of this might prove too much for Trudeau to overcome.\n\nWith an approval rating at about 35 per cent, half what it was during his first full year in office, he is in a close race as Canadians choose their new Parliament. Experts say he faces the possibility of becoming a one-term prime minister or, with low turnout, ending up governing with a potentially unstable minority government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trudeau's Liberal Party has been tied with its main opponent, the Conservatives, led by Andrew Scheer, although several analysts said that over the weekend, there was a slight shift in Trudeau's favour.\n\nOn the left, Trudeau's party is challenged by the New Democratic Party and the Greens.\n\nTrudeau is pushing back, and not merely by apologising. He is also emphasising his liberal agenda and arguing that, if elected, the Conservatives will wipe away the progress the Liberals have made.\n\n\"We recognise there's much more to do for all the 900,000 people we've lifted out of poverty; there are more people who need help,\" the 47-year-old Trudeau said last week in Fredericton, New Brunswick.\n\n\"Now is not the time to turn back,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau's image as an effective spokesman for Canada on the global stage was burnished last week when President Barack Obama, who was hugely popular in Canada during his presidency, endorsed Trudeau's reelection on Twitter, touting the prime minister as a progressive leader \"the world needs\".\n\nBut a campaign cannot erase the record \u2014 personal and professional \u2014 that has raised questions about his character.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, he's always wearing a mask,\" said Scheer, the Conservative leader, in a recent debate, mocking Trudeau for saying he could not remember how many times he had worn blackface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The embattled Prime Minister continues to emphasise his liberal agenda and to argue that, if elected, the Conservatives will wipe away the progress the Liberals have made.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2976%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2545bb69a690b4617ebb7ec5c68626880c8f2e3b", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
