A friend gave them tickets to see the event at The Forum in Los Angeles \u2014 after their regular services of course\n\nConcert: Kanye performed songs from his new album, Jesus is King, along with a choir\n\nHaving a blast: Jinger and Jeremy both shared videos from the show\n\nJeremy appears to have had a major fanboy weekend, first spending his Saturday night viewing the Jesus is King film.8\n\nHe shared a photo of the credits on Instagram, as well as his thoughts.\n\n'God's name is exalted,' he wrote. 'Kanye seems broken & humbled before his Creator. It was theologically spot-on.'\n\nBut the movie wasn't enough for Jeremy, who grew up in a more secular household than Jinger. (In a recent episode of Counting On, he talked about listening to NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys growing up, two bands Jinger didn't know.)\n\nOn Sunday, the couple shared videos of themselves attending Sunday Service at the Forum, dressed up in suits.\n\nA friend had provided tickets for the couple, who watched on in the same venue as Kim, Khloe, Kourtney, Kris, and Kendall \u2014 though it doesn't seem that the Vuolos crossed paths with the Kardashians.\n\nJinger, of course, may not have recognized any of them anyway. Growing up, her family didn't have a TV. She also only listened to religious and bluegrass music, and was almost entirely sheltered from pop culture and celebrities.\n\nOn camera: Jeremy recorded Jinger and himself walking in wearing their Sunday best\n\nFamily affair: Also there was most of the Kardashian clan, including Khloe Kardashian and several of the kids\n\nReality stars: Kendall Jenner shared Instagram stories from the venue, too\n\nStar power: Kris Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian smiled on the floor of the event\n\nAt Sunday Service, Kanye performed songs from Jesus is King backed by his Sunday Service choir, and both Jinger and Jeremy shared clips on their Instagram stories.\n\nFound God: Kanye's new album Jesus is King has a heavy focus on religion\n\nIn one that Jeremy uploaded, the choir sings a rendition of O Fortuna from Carmina Burana with new Kanye-approved religious lyrics, and a man can be heard exclaiming 'oh, s***' in the audience \u2014 something that likely never happens at Jinger and Jeremy's regular church services.\n\nAfter the show, Jeremy uploaded a long-winded 18-minute video of himself speaking in-depth about Kanye's religious awakening.\n\nJeremy, wearing a sweater over a collared shirt while sitting in front of the camera, said that the pair attended the show only after their regular church service. Jeremy had already listened to the new album and watched the film.\n\n'Kanye West is claiming to be a born-again believer. A born-again Christian,' he said.\n\nHe explained that Kanye recently formed a relationship with Placerita Bible Church's Adam Tyson, a graduate of the Master\u2019s Seminary, which Jeremy currently attends in Los Angeles. Jeremy seems delighted by the link.\n\nGet comfortable: Jeremy spoke at great length about his thoughts on Kanye being a born-again Christian\n\n'In God's providence, Kanye began attending,' he said. 'And when he heard that pastor preach, apparently he was struck by it. [He] said that he had never heard preaching like that in his life, and so they've been connecting an that pastor has been leading bible studies for him.'\n\nJeremy became aware of this in the past few months, and it intrigued him.\n\nI've been obviously praying for Kanye Jeremy Vuolo\n\n'I've been praying about it, and obviously praying for Kanye,' he said. 'Now with his album dropping, it's interesting to listen to it... but it's also interesting to see a lot of the reactions. Some people [are] vehemently against it.\n\n'So I just wanted to give my thoughts, having now listened to the album a couple of times,' he went on.\n\n'I'm no Kanye expert, but obviously he's gone through phases in the past making very blasphemous claims. I know some of his previous albums were very explicitly blasphemous.'\n\nKanye's 2013 album, Yeezus, includes a song called I Am a God, to say nothing about lyrics about sex and threesomes.\n\nIntro to rap: He listened to the album and saw the new Jesus is King film that Kanye put out as well, saying it was 'theologically spot-on'\n\n'The claim that Kanye is making [now] is that he's been regenerated, meaning that he's been born again.\n\n'[It's] the claim that you have been regenerated, literally born again, recreated, so you're a new creation. So think about what Kanye is claiming for himself \u2014 he's claiming regeneration, not a minor shift in his moral compass.\n\nIt encourages me to see that Kanye is not only claiming to be born again, but he's surrounding himself with really good people that are theologically sound Jeremy Vuolo\n\nJeremy warned others not to judge or to '[look] at a sinner like Kanye West and [say], \"Jesus could never save him\" or \"How dare you claim that Jesus would save him, he's still the same old filthy sinner.\"'\n\n'If you listen to what Kanye is saying in his interviews, he's declaring to the world... what God has done for him. Be careful that you don't quickly disparage that,' he said.\n\nHe also praised the 'theologically sound' men who are 'discipling' Kanye.\n\n'Kanye is surrounding himself with good people,' he added. 'So that gives me confidence.\n\n'It encourages me to see that Kanye is not only claiming to be born again, but he's surrounding himself with really good people that are theologically sound.'\n\nJeremy's seal of approval: Jeremy noted that Kanye has 'gone through phases in the past making very blasphemous claims' but he finds this new direction encouraging\n\nLoved it: He said Kanye's Sunday Service 'struck me as an outburst of praise coming from a captive soul that's been set free'\n\nSpeaking of Sunday Service in particular, Jeremy praised the 'astonishing' musical performance.\n\n'It struck me as an outburst of praise coming from a captive soul that's been set free,' he said.\n\n[Sunday Service] struck me as an outburst of praise coming from a captive soul that's been set free Jeremy Vuolo\n\n'I enjoyed it. I think, honestly, from an artistic, from a musical perspective, it was one of the greatest pieces of art, of musical art, that I've ever witnessed live.'\n\nSo far, his favorite song on the album is Closed on Sunday.\n\n'It seems kind of silly at first, but listen to the lyrics. And I appreciate what he's saying about training our children in the fear and admonition of the Lord and resisting temptation. It seems to be a song that's spot-on.'\n\nLyrics from the song include 'Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A / Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away / Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray.'\n\nJinger didn't share her own thoughts on Kanye's music or Sunday Service, though it was presumably eye-opening for her.\n\nLeggy lady: Jinger spoke about her decision to wear pants in a recent episode of TLC's Counting On\n\nMixing it up: Jinger still wears dresses and skirts, which she wore exclusively growing up\n\nModern woman: But she has also added pants and jeans into her wardrobe\n\nGrowing up, the Duggar children had little exposure to celebrities and pop culture. In the most recent episode of Counting On, Jeremy expresses excitement over stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys, and Jinger makes it clear that she is only familiar with them through Jeremy.\n\nHer siblings express complete confusion over the names of the boy bands.\n\nDuggar-watchers were also surprised this summer when Jinger and Jeremy met Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer Parker in the Back to the Future films. Commenters wondered if Jinger had even heard of the films, much less seen then.\n\nBut Jinger's horizons have expanded since she wed Jeremy, even moreso now that they've moved to Los Angeles.\n\nShe is one of only two adult Duggar children \u2014 the other being big sister Jill \u2014 to ditch their parents' skirts-and-dresses-only rule for girls and incorporate pants into her wardrobe.\n\nUntil she married, she followed their rules, which included a strict code of modest dressing that involved only skirts and dresses \u2014 hitting below the knee \u2014 for girls and women.\n\nJinger (far left) said: 'I think for me personally, my parents always raised us to honor Christ in everything that we do. That's where the Lord's led me as of now'\n\nIt's OK: She and her mother Michelle insisted there is no rift between them over the pants-wearing\n\nIn the most recent episode of TLC's Counting On, Jinger said that she believes the Lord has led her to this wardrobe change, and insists that departing from her parents' rules hasn't caused any tension with mom and dad.\n\n'Why did I decide to incorporate pants into my wardrobe? she said. 'I think for me personally, my parents always raised us to honor Christ in everything that we do. That's where the Lord's led me as of now.'\n\n'Growing up, my parents instilled in us the importance of modesty. And so I'm really, really grateful for that foundation and for that training,' she added.\n\nShe also said that she discussed the change with her parents before it happened, and insisted that it has not contributed to a rift between them, as some people have speculated.\n\n'We had conversations before I started wearing pants and I just shared my heart with them and where I saw the Lord leading me,' she said.\n\n'I was really grateful for their response. They said just to walk with the Lord convictionally, and to seek to honor him and to maintain modesty.'", "description": "Fundamentalist Christians Jinger, 25, and Jeremy, 32, attended Kanye's Sunday Service at The Forum in LA on Sunday.
