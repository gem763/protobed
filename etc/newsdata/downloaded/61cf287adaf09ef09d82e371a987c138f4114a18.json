Not even the second, or the third.\n\nThe haze, as it is commonly known, has been blanketing the region on an almost annual basis since 1997.\n\n\"What I\u2019m really worried about is long-term malignancy,\" Dr Amar Singh, a senior consultant paediatrician based in the Malaysian city of Ipoh, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It\u2019s like the entire country is smoking cigarettes. You can stay in your home, but you are still going to breathe in the particulate matter.\"\n\nAs environment ministers from Southeast Asia gather for a three-day summit in Siem Reap, Cambodia beginning on Monday, the issue takes the spotlight following the recent haze in the region.\n\nOriginating in fires on the peat-rich islands of Borneo and Sumatra, Southeast Asia\u2019s haze is a potentially carcinogenic cocktail of chemicals including carbon monoxide, cyanide and formaldehyde as well as microscopic particles of ash, wood and other substances that can lodge deep inside the body.\n\nThe first incidence of trans-boundary haze coincided with the development of the pulp and paper and palm oil industries in Indonesia and Malaysia, as landowners turned to fire as the quickest and cheapest way to clear the rainforest.\n\nOver the years, the industry has continued to expand, and palm oil has become almost ubiquitous \u2013 an ingredient in products from makeup to ice cream and floor cleaner. Malaysia and Indonesia have become the world\u2019s top two producers.\n\n\"The haze has become steadily worse and more frequent, roughly reflecting the way land has been opened up for plantations,\" explained Helena Varkkey, an expert on tropical peatland at the University of Malaya and author of The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia: Palm Oil and Patronage.\n\nIllegal blazes to clear land for agricultural plantations have raged across Indonesia's Sumatra and Borneo islands for the past few years [Ulet IfansastiGetty Images)\n\nShe notes much of the converted land is peat swamp forest that has to be drained before it can be used for agriculture.\n\n\"The issue is that newly-opened land may be burned or catch fire soon after the drainage stage,\" she said. \"But old land, which has been on fire before, also tends to burn again. So, the problem is compounding year after year.\"\n\n1997 state of emergency\n\nIn the catastrophic haze of 1997, Malaysia was forced to declare a state of emergency in its Borneo state of Sarawak as the air pollution index rose to hazardous levels, while the air in Singapore turned a sickly yellow.\n\nEven the Philippines and Thailand were affected. Close to the hotspots in Indonesia, the air pollution index exceeded the maximum level of 1,000, more than three times the level considered hazardous.\n\nMore than 40,000 people were hospitalised as a result of the pollution, and the economic, social and environmental damage was estimated around $9bn, according to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nThe burning of 1997 was a wake-up call to governments around the region, which began to take steps towards addressing the blazes, which also contribute towards greenhouse gas emissions as the burning peat releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe ASEAN Haze Agreement was adopted in 2002 - the same year another bout of fire-fuelled pollution smothered the region - and included prevention measures, particularly in peatlands, monitoring initiatives and emergency response procedures with a goal of achieving a haze-free ASEAN by 2020. A regional fund was also established to help with some of the costs of haze prevention and fire control.\n\nSustainability standards\n\nIn 2004, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was set up, bringing together plantations companies, palm oil buyers, banks and environmental groups to set sustainability standards for the industry.\n\nIt has gradually tightened its certification standards and last year added \"no peat\" to the requirements. About 19 percent of global palm oil is now certified by RSPO.\n\nIndonesia has also taken steps to address the haze. Using fire to clear forest has been an offence since 1999, with a jail term of 10 years for those found guilty.\n\nIn 2011, the country introduced a nationwide moratorium on the conversion of primary forest into plantations and in 2014, finally ratified the ASEAN haze agreement, the last of the organisation's 10 members to do so.\n\nOver the same period, the palm oil industry has become increasingly important to the economies of Malaysia and Indonesia. The edible oil is grown not only by smallholders but also huge conglomerates, some of which have their corporate headquarters in Singapore.\n\nIn 2014, the city-state passed a landmark law allowing it to prosecute companies for actions creating haze in Singapore.\n\nThe legislation rests on the presumption that if satellite imagery shows a fire within the borders of a company\u2019s concession with the wind blowing in the direction of Singapore, then the haze can be presumed to have come from there.\n\nThe investigation into four Indonesian companies for their role in the 2015 haze \"remains open\", the country\u2019s National Environmental Agency told Al Jazeera in an email. It is \"monitoring the situation closely\" in relation to the 2019 disaster, it added.\n\nThe politics of haze\n\nFor the Singapore act to be effective, it needs maps and Indonesia\u2019s cooperation.\n\nThe fires contribute towards greenhouse gas emissions by releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [File: Willy Kurniawan/Reuters]\n\n\"A significant part of the haze problem does boil down to politics, the decentralised nature of governance in Indonesia and the lobbying power of the plantation companies, especially at the provincial and regency levels with local leaders,\" said Alan Tan, a law professor at the National University of Singapore and an expert on the transboundary haze law.\n\nIndonesia has refused to publish detailed plantation concession maps despite a court ruling ordering it to do so, and it emerged earlier this year that companies found guilty of burning land in the years since 2009 had failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.\n\nIn Malaysia, companies have suggested publishing the maps would contravene state secrets.\n\nAfter he toured smouldering tracts of land in Sumatra last month, President Joko Widodo admitted his government had been \"negligent\" in preparing for this year\u2019s dry season.\n\nThe authorities have identified 16 domestic and international companies - some Malaysian - and scores of individuals that it says were responsible for this year\u2019s fires. Some plantations have been sealed off.\n\nBut the challenges of regional cooperation will be on show in Siem Reap again this week, as ASEAN holds its annual ministerial meeting on the haze.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar has not attended since 2015, and last month Malaysia was responsible for the haze that had enveloped the country, despite ASEAN monitoring showing the vast majority of fire hotspots were in Indonesia itself.\n\nShe did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s multiple requests for comment on the meeting, the fires or Indonesia\u2019s efforts to stop them.\n\nA change in weather patterns and the arrival of rain has once again brought respite from the haze, removing some of the pressure on governments to enforce the law, and companies to take their sustainability commitments seriously.\n\n\"Everyone worries and cares about haze when it\u2019s in their faces,\" Varkkey said. \"But when the sky clears, the problem is out of sight and out of mind.\"\n\nBut as the vision of a haze-free ASEAN by 2020 recedes, there is no escaping the potential consequences of continued inaction on the health of both people and planet.\n\n\"If forests continue to be degraded or destroyed, human beings will no longer be able to enjoy the irreplaceable services that nature provides (and) which all of us depend on,\" WWF-Malaysia Conservation Director Henry Chan said in a statement.\n\n\"Clean air, water and food.\"\n\nAdditional reporting from Febriana Firdaus in Jakarta.", "description": "Environment ministers seek solution to recurring issue as activists urge governments to take more comprehensive action.", "authors": ["Kate Mayberry"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/e452d8bd1b5746f79bc85dde37bc23b3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
