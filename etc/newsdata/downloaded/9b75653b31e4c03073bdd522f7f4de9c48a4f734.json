(Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty)\n\nWell, well, well, isn\u2019t this Apple rumour just delicious.\n\nThis week, it was announced that J.J. Abrams had, with his wife and business partner Katie McGrath, inked a multi-year agreement with WarnerMedia to develop exclusive content, games, and other media through their production company Bad Robot in a deal believed to be worth around $US250 ($363) million. But the Hollywood Reporter reported on Friday numerous companies had a horse in this race, including Apple.\n\nAccording to the report, Abrams and McGrath met with Apple executives about a potential partnership and were offered a deal in the ballpark of $US500 ($727) million. But that handsome bid reportedly fell through over exclusivity restrictions, namely that Apple wanted to keep the visionary director all to itself. Imagine, for a moment, telling Abrams that he could no longer do Star Wars. Put another way, Apple didn\u2019t want to share its toys.\n\nDoes Apple TV+ Need To Be Good? With Apple\u2019s annual September event this year, we finally have answers around what its Netflix streaming contender will look like at launch: sparse in offerings and incredibly cheap \u2014 if not altogether free. But before we write it off entirely, Apple\u2019s TV+ foray into streaming may be smarter than it reads at first blush. In fact, this may be one of the rare occasions that Apple is being realistic about what it can feasibly pull off as it muscles its way into the streaming fray.

Unlike WarnerMedia, which baited Bad Robot with opportunities that include television, games, theatrical releases, and other digital media, Apple couldn\u2019t offer the same assurances about theatrical distribution. The Hollywood Reporter also cited speculative rumours that Bad Robot was unimpressed with Apple\u2019s March event at which it teased out its new services\u2014including Apple TV+ and Arcade\u2014though the report said sources close to both parties \u201ccategorically deny that his decision to sign with WarnerMedia had anything to do with that presentation.\u201d\n\nApple didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment about the report. Bad Robot\u2019s newly signed deal with WarnerMedia builds on a yearslong existing relationship the company has with Abrams. In a statement this week, Abrams said he was \u201cgrateful for the chance to write, produce and direct work for this incredible company, and to help create films and series with a diverse and vast collection of inspiring storytellers. We can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d\n\nApple, meanwhile, is selling us... well, whatever this turns out to be.", "description": "Well, well, well, isn\u2019t this Apple rumour just delicious....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/vl3fd1db3aycmfayclfp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
