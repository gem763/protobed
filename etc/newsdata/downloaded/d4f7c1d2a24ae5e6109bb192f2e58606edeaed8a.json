And while she knew her killer, they were not close friends and there was nothing to suggest that, on meeting her, he would embark on such a horrific attack.\n\n'This was a very complex case and the review found a number of areas of good practice by professionals, for instance the good work of her schools in reporting and following up episodes in which she had gone missing, the use of a variety of methods by police including social media to find her when this happened, and the efforts of professionals who built good working relationships with her.\n\n'It also made a number of findings, primarily around the limitations of one of the assessments of her, the way in which agencies respond to missing children reports, misperceptions around what constitutes good attendance at school, and communication and engagement with children, young people and their families - including the need to involve interpreters when English may not be a family's first language.\n\n'Importantly, the review makes eight recommendations for ways in which practice can be improved going forward, and these either have been or are being implemented by the Board and the agencies themselves.\n\nAn independent review published by Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children Board on Friday, which referred to Viktorija as Child N, described her killing as a 'tragic loss of a young, vibrant life'. Pictured: The murder scene in April last year)\n\n'As a Board, we have also held an internal learning review process in relation to the perpetrator; this has recently been concluded and has also identified a number of actions which are being implemented.'\n\nThe review noted that Viktorija's family's first language was Lithuanian, although she spoke English, Lithuanian and Russian.\n\nThe report said: 'There wasn't consensus amongst front line practitioners who came into direct contact with the family about how well Mother or Stepfather understood English.\n\n'It was identified that interpreters were not used by professionals consistently or effectively and there was a belief that the availability of Lithuanian interpreters was limited.'", "description": "The review of the death of Viktorija Sokolova (pictured) made eight recommendations to improve practices, but concluded there were 'no indications that her life was at risk' from Ayman Aziz.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19291922-0-image-a-30_1570183412883.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
