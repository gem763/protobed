F, +1.40% debt to BBB-, its lowest investment-grade rung, saying it doesn't see the car maker posting adjusted profit margins around 8% until at least 2022 thanks to the company's \"ongoing subpar performance in China and Europe,\" softening demand, and rising regulatory costs. The outlook is stable, S&P Global said. \"Ford is likely to face significant negative pressure from its higher-volume but lower-margin portfolio including cars and multi-activity ... until the company realigns its portfolio,\" S&P said. Ford earlier this week reported third-quarter earnings that were above expectations but said it expected increased headwinds in the fourth quarter. Ford shares have gained 14% this year, compared with gains of 16% for the S&P 500 index.", "description": "S&P Global Ratings late Friday downgraded Ford Motor Co. debt to BBB-, its lowest investment-grade rung, saying it doesn't see the car maker posting...", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
