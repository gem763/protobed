Artist's impression\n\nThe flare was seen coming from a star called NGTS J121939.5-355557. It was spotted by researchers using the Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) telescope array in Chile.\n\nThough M-type stars are known to have ultra-strong magnetic fields, typically preventing this type of outburst, the researchers say the rare event spotted in the recent study likely occurs about every three years.\n\n\u2018This is normally a star that shows little activity and stays a constant brightness,\u2019 said University of Warwick Ph.D. student James Jackman.\n\n\u2018Then, on this one particular night, we saw it suddenly grow seven times brighter than normal for a few hours, which is pretty extreme. And then after that it goes back to normal.\n\n\u2018We see these types of flares on the Sun, but no-where near as big as this,' the researcher says.\n\n\u2018On our Sun, you can do incredibly detailed studies on this kind of activity. It's difficult to extend that understanding to other stars because the data we need hasn't been available until now.\u2019\n\nAccording to the team, the star is what\u2019s known as a pre-main sequence star, meaning it\u2019s still in the early stages of its lifecycle.\n\n\u2018This is an incredibly young star, only about 2 million years old,\u2019 Jackman says.\n\n\u2018You'd call it a baby \u2013 it's going to live for ten of billions of years, so it's in the first one percent of its lifetime.\n\nA similar event spotted earlier this year coming from a red dwarf star was also said to be far more powerful than any event ever observed from our own sun. Experts say radiation from the blast would likely threaten the habitability of any planet in its vicinity. Artist's impression\n\n\u2018Even though it's much cooler than our Sun by about 2000 degrees it is roughly the same size, but pretty large for an M star.\n\n\u2018This is because it's still being formed from gas in the disc and contracting and cooling until it reaches the main sequence, staying at a certain radius and luminosity for billions of years.\n\n\u2018Finding out these kinds of details has only been possible thanks to the Gaia mission that began earlier this year.\u2019\n\nThe researchers say X-rays from huge stellar flares such as this may influence the formation of calcium-aluminium-rich grains called chondrules.\n\nThese arise in the star\u2019s protoplanetary disc, and eventually come together to be asteroids and ultimately, planets.\n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EARTH WHEN THE SUN DIES? Five billion years from now, it's said the sun will have grown into a red giant star, more than a hundred times larger than its current size. Eventually, it will eject gas and dust to create an 'envelope' accounting for as much as half its mass. The core will become a tiny white dwarf star. This will shine for thousands of years, illuminating the envelope to create a ring-shaped planetary nebula. Five billion years from now, it's said the sun will have grown into a red giant star, more than a hundred times larger than its current size (file photo) While this metamorphosis will change the solar system, scientists are unsure what will happen to the third rock from the sun. We already know that our sun will be bigger and brighter, so that it will probably destroy any form of life on our planet. But whether the Earth's rocky core will survive is uncertain.\n\n\u2018A massive flare like this could be advantageous for planet formation, or it could be disruptive,\u2019 says Professor Peter Wheatley.\n\n\u2018This particular star won't have formed its planets yet so this type of flare activity is something that astronomers will need to take into account when considering planet formation.\n\n\u2018There's a discussion at the moment around whether flares are a good or bad thing for life on orbiting habitable planets, because they output a large amount of UV radiation.\n\n\u2018That could cause biological damage to surface organisms and damage their DNA.\n\n\u2018On the other hand, UV radiation is required for various chemical reactions to start life and that's not typically provided in great enough quantity by these types of stars.\n\n\u2018These flares could potentially kickstart these reactions.\u2019\n\n:", "description": "Experts say the stellar \u2018tantrum\u2019 could provide a window into the birth of potentially habitable exoplanets, revealing how huge events shake up the material orbiting distant stars.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/21/23/7719522-0-image-a-26_1545433349628.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-21"}
