(AP) - Like any good Cajun story, this one starts at a zydeco jam.\n\nGrammy-nominated musician Yvette Landry bought a bass guitar on a whim, hoping to find some peace in a failing marriage and with her father battling brain cancer. Days after buying the guitar, Landry was invited to a jam on Gloria Switch Road.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would do anything with that guitar except maintaining my sanity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was something to think about other than what was going on in my life.\u201d\n\nAn old, north Lafayette home had been converted into a gift shop of sorts. Behind the counter sat an elderly, inquisitive man who hesitated when Landry name dropped a local musician. When she disclosed she was there to jam, he lead her through French doors to the back of the house.\n\nIn a glass enclosed porch, over 60 musicians, aged eight to 80, sat jamming simultaneously. Landry just sat and watched everyone play. At the end, she asked to come again next week and was welcomed with open arms.\n\nWhat started as a hobby almost 15 years ago now has Landry being inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. During Festivals Acadiens et Creoles, the Breaux Bridge native was inducted live on stage during her set at Salle de Danse on Oct. 12.\n\nAfter that first jam, Landry went back every Saturday, quickly adding a fiddle, guitar, and accordion to her repertoire.\n\n\u201cI was determined,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like \u2018I\u2019m gonna learn how to do all of this.\u2019 And I did it.\u201d\n\nAfter three months, Landry was invited to a jam in Rayne. However, things at the Rayne jam were run a little different. Bands were created from whoever showed up, rotating instruments through different groups. All would go on stage, play three songs and if there was someone else waiting to play, they would switch on stage.\n\nLandry was the last bass player to show up. After playing for over an hour, she had impressed a few people. Randy Vidrine, drummer for the Lafayette Rhythm Devils, asked if she was interested in playing with the band. To her own surprise, she said yes.\n\n\u201cIf you guys are crazy enough to ask me to go, I\u2019m kinda just crazy enough to go and do it,\u201d she said.\n\nWith an amp the size of a coffee cup, Landry played her first gig at Randol\u2019s, a Cajun restaurant, with only three months of experience under her belt. As she was leaving the venue, Vidrine paid her, and she was shocked. For the first time, she realized she could make money playing music.\n\nThe next day, he asked her to join the Lafayette Rhythm Devils. She\u2019s been with the band ever since.\n\nShe has also played with bands such as Yvette Landry & the Jukes and Bonsoir, Catin.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you what it felt like,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just the rush of playing music with some company.\u201d\n\nEven to this day she gets the same, indescribable feeling.\n\nMusic is far from Landry\u2019s only interest. The educator, musician, producer, author, songwriter, and cultural ambassador likes to stays busy.\n\n\u201cI have to be busy, I don\u2019t know what to do if I\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been like that.\u201d\n\nBefore she stumbled into the music scene, Landry had been a teacher for over 20 years, though she took the path less traveled.\n\nWhen she first started college she followed in her father\u2019s footsteps and studied education. However, after he convinced her to switch degrees, two months in she dropped out to get a job and a car.\n\nHer parents were horrified. She didn\u2019t want to waste their money but they told her no one ever goes back to college after dropping out. But she was different. Seven years later, she quit her oil field job and went back in school.\n\n\u201cAll those things you\u2019ve failed at or didn\u2019t like, they\u2019re not failure they\u2019re knowledge,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is currently still teaching, with homeschooling during the day and American Sign Language classes at University of Louisiana Lafayette in the evening. After 10 years in Lafayette Parish School district and 13 years at Episcopal School of Acadiana she switched gears again.\n\n\u201cSame thing with being a musician, if you were to ask me if I was ever going to be an author, I\u2019d look at you and tell you \u2018Are you out of your mind? No I can\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nBut here she is, working on her third book with swamp pop pioneer Warren Storm.\n\nHer first book, \u201cThe Ghost Tree,\u201d nominated for Louisiana\u2019s Young Reader\u2019s Choice Award, came about in a moment of desperation as a friends kid begged for a story.\n\nHer second novel, \u201cMadame Grand Doigt,\u201d was pulled from her childhood. She had recently moved into her grandmother\u2019s house and was reminiscing on stories she was told as a kid, especially the scary ones used to convince her to go to bed on time.\n\nWhen she first moved into her grandmother\u2019s house, she hung up pictures of the family bands.\n\n\u201cI was just starting out in music and I had a party there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all these musicians came and they were jamming on the porch, and jamming in the front room, and jamming in the bathroom, and just jamming everywhere.\n\nAnd I remember at one point just stepping back and thinking I bet that this happened in this house before with them. And I know that they\u2019re here with me, watching this. It just feels good.\u201d\n\nMost of the songs Landry has written were done on the front porch of that home. In 2009, she wrote her first song. After she wrote the first song, 17 more came to her in a month. Her dad, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2004, was huge fan, listed to every song she wrote, and encouraged her to make a record.\n\nShe would tell him she wasn\u2019t truly a songwriter but once he passed away in 2009 she knew she had to make a record. Those songs won her \u201cBest Country/Folk Artist\u201d and the album won \u201cBest Country/Folk Album\u201d. Her secret to writing songs now is simple.\n\n\u201cYou just pay attention,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be accepting and open.\u201d\n\nMusic didn\u2019t play a large part in Landry\u2019s life growing up. She preferred sports and didn\u2019t like classical music or wind instruments. After high school, she immediately quit band.\n\nBut she comes from a long lineage of music. Both of her dad\u2019s parents come from families of musicians. In fact, each family had its own band.\n\n\u201cAt some point in the 1920s, those two bands merged and my grandfather met my grandmother and they played music together till they got married and started having babies.\u201d\n\nHer father\u2019s grandmother\u2019s family can be traced back seven or eight generations to the first Hebert to come from Nova Scotia who played the violin.\n\nDespite all the recognition over the years, Landry was still shocked when musician and music promoter Mike Shepherd called to ask if she would accept being inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cYvette is really a great talent,\u201d Shepherd says. \u201cAnd she plays a little bit of bass, accordion and guitar. She writes, she sings and she writes books now. We don\u2019t have enough female artists in this state, and Yvette is a good one.\u201d\n\nShe had to call him the next day to accept, and serendipity took hold after that. Shepherd suggested they induct her at Festival Acadiens, one of the first festivals she played, and this year the festival is commemorating the role of women in Cajun and Creole music. She is also coming up on a decade since her debut album, \u201cShould Have Known\u201d, was released in 2010.\n\n\u201cThis whole journey has not been scripted by me,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how crazy it was \u2026 I\u2019ve always said yes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Advertiser, http://www.theadvertiser.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Like any good Cajun story, this one starts at a zydeco jam.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Victoria Dodge", "Lafayette Daily Advertiser"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/exchange_hall_of_fame_music_59685_c0-45-540-360_s1200x700.jpg?43c4dd5db4ce9e16d23625f20ab32140e290fb03", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
