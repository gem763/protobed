He said exposure to heavy metals hinders early childhood development, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made headway in reducing the levels of arsenic and lead in foods.\n\nTEACHER BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AFTER HUNGRY STUDENT ASKS HER FOR SPAGHETTIOS\n\nBuying organic or choosing to make your own baby food will not prevent exposing your child to the harmful ingredients either, the researchers warned, as heavy metals are naturally occurring in soil and water and are found at elevated levels in fields polluted by pesticides, contaminated with fertilizers or other contaminants.\n\n\"It's a problem that's very hard to get rid of,\" said Siegel, stressing that parents should not be fearful based on these findings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the study, researchers looked at 61 brands and found that 88 percent of foods tested lacked any federal standards or guidance on maximum safe levels of toxic heavy metals like arsenic and lead.\n\nPuff snacks and other rice-based foods like infant cereal were among the highest levels, with researchers claiming to find \u201cno evidence to suggest that any brand has reduced heavy metals levels in rice to amounts comparable to those in other types of grains, despite at least 10 years of significant public attention to the issue that has included widespread consumer alerts and a proposed federal action level.\u201d\n\nThe findings prompted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to call for immediate action, alleging the FDA is \"sitting on its hands.\" Siegel said Schumer is \"grandstanding\" and said the FDA has been able to reduce the amount of arsenic in juices by 75 percent and by 35 percent in cereals.\n\nFox News' Alexandria Hein contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News contributor\u00a0Dr. Marc Siegel said parents must pay close attention after a study on popular\u00a0baby foods\u00a0in the U.S. turned out alarming results, with researchers reporting that 95 percent of products tested contained\u00a0toxic ingredients, including arsenic and lead.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/siegelfood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
