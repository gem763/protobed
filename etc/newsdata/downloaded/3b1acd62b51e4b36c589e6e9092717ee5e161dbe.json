Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was handling the process did not just lend itself to transparency for the public but members of Congress as well.\n\n\u201cI think it needs to be a transparent process,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cYou know, I have long expressed my concern about going through impeachment proceedings in a very, very partisan way because it will only further tear apart an already divided country. My interest and concern is for the well-being of our country and our democracy as we move forward. I think there are areas of concern that were raised around the conversations that happened between Trump and the Ukrainian President, which is why I supported the inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that inquiry needs to be done in a very narrowly focused way, and it must be done transparently,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in those closed doors. We, as members of Congress, don\u2019t have access to the information that is being shared. And I think that the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what the evidence is that\u2019s being presented as this inquiry goes on.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Thursday on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity,\" Rep.
