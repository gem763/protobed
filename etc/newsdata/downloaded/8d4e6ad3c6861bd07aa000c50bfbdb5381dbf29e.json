Ever heard of quality assurance?? Disgusting.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News)\n\n\"It's vile, I've never come across anything so gross.\n\n\"I feel grim knowing they've been near me.\n\n\"Honestly thought I was gonna be sick when I realised, I was on the verge of tears.\n\n\"It's horrible because someone's obviously returned a package with these in and the return's not been checked properly.\n\n\"It's been repackaged without the sh*t stains being noticed and then sent it back out?\n\n\"Makes you question if they check anything at all if this can get through.\n\n\"I wanted to burn everything [I] couldn't believe I'd taken them out of the packaging. Had to have a shower cos I felt like I was contaminated or something.\n\n\"They clearly don't give one about health and safety.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News)\n\nAfter posting about it on September 12, Fiona from the Boohoo social media team responded two days later inviting her to DM them with further details.\n\nReplying to revolted social media users, Emily revealed that she'd received no explanation as to how the soiled thong from a different brand got in there.\n\nEmily tweeted: \"They're insisting to me that they don't take returns on underwear but other than if a worker put them in then it has to be some dutty return.\n\n\"I've got a refund and was offered a \u00a35 voucher which I never received (not that I need it now anyway lol) and got no explanation at all tbh, pretty much just been brushed off by them.\n\n\"There's no chance of an explanation - they're 'looking into it' which translates to 'we'll pretend we will do something about it so that you'll leave us alone'.\"\n\nBoohoo have been approached for comment.", "description": "Emily Green was left on the verge of tears after she claims she found something unspeakable on the inside of a pair of Primark pants after she received an order from Boohoo", "authors": ["Helen Le Caplain", "Image", "Kennedy News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558481.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Pic-from-Facebook-copyright-unknown-use-at-own-risk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
