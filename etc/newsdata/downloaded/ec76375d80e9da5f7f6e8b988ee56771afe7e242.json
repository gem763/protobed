But he still has a chance to deliver his pledge to get Britain out of the EU by the end of the month. A Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be put before parliament next week, and it could begin its journey into law as soon as Tuesday.\n\nThe question then will be, as it was on Saturday morning, whether Johnson has the votes to push it through. The day saw Conservative MPs, both current and almost all those he expelled last month, saying they\u2019d vote with him, as well as a small number of Labour MPs. If he can hold that coalition together for two weeks, he might have a chance.\n\nIf he fails, the country will be plunged into an unprecedented political crisis. The possible outcomes range from delaying Brexit - allowing time for a general election or a second referendum on leaving - to a chaotic and economically damaging departure from the bloc without a deal in just 12 days\u2019 time.\n\nIf Johnson tries to circumvent the legislation forcing him to seek a delay, as his aides have previously threatened, he is almost certain to face legal challenges that could end up in the UK Supreme Court.\n\nThat makes it likely he will ask for an extension, something that would require the unanimous agreement of EU leaders.\n\n???????? @EU_Commission takes note of the vote in the House of Commons today on the so-called #Letwin Amendment meaning that the #WithdrawalAgreement itself was not put to vote today. It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible. \u2014 Mina Andreeva (@Mina_Andreeva) October 19, 2019\n\nOn Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said one shouldn\u2019t be granted. But EU officials say that despite Macron, who made similar noises before approving a Brexit delay in April, it\u2019s unlikely that he or any other leader would refuse another one, particularly if the U.K. was headed for a general election.\n\nIf attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit fail, the consequences for Britain are likely to be severe. According to the government\u2019s own analysis, a chaotic no-deal Brexit would cause disruption to trade, financial services, and food supplies, and risk civil disorder.", "description": "At a rare Saturday sitting, members of parliament voted to delay a decision on the agreement Johnson reached in Brussels.", "authors": ["Robert Hutton", "Kitty Donaldson"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8346/498b28104fe24448a4456614e037b872.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
