A value of 0 would mean perfect equality.\n\nIn particular, income inequality rose markedly in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have made economic inequality the centerpiece of their campaigns, with both proposing a tax on the wealth of the richest Americans.\n\nStill, median household income is rising. It reached $61,937 in 2018, only the second year since the 2008 financial crisis that that figure has exceeded income levels prior to the crisis.\n\nWages have been growing above 3 percent since late 2018, while the inflation rate has stayed below 2 percent.\n\nThe percentage of Americans with incomes below the poverty level also dropped for the fifth consecutive year, declining to 13.1 percent in 2018 from 13.4 percent the year before.\n\n\u201cThis is the story of a tight labor market, where more people have jobs and workers at the middle and bottom have enough bargaining power to get real wage gains,\u201d Baker said. \u201cLong and short, I see this as a mostly positive story \u2014 with the important qualification that we have a very long way to go to get to a situation where workers at the middle and bottom have a fair share of output.\u201d", "description": "Income inequality has reached its highest level in at least 50 years, according to new U.S. government data released today, underscoring a key theme for Democratic candidates hoping to unseat President Donald Trump.
