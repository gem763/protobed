In Annapolis, floodwaters disrupted the United States Sailboat Show and some roads were closed.\n\nTidal flooding in Annapolis today was nuts! This was about 45 minutes after the evening high tide.

High water, about two feet above normal, is a particular concern at high tide. Here are upcoming high tides at select locations:\n\nThe high water along the Tidal Potomac and Chesapeake Bay is partly in response to departing Tropical Storm Melissa. When Melissa meandered close to coastal New England on Wednesday and Thursday, winds from the north on its backside pushed water in the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay south, away from Washington and Baltimore. But since the storm has retreated to the east and those winds have relaxed, the water (previously displaced) is sloshing back up the river and bay.\n\nMaking matters worse, the moon is nearing its full phase, which it reaches Sunday, elevating tidal levels. This month\u2019s full moon, called the Hunter\u2019s Moon, is officially full at 5:07 p.m. eastern Sunday.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the offshore storm and the moon contributing to these anomalous tides. The frequency of high tide flooding in the Mid-Atlantic has increased dramatically in recent decades due to sea level rise.\n\n\n\nAnnual number of high-tide floods per year in Mid-Atlantic over time.\n\nA 2018 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed that in 15 years, the incidence of high-tide flooding in the Mid-Atlantic doubled, from an average of three days per year in 2000 to six in 2015.\n\nGiven sea level rise projections, high-tide flooding could occur every other day by the end of the century, the NOAA report said.\n\nBelow find pictures of some of the flooding...\n\nPhotos\n\nPotomac\n\nScenes from flooding in Old Town Alexandria pic.twitter.com/OqKo2hhohU \u2014 Darcy Spencer (@darcyspencer) October 13, 2019\n\nOld town at 7:13pm.
