The Taliban, an Islamic militant group in Afghanistan, recently reiterated its support for the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump ultimately made the decision,\u201d Pompeo said of the Camp David invite. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to talk to [Afghan President Ashraf Ghani], I want to talk to these Taliban negotiators, I want to look them in the eye.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of bad folks have come through that place,\u201d he added, referring to Camp David. \u201cThere\u2019s been lots of peace negotiations taking place. It\u2019s almost always the case that you don\u2019t get to negotiate with good guys.\u201d\n\nChris Wallace asks Secretary of State Mike Pompeo why President Trump planned to meet with Taliban leaders three days before 9/11. #FNS #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/BKXdElTqUy \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 8, 2019\n\nThe president on Saturday announced that peace negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban were on hold indefinitely after the group claimed responsibility for a car bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people, including a U.S. soldier, last week.\n\nTrump said in a series of tweets that he had secretly invited Taliban leaders to meet with him at Camp David, but that he had canceled the meeting after the group \u201cadmitted\u201d to carrying out the attack.\n\nThe invitation drew backlash from Democrats and some members of the media.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban had the deaths of thousands of Americans, and it\u2019s just three days before 9/11. No concerns about that?\u201d Wallace asked Pompeo on Sunday. \u201cI can understand the envoy talking to them \u2015 why does the president have to confer that status on them?\u201d\n\nPompeo claimed Trump was \u201cvery clear\u201d about wanting to make sure negotiations with the Taliban \u201cgot to the right place.\u201d\n\nTrump is \u201cwilling to take risks if he believes he can deliver a good outcome for the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we get it right.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nLambasting Pompeo, North Korea Says Hopes For U.S. Talks Are 'Fading'\n\nPalestinian Harvard Student Arrives On Campus After Initially Denied Entry Into U.S.\n\nTrump Says He Secretly Invited Taliban Leaders, Afghanistan President To U.S.\n\nLove HuffPost?
