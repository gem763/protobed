They\u2019ll now play a decisive Game 5 back in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\nZimmerman\u2019s clutch homer paved the way for Washington starter Max Scherzer, who overcame a shaky start and threw up zeros the rest of the way. At one point, he retired 12 of 13 batters and finished with seven strikeouts in seven innings.\n\nGame Ball\n\nThe moment may have belonged to Zimmerman, but Scherzer did exactly what the Nationals needed him to do \u2013 supply length and throw effectively enough to make sure an all-hands-on-deck situation from the bullpen could wait another day.\n\nIt was clear the three-time Cy Young Award winner didn\u2019t have his best stuff in the early going, with two of the first five Dodgers hitting extra-base hits, but that quickly changed. He tamed the formidable Dodgers lineup through the middle innings and allowed four hits and three walks total. Scherzer punctuated his outing by escaping a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the seventh to keep the Nationals up by five.\n\nTurning point\n\nWith the game tied 1-1, Turner led off the fifth with a single and Adam Eaton moved him to second on a sac bunt. Anthony Rendon, who'd driven in the first Nationals run with a sacrifice fly in the third, blooped one into left field for the Nationals\u2019 first lead of the game. Howie Kendrick lined a knock into left-center to set up first and third, which brought Zimmerman to the dish.\n\nBaez tried to challenge him upstairs with an 0-1 fastball. Zimmerman wasn\u2019t caught by surprise, and he sent the ball 414 feet to dead center.\n\nSeeing things out\n\nThe Nationals tacked on another run in the sixth when Turner led off with a double and Rendon plated him with a sacrifice fly to center that sent Bellinger crashing into the wall.\n\nThe bottom of Los Angeles' order loaded the bases against Scherzer with one out in the seventh. He fanned pinch-hitter Chris Taylor and when Joc Pederson pounded his 109th pitch of the night into the ground toward second base for the third out, the 35-year-old was visibly pumped while strolling off the mound.\n\nThere were no bullpen theatrics from the Nationals in this one. Sean Doolittle retired all four hitters he faced and Daniel Hudson shut the door with the final two outs in the ninth.\n\nState of the series\n\nAll that's at stake in Game 5 is a berth to the NLCS. For the Dodgers, it'd mark the fourth consecutive season they advance to that round. The Nationals franchise (even as the Expos) has never won a playoff series.\n\nThe pitching matchup features right-hander Walker Buehler for the Dodgers and Stephen Strasburg for the Nationals. Buehler was lights out in the opening contest of the series, throwing six one-hit frames with eight strikeouts. Strasburg was almost as good the next night (one run allowed) and fanned 10 over six innings in a Game 2 win.", "description": "The Washington Nationals even the series with the Dodgers after a gutsy performance from Max Scherzer in Game 4.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/08/USAT/93247053-ee5b-4b2f-84e5-b799aa8f9e24-USATSI_13478007.jpg?crop=2097,1180,x292,y59&width=1770&height=1180&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
