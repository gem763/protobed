Perhaps that\u2019s why AI has such an impact on our imagination, and why, in recent years, there\u2019s been so much hype surrounding the technology.\n\nBut AI is not a myth, nor is it a magical machine. It\u2019s a technology like any other, that, after decades of research, has reached a new plateau of productivity. Cheap processing power and abundant data have made this possible, and AI and machine learning are now useful tools in a diverse range of fields, including astronomy, health care, transportation, and music.\n\nAfter years of promise, AI is finally becoming useful\n\nAfter years of promise, AI is finally becoming useful. But what usually happens to useful technologies is that they disappear. We forget about the things that just work, and we shouldn\u2019t let that happen to AI. Any technology destined to change the world needs scrutiny, and AI, with its combination of huge imaginative presence and very real, very dangerous failings, needs that scrutiny more than most.\n\nSo, for the AI Issue at The Verge, we\u2019re taking a closer look at some of the ways artificial intelligence and machine learning are affecting technology right now \u2014 because it\u2019s too late to understand something after it\u2019s changed the world.", "description": "For The AI Issue at The Verge, we\u2019re taking a closer look at the ways that artificial intelligence and machine learning are affecting technology right now.
