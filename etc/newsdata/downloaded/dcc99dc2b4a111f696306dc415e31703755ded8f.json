Ocasio-Cortez cohorts in stupidity who are running for office support this notion, which takes God out of the equation (as if they know God\u2019s plan for the human race).

The dead satellites and debris alone are estimated at numbering over 500,000 pieces and must be removed. The fact that numerous new satellites are launched every year by various countries is another concern. How does all of this affect the environment?\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 supposed front-runner for president in 2020, Joe Biden, has brought making gaffes to an all-time new level of idiocy. The fact that he had two brain aneurysms back in 1988 might have something to do with his state of mind theses days. God forbid the court jester ever gets elected because then the world really would come to an end.\n\nGREGORY J.
