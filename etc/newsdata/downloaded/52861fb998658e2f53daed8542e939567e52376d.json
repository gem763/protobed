Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NFL\u2019s all-time leader in passing yards has been sidelined since tearing a ligament in his right thumb in a Week 2 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Sept. 15.\n\nBrees, 40, was a limited participant in practice this week and was listed as questionable on the Saints\u2019 injury report.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater went 5-0 as the starter after replacing Brees, completing 67.7 percent of his passes for 1,370 yards with nine touchdowns and two interceptions this season.\n\n\u2014Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, on the other hand, will miss his team\u2019s game Sunday, snapping a decade-long streak of 154 consecutive starts.\n\nVeteran Matt Schaub will start under center when the Falcons (1-6) host the Seattle Seahawks (5-2). Danny Etling was promoted from the practice squad to back up Schaub.\n\nRyan, 34, sustained the injury in last Sunday\u2019s loss to the Rams. The 2016 NFL Most Valuable Player has started every game for Atlanta since Dec. 20, 2009 and is tied for the NFL lead with 15 touchdown passes.\n\n\u2014The New York Jets cut veteran guard Kelechi Osemele amidst a month-long injury dispute.\n\nThe news followed a report by ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter earlier Saturday that Osemele and the NFL Players Association were considering specific action against a team doctor after it was revealed that damage to Osemele\u2019s torn labrum was more extensive than first thought. Osemele had surgery Friday against the Jets wishes.\n\nThe Jets doubted the severity of the injury and team physicians cleared Osemele, who has not played since Week 3. The team wanted him to play through the injury and have surgery after the season. New York has fined him since last Saturday for conduct detrimental to the team for each day he missed practice.\n\n\u2014The Los Angeles Chargers activated left tackle Russell Okung, officially clearing the way for the veteran to make his 2019 debut. In a corresponding move, the team placed rookie safety Nasir Adderley on injured reserve.\n\nOkung, the anchor of an offensive line decimated by injuries, has been sidelined since June after suffering a pulmonary embolism because of blood clots and was placed on the non-football injury list.\n\n\u2014Wide receiver Josh Gordon is expected to be ready to come off injured reserve within two weeks, at which point the New England Patriots will release him, ESPN reported.\n\nIf he is released after the trade deadline on Tuesday, Gordon would be placed on waivers and could be claimed by another team and play right away.\n\nGordon, 28, had been battling bone bruises in his left knee, then sustained further injury on Oct. 10 against the New York Giants. He did not play Monday night against the New York Jets, and the Patriots acquired Mohamed Sanu from the Atlanta Falcons for a second-round draft pick on Tuesday.\n\n\u2014Former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski hinted at a possible return to the NFL while representing a CBD company at a press conference on Friday.\n\nThough he said earlier this month on WEEI radio that he would not be returning, he seemed to crack the door during the event announcing a partnership between CBD Medic and Gillette Stadium and Patriot Place, reportedly stating, \u201cI also want to have the option to get back into the game, and if I\u2019m banned next year (for using CBD) I can\u2019t.\n\n\u2014The Tampa Bay Buccaneers activated defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul and expect him to make his season debut against the Tennessee Titans after injuring his neck in an offseason car wreck.\n\nThe Buccaneers have the lowest-ranked pass defense in the NFL, and Pierre-Paul\u2019s production \u2014 he led the team with 12.5 sacks last season \u2014 could be a boost for the beleaguered unit.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Quarterback Drew Brees will start on Sunday when the New Orleans Saints host the Arizona Cardinals, multiple outlets reported Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445352064&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q017-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
