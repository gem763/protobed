Turkish forces invaded northern Syria after Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the region a few weeks ago and several ISIS supporters were reported to have escaped from a Syrian camp. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo managed to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week and agreed to a temporary ceasefire. On Wednesday, Trump said the two sides have agreed to a lasting ceasefire. As a result, he'll lift the economic sanctions on Turkey that he enacted a couple of weeks ago.\n\nTurkey told the U.S. that it will be stopping combat in the region, Trump said at the White House. The ceasefire, he added, will be \u201cpermanent.\u201d A small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area to protect the oil.\n\n\u201cEarly this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria and making the ceasefire permanent.\u201d - @realDonaldTrumppic.twitter.com/IM8A06I0qT \u2014 Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) October 23, 2019\n\nThe U.S.'s actions, Trump added, will provide a peaceful area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20-mile wide safe zone. As for ISIS fighters who escaped, Trump said they have been largely \"recaptured.\"\n\n\"Let someone else fight over this blood stained sand,\" the president added.\n\nU.S. troops will only be deployed, he said, when \"a vital national interest is at stake.\"\n\nRussia and Turkey reached their own agreement on Tuesday, calling for the withdrawal of Syrian Kurdish forces from the Turkish border and joint military patrols of the area.\n\nBefore his White House remarks, Trump wrote on Twitter that the agreements had been successful.\n\nBig success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans blasted Trump's decision to take troops out of Syria, because it was viewed as abandoning our Kurdish allies.\n\n\"We have left them to the wolves,\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The message this is sending to our allies around the world I think is really going to be bad.\"\n\nShould Turkey fail to honor their end of the agreement, Trump said he reserves the right to reimpose sanctions.", "description": ".10/23/2019 12:34:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ae45da6a-b461-4e5b-a13e-6ed2ef1761a4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
