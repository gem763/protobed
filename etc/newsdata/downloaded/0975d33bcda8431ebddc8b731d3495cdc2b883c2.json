No\u2014he was cornered by the greatest toughest best military heroes on earth!! How about we killed the evil SOB,' Hannity tweeted.\n\n'This is exactly why America will never trust these mainstream corrupt fake news outlets ever again.'\n\nHannity went on to tweet, 'Let me educate the Washington Post. Al-Baghdadi was the leader of ISIS... The terror organization that is responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of people. ISIS terrorists take pleasure in beheadings and burning people alive in cages. They use cars and trucks to mow down innocent people. To describe Al-Baghdadi as an \"austere religious scholar\" is sick and repulsive.'\n\nPresident Trump announced Sunday morning that al-Baghdadi 'died like a dog' as the result of an overnight U.S. Special Ops forces raid on his hideout in northwest Syria.\n\nHannity sent out three tweets in total about the Washington Post headline Sunday\n\nThe Washington Post called al-Baghdadid a 'terrorist-in-chief' when it tweeted out the obituary\n\nThe Washington Post revised the obituary headline, claiming they 'changed it quickly'\n\nTrump said that al-Baghdadi killed himself and three children when he detonated his suicide vest after being cornered in a dead-end tunnel.\n\nThe headline that offended Hannity appears to have been based on the line from the obituary stating that 'When Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took the reins of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, few had heard of the organization or its new leader, then an austere religious scholar with wire-frame glasses and no known aptitude for fighting and killing.'\n\nThe obituary also went on to note that al-Baghdadi 'spent his early adult years as an obscure academic, aiming for a quiet life as a professor of Islamic law.'\n\nA Washington Post spokesperson told Fox News that 'Regarding our al-Baghdadi obituary, the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly.'\n\nWhen the newspaper tweeted out the obituary, the tweet called al-Baghdadi 'Islamic State's \"terrorist-in-chief.\"'", "description": "Sean Hannity fired off a tweets blasting the newspaper for headlining the dead ISIS leader's obituary: 'Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (inset), austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48.'", "authors": ["Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/02/20263620-0-image-a-86_1572228151922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
