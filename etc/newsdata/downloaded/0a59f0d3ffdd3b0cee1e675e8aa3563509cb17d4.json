There\u2019s no-one in the squad who\u2019s just happy to be in the squad.\n\n\"Everyone wants to play, everyone wants to be in the starting 11 and will be disappointed when they\u2019re not starting.\n\n\u201cSo, we have a team of 24, 23 players and everyone wants to play and challenge each other. I think that\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve got a team with the right mentality who want to do well.\n\n\"It\u2019s not just the starting 11, it\u2019s the players competing for positions.\u201d", "description": "The Manchester City flier is adamant the Three Lions are ready to end their 54-year major tournament drought", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Getty Images", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555492.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
