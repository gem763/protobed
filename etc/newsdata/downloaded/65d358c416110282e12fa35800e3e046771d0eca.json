First it's [Ronald] Reagan and now it's the pope,\" one woman said, referring to a separate incident that had seen the U.S. president shot just weeks before Pope John Paul II was attacked.\n\nMany had the same core question \u2014 how could this happen?\n\n\"What is happening in the world today for something like that to happen?\" asked a woman who appeared to be upset by the news. \"It's a shock to everybody and I hope that he do pull through.\"\n\n'I didn't realize it was a bullet'\n\nThis photo shows Pope John Paul II sitting in his bed at the Policlinico Gemelli hospital in Rome on May 19, 1981, six days after he was wounded in St. Peter's Square.

She did not even initially realize that she had been shot.\n\n\"I knew something entered my body, but I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" Odre said, when later recalling the events of that day on CBC's Front Page Challenge in October of the following year.\n\nOdre told the game show that she had been standing on a chair when she was struck. She sat down on the ground and waited for help.\n\nEventually, she was carried away on a stretcher, as it was too crowded in the square for an ambulance to get to her.\n\nOdre remained in hospital in Rome for weeks, until she returned to the United States in July 1981 and spent further time in a Buffalo hospital.\n\nShe would return to Rome in August of 1982, returning to the papal audience in St. Peter's Square and having occasion to speak directly to the pope.\n\n'Why was it me?'\n\nIn this April 10, 2014 photo, Sister Marisa from the Daughters of Charity closes the altar where the bloodstained undershirt worn by Pope John Paul II during the assassination attempt is kept, in Rome.

But he said it in Polish, because I do talk in the Polish language.\"\n\nOdre told Front Page Challenge the incident left her unable to work, in part due to the stress of what she had been through.\n\nShe also kept thinking about a haunting question, nearly a year and a half after the shooting.\n\n\"I keep asking, why was it me?\" said Odre.\n\nAgca, the man who shot the pope, was handed a life sentence. He spent nearly two decades in an Italian prison before being extradited to Turkey where he spent further time behind bars.\n\nHis motivation for the shooting has never been completely clear.", "description": "An American woman's trip of a lifetime turned into one that nearly claimed her life, as she was caught in the crossfire when a man tried to kill Pope John Paul II.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5271552.1567696597!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/pope-john-paul-ii-seen-recovering-in-hospital-in-may-1981.jpg"}
