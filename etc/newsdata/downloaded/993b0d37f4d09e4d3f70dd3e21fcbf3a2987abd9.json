Wages are rising for low-income workers \u2014 thanks to a growing economy and stricter migration policies. Tax cuts have made investment in the U.S. an attractive prospect again, after years of offshoring by American companies.\n\nTrump took the economic fight to China, as promised, pushing back against the communist regime\u2019s exploitative trade practices for the first time. He destroyed the so-called ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d \u2014 even though critics are upset at the way in which he is now leaving Syria. He also renewed traditional U.S. alliances \u2014 especially with Israel, where he moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. He left international agreements that conservatives long believed were damaging to U.S. interests, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nHe has appointed over 180 new federal judges to the bench \u2014 an achievement that could entrench constitutional conservatism for a generation.\n\nTrump has also begun building the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 albeit over the objections of Congress and left-wing groups that have taken their \u201cresistance\u201d to the courts. Mexico has not written a check to the U.S. Treasury \u2014 but it is now spending its own money to deploy thousands of troops to its southern border to intercept migrant caravans.\n\nOther administration goals remain works in progress. Though the Trump administration has reduced the cost of health insurance and prescription drugs, Republicans in Congress failed to repeal and replace Obamacare. Trump has begun a process of negotiation with North Korea, but has yet to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. He has begun to reverse the tide of the opioid epidemic, but much remains to be done.\n\nTrump has not begun to tackle persistent deficit spending, nor has he been able to convince Democrats to work with him on upgrading national infrastructure. Indeed, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement \u2014 one of his most important economic achievements \u2014 is currently languishing in the Democrat-run House.\n\nMoreover, Trump faces an effort by Democrats to impeach him for non-crimes through a secret process that seems aimed more at affecting the 2020 election than actually removing him from office.\n\nStill, he has lasted longer than many of his detractors said he would. He has guided a healthy economy and a revival of the middle class in peaceful circumstances. As he faces a field of Democratic rivals stampeding to the left, he is confident.\n\nJoel B.
