It\u2019s Lord Sugar not Sir Alan, and the prize is \u00a3250,000 for a 50 per cent stake in your business, not a job.\n\nBut the biggest change is the audience\u2019s reaction, as Lottie Lion found out this week, when she received death threats and cruel trolling for clashing with other women on her team.\n\nTeenager Lottie says she knew she was going to be projected into the limelight. It is a big show with lots of water cooler moments.\n\nWhile my tasks were always in London, this lucky lot were sent to South Africa to organise a tour. A simple selling task \u2013 negotiate, buy, sell and make a profit.\n\nBut as the episode went on to reveal, it doesn\u2019t matter where you put a bunch of big egos, they will stay true to form.\n\nAnd it was the women I felt most let down by, probably because I expected more.\n\nWhat is wrong with these millennials? They look the part \u2013 make-up, nail extensions and high-powered suits \u2013 but jeez, they were dull.\n\nNot Lottie the librarian, at least. I was 32 when I was runner-up on the show. Lottie is just 19 \u2013 and smashing the librarian \u00adstereotypes.\n\nShe created some spark on the women\u2019s team. And there was (dare I say it) a hint of former Apprentice Katie Hopkins.\n\nAlthough, like Katie, she needs to learn when to listen \u2013 especially when the experts are talking.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nYou do need a sense of chutzpah and confidence to run your own business. But what I saw from the rest was depressing.\n\nIt took four of them to pluck up the courage to sell a cut-price ticket to their luxury wine tour. I\u2019d have fired them for the totally impractical high heels alone.\n\nThey were not all working towards a shared goal, which was to beat the boys.\n\nYou do that by pulling together \u2013 you watch each other\u2019s backs, not stab them at every opportunity.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBeing aggressive, dominant, boastful and trying to benefit from your teammates\u2019 failings is not the way to be a good leader in business.\n\nYou have to work hard and be informed, not moan and do a job half-cocked.\n\nIt made me want to ring Lord Sugar and ask if I could have another go. I may be nearly 50 but I\u2019d give them a good run for their money.\n\nTV is all about engagement. But while I yelled at my screen, I wouldn\u2019t dream of firing off death threats.\n\nHowever it seems some idiot viewers see these candidates as villains. And now they have the easy means to attack, sending vile messages before the credits have even rolled.\n\nLord Sugar and his boardroom henchmen should be the scariest thing on The \u00adApprentice. Not the viewers.", "description": "It's been fourteen years since Saira appeared on The Apprentice - and back then the scariest part of the process was Lord Sugar, not the trolls watching at home", "authors": ["Saira Khan", "Image", "Bbc", "Itv Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20468162.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_saira-khan-apprentice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
