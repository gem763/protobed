Over the course of a year that\u2019s equal to around 64 TWh or terawatt hours of energy consumption. That\u2019s more than the country of Switzerland uses over the same time period (58 TWh per year), but less than Colombia (68 TWh per year).\n\nIt means Bitcoin accounts for roughly 0.25 percent of the world\u2019s entire electricity consumption. That\u2019s as much energy as all the tea kettles in the UK use over 11 years. It also means that the electricity wasted each year by always-on but inactive electronic devices in the US could power the Bitcoin network four times over.\n\n\u201cWe want to use comparisons that set the narrative,\u201d one of the co-creators of the CBECI, Michel Rauchs, told BBC News. \u201dVisitors to the website can make up their own mind as to whether it seems large or small.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s well established that Bitcoin requires a huge amount of electricity, used by miners around the world running the computer hardware necessary to maintain the network and validate payments. But it\u2019s also worth remembering these figures are very much estimates.\n\n\u201cReliable estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s electricity usage are rare\u201d\n\nIn a blog post announcing the new index, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which oversaw the work, makes the same observation. \u201cReliable estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s electricity usage are rare: in most cases, they only provide a one-time snapshot and the numbers often show substantial discrepancies from one model to another,\u201d it says.\n\nThis uncertainty is reflected by the CBECI\u2019s inclusion of lower and upper bounds for its estimates. The lower bound is currently around 22 TWh while the upper bound is just under 150 TWh. (Though these figures may have changed since the time of publication).\n\nIt\u2019s a significant spread, and it suggests that exact comparisons between different estimates should be taken with a pinch of salt. Another popular estimate of the cryptocurrency\u2019s energy usage maintained by Digiconomist pegs the network\u2019s yearly consumption at 70 TWh, for example \u2014 six TWh greater than the University of Cambridge\u2019s CBECI. You can read more about the exact methodology used to calculate the CBECI here.\n\nRegardless of the exact figures, the energy usage of Bitcoin is certainly eyebrow raising. It\u2019s increased rapidly, sometimes doubling in less than six months, and this sort of energy usages comes with a significant carbon footprint. Though, again, exact estimates of this environmental impact vary significantly because of the difficulty of determining how the electricity used to power Bitcoin\u2019s mining hardware is generated.\n\nThe cryptocurrency also looks unwieldy in terms of day to day utility. Alex de Vries, a Bitcoin expert at PwC, told BBC News that the network processes fewer than 100 million transactions per year, a \u201ccompletely insignificant\u201d figure compared to the 500 billion payments processed by the traditional financial industry. de Vries estimates that Bitcoin uses more energy per transaction than all the rest of the world\u2019s banks combined.", "description": "Bitcoin consumes more energy than the entire nation of Switzerland, according to new estimates published by researchers at the University of Cambridge.
