Growing up, I rooted for the Minnesota Timberwolves. I was there for the ups \u2014 who can forget that almost magical 2004 season? \u2014 and all of the downs, of which there have been far too many. I still follow the team closely today.\n\nSo as a fan of the league, I was shocked when I found myself being censored at an NBA exhibition game Wednesday night in Washington between the Washington Wizards and the Guangzhou Loong Lions. Now, I\u2019m rethinking my allegiance to the league and wondering whether I should stop attending or even watching games altogether.\n\nI decided to attend last night\u2019s game after reading about an incident that took place at a Philadelphia 76ers game this week. In Philly, security guards ejected two spectators for displaying small signs with messages of support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy dissidents.\n\nIt was an unsettling sight: One of America\u2019s premier sports leagues, which constantly virtue-signals about its \u201cvalues,\u201d groveling to a totalitarian regime and censoring its own fans in the United States of America \u2014 in Philly, home of the Constitutional Convention and the Liberty Bell.\n\nI knew I had to do something. I wanted to test for myself whether the NBA would be so brazen as to censor fans again \u2014 this time in our nation\u2019s capital, no less.\n\nMy friends and I entered Capital One Arena donning \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d T-shirts given to us by an activist outside the arena and with homemade signs concealed in our clothes. We took our seats shortly before the Chinese national anthem began to play.\n\nAt that point, we stood up and unfurled a long \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d banner. That immediately attracted the attention of several security guards, who came over to confiscate our sign. We asked why we were having our sign taken away. We were told: \u201cWe respect your freedom of speech, but \u2026 we don\u2019t have any stance on [Hong Kong]. So we\u2019re just asking not to have any signage related to that in here tonight.\u201d\n\nLater, we unveiled a second message, a homemade sign that simply said \u201cGoogle Uyghurs,\u201d referring to China\u2019s oppressed Muslims, more than a million of whom are believed to be kept in re-education camps.\n\nThis sign, too, was deemed to be a problem. Within minutes, we were approached by security supervisors, who told us that we were not allowed to make political statements about China at the game. My friend pleaded that we were simply seeking to educate some of the NBA officials, coaches and players, many of whom had expressed ignorance about the issue. It was in vain: The supervisor still confiscated the sign and told us that if we continued to disrupt the game, we would be ejected.\n\nBy then, we felt we had seen enough and left of our own accord.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s fair to wonder: What values does the NBA really stand for? In recent years, the league has taken pains to exhibit a concern for \u201csocial justice,\u201d with prominent players speaking out in favor of almost exclusively progressive political causes and executives encouraging such activism.\n\nMost notably, in 2016 the NBA used its influence to push a gender ideology and lobby against a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d law in North Carolina that would have protected women in private spaces \u2014 going so far as to move the NBA All-Star game out of Charlotte to New Orleans. Far from avoiding political controversy, the league seemed to embrace it when the targets were American conservatives.\n\nBut the NBA\u2019s courage to speak truth to power dissipates when faced with the power of China\u2019s monstrous Communist regime. When Chairman Xi yanks the NBA\u2019s corporate chain, the league tells its fans: \u201cShut up and watch us dribble.\u201d\n\nThis should be very worrying for all Americans, not just sports fans. If the price of US companies doing business in China involves self-censorship, there should be no sale. Free speech is a bedrock American principle, not some cheap slogan that can be auctioned off to the highest bidder. When Beijing can force the country\u2019s wokest sports league to practice Chinese-style censorship and authoritarianism on American soil, free trade has gone too far.\n\nOur country and the freedoms we enjoy are too important to ignore the league\u2019s craven conduct. Until the NBA apologizes to fans for how it has handled this incident and unequivocally commits to bedrock American values, I will be forgoing my NBA viewership for a pastime which better upholds American values. I encourage my fellow fans to do the same.\n\nJon Schweppe is the director of policy and government affairs at American Principles Project.
