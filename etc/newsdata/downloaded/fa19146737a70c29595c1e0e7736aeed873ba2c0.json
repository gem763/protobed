This week we are introduced to his latest guise of anti-fascist James Bond in an episode that ticks all our favourite Peaky boxes. There is death, destruction and a set-piece involving hand grenades, Catholic-hating gangsters and exploding caravans. Who could want for more?\n\nShelby (Cillian Murphy) obviously doesn\u2019t require a license to kill. Still, he is very much On His Majesty\u2019s Secret Service by the final credits. His cunning plan is to sign up to Oswald Mosley\u2019s new party, the British Union of Fascists, and report from the inside to his resident intelligence contact, Ben Younger (Kingsley Ben-Adir).\n\nHow could a tough Brummie possibly win the trust of the Home County Hitler (Sam Claflin) and his goons? The deeply improbable answer is that Oswald is appreciative of the cut of Tommy\u2019s jib and offers him the position of deputy leader. This is TV show logic at its most blaring (even more blaring than the soundtrack). Then again, who among us has ever watched Peaky Blinders for its realism?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMosley also name-drops his good friend Mussolini. On the heels of the message Tommy received in part one from his old mucker Winston Churchill, it\u2019s tempting to conclude that show runner Steven Knight is determined to reference as many historical figures in as short a time as possible. We look forward to the future instalment in which Tommy embarks on a road trip with Adolf Hitler, Albert Einstein and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 2/26 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.\" BBC 3/26 The Virtues \"Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham\u2019s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\" Dean Rogers/Channel 4 4/26 Good Omens 'Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett\u2019s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.' Amazon Prime 5/26 Line of Duty (BBC) \"Plausibility is a spectrum; Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the individual. The shadowy government forces are elected; the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It\u2019s exhausting work, policing the police.\" BBC 6/26 Our Planet (Netflix) \"The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can\u2019t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.\" Netflix 7/26 Road to Brexit (BBC) \"The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it\u2019s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don\u2019t understand. Rather, it\u2019s a very clever, very funny, very 'different' parcel of bollocks to Brexit.\" BBC 8/26 Fleabag (BBC) \"While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O\u2019Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.\" BBC/Two Brothers/Luke Varley 9/26 Derry Girls (Channel 4) \"It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man\u2019s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.\" Peter Marley 10/26 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC) \"A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando\u2019s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can\u2019t really add anything to that.\" PA 11/26 Home (Channel 4) \"Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme \u2013 but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he\u2019s stray cat that\u2019s just wandered in.\" Channel 4 12/26 Leaving Neverland (Channel 4) \"Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland\u201d AFP/Getty 13/26 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1) \"This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed.

But episode three is so stuffed the central plot felt almost beside the point. There\u2019s an especially distressing scene in which Arthur (Paul Anderson) beats to death the Quaker whom his estranged wife, Linda (Kate Phillips), has taken into her confidence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a peaceful man,\u201d slurs Arthur over the corpse. In the background, Anna Calvi is singing David Bowie. In an hour filled with Very Peaky Blinders moments this is the Peakiest of them all.\n\nSparks are elsewhere flying between Michael\u2019s pregnant wife Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) and hellish mother-in-law Polly (Helen McCrory). A straight-talking American, Gina makes little secret of the fact that she doesn\u2019t intend spending very long in Birmingham.\n\n\u201cMy baby will be born in New York,\u201d she crisply informs the grandmother to be. Polly fixes her with a death glare. Clearly Gina\u2019s plan will not be coming to fruition. The fun will be seeing in how Polly puts manners on her irreverent daughter-in-law.\n\nMeanwhile, the hand-grenades feature in the denouement as the Peakys step up their conflict against the Billy Boys gang in Glasgow. We saw just how nasty these new antagonists were last week when they crucified boxer Bonnie Gold as a warning to Tommy. It turns out that this provocation will be the Billy Boys\u2019s cross to bear as Bonnie\u2019s father, Aberama (Aidan Gillen of the magical wandering accents) sets off on a trail of vengeance.\n\nOld-flame Polly springs Aberama from hospital and helps him on his way to Scotland. Once there, Aberama sends a warning to Billy Boys leader Jimmy McCavern (Brian Gleeson) by pouring hot tar all over the face of one of his bruisers.\n\nMcCavern retaliates by attacking Aberama\u2019s caravans. What he doesn\u2019t know is that Arthur, fresh from his Quaker killing, has gone north and booby-trapped the doors. Boom: Peaky Blinders reminds us actions may speak louder than words, but wonderfully shot slow-motion explosions are more deafening still.", "description": "Tommy Shelby has tried on many flat-caps for size on Peaky Blinders\u00a0(BBC1):\u00a0lover, killer, one-man Nick Cave murder ballad fan-club.
