And we will take on the most powerful corporations and special interests. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 16, 2019\n\nSanders\u2019 remark follows what many consider to be a solid debate performance, which was essential given his recent heart attack, as it sparked concerns about his overall health.\n\nSanders, however, assured hesitant supporters that he is up for the stress of the job and said he will prove it by mounting a \u201cvigorous campaign\u201d across the nation.\n\n\u201cLet me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. We\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event,\u201d he said, teasing an endorsement from fellow socialist lawmaker Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\n\u201cAnd we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders thanked all those who sent their love, prayers, and support during his health scare, which resulted in doctors putting two stents in a blocked artery.\n\n\u201cBut let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well-wishes,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cAnd I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

There was an America that I dreamed about. There is an America that most people believe in,\u201d she said, noting that it is just \u201can ideal\u201d and \u201cnot reality yet\u201d:\n\n.@BernieSanders isn\u2019t fighting to win just one presidential election \u2014 he\u2019s fighting for the soul of our democracy.
