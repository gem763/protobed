Unfortunately for the people of New York City, or perhaps fortunately depending on your perspective, a recent report shows it looks like he has already quit his current role as mayor of the Big Apple. De Blasio only worked seven hours in May, aka less than one full work day. The rest of time he was on the road campaigning for the 2020 Democratic primary nomination.\n\nThe New York Post reviewed records provided exclusively by a former assistant to De Blasio:\n\nHizzoner showed up at his office on just six occasions in May, taking part in two meetings, four events and five phone calls, one of which was his weekly appearance on WNYC radio, according to entries on his official calendar. The 11 appointments amounted to a meager one-fifth of the 50 meetings, calls and other events at City Hall on de?Blasio\u2019s calendar for May 2019. He had a total 152 city events scheduled for the month.\n\nDe Blasio, for his part, recently claimed that he is working from the campaign trail despite not actually being in New York City.\n\nIn an interview recorded on Friday, De Blasio told Pod Save America,\u201cThere is no question that if you\u2019re running a campaign, you have to put energy into it and attention into it.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t mean this to be pretentious, but it is true, he added. \"Yes, I do wake up every morning; in fact, start with a whole slew of emails with a whole bunch of updates and give instructions from the very beginning of the day to the very end of the day.\"", "description": ".10/02/2019 13:11:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/dee2d2d2-0928-44d8-a6b8-cd5c3ad020e4.png"}
