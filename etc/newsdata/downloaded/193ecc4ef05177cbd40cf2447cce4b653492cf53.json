Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.\n\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam\u2019s Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.\n\n\u201cThe whole district is covered in sorrow,\u201d Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. \u201cThis is a catastrophe for our community.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.\n\n\u201cWe are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,\u201d Nam said.\n\nNam said families had told him they knew relatives were traveling to Britain at the time the container truck was traveling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.\n\nThe British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.\n\nPolice have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.\n\nApart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.\n\n\u2018BEAUTIFUL DAY\u2019\n\nIn Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family\u2019s small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed.\n\n\u201cShe said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,\u201d said Nhung\u2019s cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting and hoping it\u2019s not her among the victims, but it\u2019s very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group\u201d.\n\nIn comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung\u2019s Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.\n\n\u201cNot good,\u201d Nhung replied. \u201cAlmost spring,\u201d she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.\n\nOther photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.\n\n\u201cSuch a beautiful day,\u201d Nhung posted.\n\nAnother person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost his job.\n\nCatholics attend a mass prayer for 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London, UK at My Khanh parish in Nghe An province, Vietnam October 26, 2019.

In the first eight months of this year, 41,790 people left Ha Tinh looking for work elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media.\n\nThe province was ravaged by one of Vietnam\u2019s worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan\u2019s Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries.\n\nAnother suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.\n\n\u201cThat girl who said in her message that she couldn\u2019t breathe in the truck? Her parents can\u2019t breathe here at home,\u201d Nam said.", "description": "Several townships in rural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities believing that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas of the country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445251467&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0K8", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
