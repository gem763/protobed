Photo: Courtesy of the vendors\n\nFrom its origins as standard-issue military gear and the Everyman\u2019s undershirt to super-hyped collaboration tees with brands like Supreme and celebrities like Justin Bieber, the classic white T-shirt comes in many forms. You can now find them for as little as $10 and upward of $300. So, to help you find your go-to white T-shirt in this very comfy sea of Supima cotton, cashmere, and jersey, we spoke to 17 stylish guys from different walks of life about their favorite plain and pocket tees.\n\nBest overall white T-shirt\n\nSunspel Slim Fit Cotton Jersey T-shirt We first wrote about British luxury brand Sunspel after Ian Taylor, the London-based editor-in-chief of FashionBeans, enthusiastically recommended their cotton-jersey boxer briefs. Taylor told us that, despite being pricier than most boxer briefs, Sunspel briefs are made of high-quality jersey material that makes them worth it. In our roundup of the best men\u2019s black T-shirts, Michael Friedberg of Dummies recommended Sunspel\u2019s cotton-jersey T-shirt in black, and columnist Chris Black suggested Sunspel\u2019s white polo shirt in his article about what to wear on a first date. Writer and executive director of the Asian American Writers\u2019 Workshop, Ken Chen, praises the brand\u2019s old-school cotton-jersey British tees for having \u201cinsanely high craftsmanship \u2014 great fit and fabric \u2014 while not being as expensive as it could be.\u201d And the white tee is as beloved among our experts as the rest of them. Queer Eye\u2019s Antoni Porowski calls out Sunspel\u2019s cotton-jersey T-shirt as \u201cthe most perfect white tee. The collar is really nice and thin, the sleeves are just the right length where you don\u2019t have to roll them up, and the proportions are perfect,\u201d he says. Plus, his Sunspel T-shirts don\u2019t turn yellow in the armpits the way his other white T-shirts do, Porowski says. Though $90 is more than you\u2019d pay for many tees, he offers this tip for making them last longer: \u201cI never put mine in the dryer. I just let them hang dry. I study this shit. I\u2019m very passionate about white T-shirts.\u201d $90 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) overall white T-shirt\n\nHanes Tagless T-shirt It\u2019s no secret that Hanes makes a great basic T-shirt, and at a price that means you won\u2019t feel bad if you ruin them with pit stains or food splatter. So we\u2019re not surprised to see them so high on this list. In his article about the best basic white T-shirts, Black recommends the subtly logoed Hanes x Supreme collaboration tees for men who consider themselves streetwear bros. But two of our stylish experts \u2014 both Walter Binger, owner of Empanadas, Son! restaurant, and Alexander Chee, author of The Queen of the Night \u2014 called out this less-expensive and easier-to-find tee from Hanes (Hanes x Supreme collaboration tees can only be found on resale sites like StockX and eBay right now). \u201cThere is a level of consistency and the comfort to knowing you can have the same thing whenever you want it,\u201d says Binger. Since Chee wears them daily, he appreciates that his favorite tagless T-shirts aren\u2019t too precious. \u201cI only buy white T-shirts as undershirts now. I drink too much coffee, usually while walking, so I just kept ruining them immediately,\u201d he says. From $8 at Amazon Buy From $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest white T-shirt for creative types\n\nUniqlo Men\u2019s Supima Cotton Crew Neck Short-Sleeve Shirt $10 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nUniqlo T-shirts are the not-so-secret fashion weapon of creative types. And at under 20 bucks, they\u2019re cheap enough to buy in bulk. Mickey Pangilinan, an art director at Apple, is a fan of Uniqlo U crew neck T-shirts because of their \u201cweighty material and nice texture.\u201d He likes that the fit is \u201ca little bit boxy at the shoulders but not long on the waist.\u201d Additionally, Black recommends Uniqlo\u2019s Supima cotton crew neck T-shirts for the kind of man who works in a creative field and mostly wears jeans to work.\n\nBest 6-pack white T-shirt\n\nGildan Men\u2019s Crew T-Shirt Multipack When shopping for himself, Black prefers Gildan six-packs because he can wear them \u201cwithout concern until they need to be disposed of and just order more,\u201d he says. \u201cThey look good under a hooded sweatshirt, a cardigan, or even a suit.\u201d Gildan T-shirts also came up in our piece about the best men\u2019s black T-shirts. They were recommended by Jon Caramanica, pop critic and men\u2019s Critical Shopper columnist for the New York Times, who appreciates that the Canadian tees are \u201cdurable, cut wide, but not in any way boxy\u201d and feature what he calls \u201can unflappable crew neck.\u201d Caramanica\u2019s favorite thing about Gildans black T-shirt also applies to the white version: \u201cRun it through the wash a couple of times and the personality begins to emerge,\u201d he says. From $16 for 6 at Amazon Buy From $16 for 6 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest white T-shirt with a pocket\n\nJ.Crew Garment-dyed slub cotton crewneck T-shirt Writer and editor John Lockett says that his favorite white T-shirt from J.Crew \u201cchecks all the boxes: loungy with that lived-in feel, yet stylish and refined enough to stand on its own (and in public), and not crazy expensive.\u201d Lockett also notes that this garment-dyed tee isn\u2019t blindingly white, so it works well with everything in his closet and for pretty much any occasion. $33 at J.Crew Buy\n\nBest heavyweight white T-shirt with a pocket\n\nFGS heavyweight white T-shirt with a pocket If you believe that T-shirts should start out crisp rather than \u201cloungy,\u201d Jou-Yie Chou of Public Supply and Studio Tack has something for you. \u201cMy go-to is made by Front Street General Store in Dumbo\u201d says Chou. He likes the Japanese tees because they\u2019re heavyweight, cut straight with a square pocket, and because, as he puts it, they \u201cwork with my dad bod and aren\u2019t ubiquitous.\u201d $38 at Front Street General Buy\n\nBest two-pack white T-shirt with a pocket\n\nVelva Sheen Men\u2019s 2 Pack Short Sleeve Pocket Tee Velva Sheen tees have a similar weight, feel, and price to the tees from Front General Store. The Japanese T-shirt two-pack used to be on constant back order, but now they\u2019re available on Amazon, which makes them easier to buy but also means they\u2019re a tiny bit little less exclusive. Nevertheless, Evan Parker, vice-president of content at NASCAR, calls them the best, \u201chands down.\u201d Parker says he\u2019s tried every brand out there and still comes back to these. He says they\u2019re \u201ccut modern enough to wear in 2019, while still looking like something your grandpa probably wore under his work shirt. They hold up well over time and actually look better the more you wear them.\u201d $85 at Amazon Buy $85 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) white T-shirt with a pocket\n\nComfort Colors Mens Pigment-Dyed Shirt If you like the look of FSG or Velva Sheen tees but aren\u2019t crazy about the price, Pangilinan says this shirt is a good alternative. It\u2019s \u201csubstantial and a little bit boxy with a worn-in feel,\u201d he says. According to him, you\u2019ll get the best price if you buy them in Maine. \u201cI normally stock up on Comfort Colors every summer when I go up to Maine. I get them from a local store called Reny\u2019s, and they\u2019re usually like $3 or $4 each,\u201d says Pangilinan. \u201cBut when I can\u2019t wait till the summer, I buy them on Amazon.\u201d From $10 at Amazon Buy From $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest white T-shirt to tuck in\n\nKirkland Signature Men\u2019s 100% Cotton Classic Fit Tee 3 Pack For something in the Hanes price range with substantially more normcore cach\u00e9, designer Shakeil Greeley likes Kirkland Signature crew necks, though he told us he routinely cuts the collars off of his because the increased breathing room for your neck is quite nice. \u201cNot only are they super cheap, but they are also very comfortable,\u201d Greeley says. He also likes that they\u2019re long enough to tuck and more durable than you\u2019d expect. From $25 for 3 at Amazon Buy From $25 for 3 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest slightly stretchy white T-shirt\n\nSave Khaki Supima Crew T-shirt in White Not everybody wants their T-shirts to feel \u201cheavyweight\u201d or to look like a workwear gem. For a slightly more fluid fit, private wealth adviser (and husband of the Man Repeller) Abie Cohen suggests this cotton-jersey tapered-fit tee. \u201cTheir tees cling or stretch more than a department-store brand and wash very well,\u201d he says. Cohen wears his to the gym just as often as he wears them out to dinner. $50 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nBest slim-fit white T-shirt\n\nReigning Champ Short Sleeve Crewneck T-shirt Kentaro Sakata, a doctor and writer in Melbourne, Australia recommends Reigning Champ\u2019s slim-fit T-shirts because \u201cthe cotton feels durable but not thick.\u201d He also likes that the modern cut and subtle details that make it feel less like an undershirt than other basic crew necks. $55 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest roomy white T-shirt\n\nH&M Crew-neck T-shirt Regular fit \u201cThese shirts give me enough room to move without looking like I\u2019m wearing a poncho,\u201d says Rohan Nadkarni, Staff Writer at Sports Illustrated. Nadkarni says these T-shirts are cut more generously than the Reigning Champ tees mentioned above, but not in an obvious way. That means you can still layer them under a button-down or casually throw one on with sweats for a bacon, egg, and cheese run. Also, as Nadkarni puts it, \u201ctheir slightest bit of sheen makes them look like a small-but-important step up.\u201d $7 at H&M Buy\n\nBest white T-shirt for summer\n\nPhoto: Arian Camilleri/Arian Camilleri Alex Mill Standard T-Shirt in Slub Cotton Another first-date pick from Chris Black is this slub tee from Alex Mill. Black wrote about this T-shirt in the dead of summer. He likes that it is \u201cnot too thin, not too thick,\u201d and that it fits well. $45 at Alex Mill Buy\n\nBest recycled cotton white T-shirt\n\nEverybody World Classic Trash Tee When we asked Sam Hine, associate style editor at GQ and GQ Style to pick a perfect plain white T-shirt he started by telling us what all his favorite graphic tees have in common: \u201csmooth, heavy fabric, wide ribbing at the neck, and a perfectly boxy fit.\u201d Everybody World Trash Tees have all those qualities and more. As Hine puts it, they\u2019re \u201cthe blank of choice for pretty much all of the fly-est upstart streetwear brands (Noah, Awake) and Shopify merch operations (Online Ceramics, Come Tees) in fashion.\u201d The shirts are made of recycled cotton, which Hine says is \u201csurprisingly cutting edge in the industry and impossible to find at a sub-$30 price point.\u201d $25 at Everybody World Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
