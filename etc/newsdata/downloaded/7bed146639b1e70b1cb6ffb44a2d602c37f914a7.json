Is it a surprise to anyone that Labuschagne and Steve Smith had huge smiles on their faces when joining at the crease together for the first time in a Test with the score 28 for two with Stuart Broad on the cusp of busting through Australia\u2019s top order in another vital Ashes rubber?\n\nWhen the Queenslander was picked in this squad, not a lot was known about him by those outside the Australian cricketing beltway. Sure, he turned out in a handful of Tests while the Sandpaper Trio were serving their bans, tucking in handsomely for Glamorgan as well, but when he strode out as Smith\u2019s concussion substitute on the final day of the Lord\u2019s Test, the prevailing talking point was the Australianised pronunciation of his Afrikaans surname.\n\nThree weeks later, Labuschagne is a known quantity to the point where \u2013 Smith aside \u2013 he is the most important batsman in Australia\u2019s line-up. Certainly so with David Warner struggling to get out of first gear. Where the opener is getting out early and often \u2013 on this occasion dismissed by indecision \u2013 the new kid on the block is starting his contributions with a meditative degree of abstinence. On Wednesday, CricViz assessed him as having played just two aggressive strokes to the first 36 balls he faced \u2013 driving a pair of half-volleys. Across four innings in this series, he\u2019s attacking fewer than one in ten in his initial 30 deliveries.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

When going through his golden period \u2013 the apex of which was the Ashes of 2017-18 \u2013 he would often discuss the control he needed to exercise across his first 30 balls. Through to that point, his batting average when reaching that early milestone was an absurd 85. But now, Smith\u2019s idiosyncratic leaving technique isn\u2019t so idiosyncratic \u2013 Labuschagne has all-but adopted it, especially early on. Who better to emulate than the cricketer with the second-best statistical record in the history of the sport?\n\nOnce into his groove, Labuschagne cut a pair of identical boundaries off Jack Leach before the spinner found his range, then dispatched two floaty Craig Overton deliveries as the recalled quick located his own. There was a close call for leg before when Ben Stokes got it hooping and a catch that nearly carried to midwicket, but he went to lunch one short of another half-century. When it came two balls after what turned out to be a three-hour breather due to rain, from his 88th delivery, he became just the fourth player to raise his bat four times in a row to start his Ashes career. Mike Hussey did it five times. Would it surprise anyone if he match Mr Cricket?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Granted, he wasn\u2019t so rapid this time around but the first stanza of this rematch was made to feel underwhelming by Smith\u2019s routine when getting to his happy place. He made it uneventful. Instructive, too, was how he made the most of a couple of sloppy offerings from the other man trying to define the series in his name \u2013 Stokes. Driving and pulling the all-rounder, he was quick to 20 and set.\n\nAfter the mizzle, as beach balls and crisp packets and bails and hats drove Broad to distraction, it didn\u2019t Smith. Such was his confidence, he was willing to slump to his front knee to slay Stokes through point to bring up his own 50. Labuschagne may now have four against England, but the master now has clocked eight on the trot \u2013 more than anyone, ever.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit surreal,\u201d Labuschagne said at stumps when reflecting on his first partnership with his kindred spirit, worth 126. \u201cI love talking to him about the game and learning off him, it\u2019s a great experience and he\u2019s a great player. I\u2019m just taking in as much as I can. We\u2019re constantly talking out there about what the bowler is trying to do and what he\u2019s trying to do. We\u2019re thinking similar, thinking about where they\u2019re trying to get us out and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nIt took a big, biting cutter reminiscent of Overton\u2019s first wicket in Test cricket at Adelaide in November 2017 \u2013 where he picked up Smith \u2013 to get rid of Labuschagne, kissing his off-stump on 67. He left the field furious that day one wouldn\u2019t be the day where he secured a Test ton for the first time. But his job, once again, was done. While neither he nor Smith have played an innings in this series that hasn\u2019t resulted in at least a half-century \u2013 the rest of their teammates combined are averaging 18. And Smith gets to go again in the morning, resuming on 60. Would it surprise anyone if he salutes again? Of course not.", "description": "Is it\u00a0a surprise to anyone that Marnus Labuschagne was walking through the streets of Manchester with Steve Waugh the evening before this Old Trafford Test?
