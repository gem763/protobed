To my mind this should be Northumbria, which exposed the lies the Met police failed to spot.'\n\nA cabinet minister also said the police failings 'should not be left to lie'.\n\nThey said: 'Knowingly misleading the courts is extremely serious and of huge gravity. There needs to be a full and frank investigation into this, which could lead to a criminal inquiry into whether the course of justice has been perverted by the police.'\n\nMr Proctor said said that a further review ordered by Priti Patel was only the 'first step'.\n\nHe added that Northumbria Police which secured Beech's convictions was ideally placed to take on the case.\n\nMore findings of the highly critical review of Operation Midland, which has to date cost the Metropolitan Police around \u00a34.5million, were published by the force after mounting pressure to be open and transparent.\n\nCarl Beech's easily-disproved lies were swallowed by police who have spent \u00a34.5m on their bungled investigation and subsequent payouts\n\nMet Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick (pictured), who oversaw the early stages of Operation Midland, has previously rejected demands for a new investigation into the officers involved\n\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson was found to have added to the pressure on investigating officers, who were 'fearful of media criticism and public cynicism,' according to the report.\n\nAmong a string of recommendations for the force, Sir Richard said suspects should have their anonymity protected by law, victims should be asked to sign confidentiality agreements in cases involving 'prominent people' and the policy that a complainant's account 'must be believed' should end.\n\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson denied putting pressure on police\n\nThe police complaints watchdog will explain next week why it has already exonerated five officers of misconduct.\n\nIn an interview with LBC Harvey Proctor spoke about his ongoing battle with PTSD after 'Nick' the fantasist told police the former Tory MP was a member of a VIP pedophile ring.\n\nThis evening Mr Proctor said he only feels 'icy contempt' for Carl Beech because it was the Metropolitan Police who gave rise to his lies.\n\nMr Proctor also told Andrew Pierce he is 'saving' his 'fire power for the metropolitan police'.\n\nThe homes of Mr Proctor, D-Day veteran Lord Bramall and Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former home secretary Leon Brittan, were raided on the basis of false claims made by fantasist Carl Beech, then known as 'Nick'.\n\nTearful ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor opens up about his battle with PTSD over 'Nick the fantasist' claims and blasts 'donkey' police chiefs after damning report reveals Scotland Yard's shocking failures in \u00a34.5m probe\n\nHarvey Proctor spoke about his ongoing battle with PTSD after 'Nick' the fantasist told police the former Tory MP was a member of a VIP pedophile ring.\n\nThe 72-year-old revealed he is still under 'substantial emotional stress' from a 'matter that has been going on for years' - after Carl Beech claimed he was directly involved in two murders and multiple counts of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nTearful Mr Proctor's voice broke as he said he 'will be thinking about these matters on the day I die' and he repeatedly apologised for being emotional.\n\n'I tried to keep strong but sometimes I do get emotional - I'm sorry if I do,' he told LBC.\n\nFormer Conservative MP Harvey Proctor (pictured on ITV's Good Morning Britain in July) said he had lost 'my job, my home, my repute' following claims that he was involved in sexual abuse\n\nHe 'would not wish my worst enemy to go through what I, my family and my friends have gone through' and called the ordeal 'horrendous' as he struggled for words.\n\nIt comes after a damning 400-page analysis by retired high court judge Sir Richard Henriques identified dozens of implausible claims which police failed to check.\n\nThe Henriques report insisted police missed countless opportunities to close the case down. And this evening Mr Proctor told Andrew Pierce he is 'saving' his 'fire power for the metropolitan police'.\n\n'I have to keep strong because if I dwell too much on detail I dissemble. I keep strong to try to make sure no other person suffers at the hand of the met police from false accusers,' he added.\n\n'No one should go through what I went through these last few years.'\n\nHe criticised Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Cressida Dick for 'weasel words of apology' after claims he was a member of a Westminster paedophile ring left him facing death threats.\n\nAnd this evening Mr Proctor said he only feels 'icy contempt' for Carl Beech because it was the Metropolitan Police who gave rise to his lies.\n\n'In my impact statement at the conclusion of his trial I referred to 'Nick' with icy contempt. That is what I feel. Icy contempt,' he told LBC.\n\nSir Richard criticised the Met's culture of believing victims and Sir Steve House (pictured) said the force had 're-explained' its policy to detectives\n\n'If Carl Beech wanted to spread his fantasies on social media do you think I would give a damn. It was when police who said he was credible and true and that was when the damage was done to me.'\n\nAs the hour-long interview came to a close he blasted police chiefs, calling them 'donkeys' who should not be leading the 'brave and courageous bobby on the beat'.\n\n'When I was an MP I was supportive of the police force. I am now supportive in this way,' he added.\n\n'I think bobby on the beat is brave and courageous. They do not deserve to be led by donkeys.'\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World At One he lost 'my job, my home, my repute' following false claims that he was involved in the sexual abuse.\n\nHe admitted he was 'not the same person I used to be' as a damning report laid bare Scotland Yard's shocking failures when investigating the case.\n\nHe said: 'I'm trying to get over it, but it's proving very difficult. I have said before that I'm not the same person I used to be.\n\n'I don't think I'll ever be that person again. I've lost my job, my home, my repute. I've been the subject of death threats.\n\n'Weasel words by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Cressida Dick by way of apology, but nothing to put me back to where I was in March 2015 when I'd spent 30 years building myself up to that position, after an earlier difficulty.\n\n'I don't have another 30 years to re-do that.'\n\nThe homes of Mr Proctor, D-Day veteran Lord Bramall and Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former home secretary Leon Brittan, were raided on the basis of false claims made by fantasist Carl Beech, then known as 'Nick'.\n\nThen-force chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has made a series of extraordinary apologies over the disastrous investigation, that has to date cost the force around \u00a34.5 million.\n\nThis includes payouts to the Brittan family and Lord Bramall. Mr Proctor is suing the Met for \u00a31million and a settlement has yet to be reached.\n\nSir Alan Duncan, Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, said: 'The damming Henriques report against the Met Police should not be used to delay the payment of massive compensation to my constituent Harvey Proctor.\n\n'They must agree to settle his financial claim and pay up now. The police are supposed to be there to address injustice but here they have themselves created it. They must compensate my constituent Harvey Proctor.'\n\nIt came as Scotland Yard was accused of 'institutional stupidity' in its disastrous investigation into claims of the VIP paedophile ring in Westminster as the report blamed 'poor judgment and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts'.\n\nThe report concluded search warrants were 'obtained unlawfully' and that the magistrate who granted them was 'misled'.\n\nScotland Yard said it was 'deeply, deeply sorry' for mistakes made in the bungled Operation Midland investigation and the detective in charge has apologised but said he acted with the best of intentions.\n\nDowning Street said it was 'vital' the public was reassured the Met had learned lessons, while Labour deputy leader Tom Watson failed to apologise despite the report concluding his interest put pressure on police.\n\nCarl Beech - known as 'Nick' - was jailed for 18 years for perverting the course after making up preposterous tales, dubbed 'credible and true' by the Met, that ruined the lives and reputations of some of Britain's most distinguished public servants.\n\nLies told by Carl Beech, pictured left in a police interview, were believed by the Met Police despite previously Wiltshire Police having concluded: 'it all sounds a bit 'Spooks'\n\nHis easily-disproved lies were swallowed by bungling Scotland Yard detectives who launched a taxpayer-funded 'witchhunt', Operation Midland, that resulted in Thatcher's Home Secretary Lord Brittan dying under a cloud of suspicion and an ex-Tory MP losing his job and home.\n\nThe Met has faced howls of criticism after it emerged that none of the five officers referred to the IOPC for their involvement in the case faced any censure.\n\nIn a series of damning findings - first published by the Mail after exclusive interviews with Sir Richard - his report concluded that search warrants for the homes of men Beech accused were 'obtained unlawfully' and that the magistrate who granted them was 'misled'.\n\n'The written applications stated that 'Nick's' account had remained consistent and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth,' it said.\n\n''Nick's' account had not been consistent throughout. Further, there were, in my judgment no reasonable grounds to believe 'Nick' and the statement that he had told the truth was not consistent with information then available.'\n\nThe report said: 'Whilst the responsible officers assert that they kept an open mind, several failures can only be explained by an unwarranted and disproportionate belief in 'Nick's' credibility.\n\n'The most significant error in this investigation was the decision to apply for search warrants coupled with formulating inaccurate statements which were placed before the district judge.\n\n'But for that decision, this investigation may well have been completed without the dreadful adverse consequences I have described.'\n\nThe full report released 43 'principal police failings'. Among them Sir Richard found that the Metropolitan Police:\n\nBelieved Beech from the outset while Wiltshire police had found his claims 'all a bit odd' and said 'it all sounds a bit 'Spooks' '\n\nWere months late in interviewing Beech's ex-wife and his mother, both of who testimonies contradicted his claims\n\nCarried out searches poorly: property was seized which was authorised by the warrant, the North Yorkshire search was conducted 'as if looking for bodies or body parts', property was not returned properly, and police contributed to the loss of anonymity of the accused\n\nAsked a psychologist to examine Beech, but did not provide his police interviews or blogs\n\nDid not ask to inspect Beech's computer because of the policy that 'victims must be believed'\n\nFailed to check Beech's computer when he provided emails, allegedly from a corroborating witness, which were copied-and-pasted to obscure the sender\n\nShould have terminated the investigation in December 2015 on advice from CPS\n\nShould have dropped the investigation into Harvey Proctor in January 2016 when they dropped the case relating to Lord Bramall - because if Beech was unreliable in relation to one alleged abuser he was unreliable in relation to the other\n\nMet Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House said: 'I am deeply, deeply sorry for the mistakes that were made and the ongoing pain these have caused.\n\n'I promise we will do all we can to prevent them in the future.'\n\nHe also said: 'The Met is determined to learn lessons from Sir Richard's review to improve our response to similar situations in the future', and added: 'Mistakes were made in Operation Midland and we have apologised for those. We apologise for them again today.'\n\nBut, he added: 'However, we do not agree with everything Sir Richard wrote in his report or indeed all of his recent statements regarding further investigations into the actions of officers.'\n\nHe insisted the IOPC had cleared officers of misconduct saying: 'That should be where this ends for those individuals.'\n\nThe report blamed the force's policy of believing victims as a core failing underlying the investigation.\n\nThe deputy commissioner told reporters outside New Scotland Yard: 'We've re-explained to officers' the force's position on belief.'\n\nHe added: 'We explained we expect them to deal with all victims sensitively, to record their allegation accurately, but then to carry out an investigative function which would include gaining corroboration for the allegation themselves.'\n\nSteve Rodhouse, who oversaw the operation, said: 'I am sincerely sorry for the distress that has been caused to innocent people and their families as a consequence of Operation Midland and Operation Vincente.'\n\nBut, he added: 'My actions have been considered by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) who will shortly publish their detailed reasons for concluding that there was no misconduct by me.\n\n'I understand the criticisms that have been made of my decisions during these investigations but I acted with the best of intentions throughout and I hope that I have demonstrated the transparency, honesty and integrity which have always been vital to me.'\n\nOne source who read a pre-released copy of the report said Mr Rodhouse's new \u00a3240,000-a-year job at the National Crime Agency is 'untenable' and that he must step down or be removed from his post immediately.\n\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson denied putting pressure on police despite the report finding his interest did in fact do so.\n\nThe report quoted an article from 2015 revealing how Mr Watson spoke to two people including Beech who claimed he was abused by former home secretary Leon Brittan and had been attacked more than a dozen times as a boy.\n\nThe report said: 'There can be no doubt that Tom Watson believed 'Nick' and it should be stated that he had previously provided the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) with information leading to convictions in other cases.\n\n'His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS officers.'\n\nIn a statement Mr Watson said: 'The report doesn't make clear the key point that Lord Brittan was interviewed by the police before they received my letter.\n\n'Ex-director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders publicly confirmed that my letter was not received by police until after the interview.\n\n'It therefore cannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed.\n\n'I have always said that it wasn't my place to judge whether sexual abuse allegations were true or false \u2013 that was for the police.'\n\nDaniel Janner, the son of the late Labour MP Lord Janner who was one of Beech's victims, accused Mr Watson of being 'partially responsible'.\n\nHe claimed Mr Watson - who raised the matter in Parliament after speaking to Beech - 'applied pressure on the police and should hang his head in shame and resign'.\n\nAnd Lord Brittan's widow told The Times: 'The extent of Tom Watson's involvement in the witch-hunt of innocent people has been laid bare for all to see.\n\n'His subsequent attempts to distance himself show a complete lack of integrity.\n\n'By misusing his public office to recklessly repeat false allegations, and to characterise himself as a victim, he has shown that he is unfit to hold the office of MP.'\n\nAfter the report's release, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve House was asked about Mr Watson's role in pressuring police.\n\nHe said: 'I won't refer direct to Tom Watson, I think you're going to have to speak to him more about that.\n\n'But I think it's quite clear, at the time there was a significant amount of pressure on a lot of different public bodies in relation to not taking seriously, allegations around this sort of assault.\n\nA heavily redacted summary of a report by retired high court judge Sir Richard Henriques - which identified 43 major blunders in Operation Midland - was released three years ago after the inquiry was closed without any arrests or charges.\n\nThen-force chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe made a series of extraordinary apologies over the disastrous investigation, that has to date cost the force around \u00a34.5 million. This includes payouts to the Brittan family and Lord Bramall. Mr Proctor is suing the Met for \u00a31 million and a settlement has yet to be reached.\n\nYesterday the Mail revealed that Home Secretary Priti Patel has told the Inspectorate of Constabulary, the police watchdog, to review the force's actions as well.\n\nAmong its principal conclusions the report finds:\n\n'The principal cause of the many failures in this investigation was poor judgement and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts'\n\nA 'major contributing factor was the culture that 'victims' must be believed'\n\nThe 'most significant error' was the application for search warrants coupled with formulating inaccurate statements which were placed before the district judge. But for that decision, Sir Richard found, 'this investigation may well have been completed without the dreadful adverse consequences I have described.'\n\nPolice who raided Lord Brittan's home in VIP sex probe just weeks after he died swabbed his shoes for DNA and rifled through letters of condolence without telling his widow what was happening, damning report reveals\n\nBy Emer Scully for MailOnline\n\nLord Brittan's shoes were swabbed for DNA as police officers combed through his garden in front of his grieving widow, yesterday's damning report revealed.\n\nLeon Brittan's country home in north Yorkshire was descended on by 20 police officers at 8.20am on March 4, 2015, as part of Operation Midland - the police unit dedicated to uncovering the existence of a made-up VIP Westminster sex ring.\n\nJust weeks after Lord Proctor's death on January 21 his grieving widow was forced to watch with no explanation as officers read through her husband's condolence letters.\n\nJust weeks after Lord Proctor's death on January 21 his grieving widow Lady Proctor (pictured with her husband) was forced to watch with no explanation as officers read through her husband's condolence letters\n\nTheir housekeeper said it looked like officers were searching his garden for shallow graves.\n\nThe police presence attracted attention from neighbours and Lady Brittan begged for her curtains to be closed to offer privacy.\n\nAt the same time Lord Bramall's residence in Surrey and the home Harvey Proctor was given on the Belvoir estate where he worked as private secretary to the Duke of Rutland were both turned upside down.\n\nBut as the elderly gentlemen's behaviour in the 1970s and 1980s was called in to question, Carl Beech - a former hospital manager and now a convicted liar - was telling news agency Exavo News the search had started.\n\nSir Richard Henriques' report in to Operation Midland detailed the scene Lady Brittan faced during the police search of her husband's belongings.\n\nThe report read: 'Lady Brittan found the search very distressing. There was a large number of officers and she was still grieving; Lord Brittan having died only weeks earlier.\n\nAt the same time Lord Bramall's (pictured in July 2014) residence in Surrey and the home Harvey Proctor was given on the Belvoir estate where he worked as private secretary to the Duke of Rutland were both turned upside down\n\n'She was deeply shocked by the search. One particular event caused much distress. Officers searched through letters of condolence.'\n\nSir Richard finds the warrants were 'obtained unlawfully' when they were authorised by a detective inspector and applied for by a detective sergeant.\n\nThe application said Beech's accusations of the fictitious crimes had 'remained consistent' despite multiple statements not quite adding up.\n\nSir Richard said: 'Throughout the day Lord Bramall asked questions in an endeavour to ascertain the nature of the allegations.\n\n'He wishes to know what the magistrate had been told in order to grant the warrant but was not told.'\n\nIt comes as Harvey Proctor spoke about his ongoing battle with PTSD after 'Nick' the fantasist told police the former Tory MP was a member of a VIP pedophile ring.\n\nThe 72-year-old revealed he is still under 'substantial emotional stress' from a 'matter that has been going on for years' - after Carl Beech claimed he was directly involved in two murders and multiple counts of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nTearful Mr Proctor's voice broke as he said he 'will be thinking about these matters on the day I die' and he repeatedly apologised for being emotional.\n\n'I tried to keep strong but sometimes I do get emotional - I'm sorry if I do,' he told LBC.\n\nHe 'would not wish my worst enemy to go through what I, my family and my friends have gone through' and called the ordeal 'horrendous' as he struggled for words.\n\nHow is this man STILL in the job? He drove the botched 'Nick the fantasist' inquiry and was damned in the judge's report... only to be promoted to run Britain's 'FBI' on \u00a3245,000 a year\n\nBy Paul Bracchi for the Daily Mail\n\nSteve Rodhouse, in his previous role at Scotland Yard as deputy assistant commissioner, was in charge of the catastrophic Operation Midland investigation into the non-existent \u2018VIP paedophile ring.\u2019 He now enjoys a pay package of up to \u00a3245,000 a year\n\nSteve Rodhouse is one of the highest-ranking police officers in the country. As Director General (Operations) of the National Crime Agency, he is second in command of Britain\u2019s equivalent to America\u2019s FBI.\n\nHe enjoys a pay package of up to \u00a3245,000 a year and a pension pot worth almost \u00a32million. On his drive is a sporty Audi TT.\n\nBut does he really deserve to be where he is?\n\nSurely there can\u2019t be many, even in the police, who believe he does \u2013 not today, in the light of what we have now found out about him in his previous role at Scotland Yard when as deputy assistant commissioner he was in charge of the catastrophic Operation Midland investigation into the non-existent \u2018VIP paedophile ring.\u2019\n\nIn 2016, retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques produced an excoriating report on the failings of the inquiry in general, but vital sections (43 in all), including the shortcomings of individual detectives, were redacted.\n\nYesterday, the largely uncensored version was published, and it could not have been more critical of former DAC Rodhouse \u2013 of his judgment, of his decision-making and of his professionalism, which ultimately resulted in \u00a32.5million of public money \u2013 and 16 months \u2013 being spent on the say-so of a single \u2018source\u2019, the now convicted fantasist Carl Beech, aka Nick.\n\nMr Rodhouse\u2019s personal performance is laid bare for the first time. He is accused of basic failures, such as not being abreast of the evidence when he allowed Nick\u2019s \u2018highly implausible\u2019 story to be declared \u2018credible and true\u2019.\n\nA 2016 report was critical of former DAC Rodhouse's (left) judgment, of his decision-making and of his professionalism, which ultimately resulted in \u00a32.5million of public money being spent on false claims made by now convicted fantasist Carl Beech (right)\n\nThis was an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 and \u2018prejudicial\u2019 strategy, to quote Sir Richard, which he then compounded by ignoring glaring \u2018inconsistencies\u2019 in Nick\u2019s farcical testimony, obtaining search warrants \u2018unlawfully\u2019 and, most unforgivably, appearing to give \u2018no sufficient consideration to the plight of suspects,\u2019 while giving \u2018every possible consideration\u2019 to Nick.\n\nThe cruelty inflicted on the suspects because Mr Rodhouse and his team \u2018were unusually indulgent of Nick\u2019 is especially damning.\n\nYet, one of the most startling passages in the near 400-page report is the bullish, self-serving statement made by Mr Rodhouse himself.\n\nHe said: \u2018Officers were under immense pressure to do the right thing and to keep an open mind. The motivation was to find the truth. We suspect we have not been able to achieve this.\n\n\u2018Charges, prosecutions and convictions cannot be the only barometer of success. We cannot only investigate the obviously guilty. Our decisions were brave and taken in good faith.\u2019\n\nBut, as detailed below, Sir Richard deconstructs Mr Rodhouse\u2019s cataclysmic decisions with the kind of forensic rigour sadly lacking in the investigation itself.\n\nRodhouse (left) gave evidence in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee at the House of Commons on the police investigation into the late Lord Brittan. Lord Brittan was cleared. But only after his death\n\n\u2018WE BELIEVE NICK\u2019\n\nFrom the outset, DAC Rodhouse was, in fact, guilty of precisely the opposite. It was his deputy, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald, who uttered the now notorious sentence, that he and his fellow officers \u2018believe what Nick is saying to be credible and true\u2019 during a Press conference in December, 2014. But the decision to do so was taken by Mr Rodhouse, who was sitting beside him. This is quite clear from an entry Mr Rodhouse made in the \u2018decision log\u2019.\n\n\u2018I anticipate that Kenny or I will be asked if we \u201cbelieve Nick\u201d,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018This is a significant issue and one with the potential to provide either reassurance or concern to other witnesses. Any indication that we will doubt the word of victims will undermine our efforts for them to come forward and will damage our relationship with Nick. Decision: if asked we will confirm that we do believe Nick...\u2019\n\nSir Richard was scathing. \u2018If the DAC did believe Nick, his judgment was at fault,\u2019 he said. \u2018If he did not believe Nick he had decided to mislead the public.\u2019 Either way, \u2018it was a serious mistake\u2019. Sir Richard said: \u2018These words should never have been spoken.\u2019\n\nRODHOUSE NEVER EVEN READ NICK\u2019S BLOGS\n\nEven before the Press conference there were many reasons for doubting Nick\u2019s credibility, Sir Richard said. Nick\u2019s online blogs contained conflicting accounts of his alleged abuse. His allegations had also been investigated by Wiltshire Police, which took no action.\n\nMr Rodhouse never met Nick and had not read Nick\u2019s interview with Wiltshire officers or his blogs. Sir Richard added: \u2018Careful analysis of the interviews and blogs would have demonstrated that Nick was neither consistent or credible.\u2019\n\nLines of inquiry that should have exposed Nick\u2019s lies were either not pursued or ignored. One crucial lead was a \u2018corroborating\u2019 witness called Fred. \u2018The DAC,\u2019 said Sir Richard, \u2018reiterated the need to explore all options regarding Fred.\u2019 Yet data that could have established his whereabouts and identity was never examined. \u2018This is a classic demonstration,\u2019 said the judge, \u2018of the difference between investigating and believing an allegation.\u2019\n\nIt turned out after Operation Midland was closed in 2016 without any arrests that Fred was Nick using another email address.\n\nThe judge said the DAC\u2019s statement suggested his decision-making in the post-Savile era was driven by \u2018potential public criticism and not rigorous analysis of the facts\u2019.\n\nOf those accused by Nick, he said the likelihood of former prime minister Edward Heath, future home secretary Lord Brittan, former heads of MI5 and MI6, serving Field Marshal Lord Bramall, retired general Sir Hugh Beach, Labour MP Greville Janner, Tory MP Harvey Proctor and DJ Jimmy Savile \u2018conspiring to commit rape and, in some cases, child murder is again highly improbable\u2019.\n\nFormer Conservative MP Harvey Proctor (left) and Lord Brittan (right) were both falsely accused by fantasist Carl Beech\n\nUNLAWFUL WARRANTS\n\nPolice raided the home of Lady Brittan months after her husband\u2019s death in 2015, along with those of Lord Bramall and Mr Proctor.\n\nBefore applying for the search warrants, Mr Rodhouse wrote in the decision log that \u2018Nick had remained consistent and detailed in all his accounts\u2019 \u2013 one of the criteria for permission to be granted.\n\nBut Sir Richard is in no doubt that the district judge who granted the warrants \u2018was misled\u2019, adding: \u2018Nick had not been consistent. Several undermining factors were omitted from the application.\u2019 They are listed in his report: \u2018No witnesses had come forward despite extensive media coverage, Fred was either unwilling to engage or an invention of Nick, Nick\u2019s mother does not recall signs of abuse or Nick\u2019s absences.\u2019\n\nAlso, one of the three boys allegedly murdered by the paedophile ring was found alive. There was no record of an incident involving the first and no identity for the third.\n\nThe discrepancies, in Sir Richard\u2019s judgment, meant the warrants were \u2018obtained unlawfully\u2019.\n\nHE KNEW RAIDS WOULD CAUSE DISTRESS\n\nDAC Rodhouse knew perfectly well that the raids, almost certainly unlawful, remember, could result in the \u2018suspects\u2019 being identified. He says so in the case files.\n\n\u2018I consider it possible that the execution of these warrants will become known in the public domain... any such knowledge of the searches could cause public distress and embarrassment for named suspects and their families.\u2019\n\nHours after Mr Proctor\u2019s home was targeted, a story appeared on the now discredited and defunct Exaro website with the headline \u2018Police raid Harvey Proctor\u2019s home under Operation Midland: Former Conservative MP faces police investigation into allegations of child abuse\u2019. The other so-called suspects were also identified.\n\nMr Rodhouse was exonerated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission of any blame over Operation Midland in 2017.\n\nThe following year he was promoted to his current post at the National Crime Agency (NCA).\n\nNCA director general Lynne Owens said: \u2018He brings a wealth of knowledge and practical skills that further strengthen our response to fighting serious and organised crime in the UK.\u2019 Of Operation Midland there was no mention.\n\nBut yesterday, to his credit, Steve Rodhouse issued a public apology over his handling of the inquiry. \u2018I am sincerely sorry for the distress that has been caused to innocent people and their families. I sincerely regret the damage that the investigation caused to the reputations of those who were accused and for the hurt felt by their families.\u2019\n\nLORD BRITTAN TARGETED AGAIN\n\nMr Rodhouse came in for equally scathing criticism over Operation Vincente \u2013 the investigation into false rape claims, dating back more than 45 years, against Leon Brittan. They came from a Labour activist with a history of mental health problems calling herself \u2018Jane\u2019.\n\nLord Brittan\u2019s name also featured in bogus allegations from Beech, aka Nick.\n\nSir Richard said Mr Rodhouse laid himself open to accusations that he deliberately kept Lord Brittan as a suspect on one probe to prop up the other.\n\nHe became head of Vincente in July 2014, four months before taking over Operation Midland. He kept the rape inquiry into Lord Brittan going even after the peer died in January 2015.\n\nSir Richard said: \u2018Whilst I do not assert that the DAC was deliberately retaining Lord Brittan as a suspect in Operation Vincente to bolster Operation Midland, by conducting himself as he did he exposed himself to such a suspicion. The question plainly arises to why the DAC should be so concerned to prolong an investigation into an allegation of sexual misconduct 48 years ago by a deceased man.\u2019\n\nIn the event, Lord Brittan was cleared. But only after his death.", "description": "Harvey Proctor claimed having overseen Surrey Police's 'mishandled inquiry' into Jimmy Savile, Steve Rodhouse (pictured) sought to use Carl Beech's claims 'as a form of redemption'.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/17/19336858-0-image-a-19_1570291506301.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
