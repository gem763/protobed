High rent is a direct violation of Gen Z\u2019s unofficial financial code.\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND: Young demonstrators hold placards as they attend a climate change protest organized by \"Youth Strike 4 Climate\", opposite the Houses of Parliament in central London on February 15, 2019.

Based on their collective size, Gen Z has the ability to shift the global population and the way we all work, live and play.\n\nHere\u2019s where these young adults should land, according to Nestpick\u2019s analysis.\n\nTop 25 cities for Gen Z\n\n1 - London, England\n\n2 - Stockholm, Sweden\n\n3 - Los Angeles, California\n\n4 - Toronto, Canada\n\n5 - New York, New York\n\nBERLIN, GERMANY: East Side Gallery is an outdoor art gallery located on a 1,316-meter section of the Berlin Wall, which were saved from demolition for that purpose.
