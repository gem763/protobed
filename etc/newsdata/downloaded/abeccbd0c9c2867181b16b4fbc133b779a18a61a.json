And then the back nine, I got a few close to the holes where those birdies came easier.\n\n\"So it just was a very easy 63 if you can somehow say that, but hopefully we'll be able to keep some of that going for the weekend.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old rated the 63 he registered two years ago at the tournament as better than Friday's round.\n\n\"I'll take 63 on any conditions on any course any day, but it was very, very benign out there,\" Thomas said. \"There just wasn't very much wind, which made it a lot easier to score.\n\n\"I felt like when I had control of the ball like I did today, it made it quite a bit easier.\"\n\nAmerican Jordan Spieth (65) and Emiliano Grillo (66) of Argentina were tied for fourth, four strokes behind Thomas in the first tournament of PGA Tour's three-event Asian swing.\n\nThe Tour next heads to Japan for the inaugural Zozo Championship before moving to China for the WGC-HSBC Champions.\n\nBrooks Koepka's title defence appeared to be wilting with the American world number one recording a three-over 75 in the second round and falling 13 strokes behind the leader.
