Alex Ellinghausen\n\n\u201cWe need to be embedding fairness into the financial system and avoiding harm.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory shift, overseen by ASIC deputy chair and veteran public policy economist Karen Chester, has embraced behavioural economics to underpin the new regulatory toolkit.\n\nIt is a recognition financial markets are inherently complex, consumers have cognitive biases and firms compete for people's attention through advertising blitzes.\n\nChester says unnecessary complexity, or \u201csludge\u201d, are getting in way of consumers making sensible decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiberal MP and free marketeer Jason Falinski \u201cloves\u201d behavioural economics and says \u201cthis is a massive step in the right direction by ASIC\u201d.\n\nBut Falinksi also sees shortcomings, with ASIC edging away from personal responsibility to put more onus on firms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the role of the Parliament, the regulator or the corporation who can or cannot buy their product,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cConsumers need to have sovereignty over the decisions they make.\u201d\n\n'Not going far enough'\n\nWhile applauding ASIC\u2019s admission that disclosure has failed, he is also worried the regulator is not prepared to fully rip the Band-Aid off and is instead layering a new regime on top of the broken disclosure system.\n\n\u201cThe issue is ASIC is not going far enough in sweeping disclosure away and it is building on top of a system that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Falinski says.\n\nNevertheless, in a strange sort of way the embrace of consumer psychology in economic regulation is in line with Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s demands of the public service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorrison wants the bureaucracy to be less of an ivory tower, by delivering for Australians in practical ways and being responsive to how people behave in the real world.\n\nThis is an important first step in developing a truly human-centric solution. \u2014 Dilip Soman, University of Toronto\n\nDilip Soman, Canada research chair in behavioural science and economics at the University of Toronto, says many countries focus on disclosure and financial literacy for consumers, but \"we should also think about a bit of human literacy for the financial services industry\".\n\n\"This is an important first step in developing a truly human-centric solution,\" he says of ASIC's report.\n\nBefore Morrison was elevated to prime minister, the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government inside the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had been trying to \u201cnudge\u201d consumers and taxpayers towards their own interests.\n\nThere are 10 behavioural insights teams across the federal government, including at the Australian Taxation Office, the Health Department and ASIC.\n\nA recent joint government-Westpac study found that repayments rose by about 28 per cent, or $134 on average, after 24,000 credit card holders received a text message reminding them that their bill was due. Email reminders had no effect.\n\nPrime Minister and Cabinet deputy secretary David Gruen said in his Canada-Australia Public Policy Initiative Lecture in Ottawa last month that requiring financial advisers to disclose to their clients conflicts of interest such as product sales commissions should raise consumer suspicions of advice from conflicted advisers. It should provide an incentive for advisers to reduce or eliminate their conflicts of interest so their advice will be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut real-world behavioural economics suggests the issue runs much deeper.\n\nGruen cites the analysis of Cornell University psychologist Sunita Sah, whose work was commissioned by the Hayne royal commission and who has interacted with ASIC and the PM's department.\n\nSah found disclosures can cause clients to feel social pressure to follow conflicted advice. Clients can become concerned that declining to follow the advice would signal distrust in their adviser, with whom they have often formed a personal bond.\n\nSah tells AFR Weekend via email she is delighted ASIC is moving away from a heavy reliance on disclosure.\n\n\"Disclosures can paradoxically increase trust in the provider\u2019s expertise, especially when consumers are distracted with competing information,\" she says.\n\n\"The opposite effect may also occur, in which disclosures make consumers sceptical and therefore prone to reject even high quality advice.\n\n\"Eliminating as many conflicts of interest as possible and aligning incentives for financial advisers and consumers will help improve advice quality and protect consumers.\"\n\nThe ASIC-Dutch regulator report found that when conflicted advisers gave bad advice and the conflict was disclosed, 81 per cent of people still followed the advice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong other key findings in the report, only two in five Australians given a key fact sheet for insurance objectively selected the best product, with 60 per cent picking suboptimal insurance.\n\nTwo-thirds of people were not able to locate all relevant investment fund fees and less than half could identify all super fund fees.\n\nAbout 86 per cent of local consumers assessed the quality of financial advice to be good, in contrast to 39 per cent of the same advice being independently rated as poor.\n\nAnd superannuation dashboards \u2013 intended to provide a simple snapshot summary of a super product on a fund's website \u2013 were found to be \"vulnerable to manipulation\".\n\nConsumer choice could be \u201cmanipulated\u201d by relabelling or reweighting asset allocation information used in diagrams, ASIC said.\n\nAt least in the case of complex financial services, the economic textbook theory of the rational consumer has been found wanting.", "description": "The regulator insists \u201cbuyer beware\u201d has not been abandoned.
