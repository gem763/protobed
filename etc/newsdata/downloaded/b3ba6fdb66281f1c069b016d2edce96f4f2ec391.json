According to preliminary research presented at the UK National Cancer Research Institute\u2019s (NCRI) 2016 conference, one in six women who discovered their cancer themselves caught it based on a less-obvious breast cancer symptom, like nipple abnormalities and weight loss (a.k.a. not a lump).\n\nThese self-reported breast cancers \u2014 especially ones that don\u2019t involve the typical lump \u2014 highlight why it\u2019s so important to pay attention to any strange signs or symptoms or changes you may be experiencing, in addition to staying on top of your mammograms and annual checkups, says Dr Neelima Denduluri, the associate chair of the U.S. Oncology Network Breast Committee.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s best to examine your breasts as a whole \u2014 keeping track of what they normally feel and look like \u2014 so you can report any changes to your doc, whether they\u2019re cancer or not, she adds.\n\nHere are some of the most surprising signs and symptoms of breast cancer in women, so you know what to look out for besides lumps:\n\n1. You notice dimply, scaly, patchy, or inflamed skin\n\nYou know your boobs and all their little quirks (like how Leftie fills out your bra so much better than Rightie) so if you notice any changes to their normal appearance, pay attention, says Dr Debra Patt, ob-gyn and breast cancer expert with Texas Oncology, a practice in the US Oncology Network.\n\n\u201cAny unusual thickening, redness, rash, dimpling, or puckering of your breast skin, or around the nipple, should be checked out by your doctor,\u201d she explains.\n\nREAD MORE: What Exactly Are \u2018Dense Breasts\u2019?\n\n2. Your nipples have changed\n\nOnly mannequins have perfect, pointy, well-behaved nipples. Real, human women have to deal with different colours and sizes, positions, textures, and (gasp) hair.\n\nFortunately, all of these things are totally normal and not a problem as long as they\u2019re your normal, says Dr Denduluri. For example, if your nips have always been inverted, that\u2019s just how you\u2019re shaped, but if they change suddenly, going from pointy to fully or partially inverted, call your doctor stat. Any change in your nipples, including their colour and texture, needs to be checked to rule out cancer, she says.\n\nOh, and BTW, hairy nipples on women have nothing to do with cancer and are totally normal\u2014one in three women have nipple hair, even if they won\u2019t admit it, she adds.\n\n3. Or, your nipples are leaking\n\nIs there anything more alarming than having your breasts start squirting liquid when there\u2019s no baby involved? \u201cIt\u2019s normal to have some leakage during pregnancy, while breastfeeding, and up to a year after weaning your baby, but if you notice any discharge any other time it needs to be evaluated by a doctor,\u201d says Dr Patt.\n\nRandom discharge, especially if it\u2019s red or green or has an odour, can mean you have a problem, including cancer of the breast or the pituitary gland, she explains.\n\n4. You\u2019ve got painful swelling\n\nSwollen and painful breasts are, well, a pain \u2014 and while they\u2019re mainly due to hormonal changes (like PMS or pregnancy), they can be linked to breast cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the size and placement of the tumour, says Dr Patt, which can be responsible for a change in the size or shape of your breast, or cause of painful swelling. While the vast majority of women who report breast pain do not have cancer, if breast pain and swelling isn\u2019t linked to your menstrual cycle, you\u2019re not breastfeeding, and it appears suddenly or doesn\u2019t go away, give your doctor a call because whatever is happening needs to be addressed, adds Dr Patt.\n\nREAD MORE: Exactly What To Do If You Notice A Lump In Your Breast\n\n5. You feel a strange tickling sensation\n\nHow your breasts feel internally can be just as important as how they feel on the outside, says Dr Sherry Ross, an ob-gyn and author of She-ology. Some women report feeling a sensation almost like they\u2019re being \u201ctickled from the inside,\u201d their breast feels like it\u2019s \u201cbuzzing\u201d or \u201cprickly\u201d inside, or like their breast milk is \u201cletting down\u201d (when they\u2019re not breastfeeding), she says.\n\nWeird feelings can happen for no reason at all but if you\u2019re experiencing strange sensations in your breast that are abnormal and recurring, it\u2019s time to call your doc, she says.\n\n6. You can\u2019t face the stream in the shower\n\nDoes wearing a bra suddenly irritate your nipples? Are your breasts so painful that you have to face away from the stream of water in the shower? Have your breasts become so sensitive that you don\u2019t like your partner to touch them anymore? Breasts or nipples that become more sensitive than normal can be a sign of cancer, Dr Ross says.\n\nBreast sensitivity is often tied to hormone changes, which is why many women experience breast tenderness as part of PMS and it\u2019s one of the earliest signs of pregnancy. \u201cHowever, some types of breast cancer can affect your hormones, giving you a similar feeling,\u201d she explains.\n\nSo if your breasts are suddenly way more sensitive than normal and it\u2019s not around that time of the month and you\u2019re not pregnant, give your doctor a call, she says.\n\n7. Your boobs look really veiny\n\nBeing able to see your veins on the surface of your breasts depends on a lot of things \u2014 skin color, amount of subcutaneous fat, pregnancy, genetics \u2014 but you should be paying attention to those squiggly blue or green lines as changes in their appearance can be an early sign of breast cancer, Dr. Ross says.\n\nBeing veiny in general is nothing to be concerned about, but if you\u2019ve never been able to see them before and now you can, or if they\u2019ve suddenly become much bigger, darker, or more prominent, then it\u2019s time to be concerned. \u201cVisible veins can indicate the presence of a tumour as they require more blood flow and therefore more veins,\u201d she explains. \u201cOr the tumour may be blocking the blood flow, causing the veins nearby to swell.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Why Do My Nipples Hurt?!\n\n8. You can\u2019t stop itching your nipples\n\nSometimes the girls just need a good scratch, especially if you\u2019re wearing a bra edged with lace or sequins. (Why, bra manufacturers, why?) But if your nips are constantly itchy there\u2019s a good possibility something else is up and you need to get them checked, Dr Patt says.\n\nMany things can cause itchy nipples, including a yeast infection or other infection, allergies, and irritation from clothing. But there is a rare type of breast cancer that can cause a dry, red, itchy rash to appear on or around your nipples, similar to the type you get with eczema, she explains.\n\nRegardless of the cause, an itchy rash is one symptom you should always have your doctor take a look at, particularly if it doesn\u2019t go away after a week or two.\n\n9. Your armpit is sore (and you didn\u2019t do pushups)\n\nFun fact: Your breast tissue extends far past the circular (boobular?) part you stick in your bra cups. \u201cYour breasts actually go along the side of your chest and up into your armpits,\u201d Dr Ross explains. You can get breast cancer in this bonus boob tissue or cancer can cause lymph nodes in your armpit area to swell, she says. So if your armpits become painful or swollen \u2014 and you didn\u2019t go overboard on the chest press machine \u2014 or you feel a mass when shaving, give your doc a call.\n\nArmpit discomfort is a common complaint and most of the time it\u2019s nothing to worry about but it\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your breasts (and pits), Ross says.\n\n10. You have a zit that won\u2019t heal\n\nDidn\u2019t know that you can get zits on your breasts? It\u2019s true. It\u2019s not uncommon to get small sores, including pimples and even warts, on your breasts or nipples, Dr Ross says. In women who workout, you may find them in places you sweat heavily, like between your breasts, or along the line of your sports bra where sweat can get trapped and clog your pores.\n\nMost zits will go away on their own with time and good hygiene. But if you\u2019ve got a small sore of any type that doesn\u2019t go away after a week or two, it\u2019s worth it to get it checked out. \u201cHaving sores or bruises that won\u2019t heal can be an early sign of cancer,\u201d she explains.\n\n11. You notice changes that aren\u2019t related to your boobs at all\n\nBack pain, neck pain, and unexplained weight loss were all listed as other breast cancer symptoms that led women to seek medical care and ultimately get diagnosed with breast cancer, according to the NCRI study.\n\nThat\u2019s because breast cancer can spread before it\u2019s caught, causing symptoms in body parts that have nothing to do with your boobs. It\u2019s not possible to identify every possible sign of breast cancer (or, rather, that list would be way too long to be meaningful) so when it comes to early detection, you are your own best weapon, says Dr Denduluri. Overall, any persistent, noticeable change should be checked by a doctor.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Nipples looking weird all of a sudden?", "authors": ["Charlotte Hilton Andersen"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3171/ed23cf87371443b081447dfe2e971971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
