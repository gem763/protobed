Energy levels might be low with the quick turnaround but there are players jumping out of their skin to play.\"\n\nWilliams, meanwhile, called for a candidate with Pacific island or Maori blood to be considered for the All Blacks coaching set-up.\n\n\"There are going to be a few guys putting their hands up,\" said Williams, who is of Samoan heritage.\n\n\"I'd like to see a Pacific Islander or a Maori in the coaching system that would have a bit of influence,\" he added. \"There's a lot of Island boys, a lot of Maori boys playing for the All Blacks -- there's a lot of space there for that growth.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "New Zealand icon Sonny Bill Williams said Monday that the All Blacks players needed \"bulletproof vests\" during a brutal analysis of their devastating 19-7 World Cup semifinal defeat by England.
