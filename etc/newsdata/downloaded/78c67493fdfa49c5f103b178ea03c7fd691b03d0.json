The plot was foiled, however, and Abdulmutallab is now serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison in Colorado after pleading guilty to multiple terrorism charges.\n\nThis undated file photo released Oct. 31, 2010, by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Interior purports to show Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri.

The United States will continue to hunt down terrorists like al-Asiri until they no longer pose a threat to our great Nation,\" the White House said.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration's full body scanners were implemented to spot threats such as the underwear bomb designed by Al-Asiri.\n\nContributing: Jay Cannon, USA TODAY\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Ibrahim al-Asiri, 2009 Christmas Day underwear bomb maker, killed", "description": "The confessed terrorist crafted a bomb that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab wore aboard a Detroit-bound airplane on Christmas Day in 2009.", "authors": ["Tresa Baldas", "Detroit Free Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pfr9R3SGbpxEDjbtuJJX4A--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MTM3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/628459cdc6e3f224f7aaa2e8f500517a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
