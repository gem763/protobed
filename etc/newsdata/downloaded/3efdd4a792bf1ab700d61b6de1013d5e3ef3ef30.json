If true, Secretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry. He should immediately cease intimidating department witnesses in order to protect himself and the president,\" the three chairmen wrote.\n\nState official speaks\n\nThe State Department's former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who abruptly stepped down last week, spent more than nine hours testifying Thursday on Capitol Hill. In the closed-door meeting, lawmakers discovered that diplomats managing the U.S. relationship with Ukraine spent weeks trying to persuade the Ukranian government to announce it would open investigations into Burisma, an energy company that hired Joe Biden's son Hunter in 2014.\n\nVolker also revealed in his testimony that with the guidance of President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, he and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, worked on a statement for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to commit Ukraine to pursue the investigations.\n\n\"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" wrote William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, to Sonland in a text exchange revealed Thursday night.\n\nEarlier in the day, President Trump openly admitted that he wanted Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter when pressed by a reporter about what he hoped would happen after a July 25 call with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\"I would think if they were honest about it they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Face the Nation\" Guest Lineup:\n\nForeign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep.
