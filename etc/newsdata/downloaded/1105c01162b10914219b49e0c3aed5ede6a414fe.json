Eggshell is formed from calcium carbonate and special proteins that help confer strength to the shell. In a typical laying hen, for example, it takes around 20 hours to form a shell. Pigmentation is added to the outside of the shell by special structures in the bird's oviducts. As eggs are normally lain blunt-end-first, this side is normally subjected to more pressure \u2014 and therefore stronger colours \u2014 on its journey. Birds that lay their eggs in open nests and in colder climate tend to have darker eggshells.\n\nThe possible drivers of egg colours are varied and contradictory.\n\nFor example, dark pigments tend to absorb more heat than their lighter counterparts, which could suggest dark eggs would be favoured in cooler regions.\n\nOn the other hand, darker eggs better shield against harmful UV rays, which are typically more intense in warmer regions.\n\nThey also have stronger anti-microbial properties, which are more useful in warmer climates \u2014 together suggesting the opposite might hold true.\n\nSimilarly, one might expect the conspicuous nature of lighter eggs to be a disadvantage in warmer regions, where predators tend to be more abundant.\n\nTo settle the matter, biologist Phillip Wisocki of the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University and colleagues measured the brightness and colour of eggs, from 643 species of birds, preserved in the collection of various natural history museums.\n\nThe authors then mapped these colourations onto each species' known geographic breeding area \u2014 and found a pattern.\n\n'Birds living in cold habitats, particularly those with nests exposed to incident solar radiation, have darker eggs,' the researchers wrote in their paper.\n\nIn contrast, eggs lain in warmer climes, or in cavities or enclosed nests tended to be lighter in colour.\n\nNext, the team exposed chicken, duck and quail eggs \u2014 which various colours and brightnesses \u2014 to direct sunlight.\n\nThey found that eggs with a darker pigmentation were able to maintain their incubation temperatures for longer periods of time than their lighter counterparts.\n\nResearchers measured the brightness and colour of eggs, from 643 species of birds, preserved in the collection of various natural history museums. The authors then mapped these colourations onto each species' known geographic breeding area, as pictured\n\n'Birds living in cold habitats, particularly those with nests exposed to incident solar radiation, have darker eggs,' the researchers wrote in their paper (stock image)\n\n'This evidence suggests that egg pigmentation could play an important role in thermoregulation in cold climates,' the researchers wrote.\n\nWhereas, they added, 'a range of competing selective pressures further influence eggshell colours in warmer climates.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Experts led from the Long Island University Post  measured the brightness and colour of eggs, from 643 species of birds, preserved in the collection of various natural history museums.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20286798-0-image-a-56_1572279096630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
