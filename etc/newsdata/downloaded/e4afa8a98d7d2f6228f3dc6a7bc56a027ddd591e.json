Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,\u2019 said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways? Yeah.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nFight night in Ohio - Politico: \u201cBernie Sanders is recovering from his heart attack. Joe Biden is under siege, and laying into Donald Trump. And the entire Democratic presidential field has become consumed with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. With so many candidates responding to circumstances beyond their control \u2014 and the threat of a destabilizing moment running high on a stage that\u2019s expanding to 12 candidates from 10 \u2014 it\u2019s raising the specter of a debate Tuesday that finally breaks the Democratic primary logjam. Not only is it the first debate since Sanders was hospitalized and the impeachment inquiry began, it also comes as many lower-polling candidates become increasingly desperate to make a mark on the campaign. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week, Biden acknowledged how much of the debate is out of any candidate's hands. \u2026 Biden said, \u2018One of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nWill Buttigieg throw elbows? - Politico: \u201cPete Buttigieg sees a path to the top tier of the Democratic primary field, elbowing his way between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one side and Joe Biden on the other. At the center of Buttigieg\u2019s push is his health care plan, which the South Bend, Ind., mayor has dubbed \u2018Medicare for all who want it.\u2019 The plan would extend a public health insurance option to Americans without ending the private insurance market, an effect of the plan put forward by Sanders and endorsed by Warren. \u2026 Buttigieg also argued that his health care plan is tougher on insurance providers than Biden\u2019s own public option proposal to build on Obamacare. \u2018It turns out that setting up the exchanges has not been enough to empower all Americans to have good coverage,\u2019 Buttigieg said.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeto says he need to \u2018break through\u2019 - Texas Tribune: \u201cDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced Friday as he acknowledged it was more urgent than ever to \u2018break through\u2019 in the still-crowded primary. The third-quarter total is an improvement over the $3.6 million that the former El Paso congressman took in during the previous quarter, and it came despite a halt to fundraising for roughly two weeks in August after the deadly El Paso shooting. Still, the total puts him behind a majority of primary rivals who have released their third-quarter figures so far, including two leading candidates who each raised around $25 million.\u201d\n\n\n\nBloomberg back to floating trial balloons - CNBC: \u201cMike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden\u2019s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That\u2019s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private. Bloomberg has signaled he\u2019s \u2018still looking at\u2019 running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden\u2019s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run.\u201d\n\n\n\nDems on edge over cyberattacks - Politico: \u201cThe Democratic National Committee sent an urgent alert on Monday to every presidential campaign aimed at avoiding a repeat of the cybersecurity fiasco the party suffered at the hands of Russia and Wikileaks in 2016. The subject of the email was \u2018Counter-Disinformation Update,\u2019 and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party\u2019s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats. POLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC\u2019s Tech\u2019s missives to the presidential campaigns. They reveal a party struggling to combat the continued onslaught of the twin threats faced by the Democratic Party: cyber penetration from state actors abroad and the spread of disinformation about its top presidential candidates by Donald Trump and his allies at home. \u2026 It was a moment, the DNC warned, to be hyper vigilant about fake news.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeven years later, Warren changes tune on health care - Politico: \u201cSeven years before Elizabeth Warren said \u2018I\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for All,\u2019 she was campaigning for the Senate and didn\u2019t want to talk about single-payer health care. Running a tough race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown, the first-time candidate repeatedly distanced herself from the idea. \u2026 But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she \u2026 dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time. \u2026 Warren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the \u2018most obvious\u2019 solution to the nation's health care woes \u2014 though perhaps \u2018politically unacceptable.\u2019 Warren\u2019s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren strong in Q Poll, but still lags on electability - Quinnipiac University: \u201cOne day before the next Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the top spot in the Democratic primary, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 27 percent.. \u2026 However, on the question of electability - which candidate has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump - Biden retains his commanding lead with 48 percent saying he has the best chance, compared to 49 percent in August. While still trailing Biden, Warren has increased her support from 9 percent in August to 21 percent today. No other candidate gets into double digits.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: K, BYE\n\n\u201cAnd here let us not forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to persuade or compel them to depart.\u201d \u2013 John Jay, Federalist No. 5\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: TO THE HOLY LAND\n\nSmithsonian: \u201cOn April 1483, a German politician named Bernhard von Breydenbach embarked on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Breydenbach and his companions\u2014among others, Dutch artist Erhard Reuwich\u2014traveled at a leisurely clip, touring destinations including Venice, Corfu, Modon and Rhodes while en route. Two years after his pilgrimage, Breydenbach created an illustrated guide detailing the farflung locales he had visited on his trip. The text, titled Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, or A Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was an instant sensation, with eleven editions in six languages published between 1486 and 1505. Now, one of the few surviving first editions of Breydenbach\u2019s \u201815th-century bestseller\u2019 is set to go on view at the British Museum\u2026 Giulia Bartrum, curator of German prints at the British Museum, [says] that prior to the text\u2019s publication, \u2018most of the depictions of places such as Jerusalem or Venice were totally made up.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\n\nBiden: 28.2 points (\u2191 1 point from last wk.)\n\nWarren: 26.4 points (\u2191 1.8 points from last wk.)\n\nSanders: 13.4 points (\u2193 1.2 points from last wk.)\n\nButtigieg: 6.2 points (no change in points from last wk.)\n\nHarris: 4.4 points (\u2193 0.2 points from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, Fox News, IBD, Monmouth University and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\n\nAverage approval: 42.6 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 53.8 percent\n\nNet Score: -11.2 percent\n\nChange from one week ago: \u2191 1.8 points\n\n[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 45% approve - 51% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels where she reportedly raised concerns about a July 10 meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the \u2018investigation that could implicate Biden and his son.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nGiuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - Reuters: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump\u2019s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. Giuliani said Parnas\u2019 company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients \u2018reduce and mitigate fraud\u2019, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee\u2019s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nFeds dig deeper - WSJ: \u201cFederal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators also have examined Giuliani\u2019s bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Giuliani\u2019s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates, the people said. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn\u2019t been informed of any investigation. \u2018They can look at my Ukraine business all they want,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\n\n\nDems return from recess more united on impeachment - WaPo: \u201c\u2026Just days after suddenly embracing an impeachment inquiry of President Trump \u2014 a moment of seeming political crisis \u2014 House leaders sent lawmakers home for their scheduled two-week recess. But as Congress returns to work Tuesday, fears of lost momentum, internal dissension and dissipating interest in impeachment have mostly evaporated among House Democrats, who view the past two weeks as among the most damaging to Trump as they dig in for their constitutional showdown with the president. \u2026 But on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nWSJ Editorial Board: \u2018Trump\u2019s Syria Mess\u2019 - WSJ\n\n\n\nLowey retirement creates battle for top spot on House Appropriations - Roll Call\n\n\n\nPergram: Trump called for Romney's impeachment in tweet, but could that actually happen? - Fox News\n\n\n\nAUDIBLE: OOF\n\n\u201cIt took me four months to get the five-inch heel out of my ass.\u201d \u2013 Rep.

After a fall, Marie went to live at a rehab facility. It would be the first marathon she would not be out cheering for the runners. That's when her neighbors stepped in. \u2018We felt it very important to get her out of there for the day and bring her back to the tradition that she started,\u2019 said Sean Osborne of Archbald. Wrapped in a blanket with a space heater for extra warmth, Marie was on Laurel Street with her neighbors as runners passed by. And while she says she is no longer in charge, her neighbors know she still calls the shots. \u2026 \u2018It's exciting! It puts life in our bones,\u2019 Marie said.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cStem-cell research will one day be a boon to humanity. We owe it to posterity to pursue it.
