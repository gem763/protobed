Now astronomers may know where it came from.", "language": "en", "text": "In October 2017, astronomers detected a strange, cigar-shaped object passing through our solar system.\n\nThe object, called 'Oumuamua, is a comet from another star system.\n\nA team of astronomers compared the path of 'Oumuamua through space to the motions of millions of stars to try and figure out where it came from.\n\nThe team found four possible candidate stars for the interstellar comet's home, but they say the search is not over.\n\nAfter a Hawaiian telescope spotted an object called 'Oumuamua flying through space in October 2017, astronomers realised it was weird.\n\nVery weird.\n\n\n\nThe object had a cigar-like shape and was about 230- by 35 metre in size, or roughly as large as a skyscraper. It was dark red in colour and moving inexplicably fast. Just in case, one group of astronomers even scanned it for alien radio emissions (yet heard nothing).\n\nMost importantly, 'Oumuamua wasn't circling the sun like a typical space rock. Instead, it had dived between Mercury and the sun, swooped below our home star, and was zooming past Earth on its way out of our solar system.\n\nThis showed that 'Oumuamua \u2014 whose name means \"a messenger from afar, arriving first\" in Hawaiian \u2014 was actually an interstellar traveller from beyond the solar system.\n\nAstronomers eventually determined 'Oumuamua wasn't an asteroid but instead a \"mildly active\" comet.\n\nBut if it is not from our solar system, then where did it come from?\n\nUsing the latest and most precise star map ever created, eight astronomers have located four stars that are candidates for 'Oumuamua's home. Each star's path in relatively recent history matches somewhat closely to the comet's calculated path.\n\nTheir study, highlighted on Tuesday in a European Space Agency (ESA) press release, was recently accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal, a peer-reviewed science publication.\n\nHow the team found candidate homes for 'Oumuamua\n\nThe research team began its search with an unprecedented map of 1.7 billion stars created by an ESA spacecraft called Gaia. The new map, released in April, is the second major Gaia dataset published by the ESA since the spacecraft launched in December 2013.\n\nThe map doesn't just note the position of the stars, though: It also shows where stars are moving through space and how fast.\n\nAbout 7 million stars in Gaia's database have motion data that is detailed enough to let astronomers precisely \"rewind\" their positions to millions of years in the past.\n\nBy comparing the historic path of 'Oumuamua against these millions of stellar paths, the team discovered four candidates which line up within a few light-years of the comet. One of these star systems may have ejected 'Oumuamua toward Earth, likely via a giant planet early in the system's formation.\n\nAll of the candidates are dwarf stars, which means they are small and burn very hot. Two were already named (HD 292249 and HIP 3757) and two others were temporarily named by the team (\"home-3\" and \"home-4\").\n\nThe closest match to the path of 'Oumuamua was with the dwarf star HIP 3757. The paths of the star and wayward comet came within two light-years of each other some 1 million years or so ago.\n\nSo, as of right now, this star may be the best candidate yet for where 'Oumuamua hails from. But astronomers are hardly satisfied with that answer.\n\nWhy the search is not over\n\nThe researchers behind the new study aren't confident they've found 'Oumuamua's home.\n\nFor one, Gaia's latest and most detailed sample of 7 million stars \u2014 while vast \u2014 is only partial. Some 180 million stars exist closer to Earth than the ones examined by the research team.\n\n\"Hence it is [therefore] unlikely that we would find the home system in our study,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe team also looked for encounters within the past few million years. In reality, 'Oumuamua may have travelled much farther and longer before reaching our solar system \u2014 perhaps tens of millions of years or more, the authors said.\n\nIn addition, the four stars pinpointed by the search aren't yet known to harbour any planets, let alone worlds large enough to kick 'Oumuamua all the way to Earth.\n\nFinally, the speed of 'Oumuamua is better explained by a two-star (or binary) system, yet none of the four systems described by the study have more than one star in them.\n\nThe astronomers behind the work are waiting for Gaia's third star map to be released. Those data should describe the ultra-precise motions of 10 times as many nearby stars as the team looked at for their study \u2014 perhaps including the one from which our interstellar visitor originated.\n\n\"The search for 'Oumuamua's home continues,\" the authors said.", "description": "Scientists believe it's a comet that was kicked out of another star system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2387/4500677746c34f889ef1109db4137681.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-27"}
