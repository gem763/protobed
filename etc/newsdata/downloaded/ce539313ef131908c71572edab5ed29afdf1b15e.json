Apple will launch a low-cost phone next year: report", "language": "en", "text": "Apple is expected to announce a raft of devices next week but not a budget iPhone \u2013 that won\u2019t happen until next year, says a new report.\n\nThe cheap phone, expected next spring, would be a successor to the $399 iPhone SE, according to the report from Nikkei. That tiny 4-inch iPhone sold well but was discontinued by Apple in September 2018.\n\nThe size of the new model \u201cwill be similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone 8\u201d introduced in 2017, sources told Nikkei. And the new model model will share many of the same components with Apple\u2019s flagship iPhones.\n\nApple will cut costs by using an LCD (liquid crystal display) instead of the pricier OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display used on its top-of-the-line iPhones, Nikkei said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a cinch that new version of the iPhone SE would be a hit.\n\nAPPLE'S IPHONE 11 EVENT: WHAT TO EXPECT\n\n\u201cThe iPhone SE was relatively popular,\u201d Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst with market researcher IDC, told Fox News. \u201cBut the market has changed substantially since then. Today, a smaller screen size isn\u2019t exciting anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nApple needs a device to stem its market share loss. Apple shipped 33.8 million new iPhones during the second quarter of 2019, which \u201cwas down significantly from the same quarter a year ago,\u201d IDC said in a recent report.\n\nIPHONE HACK ATTACK: GOOGLE SAYS HACKERS PLACED 'MONITORING IMPLANTS' IN IPHONES\n\nAnd Chinese phone maker Huawei has shot up to No.2 in global smartphone shipments, a spot Apple once held.\n\nThe Apple event next week, however, could give Apple a boost and iPhone users a reason to upgrade. The tech giant is expected to launch three new iPhones next Tuesday.\n\nThe main attraction at the event is expected to be the flagship iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The iPhone 11 Pro is expected to feature a new triple camera lens technology and next-generation AI.\n\nThose phones will be pricey, though. For example, Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone XS phones now start at $999, the price of a decent laptop.\n\nMorgan Stanley, in a recent research note, believes strong interest in new iPhones won\u2019t happen until a future 5G iPhone arrives.", "description": "Apple is expected to announce a raft of devices next week but not a budget iPhone \u2013 that won\u2019t happen until next year, says a new report.", "authors": ["Brooke Crothers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/iphone-se-edit_apple.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
