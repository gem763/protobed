A few have come my way over two decades of reporting, but the one that woke me in the summer of 2006 left a mark.\n\nI was staying at the Tropicana in Las Vegas, having flown in late the night before to cover a United Auto Workers convention amid the American car business\u2019s rapid decline.\n\nPaul Ingrassia, then the executive running the company\u2019s Dow Jones Newswires, was on the other end of the line from the East Coast, calling from three hours in the future. He wanted to know if I\u2019d seen the New York Times business section. I\u2019d been scooped on a story about the UAW leadership\u2019s plans. The brief call sent a clear message: We sent you to Sin City to work. Get moving.\n\n\u2018Paul mastered the art of impatience,\u2019 said his younger brother, Larry Ingrassia.

Join the conversation below.\n\nPaul died Monday at 69, and that led to a flood of stories online and in print about his legacy as a newsman, leader and gearhead. Memories could fill several weeks worth of columns, but the leadership lesson he left fills one line.\n\n\u201cPaul mastered the art of impatience,\u201d his younger brother, Larry, told me.\n\nWinning requires belief in a cause and disdain for the red tape and naysaying\u2014or a good night\u2019s sleep\u2014that gets in the way. Paul had no appetite for what many consider the necessary evils in business.\n\nFor instance, more than once I was on an email chain that he was copied on. These conversations can continue on message after message, with multiple people weighing in on whether we should do the story, who should do the story, what the story line should be.\n\nThe response from Mr. Ingrassia inevitably went like this: For the amount of words and time we\u2019ve wasted talking about the story, we could have had it published by now.\n\nGordon Crovitz, a former Wall Street Journal publisher, said if executives signaled support for an Ingrassia initiative, he would go in for the kill even as others were still thinking it over.\n\n\u201cHe was a master of the presumptive close,\u201d Mr. Crovitz remembered. \u201cHe would say, \u2018Are we going to announce this on Tuesday or Thursday?\u2019 It forced more urgent discussion.\u201d\n\nI owe much of my career to Paul\u2019s ability to accompany his high bar, direct feedback and sense of urgency with consistent gestures that showed he gave a damn about me and thousands of others under his care. I\u2019ve chased CEOs, heads of state and even the pope around the U.S. and Europe, and it is a rare bird who cares as much about the success of others as they do about their own.\n\nPaul started his career Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, in the Journal\u2019s Chicago bureau in 1977, the same year I was born. I was hired as a Dow Jones Newswires reporter 28 years into Paul\u2019s tenure. By then, he\u2019d collected a Pulitzer Prize for covering the troubled American car industry and was several years into his stint running the wire service.\n\nMy first day in the Detroit bureau came with a surprise visit from Paul. I had never met him before when he asked me tag along to lunch with a top auto executive.\n\nAs we ate, the executive started spitting out news. Paul nodded toward my notebook, his trademark grimace indicating I should put down my fork and pick up my pen.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, shakes hands with Paul Ingrassia in 2015.

The last time I heard his voice was when I was reporting a piece on Lee Iacocca\u2019s death this summer. Paul told me that cancer he had battled for years had returned, but figured he\u2019d beat it again. Then we talked about the former Chrysler boss and K-Cars and government bailouts for God knows how long.\n\nPaul, who chronicled the epic downfall of General Motors , was allergic to anything that smacked of unnecessary bureaucracy, whether it was born from laziness, an unwillingness to change or hubris.\n\nIt showed up in his last great battle at Dow Jones, pushing for the integration of the Newswires and Journal news-gathering operations. Paul agitated to elevate the stature of the Newswires\u2019 journalists, who often played second fiddle to the Journal colleagues.\n\nIt never happened in Paul\u2019s time at the company, but today, after much cultural angst, the two newsrooms are one.\n\nHe retired from Dow Jones management in 2007 and wrote books for awhile. His goal with \u201cCrash Course\u201d was to publish the first book on the bailouts of GM and Chrysler. He talked the Journal into allowing me to help him rush the project even while I remained a beat reporter. I later followed him to Reuters, a Journal competitor, after I took a brief detour into public relations.\n\nA short time into my Reuters career, I told him that the Journal wanted me back to run its Scandinavia bureau. Paul knew where my heart was. He practically pushed me out of the door, telling me it was the job of a lifetime.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be my best friend in Stockholm,\u201d he said.", "description": "Need better efforts on short timetables?
