She was sniffing around for somebody.\"\n\nPassengers kept Olive on the bus, stopping her from getting off because they were worried she might have been hit by a car.\n\nMs Burton said it was a \"shock\" that so many websites had republished her picture.\n\n\"I would like her to be reunited with her owner if they're missing her or put into the loving home she deserves,\" she said.\n\nWhen the bus reached Bradford Interchange, Olive was collected by a dog warden and taken to Cliffe Kennels, near Barnsley.\n\nOwner Denise Ball said \"a lot\" of people had got in touch about Olive who will go to a new home in the \"very near future\".\n\nShe said: \"There's only going to be one lucky person out of the inundation of calls but if they're all serious about giving a dog a good home then they should go to one of Yorkshire's bona fide rescue centres and take another dog.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
