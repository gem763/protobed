At the same time, 45 percent of all adult Americans said they support impeachment while 39 percent oppose it, unchanged from last week.\n\nRELATIONS RAW\n\nRelations between Democrats and Republicans in Congress were already raw when the State Department on Tuesday ordered U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a major Trump political donor, not to appear at a closed-door meeting of three U.S. House panels investigating Trump.\n\nDemocrats view Sondland as a key witness who could help shed light on whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine. Trump has alleged corruption by the Bidens, but has not provided any evidence to back that up.\n\nThe move prompted Democrats to accuse Trump of obstructing their investigation and Republicans to accuse Democrats of operating a secretive, biased inquiry.\n\nThe hot rhetoric in the high-stakes battle between Trump and Democrats who control the House is expected to intensify next week when Congress returns from a two-week recess.\n\nOn their return, members will huddle privately to discuss strategy if Pelosi decides in coming weeks or months to go ahead with articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would have no choice but to initiate a Senate trial on whether to convict Trump of any formal charges of \u201chigh crimes or misdemeanors\u201d lodged by the House.\n\nBut he added in an interview with CNBC: \u201cHow long you\u2019re on it, is a whole different matter,\u201d possibly referring to the right of any senator to move to dismiss the charges, thus short-circuiting a full-blown Senate trial and a vote on convicting Trump - if the motion were to be approved.\n\nRepublicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump.", "description": "The congressional committees leading the inquiry are finalizing arrangements to interview the whistleblower at the center of the investigation over Trump...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9dd02f200000da064fec0c.jpeg?cache=6k6mwilgnk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
