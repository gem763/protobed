(Santiago Bluguermann/Getty Images)\n\nColdplay are teasing new music and fans are excited it could mean the beginning of a new era for the band.\n\nThe band released their last album A Head Full Of Dreams in 2015, so it wouldn\u2019t be too surprising if we could expect a new record from the band anytime soon.\n\nPosting a short clip of what could be a new song today, that\u2019s what fans online are hoping.\n\nAlong with the clip, the band have posted a short video made to look like an old photograph with the date \u2018November 22, 1919\u2019 fading slowly into view on top of it.\n\nCould this mean the band are planning to a new album on 22nd November perhaps?\n\nAny philosophy nerds out there might also notice that the photo seems to feature the band sitting next to German philosopher Nietzsche, who died in 1900, holding a saxophone. Honestly, we\u2019re just as confused as you are\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018OH THAT IS BEAUTIFUL OH THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL,\u2019 one fan wrote in response to the band\u2019s post.\n\n\u2018JUST RELEASE THE DAMN SINGLE ALREADY,\u2019 wrote another.\n\nAnother added: \u2018finally! The 3 words half of the world population was waiting for: \u201cCOLDPLAY HAS TWEETED\u201d\u2019.\n\nIn 2016, Chris told Zane Lowe that there would be no more \u2018conventional Coldplay albums\u2019 after A Head Full Of Dreams, leading many to suspect that the band was announcing their retirement.\n\nBut last year they released an EP under the alias Los Unidades which featured the band\u2019s Chris Martin, Will Berryman, Guy Champion and Jonny Buckland are masquerading under a new name.\n\nThe band are reportedly planning to release two albums over the next few months \u2013 an album of \u2018experimental\u2019 material next month and another album in 2020.\n\nA source told The Daily Star: \u2018The first album is the more experimental side of Coldplay, they probably won\u2019t tour until 2020 when the next one arrives.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
