The beeb seriously need to sort their phone lines out. Unforgivable. #StrictlyResults \u2014 sarah \ud83d\ude0a (@_anothersarah) October 13, 2019\n\nSooooo phone lines weren't working for Dev\u2026 then he ends up in bottom two, the judges say they are shocked\u2026 and vote him off.\n\nHmmmmmmmmm?\n\n#Strictly pic.twitter.com/IIlCWFzoCd \u2014 Kerry Fitzgerald (@misskerryfitz) October 13, 2019\n\nWell I\u2019ve heard there was a phone line issue \ud83d\udcde \ud83e\udd14 but aside from that, I just don\u2019t understand how ALL the judges thought Dev was worse than Emma. But there you go. What do I know \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd28 #Strictly \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffc \u2014 Auntie Bex \u2728 (@Bexxy1976) October 13, 2019\n\nPeople are moaning about the lines being dead for Dev and Dianne but why didnt u vote online like i do. Its easy and its free #strictly \u2014 Ryan Glendenning (@ryanG_tweets) October 13, 2019\n\nI read on tweets earlier that people trying to vote for Dev were getting a message saying number unobtainable before the end of the voting. Maybe this should be looked into. #Strictly \u2014 Deborah (@kibby3005) October 13, 2019\n\n@bbcstrictly wrong result. Was unable to vote for @dev_101 last night as phone lines were faulty. #Strictly \u2014 Lincoln Sound Group (@Lincssoundgroup) October 13, 2019\n\n#Strictly that was so unfair you couldn\u2019t vote for Dev and Diane ,worse week ever and I have been a loyal follower for years. Absolutely ridiculous scores last night \ud83d\ude2a\ud83d\ude2a \u2014 Wendyjanedonachy (@janedonachy) October 13, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a week of scoring by the judges that left viewers baffled, some viewers have claimed that the phone lines were down and they struggled to ring in and save the pair.\n\nHowever, Metro.co.uk has been told by sources that at no point were the phones out of service, despite the high call volumes.\n\nThe online voting system, which is free, has not been reported to have any issues.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Strictly Come Dancing for comment.\n\nDev and Dianne went up against Aljaz and Emma (Picture: BBC)\n\nViewers have even threatened to boycott the shot as Dev and Dianne said goodbye to their time on the series too soon.\n\nRadio DJ Dev couldn\u2019t hide his frustration at the controversial decision and told Tess Daly: \u2018I\u2019m not going to lie I am absolutely gutted.\n\nHe then added: \u2018But learning how to dance, hanging out with Dianne and the other pros and celebs\u2026 I\u2019ve absolutely loved it.\u2019\n\nDianne, who made last year\u2019s finals with Joe Sugg, said: \u2018Dev has been absolutely amazing. His work ethic is insane. I see him everywhere practising and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better partner.\n\n\u2018Thank you so much for all your time and your effort. This boy has so much talent, I\u2019m really sad he won\u2019t be able to show you guys any more of it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues next Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
