The 25-year-old rookie\u2019s perspective is different than most players who visit SunTrust Park.\n\nHelsley is a member of the Cherokee nation. The Tahlequah, Oklahoma, native speaks the Cherokee language and is one of only a few Native Americans in the majors.\n\nHearing the chant by the fans, a part of the Braves\u2019 tradition since it was borrowed from Florida State in the early 1990s, was a shock for Helsley.\n\nHelsley told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he was insulted by what he saw and heard in Thursday\u2019s series opener.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d Helsley said before the Braves\u2019 3-0 win in Friday\u2019s Game 2 .\n\n\u201cJust depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual. They are a lot more than that. It\u2019s not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots. The Redskins and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nHelsley can trace his lineage to ancestors who were forced to march along the Trail of Tears.\n\nHelsley\u2019s grandfather was full-blooded Cherokee. His great aunt teaches at an immersion school where the Cherokee language is taught to assure its continued use.\n\nThe right-hander recorded one out and gave up one hit in the Cardinals\u2019 7-6 win in Game 1 . He did not appear in Game 2 and was not available for comment following the game.\n\nHelsley, who spent much of the season shuffling between St. Louis and Triple-A Memphis, was not with the Cardinals when they made their only regular-season visit to Atlanta on May 14-16.\n\nThe Braves made sure fans were ready for the chant. Red foam tomahawks were waiting at every seat in the park before Thursday\u2019s game.\n\nHelsley told the paper \u201cthe disappointing part\u201d is that \u201cstuff like this still goes on. It\u2019s just disrespectful, I think.\u201d\n\nBraves fans often start the chant when visiting teams make a pitching change, including when Helsley entered in the eighth inning.\n\nAfter the game Thursday, Helsley researched the chant\u2019s history, including attempts to change or erase it from Braves games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that people have suggested that they should change it, and it\u2019s still the same thing,\u201d he said.\n\nMLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Washington Post in February \u201cThe Braves have taken steps to take out the tomahawk chop.\u201d\n\nStill, in-house music encourages the chant, not to mention the free foam tomahawks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Helsley said.\n\n\u201cI feel like there are a lot of other things they could use as mascots. Using our heritage as a mascot, it isn\u2019t the best thing. There have been schools who in the past 20, 30 years have changed their mascots. I don\u2019t see why professional teams are so far behind on that.\u201d\n\nThe chant also has been used by fans of the NFL\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "St. Louis Cardinals reliever Ryan Helsley thinks the Tomahawk Chop chant is insulting, and he was disappointed when it was heard during Game 1 of the NL Division Series against Atlanta.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/nlds_cardinals_helsleys_insult_baseball_82119_c0-267-4410-2838_s1770x1032.jpg?4227eadf574456c4d14b722b6dd0a9837c11f27d", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
