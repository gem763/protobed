On Thursday night, he had a goal and three assists in New York\u2019s 6-4 home victory over Winnipeg.\n\nArtemi Panarin also scored for the Rangers, and Alexandar Georgiev stopped 31 shots.\n\nBrady Tkachuk scored for the Senators, and Craig Anderson made 26 saves.\n\nZibanejad opened the scoring on a power-play at 6:04 of the first period, and Tkachuk tied it midway through the period.\n\nZibanejad broke the tie at 9:53 of the second and made it 3-1 with a short-handed goal at 12:07. Zibanejad then set up Panarin\u2019s power-play goal early in the third.\n\nNOTES: The Senators announced they will retire Chris Phillips\u2019 No. 4 on Feb. 18. Phillips is the Senators\u2018 leader in games played at 1,179. He officially retired in 2016.
