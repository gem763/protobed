We do, so we started asking. Welcome to Why Is Your Skin So Good. Photo: Courtesy of Scottie Beam\n\nWant more skin care? Join our Facebook Group, the Beauty of It All.\n\nLike many of the Cut\u2019s \u201cWhy Is Your Skin So Good\u201d subjects, Scottie Beam says she had \u201chorrible\u201d acne as a teenager. Beam, one fifth of Black Girl Podcast, took skin-care cues from her family. \u201cI started watching my mother and grandmother\u2019s routines and copied them until I had money to afford the kinds of products I wanted to experiment with,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe experience gave her \u201ca positive outlook on beauty,\u201d Beam says. \u201cWhen I was younger, I spent a lot of time altering myself to be someone else\u2019s idea of what is beautiful. Beauty then was draining; beauty now is exciting. But I struggle with patience with skin care. I love when products have an instant outcome.\u201d\n\nRead on for her current rotation of products, including a face oil that \u201cworks magic,\u201d plenty of Dermalogica, and a superthick moisturizer with SPF.\n\nDermalogica Daily Microfoliant \u201cThis exfoliator leaves my skin with a tingle, making me feel like it\u2019s still working even after I\u2019ve rinsed it off. Exfoliating gives you that undeniable glow that you can\u2019t get from makeup. Give those fresh cells a chance to show! The name says \u2018daily,\u2019 but it\u2019s so thorough that I feel like I only need it twice a week, or three times if it\u2019s been a busy one with lots of shoots and me jumping in and out of a makeup chair.\u201d $59 at Dermstore Buy\n\nDermalogica Special Cleansing Gel \u201cI love how gentle this wash is on my face. Jackie Aina, a beauty YouTuber, put me on to this cleanser. I couldn\u2019t get over how flawless her skin was, so I figured it was worth a try, and after one use, I was hooked. I use it both morning and night. Despite how gentle it is, it\u2019s really thorough. I don\u2019t know that my skin has ever felt so clean. I apply a layer to my skin, then work a small amount into a lather, massage, and rinse.\u201d $39 at Dermstore Buy\n\nCaudal\u00ede Vinoperfect Anti-Dark-Spot Serum \u201cThis serum helps with hyperpigmentation. This is the only one that truly evens out my overall skin tone. It works wonders, but I still experience the occasional dark spot, so I\u2019m still searching for the perfect remedy. For now, this is close to ideal. It works without some of the problems that I\u2019ve experienced with other products (like the results not lasting).\u201d $79 at Dermstore Buy\n\nKiehl\u2019s Since 1851 Ultra Facial Cream SPF 30 \u201cI love how thick this cream is. I mix it with rose-hip oil that I order right off Amazon \u2014 Kate Blanc\u2019s works and is inexpensive. I put three to four drops in with my moisturizer to give me a good summer glow and to help combat acne. I wear SPF to keep me from wrinkling. I know it has other great benefits, but let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s all about preserving the elasticity of the skin. It goes on without leaving a pasty cast on my skin, absorbs quickly, and leaves me feeling covered without its feeling heavy. I picked this up from a makeup artist (I\u2019m sorry for forgetting who!) who looked 25 years younger than she was and counted this as part of her routine.\u201d $30 at Sephora Buy\n\nFarmacy Honey Grail Ultra-Hydrating Face Oil \u201cThis honey oil adds to my summer glow, though I feel like I should be adding it to my tea. It smells AMAZING and works magic. Some people mix this with their foundation for more complete and flawless coverage. I love wearing this with my tinted moisturizer for that very reason. A little goes a long way. Two drops, and it blends easily, goes on smooth, and lasts all day.\u201d $48 at Sephora Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nStay in touch.
