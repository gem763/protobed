REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government hopes to bring order to India\u2019s often chaotic roads with a tenfold increase in fines for more serious offences to between 5,000 rupees ($70) and 100,000 rupees ($1,400) - far in excess of the per capita monthly income of 10,500 rupees ($147).\n\nLast week, media reported a rickshaw driver was hit with fines that were nearly twice the cost of his vehicle.\n\nOn Thursday, representatives of three Indian state governments told Reuters they were reconsidering whether to implement the hike.\n\nLocal media reported that more than a dozen of India\u2019s 29 states - including some ruled by or in alliance with the BJP - were opposed in some way to the increases, while members of the opposition Congress party have protested outside the home of India\u2019s federal roads minister, Nitin Gadkari.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that there is public anger about the extent of the fines. We have written to Mr Gadkari about our concerns and urged him to reconsider,\u201d Diwakar Raote, transport minister for the western state of Maharashtra, told Reuters.\n\nThe state government led by the Shiv Sena party, a key ally of the BJP, was currently neither opposed nor in favour of the act that introduced the steeper fines, he added.\n\n\u201cPeople consider the fines under the act as too high,\u201d Padmanabha Behera, commerce and transport minister in the eastern state of Odisha, told Reuters. \u201cWe are examining the steps other states are taking and will take a decision soon.\u201d\n\nRakesh Tripathi, spokesman for the BJP government in India\u2019s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, told Reuters it was reviewing how it would implement the act.\n\n\u201cThe cabinet will decide on it in the next meeting,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for India\u2019s federal transport ministry declined to comment.\n\nGadkari told reporters on Wednesday the increases were required to combat the appalling safety record of India\u2019s roads, where 100,000 people are killed and nearly 500,000 injured in accidents every year.", "description": "More than a dozen Indian states are planning to resist or reconsider steep hikes in traffic fines imposed by the central government, ministers and local media said on Thursday, amid rising anger from motorists across the country.", "authors": ["Shilpa Jamkhandikar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429056304&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0YK", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
