Many people taking part in the protests wear face masks to hide their identities and shield themselves from tear gas, meaning the ban on masks could have a deterring effect on demonstrations.\n\nIt came as the city loosened guidelines on the use of force by police as it struggles to stamp out anti-government protests that have rocked the Asian financial hub for nearly four months, according to documents seen by Reuters.\n\nThe loosening of restrictions on the use of force came into effect shortly before some of the most violent turmoil seen in the protests on Tuesday, with police firing about 1,400 rounds of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets and six live rounds, as protesters threw petrol bombs and wielded sticks.\n\nThe charges against the 18-year-old protester are likely to inflame tensions further in a city already reeling that an officer from the once publicly feted Hong Kong police force fired a live shot at close range.\n\nTaxis drive down a road occupied by protesters in the Causeway Bay district on Wednesday night Credit: Chan Long Hei/Bloomberg More\n\nThe protester was armed only with a makeshift shield made from what appeared to be a boogie board, and a white pole.
