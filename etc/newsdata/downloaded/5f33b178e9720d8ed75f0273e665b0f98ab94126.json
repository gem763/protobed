However Erik ten Hag\u2019s side have bounced back after selling Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt in the summer and sit top of Group H before hosting Chelsea on Wednesday evening.\n\nLampard has given youth a chance since taking over at Stamford Bridge, with Tammy Abraham, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Reece James, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori all catching the eye, but he feels Chelsea\u2019s academy is not yet at the same level as Ajax\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go to claim the similarities,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t get carried away with ourselves. It\u2019s great we have a good feeling at the club, in terms of the young players that have come through. I think it\u2019s long-deserved recognition for the academy itself and those players. But we are at a place that is steeped in history of creating great teams with groups of young players over the years. We have a long way to go to do that. But in the short term I\u2019m certainly happy.\u201d\n\nThis promises to be a tough test for Chelsea, who are second in the group after earning three points from their first two games. Ross Barkley, Andreas Christensen, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Antonio R\u00fcdiger are out against the group leaders, who opened their European campaign with thumping wins over Valencia and Lille. But Lampard wants his young side to push themselves.\n\n\u201cI aim to give them confidence because I believe in them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Ajax did last year was incredible. With us, I think you see my belief in them because even though everyone says we had a transfer ban and it\u2019s the only option I have, that\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cThe young players have shown it. But we mustn\u2019t get carried away with thinking that\u2019s the end of the story. It\u2019s a nice story until now but success in the longer term is what we have to work for. I keep saying it is just the beginning of the road but I feel like by having belief in them, they can feel that back. I also need to be strong in driving them to get better all the time.\u201d\n\nLike Ajax, Chelsea have installed former players in important positions in recent years. Petr Cech was appointed as the club\u2019s technical and performance adviser in the summer, Ashley Cole is coaching the under-15s and Carlo Cudicini, Tore Andr\u00e9 Flo, Claude Makelele and Paulo Ferreira hold influential roles. \u201cWith ex-players, you would hope there is a feeling for the club, a feeling from the fans who like to see players who care about their careers at the club,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cYou can try and continue with an idea or an ethos, which is where teams like Ajax and Bayern Munich get it so right because it doesn\u2019t change on short-term results. It tends to stay for the longer term.\n\n\u201cAlso with ex-players, it is a great thing for the club but they should be there on merit. I should be manager of this club on merit because I want to work hard, be successful and help improve the club. So should everybody. Petr Cech has a work ethic to be the best he can be every day.\u201d\n\nFrank Lampard criticises France over handling of injured N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 Read more\n\nTomori revealed that Gareth Southgate and the Football Association have offered England\u2019s players counselling following last week\u2019s racist abuse in Bulgaria. \u201cObviously it was a difficult experience,\u201d the centre-back said. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was just play our football, to win the game. That\u2019s what we did. When stuff like that happens you have to try and block it out even though it is so blatant.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to go out there, play our game and win. The manager spoke to us after and said there was help there if needed. It\u2019s just one of those things that happened. The whole set up of the FA and the manager and the people around us made it clear that if we need to [seek help] we can. We have good staff and teammates around us to talk to if we need to.\u201d\n\nTomori added that English football must also tackle its racism problem after the alleged abuse at Haringey Borough\u2019s FA Cup tie against Yeovil Town last Saturday. \u201cRacism, wherever it is, is not a laughing matter and is something that needs to be kicked out of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gradual process. It\u2019s not going to stop overnight and we just have to keep on drumming it into people that it\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d", "description": "The Chelsea manager has said he is not getting carried away with his young side\u2019s performances this season", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcff8ee96e2a6e3c18ce3e50529bd80c91438471/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7369574806f0ba312071c8ec0ed8f6b7", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
