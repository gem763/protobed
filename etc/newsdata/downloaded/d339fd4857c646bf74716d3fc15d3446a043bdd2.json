He\u2019s going to boycott the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry on grounds of procedural unfairness \u2014 namely, there hasn\u2019t been a formal House vote to open the inquiry, which would have given Republican members more power over the proceedings, and there\u2019s been way too much secrecy already in how Schiff is questioning witnesses. For cripes sake, he\u2019s reportedly considering how to interview the whistleblower while obscuring his/her identity so that Republicans on the Intel Committee won\u2019t find out who it is and leak the information. The White House believes, or at least wants the public to believe, that the only winning move in this wargame is not to play. The system is rigged! They won\u2019t help Schiff run his \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s noteworthy that Byron York\u2019s Republican sources in the House are nonetheless \u201cbaffled\u201d by Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nRepublicans were looking forward to Sondland testimony. Also had the high ground with demands for transparency. Thought he was going to testify until an hour ago.https://t.co/GZ8feBCtAC \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 8, 2019\n\nAlso, WH was going to write letter laying out case for non-cooperation with Pelosi's no-vote-I-say-so impeachment inquiry. Haven't done so. Might or might not work with courts, anyway. In any event, Republicans baffled.https://t.co/GZ8feBCtAC \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 8, 2019\n\nThe problem right now with Trump\u2019s approach of signaling scorn for the Democrats\u2019 sham process is that the public doesn\u2019t agree that it\u2019s a sham and even seems to be growing more convinced of its necessity if you believe WaPo\u2019s data this morning. Every poll I\u2019ve seen over the last two weeks has found at least plurality support for House Dems opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conduct towards Ukraine. Trump is hoping, I guess, that a new round of \u201cwitch hunt\u201d attacks on the process will bring some wayward Republican voters back over onto his side. (The most alarming number in the WaPo poll was support for the inquiry rising to 29 percent even among *Republicans.*) But blocking Sondland could have the opposite effect by convincing fencesitters that Trump really does have something to hide and has now resorted to outright obstruction of the investigation in a desperate attempt to protect himself. Schiff even utters the O-word at the end of the clip below.\n\nSondland is no minor witness, remember. Potentially he\u2019s the key to the whole mystery of whether Trump really did intend a quid pro quo with Ukraine involving military aid and the Bidens. Read this post for background. Sondland reportedly told Ron Johnson flat out in August that a quid pro quo was in the works, and Johnson would be a difficult witness for Republicans to discredit for obvious partisan reasons. Sondland also reportedly worked on a Trump-pleasing draft statement for Ukraine that would have committed the government to investigating \u201ccorruption,\u201d including the Biden/Burisma matter, although the statement was never actually issued. And Sondland was the guy responsible for that strange text exchange with Bill Taylor in September in which Taylor complained about what looked to him to be a quid pro quo. Sondland went quiet for several hours after that text and reportedly spoke to Trump directly in the interim before texting back to Taylor that of course our president would never attempt to trade military aid for something of value to him like a Biden probe.\n\nThere are a lot of questions for him. The impeachment case may rest on him. If Trump won\u2019t let him testify, how can Democrats not proceed with obstruction?\n\nMaybe Trump\u2019s strategy, as Ed speculated, is simply to drag this out. Yes, House Democrats would probably win a court fight to compel Sondland\u2019s testimony but they want to wrap up impeachment ASAP, not sit around paralyzed for months while the courts mull it over. The longer it takes, the closer we get to the election, the easier it is for Republicans in Congress to say that it\u2019s too late to impeach and we should just let voters decide the matter in November. Realizing that, Democrats may decide not to even bother with forcing Sondland to testify and proceed instead to impeach Trump for obstruction. What happens then, I assume, is that Senate Republicans acquit on grounds that Trump has some sort of insuperable executive privilege that lets him withhold evidence from Congress whenever he likes. They\u2019re gonna acquit him no matter what; it\u2019s a matter of finding the reason. The question is how the public reacts to all of that. With more Americans already in favor of conducting an impeachment inquiry than opposed, which side \u201cwins\u201d the PR war if Trump starts blocking people from testifying, gets impeached, and then is acquitted half-heartedly on grounds that he has a moral right to obstruct unfair investigations?\n\nIf today\u2019s WaPo poll means anything, it means Democrats are increasingly unlikely to suffer a major backlash from impeachment. The higher support for investigating Trump and Ukraine goes, the more eager voters will be potentially to side with the Dem narrative that Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate is obstruction of a legitimate probe, not a righteous refusal to participate in a sham Star Chamber proceeding.\n\nThe question today is whether Pelosi wants to play hardball over Sondland or not. Democrats could impeach him for refusing to testify, I assume, but that would risk making the impeachment process seem more petty than it already is and Sondland certainly wouldn\u2019t be convicted by the Senate anyway. He\u2019s willing to testify, after all. It\u2019s Trump who\u2019s holding him back. What Dems could do instead is subpoena him and then move to hold him in contempt and request an expedited disposition in court if/when Sondland challenges them. If the courts comply and rule in their favor, that\u2019s a big win for them. If the courts decide to take their time with the matter, Pelosi might just drop the court battle and move to impeach Trump for obstruction instead.\n\nHere\u2019s Schiff speaking after Sondland failed to show, followed by Jim Jordan.\n\n.@RepAdamSchiff on White House Blocking Sondland Testimony & Documents \"The failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents, we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress.\" pic.twitter.com/Tguxdk9mDG \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 8, 2019", "description": "Evidence.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/as1-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
