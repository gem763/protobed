Now you have the option of donating to their campaign through e-commerce giant Amazon\u2019s Alexa-enabled devices \u2014 but experts caution your privacy could be at risk.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nUnder a new feature called Alexa Political Contributions, starting on Thursday Amazon will let Americans donate to U.S. presidential campaigns using the phrases \u201cAlexa, I want to make a political contribution,\u201d or \u201cAlexa, donate (x amount) to (y candidate).\u201d\n\nThe minimum donation is $5, and users \u2013 over the age of 18 \u2013 are able to donate a total of $200 per campaign for an election cycle.\n\nHowever, cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright \u2013 the chief security advisor for SentinelOne, told FOX Business Americans may want to steer clear of the new software.\n\n\u201cThis is a treasure trove of data,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThere are significant privacy concerns.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright expressed apprehension over the use of any voice assistant \u2013 and has himself disabled all Alexa devices in his home.\n\nEarlier this year, a report surfaced that Amazon workers listen to and transcribe recordings. In response, the company said it only annotates an \u201cextremely small number of interactions\u201d in order to improve customer experience.\n\nLast year, Amazon\u2019s Alexa Echo reportedly recorded and shared a private conversation.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company announced new privacy protections for its Alexa-enabled devices in May, following complaints that it was violating a children\u2019s privacy act. The measures make it easier to delete recordings.\n\n\u201cToo many people will do it without realizing the implications that come with it,\u201d Wright added. \u201cNot just privacy, but security.\u201d\n\nWright pointed to a scenario whereby a malicious actor compromises Amazon\u2019s database, and is able to make multiple false donations. He also said it could enable actors from China or Russia to disguise the source of a donation after compromising somebody\u2019s account.\n\nNot to mention other consequences if third parties access the data.\n\nElection integrity and consumer privacy is of particular concern in 2020, following an incident whereby millions of Facebook users\u2019 personal information was accessed by a third-party during the 2016 cycle.\n\nThe move also comes at a time of mounting antitrust scrutiny of big tech on Capitol Hill. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will hold meetings with lawmakers this week to discuss the future of internet regulation.\n\nYet, the feature could put Amazon square in the center of the political space.\n\n\u201cThis would be the beginning of Amazon being inserted into the middle of the political process,\u201d Wright said, explaining they would own the experience between the donor and the party he or she donated to.\n\nThe transaction will be processed via Amazon Pay, using the default payment method stored on a users\u2019 Amazon account. An email receipt will be sent to the donor.\n\nOnly candidates that have set up preferences to accept Alexa donations will be allowed to receive them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Starting this week, Americans will be able donate as much as $200 to their favorite candidates.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Amazon-Alexa-Echo-Plus.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
