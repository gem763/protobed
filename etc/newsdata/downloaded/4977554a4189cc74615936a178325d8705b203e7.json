It could leave with a deal or without one - or not leave at all.\n\nWhen asked if there was enough time to deliver a Brexit deal, Barclay said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want an extension and we do believe there is enough time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are focused on getting a deal because we think this is the best way forward,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cThese are serious proposals and clearly we need to have a negotiation with the EU on taking them forward.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Stephen Barclay is seen outside the venue for the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, October 1, 2019.

A law passed by his opponents forces him to delay Brexit unless he strikes a deal. Johnson said further delay was \u201cpointless and expensive\u201d.\n\nAmid so much pessimism about the possibility of a deal in just weeks, many diplomats say a phoney struggle is underway between London and Brussels to apportion blame.", "description": "Britain is willing to negotiate the details of its last ditch Brexit offer to the European Union but it is now up to the bloc to be creative and flexible to avoid a disorderly departure on Oct. 31, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436552344&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920GM"}
