But at the Smart Financial Center outside Houston in late July, thousands of fans gathered with homemade banners, tribute costumes, and armfuls of merchandise as they waited in line to see Monsta X, a K-pop group on their third world tour. These fans didn\u2019t get here because of radio play or by combing through bins at a music store. Instead, everyone I ask says they\u2019ve shown up thanks to one specific site: YouTube.\n\nOnline, K-pop\u2019s addictive tunes and big-budget videos are raking in billions of streams, making new fans across the globe, and continually breaking YouTube records. Stateside, acts like BTS and Blackpink are becoming red carpet regulars and selling out stadiums, as Monsta X has for the show I\u2019m at in Texas. So how did this genre go beyond South Korea\u2019s borders to the world\u2019s biggest stages? The rapid growth of YouTube is a crucial component, but it\u2019s also the way K-pop is so perfectly packaged to spread on YouTube itself.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the Olympian athletes of the pop world,\u201d says Steve Aoki, who recently collaborated with Monsta X on the single \u201cPlay It Cool.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re trained athletes at what they do. Whether it\u2019s in media training, to their dancing, to their singing. Koreans have mastered that, so everyone else has to catch up, or at least take note and learn.\u201d\n\nThe first modern K-pop group, Seo Taiji and Boys, debuted in 1992. But most Americans wouldn\u2019t be familiar with the genre until two decades later when Psy\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d became the first video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe history of K-pop outside of Korea is really closely tied to the spread of the technology that people use to discover it and to listen to it,\u201d says Kevin Allocca, head of culture and trends at YouTube.\n\n\u201cK-pop is more than just music.\u201d\n\nYouTube started seeing rapid jumps in views of K-pop videos as early as 2011 when views jumped three-fold in a single year to 2.3 billion. Those views were mostly coming from international fans, and that\u2019s still the case today. \u201cIf you look at the top 25 most-watched K-pop groups over the past year, 90 percent of the views are coming from outside of South Korea,\u201d Allocca says.\n\nK-pop had its audio-visual formula in place long before YouTube was a popular destination for discovering music, giving the genre an early advantage as YouTube matured. In the \u201990s, Lee Soo-man, founder of South Korean company SM Entertainment, developed a branding strategy called \u201ccultural technology\u201d that was meant to create massive hits and \u201cset global trends, from not only music but also costume, choreography, and music video.\u201d\n\nSM Entertainment literally wrote a manual for its employees on how to popularize K-pop artists outside South Korea using these elements. According to The New Yorker, it details things like \u201cthe precise color of eyeshadow a performer should wear in a particular country; the exact hand gestures he or she should make; and the camera angles to be used in the videos (a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree group shot to open the video, followed by a montage of individual closeups).\u201d\n\nThose techniques have been honed over time, resulting in modern K-pop videos that are designed to hook people in the first few seconds, even if the person watching doesn\u2019t understand the lyrics. They use things like quick cuts, fast zooms, tons of locations, flashy sets, and, of course, impeccable performances.\n\nSuper-sharp choreography has become a hallmark for K-pop, and acts like Monsta X develop new routines for every single music video. This isn\u2019t your normal choreography, either. Seeing a group perform complex moves with razor-like precision is mesmerizing to watch. Because it\u2019s so important, songs are often written with this in mind. \u201cAs I\u2019m working on the drop, I want to imagine these guys dancing to the song,\u201d Aoki says of his collaboration with Monsta X. \u201cBecause 50 percent of the song is the visual part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the Olympian athletes of the pop world.\u201d\n\nMonsta X member I.M says the videos also make each song easier for \u201cthe audience to understand,\u201c which helps them connect with a broader set of viewers. \u201cK-pop is more than just music because we always prepare choreography with the stage song,\u201d I.M says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are preparing music video[s] every single time.\u201d\n\nThe formula is working, and it\u2019s allowed K-pop to spread faster on YouTube than any other style of music. \u201cHalf of the biggest 24-hour debuts on YouTube are all K-pop groups,\u201d Allocca says. Additionally, he says the top K-pop songs also get almost twice as many likes and five times as many comments as the top songs from other genres.\n\nOnce fans are on board, there\u2019s more to draw them in. K-pop acts publish additional content around the music videos for fans to watch, like behind the scenes looks, videos that highlight different members of the group, \u201cdance practice\u201d videos that teach fans the choreography to a song, and videos to learn the chants that you\u2019re supposed to use when you\u2019re at the show. As Simon from Eat Your Kimchi previously told The Verge, \u201cThe record labels will actually release a song to the official fan groups before it hits the actual airwaves. The fan groups can memorize a fan chant of a song, so at the actual debut performance of the song they can sing along with it. It\u2019s a crucial part of the marketing.\u201d\n\nThe fans also create tons of content on their own for YouTube. They make reaction videos, dance cover videos, guides that give new fans crash courses on groups, and provide lyric translations in other languages. It all helps people access and participate in the K-pop fandom, regardless of language or where they are in the world. \u201cBeing a fan at sort of a deeper level with these artists means connecting with them in ways that go beyond just listening to the music,\u201d Allocca says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not passive listeners,\u201d Aoki says of K-pop fans. \u201cThey know every single song. They watch every single video. Each one of those people are a view on every single video that reached 500 million views on YouTube.\u201d\n\nThe official videos that are produced by the biggest K-pop acts can be incredibly reference-dense, creating a rich mythology for fans to unpack. Some symbols are less concrete than others, so it\u2019s up to the fans to figure out what they all mean, and that\u2019s often done online. \u201cOne of the places that these communities can gather is in the comments,\u201d says Allocca, \u201cand they will both be debating things, but they\u2019ll also be sort of pointing out things in the video to each other or giving you a sort of a pathway into something that they\u2019ve noticed to help you appreciate this thing as the work of art that they see it as.\u201d\n\nThere are tons of Easter eggs in the English-language video for Monsta X and Steve Aoki\u2019s \u201cPlay It Cool,\u201d for example, including the words \u201cAirplane Mode\u201d appearing in Korean, a reference to lyrics in the Korean-language version of the same song. But many of Monsta X\u2019s other videos go even further. They\u2019ve had videos tease out stories dealing with time travel, societal reform, and the seven deadly sins, which have led to tons of fan theories being hashed out in YouTube comments.\n\nBefore streaming and social media, music was largely curated by a select few in the record industry \u2014 entities like radio DJs, labels, and critics. Now, it\u2019s curated by the masses, by fans who can pick and choose exactly what they want to see and listen to. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big platform,\u201d says Monsta X\u2019s Minhyuk. \u201cAnd, K-pop isn\u2019t just the music.\u201d I.M nods in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get inside of that channel and watch whatever you want,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see some video what is related with that video, too. So I think it\u2019s really important to us.\u201d \u201cEverything is available,\u201d chimes in bandmate Kihyun. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit.\u201d\n\nPeople discover music differently now, and K-pop makes the most of this on YouTube. Online platforms allow people from all over the world to dictate what is popular and to connect \u2014 not just with the artists but with each other \u2014 in new and often meaningful ways. \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by non-Koreans singing Korean,\u201d Aoki says. \u201cI love that a nondominant language is becoming a force. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m part of this day and age where I can be part of that process and help push that out there to the world. Because the world\u2019s much bigger than just English.\u201d\n\nI.M smiles as he talks about the future. \u201cWe hope the world gets ready for us.\u201d\n\nMake sure to check out other episodes of The Future of Music here.", "description": "In the fourth episode of The Future of Music season 2, Dani Deahl talks to Korean stars Monsta X and American DJ and producer Steve Aoki about the global rise of K-pop.", "authors": ["Dani Deahl", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggII8Nl730YWhTLBVk5BJP9qJ2w=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18963315/akrales_190727_3561_0122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
