(Alberto Pellaschiar/AP/file)\n\nFormer Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi on Friday threatened to sue a onetime campaign aide to President Trump who claimed that Renzi was part of a scheme, allegedly orchestrated by President Barack Obama, to undermine Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016.\n\nIn an interview with a right-wing Italian newspaper, the aide described a series of events \u2014 heavy on conspiracy \u2014 in which the very origins of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the election began because Obama worked to plant a Maltese professor-turned-spy at a university in Rome. The aide, George Papadopoulos, said that \u201csuch an operation\u201d could only have happened with Italian government knowledge, and that Renzi cooperated to carry out the \u201clow blow\u201d against Trump.\n\nThe accusation against Renzi, who was prime minister from 2014 until 2016, is not supported by evidence.\n\nBut it remains relevant, if only because Trump officials and advisers are increasingly pursuing aspects of Papadopoulos\u2019s broader theory: namely, that the Maltese professor was in fact a Western intelligence plant. It was disclosed earlier this week that Attorney General William P. Barr had paid several personal visits to Italy, including one in late September, where he pushed Italians for information on U.S. election interference and its aftermath.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say Barr is particularly interested in the role of the professor, Joseph Mifsud, a murky figure whose allegiances have long been debated by the far right, and who has not surfaced publicly in two years.\n\nDemocrats say Trump and his lieutenants are trying to discredit the evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nA former Italian government official familiar with the matter said the Italian position is that Mifsud is \u201cnot such a relevant person\u201d and that Rome did nothing to interfere with U.S. politics.\n\nWriting on his authorized Facebook page, Renzi, who recently launched a new political party, said fake news was crossing \u201cnational borders\u201d and that the \u201cextent of hoaxes should never be underestimated.\u201d He said he would sue Papadopoulos for slander.\n\nCaroline Polisi, a lawyer for Papadopoulos, declined to comment on Renzi\u2019s legal threat.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI and was sentenced last year to 14 days in prison. His guilty plea stemmed from lies he told about Mifsud that hindered agents\u2019 ability to effectively question or detain the professor.\n\nIt was Mifsud who had allegedly alerted Papadopoulos that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the form of thousands of emails. That conversation eventually made its way to U.S. government officials, after Papadopoulos remarked about what he had learned to an Australian diplomat at a London bar. That Australian relayed the information to the United States after Democratic emails began to leak online. That chain of events is what set into motion the probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nThe Mueller report notes that Mifsud \u201chad connections to Russia\u201d and \u201cmaintained various Russian contacts,\u201d including a former employee of the Internet Research Agency, the Russian organization that carried out a social media disinformation campaign in 2016. But Mifsud has told the Italian media he does not work for Russia.\n\nIn April, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said on Fox News that Mifsud was a \u201ca counterintelligence operative, either Maltese or Italian,\u201d who took part in what sounded to him like a \u201ccounterintelligence trap\u201d against Papadopoulos.\n\nEllen Nakashima and Rosalind Helderman contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Former campaign aide George Papadopoulos alleged in an interview that the Italian was part of a scheme orchestrated by Barack Obama to undermine Trump\u2019s run for president.", "authors": ["Chico Harlan", "Rome Bureau Chief Covering Southern Europe", "Sometimes Parts Beyond", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D_zTBGqR-ICFHbMg3jO34X1fLbw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SQJK3PHHAMI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
