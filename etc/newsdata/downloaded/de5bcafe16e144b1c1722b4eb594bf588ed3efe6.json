Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO 2020 elections Andrew Yang: No apologies for the Asian jokes\n\nAndrew Yang says he isn\u2019t going to stop making Asian jokes. In fact, the entrepreneur-presidential candidate added another one in an interview Wednesday with POLITICO.\n\nAsked whether the Democratic National Committee\u2019s debate-qualifying thresholds had altered his campaign\u2019s strategic approach, Yang initially stopped himself. \u201cI was about to tell an Asian joke,\u201d he conceded to some laughter, including his own, before leaning in.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Asian, so I love tests,\u201d he continued, adding that the DNC\u2019s rules have been \u201cincredibly helpful\u201d to him because he knows how many donors \u2014 and what polling numbers \u2014 he needs to aim for.\n\nYang, a political novice who is centering his campaign on the government\u2019s providing all adults with $1,000 a month, has flouted conventional wisdom and seemingly every expectation about his outsider run, which has seen him overtake more than a dozen established politicians in polls.\n\nBut during his unlikely rise, Yang has taken heat for playing up Asian stereotypes \u2014 from all the physicians he\u2019s personally familiar with (\u201cNow, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors,\u201d he said at the last debate), to his affinity for mathematics (\u201cThe opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math,\u201d he likes to say in closing his speeches).\n\nSome supporters have said they see the jokes as self-deprecating and appropriate \u201cin-group\u201d humor because Yang is Asian American. Yet, the quips aren\u2019t landing with critics who say they help perpetuate labels they\u2019ve spent years working to eliminate.\n\nYang said on Wednesday he isn\u2019t surprised by the disagreement. And he stressed he isn\u2019t going to hold back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very diverse community, and if Asian Americans disagree with my response to a particular issue, or a joke I tell, that\u2019s something I would expect and accept,\u201d he told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to dramatically change anything I\u2019ve been doing to date,\u201d Yang added. \u201cAnd I think that the vast majority of the Asian Americans I encounter seem very excited about my campaign.\u201d", "description": "During his unlikely rise, Yang has taken heat for playing up Asian stereotypes", "authors": ["Christopher Cadelago"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/8e/9cce90894836af921b6caf011903/190918-yang-mahaskey-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
