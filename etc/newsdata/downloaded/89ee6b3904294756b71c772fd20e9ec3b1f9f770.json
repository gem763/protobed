Of that total, slightly over $1 million will now be directed to the four early voting states, where Biden is locked in a competitive battle for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d says the ad, titled \u201cBiden corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters should know about the self-dealing, influence-peddling Bidens as the campaign season progresses,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump 2020 spokesman.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Biden, to counter Trump's Ukraine attacks, is planning his own $6 million ad campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThe Trump campaign has already begun airing the Biden-focused spot nationally. On Thursday, the Biden campaign sent a letter to Fox News demanding it not run the commercial. The campaign claims it \"spreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the Trump campaign is prepared to fabricate outright lies, your station\u2019s airwaves should not be used to disseminate them,\u201d Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz wrote in the letter. \u201cWe are putting you on notice about the absolute falsity of the advertisement\u2019s claims, and we expect that you will reject it.\"\n\nCNN said Thursday it wouldn\u2019t air the ad, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nThe Trump campaign is capitalizing on its massive bank account to go after Biden more than a year before the general election. The president's campaign and the Republican National Committee announced this week they had raised a combined $125 million during the third quarter of the year.\n\nBiden has emerged as the top Democratic target of the Trump campaign. Many of the president\u2019s top allies think he would be Trump\u2019s most formidable general election opponent. Polling has consistently shown Biden ahead of Trump in critical Rust Belt states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, each of which the president won in 2016.\n\nBy going after Biden, the Trump team hopes to pave the way for another Democrat to win the nomination. Those close to the president would prefer to run against a more liberal candidate, such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.\n\nBiden has aggressively pushed back against the president. During an appearance in Nevada on Thursday, the former vice president accused Trump of \"repeatedly smearing me and my family.\"\n\nThe president, Biden said, \"imagines that this tactic will allow him to pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/60/5c/2059e8664f709d8e3cad9dcff401/191003-donaldtrump-gty-773.jpg"}
