He didn\u2019t have a job, or a home other than the boat.\n\nSweat rituals are the oldest rituals we have. Millennials want something real. There\u2019s so much fake in the world Lasse Eriksen\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more of a bohemian. He was living on his boat, and living off fish,\u201d says a friend, Hans J\u00f8rgen Hamre. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t had a shower for months. He didn\u2019t doubt there would be a sauna [in the marina]. He was looking forward to that. But there wasn\u2019t one \u2013 or even hot water.\u201d\n\nLundberg was hugely disappointed. Most ports in Sweden have saunas, where it is part of the popular culture; in neighbouring Finland saunas are practically a way of life. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t have that in Norway.\u201d\n\nHamre, a proud Osloite, suggested what he assumed would be a logical conclusion: that they build a floating sauna themselves. He found a group of people who were visiting Norway for temporary seasonal work, established a camp on a beach in nearby Hoved\u00f8ya island, and set about the construction as a kind of gift to the city. After all, he reasoned, Oslo was in the process of transforming its waterfront.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin Lundberg, centre, waving, built the first public sauna in Oslo.

Forty years ago the area was full of warehouses and shipyards, and the water was heavily polluted. Then, in 1982, \u201cour shipbuilding industry was shut down due to competition from Japan and Korea\u201d, said Stein Kolst\u00f8 of the city\u2019s Waterfront Planning Office during the recent Urban Future global conference in Oslo.\n\nThe city faced a dilemma: keep a working port with several port terminals, or open the harbour and fjord to the public. In January 2000, Oslo city council chose the latter. Its \u201cfjord city\u201d plan has seen former port areas redeveloped, creating around 52 hectares of parks and public spaces, 9,000 apartments and 50,000 workplaces. A major highway that had acted as a physical barrier between the city and the fjord was closed, and rebuilt underground. Polluted soil was dredged from the fjord, and the cargo terminal was moved round the coastline.\n\nHamre assumed his DIY sauna would be welcome in this new, friendlier Oslo harbour. \u201cOn the outside of the sauna we used driftwood so it looked like it came out of the ocean,\u201d he says, adding that the team sourced high-quality sauna wood from a local carpenter in exchange for doing some work for him. The idea was to make the sauna look like it had been washed up from the sea, but to create a clean, cosy, modern interior.\n\nThe result was a striking and charmingly odd sight: a low ramshackle shed made from a patchwork of mismatched wooden planks, with a large black chimney and a palm plant on one side, it fit just 12 people. Unlike many modern Scandinavian saunas, which are sleek, contemporary and tasteful, designed by architects rather than anarchists, the small vessel was made with \u201cmore of an artistic approach\u201d, says Hamre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Oslo\u2019s \u2018fjord city\u2019 plan has created more leisure, work and living space in former port areas around the harbour.

They moved the sauna 14 times over the course of the year to different parts of the waterfront where it wouldn\u2019t be seized. \u201cWe put it places that we knew the authorities didn\u2019t have an eye on,\u201d he says. Then they anchored it along a border between the jurisdiction of the municipality and the port authority, so that each thought it was the other\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cI was surprised we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d says Hamre. \u201cBut the bureaucrats weren\u2019t ready for initiatives like this sauna. It wasn\u2019t in the regulations to receive floating saunas. It\u2019s an industrial harbour and they\u2019re supposed to handle industrial ships and they don\u2019t like all this recreational bullshit.\u201d\n\nOne day, however, the sauna\u2019s fortunes changed: former footballer Freddy dos Santos Instagrammed a selfie next to it.\n\nSuddenly it was hot property. The team met an urban developer working for the municipality who became an advocate, and a cold water swimming group of workers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested they could help file paperwork to legalise the construction.\n\nOne of those swimmers was Ragna Marie Fjeld, now director of the nonprofit Oslo Fjord Sauna (S\u00f8renga Badstufl\u00e5te): \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the resources to fight the bureaucracy, and do the applications, so we helped them. It\u2019s difficult to get permission to stay in downtown Oslo, but we made it, because we know the bureaucracy. We know how to write applications and who to talk to.\u201d\n\nThe sauna, called M\u00e5ken (\u201cSeagull\u201d), was eventually legalised, and is run as a co-operative by Oslo Fjord Sauna. \u201cWe were the first to have a sauna for public use in modern times in Oslo,\u201d says Hamre, a historian.\n\nOthers began to seize on the idea, and suddenly pop-up saunas \u2013 previously a typically private affair, something enjoyed at home with family or at a spa \u2013 were a public craze. Today Oslo Fjord Sauna now runs two floating saunas in the Bj\u00f8rvika area, and has another two in the pipeline, while another business, KOK, runs three sauna boats. Further round the inlet is Salt, a cluster of tall wooden pyramids with food shacks, a bar, a concert venue and four saunas \u2013 the largest a huge glass-fronted amphitheatre where guests can listen to DJs and bands while they sweat.\n\n\u201cIn the next few years there will be 10-15 saunas by the harbour for the public,\u201d predicts Lasse Eriksen, Norwegian member of the International Sauna Association.\n\nThe new breed of public pop-up saunas is urban, social and popular with a younger crowd \u2013 M\u00e5ken attracts a morning crowd of professionals in their 30s and 40s who head to work after an invigorating dip in the fjord. They have formed a key part of the reinvention of Oslo\u2019s waterfront: the new Munch Museum, a 13-floor building covered in perforated aluminium, is due to open next year, as is the new public library, and a 9km harbour promenade and outdoor swimming area at nearby S\u00f8renga is helping make this area busy with tourists and locals alike.\n\nEriksen believes the ritualistic and ancient nature of sauna has been adopted as a tonic by the city\u2019s younger people because of the pressures of modern life. \u201cSweat rituals are the oldest rituals we have,\u201d he says. \u201cThe millennials want something real. They have all these worries. I believe for them it\u2019s about authenticity and finding something true and real. There\u2019s so much fake in the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People enjoy the M\u00e5ken floating sauna in Oslo harbour. Photograph: Geir Anders Rybakken \u00d8rslien\n\nKOK, meanwhile, is exporting the floating sauna idea with a franchise model. \u201cOur motto is, a bit jokingly, \u2018Make the ports clean again,\u2019 as we believe modern societies acceptance of sub-par water quality in our cities ports should come to an end,\u201d says the firm\u2019s founder, Kristin Lorange.\n\nOslo's car ban sounded simple enough. Then the backlash began Read more\n\nThere remains an uneasiness around the recreational use of Oslo\u2019s water: huge ferries and cruise ships dock on one side, at Vippetangen, and while the port of Oslo encourages swimming, paddling and sailing, safety is a major concern when people stray too close to docking areas. \u201cIt might be dangerous to be close to the ship fairway and docking areas,\u201d says a spokesperson. \u201cIf you\u2019re a big ferry you don\u2019t expect people in your dock. We try to encourage people not to do that.\u201d\n\nThe licences for the floating saunas are also temporary: Oslo Fjord Sauna, for example, has permission for its saunas to stay for one more year, though \u201cwe hope we\u2019ll be able to stay here permanently\u201d, says Fjeld.\n\nHamre is amused by how things have worked out. \u201cWhat can I say? It\u2019s the last laugh and all that. I go there all the time \u2013 I get a discount!\u201d\n\nAs for Lundberg, who\u2019s only contactable on his boat his via VHF radio, he\u2019s now in the town of Moss, south of Oslo, building another sauna.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "When the city\u2019s first floating sauna was banned by port authorities, its owners took it on the run, sparking a public craze", "authors": ["Claire Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/448a1fbcde7df090c6a9adfcbe56781e75a24816/0_118_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a37633a25049f0b20ccbd4eee5ac7688", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
