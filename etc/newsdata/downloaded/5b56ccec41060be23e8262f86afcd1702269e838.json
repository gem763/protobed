Between wired 'buds that won't stay in sweaty earholes to wireless ones that short circuit after a few months due to \"sweat damage,\" it's challenging to find a pair that will last, so you can blast a playlist and hit the pavement with ease over and over again.\n\nIt wasn't until I tried AfterShokz wireless headphones that my running experience was changed forever. Rather than resting in your ears, these nifty headphones sit in front of them and use bone conduction technology to deliver sound via your cheekbones. It's pretty wild but it totally works, and right now, you can get a pair of AfterShokz Airs for their lowest price on Amazon.\n\nThe Airs have typically been selling for around $140, but right now they're available for just under $120. They may still be on the pricey side, but it's well worth it to not have your headphones slip out of your sweaty ears in the middle of your workout.\n\nWhile I haven't tired the Airs myself, they're a lighter version of the Trekz model I typically run with, and I'm confident they'll feel less clunky (though the Trekz are pretty comfortable too). They also have a six-hour battery life and seamless Bluetooth connection. Plus, the open-air design makes it easy to hear your surroundings (even at full volume!) so you will feel safer on runs. The Airs even come with reflective strips to help you be more more visible while running in the dark.\n\nAfter testing two different pairs of AfterShokz bone conduction headphones, I can confidently say they're the best running headphones I've ever used. They may not have the best bass compared to noise-canceling headphones, but they actually stay on your ears so you can listen to your power songs and hit your stride.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
