Photo: Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to consider when shopping for kids\u2019 sneakers. Your child\u2019s age, for one, as well as comfort \u2014 how shoes fit on their feet \u2014 and ease of wear, both for you and your little one. (It\u2019s no secret that kids can be very fidgety, and while putting on a pair of shoes may seem like a simple task for adults, it can feel like an entire process when your tot insists on doing it herself.) To find out what parents should look for, we enlisted the help of three kids\u2019-shoe experts who shared their picks for new walkers, elementary schoolers, and budding athletes. We also consulted a panel of stylish parents who gave us the lowdown on the cutest and coolest styles, which we\u2019ve organized by age group, based on general criteria the experts said you should consider when shopping for your kiddo. Some styles are available in multiple age categories, so we\u2019ve noted that where applicable.\n\nBest sneakers for kids 4 years old and younger\n\nStride Rite SM Jamie (Infant/Toddler) For beginning walkers, Jennifer May, a children\u2019s footwear consultant with more than 25 years in the business and founder of Kidshoeology, likes the Jamie sneaker from Stride Rite. She says the rounded edges provide increased stability and reduce stumbles and falls. The simple style that encourages natural movement and is available in three different widths also lines up with the criteria outlined by Shevaun Mackie Doyle, a pediatric orthopedist at the Hospital for Special Surgery, for choosing kids\u2019 shoes. \u201cThe best shoes for a growing child stimulate being barefoot,\u201d says Doyle. She advises parents look for a \u201cshoe that fits well, that\u2019s breathable, has flexibility, and just enough support and protection from the elements.\u201d $44 at Zappos Buy\n\nOld Soles Pave Cheer (Infant/Toddler) At Brooklyn kids\u2019 shoe store Runnin\u2019 Wild, Old Soles high-top sneakers are popular for little ones, according to store owner Stacey Fauci. \u201cThey have soft leather and nice styles,\u201d she says. The Velcro closure and rubber sole make them easy to put on and move around in. Mika Oakes, the founder of maternity swim brand Moloco, also loves Old Soles shoes for new walkers, too, and recommends this shiny, silvery pair. $50 at Zappos Buy\n\nSee Kai Run Kids Robyne (Toddler/Little Kid) $36 (was $45, now 20% off) Fauci says canvas shoes from the Seattle-based brand See Kai Run are among her best sellers year after year. \u201cThey have a functional soft sole and the styles are very nice,\u201d she says. \u201cThe colors are more muted and it\u2019s a good first walker shoe. They\u2019re also cut a little wider.\u201d According to May, many children have wide feet so it makes sense that these roomier shoes are comfortable on kids\u2019 feet. $36 at Zappos Buy\n\nThese two pairs both recall Bensimons, those dainty French Converse-like shoes. The KaMiaos come recommended by PR agency Project MM\u2019s Meredith Winfrey, whose 2-year-old has gone through several pairs since he started walking. \u201cThey are cheap, easy to slip on and off, fine with no socks in the summer, cute with socks in the winter and look like new after going through the washing machine,\u201d she says. They\u2019re available in a bunch of fun colors and patterns. Ashley Melone, the co-founder of nursing friendly clothing line Madri Collection, recommends the similar-looking pair from Cienta Distressed after buying them for her daughter. \u201cI love the Cienta Distressed Canvas Slip Ons for my toddler. Slip-on shoes that she can wear comfortably without socks make getting out the door that much simpler.\u201d Melone adds that they have a \u201ctimeless\u201d look and goes with just about every outfit.\n\nGEOX Kalispera 19 High Top Sneaker (Toddler) Here\u2019s another pair of sneakers that offer solid support for young walkers, which came recommended by Peggy Economou of maternity brand Teat & Cosset. She told us she prefers quality over style for children\u2019s shoes, and particularly loves this pair because it offers both. \u201cThey are great quality, ergonomic, have a leather breathable insole \u2014 and also cute,\u201d Economou says. The quilted, patent-leather-like sneakers have a side zipper, allowing for easy-on-off. $70 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nNike Kids Tanjun (Infant/Toddler) Moloco also recommends these Nike sneakers with velcro, saying, \u201cI always found them the most supportive.\u201d In addition to being easy to take on and off, the Tanjuns have a mesh upper for breathability. \u201cWe loved these and wore various pairs through lots of different sizes.\u201d They\u2019re also available in little kid and big kid sizes \u2014 but without the velcro closure. $45 at Zappos Buy\n\nNike Air Max 270 RT (Infant/Toddler) Here\u2019s another pair from Nike that got shouted out as a comfortable choice for little feet. \u201cMy favorite sneakers for my kids are Nike Air Maxs,\u201d says Tara Foley, founder of non-toxic beauty company Follain. \u201cI have the same ones, so I know from personal experience that they\u2019re super cushy and have the perfect amount of height.\u201d She likes that the kid\u2019s version have \u201cgreat elastic laces that I find way better than velcro straps or regular laces.\u201d They\u2019re also seriously cute. Nike also makes Air Maxes for all ages and sizes (albeit in slightly different styles), so the entire family can match. $70 at Nike Buy\n\nReebok Classic Leather (Toddler) \u201cI absolutely love Reebok\u2019s Classics for my pre-schooler,\u201d says Danielle Walish, Madri\u2019s other co-founder. \u201cFor the spring I ordered her a pair of the Classic Leathers in white and for the fall we changed to black with the gum bottoms.\u201d She says that the retro look is especially cute on tiny feet. Like Nike, Reebok makes this style for older kids and adults as well. $40 at Reebok Buy\n\nBest sneakers for kids between 4 and 8\n\nNike Huarache Extreme Sneaker (Little Kid/Big Kid) $60 (was $100, now 40% off) Like infants and toddlers, little kids also benefit from easy-on shoes, as May notes: \u201cSneakers should be easy to put on and take off. Stretch and Velcro closures make it easy for kids.\u201d She like these pull-on shoes from Nike with two elastic straps that hold the shoe in place, a feature that Doyle also recommends, saying that parents should always look for a \u201cshoe that keeps the foot in it and is secure.\u201d We\u2019re a fan of the adult version as a women\u2019s athletic shoe, and the kids\u2019 model comes in just as many fun colorways. $60 at Kids Foot Locker Buy\n\nNew Balance Kids 680v5 Hook and Loop (Little Kid/Big Kid) $36 (was $50, now 28% off) For kids with wide feet, May likes that New Balance offers well-made shoes in a variety of widths, like this pair, which could pass as a grown-up shoe, sans velcro. $36 at Zappos Buy\n\nAdidas Kids Stan Smith Shoes (Little Kid) Oakes and Eunice Byun, the CEO and co-founder of direct-to-consumer kitchenware company Material, both swear by Stan Smiths for their kiddos \u2014 but with velcro, of course. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy for kids to manage the new task of putting on and taking off shoes without bothering with tying laces,\u201d says Byun. Oakes agrees that no-tie shoes are the way to go, saying, \u201cI was never the mom who wanted to deal with typing up laces.\u201d Stan Smiths of course come in styles with just laces, which may be a better fit for older kids. $55 at Adidas Buy\n\nVeja Esplar Hi-Top Leather Trainers Fuchsia Another on-trend velcro option, especially if you want to get your kid in on the Veja cult. These delightful high-tops are part of a collaboration between the French brand and children\u2019s site Smallable, and come recommended by Ariane Goldman, the founder and CEO of maternity brand HATCH, who says \u201cthe pinks are as cool as it gets.\u201d Goldman also loves the velcro straps, \u201cso my girls can get in and out of them by themselves.\u201d If this particular pair doesn\u2019t work for you, there\u2019s a ton more available for both boys and girls ages 2 to 8. $92 at Smallable Buy\n\nVans Kids Classic Slip-On (Little Kid/Big Kid) For a no-fuss shoe, Maisonette co-founder Sylvana Ward-Durrett loves Vans slip-ons because, as their name implies, they\u2019re so easy for kids to slip on and off. She also notes that \u201cthey\u2019re the perfect price point for the wear and tear of the week.\u201d They\u2019re available in all sizes, so you can wear the adult version to match your little one when you feel like twinning. $35 at Zappos Buy\n\nBest sneakers for kids between 8 and 12\n\nAsics Kids Gel-Contend 4 GS (Big Kid) Unlike the unstructured, barefoot style shoes Doyle recommends for younger kids, she says that \u201cas they get older and closer to their adult body weight, it\u2019s okay to have a shoe that equally distributes load and absorbs shock\u201d like a traditional running shoe. As kids enter middle school and pick up track, cross country, or other sports that involve running, she says these more specialized shoes help prevent stress fractures and calluses. With the same cushioning technology found in the brand\u2019s adult shoes, Asics shoes are a good choice for active kids in this age group. Fauci calls the Gel-Contend \u201ca very stable shoe.\u201d From $60 at Amazon Buy From $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nAdidas Swift Run J Sneaker Toward the tail end of elementary school kids may start to prioritize aesthetics in their sneakers. \u201cAdidas is doing a great job with styles right now,\u201d says May. She suggests this pair that\u2019s flexible and breathable while also being stylish. As long as the shoe fits correctly and is functional, it\u2019s generally fine to let a kid pick a pair based on looks. Doyle says this is true even for the one-in-five kids who have flat or collapsed arches. \u201cDon\u2019t get a shoe to accommodate a flat foot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that it\u2019s a normal variant within foot shape.\u201d From $65 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nPuma Kids Uprise Knit (Big Kid) Fauci says Puma knit sneakers, with their sock-like fit, are \u201creally trendy\u201d among older kids. The pull-on, fitted style requires a little extra dexterity than most younger kids can handle on their own, so she recommends these for the 8-and-up set. From $24 at Amazon Buy From $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nChampion Boys Rally Pro Big C Knit Sock Top Sneaker Here\u2019s another super on-trend knit style recommended by Liza Bychkov-Suloti, an on-air style expert and partner at integrated marketing and PR agency SHADOW. \u201cChampion makes low-top and high-top sneakers I adore, that are supportive and great quality, but also \u2018outfit-of-the-day\u2019 worthy,\u201d she says. Bychkov-Suloti adds that the sock-style sneakers are \u201cboth cool and durable,\u201d while also allowing kids who can\u2019t yet tie their own laces to slip them on themselves. $84 at Amazon Buy $84 at Amazon Buy\n\nPuma Kids Spirit TT (Little Kid/Big Kid) While Doyle generally stresses comfort and affordability for shoes kids will quickly grow out of, she makes an exception for kids who are starting to play sports on turf fields. Compared to regular cleats designed for playing on grass, the nubs on turf shoes \u2014 like this Puma pair \u2014 are lower profile and clustered closer together. \u201cTurf shoes produce less torque so there\u2019s less chance of twisting at the knee,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cIt\u2019s worth the investment of getting turf cleats in addition to regular cleats depending on what surface your kid will be playing on.\u201d From $11 at Amazon Buy From $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
