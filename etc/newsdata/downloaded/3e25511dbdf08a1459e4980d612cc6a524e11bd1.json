The Maple Leafs and Red Wings iced lineups that could resemble their regular-season rosters.\n\nToronto opens the regular season against the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday night.\n\nRieder, Lucic lead Flames past Oilers\n\nTobias Rieder scored a pair of goals against his former team to lead the Calgary Flames to a 3-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers in the final pre-season game for both clubs.\n\nMaking a bid to crack Calgary's lineup after finishing with no goals and 11 assists in 67 games with the Oilers last season, Rieder scored in the second period and then notched the game-winning goal at 14:21 of the third.\n\nMilan Lucic, who the Flames acquired in July in a deal that saw fellow veteran forward James Neal go the other way to the Oilers, also scored for Calgary, while goalie David Rittich stopped 26-of-28 shots.\n\nGaetan Haas and Zack Kassian scored for the Oilers, while goalie Mikko Koskinen made 19 saves\n\nJust two minutes into the game, Rittich made a pad save to stop a shot off the stick of Tomas Jurco before also turning aside a point-blank attempt by Markus Granlund about 60 seconds later.\n\nAlthough the Flames outshot the Oilers 9-3 in the opening period, they weren't able to get any pucks past Koskinen. Mikael Backlund had the best chance during a power play for the Flames, but Koskinen made a nice stick save to stop the Calgary forward's slapshot.\n\nNick Suzuki, Habs down Sens in OT\n\nProspect Nick Suzuki scored in overtime to give the Montreal Canadiens a 4-3 win over the Ottawa Senators in the final pre-season game for both teams.\n\nPhillip Danault, Tomas Tatar and Brendan Gallagher scored in regulation for the Canadiens (5-2-0). Back after missing two games with a bruised left hand, Carey Price stopped 35-of-37 shots.\n\nBobby Ryan, Anthony Duclair and Filip Chlapik scored for the Senators (3-3-0). Backup Anders Nilsson made 31 saves.\n\nWith the score tied 2-2 late in the third, Chlapik gave Ottawa the lead by easily intercepting an errant pass from Price with 2:17 left in the game.\n\nThe Canadiens then pulled Price and scored with the extra attacker when Gallagher deflected Jeff Petry's point shot between Nilsson's pads and in with 58 seconds on the clock.\n\nSuzuki scored the winner with 56 seconds left in OT on a wraparound, his first of the pre-season.\n\nWATCH | Habs' Suzuki beats Sens in OT:", "description": "Auston Matthews had a goal and two assists, while Frederik Andersen made 16 saves as the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Detroit Red Wings 5-0 in the final pre-season game for both teams on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301799.1569721359!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/leafs-wings-092819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
