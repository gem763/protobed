This is in response to the will and demand of the thousands of Lebanese demanding change,\" he added.\n\nDefying pleas from the country's top politicians, protesters on Tuesday sought to keep Lebanon on lockdown by cutting off access to some of the main thoroughfares, including the main north-south highway.\n\nEarlier in the day, people believed to be supporters of Hezbollah and its ally Amal forced protesters from a roadblock they had set up in Beirut, tearing down their tents and fighting with them, forcing the police to intervene.\n\n'Huge victory'\n\nThe two-week crisis has paralysed Lebanon, closing banks, schools and some businesses. Lebanon's banking association said banks would remain shut on Tuesday for a tenth straight working day, but added that the central bank had provided the liquidity necessary to pay out salaries for public sector workers, including members of security forces.\n\nHariri's resignation would be seen as defying the powerful Shia group Hezbollah, whose leader Hassan Nasrallah has twice said he was against such a step, citing the risk of a dangerous void.\n\nOn Monday, Aoun said he was \"following developments\".\n\nRami Khouri, a senior public policy fellow and journalism professor at the American University of Beirut, described Hariri's move as a \"huge victory\" for the protest movement and a \"critical turning point\".\n\nHe added, however, that the prime minister was the \"weakest link\" in the country's coalition government, which grouped nearly all of Lebanon's main parties, including the powerful Hezbollah.\n\n\"He was the low-hanging fruit who was likely to resign,\" Khouri said.\n\n\"The question now is will this trigger a process by which Hezbollah, which is the critical player in the background, as well as the president and his party ... will those people agree to a technocratic government, which goes on to the next step of the demands of the protesters?\"", "description": "PM heading to presidential palace to tender gov't resignation amid mass protests demanding departure of ruling elite.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/c519ea3d3ac1446e99bb723cdfeefd7e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
