His one-out single in the seventh put the Mets ahead 1-0 and Brandon Nimmo added a sacrifice fly.\n\nJeff Brigham (3-2) recorded the final out of the seventh. Jose Urena earned his third save with a one-hit ninth.\n\nDean\u2019s one-out double in the second provided the Marlins\u2019 only baserunner through six innings against Wheeler, who has spent his entire seven-year career with the Mets.\n\nMarlins starter Jordan Yamamoto allowed one hit and walked three while striking out a career-high 10 over six innings. He allowed two hits or fewer in six of his 15 starts this season.\n\nALONSO\u2019S A LEADER \u2026AND A LEADOFF MAN?\n\nMets manager Mickey Callaway said he and bench coach Jim Riggleman have discussed batting Pete Alonso first over the weekend in order to give the slugger additional chances to tie or break Aaron Judge\u2019s single-season rookie home run record of 52. Alonso is one homer shy of matching Judge after striking out in all four plate appearances.\n\nCallaway said his biggest concern is accidentally hurting Alonso\u2019s chances by putting him into the unfamiliar spot atop the lineup.\n\nCallaway said Riggleman has tried that in the past during his managerial stints.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it puts you in a position where you\u2019re kind of uncomfortable. So all of a sudden, you\u2019re leading off and you\u2019ve never done it before. And we don\u2019t want Pete to feel that,\u201d Callaway said.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying if I talk to him after tonight that it\u2019s not possible, because it could happen,\u201d he said.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: Yamamoto made his second start since missing almost a month with a right forearm strain.\n\nMets: OF/1B Dominic Smith (left foot) was activated from the 60-day injured list. Smith, who hasn\u2019t played since July 26, will likely be limited to pinch-hitting and defensive replacement duties down the stretch. INF/OF Jeff McNeil (broken right ulna) was placed on the 60-day IL. . 2B Robinson Cano left the game after being hit in the right arm by a pitch in the eighth inning.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: RHP Pablo Lopez (5-8, 4.96 ERA) will look to earn his first win since June 15 when he closes out his season in the opener of a three-game series at Philadelphia.\n\nMets: RHP Marcus Stroman (9-13, 3.23 ERA) will make his 11th start since being acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays on July 28.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Curtis Granderson, Tyler Heineman and Austin Dean hit late home runs and the Miami Marlins rallied against Zack Wheeler to beat the New York Mets 4-2 Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerry Beach"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/marlins_mets_baseball_53139_c0-137-3286-2052_s1770x1032.jpg?330a5723a7e98cf608ed78020352f0aead6f7cb8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
