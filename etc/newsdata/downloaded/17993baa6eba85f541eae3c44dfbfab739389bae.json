Though many thought of that day as a joke, people still fear the worse is coming. With so much happening in the world, from hurricanes and earthquakes, many foresee the end happening sooner than later.\n\nBut what is being done to help people prepare for doomsday scenarios?\n\nOne business in particular called, The Vivos Group, is taking doomsday survival to a whole new level. Robert Vicino, president of The Vivos Group, joined Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move to discuss his bunker business.\n\nSo who is actually buying these bunkers in anticipation of the end of the world?\n\n\u201cYour neighbor. While we do have some elite members, including some well-known movie stars, we got people from all different classes. Lower, middle and so on,\u201d said Vicino. \u201cWe\u2019re bombarded with interest but the truth is the majority can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nVivos is known as the world\u2019s largest shelter provider with luxurious accommodations that include a living space, bedrooms, kitchens, pools, theaters and anything other amenity you can think of. A bunker costs $35,000, according to Vicino, adding that \u201cyou can put as many people in it as you want.\u201d He estimates 24 people is the maximum number of people you can fit in one bunker.\n\nA luxurious bedroom located at Vivos complex in Germany called 'Vivos Europa'. More\n\nThe underground bunker complexes are located in South Dakota, Germany and other parts of the United States. One complex, located in the southwestern part of South Dakota is called \u2018The Vivos XPoint\u201d. It is described to be the size of Manhattan with over 575 private bunkers and can accommodate up to 5,000 people. Another complex called \u201cVivos Europa,\u201d which is bored into a mountain in central Germany, is about 250,000-plus square feet.\n\nThe bunkers are designed to protect people from any catastrophic event. They were built by the military back in 1942 to house bombs and are made of concrete and steel. The structures are buried under Earth and there\u2019s more than enough protection from radiation. They are not in any earthquake zones, all of Vivos\u2019 bunkers around the world are \u201cin one of the safest zones in North America and that\u2019s why the army chose it and that\u2019s why we chose it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re designed to survive any threat... but nothing is going to survive a direct asteroid impact,\u201d Vicino said, \u201cBut... what are the odds.\u201d\n\nRalston Ramsay is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nThis company lets you invest in fine art for as little as ... - Yahoo Finance\n\nNow men can customize suits by using an AI-powered \"Style Wall\"\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The Vivos Group President Robert Vicino joins Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move to discuss the his bunker business.", "authors": ["Ralston Ramsay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3BaIBGRBF_RLf41kfOHKTQ--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xNjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/b2e7e1a0-d0e5-11e9-bd77-ef3cd1c329cb", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
