They have been placed on the same Entity List as Chinese telecom giant Huawei, meaning U.S. companies are barred from doing business with them without a license.\n\nThe list includes eight of China\u2019s biggest technology companies, all of whom have well-documented links to surveillance in Xinjiang province or products that target Uighurs.\n\n\u201cThese entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups,\u201d the Commerce Department bulletin said.\n\nThe move comes just days before officials from Beijing are due in Washington to restart stalled trade talks.\n\nChina reacted angrily to the latest sanctions, and dismissed the allegations that the firms were involved in a brutal crackdown against ethnic Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province.\n\nREAD: Inside China\u2019s hidden war on Uighurs\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as these so-called 'human rights issues' as claimed by the United States,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cThese accusations are nothing more than an excuse for the United States to deliberately interfere in China's internal affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge the U.S. side to immediately correct its mistake, withdraw the relevant decision, and stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Geng added.\n\nWhen asked if China would retaliate, Geng simply said, \u201cStay tuned.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese companies hit by the latest sanctions have also come out strongly against the Commerce Department\u2019s decision.\n\nREAD: Uighur parents say China is ripping their children away and brainwashing them\n\nSenseTime, an AI company valued at $7 billion, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the Department of Commerce's decision and rejected allegations it had done anything wrong. Hikvision, makers of high-tech surveillance equipment, said it \u201cstrongly opposes today\u2019s decision by the U.S. government\u201d claiming the firm \u201crespects human rights and takes our responsibility to protect people in the U.S. and the world seriously.\u201d\n\nBeijing has constructed an elaborate surveillance infrastructure in Xinjiang province, claiming it is part of the fight against Islamic extremism among the Uighurs. Central to this are vast internment camps that China calls \u201cvocational training centres.\u201d Testimony from people who have escaped these camps details systemic abuse and torture at the hands of Chinese authorities.\n\nCover: In this Aug. 20, 2018, photo, Meripet, 29, prays at her home in Istanbul, Turkey. Meripet came to Turkey in February 2017 to visit her sick father, leaving four children behind. While in Turkey, she heard Uighur passports were being seized and that people who had gone abroad were being taken to reeducation, so she stayed in Turkey, giving birth to Abduweli. She hasn't seen her other four children since, and heard they were taken to a live-in kindergarten in Hotan, China.
