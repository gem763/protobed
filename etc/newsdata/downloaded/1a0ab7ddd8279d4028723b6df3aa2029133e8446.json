The apps, Sun Pro Beauty Camera and Funny Sweet Beauty Selfie Camera, had been downloaded over 1.5 million times, ZDNet reports.\n\nSun Pro Beauty camera has been in the Play Store for two years, and Funny Sweet Beauty Selfie Camera has been around for 6 months. If you\u2019re one of those 1.5 million that downloaded the apps you should uninstall them from your device now.\n\nBeyond just an adware issue, the apps also ask for a number of unnecessary permissions that could allow them to do more malicious things tan just serve you ads.\n\nSpecifically, the apps have requested permission to record audio and listen to anything that\u2019s being said around the device at any time. Both apps are also using a tool that prevents the APK from being unwrapped an analysed. While that\u2019s not a sign specifically that the app\u2019s creators had malicious intent, it\u2019s not great either.\n\nThe news is also a good reminder to make sure you\u2019re paying attention to what permissions an app is asking for on your phone before you install it. I something is asking for access that you don\u2019t think it needs, then you may want to reconsider installing an app in the first place.", "description": "Google removed two apps from the Google Play Store this week after it discovered they were serving adware to users.
