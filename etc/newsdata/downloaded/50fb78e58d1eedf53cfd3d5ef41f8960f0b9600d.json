To me it was lies,\" he said.\n\nImage caption The Financial Services Ombudsman said it had received 2,000 complaints about solar panels\n\nAn independent survey of Mr Thompson's system showed even after 20 years the income from the panels would not cover the cost of the loan.\n\nBarclays offered him some compensation but Mr Thompson said it was not enough.\n\nPV Solar UK went into liquidation in 2017.\n\nRobert Skillen, who was the director of the firm when Mr Thompson bought his system, said Mr Thompson's panels would make him money.\n\nMr Skillen is now in business claiming to help people who have been missold solar panels. He did not want to be interviewed.\n\nTony Walch, from Bolton, was told he would be better off by \u00a330,000 over 20 years when he bought solar panels from MyPlanet.\n\nHe said: \"They were very, very persuasive. Everything they said was plausible. It was a no-brainer.\"\n\nImage caption Tony Walch said everything he was told was plausible\n\nHe took out a loan of \u00a315,000 but he said the panels did not generate the amount of electricity he was promised. They also overheated, damaging the equipment, and he believed they had cost him more than \u00a3500 a year.\n\nMyPlanet went into liquidation in 2016.\n\nFormer director Mark Bonifacio said all calculations had been made using strict methodology, and the performance of the systems was impossible to predict because of different factors affecting performance.\n\nHe said MyPlanet installed more than 15,000 systems, and customers would be getting free electricity.\n\nDebbie Enever, from the Financial Ombudsman Service, said: \"We have got about 2,000 complaints about solar panels at the moment and more coming through every week.\"\n\nLoans for solar panels were taken out through Barclays Bank, which said: \"We always seek to ensure customers are satisfied with our financial products. Where customers have cause to complain we will review each case individually.\"\n\nYou can see more on this story on Inside Out North East & Cumbria on Monday 9 September at 19:30 BST.", "description": "People who took out large loans say the thousands of pounds in savings they were promised have not materialised.", "authors": ["Ed Hanson", "Bbc Inside Out", "North East"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0E8A/production/_108622730_brianthompson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
