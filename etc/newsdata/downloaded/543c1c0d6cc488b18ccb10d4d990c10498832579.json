He is serving a 7\u00bd -year term in a federal prison in Pennsylvania for federal bank and tax fraud convictions. (Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nIn his quest to rewrite the history of the 2016 election, President Trump\u2019s personal attorney has turned to an unusual source of information: Trump\u2019s imprisoned former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani in recent months has consulted several times with Manafort through the federal prisoner\u2019s lawyer in pursuit of information about a disputed ledger that would bolster his theory that the real story of 2016 is not Russian interference to elect Trump, but Ukrainian efforts to support Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe relationship, which Giuliani acknowledged in an interview this week with The Washington Post, stems from a shared interest in a narrative that undermines the rationale for the special counsel investigation. That inquiry led to Manafort\u2019s imprisonment on tax and financial fraud allegations related to his work in Kiev for the political party of former president Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s effort is gaining traction on Capitol Hill. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, have announced their renewal of an inquiry into any coordination between Ukraine and Democratic Party officials.\n\nManafort, who is serving a 7\u00bd -year term in a federal prison in Pennsylvania, has continued to express support for Trump, and Trump has never ruled out giving him a pardon.\n\nTrump\u2019s push on a July 25 call to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the matter, and also probe former vice president Joe Biden, triggered an impeachment inquiry in the House. Many of the accusations Giuliani has been making about Ukraine recycle those that Manafort\u2019s team first promulgated.\n\nGiuliani joined Trump\u2019s legal team in April 2018 to help defend the president against special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe, and the former mayor said he launched his own investigation into Ukraine late last year, which led him to consult with Manafort. He said he has not spoken directly to Manafort in two years.\n\n\u201cIt was that I believed there was a lot of evidence that the [Democratic National Committee] and the Clinton campaign had a close connection to Ukrainian officials,\u201d Giuliani said, noting that he was never advocating for a pardon of Manafort. \u201cIt was all about Trump. I don\u2019t think I could exonerate Manafort.\u201d\n\nManafort\u2019s lawyer, Kevin Downing, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n[Impeachment inquiry puts new focus on Giuliani\u2019s work for prominent figures in Ukraine]\n\nGiuliani said his consultation with Manafort centered on trying to ascertain the veracity of a secret black ledger obtained by Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which the New York Times revealed in an August 2016 story. The Times said the ledger recorded $12.7 million in cash payments from Yanukovych\u2019s political party to Manafort. The revelation led Manafort to resign from the campaign.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s narrative recasts Ukrainian accusations in 2016 against Manafort and efforts by Democratic operatives to gather research on Manafort after he took a leading role in Trump\u2019s campaign as a conspiracy involving both Ukrainian and American officials to swing the election for Clinton.\n\nAs part of that, Giuliani has focused on a theory that Manafort\u2019s team was promoting as early as 2017: that the Ukrainian government separately interfered in the 2016 campaign on behalf of Clinton through the activities of a Ukrainian American contract worker for the DNC, Alexandra Chalupa.\n\nChalupa confirmed she worked part-time as an outreach worker for the DNC to Ukrainian Americans and others, and met with Ukrainian officials from the embassy in Washington during that time. She said she \u201csounded the alarm\u201d on Manafort outside her duties for the DNC, and sought to circulate that information, because she said she was concerned about Manafort\u2019s ties to Yanukovych, who was backed by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. She said the Ukrainian Embassy stayed clear of U.S. election matters, even with regard to Manafort.\n\n\u201cThe White House has been pushing this narrative to distract from Donald Trump\u2019s gross abuse of power in pressuring a foreign country to interfere in our elections,\u201d DNC press secretary Adrienne Watson said in a statement.\n\nThere were Ukrainian Americans and people in the Ukrainian anti-corruption movement who were motivated to \u201cshine a light\u201d on Manafort\u2019s activities in Ukraine during 2016, and some Ukrainian Americans were active on behalf of Clinton, said Jeffrey Mankoff, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, but he said those activities aren\u2019t equivalent to Russia\u2019s state-sponsored intervention, which included the release of stolen emails and an extensive online disinformation campaign.\n\n\u201cOne theory has been documented with extensive detail in the Mueller Report,\u201d Mankoff said. \u201cThe other is something that Rudy Giuliani and people in his orbit have conjured up as a way to cast aspersions and confuse the story.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he needed to consult with Manafort through the latter\u2019s lawyer this spring to ask whether a black ledger ever existed.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Was there really a black book? If there wasn\u2019t, I really need to know. Please tell him I\u2019ve got to know,\u2019\u201d Giuliani recalled asking Manafort\u2019s lawyer. \u201cHe came back and said there wasn\u2019t a black book.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he was interested in the matter to prove his theory that the ledger\u2019s release, which he has claimed was done in conjunction with U.S. officials, was part of a falsified pretext for U.S. authorities to reopen a case against Manafort.\n\nThe FBI, however, already had a case open against Manafort before the 2016 campaign, having interviewed him twice about his work in Ukraine in 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office did not introduce the \u201cblack ledger\u201d at Manafort\u2019s trial in Virginia in August 2018, nor did Manafort's defense team mention the document during his trial on tax and financial fraud charges, or try to show that it had been forged.\n\nAfter a jury convicted Manafort of eight felonies, the former Trump campaign chairman pleaded guilty in Washington to avoid a second trial. As part of his plea, Manafort acknowledged that he made more than $60 million in Ukraine, laundering more than $30 million of it through foreign companies and bank accounts to hide it from the IRS and cheating the government out of $15 million in taxes. He also agreed that he had lobbied in the United States on behalf of Ukrainian officials without registering and that he conspired to tamper with witnesses in his case.\n\nSerhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian journalist, anti-corruption campaigner and former member of parliament, said the ledger \u201cwas obtained by an anonymous source in the burned-out ruins of the headquarters of Yanukovych\u2019s party.\u201d His involvement in the release of part of its contents at a news conference, he said, was motivated by a desire that Manafort be brought to justice for his activities in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cGiuliani\u2019s entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts,\u201d Leshchenko said in an op-ed in The Post. \u201cGiuliani has developed a conspiracy theory in which he depicts my revelations about Manafort as an intervention in the 2016 U.S. election in favor of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nIn a text conversation with Manafort from August 2017 released by prosecutors, Fox News host Sean Hannity mentions \u201cUkraine interference\u201d as one of the issues he was highlighting to attack Mueller. On his show that year, Hannity repeatedly claimed Ukraine had intervened in the 2016 election by sharing information on Manafort with a DNC contractor. Manafort did not respond directly to those claims but frequently encouraged and praised Hannity throughout the summer.\n\nThe White House also promoted the allegation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for an example of a campaign coordinating with a foreign country or a foreign source, look no further than the DNC, who actually coordinated opposition research with the Ukrainian Embassy,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in July 2017.\n\nGrassley and Johnson, writing this week in a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr, again mentioned the allegations as a matter they intend to investigate.\n\n\u201cUkrainian efforts, abetted by a U.S. political party, to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cSuch allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempt to undermine our democratic processes,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter.\n\nRachel Weiner contributed to this report.", "description": "The president\u2019s attorney is promoting a narrative that the real story of 2016 is not Russian interference to elect Trump, but Ukrainian efforts to support Hillary Clinton.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Tom Hamburger", "Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money", "Politics In Washington", "Paul Sonne", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The U.S. Military", "Rosalind S.
