In the aftermath of the 2003 publication of Michael Lewis\u2019s \u201cMoneyball,\u201d Chass vociferously questioned how it was received in both in baseball front offices and the media. And he continued his broadsides against analytics after he took a buyout from the Times in 2008 and decamped for the Internet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would be better off playing a game of War with one of my grandchildren than reading about WAR,\u201d he once wrote on his website of the stat Wins Above Replacement, which has become a popular catch-all metric in modern baseball.\n\nKram, 25, now writes for the website The Ringer, often covering baseball in a style similar to the one derided by his grandfather. This summer, he wrote a story about the Astros, measuring their historical greatness with the help of a stat called Weighted Runs Created Plus.\n\n\u201cI tell him he shouldn\u2019t be using so many numbers,\u201d Chass said. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d\n\nDuring his long career at the Times \u2014 he started in 1970 covering the Yankees before moving to the national baseball beat \u2014 Chass was a pioneering baseball writer, covering the labor side of the sport as no one before him had, including the players\u2019 fight for free agency. In the 1970s and \u201880s, he practically created the granular beat of reporting on contracts and how much players made, which ultimately helped push salaries higher.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the later years of his career, Chass\u2019s fame took on a different dimension as he became an avatar for a group of older baseball reporters suspicious or openly hostile to the way the sport was changing. Chass\u2019s feuds with the new breed of writers were many and glorious.\n\nChass took shots at stats luminaries like Nate Silver (Silver once wrote an open letter to Chass at Baseball Prospectus), and at younger baseball writers like Rob Neyer and Craig Calcaterra. \u201cBloggers \u2026 are jealous of the baseball writers who get to vote [for the Hall of Fame],\u201d he once wrote. \u201cThey think they can do better, but they can\u2019t vote and it pains them.\u201d\n\nFire Joe Morgan, a website co-founded by TV writers Michael Schur and Alan Yang in the mid-2000s, made Chass a regular punching bag. One entry: \u201cI wonder if Murray Chass wakes up in the morning and thinks, Murray, old fella, today you\u2019re gonna write an article in a real special way \u2026 you\u2019re gonna take an idea that\u2019s been rattling around in the old upstairs for a while now (here\u2019s the idea: that that darn \u201cMoneyball\u201d book isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be) and then do your damndest to find evidence \u2014 any wisp of a scintilla of evidence \u2014 to support that idea.\u201d\n\nKram grew up in suburban Washington, D.C., a devoted baseball fan. He poured over boxscores in the morning Washington Post, and he often talked baseball with his grandfather, though he didn\u2019t read his columns religiously. He did, however, recall a period when he was not allowed to search for Chass\u2019s name on the Internet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t want me to see people wishing death upon my grandfather,\u201d Kram said.\n\nKram didn\u2019t plan to be a sportswriter, but when he went off to college at Washington University in St. Louis and got a laptop for the first time, he began reading websites like FanGraphs and Baseball Prospectus.\n\n\u201cI guess I probably started out skeptical because of my family, but it wasn\u2019t like I felt guilty reading them,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to learn.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, when Silver predicted all 50 states correctly in the presidential election, Kram became a bigger believer in the work Silver helped pioneer in sports. And as he read, Kram began to debate his grandfather on topics like the usefulness of the win statistic for a pitcher and why earned run average was an incomplete measure.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI remember going to his house for a Jewish holiday and he complained that the Warmongers \u2014 that\u2019s what he called people who liked WAR \u2014 had gotten to me,\u201d Kram said.\n\nAD\n\nKram became the editor of his college newspaper and afterward landed an internship at The Ringer when it launched in 2016, which led to a full-time job and mixed approval from his grandfather.\n\n\u201cZach is very smart, he knows baseball,\u201d Chass said. He added, \u201cThe problem with baseball writers today is they do don\u2019t do enough reporting. News is the most important thing, but so many writers are just making lists.\u201d\n\nAfter Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, Kram wrote a list of the heroes from the game, ranked.\n\nAD\n\nWhether grandfather and grandson have changed each other\u2019s minds at all depends who you ask. Kram believes WAR is still useful, as long as it isn\u2019t taken as gospel. He said he convinced Chass that Jacob deGrom was worthy of the Cy Young in 2018, despite only winning 10 games. \u201cMaybe he did, but I can\u2019t say I remember that,\u201d Chass said.\n\nAD\n\nWhere the duo does converge, though, is on how the statistical revolution has changed baseball, and in some ways for the worse. Chass bemoans a game so dependent on the home run, a development that seems to have been aided by the ball this year, but that is also the legacy of an analytics-driven game that values three true outcomes: Home runs, walks and pitchers\u2019 strikeouts. And Kram recognizes the impact of analytics on player movement and the balance of power between players and teams, an area Chass covered so thoroughly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some crotchety old-manness in there from someone who\u2019s been watching baseball for 40 years, in terms of enjoying the game,\u201d Kram said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not on an island.\u201d He added, \u201cAnalytics have definitely been behind the slow free agent movement and the fetishization of cost-controlled contracts. So one of the funniest things in the world is you have people who would be warring a decade ago agreeing on how sabermetrics have influenced the game.\u201d\n\nAnd regardless of whatever statistics Kram might argue with his grandfather about, there are always other reasons for them to talk baseball.\n\n\u201cWe bond over baseball history. He taught me to appreciate the labor history and its importance to coverage,\u201d Kram said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s not history for him. He was there.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Zach Kram, 25, writes for the website The Ringer, often covering baseball in a style similar to the one derided by his grandfather, Hall of Fame writer Murray Chass.", "authors": ["Ben Strauss", "Sports", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bFuiatrX0aECUV9fEBy2mN0hxUY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SSTX4SUAJNEGFNPLNREZ43SWRQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
