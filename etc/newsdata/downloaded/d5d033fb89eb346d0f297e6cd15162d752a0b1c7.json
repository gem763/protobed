She said parents should gently correct irrational fears but not downplay anxieties just to make children feel better. That could just make the child feel she can\u2019t trust adults to be honest with them on this topic.\n\n\u201cTalk about the problem, then pivot to the solution,\u201d Dr. Van Susteren said.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve discussed your child\u2019s climate fears, talk about people and organizations that are already working on large-scale climate solutions, said Maria Ojala, a psychologist at Orebro University in Sweden who studies young people and climate change.\n\nIf possible, talk about solutions in a personal context. Highlight steps you\u2019ve already taken as a family or as individuals to reduce your carbon footprints and brainstorm new ideas together. Taking action can be an empowering antidote to fear, Dr. Van Susteren said. Encourage your child to take action with her peers as well, like joining a group at school or volunteering with a local organization. Collective action has mental health benefits, according to Dr. Ojala. \u201cWe are social beings and it\u2019s very good for our well-being to work together with others and be part of a group,\u201d she said.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t get rid of your child\u2019s fears altogether, and that\u2019s O.K., Dr. Ojala said. The goal is to help your child cope with her fears in a constructive way to avoid hopelessness.\n\nFinally, think about your own personal choices and lead by example, Dr. Van Susteren said. Your children are probably watching.", "description": "Also this week, how we captured the stark beauty of ghost forests.", "authors": ["Jillian Mock", "Claire O Neill"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/climate/09cli-newsletter-talk/09cli-newsletter-talk-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
