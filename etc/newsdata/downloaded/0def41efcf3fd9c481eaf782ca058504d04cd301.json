Yet here\u2019s episode 509, and with two left before the series\u2019 end, it\u2019s Whitney\u2019s perspective that proves pivotal, illuminating, and ultimately fatal to Noah\u2019s cause.\n\nThis installment focuses on the day Noah gets his Me Too moment, when Vanity Fair publishes Petra\u2019s long-brewing expos\u00e9 before Noah fully prepares his family for what\u2019s going to happen. Appropriately, the episode puts the focus on arguably the two women who mean the most to him at this point \u2014 Helen and Whitney \u2014 and it\u2019s tough viewing to watch them grapple with their already-complicated feelings about Noah alongside these new allegations.\n\nThere are a lot of feelings to unpack (which is probably why this episode runs more than 15 minutes over), but we begin by picking up immediately after the end of episode 508, with Helen on the phone with Petra, answering what to her are a series of odd questions about her relationship with Noah. Only after she gets off the phone does Noah sheepishly acknowledge that the story might make him not look so good \u2014 though of course, because he still refuses to believe he did anything wrong, he fails to communicate the full extent of what\u2019s to come.\n\nHelen finds out the hard way, after driving through a gauntlet of judgmental looks from the other moms at school, that the Vanity Fair profile has been published, and it includes stories from six women (three anonymous) about Noah\u2019s, uh, \u201cbad boy\u201d behavior. \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m going to fucking kill you,\u201d Helen mutters as she makes him read the article out loud on her drive back to the house. You can hardly blame her.\n\nNoah and Helen meet up at home to continue fighting this out \u2014 Noah still insisting he\u2019s not to blame \u2014 but complicating the day is a phenomenon that\u2019s increasingly a part of daily life for Angelenos: A brush fire has shut down the city, meaning that when Trevor gets into a fight at school, Helen and Noah can\u2019t pick him and Stacey up themselves because of road closures. They experience a moment of panic when they can\u2019t figure out where their kids have gone, until Sasha Mann calls to say he picked up the kids and brought them to his house in Malibu. He\u2019s happy to send a helicopter for Helen to join them (the perks of dating a movie star), but Noah isn\u2019t welcome.\n\nAt Sasha\u2019s house, Helen realizes just how serious this situation with Noah is, especially as an effort is now being made to take his name off the Formerly Known As \u201cDescent\u201d Project, spearheaded by Sasha. At Sasha\u2019s urging, Helen releases a statement that gets brutally truncated by the publicist with the aim to distance Helen and the children from Noah \u2026 but everything changes as she watches Noah\u2019s former publicist Eden on a talk show discussing what happened. Remember how Eden told Noah in episode 8 that she hadn\u2019t contacted the reporter \u2014 the reporter contacted her? Yeah, that was because a few weeks earlier, Helen had made a comment to Sasha about how Eden had probably had sex with Noah during his book tour and Sasha made the connection.\n\nSo now Helen sees this nuclear meltdown of bad publicity as Sasha\u2019s manipulating the press to get Noah kicked off the movie, so she grabs her kids and takes Sasha\u2019s car and gets the hell out of there. But then it\u2019s Whitney\u2019s turn.\n\nThat day, Whitney is trying to fly home to L.A., but flights are being canceled (because of the fires) so she\u2019s alone in the airport when the Vanity Fair article breaks; a flood of text messages and calls keeps interrupting her attempts to read it. The one call she does take is from her former lover Furkat, whom she decides to meet up with instead of hanging out at JFK.\n\nThis proves to be a bad choice. Furkat initially seems thrilled to see her and is even enthusiastic about the news that she\u2019s getting married \u2026 until she pushes him about the night at the Chateau Marmont when he let his friend/financier watch them have sex. Then Furkat gets cold. It\u2019s quite a feat to watch a man simultaneously try to make it seem as if he\u2019s not exploiting a young woman while he 100 percent is threatening her career if she doesn\u2019t play along. The power differential between them is now even more askew thanks to his reminder that, because of her father, her career is pretty much dead (if we needed evidence of this, there\u2019s Helen losing her interior-design job earlier in the episode) \u2014 and he might be her only lifeline.\n\nWhen things go sour, Whitney\u2019s left to schlep back to the airport in a ride share (and gets so grossed out by her fellow passenger gazing at her cleavage that she buys a hoodie for the ride home). But an interesting confluence of events arises because she\u2019s on the same flight as Audrey, the woman who turned her spirit-breaking experience as one of Noah\u2019s students into a published memoir.\n\nThe conversation Whitney and Audrey have on the flight is dense and intense, bringing up a ton of questions that get into what happens when a person is dragged into the court of public opinion, especially regarding the collateral damage dealt to friends and family. But Audrey\u2019s bigger point \u2014 about how men like Noah are the enemies of a world where women like her and Whitney can have real, substantial power \u2014 makes an impact.\n\nWhen Whitney gets home, things really come together. First, she finally confesses her infidelity to Colin, and the ensuing fight ends with them more closely connected than ever. \u201cI need a green card because I fucking want to be with you,\u201d Colin yells, and after she sees the luminous portrait he has painted of her (perhaps the first time she\u2019s ever actually seen his art), she really believes him.\n\nThen, of course, Whitney\u2019s family storms in, with Helen putting the full blame on herself for Noah\u2019s disgrace, since she had tipped off Sasha to the fact that Eden might have a story worth telling. There\u2019s a lot of talking in this episode about some very complicated issues and some very complicated emotions \u2014 you know, The Affair\u2019s bread and butter. But the way things crystallize around a confession literally a decade overdue ultimately makes things very, very simple.\n\nIt\u2019d be nice, especially after watching Noah and Whitney bond in episode 507 over plans for her wedding, to forget that time, y\u2019know, when Noah accidentally hit on Whitney at an orgy. It might be years in the past, but the final season is the perfect time for a show like this to unearth these sorts of secrets and dole out the consequences. \u201cI saw the way you look at women \u2026 like they\u2019re prey,\u201d Whitney says of that night, and that one sentence from her does more damage in the long run than however many thousands of words Vanity Fair published.\n\nAs someone who has been covering this show since the beginning and has devoted thousands of words to shouting about how Noah might be the absolute worst, I find it fascinating to see the series engage with that to this degree. Like, this episode directly confronts how, in episode 504, Noah made out with Erica, the script supervisor, then stole her bra and left her naked in the yard! That was awful!\n\nThe Affair premiered years before powerful men became publicly accountable for their actions, so we shouldn\u2019t assume this was always a part of the endgame. But the way in which the show has brought forward characters it seemingly discarded years ago and has given them a moment to shout feels well justified.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Noah deserves to be burned at the stake. But while The Affair is all about multiple points of view, what\u2019s becoming clear this year is that some basic truths will find their way to the surface. And they might be inescapable.\n\nThere Is No Objective Truth (Just Bullet Points)\n\n\u2022 God, honestly, poor Trevor and Stacey, especially Stacey. The scene where she tells Erica\u2019s story to Helen is just heartbreaking.\n\n\u2022 When Helen initially presses Noah about the secrets Petra aims to dig up, his comment about how she learned \u201cnothing about weddings in Montauk, if that\u2019s what you mean, and she never will,\u201d was quite the underhanded blow.\n\n\u2022 Whenever we talk about the Me Too movement, it always feels important to mention that the term well predates the fall of 2017 and the Harvey Weinstein bombshells and that activist Tarana Burke doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit for launching the campaign in 2006.\n\n\u2022 Sierra is almost an afterthought this week, having enlisted Vik\u2019s mother, Priya, for help with the baby as she tries to sort out her situation with Child Protective Services. Season five has done a lot to try to help us understand her as a character, but with only two episodes left, it\u2019s hard to see what kind of end to her story is a happy one.\n\n\u2022 Did we miss 2053 Joanie this week? Maybe not, except her story\u2019s latest cliff-hanger is pretty crazy given how it ended with her and confessed murderer Ben face-to-face.\n\n\u2022 In case you were curious, the movie the Solloway children are watching before switching to Busy Philipps\u2019s talk show is either Kick-Ass or Kick-Ass 2 \u2014 I can\u2019t be sure given the amount of screen time, but Aaron Johnson\u2019s green costume is unmistakable.\n\n\u2022 Also, does The Affair take place in an alternate universe where Busy Tonight wasn\u2019t canceled in May 2019? (Presumably, the choice to make that the show on which Eden makes her explosive guest appearance was made before then.) For the record, Philipps was a solid talk-show host, and if The Affair does take place in an alternate universe, it\u2019d be a universe worth living in.", "description": "As Noah gets his Me Too moment, the women in his life grapple with their already-complicated feelings about him.
