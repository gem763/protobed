The measure will impose a curfew, prohibit demonstrations and make it easier for the armed forces to detain people. It must be approved by Congress.\n\n\u201cThese criminal groups operate throughout the region,\u201d Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales told a news conference.\n\nThe Guatemalan Army said a group of suspected drug traffickers on Tuesday \u201cambushed\u201d a patrol of nine soldiers who were sent to detain an aircraft allegedly transporting drugs.\n\nGuatemala, like neighboring El Salvador and Honduras, is a transit route for much of the cocaine that flows into the United States. Candidates running for public office in recent elections have been accused of links to the drug trafficking underworld.\n\nThe United Nations-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, which permanently closed its doors there on Tuesday, helped shed light on links between local politicians and organized crime and drug trafficking.\n\nThe CICIG, as the group is known, is widely viewed as one of the most successful anti-corruption bodies in Latin American history. It helped topple a president in 2015 and drew the ire of Morales after accusing him of breaking campaign finance laws.
