She took a second medical leave, and dropped out for good in January 2015.\n\nMs. Manning found solace in the theater, joining the Possibility Project , a nonprofit that uses the performing arts to help teenagers build relationships. She also found a crucial source of support in her third, and final, foster mother, Janice Harper.
