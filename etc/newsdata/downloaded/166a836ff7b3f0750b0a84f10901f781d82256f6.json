The bank is the largest dealer in US Treasury securities, making it a major player in the American investment market. Goldman Sachs even featured in the Great Recession of 2008 \u2013 but in a good way. The bank paid back its Federal bailout money (received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program) in full by June of 2009 \u2013 just 8 months after taking the loan.\n\nGoldman\u2019s reputation puts its analysts and bankers in high demand, and they have moved seamlessly between the financial and political worlds. Goldman employees have worked as financial advisors in the Treasury Department (current Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is a Goldman Sachs alumn), in the EU (European Central Bank President Mario Draghi came from Goldman Sachs), and in England (in the person of Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England). So, when a Goldman analyst speaks, investors will listen.\n\nIn the last few days, Goldman analysts have been speaking. Let\u2019s give a listen to what they\u2019ve been saying, and see how their stock picks measure up in TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nAllegheny Technologies (ATI)\n\nThe first stock on our list of Goldman picks holds a unique niche regarding modern technology and industry. Allegheny Technologies is a manufacturer of metal alloys, specialty metals, and complex metal components. The company\u2019s top market is the aerospace and defense industry, but Allegheny is present in the oil & gas sector, the automotive sector, and the electrical industry.\n\nSpecifically, ATI is a market leader in the production of nickel- and titanium-based alloys and superalloys, as well as various grades of stainless steel. The company is capable of unique forgings and precision machining in the manufacture of specialty metal parts. In short, Allegheny is indispensable in the most modern industry.\n\nAn essential niche is a good place to be, especially for an industrial company. Allegheny, based in western Pennsylvania, is seeing benefits from that. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn recently upgraded his firm\u2019s rating on the stock, from Neutral to Buy. His price target on the stock, $25, indicates confidence in a 24% upside potential. (To watch Korn's track record, click here)\n\nA stock upgrade is always a good thing. ATI got a quick jump in the markets after Korn said that, despite softness due to the Boeing 737 MAX grounding, the company\u2019s fundamental market remains intact. Over 50% of ATI\u2019s business is with the commercial aircraft industry, and Korn points out that globally, commercial demand for jet engines \u2013 and the specialty metals required in their manufacture \u2013 remains high.\n\nGetting to the bottom line, Korn says, \u201cATI is one of few stocks in our coverage with top-line growth that does not depend on a commodity price recovery. With solid upside potential and attractive valuation, we upgrade our rating to Buy.\u201d\n\nWhen looking at Wall Street\u2019s stance, Korn is not the only bull, as TipRanks analytics showcase ATI as a Buy. Out of 6 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 4 rate the stock a \"buy\", one says \"hold,\" while another one suggests \"sell.\" The 12-month average price target stands at $25.83 marking about 25% upside from where the stock is currently trading.
