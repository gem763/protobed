(The indefinite suspensions Wednesday of WNYC radio personalities Jonathan Schwartz and Leonard Lopate are only the latest examples.)\n\nAMI\u2019s stout defense of the 35-year-old Howard\u2014an Australian import who reportedly forced female employees to watch pornography and listen to him describing his sexual exploits and speculating about their sex lives, and nicknamed himself \u201cDildo\u201d while running AMI\u2019s Los Angeles office in 2012\u2014comes at an especially inopportune moment.\n\nTime magazine just named \u201cThe Silence Breakers\u201d\u2014that is, the army of women, and some men, who have gone public in recent weeks with the alleged misconduct of the likes of NBC\u2019s Mark Halperin, NPR\u2019s Michael Oreskes, and Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey, among many others\u2014as its 2017 Person of the Year.\n\nMeanwhile, Howard\u2019s past collaboration with Harvey Weinstein to discredit the movie mogul\u2019s accusers was front and center in Thursday\u2019s exhaustive New York Times report on how the Hollywood producer used his clout, connections and cash to thwart press investigations of alleged misconduct\u2014which Weinstein denies, claiming all his sexual encounters were consensual\u2014that ran the gamut from groping to rape.\n\nWith regard to Howard\u2019s activities on behalf of Weinstein, AMI has taken a more traditional stance, releasing a chagrined statement of innocence that places the blame on the mogul instead of its chief content officer: \u201cAMI apologizes for any part it unwittingly played in Mr. Weinstein\u2019s well documented manipulation of his business and personal relationships in his efforts to combat his accusers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in this environment that AMI spokesman Jon Hammond was toiling Tuesday to dismiss and deride the AP\u2019s report, based on interviews with 12 former employees, as the unfounded complaints of the \u201cdisgruntled.\u201d\n\nDitto an AMI lawyer, Cam Stracher, who minimized Howard\u2019s allegedly loutish behavior, which included expressing the desire to create a Facebook account for a female underling\u2019s vagina, as \u201cwhat you would call\u2026 horsing around outside the office, going to bars and things that are not uncommon in the media business.\u201d\n\nIn a brief phone interview with the AP, Howard himself called the complaints against him \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\nHoward\u2019s boss, AMI Chief Executive David Pecker, is a longtime Trump friend and ally who seems to have put the National Enquirer at the service of the candidate and now president\u2014weaponizing the supermarket tabloid against Trump\u2019s adversaries, whether it was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the Republican primaries or Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski as they ramped up their criticism of his presidency.\n\nIn this context, AMI\u2019s retort is decidedly Trumpian.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying it didn\u2019t happen, and if it happened, it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d said author and women\u2019s rights activist Jaclyn Friedman, whose latest book is titled Unscrewed: Women, Sex, Power, and How to Stop Letting the System Screw Us All.\n\n\u201cMaybe they were thinking, \u2018Look, who is the National Enquirer\u2019s audience?\u2019 They\u2019re more conservative folks, folks who aren\u2019t as well-educated perhaps. The Zeitgeist has not reached every corner of the United States. Who else is defying the Zeitgeist right now? Roy Moore is defying the Zeitgeist. Donald Trump is defying the Zeitgeist. The National Enquirer has a pretty accurate read on who their audience is, and they can get away with it.\u201d\n\nDawn Bridges, a former top communications executive for Time Inc., Al Jazeera America, and the music industry, told The Daily Beast: \u201cThis is sort of in the same vein as Dustin Hoffman saying this is what goes on during film productions, or Geraldo Rivera saying \u2018the news business is a very flirty business.\u2019 But things have changed\u2026 I spent my twenties in the 1990s running around the world with rock stars and the stuff that went on then would not pass muster today. The old-world rules don\u2019t apply today.\u201d\n\nFormer Time Warner executive Ed Adler, a partner in the PR powerhouse Finsbury, called AMI\u2019s response to the AP\u2019s report \u201can extreme outlier\u201d compared to how other media companies such as NBC Universal and CBS, among others, have handled such allegations.\n\nYet, against all odds and the consensus view of the media elite, defiance and denial worked like a charm for Trump during the presidential campaign, when he brushed aside the multiple allegations of sexual harassment and assault of nearly two dozen women.\n\n\u201cA PR expert would never have recommended the things that Trump has said and done over the last year and half,\u201d Adler told The Daily Beast. \u201cThings that you would prescribe as the right way to handle certain issues are not accepted by everyone in today\u2019s media world. If you analyze what Trump has done or said, a PR expert would never have recommended it, but it seems to have worked for him.\u201d\n\nReferring to the Times account of Howard\u2019s collaboration with Weinstein, Dawn Bridges said, \u201cThe National Enquirer has never been held up as paragon of great American world-class journalism, and they\u2019re already in the middle of this particular story. Not to express a bit more sensitivity to the situation, given everything that\u2019s going on at the moment, seems a bit surprising.\u201d\n\nBridges added, however, that by deriding the allegations against Howard, AMI could be following the playbook that has worked for Trump during his four decades as a tabloid-ready public figure.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the Trump philosophy\u2014ride out the Access Hollywood scandal because the core Trump supporters weren\u2019t going to change their opinion of Trump or their hatred of Hillary because of the tape,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cMaybe the core National Enquirer audience doesn\u2019t care about journalistic purity, and maybe all of this is just inside baseball for people in New York media circles.\u201d", "description": "The Trump-aligned media company says its chief content officer, who called himself \u2018Dildo,\u2019 was just \u2018horsing around\u2019 when \u2018disgruntled employees\u2019 alleged he harassed them.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1512615515/171206-grove-dylan-howard-tease_esljuw", "published_at": "2017-12-07"}
