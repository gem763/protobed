Our private discussion, in his office with the door closed, began with Andrew\u2019s remarks that because I was married, I wouldn\u2019t want to continue working as hard as I had been. That as a wife, I\u2019d be focused on my new life.\u201d\n\nWatkins is expected to appear at a public hearing on pay equity in New York City on Thursday night, which is hosted by the NYC Commission on Gender Equity, the Commission on Human Rights and the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. The co-chair of the Commission on Gender Equity is Chirlane McCray, the wife of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is also running for president.\n\nAccording to Watkins, Yang had promoted her to senior director shortly after he started at Manhattan Prep and she had \u201chit all of [her] growth targets.\u201d As an at-will employee, she could be terminated at any time, and Watkins says that she received a monthly payment for two years after she was fired. Manhattan Prep was acquired by test-prep giant Kaplan in 2009, and Yang walked away with what he described as \u201csome number in the millions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the termination was couched for me, as a \u2018freedom to move on\u2019 narrative, the deal Andrew Yang offered me was commensurate with what he believed I deserved, a monthly payment for no longer working,\u201d writes Watkins. \u201cSounds a lot like Yang\u2019s \u2018freedom dividend\u2019 platform doesn\u2019t it?... Rather than governing our way into a sustainable economy, Yang\u2019s plan absolves the government from overseeing companies that could render countless workers obsolete.\u201d\n\nHuffPost has not independently verified Watkin\u2019s account at this time. We have reached out to the Yang campaign and Manhattan Prep for comment and will update this piece accordingly.\n\nIn 2017, women were nearly twice as likely to report an experience of gender discrimination at work. Big life changes, like marriage and child-rearing, also play a role in the conversation about the gender pay gap. In a 2016 Pew survey, mothers were twice as likely as fathers to report that taking time off after the birth or adoption of a child negatively impacted their career.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Yang has been outspoken about pay inequity, specifically about the role that gender plays in that inequity.\n\n\u201cWe have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses,\u201d he said during the July 31 Democratic presidential debate. \u201cWe know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society. It will not change unless we change it.\u201d\n\nHis campaign website also has a policy page on the fight for equal pay.", "description": "The 2020 presidential candidate allegedly told Kimberly Watkins she \"wouldn't want to continue working as hard.\"", "authors": ["Senior Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83d137230000100558308d.jpeg?cache=fxubscowj5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
