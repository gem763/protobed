Several shots were fired and one person was slightly injured, but the suspect was held down by others in the mosque. The suspect has also been tied to the slaying of his stepsister.\n\nManshaus is believed to have been inspired by attacks this year in New Zealand and the U.S. \u2014 a mass shooter killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15 while a gunman left at least 22 dead in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3.\n\nThe agency said \u201cmeeting places for Muslims and non-Western immigrants,\u201d political parties or persons, Jews and LGBT communities are \u201csymbolic targets.\u201d\n\nThe service updated its assessment hours after it said a Norwegian citizen in his 20s had been arrested for \u201cterrorist association\u201d Thursday afternoon. It was not known whether that case was linked to the heightened assessment.\n\nAfter last month\u2019s failed attack, PST said it had received a \u201cvague\u201d tip a year ago about Manshaus but it wasn\u2019t able to act because there was nothing concrete revealed. Its boss Hans Sverre Sjoevold then said there was no reason to change the overall threat assessment for Norway.", "description": "The heightened assessment comes after Norwegian right-wing extremists expressed support for perpetrators of other attacks around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d73ac53240000192377c644.jpeg?cache=1bflzgscta&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
