Prosecutors charged them, as well as two other men, with conspiracy, false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and falsifying records. An indictment charges that the men engaged in a straw-donor scheme to illegally donate money to a congressman\u2014former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican\u2014at the behest of a Ukrainian official, to get help in trying to have the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine fired. (Sessions wrote a letter calling for the diplomat\u2019s firing, and she was eventually removed.) In another scheme, they funneled money from a Russian foreign national, again in violation of the law, into donations, using a legal recreational-marijuana enterprise as a front.\n\n\u201cProtecting the integrity of elections, and protecting our elections from unlawful foreign influence, are core functions of our campaign-finance laws,\u201d Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a press conference on Thursday.\n\nThis is not the first time attention has turned to Parnas and Fruman. The men were already reported to have been assisting Giuliani in his quest to dig up dirt on dealings in Ukraine by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. (No evidence of wrongdoing has yet turned up.) BuzzFeed reported on the men\u2019s lavish spending during that investigation. Parnas told BuzzFeed he\u2019d met with the president \u201cmany times\u201d but wouldn\u2019t say what they discussed. The men seem to have been small-time businessmen with little political experience until recently, and how they got involved or what they were seeking is still not clear.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s game of chicken\n\nThe fact that Trump\u2019s corruption-seekers were, themselves, allegedly corrupt begs a comparison to Richard Nixon\u2019s crew of Plumbers, who were convened to investigate leaks of classified information but were eventually arrested for crimes of their own. The White House has argued that the Democratic impeachment inquiry is illegitimate because Trump did nothing wrong and there\u2019s nothing to investigate, but each new piece of information\u2014much less federal indictments\u2014makes that argument harder to sustain.\n\nEven before the arrests, there was evidence that the public wasn\u2019t buying it. A Fox News poll released Wednesday found that an eye-popping 51 percent of Americans want Trump impeached and removed from office. Another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed. The poll shows growing support in practically every group, across ideological and demographic categories. Some are especially worrisome for Trump: Suburban women favor impeachment and removal, 57 to 33. More than half of the respondents think the Trump administration is more corrupt than previous presidencies. Among those who oppose impeachment, only one in five say Trump did nothing wrong.", "description": "A pair of men helping the president\u2019s supposed anti-corruption campaign were apprehended as they tried to leave the United States.", "authors": ["David A.
