Bercow has been in the powerful post since 2009, and had earned the enmity of many Conservative Party kingpins who, in a break with normal practice, were planning to challenge him at the next election, which is expected shortly.\n\nBercow\u2019s emotional announcement drew sustained applause from the House and heartfelt thanks from friends and foes alike. He shed a few tears and choked up several times as he explained it was time for him to step down, in part because of family obligations.\n\n\u201cThroughout my time as speaker I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature for which I will make absolutely no apology to anyone, anywhere, at any time,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also seemed to warn about weakening Parliament\u2019s role at a time when the institution is in conflict with the prime minister.\n\n\u201cWe degrade this parliament at our peril,\u201d he said. \u201cI have served as a member of Parliament for 22 years, and for the last 10 as speaker. This has been, let me put it explicitly, the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life for which I will be eternally grateful.\n\nIt was a rare instance in which opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Conservative Cabinet minister Michael Gove agreed, both praising Bercow for his commitment to the democratic process.\n\n\u201cOur democracy is the stronger for your being the speaker. And whatever you do when you finally step down from Parliament, you do so with the thanks of a very large number of people,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nGove said: \u201cYour commitment to your principles and to your constituents is unwavering and an example to others.\u201d\n\nBercow, 56, began his career as a right-of-center conservative, but gradually morphed into someone perceived as an enemy by the Conservative Party power structure, largely because he was seen as a stout defender of Parliament\u2019s rights.\n\nThe speaker is supposed to be strictly impartial in the British system, and Bercow resigned from the Conservative Party as expected when he was elected to the post by secret ballot, but he has been outspoken in his criticism of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament, which is due to take effect later Monday.\n\nHe called it a \u201cconstitutional outrage.\u201d Some said that was a partisan statement, but many longtime Bercow watchers believed it was simply an assertion of his view that Parliament is sovereign and must be respected, not silenced.\n\nBercow\u2019s decision to speak out is consistent with the way he sees his role - protecting the primacy of Parliament from encroachment, either by an overzealous prime minister, an intrusive British judge, or by the European Union.\n\nHis last possible day in office is the day when Britain is scheduled to leave the 28-nation EU bloc. Bercow hasn\u2019t taken a public stance on Brexit, but lawmakers looking to leave the EU as quickly as possible tend to view him as an obstacle.\n\nBercow has played a pivotal role in the seemingly endless debates over Brexit. Bercow determines which amendments will be voted on and who will be called upon to speak, and uses his position to silence rabble rousers and rule on questions of parliamentary procedure.\n\nHe has a long tradition to protect - the speaker\u2019s role can be traced back to at least 1377.\n\nThere is no question that many of Johnson\u2019s allies see Bercow as a foe in the Brexit battle, a perception enhanced perhaps by the fact that his wife\u2019s car has an anti-Brexit bumper sticker. He has been called \u201cSpeaker of the Devil\u201d in a front-page headline for challenging the government\u2019s position.\n\nDespite the frequent grumbling about his outspoken nature, Bercow has been re-elected to the position twice.\n\nDuring general elections, speakers generally run unopposed by the major political parties and refrain from taking political stands. They are designated only as \u201cspeaker seeking re-election\u201d rather than as representatives of a specific party.\n\nBut annoyed Conservative Party leaders had indicated over the weekend they planned to sunder this tradition and challenge Bercow in his home district in an effort to force him out of Parliament.\n\nBercow will be giving up more than the spotlight. The position of speaker comes with handsome benefits, including housing and a spacious office in the Parliament complex.\n\nBercow has clashed with prior governments as well. He infuriated former Prime Minister Theresa May by making her efforts to bring her defeated Brexit bill back to Parliament more difficult when he ruled she couldn\u2019t bring the same bill back for a repeat vote.\n\nHe has also faced charges of bullying, but has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBercow is an aficionado of American politics and there is speculation he will make a lucrative speaking tour to the U.S. once he leaves office.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A colorful era in British parliamentary history is coming to a close with Speaker of the House John Bercow's abrupt announcement Monday that he will leave his influential post by the end of October.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gregory Katz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/britain_john_bercow_30588_c0-0-5184-3022_s1770x1032.jpg?f8af44803671c941549f723d1fe30bad83d555a9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
