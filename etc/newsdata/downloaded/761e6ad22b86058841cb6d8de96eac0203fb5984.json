Hardly much of a premium relative to PCI even though it's more of a pure play and has cheaper ER. My guess is people paying attention to dividend coverage ratios. Personally I don't see any fundamental logic to penalizing a fund for poor dividend coverage or even for dividend cuts, except to the extent of anticipating other investor's reactions. With PCI increasing it's dividend recently, I think odds are against a cut for other pimco comparables, so I'm sticking with PCM for now.", "description": "I think it's interesting that PCM has sailed through pimco's recent poor NAV performance, but its discount has been relatively pummelled.
