What he\u2019s doing about treating young men \u2014 teenagers who will mature in a few years \u2014 to make them stand out more in a financial fashion than their peers \u2013 the parents who can get involved and the hangers-on who can get involved. I know there are some guys who agree with that. To me, it\u2019s getting greedy.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law this week a provision that will allow college athletes to financially benefit from their likeness, including the ability to sign endorsement deals. The law directly contradicts the NCAA\u2019s policy on student-athletes getting paid. While it doesn\u2019t mandate that colleges pay their athletes, the legislation does allow for other ways for scholarship athletes to turn their brand into money. These avenues have been closed to NCAA athletes.\n\nThe NCAA doesn\u2019t allow athletes to receive compensation outside their scholarships. Namath, considered one of the greatest college quarterbacks of all-time, led Alabama to a national title in 1964 and didn\u2019t benefit from his likeness until he was drafted by the New York Jets. He's now a trendsetter in sports marketing who had some of the biggest endorsement deals of his generation and whose autobiography \"All the Way: My Life in Four Quarters\" just won an Emmy in the audiobook category, thinks the law is a slippery slope.\n\nEducation, Namath said, should be the purpose of college athletics and not a profit.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s law, which doesn\u2019t go in effect until 2023, has drawn criticism as it would upend decades of the NCAA\u2019s traditions and regulations and could be an unfair advantage for California. Other states could potentially follow suit and also legislate opportunities for student-athletes to monetize their brand.\n\nOne area of concern for Namath from the recent legislation in California goes beyond just the ethical and moral issues at play on both sides of the debate. A locker room can be a delicate place and Namath is concerned about introducing money into the equation, especially at such a young age.\n\nOnly a handful of star players will likely benefit from the law as they will be the ones most marketable for sponsorships. The rest of the athletes would be on the outside looking in.\n\n\u201cIt will be very difficult to keep the right values among the athletes in the locker room,\u201d Namath said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Joe Namath weighs in on the California legislation that will allow college athletes to get paid.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/RT-Joe-Namath.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
