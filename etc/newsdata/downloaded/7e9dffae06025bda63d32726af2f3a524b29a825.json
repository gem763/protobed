Whether the suspect planned the killing or it was just impulsive could bring a totally different result in jail terms. I am worried that the trial would be unfair,\u201d Leung said.\n\nTaiwan had reversed its earlier stance of not accepting Chan from Hong Kong on Tuesday, but stipulated he should be escorted back to the self-ruled island by Taiwanese police and prosecutors, who would be sent to the city to pick him up.\n\nTaiwan has been changing its way of speaking every day. Let us give them some time to clear things up first\n\nLawmaker Priscilla Leung\n\nThe Hong Kong government slammed the offer as \u201cdisrespect\u201d for the city\u2019s jurisdictional power and \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d.\n\nLeung, however, said it could be feasible for Taiwan police to \u201cjust stay on the Taiwan plane inside a Hong Kong restricted area and wait for Chan to get on board on his own\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of options worldwide. A suspect can be surrendered as long as it is voluntary. But it has to be based on mutual respect,\u201d she said. \u201cTaiwan has been changing its way of speaking every day. Let us give them some time to clear things up first.\u201d\n\nLegal academic Eric Cheung Tat-ming, of the University of Hong Kong, said there was nothing wrong with Taiwan having political considerations. But, he added, it would be totally unacceptable for its authorities to enforce law in Hong Kong.\n\nPriscilla Leung accused the Taiwanese authorities of prejudice in the Chan Tong-kai case.

Cheng said Hong Kong simply followed a legal principle restricting its courts to dealing with offences which took place within its territory.\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nThis article Hong Kong murder suspect Chan Tong-kai\u2019s transfer to Taiwan should be delayed until after island\u2019s presidential election, lawmaker says first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "A pro-establishment barrister and lawmaker has proposed postponing the voluntary surrender of a Hong Kong murder suspect to Taiwan by three months until after the island\u2019s presidential election, as the two sides wrangle over the case which sparked the city\u2019s current political crisis.Priscilla Leung Mei-fun", "authors": ["Lilian Cheng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/snA15Z8dDURaOywRczWuEQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/3fded819d730bfbda7f26c9c229b6264", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
