REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nLibya\u2019s conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers, which have been backing various armed groups since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. The former rebels have been fighting each other since then.\n\n\u201cWe also need to work on unifying all national institutions in order to save our dear neighbour from the ensuing chaos by militias and prevent the intervention of external actors in Libya\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Sisi said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nEgypt, along with the United Arab Emirates, is a supporter of Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libya National Army (LNA) has been trying to take Tripoli from forces allied with the internationally recognized government (GNA). Turkey backs the GNA.\n\nHaftar\u2019s forces started their campaign in April with a ground offensive supported by air strikes and his backers have repeatedly labeled militias in Tripoli as terrorist groups.\n\nThe campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people in Tripoli alone, killed hundreds of civilians, and risks disrupting oil supplies from the country.\n\n\u201cThis conflict needs to be stopped. It is time to take a bold and decisive stand to address the root causes of the Libyan crisis comprehensively and can be achieved by fully committing to the United Nations plan,\u201d Sisi said.\n\nU.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame last month unveiled plans for an international conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground, without naming a venue.\n\nGermany has emerged as a possible location with Berlin trying to put it together by October. Salame believes it can mediate as Germany is seen as impartial in the conflict in contrast to France and Italy, which have been competing for influence. France and Italy have oil and gas interests in Libya and have been accused of also backing protagonists in the conflict.\n\nBoth countries brought Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, along with regional players, together at summits in Paris and Palermo last year, but failed to achieve a breakthrough.\n\nThe two countries will host a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, which they say aims to move towards the U.N.-backed conference.\n\n\u201cThere will no military solution in Libya. Those who believe it are wrong and risk dragging the country into a dramatic turn,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters.", "description": "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Tuesday that a concerted effort was needed to stop militias taking control of Libya and to prevent external actors from intervening there.", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433667030&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0FL-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
