Ms. Paglia, 72, remembers the incident with a clarity that suggests a lifetime of unresolved umbrage.\n\n\u201cWe were released from school for religious instruction on Thursday afternoons,\u201d and teen Camille posed a question: \u201cIf God is infinitely forgiving, I asked the nun, is it possible that at some point in the future he\u2019ll forgive Satan?\u201d The nun\u2014a doctrinaire Irish Catholic without any of the \u201cpagan residue\u201d of Ms. Paglia\u2019s Italian culture\u2014\u201cturned beet red. She was so enraged that she condemned me in front of everybody for even asking that question.\u201d\n\nThat was the day Ms. Paglia left the Catholic Church. It was not the last time she asked an awkward, even incendiary, question. Such provocations are the stock-in-trade of this most free-spirited of America\u2019s public intellectuals.\n\nMs. Paglia is a professor of humanities and media studies at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, where she has been a tenured\u2014and occasionally embattled\u2014faculty member since 1984. This April, mutinous students demanded her firing over public comments she\u2019d made that were not wholly sympathetic to the #MeToo movement, as well as for an interview with the Weekly Standard that they called \u201ctransphobic.\u201d That denunciation, with its indignant dogmatism, is particularly slapstick, since Ms. Paglia describes herself as \u201ctransgender.\u201d\n\nThe protests were unsuccessful, largely thanks to a robust defense of Ms. Paglia by the university\u2019s president, David Yager. \u201cArtists over the centuries,\u201d he wrote in an open letter to students, \u201chave suffered censorship, and even persecution, for the expression of their beliefs through their work. My answer is simple: Not now, not at UArts.\u201d\n\nOver lunch at a Greek restaurant, Ms. Paglia tells me she belongs to the \u201cpro-sex, free-speech wing of feminism,\u201d which she says had its heyday in the 1990s. That was the decade in which she herself emerged from academic obscurity. In 1990 she published her first book, \u201cSexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson, \u201d an erudite yet pugnacious account of the competing roles of male and female in Western civilization. It was rejected\u2014she never tires of saying\u2014by seven publishers and five agents before Yale University Press picked it up.\n\nThe book vaulted Ms. Paglia into the American imagination as a bluestocking gone deliciously rogue. The same year, she published an op-ed article lauding the pop singer Madonna as \u201cthe true feminist,\u201d who \u201cexposes the puritanism and suffocating ideology of American feminism, which is stuck in an adolescent whining mode.\u201d The op-ed incensed the \u201cprudish\u201d feminist establishment. Ms. Paglia has since soured on Madonna, who she says was \u201conce refreshingly sane in her teasing affection for men\u201d but has now undergone a \u201ccollapse into rote male-bashing.\u201d\n\nMs. Paglia laments that the \u201cantisex and repressively doctrinaire side of feminism is back again\u2014big!\u201d She calls it \u201cvictim feminism\u201d and complains that \u201ceverything we\u2019d won in the 1990s has been totally swept away. Now we have this endless privileging of victimhood, with a pathological vulnerability seen as the default human mode.\u201d Everyone is made to cater to it\u2014\u201cin the workplace, in universities, in the demand for safe spaces.\u201d\n\nAs a teacher of undergraduates, Ms. Paglia despairs at how \u201cbad it is for young people, filled with fears, to be raised in this kind of a climate where personal responsibility isn\u2019t spoken of.\u201d Since her own youth, she says, college students have devolved from rebels into skittish supplicants, petitioning people in authority to protect them from real life. Young adults are encouraged to look for \u201csubstitute parent figures on campus, which is what my generation rebelled against in college. We threw that whole \u2018in loco parentis\u2019 thing out.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an undeniable irony in hearing a septuagenarian, from a generation that was famously preoccupied with youth, deplore the state of today\u2019s young people. \u201cOur parents were the World War II generation,\u201d Ms. Paglia says, \u201cso they had a sense of reality about life.\u201d Children now \u201care raised in a far more affluent period. Even people without much money have cellphones, televisions, access to cars. They\u2019re raised in an air-conditioned environment. I can still remember when there was no air-conditioning.\u201d She shudders as she sips her cold beer, adding that she suffered horribly in the heat.\n\n\u201cEverything is so easy now,\u201d Ms. Paglia continues. \u201cThe stores are so plentifully supplied. You just go in and buy fruits and vegetables from all over the world.\u201d Undergrads, who\u2019ve studied neither economics nor history, \u201chave a sense that this is the way life has always been. Because they\u2019ve never been exposed to history, they have no idea that these are recent attainments that come from a very specific economic system.\u201d\n\nCapitalism, she continues, has \u201cproduced this cornucopia around us. But the young seem to believe in having the government run everything, and that the private companies that are doing things for profit around them, and supplying them with goods, will somehow exist forever.\u201d\n\nMs. Paglia asks me to note that it was \u201cbecause of capitalism\u201d that her forebears \u201cescaped the crushing poverty of rural Italy,\u201d emigrating to Endicott, N.Y., to \u201cwork in the Endicott-Johnson shoe factories, whose vast buildings, tanning pools and smokestacks dominated my childhood.\u201d\n\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t use the phrase herself, you can call Ms. Paglia a feminist capitalist. \u201cWhile I believe that boom-and-bust capitalism is inherently Darwinian and requires moderate regulation for the long-term greater good,\u201d she says, \u201cI insist that capitalism has produced the glorious emancipation of women.\u201d They can now \u201csupport themselves and live on their own, and no longer must humiliatingly depend on father or husband.\u201d\n\nSo why do young women feel victimized? Ms. Paglia cites the near-extinction of \u201cbody language\u201d among the young and its impact on sexual relations on campus. The \u201closs of body language\u201d starts in middle and high school, \u201cwhere there\u2019s total absorption in social media and projected images on Instagram, and so on. So they don\u2019t know how to read each other, physically.\u201d When they get to college, this social deficiency is exacerbated by the effects of \u201cthat stupid law, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, that was passed in 1984.\u201d It effected a nationwide ban on alcohol sales to adults under 21.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to college,\u201d Ms. Paglia says, \u201cyou could go out for a beer, you could talk with a drink in a public place, in an adult environment.\u201d That\u2019s how 18-year-olds away from home for the first time learned the \u201cart of conversation, of looking at each other, reading facial expressions and body language.\u201d After the ban on drinking, \u201cinstead of a nice group of people conversing and flirting, you got the keg parties at fraternities on campus, this horrible environment where women milled about with men in this huge amount of noise, with people chugging beers down.\u201d\n\nMs. Paglia is distinctly animated now and\u2014body language!\u2014claps her hands for emphasis. \u201cSo almost immediately, by the late 1980s, you get this date-rape extravaganza, and the hysteria, and the victimage.\u201d Ms. Paglia has urged a repeal of the drinking-age law but \u201ccannot get any traction on this. No one will listen to me.\u201d\n\nBy contrast to her flaming public persona, Ms. Paglia is positively conventional in the classroom. \u201cAs I constantly stress,\u201d she says, \u201cmy base identity is as a hard-working, no-nonsense schoolmarm\u2014like the teaching nuns of global Roman Catholicism.\u201d Despite her avowed atheism, she confesses to keeping a Mass card of St. Teresa of \u00c1vila in her den at home.\n\nThis fall semester, she will teach two classes, \u201cArt of Song Lyric\u201d and \u201cStyle in Art.\u201d She asks me to \u201cstress that I do not teach \u2018my\u2019 ideas in the classroom.\u201d Instead, she teaches \u201cbroad-ranging\u201d courses and considers herself responsible for her students\u2019 \u201cgeneral education\u2014in which there are huge and lamentable gaps, thanks to the tragic decline of public education in this country.\u201d\n\nShe recalls a \u201chorrifying\u201d example from her classroom a few years ago. She was teaching \u201cGo Down, Moses, \u201d the famous Negro spiritual. \u201cThe whole thing is about antiquity,\u201d she says, \u201cbut obviously it has contemporary political references.\u201d She passed out the lyrics and played the music, \u201cand it suddenly hit me with horror\u2014none of them recognized the name \u2018Moses.\u2019 And I thought: Oh my God, when Moses is erased from the West, what is left of Western civilization?\u201d\n\nJudging by last semester\u2019s protests against Ms. Paglia, today\u2019s college students seem better versed in the polemics of gender identity than in Judeo-Christian history. This prompts me to ask Ms. Paglia, perhaps intrusively, why she regards herself as transgender. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt whatever,\u201d she responds, \u201cthat I have had a radical gender dysphoria since earliest childhood. Never once in my life have I felt female.\u201d Nor did she feel male, \u201cexcept when wearing my fabulous Halloween costumes as a Roman soldier, toreador or Napoleon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis strange alienation from standard human life certainly helped sharpen my powers of social observation,\u201d she says, \u201cand eventually made me a writer.\u201d Her many years of researching and writing \u201cSexual Personae,\u201d she adds, \u201cexorcised a lot of my accumulated hostility toward the gender system.\u201d\n\nThese days, she says, \u201cthere is only one occasion when my old turbulence returns\u2014when shopping for clothing.\u201d When she was in college, styles were \u201cgender-bending,\u201d and she wore \u201c Tom Jones shirts, flared pinstriped trousers, Navy pea coats and Beatles boots with Cuban heels.\u201d No more. Now she makes an annual \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to the sprawling King of Prussia shopping mall outside Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI cannot express too strongly my overwhelming sense of existential alienation and horror when confronted with those lavishly stocked stores,\u201d she says. There is nothing she can identify with in the women\u2019s department, or the men\u2019s. \u201cIt is completely inconsequential that I have attained a certain status as professor and author of eight books. At King of Prussia, my identity is completely wiped out\u2014erased!\u201d\n\nMr. Varadarajan is executive editor at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.", "description": "The students who demand her firing, Camille Paglia argues, take prosperity for granted, are socially undeveloped, and know little about Western history.
