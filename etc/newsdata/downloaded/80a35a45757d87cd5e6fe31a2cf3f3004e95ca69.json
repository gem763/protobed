It\u2019s essentially another way of expressing an amount of Bitcoin without making it unnecessarily confusing\n\nA Satoshi represents one hundred millionths of a Bitcoin. By being able to break up Bitcoin transactions into smaller denominations, they become easier to read and understand.\n\nSo, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to 1,000 millibitcoins (mBTC), 1,000,000 microbitcoins (\u03bcBTC), or 100,000,000 Satoshis.\n\nNow, while the exact figure is unknown, estimates suggest that Satoshi Nakamoto may own 1 million BTC, which given what we\u2019ve just explained, would be equivalent to 100,000,000,000,000 Satoshis.\n\nWhy are they useful?\n\nSimilarly to pence or cents, Satoshis come in handy when you want to send a relatively small amount of Bitcoin to someone.\n\nImagine you want to send someone 1,000 Sats \u2013 that\u2019s a lot easier to understand compared to 0.0000001 Bitcoin.\n\nBeing able to count the Sats makes Bitcoin less intimidating, making users feel like they actually own something.\n\nFinding a symbol\n\nBitcoin\u2019s currency symbol or glyph (\u0e3f) has been around for some time. In fact, it was first used by Nakamoto in an early release of the Bitcoin client \u2014 Apple even added it to the iOS12 keyboard last year.\n\nBut, while \u2018\u0e3f\u2019 has become widely accepted among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the community is yet to find a symbol for the Satoshi.\n\nThe discussion has been going on for a considerable amount of time but no consensus has been reached.\n\nAnd while there\u2019s still time, Satoshis are likely to become increasingly relevant if Bitcoin\u2019s price rises.\n\nIf people start to use Bitcoin to purchase mundane everyday items such as milk, bread, or even a cup of coffee, it\u2019ll be necessary to have something in place which makes the technology easier to understand and communicate.\n\nBut if we\u2019ve learned anything about this industry, it\u2019s that it will take time.", "description": "Here's a quick overview of the Satoshi, to help you understand what it is, how it works, and why it's important for Bitcoin.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fsatoshi-bitcoin-cryptocurrency.jpg&signature=7c1d472fc9de57d732e66f1e0ecca273", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
