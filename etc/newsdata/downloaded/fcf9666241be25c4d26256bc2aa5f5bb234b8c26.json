Maybe because, unlike parenting philosophy or political views, religious tenets can\u2019t change over time. Religious law is rigid, so civil law must bend.\n\nFor most people, though, religion is flexible. Believers routinely ignore inconvenient or outdated passages in their holy books, choosing, for instance, to fixate on Leviticus 18:22 (\u201cYou shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\u201d) but ignore Leviticus 19:19 (\u201cDo not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material\u201d). And then there are disputes among believers. Can Jews eat rice during Passover? Yes and no. Does baptism require full immersion? Yes and no.\n\nEverybody picks among religious laws \u2014 even religions do. Just last year, the U.S. Episcopal Diocese voted to stop using masculine pronouns for God. In 2015, Pope Francis declared that, for one year only, abortion was a slightly more forgivable sin.\n\nBut if religious beliefs are not mandatory or immutable, then how are they different from secular beliefs?", "description": "", "authors": ["Kate Cohen", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Whats-So-Special-About-Religious-Belief"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
