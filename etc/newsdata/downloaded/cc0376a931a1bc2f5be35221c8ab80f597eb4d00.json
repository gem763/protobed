The new administration will be overseen by the proposed commissioner for internal market, Sylvie Goulard.\n\nVon der Leyen also said the directorate general would be responsible for implementing the EU\u2019s future Space Program, covering the bloc\u2019s global and regional satellite navigation systems Galileo and EGNOS and the Earth observation satellite constellation Copernicus.\n\nThe creation of the directorate general comes at a time of increased interest in space defense capabilities, with the U.S., India and China developing space weapons to attack and defend satellites.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, ESA Director General Jan W\u00f6rner criticized the plans, saying the Commission should resist the temptation to militarize space.\n\nIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, the British space industry will be unable to bid for contracts from the Commission to build Galileo satellites.\n\n\u201cI personally hope there are no star wars. That should not be our goal,\u201d he said, adding that the space agency was created for \u201cexclusively peaceful purposes\u201d and it will stay as such for as long as he is at the helm.\n\n\u201cTo keep space peaceful is for me a very important message,\u201d he added.\n\nAt a roundtable session on Tuesday, W\u00f6rner advised against fostering a defense race in space. \u201cWhat I am concerned about is that you can see some nationalism also in space, looking to use space also as a new place of defense and war and all of this.\u201d\n\nHe was interrupted by a round of applause from the audience.\n\nA spokesperson for von der Leyen said: \"We don't comment on public speculation.\"\n\nAt previous ministerial conferences, ESA member states prioritized programs that yield quick, high returns to their national industries, such as navigation and Earth observation satellite systems.\n\nW\u00f6rner took the reins at ESA in 2015 with a four-year term. But in 2018 the agency\u2019s 22 member states extended his term for two additional years.\n\nThe extension means he will oversee ESA\u2019s ministerial meeting in Seville in late November, where ministers will set Europe\u2019s space agenda by committing \u20ac10.3 billion in public money to new and existing programs.\n\nW\u00f6rner said he would not campaign for a second extension to his term and will step down unless ESA member states agree he should stay. He pointed to differences of opinion regarding who should steer the agency in the coming years.\n\n\u201cI will not proactively ask for that. Last time I had to campaign for myself and it was a very ugly situation. I was treated in a very ugly manner by some people. At the time I said I would never do this again. I\u2019m old enough, I\u2019m 65. Maybe a young woman would be a much better director general than me.\u201d\n\nBut what about if ministers agree he should stay? \u201cThat\u2019s a totally different story,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I will not run around asking: \u2018Are you supporting me?\u2019 If member states come and say, \u2018We want you to continue,\u2019 I might consider it, but I won\u2019t proactively ask for it.\u201d\n\nBrexit woes\n\nFor the last three years, W\u00f6rner has publicly lamented the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the EU, while insisting that Brexit will not change Britain\u2019s position in ESA.\n\nAlthough the agency is independent of the EU, it carries out a large amount of work for the European Commission, especially through the Galileo and Copernicus programs.\n\nIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, the British space industry will be unable to bid for contracts from the Commission to build Galileo satellites, and could potentially be excluded from the EU's GovSatCom program too.\n\nThe latter aims to provide a middle tier of communication services between commercial and military satellites and is being developed by ESA and the European Defence Agency\u2019s 15 member states \u2014 including Britain \u2014 plus Norway.\n\nIn the interview, held during the UK Space annual conference taking place in Newport earlier this week, W\u00f6rner said he still hopes the U.K. and the EU will reach an agreement that allows British industry to participate in EU space programs.\n\n\u201cThere are examples, like Israel, Switzerland, Norway. One cannot say this is not possible,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the divorce has to take place first, with all the dirty things like in life, and the day after one can start from scratch.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, U.K. Science Minister Chris Skidmore said he would be making \u201cstrong personal representations that as a nation we will need to increase our ESA contribution to strengthen our collaborations\u201d at the coming ministerial conference.\n\nW\u00f6rner said this could benefit the U.K., especially if the country emerges as the largest contributor in one or several ESA programs, since that would grant Britain some special rights over their development. But W\u00f6rner warned the U.K. against thinking it can buy influence over the agency\u2019s future plans. \u201cIn ESA, the rule is one country, one vote,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director general wants member countries to contribute more to the emerging field of space safety and security \u2014 for example, programs aimed at removing space debris, deflecting asteroids and putting in place a pre-warning system for severe space weather events. Of ESA\u2019s four pillars, this is the one that receives the smallest fraction (7 percent) of the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nAt previous ministerial conferences, however, ESA member states prioritized programs that yield quick, high returns to their national industries, such as navigation and Earth observation satellite systems. In contrast, the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM), which sought to evaluate the technical possibilities of changing the flight path of a small asteroid, failed to get the financial support it needed at the last ESA ministerial conference, in 2016.\n\n\u201cAIM was not realized and therefore I\u2019m nervous,\u201d W\u00f6rner said. \u201cFor me this part of space safety has a special value. [The question is] whether I can convince member states not just to play for competitiveness of their own industries and for inspiration, but also for responsibility.\u201d\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
