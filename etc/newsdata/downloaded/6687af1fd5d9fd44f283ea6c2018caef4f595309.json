The first loss will sting.\n\nBridgewater threw a 29-yard touchdown to Alvin Kamara late in the first half on a screen pass where he bounced off several tacklers on his way to the end zone. He added a 1-yard TD toss to Michael Thomas on fourth-and-goal on the first possession of the second half, a drive kept alive by an illegal formation penalty against Seattle on a missed field goal attempt.\n\nBut the key for New Orleans was a pair of first-half touchdowns with Bridgewater standing on the sideline.\n\nDeonte Harris took a punt back 53 yards for a score in the first quarter, and Vonn Bell picked up Chris Carson\u2019s third lost fumble in three games, and returned it 33 yards for a TD in the second quarter.\n\nThe two non-offensive touchdowns for New Orleans, plus Seattle\u2019s numerous miscues took pressure off Bridgewater. He didn\u2019t need to win the game. He simply needed to avoid his own errors, which he did. He got the ball in the hands of his playmakers, Kamara mostly, and didn\u2019t take unnecessary risks. Bridgewater completed 19 of 27 passes for 177 yards.\n\nKamara had nine catches for 92 yards and added another 69 yards rushing.\n\nMeanwhile, Seattle gave gifts to the Saints all day, whether it was turnovers, untimely penalties, terrible tackling or costly clock management. It was an equation of errors by Seattle that was too much to overcome.\n\nRussell Wilson threw an 8-yard TD to Tyler Lockett in the first half and ran for a pair of touchdowns in the fourth quarter. His 2-yard TD run early in the fourth pulled Seattle within 27-14. New Orleans went three-and-out on its next drive but Seattle couldn\u2019t convert on fourth-and-1 deep in its own end and Kamara scored on a 1-yard plunge for the capper. Wilson also missed Lockett on a fourth-down throw in the end zone in the third quarter.\n\nWilson was 32 of 50 for 406 yards and added a 4-yard TD to Will Dissly on the final play of the game.\n\nNO PRESSURE\n\nBridgewater was helped by Seattle\u2019s pass rush being unable to create consistent pressure. The debut of Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah playing together on the defensive line yielded minimal results. Seattle had zero sacks, only two quarterback hits. While Bridgewater got rid of the ball quickly, he was comfortable in the pocket.\n\nEND OF HALF\n\nSeattle missed a chance to trim the deficit at the end of the first half because of poor clock management. Seattle took possession with 29 seconds left and two timeouts. The Seahawks chose not to use a timeout after a 9-yard completion to Dissly. Wilson took the next snap with 10 seconds left and after scrambling hit DK Metcalf for 54 yards to the Saints 16. Seattle attempted to call timeout, but officials said it came after the clock hit zero.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaints: New Orleans returns home after two weeks on the road and faces Dallas next Sunday.\n\nSeahawks: Seattle travels to NFC West rival Arizona next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Teddy Bridgewater threw two touchdown passes in his first start in place of Drew Brees, New Orleans also scored TDs on defense and special teams, and the Saints beat the Seattle Seahawks 33-27 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/saints_seahawks_football_03752_c0-175-4179-2611_s1770x1032.jpg?66e60c14294890775eade6ac366455b99819bc63", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
