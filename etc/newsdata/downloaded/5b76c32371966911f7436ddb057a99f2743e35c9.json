He was armed with a large knife and as he entered Exchange Court began lunging, attacking people with the knife.\n\n\u201cTwo unarmed police community support officers were in Exchange Court and attempted to confront the attacker. He then chased them with the knife as they were calling for urgent assistance.\n\n\u201cThe man attacked people around him and we understand five people were injured by him. Although the injuries are nasty, we are told that, thankfully, none are life-threatening.\u201d\n\nMr Jackson added: \u201cOther officers both armed and unarmed quickly responded and within five minutes he was challenged and detained by armed officers on Market Street outside the Arndale Centre.\n\n\u201cHe was initially arrested for serious assaults. He was taken to police custody and has now been arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It appears random, is certainly brutal and of course extremely frightening for anyone who witnessed it.\u201d\n\nMr Jackson said the incident was \u201cbound to bring back memories of the awful events of 2017\u201d.\n\nHe said the force had increased patrols in the area, but added: \u201cWe do not believe there is a wider threat at this time and we are hoping to return the city to normality by tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nMr Jackson called on anyone who may have been present to send any images or footage they have taken to the GMP website.\n\nA 19-year-old woman and another woman were both taken to hospital with stab injuries and their condition was described as stable by the force.\n\nA man in his 50s was also hospitalised with stab wounds, while a woman in her 40s was treated by paramedics at the scene but was not stabbed.\n\nBoris Johnson, the prime minister, said he was \u201cshocked by the incident and my thoughts are with the injured and all those affected\u201d.\n\nBev Hughes, Greater Manchester\u2019s deputy mayor for policing, crime and fire, said: \u201cI want to praise Greater Manchester\u2019s emergency services for their swift and professional action. Our thoughts are with the five people injured.\n\n\u201cThe scene has been secured and all emergency services are engaged in ensuring public safety \u2013 the investigation is ongoing.\u201d\n\nA multi-agency response has been launched following the incident, with emergency service chiefs holding a gold-level strategy meeting with local government officials.\n\nOfficers initially declared a response under Operation Pato, a plan devised to deal with a suspected marauding terror attack, however this was later downgraded, Mr Jackson said.\n\nWhile the nature of the incident remains unclear, the decision to involve counter-terror police comes two years after the Manchester Arena bombing, in which 23 were killed at an Ariana Grande concert.\n\nAnd in May a man was charged with three counts of attempted murder and one count of possessing a terrorist document after a stabbing at Manchester Victoria railway station on New Years Eve.\n\nThe current threat level for a terror attack in the UK stands at severe \u2013 the second highest rating that ranks an incident as \u201chighly likely\u201d.\n\nThe Arndale Centre itself was the site of a terror attack in 1996, when the IRA detonated a 1,500kg lorry bomb on the neighbouring Corporation Street, injuring 212 people but killing none.", "description": "A man has been arrested on suspicion\u00a0of terrorism after three people were stabbed\u00a0at Manchester\u2019s Arndale shopping centre on Friday.
