The company said it did it because of dangerous wind forecasts but acknowledged that its execution was poor.\n\nIts website frequently crashed, and many people said they did not know the power was going out.\n\nPG&E did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sanctions.\n\nIn addition to restoring power faster, the PUC said the utility must work harder to avoid such large-scale outages, develop better ways to communicate with the public and local officials, get a better system for distributing outage maps and work with emergency personnel to ensure PG&E staff are sufficiently trained.\n\nShe ordered the utility to perform an audit of its performance during the outage, which began last Wednesday.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has also criticized PG&E for its performance during the outage, blaming what he called decades of mismanagement, underinvestment and lousy communication with the public. On Monday the Democratic governor urged the utility to compensate affected customers with a bill credit or rebate worth $100 for residential customers or $250 for small businesses.\n\nNewsom said the shutoffs affected too many customers for too long, and it is clear PG&E implemented them \u201cwith astounding neglect and lack of preparation.\u201d", "description": "California\u2019s top utility regulator blasted Pacific Gas and Electric on Monday for what she called \u201cfailures in execution\u201d during the largest planned power...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT281_pge101_ZG_20191014184416.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
