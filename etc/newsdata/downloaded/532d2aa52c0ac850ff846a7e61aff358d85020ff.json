He asked employees to stop working.\n\n\u201cAs of tonight, we are not in a position to compensate you,\u201d he said. Employees would be paid for work performed last week, he added.\n\nNeighborly started in 2012 and raised money from investors like Ashton Kutcher at Sound Ventures, Maven Ventures and Stanford University, according to the company. It sought to sell bonds in smaller increments than the typical $5,000 lots to make it more affordable for residents to invest in their communities. Cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, used Neighborly to sell such deals.\n\nBut the company ended up having a limited impact on the state and local debt market. It was only credited as senior manager on 12 municipal-bond transactions, and most of those were under $20 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWilson said in July that the company was moving away from municipal bonds as a focus and cutting 25% of its workforce. The company has since moved onto fiber broadband networks, which the company says will benefit people with faster internet service.\n\nWhen reached by phone on Monday night, Wilson said the payroll stop was needed while the company restructures itself away from municipal bonds to focus on broadband. He said he doesn\u2019t think Neighborly will have to shut down, and he declined to comment when asked if the company would file for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn the memo, Wilson said investors are \u201cexcited\u201d about the opportunity to close the digital divide. \u201cWe are all aligned on what we need to do, but this still comes with another difficult period of reorganization,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Muni Startup Fires Executive in Ex-Morgan Stanley Banker\u2019s Suit\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Amanda Albright in New York at aalbright4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Elizabeth Campbell at ecampbell14@bloomberg.net, Michael B.
