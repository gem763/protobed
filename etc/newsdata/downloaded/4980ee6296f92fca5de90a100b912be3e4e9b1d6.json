He is set to make his decision by Wednesday.\n\nThe post-election consultations are usually a formality, but the largely ceremonial president is now playing a key role after an almost tied election result.\n\n\u201cThere is one thing that the people are largely united over and that is the desire that there won\u2019t be third elections,\u201d Rivlin said.\n\nThe smaller parties\u2019 recommendations were split between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White\u2019s Benny Gantz.\n\nThat would suggest that, coming out of the talks, Netanyahu holds a small edge over Gantz.\n\nRivlin will likely pick the candidate with the most recommendations who will then have 28 days to try to cobble together a government. If the first candidate chosen fails within that time, the second is given the opportunity. If he too doesn\u2019t manage, the country could head to a third, unprecedented election.\n\nIn Rivlin\u2019s first round of talks on Sunday, the Joint Arab List threw its support behind Gantz, the first time the Arab parties had recommended a candidate since 1992, saying it was doing so in a bid to topple Netanyahu, whose anti-Arab rhetoric has infuriated and offended Arabs in Israel during his decade in power. The backing promised to give Gantz a slight edge in support.\n\nBut on Monday, the Joint Arab List said it was withdrawing some of its members\u2019 recommendations for Gantz, trimming his support to below Netanyahu\u2019s.\n\nLast week\u2019s repeat election produced no clear winner, with Blue and White receiving 33 seats in Israel\u2019s 120-member parliament and Netanyahu\u2019s Likud garnering 31 seats. Both sides fell short of the majority needed to form a government and therefore must seek the support of other parties.\n\nNeither party can form a coalition without the eight seats won by firebrand former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who on Sunday declined to endorse either candidate for prime minister. Lieberman has pushed Gantz and Netanyahu to agree to sit with him in a broad, secular unity government, and both have agreed in theory but disagree over who should head it.\n\nThe vote last week was a never-before held second election which was triggered after Netanyahu was unable to forge a coalition and then dissolved parliament.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Israel's president wrapped up his second and final day of crucial talks to find a new prime minister and a way out of political deadlock, after meeting Monday with the smaller parties elected in last week's vote.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tia Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/israel_elections_08522_c0-449-5379-3585_s1770x1032.jpg?0855a679a3550d098837744d59eed373d61a206b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
