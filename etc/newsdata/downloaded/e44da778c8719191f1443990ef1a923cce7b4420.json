Since then however, allegations surrounding the party have continued to be made against me. I have therefore come to the conclusion that I should make this statement and step down, with immediate effect.\"\n\nA statement from Warner Music, Atlantic's parent company, said: \"Ben Cook is leaving Atlantic UK and this will be his last week in the office\".\n\nImage caption Cook has worked with artists including (clockwise from top left): Ed Sheeran, Stormzy, Anne-Marie, Mahalia, Clean Bandit and Rudimental\n\nCook had been at Atlantic for 12 years and was appointed president in 2014.\n\nHe started his career at Ministry of Sound, where he masterminded hits like Eric Prydz's multi-platinum chart-topper Call On Me and Benny Benassi's Satisfaction.\n\nAfter joining Atlantic subsidiary Asylum in 2007, he worked with Wiley, taking Wearing My Rolex to number two; and helped build careers for Rudimental, Charli XCX and Anne-Marie.\n\nAlong with Ed Howard, he signed Ed Sheeran to an album deal in January 2011, after noting how the star's No. 5 Collaborations Project EP had reached number two in the iTunes charts as an independent release.\n\nCook's seven-year tenure as president of Atlantic saw the label's share of the album UK market grow to 7.9%, thanks in no small part to Sheeran's success; although the label was also home to big-sellers by Bruno Mars, Clean Bandit and Migos.\n\n\"I am devastated that this mistake has caused upset and has called into question my commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, values which I have championed throughout my career,\" said Cook as he stepped down.\n\n\"I have learned a great deal from this event and will resolutely continue to champion these values moving forward.\"\n\nParlophone's co-president Mark Mitchell will take on the leadership of the label on an interim basis.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
