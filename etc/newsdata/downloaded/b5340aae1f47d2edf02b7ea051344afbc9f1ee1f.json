The founder of water company, WaterTALENT, pleaded guilty in May to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, officials said at the time.\n\nIn 2017, Sloane allegedly bought a swimming cap and water polo gear on Amazon and then photographed his oldest son in a pool making \u201cwater polo poses,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen during Tuesday\u2019s court appearance.\n\nSloane then had the images doctored and sent them to William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, whom he paid $250,000 to have his son fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California as an athlete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe crimes did not end at the infinity pool,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cHe lied to [the] high school, lied about his use of Singer, lied to USC when they asked questions about his donation to USC women's sports,\u201d Rosen continued. \u201cThen he bragged to Singer, who told him: \u2018You are slick.\u2019 \u201d\n\nProsecutors recommended a sentence of one year and one day behind bars, and a $75,000 fine. His attorneys requested three years of supervised release, 2,000 hours of community service and an unspecified fine.\n\nIn addition to his time behind bars, Sloane was ordered to pay a $95,000 fine and perform 500 hours of community service over the course of two years.\n\nOn Sept. 13, \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in jail, and ordered to pay a $30,000 fine, and serve 250 hours of community service and one year of probation.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty in May to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying $15,000 to have her daughter\u2019s SAT scores fixed in 2017.\n\nBut unlike Huffman, Rosen said Tuesday, Sloane paid 17 times more money, Rosen said.\n\n\"Huffman kept her kid out of crime. The defendant threw his son into the family pool...Huffman felt the twinge of remorse. This defendant wanted to meet Singer and chat about how to lie to the [Internal Revenue Service].\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen at Devin Sloane's Tuesday sentencing.\n\nSloane's defense attorney argued that his client's background of community service and overcoming adversity shows \"he's a good man who made a mistake.\"\n\n\"He did it with his eyes open. He fully accepts responsibility for his actions,\" he said. \"He made a mistake with a bad person who got caught.\"\n\nSloane choked up as he addressed the court before hearing his sentencing.\n\n\"I apologize to my son. My wife. My colleagues who have been so supportive...I've always dedicated myself to others. This will now be my mission for the rest of my life.\" Devin Sloane, as he addressed the court on Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAlso on Tuesday, officials announced an added money laundering charge against Xiaoning Sui, who was the 52nd person arrested in connection to the federal investigation. Sui was initially charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\nThe Associated Press and Fox News\u2019s Andrew Fone contributed to this story.", "description": "Devin Sloane was sentenced for four months behind bars, ordered to pay a $95,000 fine and perform 500 hours of community service.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP-College-Admissions-Bribery.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
