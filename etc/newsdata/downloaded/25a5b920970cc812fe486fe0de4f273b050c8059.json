The new concept, which Samsung didn\u2019t name, looks more like a traditional flip phone thanks to a foldable display that allows the device to fold in half.\n\n\u201cThis brand-new form factor that we\u2019re now exploring will not only easily fit in your pocket, but it also changes the way you use your phone,\u201d explained Hyesoon Jeong, head of Samsung\u2019s framework R&D group, onstage at Samsung\u2019s Developer Conference. The idea behind the concept is to take Samsung\u2019s foldable smartphone technology and push it to \u201cbecome more compact,\u201d and extend to new device form factors.\n\nSamsung didn\u2019t spend much time detailing the device, nor when the company plans to make this available. There was no mention of the hardware involved, and whether Samsung has improved its foldable display technology from last year.\n\nThe company did use this mysterious device as a bridge to discuss an upcoming update to its One UI efforts with Android. \u201cAs a pioneer in the foldable category, we understand that every innovative form factor requires an equally innovative user experience,\u201d explained Jeong.\n\nSamsung has been working on improving its Android user interface since it debuted the Galaxy Fold device earlier this year, and the company is now working on One UI 2. which looks like a more refined version of the changes the company introduced with the S10 and Note 10 this year.\n\nOne UI 2 includes more glanceable information, better reachability for one-handed use, and \u201cmore vibrant hues\u201d throughout the OS. Animated icons will be available too, and a full dark mode. Overall, it looks like minor but useful changes to the customization Samsung offers today with its Android handsets.\n\nSoftware aside, this new clamshell / flip phone foldable hardware looks like the future of devices like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold. While the Fold started off life with a lot of screen issues, it\u2019s clear Samsung isn\u2019t ready to give up on foldable display technology. Samsung didn\u2019t provide solid details today, but the company is teasing that the future of foldable phones might look like the popular Motorola Razr of the past.", "description": "Samsung has teased a new foldable phone concept.
