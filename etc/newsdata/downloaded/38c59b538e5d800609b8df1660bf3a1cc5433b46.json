But don\u2019t forget that your credit score is only one aspect of many; card issuers may also consider other factors, like your income and credit history, when evaluating your application.\n\nOne last thing to keep in mind is Chase\u2019s five-cards-in-24-months rule. You can read more about that policy here, but the gist is this: you shouldn\u2019t apply for this card (or any Chase-issued card) if you\u2019ve already opened five personal credit cards in the last 24 months. Attempting to do so will almost certainly result in a denial, and could even hurt your chances on future Chase applications.\n\nWhat points can you get with the Chase Sapphire Reserve card?\n\nChase has a proprietary points system called Ultimate Rewards Points. The Sapphire Preferred card earns you 2 Ultimate Rewards Points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining, and 1 Ultimate Reward Point for every dollar you spend on other purchases. Chase\u2019s broad definition of \u201cdining\u201d includes fast food and coffee shops, as well as restaurants, so you can earn Ultimate Rewards points pretty fast. Each point has a cash value of $0.01.\n\nThere are a number of ways to redeem Ultimate Rewards points, including as cash back, as statement credit, or by transferring them to partner airlines, which we\u2019ll get to later. But the most valuable way to redeem Ultimate Rewards points is via the Chase travel portal. It values your points 25% higher.\n\nMore: The best credit cards of 2019\n\nSay you have 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points (valued at $500) to put towards a hotel stay, but the suite you\u2019re considering costs $625 a night.

If you spend $4,000 with your Preferred in the first three months, you\u2019ll automatically get 60,000 points.

There\u2019s also no introductory APR period, unlike other credit cards with introductory 0% APR offers, so you\u2019ll be charged interest on any balance you carry, unless you pay it off in full every month.\n\nOther than that, there aren\u2019t many downsides to the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. It has more benefits than nearly every comparable card on the market, especially for its rather low annual fee.
