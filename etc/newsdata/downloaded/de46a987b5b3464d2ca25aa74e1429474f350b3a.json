I made my call and I wanted to show I was prepared to put myself on the line to achieve what I believe the team could do.\n\n\"I can honestly say I'm always looking to be better but I am really proud of what I have been able to do over the last four years with the team under some very challenging circumstances on and off the field.\"\n\nAustralia's World Cup exit was a bitter end for eight squad members who are either moving to overseas clubs next year or retiring, including centurions Will Genia and Sekope Kepu, along with flank David Pocock.\n\nCheika's tenure was marked by a successful 2015 World Cup campaign in which Australia reached the final, only to be beaten by the All Blacks. It earned him the world coach of the year accolade.\n\nBut the past 18 months have been less successful, with last year's miserable run followed by the disappointing World Cup in Japan.\n\nHis powers had been watered down at the end of last year, when Scott Johnson was recruited from Scotland to assume the new role of director of rugby - effectively his boss.\n\nAnd in a bombshell on his departure, Cheika revealed he barely had a relationship with the Rugby Australia hierarchy.\n\n\"It is no secret I have no relationship with the CEO (Raelene Castle) and not much with the chairman (Cameron Clyne),\" he was quoted as saying by Australia's Fox Sports.\n\nIn a statement, Castle thanked Cheika for his \"dedication and service\".\n\n\"Michael is a passionate and experienced coach who worked tirelessly to get the best out his players,\" she said, adding that Johnson would now lead a full review, with much work already completed in \"preparing for the future\".", "description": "Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has quit after their humiliating Rugby World Cup quarter-final exit against England.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7946/6c97529af18949da8acbb2e144db03eb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
