Further, records show Omar filed joint tax returns with a man she wasn't legally married to, but simply married \"within her faith.\" This is also against the law. From October 2018, when Omar was running for office:\n\nWin or lose, however, a Department of Justice investigation into her past appears inevitable. A remarkable -- and growing -- amount of evidence implicates her in multiple federal and state felonies. The allegations stem from Omar\u2019s 2009 marriage to British citizen Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, her apparent brother. Below, exclusive new evidence backs the claim that this marriage was fraudulent. Also, this new evidence suggests that student loan fraud and immigration fraud were Omar\u2019s motivations for marrying Mr. Elmi.\n\nEarlier this month, Omar officially filed for divorce from her second husband, citing an \"irretrievable breakdown.\" That move came after Omar was accused of having an affair with political consultant Tim Mynett. The accusation came in divorce papers filed by Mynett's wife.\n\n\"Dr. Beth Jordan Mynett says her cheating spouse, Tim Mynett, told her in April that he was having an affair with the Somali-born US representative and that he even made a 'shocking declaration of love' for the Minnesota congresswoman before he ditched his wife, alleges the filing, submitted in DC Superior Court on Tuesday,\" the New York Post reported.\n\nCampaign records show Omar paid Mynett's consulting firm thousands of dollars for personal travel reimbursement after her campaign ended, indicating her affair was being paid for with campaign funds. Again, not allowed.\n\nNow, according to Steinberg, the Department of Justice is taking Omar's slew of potential violations seriously.\n\nBIG Ilhan Omar update:\n\n\n\nI know you are disgusted by @IlhanMN\u2019s lawless behavior lately, and her anti-Semitic demand we only sanction Israel, not Turkey and Iran.\n\n\n\nSo here's some good news.\n\n\n\nSeveral weeks ago, I gave pivotal, never-published info on @IlhanMN to the FBI. (1/x) \u2014 David Steinberg (@realDSteinberg) October 30, 2019\n\nA formal complaint had been filed with DOJ -- and DOJ actually responded. DOJ arranged a meeting w/ an FBI SAC.\n\n\n\nI have been beyond pleasantly surprised by how receptive the FBI has been w/ me and others in this matter. (2/x) \u2014 David Steinberg (@realDSteinberg) October 30, 2019\n\nIf a federal investigation is opened based upon this meeting, I believe the never-published information I shared should quickly lead the FBI to conclusive evidence that @IlhanMN committed numerous felonies between 2009-2017.\n\n\n\n(3/x) \u2014 David Steinberg (@realDSteinberg) October 30, 2019\n\nI have had the information I shared w/ the FBI for about a year.\n\n\n\nDespite its value, I felt that publishing it would be an unacceptable violation of two of @IlhanMN\u2019s family members\u2019 privacy.\n\n\n\nBut I believe it is in the public\u2019s best interest for the FBI to have it.
