The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be launching a service to manage all refunds on Monday, 30 September, with details published in the coming days. It has asked people not to submit anything to the CAA before then.\n\nThe CAA said all refunds should be processed within two months of a claim form being submitted properly.\n\nThe majority of of Thomas Cook holidays are packages.\n\nDoes the refund cover everything?\n\nStating the obvious, everything that was paid for as part of the package - such as flights, accommodation, and excursions - will be refunded.\n\nSome holidaymakers might have paid separately for airport parking or car hire while away. In this situation, they would need to make a claim from their travel insurer for the cost.\n\nIn more extreme cases, such a wedding, there may be a host of other things that could be affected. Specialist cover, such as wedding insurance, may be the only route for those left out of pocket.\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nCould I switch to another holiday?\n\nNo, holidaymakers with package deals get a refund, as that is what the ATOL protection states.\n\nSome other operators which used Thomas Cook flights will try to switch their customers to an alternative at no extra cost.\n\nI have only booked a flight with Thomas Cook. What are my rights?\n\nThe ATOL protection covers packages, not flight-only deals. So that means you would not get an automatic refund.\n\nInstead, it is likely you would need to make a claim on travel insurance. That is why it is always advised to buy travel insurance at the same time as booking a holiday. Some policies have an exclusion for the collapse of an airline, so not everyone will be covered.\n\nA spokesman for the Association of British Insurers says: \"As a last resort, travel insurance with scheduled airline failure cover can cover the cost of a flight when the airline has gone into administration. A travel insurance policy with travel disruption cover will cover the cost of new travel arrangements.\"\n\nThe other alternative is claiming a refund from the provider of the credit or debit card you used, so-called section 75 rules.\n\nThere may be a little more protection if the hotel you booked was linked to the flight, such as a click-through when booking the flight.\n\nAnyone who bought a package that did not include a flight may be covered under the separate ABTA scheme.\n\nI'm on holiday now, what do I do?\n\nAt the moment, enjoy your break as much as you can - do not cut it short. That said, the repatriation operation will only run up to and including Sunday 6 October. After that, travellers would have to make their own plans, although those covered by ATOL will be refunded.\n\nHoteliers will be paid via the ATOL scheme, so they should not ask for any extra payment.\n\nUK package holiday customers will be brought home \"as close as possible\" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. They must take their original ticket information with them and will be issued with a fresh boarding card for their flight.\n\nCustomers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to be posted on a dedicated CAA website as soon as they are available, up to 72 hours before its scheduled departure.\n\nThe CAA said some people might be flown to different UK airports from the ones originally scheduled, but free transfers would be provided.\n\nThe DfT added that a \"small number\" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs.\n\nThomas Cook had 600,000 customers on holiday from around the world, including up to 160,000 from the UK, so it will be a huge logistical challenge.\n\nWhen the Monarch airline collapsed, there were arguments for a better repatriation system, but nothing has been implemented as yet.\n\nI've been given a Thomas Cook gift card. Will it be of use?\n\nNothing is clear on that yet. It is highly likely that gift cards or vouchers will be worthless, consumer experts say.\n\nImage copyright Thomas Cook\n\nIt will depend on what happens to the company, whether it is rekindled and whether any vouchers would then be honoured. If they are useless, then the person who bought it might be able to make a claim to their credit card provider if it was a generous gift of more than \u00a3100, or their debit card provider for less.\n\nThere is better news for those with a pre-paid Thomas Cook currency card, as any funds held on that are protected separately from the company, so will not be lost.\n\nWhat about other services, such as sport packages?\n\nThomas Cook ran domestic ticket and hotel packages for sporting events.\n\nAs the business has ceased trading, they would no longer be valid, although anyone with trips planned could try contacting the destination direct.\n\nFor example, Thomas Cook would have sold 360 hospitality packages for home matches at Liverpool football club's Anfield ground.\n\n\"We are currently assessing the impact of Thomas Cook ceasing trading and the impact for those supporters who have purchased packages from Thomas Cook. Once we have those details from Thomas Cook, we will update supporters,\" the football club said.\n\nAs most people would not have any insurance cover for such a trip, a refund claim would probably have to be made to the provider of the credit or debit card used to pay.\n\nWhat should I do if I work for Thomas Cook?\n\nWhile customers will be worried about their holidays, staff will be heartbroken about their livelihoods.\n\nStaff are being informed about what has happened to their jobs, with written confirmation to follow.\n\nA group of special managers have been appointed and will contact staff with a case reference number which will allow them to make a claim for redundancy payments.\n\nThe Pension Protection Fund (PPF) should step in to protect the more than 13,000 members of Thomas Cook's four pension schemes.\n\nWorkers who are over the age of their normal retirement will get full benefits, those who have not yet reached normal retirement age will be paid 90% of their promised pension, up to a cap of \u00a340,000. Members with bigger pensions will get at least 50% of their old age pensions, under PPF rules.\n\nMeanwhile the 3,000 or so retired members of Thomas Cook's pension schemes will continue to have their pensions paid in full by the trustees.", "description": "The travel company has collapsed, affecting hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers.
