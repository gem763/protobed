Edward Holmes Whalen, then a staffer on the Senate\u2019s Indian Affairs Committee, had presented a rather novel justification in his application \u2014 working with the Trump administration, he said, posed great danger.\n\n\u201cI believe either me or my family, while traversing the State of Maryland,\u201d Whalen wrote, \u201care at a greater risk to be exposed to hostile encounters with individuals who vehemently (and violently) oppose the President\u2019s vision for our country, particularly as it relates to foreign policy and terrorism.\u201d\n\nWhalen\u2019s application was denied. He appealed and lost. And now his case is in front of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals with backing from Maryland Shall Issue, a gun rights organization pursuing legal and legislative paths \u201cto promote and defend the right of armed defense that belongs to every responsible, law-abiding Marylander.\u201d\n\nWhalen\u2019s challenge against Maryland is one of dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of test cases that gun rights advocates have brought in state and federal courts around the country following the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller . In that 5-to-4 decision, the justices ruled that the Second Amendment guaranteed individuals the right to own guns regardless of military service.\n\nBut states and federal courts have yet to definitively sort out a crucial question raised by Whalen and others \u2014 whether the constitutional right extends beyond a gun owner\u2019s home. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit has previously ruled in Maryland\u2019s favor, holding that \u201cas we move outside the home, firearm rights have always been more limited, because public safety interests often outweigh individual interests in self-defense.\u201d\n\nLegal experts say the issue is barreling toward the Supreme Court.\n\nAll of the post-Heller litigation revolves around a set of important questions: \u201cWhere can you take guns? What kind of guns are protected?\u201d said Darrell A.H. Miller, co-director of Duke University\u2019s Center for Firearms Law.\n\nIn Maryland, citizens who want to carry a gun outside the home must file an application with the State Police. Applicants are required to pass a criminal-background check and a handgun training course. Most critically, they must prove a \u201cgood and substantial reason\u201d to carry a gun \u201csuch as finding that the permit is necessary as a reasonable precaution against danger.\u201d\n\nWhalen, who declined to comment for this article, lives in the District, though he can \u201cliterally throw a baseball\u201d from his home into Maryland, according to his testimony during his appeal. To drive into Maryland with a handgun, Whalen would need a permit, which he applied for in March 2017. His application was denied that July.\n\nWhalen, then 34, set off on an odyssey of reviews and appeals, first on his own and then with legal representation provided by Maryland Shall Issue. In letters of appeal and testimony before a state review board, Whalen offered several justifications for his application.\n\nOne of them was his father, Laurence J. Whalen, a federal tax judge.\n\n\u201cIndividuals may seek retribution for opinions or rulings that were not in their favor,\u201d Whalen wrote, arguing he needed a firearm to defend \u201cmyself, and my family, were such an incident to occur while in my father\u2019s company.\u201d\n\nAnother reason: Whalen had been the victim of identity fraud in 2007 by a man in California. Whalen pursued the suspect \u201cvigorously,\u201d therefore necessitating his need to arm himself, he said.\n\nIn addition, Whalen served as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in Ward 3. \u201cI regularly encounter constituents with strong feelings about my decisions,\u201d Whalen wrote.\n\nBut it was Whalen\u2019s Trump argument that caught the attention of legal experts.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the political and social climate in the D.C. Metropolitan Area has become divisive and, at times, violent,\u201d Whalen wrote. \u201cThe threat of violence that is assumed by members of Congress, and their Staff, is very real.\u201d\n\n[At a congressional baseball practice, a burst of gunfire and a lawmaker down]\n\nIn a separate letter, Whalen referenced the 2017 attack on several members of the Republican congressional baseball team while they practiced in Alexandria, Va. \u201cThis kind of attack is especially disturbing in the context of threats I have received in the past as a personal office staffer,\u201d Whalen wrote.\n\nMaryland\u2019s Handgun Permit Review Board, which reviews appeals of denials by the State Police, agreed with an initial finding that Whalen offered no evidence of threats. The board itself is under some dispute, with Gov. Larry Hogan (R) recently vetoing legislation to dissolve the entity \u2014 made up of political appointees \u2014 in favor of administrative judges.\n\nAs for Whalen\u2019s political climate justification, Miller, the co-director of Duke\u2019s gun law center, said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to make of it. I haven\u2019t seen an argument that says the political climate is really decaying and therefore I need a firearm because of the political climate. I just have never heard of anything like that before.\u201d\n\nBut now that the case has reached the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, Whalen\u2019s threat justifications don\u2019t really matter.\n\nIn legalese, Maryland is a \"may issue\" state. The state may issue a license if it finds there is a \"good and substantial reason.\"\n\nWhalen and gun rights organizations want Maryland to become a \u201cshall issue\u201d state, meaning that if an applicant passes objective hurdles such as a criminal-background check and training course, they should be issued a license to carry. Roughly two dozen states, including Virginia, are considered \u201cshall issue\u201d states.\n\nWhalen has already passed those hurdles.\n\n\u201cExercising a right does not depend on whether or not you have a special need, or a \u201cgood and substantial reason,\u201d in the state\u2019s parlance,\u201d said Mark W. Pennak, the president of Maryland Shall Issue. \u201cYour right to report in the newspaper does not depend on whether or not you have a special need to report.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution, Pennak added, provides that right \u201cto the people, and not a subclass of the people.\u201d\n\nIn Whalen\u2019s appeal in Maryland, his lawyers argued the court \u201cshould thus strike down the good and substantial reason requirement and order the issuance of the permit.\u201d\n\nEven John Adams \u2014 or the ghost of John Adams \u2014 gets the point, they wrote.\n\n\u201cIn defending the British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre, John Adams conceded that, in this country, \u2018every private person is authorized to arm himself; and on the strength of this authority I do not deny the inhabitants had a right to arm themselves at that time for their defense.\u2019\u201d", "description": "A Republican Senate staffer has appealed the state\u2019s strict concealed-carry law, saying he must protect himself against people who don\u2019t like the president.", "authors": ["Michael S.
