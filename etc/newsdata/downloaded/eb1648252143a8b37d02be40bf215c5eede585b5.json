(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Washington manager Dave Martinez says Stephen Strasburg will start Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nStrasburg, who earned the win in relief with three shutout innings in a dramatic NL wild-card victory over Milwaukee, will get the ball on Friday against Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw.\n\nStrasburg struck out four and walked none on 34 pitches in Tuesday\u2019s elimination game. He made the first relief appearance of his career, taking over for starter Max Scherzer.\n\nThe right-hander Strasburg says he\u2019s fully recovered from the wild-card game and ready to go. He was 18-6 with a 3.32 ERA and threw an NL-high 209 innings during the regular season.\n\nBy starting Strasburg in Game 2, he\u2019s available to return on normal rest for a potential Game 5 next Wednesday back in Los Angeles.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts says with Kershaw going in Game 2, the left-hander would be available to possibly pitch out of the bullpen if Game 5 is necessary.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: and", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Washington manager Dave Martinez says Stephen Strasburg will start Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.", "authors": ["Beth Harris", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
