To pursue her passion over the last decade she has dressed up first as a boy and later as a bearded man to attend games. She has been arrested and handcuffed and detained in jail, all because since 1981 Iran has barred women from attending soccer matches.\n\nSo when the ban was finally lifted \u2014 though only partially \u2014 on Thursday for a World Cup qualifier between Iran and Cambodia, it would have been natural for Sahafi to be among the 4,000 women who eagerly bought tickets and entered the Azadi stadium, the cavernous arena in western Tehran where the national team plays its home games.", "description": "For years, Zeinab Sahafi disguised herself as a man to slip into soccer matches in Iran. But when the government finally opened stadiums to women, she was left out.", "authors": ["Tariq Panja"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/sports/10iran-soccer-fan1/10iran-soccer-fan1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
