It\u2019s pitched at a whopping $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nAnd he would double down by coupling it with an irresponsible \u2014 and, in all likelihood, unconstitutional \u2014 national rent-control scheme.\n\nIn a Sept. 14 speech in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders said he would pay for his latest boondoggle by establishing a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on the top one-tenth of the \u201c1 percenters\u201d \u2014 by his calculations, the wealthiest 175,000 families.\n\nAren\u2019t these the same sitting ducks \u2014 to mix a waterfowl metaphor \u2014 who Mr. Sanders has vowed he would take aim at to come up with much of the money for his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d scheme? That government takeover of health care would carry a price tag estimated by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University at a mindboggling $32.6 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThe 1 percenters are the same geese whose golden eggs also would need to be scrambled to finance Mr. Sanders\u2018 \u201cCollege for All\u201d omelet. Far from \u201cfree,\u201d it would, as proposed, cost $47 billion a year.\n\nThe Vermonter says his latest spending initiative is aimed at addressing what he called \u201cthe outrageously high price of housing.\u201d To that end, the rent-control component of legislation that would vastly expand federal housing programs would cap annual rent increases at no more than 1.5 times the rate of inflation or 3 percent, whichever is higher.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable to me that there is virtually no place in America where a full-time, minimum-wage worker can afford a decent two-bedroom apartment at a time when half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Mr. Sanders claimed, albeit without citing any sourcing for that blanket assertion.\n\nThat was a variation on an assertion Mr. Sanders had made in a July 30 Democratic debate, at which he said, \u201cTonight, half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck\u201d\n\nBut as Time magazine wrote in a fact-check of the latter claim after the debate: \u201cWhile the data on exactly how many Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck isn\u2019t exact, a 2018 Federal Reserve report found that four in 10 adults said they would not be able to cover a surprise expense of $400 without going into debt or selling something.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s a comparison of apples and oranges, and hardly buttresses Mr. Sanders\u2018 claim.\n\nThe Vermont independent was joined Sept. 25 by a kindred spirit, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, who introduced what she called a \u201csuite\u201d of proposals dubbed \u201cA Just Society.\u201d The second of six planks in the platform is the Place to Prosper Act, which \u201cwould protect low-income tenants\u201d by \u201camong other things imposing a 3 percent national cap on annual rent increases.\u201d\n\nBut if Mr. Sanders and Miss Ocasio-Cortez are going to take their political cues from Swedes (i.e., Greta Thunberg, age 16) on global warming, they would do well to heed a pair of Swedish economists on rent control. Despite regarding themselves as socialists, both said there are few economic concepts more counterproductive and destructive than rent control.\n\nEconomist Gunnar Myrdal, who won a Nobel Prize in 1974 and is recognized as an architect of Sweden\u2019s welfare state, said, \u201cRent control has in certain Western countries constituted, maybe, the worst example of poor planning by governments lacking courage and vision.\u201d\n\nAssar Lindbeck, another Swedish socialist economist, was more blunt, writing in a 1971 book: \u201cIn many cases, rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city \u2014 except for bombing.\u201d\n\nAs anyone who has ever taken Econ 101 knows \u2014 or should know \u2014 that\u2019s because, as Sam Bowman of the free-market Adam Smith Institute explained: \u201cPutting a price ceiling on any product below the market rate causes shortages: Demand outstrips supply.\u201d\n\nFor someone who proudly champions socialist \u201ceconomic justice,\u201d Mr. Sanders has done extraordinarily well for himself financially \u2014 much better, in fact, than most capitalists.\n\nAs Fox News reported back in February, Mr. Sanders owns three houses, including a four-bedroom Vermont lakefront home he bought in 2016 for $575,000.\n\nRather than pushing dubious rent-control nostrums, Mr. Sanders could do more for affordable housing if he were to redistribute his own wealth and simply donate one of those three homes to a needy Vermont family.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
