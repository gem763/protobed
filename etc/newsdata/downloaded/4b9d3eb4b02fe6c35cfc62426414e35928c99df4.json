Instead, he provided a road map for investigators by quoting others around Mr. Trump describing his actions and statements.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has done nothing wrong \u2014 this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution,\u201d Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo. Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically motivated, closed-door, secretive hearings.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor\u2019s testimony once again focused attention on Mr. Trump\u2019s unusual relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia. Unlike most leaders in both parties, Mr. Trump has rarely expressed much criticism of Mr. Putin or his aggression against his neighbors, at one point even suggesting that he could accept Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine through force in 2014.\n\nMr. Trump went further than Mr. Obama by providing lethal military assistance to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia, but privately echoed Mr. Putin\u2019s line about the Ukrainians being untrustworthy and corrupt. By holding up the $391 million in aid allocated by Congress, Mr. Trump essentially reversed his own policy and angered lawmakers of both parties, who finally pressured him into releasing the money last month.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decisions benefiting Russia confound Democrats and Republicans alike. Even as Mr. Taylor testified, Mr. Putin hosted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in Moscow to seal an agreement in which Russian troops will join Turkish forces to control a swath of northern Syria just abandoned by American-backed Kurdish fighters after Mr. Trump abruptly abandoned them and pulled out United States troops.\n\nIn his 14-page opening statement, bristling with indignation yet chock-full of dates, facts and quotes, Mr. Taylor on Tuesday described \u201ctwo channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular,\u201d run largely by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, as well as others like Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union.\n\nMr. Taylor made clear that what he found particularly egregious about the president\u2019s actions was what he regarded as the betrayal of a friend to the not-so-tender mercies of a ruthless invader for corrupt reasons.", "description": "William B. Taylor Jr. laid out in visceral terms the potentially life-or-death stakes of what he saw as an illegitimate scheme to pressure Kiev for political help by suspending American security aid.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/us/politics/22dc-assess3/22dc-assess-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
