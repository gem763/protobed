She said: \u201cWe want to present the Netherlands as an open, inventive and inclusive country. We\u2019ve modernised our approach.\n\n\u201cWhat is special is that agreement has now been reached with relevant parties from both the government, Netherlands Board of Tourism and Conventions and private organisations including top sectors and the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers about the image of the Netherlands that we want to present to the rest of the world in a substantive and unambiguous manner.\u201d\n\nShe said the government was taking a a user-friendly and pragmatic approach to its name in order to boost exports, tourism, sport and spread \u201cDutch culture, norms and values\u201d. She said: \u201cIt has been agreed that the Netherlands, the official name of our country, should preferably be used.\u201d\n\nNorth and South Holland are provinces on the western coast of the Netherlands. From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland was one political unified entity and ruled by the counts of Holland.\n\nBy the 17th century it was the dominant part of what was then the Dutch Republic. The kingdom of the Netherlands, from the Dutch Neder-landen, meaning low countries, emerged out of the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nEarlier this year, the Dutch tourist board, whose website address is Holland.com, said it would be moving its focus from promoting the Netherlands as a whole to drawing attention instead to less well-known parts of the country.\n\nAs many as 42 million people are forecast to visit the country annually by 2030, up from 18 million in 2018. Amsterdam\u2019s well-known attractions are a major pull factor, leading to complaints of overcrowding in the Dutch capital.", "description": "As part of new strategy, the Netherlands will be official name at Eurovision in May", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d9da6df6d28a59ea094285d2d06695008a4985c/0_412_5521_3311/master/5521.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8098b7c15a596c4d7bd730147006cc4b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
