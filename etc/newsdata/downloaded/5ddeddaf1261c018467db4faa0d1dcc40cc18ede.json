No other state reported significant changes.\n\nClaims were somewhat elevated in Ohio and Michigan, two states with large concentrations of General Motors GM, +0.26% workers who had been on strike, but the impasse had little effect overall on the U.S. labor market.\n\nThe more stable monthly average of new claims rose by 1,000 to 214,750. The four-week average gives a more accurate read into labor-market conditions than the more volatile weekly number.\n\nThe number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, declined by 10,000 to 1.68 million. These claims have been below 2 million since early 2017.\n\nRead: U.S. adds 136,000 jobs in September, unemployment rate hits 50-year low\n\nBig picture: Businesses have cut back on hiring in response to a slowing U.S. economy, but they still aren\u2019t cutting many jobs\n\nAn extremely low unemployment rate, ironically, might be part of the reason firms are reluctant to reduce payrolls. They worry they won\u2019t be able to find skilled workers to fill open positions if the economy speeds up again. Instead they\u2019ve resorted to cutting hours in industries such as retail and manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. is unlikely to experience a sharp rebound in hiring until the ongoing trade tensions with China ease, executives and economists say. The spat has been widely blamed for causing growth in the U.S. and around the world to slow.\n\nWhat they are saying?: \u201cClaims remain near historically low levels and reflect a very solid labor market,\u201d said Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies LLC.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.33% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.57% rose in early Thursday trades.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.30% was little changed at 1.76%. The yield has fallen about 45% in the past year, tugging mortgage rates down at the same time.
