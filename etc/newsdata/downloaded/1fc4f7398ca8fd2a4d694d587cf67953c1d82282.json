Frank Lampard's team have been one of the best attacking units in the league in recent weeks and really should have scored more than two against Brighton last time out.\n\nSouthampton have been competitive against the bigger teams though, drawing with Man Utd (perhaps a disappointing result in hindsight) and losing narrowly to Liverpool when Danny Ings missed a late chance to level.\n\nThey look more comfortable when opponents try to dominate possession and build play from the back, inviting them to execute the pressing for which Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is renowned. When asked to take the initiative in games, Southampton can stutter.\n\nI was not sure if a Chelsea player would reach 10 league goals this season, but Tammy Abraham has been proving me wrong and thoroughly deserves his England call-up with team-mate Fikayo Tomori.\n\nAt the Emirates, Arsenal host Bournemouth in a fixture they usually excel in: 5-1, 3-0 and 3-1 are the scorelines from the last three league meetings in north London.\n\nBournemouth have neither the inclination nor ability to sit deep and frustrate, and there are question marks over their belief levels in these away trips to big clubs when they tend to be quite brittle.\n\nManager Eddie Howe admitted as much saying: \"We haven't started well at the Emirates Stadium in recent years so we need to start better. They're dangerous and we'll have to be at our best.\"\n\nNevertheless, in Ryan Fraser, Harry Wilson, Josh King and notably Callum Wilson they do possess goal threat and speed on the counter-attack.\n\nArsenal are likely to have Calum Chambers and Sead Kolasinac at full-back with Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney having their fitness managed, and Bournemouth will fancy getting some change out of both. There could be goals at both ends.\n\nTeam news on the way shortly. Chelsea is the televised game, so that will be our main focus but we will have goal updates from Arsenal plus as much detail as we can squeeze in.", "description": "Before the season started, Matt Law looked at Mount's development as part of our Season of the Superkid series.", "authors": ["Daniel Zeqiri", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212193428-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeuRHplZSizlnIpEPA_wgcqjC27eYLoCS8SbkeJKNEXE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
