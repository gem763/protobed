(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar)\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK is especially proud of The Indianapolis Star\u2019s investigative reporters whose commitment to impactful journalism was highlighted by the sentencing of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar this week. In August 2016, the IndyStarbroke the story about USA Gymnastics\u2019 failure to report allegations of sexual abuse by coaches to authorities. Following publication of that stunning \u201cOut of Balance\u201d piece, Rachael Denhollander of Louisville, Ky., courageously emailed the IndyStar explaining that Dr. Larry Nassar had abused her under the guise of medical treatment, and in September 2016, the IndyStar broke the news about Nassar, who was working at Michigan State University at the time.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of IndyStar\u2019s dogged reporting and in awe of the victims\u2019 courage to share their stories, which led to Nassar\u2019s sentencing,\u201d said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president, USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cThe conversation they have started about sexual abuse will continue to make an impact in the sports world and beyond. This week underscored why we do what we do as journalists.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that a story has such broad and sustained impact. Our newsroom truly rallied around the coverage. The time and expense of this investigation was not small, but we felt that it paled in comparison to the importance of the story,\u201d said Jeff Taylor, Midwest regional editor for the USA TODAY NETWORK and VP of News/Indianapolis. \u201cWe are grateful for the support of the broader USA TODAY NETWORK, which helped amplify the story to a national audience, and to the newsroom in Lansing, which played a crucial role as the Nassar story unfolded.\u201d\n\nLed by editors Jeff Taylor, Ronnie Ramos, Alvie Lindsay and Steve Berta (who supervises investigations), IndyStar journalists Marisa Kwiatkowski, Tim Evans, Mark Alesia and Robert Scheer have continued to diligently follow the story about USA Gymnastics for nearly two years. In 2017, they were recognized for their efforts with the prestigious Tom Renner Award, a national honor from Investigative Reporters and Editors. Other awards include:\n\nFinalist in print/online (medium circulation) category for \u201cOut of Balance,\u201d Investigative Reporters and Editors contest\n\nTop ten in investigative reporting for \u201cOut of Balance,\u201d Associated Press Sports Editors contest\n\nStory of the year in the Society of Professional Journalists\u2019 Best of Indiana Journalism contest\n\nLegacy House, a nonprofit in Indiana, presented an award to the IndyStar \u201cin recognition for support to victims of violence.\u201d\n\nMost importantly, \u201cOut of Balance\u201d helped lead to Nassar\u2019s sentencing of 40 to 175 years in prison. One hundred and fifty six other women have bravely shared their experiences while standing in front of him in court over the past week and a half. They are the very reason for the IndyStar reporters\u2019 passionate efforts. The Lansing Journal and The Detroit Free Press, both members of the USA TODAY NETWORK, have also contributed crucial coverage of Nassar\u2019s case and trial.\n\nAt Nassar\u2019s sentencing Wednesday, Michigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis emphasized the important role journalists play in illuminating stories hidden in the darkness of society. \"We as a society need investigative journalists more than ever,\" Povilaitis said. \"What finally started this reckoning and ended this decades-long cycle of abuse was investigative reporting.\"\n\nThe reporting has received national recognition from the likes of the New York Times,Washington Post,Fast Company,CNN and USA TODAY.\n\nBeyond that, journalists have taken to social media to express their appreciation for the investigative reporting about USA Gymnastics.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper tweeted, \u201cAlso deserving of huge praise in bringing about this day of reckoning: The Indianapolis Star. @indystar Thank you for the work you do.\u201d\n\nAdam Goldman of The New York Times tweeted, \u201cWhen the @indystar published in 2016 its stories on USA Gymnastics\u2019 failure to protect young athletes, I thought the paper deserved a @PulitzerPrize. I still think that today. You rarely see this kind of impact in journalism.\u201d\n\nKelly McBride of Poynter said on Twitter, \u201cImportant to note: this investigation was done by local journalists at the IndyStar, which is owned by Gannett. They should get credit for supporting a very expensive investigation.\u201d\n\nJamil Smith, who writes for The Huffington Post and The Los Angeles Times, tweeted, \u201cNassar isn\u2019t in prison without this journalism.
