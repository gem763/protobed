REUTERS/Christian Mang/File Photo\n\nThe party\u2019s Winfried Kretschmann - the popular premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg, one of Germany\u2019s richest and most industrialized states - said the package had been dominated by piecemeal measures and failed to take the key step: introducing an \u201chonest and ambitious carbon price\u201d.\n\nThe climate package, unveiled on Friday after extensive haggling between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and her Social Democrat coalition partners, set an initial carbon price of about 10 euros per ton, well short of the 40 euros many activists were hoping for.\n\nThe Federal Council, Germany\u2019s upper house, represents the governments of the 16 states of the federation, in nine of which the Greens are a governing party, meaning they have an influence over an absolute majority of seats in the chamber.\n\nAnnalena Baerbock, the Greens\u2019 co-leader, said the government had \u201cwasted a historic opportunity\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will use every means to get more done to protect the climate,\u201d she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.\n\nThe Federal Council can veto or amend laws that affect states\u2019 finances and refer back all other laws to the lower house for reconsideration.\n\nThe 50 billion euro package, setting out a roadmap for the greening of Europe\u2019s largest economy over coming decades, included incentives to buy electric cars, surcharges for domestic flights and extra money for the national railway.\n\nBut the carbon price, rising from 10 euros to 35 euros by 2025, was received with widespread disappointment.\n\n\u201cThe proposals are completely inadequate,\u201d climate economist Volker Quaschning told RTL. \u201cThe government is acting as if we had 200 years. If we did, then the measures would be fine, but not when we only have 15.\u201d\n\nWith environmental concerns surging up the list of voters\u2019 priorities after two unprecedentedly warm summers, a spate of forest fires and the chord struck by Great Thunberg\u2019s Fridays for Future movement, the Greens are soaring in polls, and are now vying with the conservatives for the top slot nationally.\n\nThe party looks set to enter its 10th state government within coming weeks after elections led to talks in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, on forming a coalition of the SPD, conservatives and Greens.", "description": "Germany's Greens said on Sunday they planned to use their strength in the upper house of parliament to sharpen a government climate protection package that disappointed many activists.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432636684&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0GB", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
