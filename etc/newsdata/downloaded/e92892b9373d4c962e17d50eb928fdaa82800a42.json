He writes: 'Truett Foster Mckeehan had joy that took the room when he entered. He was a magnetic son and brother and friend. If you met him you knew him, you remembered him. His smile, his laugh, the encouragement he offered with words or even without. He had an untamable grand personality and dreams to match. And he hated being put in a box. 'He expressed himself through the music he made. And by made I mean, written, recorded, produced, mixed, and designed the art. All of it. A true artist. His first show was a week ago, and it was nothing short of electric. 'Everyone felt it, everyone knew it. He could\u2019ve easily taken the easy route and put music out when he was 12, 14, 16, even 18, but he always said he wanted to live some life and have something to say before he did it. He didn\u2019t want to be a child star, he wanted to be a man with scars and a story to tell. I always admired, respected and encouraged that stand. 'Truett always had a soft spot for God. The Bible moved him. His heart was warm to the things of his King. He was by no means a cookie cutter Christian but give me a believer who fights to keep believing. Give me a broken man who recognizes his need for a Savior every time. That\u2019s who Truett was and how he should be remembered. 'My last moment with Truett in person was at his first show this past Thursday at the Factory in Franklin, Tennessee. I had to leave the next morning very early to fly and start our Canadian tour. As I stood in the audience and watched my son bring joy to a room, I was as proud as a \u201cpop\u201d (as tru called me) could be. 'It was the culminating moment of a dream that he had since he was 12. It couldn\u2019t have been sweeter. Our music, and what we say lyrically couldn\u2019t be more different, but the outcome was much the same\u2026 offering a room full of people a few minutes of joy in a crazy world.'\n\nTobyMac is understood to have left during the middle of his week-long tour in Canada as news of the tragedy broke to be with his wife and other children.\n\nThe statement from his reps continued: 'Cause of death has not been determined. Toby was traveling back from Canada and did not get home to be with his family until after midnight last night so there is no statement.\n\n'We just ask that everyone please be respectful of their privacy during this time and allow them to grieve their loss.'\n\nRapper TobyMac, who has topped the Billboard's Christian Songs chart six times, left the tour earlier this week, citing a family emergency.\n\nA message to fans read: 'A recent situation has caused us to have to stop the TobyMac Canadian tour today.\n\n'This morning Toby received information of an emergency in his family, and he will be flying home to Nashville immediately.'\n\nTruett pictured left with his family, from left, Amanda, Leo, Judah, TobyMac, Marlee and Moses\n\nTobyMac is understood to have left during the middle of his week-long tour in Canada as news of the tragedy broke to be with his wife and other children.
