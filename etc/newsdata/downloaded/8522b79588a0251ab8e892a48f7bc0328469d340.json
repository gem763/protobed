The real question is how to stop them.\n\nFor Democrats, the answer is \u201cuniversal background checks.\u201d Their argument is that private sales, the so-called \u201cgun-show loophole,\u201d must be closed to keep would-be killers from getting their hands on firearms.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with this prescription: it would not have stopped any of the mass shootings we have seen in this century.\n\nBackground checks have no chance of working unless criminals are arrested and prosecuted. If you seriously threaten someone\u2019s life, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to buy a gun. One of us, Andrew Pollack, saw the disconnect first-hand between the rhetoric of gun control and the reality of mass murder.\n\nThe police came to the Parkland school shooter\u2019s house forty-five times, but he was never arrested. He committed multiple crimes in school, but he was never arrested. The mental health authorities evaluated him three times on his eighteenth birthday, with knowledge of his history and the fact that he wanted to buy a gun. But he was never committed.\n\nThe divide between the reality of what happened and the rhetoric from anti-gun activists could not have been starker. A background check would have done nothing because, despite the shooter\u2019s extreme efforts, Democratic policies in Broward ensured that he never got a background that would have prohibited from buying a gun.\n\nThe recent rash of shootings, followed by a similar chorus of logically disconnected activist campaigns, have pressured politicians to \u201cdo something\u201d this September. If gun control activists are acting in good faith, and Second Amendment stalwarts are willing to give some ground, there is room for productive compromise.\n\nThe details of a law requiring background checks for private gun sales could be constructed carefully and respectfully, to avoid a rash of false alarms and deeply inconveniencing urban and rural Americans alike.\n\nOne talking point we\u2019ll likely hear many times in the next few weeks: Background checks have stopped 3.5 million dangerous or prohibited people from buying guns. That is simply false.\n\nThere have been 3.5 million initial denials, but at least 96% and probably over 99%, of those denials are mistakes. The system relies largely on identifying phonetically similar names, causing false positives that overwhelmingly discriminate against poor and middle-income blacks and Hispanics. It\u2019s one thing to stop a felon from buying a gun. But it\u2019s quite another to stop someone from getting a gun because their name resembles a felon\u2019s.\n\nIf politicians want background checks to stop criminals from getting guns, rather than create headline-driving, racially-biased false-positives, there is a simple fix: require that the government does background checks in the same way that the government forces private companies to do background checks on employees \u2013 make them use all the information available, including exact names and birthdates.\n\nIn New York City and Washington, D.C., background checks on private gun transfers cost at least $125. These costs present a genuine obstacle to poor people living in high-crime, urban areas. The law-abiding potential victims of violent crimes are the least able to afford these costs. Gang members won\u2019t pay them. Democrats who think that voter ID laws are unfairly onerous for poor minorities ought to appreciate the obstacles presented by background check fees.\n\nBesides, if we sincerely believe that background checks reduce crime and save lives, we shouldn\u2019t effectively tax Americans for going through the process. If everyone benefits from background checks, everyone should pay for them. They ought to be funded out of general revenue.\n\nUnder the Democratic House bill, actions that would be entirely reasonable could become criminal. Imagine a stalker threatens a female friend of yours, and she asks to borrow your gun. She is trained and has no criminal record. Should you let her protect herself? If House has its way, you could land in prison for doing so. The only exception is \u201cimminent danger,\u201d i.e., if she asks to borrow your gun while her stalker is charging at her.\n\nThe Trump administration has floated the idea of an App that could be used to check whether people are eligible to buy guns. People would be required to check the app or else face criminal consequences. That\u2019s one potential solution. Another: simply requiring a reasonable person standard: would a reasonable person believe that the woman being stalked is in danger?\n\nAn App would cut the costs of background checks and also solve problems for rural Americans. One of us lives in a rural area. Private transfer background checks would require some Americans to travel for miles to do what could be accomplished instantly with a smartphone.\n\nMany on the right are worried that universal background checks will be used to create a national registry. Ever since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System was set up in 1998, the federal government has been prevented from creating a national registry because background check information must be destroyed within 24 hours after the completing the check.\n\nUniversal background checks can be a slippery slope, if, say, five years from now a Democratic president requires licensed dealers turn over all that information to the federal government, thus creating an instant national registry on all legally owned guns.\n\nBut again, there is a simple solution: just as with the Federal government now, put a time limit on how long the licensed dealers must keep this background check information.\n\nThe divide between the reality of what causes mass shootings and the rhetoric of gun control advocates is stark. But if they are sincere about taking concrete steps to make it more difficult for dangerous people to buy guns, then there are paths to compromise.\n\nColor us skeptical that during a Presidential primary, Democrats will be willing to cut a smart deal with President Trump. But if they are more interested in regulations they believe will save lives than talking points they think will harm Trump, a few thoughtful changes could get a bill passed.\n\nJohn Lott is President of the Crime Prevention Research Center, and on Wednesday he testified before the Joint Economic Committee hearing on various gun control laws.
