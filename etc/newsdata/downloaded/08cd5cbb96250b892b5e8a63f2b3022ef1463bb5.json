On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) distributed a \u201cfact sheet\u201d outlining what her office called a gross abuse of presidential power, including a \u201cshakedown,\u201d a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d and a \u201ccoverup.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfTrump slams Democrats and chides Republicans as allies criticize his erratic impeachment response.\n\n\u25cfRussian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban helped sour Trump on Ukraine.\n\n\u25cfHouse asks judge to toss Trump lawsuit to shield his N.Y. state tax returns from lawmakers.\n\n9:45 a.m.: Neither party wins positive marks for handling of impeachment\n\nNeither party wins positive marks from Americans for their handling of the impeachment inquiry, according to a new poll, though Republicans fare worse.\n\nAD\n\nForty-three percent approve of how Democrats are handling the inquiry, while 49 percent disapprove, according to the poll released Tuesday by CNN that was conducted by SSRS.\n\nAD\n\nBy contrast, 30 percent of Americans approve of Republicans are handling the impeachment inquiry, while 57 percent disapprove.\n\n9:30 a.m.: Democrats consider response to Trump\u2019s \u2018lynching\u2019 description\n\nLeading Democrats started talking Tuesday morning about how to respond to Trump calling the impeachment inquiry a \u201clynching,\u201d with one leaving open the possibility of a vote on the floor to condemn his remarks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about what the response is,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said. \u201cThe problem is, this president minute-by-minute saying things that are outrageous, and the problem is keeping up with the outrages.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsked if Trump was trying to distract from other issues, Hoyer said, \u201cAll the time. All the time.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said he planned to discuss Trump\u2019s tweet with the Congressional Black Caucus and left open the possibility of a floor vote condemning Trump\u2019s characterization.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI resent it tremendously,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cI think that what we see here once again is this president attempting to change the narrative by using what I consider to be real caustic terms in order to change the conversation. To compare the constitutional process to something like lynching is far beneath the office of president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPelosi did not respond to questions from reporters at the Capitol about the issue.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, called the tweet \u201cterrifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely disoriented and deranged,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cImpeachment is a lawful, constitutional process. It is not criminal in nature. ... If he is impeached and removed, he will not spend one day in jail as a result of congressional action much less be harmed in any physical way. So it\u2019s an obscene analogy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRaskin recommended Trump visit the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala.\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n9:25 a.m.: Taylor arrives at Capitol for deposition\n\nTaylor has arrived at the Capitol for his scheduled deposition before three House panels conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nHis testimony may fill in some blanks about the activities of U.S. officials who appear to have sought Ukrainian help at the behest of Trump and his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani Jr., although it was not clear how much Taylor knew.\n\n\u2014 Anne Gearan\n\nRead more here .\n\n8:45 a.m.: Trump swiftly condemned for use of term \u2018lynching\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the term lynching drew swift condemnation Tuesday morning from Democrats and civil rights leaders.\n\n\u201cYou think this impeachment is a LYNCHING? What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d tweeted Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.). \u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cExample No. 5286 as to why this President is unfit for office,\u201d Rush added in a separate tweet.\n\n\u201cYou are a disgrace,\u201d Rep. David Trone (D-Md.) said in a tweet responding to Trump.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, a former Cabinet secretary under President Barack Obama and 2020 presidential candidate, said in a tweet that it was \u201cbeyond shameful to use the word \u2018lynching\u2019 to describe being held accountable for your actions.\u201d\n\nKristin Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, cited some history in a tweet responding to Trump.\n\n\u201cA lynching?!\u201d she wrote. \u201c4,743 people were lynched in the US between 1882 - 1968, incl. 3,446 African Americans. Lynchings were crimes against humanity and an ugly part of our nation\u2019s history of racial violence and brutality. Sickened to see Trump\u2019s gross misappropriation of this term today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n8:05 a.m.: Clyburn chastises Trump for use of term \u2018lynching\u2019\n\nHouse Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201clynching\u201d to describe the impeachment inquiry offended his sense of history.\n\n\u201cThat is one word that no president ought to apply to himself,\u201d Clyburn said after being read Trump\u2019s tweet during a CNN interview. \u201cThis president is hopefully an anomaly.\u201d\n\nAsked if the word offends his sense of history, Clyburn replied, \u201cVery much so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just a politician up here,\u201d said Clyburn, who is African American. \u201cI\u2019m a Southern politician. I\u2019m a product of the South. I know the history of that word. That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n7:55 a.m.: Trump calls impeachment inquiry a \u2018lynching\u2019\n\nTrump on Tuesday called the impeachment inquiry a \u201clynching,\u201d a racially loaded reference certain to inflame Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nTrump used the term in a morning tweet in which he suggested he was not being afforded due process by the Democrat-led House.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\n7:25 a.m.: Trump highlights poll of battleground states\n\nTrump on Monday highlighted a poll released this week that found that voters in six battleground states oppose impeaching and removing him from office by a margin of 10 percentage points.\n\nThe New York Times-Siena College survey found that in the six closest states carried by Trump in 2016, registered voters support the impeachment inquiry by a five-point margin, 50 percent to 45 percent. But those same voters oppose impeaching Trump and removing him from office, 53 percent to 43 percent.\n\nAD\n\nIn a morning tweet, Trump quoted \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Brian Kilmeade discussing the poll.\n\n\u201cI thought a very revealing poll was done by The New York Times,\u201d Trump quoted Kilmeade as saying. \u201cBy about a 10 point margin, those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the President, and if Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t take note of that, maybe she is the third rate politician.\u201d\n\nTrump disparaged Pelosi at a White House meeting last week. Accounts differed over whether he called her a \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d or a \u201cthird-grade politician.\u201d\n\nSeveral recent national polls have showed higher levels of support for removing Trump from office than the survey of voters in battleground states.\n\nFifty percent of Americans expressed support for impeaching Trump and removing him from office in a poll released Tuesday by CNN that was conducted by SSRS.\n\n7 a.m.: Taylor scheduled for closed-door deposition\n\nHouse investigators are scheduled to hear Tuesday from Taylor, who raised alarms in text messages to other diplomats about a holdup in military aid while Trump was pressing Ukraine to investigate political rivals.\n\nIn his text messages, Taylor called it \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign\u201d and a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nDemocrats consider him among the key witnesses in the impeachment probe. He will be the latest official to be deposed behind closed doors by three House panels leading the inquiry.\n\nTaylor\u2019s texts are prominently featured in a four-page fact sheet released Monday by Pelosi\u2019s office that accuses Trump of a gross abuse of power, including a \u201cshakedown,\u201d a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d and a \u201ccoverup.\u201d\n\nTaylor took the job of acting ambassador to Ukraine on a temporary basis earlier this year after the sitting ambassador was abruptly recalled from her post in what she told the committees was political retaliation by the Trump administration.\n\nTaylor is a potentially damaging witness for Trump, because he appears to have no political or personal incentive to protect the administration. Unlike other State Department witnesses, he has neither his government career nor his personal standing with Trump at stake.\n\nTaylor is expected to return to his senior position at the U.S. Institute for Peace sometime next year.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Reeker deposition rescheduled for Saturday\n\nHouse Democrats plan a rare Saturday deposition of Ambassador Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, another witness in the impeachment probe.\n\nReeker\u2019s deposition was one of several this week rescheduled due to events honoring the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\n6 a.m.: Trump shares tweets of disappointed Republicans\n\nTrump went on Twitter on Monday night to share tweets from several Republicans who voiced disappointment in the party-line vote in the House to \u201ctable\u201d a resolution seeking to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for his handling of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cAs a cosponsor of the resolution to censure Rep. Adam Schiff, I was disappointed Nancy Pelosi did not even allow a vote on the House floor tonight,\u201d wrote Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) in one tweet shared by Trump. \u201cWe need transparency and accountability, not closed door secret meetings. What are they afraid of the American people seeing?\u201d\n\nSchiff also took to Twitter to respond to the failed Republican effort.", "description": "William B.
