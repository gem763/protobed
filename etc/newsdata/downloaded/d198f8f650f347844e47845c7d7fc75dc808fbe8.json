Still, he soon will enter uncharted territory.\n\nJacobs never was a full-time bell cow throughout his college career. Over three years at Alabama, he totaled 251 carries, never topping more than 120 in any single season. Of the 122 carries by Raiders running backs so far this season, 88 of them have gone to Jacobs.\n\nThe rookie has been productive with those attempts, averaging 4.9 yards per, and he has scored five touchdowns. Oakland has increased his workload in the wake of several injuries to its wide receivers, culminating with a career-best performance in the Raiders' Week 6 win over the Bears, in which Jacobs rushed 26 times for 123 yards and two scores.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAt 5-foot-10, 220 pounds, Jacobs has the physical traits to be an every-down back. But behind him are two similarly sized backs in Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington, both of whom are 5-8 and between 205 and 210 pounds. With Jacobs' backups being diminutive in stature, the Raiders reportedly went looking for a bigger-bodied bruiser.\n\nESPN's Field Yates reported Wednesday that Oakland worked out two free-agent running backs, both of which immediately would become the largest running back on the Raiders' roster, if they were signed.\n\nThe Raiders worked out free agent RB LeGarrette Blount, as well as RB Bo Scarborough. First known visit for Blount after spending 2018 with the Lions. \u2014 Field Yates (@FieldYates) October 16, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nOf those two backs, LeGarrette Blount is the more accomplished. A 10-year NFL veteran, Blount played for the Lions last season, rushing 154 times for 418 yards and five touchdowns. A short-yard specialist, Blount has 56 career rushing touchdowns to his name.\n\nBo Scarbrough has yet to appear in an NFL game, but he was on the Cowboys and Jaguars' practice squads last year before being signed by the Seahawks toward the end of the season. Interestingly enough, he and Jacobs overlapped for two years at Alabama, and Jacobs only moved into a featured role after Scarbrough departed.\n\n[RELATED: Why Jacobs is harsh grader even after biggest Raiders games]\n\nThe Raiders appear intent on relying on their run game, and while Jacobs affords them that ability, the stable of running backs could be rounded out a bit better. Whether it's Blount, Scarbrough or another power back, don't be surprised if there's a new addition to Oakland's running back room sometime soon.\n\nNFL rumors: Raiders work out running backs LeGarrette Blount, Bo Scarbrough originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "The Raiders' stable of running backs could be rounded out a bit better.", "authors": ["Brian Witt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hzqwnu9jt1JwukaQ_WPmwA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ar0NhvpIxj5p1PAp0cQoTA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/3524d48656bb31ef99effce7f1be8f30", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
