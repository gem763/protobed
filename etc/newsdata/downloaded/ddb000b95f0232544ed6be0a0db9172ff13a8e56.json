Thanks to the latest rollout of digital icons, soon we\u2019ll all be able to express our lack of enthusiasm in tiny circular form\n\nName: Yawning Face emoji.\n\nAge: Unveiled 224 days ago, as part of Emoji 12.0.\n\nAppearance: Whatever.\n\nI think you should at least make an effort to describe it. It\u2019s like a smiley face, but yawning. Happy?\n\nAnd it\u2019s new, is it? Honestly, it\u2019s just not that big a deal.\n\nI\u2019d just like to know where it comes from, is all. It\u2019s a really boring story.\n\nStill. Fine: like all emojis, the yawning emoji was born of a two-year process that starts with a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, an international nonprofit organisation that sets the standard for the representation of characters across various programmes and platforms.\n\nYou\u2019re kidding. I wish. In its most recent annual update, Unicode announced the introduction of Yawning Face \u2013 AKA U+1F971 \u2013 along with dozens of other emojis.\n\nBut who proposes new emojis in the first place? Anyone can submit a proposal, but successful emojis must meet all the criteria.\n\nWhich criteria? Emojis must be graphically legible when very small, and they have to be useful.\n\nWhat possible communicative uses could there be for a yawning emoji? Actually, now that it\u2019s here, I can\u2019t think of an occasion on which I wouldn\u2019t use it.\n\nBecause you\u2019re tired all the time? Tired, or bored, or supremely unconcerned, or merely underwhelmed, or peremptorily dismissive of enthusiasm shown by others.\n\nI see what you mean. What did we ever do without a yawning emoji? I can\u2019t remember. I think we used to type out the word \u201cyawn\u201d.\n\nEvery time? How tiresome. Exactly. Yawn.\n\nWhere is it, though? I can\u2019t find a yawning face among the sea of little round emoting heads on my phone\u2019s menu. That\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve got an iPhone. Each \u201cvendor\u201d is responsible for adding the new batches of emojis and Apple hasn\u2019t done so yet. Yawning Face will be included in the iOS 13.2 update, which is due out imminently; it has been rolled out on Twitter and Facebook, as well as Microsoft, Samsung and Google devices.\n\nSo, what other fun and useful emojis can we expect this autumn? There are some new hearing aid and wheelchair symbols, while the Holding Hands emoji will be available in 75 permutations of gender and skin tone. Also garlic, a plate of falafel and a five-string banjo.\n\nHuh. What if I wanted specifically to reference a four-string banjo? There\u2019s still time to get your proposal in for next year.\n\nDo say: \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about the new Yawning Face emoji [Yawning Face emoji].\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cMan, I stayed up so late last night!
