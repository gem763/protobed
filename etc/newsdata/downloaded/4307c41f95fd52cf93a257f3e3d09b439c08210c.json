Officials also cite their assessment of the current situation in Europe\u2019s biggest economy, as well as tactical considerations on how a stimulus package would be effective.\n\nSuch reasoning might be used often this week in Washington as Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and colleagues attend meetings of the International Monetary Fund, which on Tuesday called for Germany to invest more and reduce taxes to aid its faltering economy. Two days later, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government cut its growth forecast for 2020 to just 1%, after earlier predicting 1.5%. Data due next month may even show the economy has just slipped into recession.\n\nThe IMF is far from alone. Outgoing European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said last month that it is time for \u201cfiscal policy to take charge\u201d in the region, and is likely to repeat that refrain at his final meeting next week. Germany, with ample fiscal space built on repeated budget surpluses, is a prime candidate.\n\nWhile the opposition by some German lawmakers to a fiscal boost is starting to thaw, the government is holding firm for now. Here\u2019s a look at some of the arguments they\u2019re deploying to keep calls for stimulus at bay, based on public statements, private briefings, and confidential conversations with officials.\n\nStudying the Cycle\n\nOne argument is that Germany\u2019s slowdown doesn\u2019t fundamentally stem from domestic weakness and the economic cycle. It\u2019s a result of external and political factors, including global trade tensions and Brexit-related disruption. Such a situation isn\u2019t best served by a classic stimulus response and doesn\u2019t need measures that would normally counter the ebbing of the cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Appropriate\n\nA continuation of that point is that the economy is actually close to its speed limit, with areas such as construction, where a lack of workers is causing bottlenecks, threatening to constrain expansion. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann argued that on Wednesday, saying calls for German fiscal stimulus are \u201ccompletely disconnected\u201d from reality.\n\n\u201cThe economy is working with an almost-closed output gap,\u201d he said in response to questions at an event in New York. \u201cWhy would you spend money when you are operating at full capacity?\u201d\n\nTwo-Speed Economy\n\nGerman weakness has generally been limited to manufacturing and isn\u2019t widespread, runs another argument. The auto industry has suffered from trade tensions and a slow response to the global shift toward electric vehicles. But the domestic economy remains healthy, thanks to unemployment near a record low and the benefits of extreme monetary easing.\n\nThe line of reasoning holds that past spillovers from the industrial sector to the consumer aren\u2019t happening this time, because the link between the two is weaker than it was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-speed Germany,\u201d Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset management at Royal London Asset Management, told Bloomberg Television. \u201cThe consumer is okay, and the housing market is actually rising quite strongly.\u201d\n\nThe Time Isn\u2019t Right\n\nAnother view holds that a major budget stimulus should only be unveiled when it\u2019s widely perceived to be needed. A fiscal boost may be more potent if announced at a time when things are really seen to be deteriorating. That was the experience in 2009 during the global financial crisis. But if ordinary people aren\u2019t much feeling the effects of economic weakness, stimulus now could be less efficient than it otherwise would be.\n\nIt Needs Thought\n\nA further point Weidmann made this week is that stimulus should be well aimed and not just delivered for the sake of it, suggesting the need for caution. He recommended targeted spending on infrastructure, research and education, and incentivizing work and investment through tax cuts.\n\n\u201cIt would be important to use the leeway wisely in order to promote sustainable growth in the long run and not just cause a flash in the pan,\u201d he said.\n\nMerkel argued last month that simply spending cash isn\u2019t what\u2019s needed, saying \u201cit\u2019s currently not a lack of money\u201d that\u2019s the problem, and there are sufficient investment projects in the pipeline. They just need to be fast-tracked.\n\n--With assistance from Francine Lacqua.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Craig Stirling in Frankfurt at cstirling1@bloomberg.net;Birgit Jennen in Berlin at bjennen1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Kennedy at skennedy4@bloomberg.net, Paul Gordon, Jana Randow\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- When German officials get nagged about delivering major fiscal stimulus, they have plenty of answers ready for why now isn\u2019t the moment.Their arguments don\u2019t just rely on the national obsession with budget prudence and the avoidance of debt though.
