The officer shot Gross Polanco, who was unarmed, in his head.\n\n\u201cI ask myself how is it possible that a cop with so many other ways of solving the situation just shoots my brother in the face?\u201d Gross Polanco said. \u201cHe could have saved my brother\u2019s life with just one call. He left kids without their father and a family destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe murder highlights civil rights activists\u2019 concerns that Dominican immigrants are subject to police profiling and brutality in Puerto Rico and, in an age of increased scrutiny by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), are also being targeted for deportation on the island. It is a heavy burden for an already vulnerable community in Puerto Rico, often afraid to speak out about abuse or discrimination, or being singled out for violence.\n\n\u201cMany Dominicans have been murdered here in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican community leader who has lived in Puerto Rico for more than three decades.\n\nAnewki Gross Polanco, 25, had come to Puerto Rico in a yola (a small wooden boat) with his sister years before. It was a treacherous and sometimes deadly trek by water across the Mona Passage that many Dominican immigrants take each year to reach the island, hoping for a better life.\n\nHis sister says Gross Polanco had an appointment at the immigration office scheduled that week but he would never make it.\n\nOf the estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Dominicans living in Puerto Rico, Rodr\u00edguez says only a minority feel comfortable speaking out about any harassment they face or threat of deportation.\n\n\u201cMost of them are people who work, who do yard work, gardening, construction, welding, mechanics, cleaning; many women clean houses, take care of the elderly,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nThey have good reason to fear speaking out.\n\nAn investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (CPI), revealed Ice has shifted its focus to rounding up undocumented immigrants who have already established residency in Puerto Rico, a trend also reflected in the mainland US.\n\n\u201cWhen they get here to the federal prison, they quickly send them to Miami. They don\u2019t have funds. They don\u2019t have anyone there and if they don\u2019t have the resources to find a lawyer there, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that right now immigration has become a lucrative business. Flights to bring immigrants to their countries are a business.\u201d\n\n\u201cPuerto Rican and Dominican people get along very well because \u2026 we are Caribbean and we have the same blood, the same DNA \u2026 we\u2019re brothers,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez, referring to vibrant integrated communities where Dominicans have made roots on the island.\n\nBut despite the cultural integration, predominantly Dominican communities, such as Barrio Obrero, do exist in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cYou can still point out where the Dominicans live, it\u2019s like they are segregated to certain areas. Those areas are identified as poor neighborhoods and areas with high crime rate and more police patrolling,\u201d says Dr B\u00e1rbara I Abad\u00eda-Rexach, a sociology professor at the University of Puerto Rico.\n\nRodr\u00edguez said the profiling of Dominicans has both racial and ethnic components to it, as they may speak with a distinct Spanish accent and are often perceived as more likely to be afrodescendientes or of Afro-Latino heritage.\n\n\u201cThey stop you to corroborate you, they start talking to you to hear how you talk and that\u2019s what they use,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n\u201cWe had a case of a Puerto Rican in Caguas who was beaten because he was black. They thought he was Dominican because for the police, there are no black men here. If you\u2019re black, it\u2019s because you\u2019re Dominican.\u201d\n\nRace is a nuanced and at times complicated subject in Puerto Rico. Many Puerto Ricans take pride in the island as a racial utopia, which views itself as an equally valued mix of African, Taino native and Spanish heritage.\n\nThe distinct \u201cblack v white\u201d racial framework that operates in the United States, particularly in the context of police brutality, can\u2019t be copy-pasted on to Puerto Rico. But scholars say it doesn\u2019t mean ethnic prejudice and racism doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cPolicing blackness \u2026 gets folded into and justified through this xenophobia directed at Dominicans in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Marisol LeBr\u00f3n, professor and author of Policing Life and Death : Race, Violence, and Resistance in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cAnd in that way, Puerto Ricans\u2019 discomfort with anti-black racism gets displaced on to this policing of immigrants.\u201d\n\nBut officials often deny there is a systemic problem on the island.\n\nEric Vos, a chief federal public defender in Puerto Rico, said profiling and arrests of Dominicans in Puerto Rico, haven\u2019t been on the uptick in his office.\n\n\u201cAnything\u2019s possible. It\u2019s a question of probable,\u201d says Vos. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something that we see. If they were targeting disproportionately foreign nationals, Dominicans, we would see a much higher number statistically of immigration cases.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t happen in state cases or in other scenarios but it just does not bear out in the federal arena.\u201d\n\nWhile non-discrimination and equal protection is one of the 11 areas of reform compliance listed on the Puerto Rico police department\u2019s website, an explicit plan to address racial and ethnic profiling is not posted. Opinions on reform\u2019s success are varied.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, the cops here investigate themselves. Complaints aren\u2019t investigated for that, because it\u2019s between cops. In other words, they have made the reform useless,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nPolice leadership is what Karina Gross Polanco is still hoping for two years after her brother\u2019s murder.\n\nLast October a judge found the officer who shot him guilty of murder and sentenced him to 104 years in prison, but police convictions are still considered rare in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cNot all cops are the same, I have a few friends who are cops,\u201d said Gross Polanco, who still shows up regularly to the area where her brother was gunned down to place fresh flowers on a makeshift memorial. \u201cAt least now that rotten apple is gone and in jail. [But] if I don\u2019t do anything and push, he would have gotten free, he wouldn\u2019t be in jail.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.", "description": "Activists say Dominican immigrants are subject to police profiling and brutality, and are also being targeted for deportation", "authors": ["Natasha S Alford In Puerto Rico"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/686e15d0469c448135cfa7920d9dc8c8a6d7f2bd/0_213_4897_2939/master/4897.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f4433fd5bb444391c601eff0c8b277c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
