It\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s admission is a massive upping of the stakes of a deeply controversial saga surrounding his presidency.\n\nIn the past week, news reports have revealed that in a recent phone call, Trump pressed the new Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to investigate whether Joe Biden intervened on his son\u2019s behalf to fire a prosecutor who was allegedly being harmful to his business interests. News reports have shown that Biden did not play such a role.\n\nREUTERS More\n\nTrump, nevertheless, has insisted that there is more to the story. And, behind the scenes, he and his top adviser, Rudy Giuliani, have encouraged the new Ukraine leadership to keep digging into the allegation. Questions have surrounded whether the president sat for months on the security aid\u2014which has been given annually since the Russian invasion of Crimea\u2014in order to compel Zelenskyy to act.\n\nOn Monday, Trump admitted he had done just that. Earlier in the day, Giuliani had said he could not be \u201c100 percent\u201d certain that Trump didn\u2019t threaten to cut off military aid.\n\nTrump\u2019s call with Zelenskyy is reportedly the subject of a whistleblower complaint from an anonymous intelligence official, the content of which has yet to become public.\n\nTrump Whistleblower Saga Threatens to Blow Up 2020 Campaign\n\nThere\u2019s Never Been a Whistleblower Case Like This Before\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
