When they were really young, I used to bulk-cook a lot of meals as it was easy to just get them out of the freezer and serve them up whenever we'd all sit down to eat.\n\n'Now we have to get kids to and from extra-curricular activities like football practice and swimming lessons, and my husband works long hours as an assistant head teacher, so it'd be easy to find excuses not to sit down together every evening.\n\n'This is part of the reason I like to cook fresh from day to day now \u2013 it gets the kids into the kitchen as soon as they smell something cooking, so they're generally more involved and interested in the cooking process.\n\n'Not to mention I have more time as I'm no longer working long, stressful hours as a teacher.\n\nHer chicken with potato rosti, tomatoes and green beans (serves 4) and costs just \u00a38.92 for Emma to make - that's a per person: cost of \u00a32.23\n\nAnother of Emma's favourite dishes is turkey and mushroom mince with leeky potatoes (serves 4) Total: \u00a35.49 Per person: \u00a31.37\n\nUsing around \u00a327 worth of meat and just over \u00a324 of store cupboard essentials, Emma serves eight hearty yet balanced meals like casserole\n\n'Saying that, I do still bulk cook for my eldest daughter who is at uni. The stuffed jacket potatoes are perfect for this \u2013 you can just pop them out of the freezer and heat them up in the microwave if you want a quick meal or snack.'\n\nWhen eldest daughter Chloe is back from university, Emma usually find it quite hard cooking for a family of five as most supermarket products are packaged for four.\n\nBut she says that bulk buying high quality musclefood.com meat means she can pull out the right quantities from the freezer, and it saved on unnecessary packaging too.\n\nWhile she would once regularly bulk-cook and freeze meals, she now has more time to cook from scratch each day and get her youngest children Erin, 9 and Dylan, 15 involved in the kitchen - and Chloe (right) when she is home\n\nShe says that bulk buying high quality musclefood.com meat means she can pull out the right quantities from the freezer, and it saved on unnecessary packaging too\n\nEmma said: 'I'd never really thought about using an online retailer for meat, but I can't fault the process at all. The meat is great quality and goes a lot further than some supermarket alternatives \u2013 particularly the chicken breasts which were really chunky and filling.\n\n'It's important that my family eats fresh and nutritious food every day, so I try to squeeze extra veggies into dishes where possible.\n\n'Sweetcorn might not seem like a natural go-to for meatballs and pasta, for example, but my kids love it, so I just throw some in to pack out the meal a bit more.\n\n'By showing them how to cook healthy meals every day, I hope they'll be learning about basic nutrition and how to eat a balanced diet as they get older.'\n\nWhen eldest daughter Chloe (right) is back from university, Emma usually find it quite hard cooking for a family of five as most supermarket products are packaged for four\n\nPictured: Pasta and meatballs (serves 4) Pasta 49p Passata 40p Tinned sweetcorn 39p Musclefood meatballs (packet of 20) \u00a32.63 Total: \u00a33.91 Per person: 97p\n\nPasta and meatballs is one of Emma's favourite dishes", "description": "Emma Bradley, 43, from Gloucester,  spends just over \u00a350 for eight meals a week to feed her husband and their children Chloe, 19,\u00a0Dylan, 15, and Erin, 9 - just 97p per head.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19550460-0-image-a-6_1570726640074.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
