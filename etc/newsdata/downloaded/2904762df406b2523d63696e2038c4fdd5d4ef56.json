With so many young people abstaining from drinking altogether, there has concurrently been a rise in the \u201csober-curious\u201d movement, as coined by author Ruby Warrington in her 2019 book of the same name.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to get really clear about why you are abstaining,\u201d Warrington says. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re sick of hangovers, want to perform better at work, or have a health and fitness goal. It can help to write these reasons down somewhere you can access them easily, to remind yourself when you feel your resolve wavering.\u201d\n\nEmbrace sober firsts\n\nOnce you\u2019ve established your reasoning, Warrington says that you should continue to attend social functions, seeing them as \u201csober firsts\u201d. \u201cWeddings can be extra challenging, as these are some of our booziest get-togethers,\u201d she says. \u201cGo into these and any other \u2018sober firsts\u2019 with an open mind, and stay curious about what the experience will be like sober. If you\u2019re used to drinking, staying sober can even be a different kind of altered state \u2013 with all the surprises, the highs and the lows.\u201d\n\nPlan your alcohol substitutions\n\nWith the alcohol-free market expanding, and some estimates anticipating it to grow by a third in the next three years, there are plenty of options available to replace your usual tipple of choice at a social function. Warrington recommends a tonic with bitters as being \u201cmore grown up than ordering a Coke\u201d, while a record \u00a357m was spent on non-alcoholic beers in Britain over the past year.\n\nThe rise of the sober curious: having it all, without alcohol Read more\n\nDon\u2019t apologise for not drinking\n\nKate Bee, the founder of Sober School \u2013 a sobriety training course for women \u2013 emphasises the need to be confident about your decision. \u201cReally own it and never apologise for not drinking,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, smile brightly and say: \u2018I\u2019m not drinking at the moment and I can\u2019t believe how much I\u2019m enjoying it.\u2019 Even if you have to fake that enthusiasm it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s much harder for people to pressure you to drink if you\u2019re happy being alcohol-free.\u201d\n\nShare your experience with friends\n\nWhen undergoing such a potentially life-altering change, it is important to discuss what you are doing with friends and gain their support, according to Warrington. \u201cLet your friends know about your journey as that can be one of the most powerful means of encouragement,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when they see you\u2019re capable of it, they might decide to try it for themselves, too.\u201d", "description": "Staying alcohol-free at social events can be daunting, but be open to the new experience and own it", "authors": ["Ammar Kalia"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e583d3ab87869464228762e16f8693ea0b1f542/0_204_5315_3190/master/5315.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=384c6c607b4d0dcc9f7bd347de57093a"}
