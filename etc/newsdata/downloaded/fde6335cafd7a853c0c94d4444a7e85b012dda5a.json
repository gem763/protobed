He knows in hindsight that he has made a mistake.\u201d\n\nRodgers said questioning Maddison\u2019s attitude and character was grossly unfair as the 22-year-old had proved his worth on and off the pitch since joining Leicester last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen various stories about his arrogance, around his mentality, they\u2019re totally false,\u201d said the Foxes boss.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s desperate to play for England but doesn\u2019t feel entitled. It\u2019s really unfair, he\u2019s a really good boy, he\u2019s passionate, practices every day, and his dream is to represent England.\n\n\u201cHe knows by playing well for Leicester that\u2019s going to give him a great opportunity. Until that happens, he\u2019s going to fight.\u201d\n\nRodgers also offered support to striker Jamie Vardy, whose pregnant wife Rebekah was accused of leaking stories about former England team-mate Wayne Rooney\u2019s wife Coleen to The Sun in a Twitter spat.\n\nRebekah has denied the allegation but Rodgers said he had given his striker time off during the international break to take care of his personal matters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to support him, his family if they need, and I spoke to him earlier on in the week, he\u2019s trained fine, he\u2019s been great this week and that is where we\u2019re at,\u201d Rodgers added.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers launched an impassioned defence of James Maddison after the midfielder was pictured in a casino last week while England were losing a European Championship qualifier.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Liec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
