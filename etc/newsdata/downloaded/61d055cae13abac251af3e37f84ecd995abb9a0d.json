But he said \u201cthere will be no tariffs, there will be a single united customs union between all four nations of the UK.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit deal explained Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on 17 October 2019 - though it stills need approval from MPs and could face a narrow defeat. The 64-page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders' in a hybrid system: Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workers' rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

But it was slammed by Labour\u2019s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\n\nBoris Johnson began speaking in the Commons at 9.30am with the final vote expected this afternoon.", "description": "Nigel Dodds accused the Prime Minister of promising one thing and delivering another in an excoriating speech to the House of Commons", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Pru Afp Via Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652680.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
