The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said then that they died in what appeared to be suicide by gunfire.\n\nSurveillance video shows Deese and Fowler at a gas station two days before their bodies were found.\n\nRCMP Assistant Commissioner Kevin Hackett on Friday released details into the investigation. Police discovered a digital camera belonging to one of the victims. The suspects used it to make videos expressing their culpability, police said, and Hackett called them \"cold\" and \"remorseless.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Two teens who authorities say killed three people and were found dead after an extensive manhunt apparently shot and killed themselves, police in Canada said.", "authors": ["Carma Hassan", "Phil Gast"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190724074635-teen-suspects-canada-american-australian-dead-newton-newday-vpx-00005821-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
