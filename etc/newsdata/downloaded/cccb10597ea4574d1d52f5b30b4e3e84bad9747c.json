Activists across the country panicked, but as the Trump administration began its hectic reign, their outcry was largely ignored in the wake of other devastations. Now, two and a half years into president Trump\u2019s first term, they may feel their fears have been justified: Mr Trump has rolled back or attempted to roll back 85 environmental regulations, effectively dismantling the strides made by the Obama administration.\n\nThe changes were expected even before the website warning - Mr Trump has long disputed the existence of climate change, on one occasion suggesting it was a Chinese hoax. But the former real estate man also vowed during his candidacy to run the United States as he would a business. And that promise he\u2019s kept. Openly disdainful of the Environmental Protection Agency, Mr Trump has seen business opportunities in every part of the country, from air to endangered species to national parks.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

On Thursday, the Trump administration rolled back the 2015 Water of the United States (WOTUS) regulation, which enhanced protections by defining what bodies of water belong to, and are thus under care of, the US.\n\nClaiming that Obama-era rule costs \"hundred of thousands of jobs\" without any evidence to suggest it had, the administration has replaced the protection with a regulation that allows them to decide which waters deserve federal protection. Almost immediately after EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler announced the rule, the director of federal water policy at the Natural Resources Defence Council vowed to fight it in court.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The respect is mutual. In June, after issuing the Affordable Clean Energy rule, a major rollback of the Obama administration\u2019s climate plan that effectively extended a lifeline to the dying industry, Mr Wheeler said that the Trump administration is committed to ensuring that \u201ccoal plants will be a part of out clean future\u201d, which most climate scientists agree is impossible.\n\nAs with the WOTUS rule, health groups immediately filed a lawsuit against the EPA, following a consistent pattern with the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks. In cases like their diminishing of rules protecting people from asbestos, unclean water, pollution, or endangered species in general, environmental and public health groups have taken legal action as soon as possible.\n\nCaitlin McCoy, a climate, clean air, and energy fellow at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program who keeps track of the Trump administration rollbacks, says these lawsuits are kind of the point.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to transform our fundamental environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act by proposing new interpretations of the laws, through these new regulations, that dramatically limit EPA\u2019s authority, and the authority of states in some cases as well,\u201d she told The Independent. \u201cThey know these rules will be challenged in court and they are hoping that their interpretations will be upheld. If these interpretations are upheld by the courts, EPA will have far less authority to take action in these key areas related to climate change, public health, and the environment in the future.\u201d\n\nShe points to an upcoming rollback concerning auto pollution, which the auto industry itself has made clear they do not want. Mr Wheeler has also acknowledged that the final rules, once through the court battles, won\u2019t go as far as initially proposed. But the administration is still pushing forward with the rulemaking process, subjecting themselves to litigation and fights with the auto industry and state of California, to reduce only a small amount of the regulations they\u2019re against.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The current administration wants to significantly change the environmental legal landscape so that it would take revisions of the federal statutes themselves to restore EPA\u2019s authority in key areas.\u201d\n\nJonathan Levenshus, the director of federal campaigns for the Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign, pointed to an even more extreme proposed rollback as an example of the harm the administration seems willing to inflict in order to grab at future gains. Since 2018, the Trump administration has been trying to roll back the 2011 Mercury and Air Standards Rule, which limits hazardous pollution from coal-burning and oil-burning plants. Mr Levenshus called its rollback a \u201cdirect attack on women and children\u201d, claiming that it would have a disproportionate impact on lower-income families and people of colour.\n\n\u201cIt would save 11,000 people a year,\" Mr Levenshus said of the rule. \"The Trump administration is proposing we throw that out the window.\"\n\n\"I think they want to rewrite the entire process for conducting the way we determine the cost and benefit of our health standard,\u201d he continued. \"That move would invalidate the entire basis for Clean Air Act rules. Not only would Americans be less protected, but you\u2019d have blocked ways for the EPA to use these rules in the future. They\u2019re looking to rewrite the way we assess cost benefit analysis.\u201d\n\nHe notes that economically - that is, in the language this administration supposedly speaks - these rollbacks will do more harm than good.\n\n\u201cThe benefits are usually underestimated, and far greater from what EPA would calculate,\u201d he said, noting that prioritising public health leads to better education, longer lives, and healthier workers - all things that build a stronger economy.\n\nStill, Mr Levenshus says he\u2019s hopeful that this version of the EPA won\u2019t be as successful as the president imagines.\n\n\u201cThe record of the Trump administration and their efforts to weaken these standards are really no match for the law,\u201d he says. \u201cThey continue to roll out these dangerous rollbacks, but they\u2019re not winning. And I think that\u2019s an important part of this story.\u201d", "description": "In the first hour of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the newly appointed administration wiped Barack Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s climate and energy pages from the White House website, replacing them with the America First Energy Plan, which mostly focused on \u201cclean coal\u201d.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/22/gettyimages-1160847786.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
