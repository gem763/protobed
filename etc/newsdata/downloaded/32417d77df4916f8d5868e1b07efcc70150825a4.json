Yes, you read that right.", "language": "en", "text": "On Friday night, the current team will play its first World Series home game in franchise history against the Houston Astros. Seats are much pricier than $6.60. The modern-day ticket sharks on Stub Hub are demanding more than $1,000 for standing room only.\n\nLocal excitement was sky-high in 1933. At least two Senate hearings were postponed so senators and witnesses could attend the games, which were all played during the day. A local radio station arranged for a dozen men on death row at the D.C. jail to hear the games on the radio. The Gayety Theater announced a special burlesque show \u201cThe Pennant Winners,\u201d featuring \u201cthe Ladies of the Night\u201d ballet \u201cdancers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the first two games in New York, rookie president Franklin D. Roosevelt was poised to throw out the first ball in Washington. Cabinet members had reserved box seats at Griffith Stadium. Thousands of people entered The Post\u2019s \u201cunique baseball contest\u201d offering nine box seats to whomever could best pick the inning-to-inning outcome of the first game in New York\u2019s Polo Grounds against the National League champs New York Giants. The Senators \u2014 nicknamed the Nats \u2014 had won the American League pennant.\n\nThe Giants won that first game behind future Hall of Fame pitcher Carl Hubbell. Washington also lost the second game in New York, but that didn\u2019t dim hometown hopes. Upon returning to D.C. by train, the team was \u201cgreeted by throngs at Union Station last night like conquering heroes rather than like beaten\u201d losers, The Post reported.\n\n\u201cAtta, boy, Joe,\u201d the fans shouted to the Nats\u2019 26-year-old player/manager Joe Cronin, a shortstop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite a cool drizzle, 25,727 people turned out for the first game in Washington. Local dignitaries and members of the capital\u2019s high society stood out in the gathering. \u201cIt was all very much like a spectacle outside an ancient Roman arena where senator, statesman and military men forgot their dignities in the scuffle\u201d to \u201cwatch a contest between the world\u2019s most famous gladiators,\u201d The Post reported.\n\n\u201cA goodly gathering of smart women, as great fans as the men, added a note of color to the crowd,\u201d The Post said. \u201cSmart women in tweed and topcoats, in furs and orchids and women even smart in their raincoats.\u201d Watching the game was former president Woodrow Wilson\u2019s widow, Edith Galt Wilson, wearing \u201ca black suit with silver fox furs and her characteristic shoulder-bouquet of orchids.\u201d\n\nOn the field, a band played \u201cStormy Weather\u201d as the crowd waited for the skies to clear for the game. An Army band in bright blue-gray tunics and white trousers \u201cstrutted bravely and tunefully through the last of the drizzle,\u201d playing cheery music. The bands stood at attention as Roosevelt rode in his limousine up to the baseball diamond and then went to his seat.\n\nAfter the bands played \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d the president \u201cenergetically tossed out the ball.\u201d Nats outfielder Heinie Manush caught the ball but was too shy to take it to Roosevelt for an autograph. So a friendly policeman did it for him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGracie Allen of the comedy couple Burns and Allen, without her husband George Burns, sat with the newspaper reporters, telling them she was trying to find the press box for her brother. Told she was in the press box, Allen replied: \u201cThen I don\u2019t understand. He sent his trousers up an hour ago, and nobody has pressed them yet.\u201d\n\nThe umpire shouted \u201cPlay ball,\u201d and the game was on. Drawing about as much attention as the players was a pigeon pecking away in the infield despite efforts by the umpires to chase it away. New York Yankees slugger George Herman \u201cBabe\u201d Ruth, who was sitting high above the field in the press box, remarked, \u201cThere\u2019s one bird those umps can\u2019t run out of the game. They\u2019d have me in the shower bath by this time.\u201d\n\n(Roosevelt later met with Ruth at the White House. The president threw an arm around Ruth\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cBabe, I want to tell you a story.\u201d Roosevelt proceeded to tell about when he was running for vice president and arrived at a hotel in Binghamton, N.Y., to find a big, cheering crowd. \u201c\u2019This is a nice reception they\u2019ve given me,\u2019 I thought,\u201d Roosevelt said. Then he realized they were there to see Babe Ruth, and \u201cdidn\u2019t care to see me at all.\u201d The Babe grinned.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the first inning of the game, Roosevelt \u201cbounced up and down excitedly like a small boy\u201d when Washington\u2019s Fred Schulte doubled, driving in Goose Goslin, The Post reported. The Nats won 4 to 0 behind 22-game winner \u201chandsome\u201d Earl Whitehill, described by the New York Daily News as \u201ca dukey looking left-hander with a Hollywood kisser.\u201d\n\nControversy erupted in Game 4 when an umpire ejected Washington\u2019s Manush for arguing after being called out at first base. \u201cThe infuriated clamor of an outraged citizenry, crying for the lifeblood of an umpire, billowed out from the stands, swirling around the squat figure of Charley Moran, who had put Heinie out of the game for an unimportant gesture,\u201d The Post said.\n\nManush was the first player ever thrown out of a World Series game. The Nats lost 2 to 1 in 11 innings. After the game, the Associated Press reported, police escorted umpire Moran from the dressing room, \u201cdrove him under the grandstands in a car and did not leave him until he was safely on his way to a hotel.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFacing elimination, Washington was trailing 3 to 0 in the sixth inning of the fifth game when Schulte homered with two runners on base to tie the contest. \u201cFans were on their feet, hugging each other in ecstatic joy,\u201d The Post said. \u201cWashington players danced about like dervishes.\u201d\n\nBut there was no more joy in Nats-ville that day. Giants player/manager Mel Ott homered in the 10th inning to win the World Series for New York. Yet in the nation\u2019s capital, the gloom over the loss was countered by the rosy view that Washington would win many more pennants. \u201cMethinks the Nats are en route to better things,\u201d wrote Post sports columnist Shirley Lewis Povich.\n\nIt took 86 years to prove him right.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAD", "description": "In 1933, 'nattily attired ticket sharks' lined 14th Street peddling tickets for the World Series games in Washington.
