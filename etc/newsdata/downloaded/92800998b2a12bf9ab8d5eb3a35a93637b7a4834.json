'He's a great example to a lot of footballers out there if you lose your hunger. Spurs were carrying three of four players. He's lost that hunger, today non-existent.'\n\n'He needs to hear those words because I think he can take it', Neville responded. 'It's not like he's always had it on a plate, he's come from the lower leagues. But he's half the player [he was].'\n\nSouness concurred, saying: 'I thought he was going to be a star. I think he's a classic case of someone who's in his armchair. They gave him a four/five year contract, and look what's happened. He's taken his eye off the ball but he's a shadow of himself. Got to learn the game.'\n\nCarragher also feels a change in position has had a negative impact on Alii's career.\n\nAlli struggled to have an impact in the game as his side suffered another defeat\n\n'When he was at his best he was playing as a second striker. I've never seen Dele Alli as some great player on the ball. He got goals. We shouldn't forget the position he was playing. He's still got to do a lot more. He was about being aggressive a lot.'\n\n'A lot of that comes down to desire,' Keane added. 'He was nasty, played on the edge. Today, non-existent for a year or two. Unless you've got the hunger. If he's a model of some sort, he does have to look in the mirror\u2026'\n\nNeville put the final nail in the coffin, stating: 'He would always tackle, always work hard, run past the striker\u2026 today he was passive. He's a good kid. I just thought it epitomised where Tottenham have been.'", "description": "Gary Neville and Roy Keane believe Dele Alli's performance against Liverpool on Sunday was further proof that the midfielder has regressed significantly as a player.", "authors": ["Spencer Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20255826-0-image-a-2_1572210917740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
