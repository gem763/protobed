Before you head down a path of deep cuts in defense, why don\u2019t you take it kind of slow,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cYou know it was one of those things where I lost the argument.\u201d\n\nFox also spoke with former Gen. Michael Flynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the United States of America is in a less strong position today because of the readiness and the size of our armed forces,\u201d Flynn said.\n\n\u201cI think he sees the military actually as something that is more dangerous to the world,\u201d Flynn added. \u201cI think that he looks at the United States military and sees it as a threatening application around the world, than actually as a useful tool.\u201d", "description": "Robert Gates said Obama broke a promise about budget cuts to the Pentagon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/robertgatesgn.jpg", "published_at": "2016-04-02"}
