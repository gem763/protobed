One year before, on the anniversary of the vote, police estimated 180,000 marched in the coastal city, while activists stopped traffic on highways and blocked train lines.\n\nTuesday's referendum anniversary protests took place amid a strong police presence, especially in train stations and on highways, but there were no transit problems due to protesters reported.\n\nIn the town of Girona near the French border, some activists threw eggs filled with red paint at riot police and overturned large trash containers. Marchers holding smoke torches shouted \"Out with the occupying forces!\" at the gates of the city's Civil Guard barracks, before moving to the Spanish government's provincial delegation to stage a sit-in.\n\nPolls and recent elections show that the 5.5 million voters of Catalonia are roughly evenly split on the independence issue. Those who don't want to sever century-old ties with Spain stayed away from the demonstrations.\n\nThe sensitive anniversary comes as Spain's Supreme Court is set to rule on a rebellion and sedition trial against a dozen Catalan politicians and activists who were key protagonists in Catalonia's Oct. 1, 2017, independence referendum.\n\nAny ruling that doesn't absolve the defendants will be considered \"unfair,\" grassroots pro-secession civil society groups announced Tuesday, calling for protests and \"peaceful civil disobedience\" if the court rules otherwise.\n\nThe arrests last week of seven pro-independence activists who face possible terrorism charges have also angered many separatists in Catalonia, who liken the crackdown to an attempt by Spanish authorities to criminalize their political independence movement.\n\nAlthough the judicial probe is sealed by Spain's National Court, which typically has jurisdiction over terrorism-related cases, details of the interrogations of the activists have been leaked to Spanish media.\n\nThey largely paint a picture of a secretive, organized group who allegedly prepared explosives to wreak havoc in communications and key infrastructure and planned to occupy the regional Catalan parliament in Barcelona in response to the upcoming Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nSome of the publications linked their activities to the region's current and former separatist leaders. Carles Puigdemont, the ousted Catalan president who Spain considers a fugitive, denied any links to the activists during an interview Tuesday with Catalan radio in Belgium, where he fled in 2017 after the failed independence bid.\n\n\"They are trying to push a narrative to accuse me of terrorism,\" he said.\n\nPro-union politicians and newspaper editorials have criticized separatist leaders for not condemning the activists' alleged plans. In a speech Tuesday, Puigdemont's successor Quim Torra, the current regional president, said his Cabinet remained focused on establishing a Catalan Republic \"without excuses,\" and to do it \"democratically and peacefully.\"\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who has been in a caretaker capacity since February and faces a repeated general election next month, delivered a stern warning Tuesday to the separatists. If regional separatist leaders break Spanish laws again, he told Cadena Ser radio, central authorities wouldn't hesitate to suspend the region's self-government and apply direct rule again, like they did temporarily two years ago after the divisive independence attempt.\n\n\"That's why I'm asking separatists not to play with fire. They need to condemn any violent activity,\" S\u00e1nchez said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Joseph Wilson reported this story in Barcelona and AP writer Aritz Parra reported from Madrid.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
