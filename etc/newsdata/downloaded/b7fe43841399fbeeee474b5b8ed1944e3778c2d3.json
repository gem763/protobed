Its black box has been found.\n\nNearly 500 passengers and crew were rescued.\n\nMost were winched into helicopters from the upper deck of the ship as the blaze raged below, but dozens may still be missing, possibly including illegal migrants not listed on the ship\u2019s manifest, Italian\n\nofficials have said.\n\nReports of those missing have varied from 10 to 98.\n\nIn his end-of-year address, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi praised the rescue effort and complimented the ship\u2019s captain, Argilio Giacomazzi, for staying on board until the ship was fully evacuated.\n\nBut several rescued passengers have criticised the handling of the emergency.\n\nLeonidas Constantinidis, a Greek lorry driver with a bandaged arm and apparent burn marks on his face, told Reuters he had jumped overboard to save himself and was picked up by a nearby merchant ship.\n\n\u201cWhere I was I did not hear any siren, any alarm. Nothing seemed to work, the fire sprinklers, the fire extinguishers, nothing was working,\u201d Constantinidis said.\n\nIt is unclear what went wrong but judicial sources have said six people \u2013 the captain, three crew members, the ship\u2019s operator and its owner \u2013 are under investigation for multiple manslaughter and causing a disaster.", "description": "Investigators hope to establish what went wrong and how many died in a fatal fire on a car ferry travelling from Patras in Greece to Ancona in Italy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/294278/1000x563_294278.jpg", "published_at": "2015-01-02"}
