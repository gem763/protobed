The amount spent on buybacks year-to-date is down 17% year-over-year, although it is on track to be \"the second highest total on record.\"\n\nGoldman anticipates that this trend will continue, noting that \"early indications suggest second-quarter weakness in buybacks may persist.\"\n\nFor 2019 the firm predicts that total buybacks will drop 15% to $710 billion, and in 2020 they see another 5% decline to $675 billion.\n\nShare repurchases have been a key element during this bull market, which is currently the longest on record. By repurchasing shares, a company reduces the number of shares outstanding. It can have the effect of boosting the stock price and also lifts earnings per share figures.\n\nIt's a frequent, but not always popular, move for companies. Some argue that instead of practicing buybacks companies should invest more in capex, for instance. And Washington is taking note. The House Financial Services Committee, for instance, is currently looking at ways to potentially reform buyback spending laws.", "description": "Companies are reining in their spending, especially when it comes to buybacks, and it could have a big impact on the direction of stocks.", "authors": ["Pippa Stevens"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104412780-RTS12N97.jpg?v=1566562356", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
