It\u2019s something I\u2019m reading about, just like everybody is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to comment further than that.\u201d\n\nThe NBA coach\u2019s silence comes in the wake of the league\u2019s decision to apologize to Beijing for a \u201cFight for Freedom\u201d tweet by Rockets general manager Daryl Morey.\n\n\u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,\u201d NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said in a statement released Monday. \u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nMr. Kerr\u2019s silence stunned the reporters so much that their reaction elicited another response from him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not used to me saying that, are you? No comment,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cYou\u2019re all stunned.\u201d\n\nStunned, no. Surprised? Somewhat,\u201d responded NBC Sports reporter Monte Poole on Tuesday. \u201cHe urges Americans to vote. He believes President Trump is an aspiring dictator. The bullseye in Kerr\u2019s circle of social concern is his staunch advocacy for national gun control, a stance formed from personal tragedy. \u2026 This is the real bag of vipers \u2026 the financial partnership between the NBA and China. Or, should we say, the powers that be in China.\u201d\n\nSteve Kerr didn\u2019t have much to say on the on the Daryl Morey-China situation. Called it \u201cbizarre\u201d pic.twitter.com/onoBJjrDdI \u2014 Logan Murdock (@loganmmurdock) October 8, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
