(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA Starbucks customer with a nut allergy has filed a $10,000 lawsuit against the company for allegedly serving him almond milk, causing an allergic reaction.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Monday complaint filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court and sent to Yahoo Lifestyle by Oregon law firm OlsenDaines, Max Scher visited the Jantzen Beach Starbucks in Portland back in May and ordered a coffee with soy milk. Instead, the claim states, the beverage contained almond milk.\n\nScher declined to comment further to Yahoo Lifestyle, however he confirmed that he is allergic to all types of nuts. He also told The Oregonian that he always tells employees, \u201cHey, I have an allergy. Please be careful.\u201d\n\nThe allergic reaction began almost immediately. \u201cI had three sips before my reaction started, and that\u2019s way too much to have in my system,\u201d Scher told The Oregonian.\n\nThe outlet reports that Scher\u2019s throat began to itch so he ingested Benadryl and gave himself an EpiPen injection, medication that he always keeps with him, then drove himself to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center in Portland, where he vomited. Scher says that his medical expenses total $4,000 and he wants Starbucks to pay the bill. He is suing the coffee company for negligence and unlawful trade practices.\n\n\u201cThey poisoned him,\u201d Scher\u2019s attorney Michael Fuller tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nUnder the claim of negligence, the attorney argues that by selling coffee, it is Starbucks\u2019 responsibility to use \u201creasonable care\u201d and that employees should have known that failure to do so could cause allergic reactions \u201cresulting in serious injury or death.\u201d\n\n\u201c...As a result of Starbucks\u2019s negligence, plaintiff had a serious allergic reaction, requiring hospitalization, incurred over $4,000 in medical bills, and experienced pain, discomfort, and interference with daily life activities,\u201d read the claim.\n\nThe unlawful trade practices of the claim states that \u201cStarbucks knew or should have known that the law protects consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices, and Starbucks knew or should have known that the coffee it advertised to plaintiff as containing soy milk actually contained almond milk.\u201d\n\nScher has requested a jury trial.\n\nA Starbucks representative tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cOur partners (employees) take great care in ensuring each one of our customers\u2019 beverages are customized as ordered. We take allegations like this seriously and are thoroughly investigating this situation.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The customer had an allergic reaction to almond milk, sending him to the hospital.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XFjihBoTBhgaqkNQHwgSBw--~B/aD0zNDQwO3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/568e2e60-e796-11e9-9bfb-3293e5557d9b", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
