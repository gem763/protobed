Late yesterday, it touched a session high of $10,297.12 but failed to extend its profits as investors explored opportunities in risk-on assets. More specifically, they waited for the European Central Bank to deliver an economic easing package, as its president Mario Draghi takes the stage to publicize his monetary policy decisions.\n\nNote: As of this time of writing, ECB has announced that it is cutting deposit rates from -0.5 to -0.4. It is also introducing a 20 billion economic easing package. Bitcoin is up by $50.\n\nBreaking News\n\nDraghi goes out with mini-bang as ECB goes back to its toolbox and pulls out quantitative easing just nine months after ending the program. +20 billion Euro QE for as long as needed\n\n+Deposit rates -0.5 from -0.4 some were looking for even more draconian moves \u2014 Charles V Payne (@cvpayne) September 12, 2019\n\nInvestors Go After Risk-on Assets\n\nA broad consensus of economists shows that ECB could push their interest rates into negative territory. They also see a new monetary easing of the sovereign and non-financial corporate bond purchases on the horizon. The move could eventually weaken the Euro, sparking a parallel trade war with the US, especially when Trump has threatened to slap extra tariffs on German automobiles and French wine.\n\nEuropean Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports\u2026. And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019\n\nThe US president is, nevertheless, appearing softer on the trade war he is already fighting with China. He delayed an increase in tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods by 15 days. His decision came after Beijing suspended tariffs on some US imports, signaling the first signs of trade resolve before the two sides meet in October for further negotiations.\n\nGlobal stocks gain w/Asia equities hit 6week high on goodwill trade gestures and on hopes that the ECB would kick off another wave on monetary easing.
