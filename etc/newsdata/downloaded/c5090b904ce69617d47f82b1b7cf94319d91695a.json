That contrasts with the recent trend toward budgets that are roughly flat, most recently slipping to 10.5% of company revenue this year from 11.2% in 2018, Gartner found.\n\nAnd 86% of respondents said the political and economic environment would have a positive impact on their business results in the next 18 to 24 months, according to Gartner. The research and advisory firm surveyed 342 marketers in North America and the U.K. at companies with $500 million or more in revenue.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nConsumers slowed spending and businesses cut back in August, meanwhile, as economic warning signs accumulate.\n\nMarketers seem to be isolating themselves from broader concerns, said Ewan McIntyre, a vice president and analyst at Gartner. \u201cI speak to you from the U.K., where we have a huge amount of uncertainty around what\u2019s going to happen around Brexit, and that of course is not isolated to the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the impact of trade tariffs and just generally the uncertainty in the wider business context.\u201d\n\nBut Lone Thomsen, a former Coca-Cola Co. executive who\u2019s now global chief marketing officer at Meatless Farm Co. in the U.K., said marketers may be justified.\n\nThe prolonged Brexit process has probably made some marketers hold back a bit, Ms. Thomsen allowed. \u201cBut I think that will pick up again as soon as this thing has been settled,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd marketers in general have a case for greater budgets because they need to invest in new capabilities including marketing technology, Ms. Thomsen said.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. are distinct cases, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at WPP PLC\u2019s media-agency conglomerate GroupM. \u201cIn the U.S., it feels like there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s stopping growth from happening in the short term,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s all sort of risks, but from a planning perspective growth continues.\u201d\n\nIn the U.K., it\u2019s not clear whether and when Brexit questions will clear up, he said. \u201cThe U.K. is just on the edge of who knows what,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nFlexibility is key when uncertainty dominates, another executive said.\n\nDawn Morris, chief digital banking and marketing officer at First Horizon National Corp. and a respondent in the Gartner survey, said she expects her marketing budget to remain steady next year\u2014to start. If conditions get worse, or if new opportunities arise, the company will adapt, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are putting in place much more of an agile marketing capability than we have right now,\u201d Ms. Morris said.\n\nWrite to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com", "description": "Nearly 90% of marketing executives believe the political and economic environment will benefit their businesses in the next 18 to 24 months, according to a new Gartner survey.", "authors": ["Nat Ives", "Nat.Ives Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-112347/social", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
