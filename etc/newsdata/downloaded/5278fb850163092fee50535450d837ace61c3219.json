It\u2019s becoming routine: the spewing of left-wing talking points, the bashing of Trump, the occasional knifing of one candidate by another\u2014rinse and repeat. Joe Biden was actually aggressive in the first half; Julian Castro also delivered some zings at Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Yet, Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke decided to go all-in on desperation tactics, where he blamed President Donald Trump for the El Paso shooting. Bob has really tried to corner the \u2018woke\u2019 vote, saying not only this but also declaring that we have a white supremacist in the White House. Soy boy, Bob took it to another level when he said that the El Paso shooter was inspired to kill by Trump. That is a total lie. CNS News clipped and transcribed this insanity:\n\nThe first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is - the cost and the consequence of his presidency. A racism and violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon who should never have been able to buy in the first place - inspired to kill by our president. \u201cThe second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of mole hills. We have to be bigger. We have to see clearly, we have to speak honestly and we have to act decisively. That's what I want to do for you as president of the United States. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe El Paso shooter was a white supremacist, but what\u2019s also glossed over is the fact that he hated Republicans and killing people to return Earth of a level of sustainability was also a huge factor in his sloppy manifesto. That\u2019s eco-terrorism, something that\u2019s very much associated with the Left. Bob probably knows this, but disregarded it to take a cheap shot at Trump because his campaign isn\u2019t going anywhere, or he doesn\u2019t know this because he\u2019s an idiot.", "description": ".09/13/2019 15:20:29PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/7ce64a24-268e-4aae-b1e6-70079a6b628f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
