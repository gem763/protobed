Traditional hunting, while lawful, should not allow gratuitous or prolonged pain and cruelty.'\n\nWirangu-Kokatha elder Jack Johncock has stepped in to defend the officer on Thursday evening.\n\n'For the people of the west coast of South Australia, the wombat is a big part of their diet and they'll get wombat any way they can,' he told the ABC.\n\nHorrific footage went viral of police officer Waylon Johncock (pictured) repeatedly throwing rocks at the wombat's head at South Australia's Eyre Peninsula\n\nThe video was taken on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, showing the off-duty officer repeatedly throwing rocks at the wombat's head while being encouraged by a friend\n\nHe said a petition to make killing with rocks illegal showed a 'lack of understanding of cultural practices'.\n\n'Don't they think they've done enough changes in this country to take away all our rights and customs?' he said.\n\n'I think enough is enough.'\n\nJack said that people should not judge something that has been part of his culture for thousands of years.\n\nWaylon has been in the South Australian Police Force for ten years working as one of the state's 36 Community Liaison Officers.\n\nHe is now a Senior Community Constable based in the remote Nullabor region near the border with West Australia.\n\nVideo of the attack shows the wombat waddling along the road as two men in a car follow, before Waylon steps out of the car wearing only shorts and shoes.\n\nHe starts chasing the animal before the man behind the wheel tells him to 'get up close'.\n\nMr Sumner (pictured) said if Johncock was indeed hunting the wombat then it would be done in a more humane way\n\nNgarrindjeri elder Major Sumner (pictured) said the officer's shocking cruel actions in stoning the gentle animal was 'wrong'\n\nWaylon is seen picking up a large rock and viciously throws it at the wombat's head as both men laugh.\n\nThe wombat starts running in an attempt to get away from the men before they both chase after him.\n\n'You've got him, you've got him, hit him, hit him,' the man in the car can be heard saying as Waylon picks up another rock.\n\n'Kill him!'\n\nAs the man behind the wheel speeds up to keep the headlights shining on him, Waylon gives a final blow causing it to topple over.\n\n'Yeah! You did it!' the man in the car says.\n\n'First man I've ever seen kill a wombat on foot, bro.'\n\nNgarrindjeri elder Major Sumner said the officer's shockingly cruel actions in stoning the gentle animal were 'wrong'.\n\n'We didn't hunt like that. We still don't hunt like that,' the 71-year-old told The Advertiser.\n\nMr Sumner said if Waylon was indeed hunting the wombat then it would be done in a more humane way.\n\n'If they're saying it was hunting for food, you wouldn't go and hunt a sheep like that (and) you wouldn't go and hunt any cattle like that,' he said.\n\n'That animal would be bruised up (and) it wouldn't be good for you to cook or eat or anything.\n\n'If you want to hunt something for food, it's done in the most humane way and end their life straight away \u2013 it's not a fun game for you.'\n\nAnimal welfare organisation PETA also issued a statement on the incident on Friday morning.\n\n'A police officer who smiles as he pelts a living, feeling being to death should not only be struck off the force but also be locked up,' spokeswoman Emily Rice said.\n\n'We must treat all acts of violence with the seriousness that they deserve. Otherwise, we risk endangering the lives of both animals and humans.'\n\nOnce the wombat falls over, both men are heard laughing as the off-duty police officer stands up triumphant", "description": "Almost 230,000 people have signed an online petition calling for a review of Aboriginal hunting law after video of an officer stoning a wombat to death in South Australia went viral on Thursday.", "authors": ["Aidan Wondracz", "Sahar Mourad For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/01/19320542-0-image-a-5_1570235301986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
