REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nLOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Joaquin Phoenix is king of the North American box office once again as \u201cJoker\u201d scores an easy victory in its second weekend with $55 million at 4,374 sites.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d dominated a trio of new entries with animated comedy \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d leading the rest of pack with $30.3 million at 4,007 venues, topping forecasts. Will Smith\u2019s \u201cGemini Man\u201d wound up under expectations with $20.5 million at 3,642 locations. Adam DeVine\u2019s artificial intelligence comedy \u201cJexi\u201d generated little interest with $3.1 million at 2,332 screens.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d showed plenty of traction, declining only 43% from its impressive opening of $96.2 million, the fifth-largest domestic launch of 2019 despite worries about the negative impact of the film\u2019s darker themes. Moviegoers have stayed strongly engaged with a 10-day total of more than $192 million.\n\nThe psychological thriller has already become hugely profitable for Warner Bros., which partnered with Village Roadshow and Bron on the $55 million project. And with a solid international performance of $351 million, \u201cJoker\u201d has hit $543 million at the worldwide box office in less than two weeks.\n\n\u201cThe Addams Family,\u201d handled through MGM\u2019s United Artists Releasing, had been projected to earn $21 million to $27 million. The PG film, which has been marketed toward family audiences, follows Morticia, Gomez, Wednesday, Pugsley and Uncle Fester as they bring their love of the macabre to 21st century life in New Jersey.\n\nPre-release forecasts had placed \u201cGemini Man\u201d between $24 million and $29 million, but competition from \u201cJoker\u201d plus downbeat reviews \u2014 the film currently sits at 26% on Rotten Tomatoes \u2014 yielded a disappointing result, given the $138 million price tag for Paramount, Skydance Media, Fosun and Alibaba. The film follows Will Smith who battles a younger clone of himself, which director Ang Lee achieved through hyperrealistic visuals.\n\n\u201cJexi\u201d opened at the lower end of modest expectations. Adam DeVine stars as a man addicted to his phone, whose life changes thanks to a digital life coach named Jexi. The movie is the last theatrical release by CBS Films before it\u2019s absorbed into CBS Corporation\u2019s Entertainment Group.\n\nThe top two films continue the recent trend of solid overall performances in North America, according to Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with Comscore.\n\n\u201c\u2018Joker\u2019 continues to enthrall audiences, spark conversation and generate interest as reflected by a very modest drop of 43% in its second weekend,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018The Addams Family\u2019 found favor with family audiences that were excited by the Halloween season friendly and nostalgia generating animated film.\u201d", "description": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Joaquin Phoenix is king of the North American box office once again as \"Joker\" scores an easy victory in its second weekend with $55 million at 4,374 sites.", "authors": ["Dave Mcnary", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440413321&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0I3-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
