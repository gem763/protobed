The extra six months would \"give room\" for resolving issues, he added.\n\nMore:\n\nSpeaking later at a public event, President Salva Kiir did not directly address the comments from Machar's camp.\n\nKiir said all parties to the agreement had committed to forming the unity government on November 12 and the international community expected that to happen.\n\n\"I want to welcome (the opposition) and forget all the bitterness,\" Kiir said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from other countries who helped broker the accord.\n\nUS officials said this month they would not accept more delays and might impose sanctions if deadlines are not met.\n\nAl Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, reporting from neighbouring Sudan said external mediators might have to intervene if the deadline is to be met.\n\n\"Machar is saying the security arrangement which were included in the peace deal that was signed in Khartoum are not yet in place. According to that agreement 83,000 troops from all sides are supposed to be merged together to form a unified army,\" Morgan said from the capital, Khartoum.\n\n\"IGAD, the regional body, is saying it is up to the mediators to decide whether there should be another extension to the deal. The mediators were Uganda and Sudan. Officials in Khartoum have told us they are speaking to Kiir on the latest development,\" she added.\n\nSouth Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, then plunged into its own conflict at the end of 2013 when Kiir had a fallout with Machar, his then vice president.\n\nTroops loyal to both men clashed in the capital Juba that December and ethnically charged fighting spread, shutting down oil fields, forcing a third of the country's population from their homes and killing more than 400,000 people.\n\nThe peace deal has stopped the fighting. But South Sudan's government has said it does not have the finances to fund disarmament and the integration of rebels into the army.\n\nSo far, it has allocated $10m of the pledged $100m, according to the international body monitoring the ceasefire.\n\nBoth sides have also disagreed on details of the deal, including the number of states South Sudan should have. Under the accord, they have agreed to hold elections after a transition period of three years.\n\nA UN Security Council delegation visited Juba earlier this month in an attempt to persuade the two sides to solve their remaining disputes over the pact.\n\nIt is unlikely that fighting will resume after the missed deadline, said Alan Boswell, a senior analyst with Brussels-based think-tank International Crisis Group.\n\nThis is largely because most of the international community is now urging both sides to agree on a new road map by the deadline in order to salvage the deal, he said.", "description": "South Sudan's government is failing to push through a peace deal, the country's main opposition says, calling for a six-month delay in the formation of a unity administration.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8173/34fef0fdd92f46ef9050dd5ece7d01e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
