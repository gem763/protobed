Because the debt was trading for 115 cents on the dollar, the prices swiftly dropped by more than 10% after the airport announced last month that it was terminating a $1.8 billion contract with the consortium to renovate the main terminal and operate retail concessions for three decades.\n\nIt follows an instance last year when for-profit health system HCA Healthcare Inc. bought Mission Health System, an Asheville, North Carolina-based non-profit, triggering a par call on Mission\u2019s premium bonds. The losses imposed by Denver Great Hall and Mission could cause buyers to shun new deals with similar provisions.\n\n\u201cThis should be a wake-up call for the industry,\u201d said Fred Cohen, former director of municipal bond trading at AllianceBernstein Holding LP. \u201cBuyers haven\u2019t focused on it because it hasn\u2019t happened that often, but it happens every once in a while and investors pay the price.\u201d\n\nThe steep price drop illustrates a rarely seen risk in the $3.8 trillion municipal-bond market that\u2019s grown as tumbling interest rates push prices of many securities well above face value. Since many investors still want debt that carry 5% coupons because it\u2019s the easiest to resell, more than 70% of the $232 billion of municipal bonds issued this year have been sold at a premium, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors should demand that borrowers issuing new premium bonds agree to pay the amortized cost of the debt, reflecting how much money they\u2019ve lent to the issuer, rather than par in the event of an extraordinary redemption, Cohen said.\n\nDisappointed\n\nDenver officials in August notified the partnership that includes Ferrovial Airports International Ltd, Saunders Construction Inc. and JLC Infrastructure, that it was terminating the development agreement for the Great Hall Project in the airport\u2019s Jeppesen Terminal, which had been beset by delays and cost overruns.\n\nNuveen LLC held about $20 million of the Great Hall bonds as of July 31. John Miller, who oversees more than $150 billion state and local government bonds as head of municipal investments, said the firm was disappointed at Denver International Airport\u2019s decision to terminate the agreement.\n\nThe action \u201cwill result in bondholders being damaged and the equity participant possibly benefiting from a make whole equity call. It is unknown how much the developer will be paid to go away as a result of the termination payment, meanwhile, bondholders may be offered par,\u201d Miller said in an email. \u201cDIA believes the best course of action is to take over as developer because the project has experienced significant delays and cost overruns. While the majority of bondholders have supported DIA deals in the past, its purported course of action is not a viable solution for bondholders as this action would hurt long-term investors in the airport.\u201d\n\nAdam Banker, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments, which owned about $20 million of the bonds at the end of July, said the company doesn\u2019t comment on specific holdings.\n\nThe decision to terminate the contract was in the best interest of the airport, passengers and the airport\u2019s investors, said Stacey Stegman, an airport spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that these are not the city\u2019s or airport\u2019s bonds,\" Stegman wrote in an email. \"In the case of termination, a \u2018termination for convenience\u2019 placed Great Hall Partners\u2019 bondholders/accredited investors in the best position.\"\n\nThe city will make a termination payment to Great Hall Partners and the Public Finance Authority which issued the debt and it will be their responsibility to pay bondholders, she said.\n\nPrices on the biggest maturity of the bonds, a $132 million block maturing in 2049, dropped to 104 cents on the dollar from 115 cents the day before. The partnership issued the maturity in December 2017 at 113 cents on the dollar. As of mid August the amortized cost of $132 million Denver Great Hall bonds maturing in 2049 was about 111 cents on the dollar or $147 million.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Denver International Airport\u2019s decision to terminate a contract with private developers to build a \u201cGreat Hall\u201d at one of its terminals is proving costly to investors who bought about $190 million municipal bonds to help finance the project.The securities were sold at a premium and borrowing", "authors": ["Martin Z.
