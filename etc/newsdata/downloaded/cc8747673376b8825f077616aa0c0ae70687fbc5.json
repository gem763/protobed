That decision lead judging and hosting personnel to repeatedly refer to the duo\u2019s house as a \u201cparty\u201d house; comments which Mitch and Mark repeatedly took exception to.\n\nDuring last night\u2019s room reveal episode, they finally reached their breaking point.\n\nWhen Scott Cam pointed out that another couple\u2019s second master suite was a masterstroke \u201cto get away from the noisy people\u201d in Mitch & Mark\u2019s house, McKie clearly had had enough, delivering a searing rebuttal to both Cam and the judges that very heavily implied they were only receiving that commentary because of their sexuality.\n\n\u201cPeople need to realise there are multiple living spaces in all metropolitan homes and they need to step away from it.\u201d \u201cIt is a living space as any house in any part of suburbia has. And if they\u2019re making a judgment about us \u2014 because they\u2019ve often said, \u2018People like us\u2019 \u2014 I need to understand what does that mean? Are you judging us?\u201d\n\nCam, ever the deft operator, fired back gruffly \u201cI don\u2019t need to step away from nothing, mate. I\u2019m the one reading the feedback.\u201d\n\nThe entire scene fired up viewers of social media, very few \u2013 if any \u2013 of whom sat on the side of the production.\n\nI think @TheBlock might want to rethink airing those repeated comments about Mitch and Mark. People on #twitter are squarely in their corner \u2013 proud of them for standing up against the stereotype #TheBlock \u2014 Matthew Newman (@mattnewman_au) September 8, 2019\n\nThe blatant homophobia on The Block is getting a little too much and a little too frequent. Quite disappointing. #theblock #theblockAU pic.twitter.com/evxrcYZhL0 \u2014 Troy Lester (@TroyLester) September 8, 2019\n\nGo Mitch and Mark. Stand up to that nonsense. It has connotations. It isn't funny. Complicit. It implies a lot #TheBlock \u2014 Rue (@Rudoxxx) September 8, 2019\n\nGood on Mitch & Mark calling out the homophobia on #TheBlock & @ScottyCam9 \u2014 Sasha Cunningham (@sashac) September 8, 2019\n\n#TheBlock The thing people don\u2019t understand is that when someone says people like you to an LGBTQ+ person we take it with negative connotations; whether it is meant that way or not. M+M are allowed to feel the way they do because that is what society has taught us. \u2014 Jake DC \u2013 Hellfire TC Ambassador (@JDChen0804) September 8, 2019\n\nScotty went from \u2018I added that in, just winding you blokes up\u2019 to \u2018don\u2019t have a go at me, I\u2019m just reading the feedback\u2019 pretty quick #TheBlock \u2014 AndyNeths (@Andyneths) September 8, 2019\n\n#TheBlock will be interesting in seeing how they deal with an issue of homophobia. The boys are in every right to be offended with the \"you kind of people\" statement.\n\nIt's happened since the floorplan change by the boys. \u2014 Kris (@GoldenClancy) September 8, 2019\n\nIf Mitch and Mark were any other couple on #theblock, that room would be described as a \u2018parents retreat\u2019 or living area. Let\u2019s all move on. It\u2019s a room with a couch. #TheBlockAU \u2014 Loren (@leapinloren) September 8, 2019\n\nFollowing that tense confrontation, Mitch & Mark appeared in talking heads mentioning that they would \u201crather just leave it there.\u201d Worryingly though, the series appears to be anchoring the coming week\u2019s programming around the issue, even going so far as to heavily promote tonight\u2019s episode as the one where \u201cScotty walks out.\u201d\n\nTV's biggest week of drama starts tonight 7.30pm! ???? #TheBlock pic.twitter.com/suiqNbV19r \u2014 The Block (@TheBlock) September 8, 2019\n\nNothing to do with the fact that this perfectly competent couple has been subjected to weeks of snippy commentary, coupled with a show edit practically obsessed with playing Disco Inferno as often as it bloody well can when they\u2019re on screen.\n\nNo, it\u2019s the host \u2013 Scott Fucking Cam \u2013 who is \u201coffended\u201d over all of this. Good gear.\n\nUnfortunately, this one looks to be getting much, much worse before it tries to get any better.", "description": "Last night's episode of The Block saw a simmering homophobia issue finally boil to the surface, after Mitch & Mark took exception to crook judge's comments.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/08/the-block.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
