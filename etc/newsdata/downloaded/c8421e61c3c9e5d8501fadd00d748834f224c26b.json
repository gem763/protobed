The shipping giant \u2013 which derives about one-third of its annual revenue from international sources \u2013 missed on both the top and bottom lines, and lowered its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance in part due to a \u201cweakening global macro environment driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBut the U.S. consumer, as Smith puts it, is still robust. Consumer spending, which comprises about 70% of domestic economic activity, jumped 4.7% in the second quarter this year, the fastest pace of gains since 2014, which helped keep quarterly U.S. GDP at 2.0% despite drags from trade-related factors like declining exports and lower inventory builds.\n\nFedEx has been one of the more visible \u2013 and vocal \u2013 corporate casualties of the U.S.-China trade war and related bifurcation of the domestic and global economies that has come as a result, with services sectors broadly outperforming their manufacturing counterparts.\n\nAlthough U.S. industrial production picked up in August after a July decline, global manufacturing PMIs remain in negative territory. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, has seen activity in its manufacturing sector activity plunge and hold near a seven-year low.\n\n\u201cAnd the U.S. consumer, which is a remarkable driver of growth and employment \u2013 all things that are spoken about every day \u2013 sort of mask the fact that the goods producing sector, which we\u2019re in the midst of, is much more global in nature than the U.S. consumer, which is largely services and certain consumption,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo that\u2019s the reason that we began the year the way we began it.\u201d\n\nHONG KONG, CHINA - 2019/05/13: A FedEx Corp delivery truck seen parked on the streets of Hong Kong.

But its persistent woes have become an exemplum of the struggles companies face to shift their business models against a backdrop of volatile trade policies and macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\n\u201cOur international operations are much more sensitive to changes in global trade than our U.S. domestic operations because of the higher concentration of business-to-business shipments internationally,\u201d FedEx said in an SEC filing Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe softer economic outlook is expected to create an ongoing revenue shortfall from planned levels, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific,\u201d the company added. \u201cThe cost of maintaining two separate networks in Europe while we execute the TNT Express integration is expected to compound the impact of the revenue shortfall on our near-term results.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, FedEx has taken steps to try and mitigate the impact to business as a result of these factors \u2013 namely, by passing on some costs to the consumer. FedEx earlier Tuesday announced it would be increasing rates on a host of consumer shipping services starting in January 2020, including an average of 4.9% price increase for U.S. express, ground and home delivery services, along with an average 5.9% increase to FedEx Freight rates.", "description": "Surging consumer spending has kept the U.S. economy afloat \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t been enough to buoy the financial results for FedEx.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7Xx7O_6Bjh7_XrAgXXAw0Q--~B/aD0zMjgzO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/1c8a0b20-8608-11e9-bfff-dcd4c2f409c7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
