I\u2019m referring to the next recession.\n\nSometimes it is framed as a question, but often it\u2019s delivered as a statement of fact \u2014 i.e. we\u2019re heading into recession. I\u2019m sympathetic to both because the current cycle has been a long one and there are increasing signs of a slowdown.\n\nBut whether it\u2019s next week, next year or beyond, we need to remember that a recession\u2019s relationship to investing is a complicated one. Here\u2019s what I mean.\n\nWhen, not if\n\nFirst, we will have a recession. Predicting when, however, is difficult, if not impossible.\n\nFor instance, I\u2019ve been anticipating a slowdown for a few years, but non-stop stimulation by governments and central banks has kept the economy growing. How long they can keep using one credit card to pay off another is anyone\u2019s guess, but we shouldn\u2019t underestimate their resolve. Even if near-zero interest rates are losing their impact, there\u2019s still room for an increase in government spending.\n\nWhen asked, I tell clients that we\u2019ll know we\u2019re in recession when it\u2019s almost over.\n\nWhat about Canada?\n\nThe Canadian economy is interesting because we\u2019re experiencing a job boom at a time when many economic indicators are screaming bust. Consumer and business spending are extremely weak. Debt servicing is high, even with low interest rates. And our household savings rate is hovering around two per cent (compared to seven to eight per cent in the U.S.).\n\nBut while a made-in-Canada recession may affect your family and lifestyle, it will have limited impact on your portfolio, at least if you\u2019re broadly diversified across industries and geographies.\n\nWhat happens here will barely be felt by foreign-based and globally focused Canadian companies.\n\nA domestic slowdown\u2019s biggest impact will be felt on the fixed-income side of your portfolio. When growth goes negative, our already low (dare I say, recession-like) interest rates will likely fall further. This will push prices on high-quality bonds higher and help stabilize your overall returns.\n\nOf course, if your portfolio is made up mostly of companies dependent on the Canadian consumer such as banks, REITs, retailers and telecommunications companies, you\u2019ll feel a slowdown more.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound cavalier about the Canadian economy, but its mind share will be far greater than its investment impact.\n\nGlobal proportions\n\nOn the other hand, a severe global slowdown (with or without Canada) will move the dial on your portfolio. Corporate profits will decline (into negative territory for some companies) and the associated market psychology will push valuations down. It\u2019s a double whammy \u2014 lower multiples on lower earnings.\n\nBefore you head for cover, however, consider that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) just lowered its world growth estimate for 2020 to 3.4 per cent and talked of a \u201csynchronized slowdown.\u201d This is the lowest level of GDP growth since 2008 but is nowhere near negative (we\u2019d kill for three per cent growth in North America).\n\nIt may be that a synchronized slowdown will trigger a series of rolling recessions. Germany is now flirting with negative growth, the U.K. is going through a self-inflicted slowdown, China is as close as it gets to recession, and yet, the world\u2019s largest economy south of our border, while slowing, is showing no signs of cracking.\n\nDid I say it\u2019s complicated?\n\nRecession proofing\n\nWhether it\u2019s a rolling recession or the big one, we shouldn\u2019t forget that the linkage between the economy and your portfolio is a sloppy one. There should be no expectation of precision, which makes recession proofing tricky. We don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming, what will be affected the most, and the clincher, how well it was anticipated.\n\nOn the latter point, a veteran portfolio manager said to me recently, \u201cThis will be the most anticipated downturn in history.\u201d In other words, Canadian investors aren\u2019t the only ones that are worried about the \u2018R\u2019 word.\n\nTo me, recession proofing means being mentally prepared for it (when, not if), sticking to the plan (you don\u2019t get the up without absorbing some down) and recognizing that downturns cleanse the system of speculation, excess leverage and risky behaviour, all of which curb future returns. And remember, all bull markets are hatched when times are tough.\n\nTom Bradley is President of Steadyhand Investment Funds, a company that offers individual investors low-fee investment funds and clear-cut advice.
