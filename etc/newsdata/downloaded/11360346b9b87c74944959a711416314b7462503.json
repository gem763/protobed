But under a compromise agreed in March this year, under pressure from Italy's then-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini of the far-right League, the operation was extended on the condition that it use only air assets.\n\nThat decision was heavily criticized by non-governmental organizations, who said it would put the rescue of refugees at risk, and even by the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. Her spokeswoman declared that \"Sophia is a maritime operation and it's clear that without naval assets, the operation will not be able to effectively implement its mandate.\"\n\nSalvini, however, argued that the mission's rescue operations encouraged migrants and people-smugglers to undertake perilous trips across the Mediterranean with the aim of seeking asylum in Europe.\n\nFour diplomats told POLITICO the decision to extend the mandate on its current terms was taken on Thursday by the EU's Political and Security Committee (PSC), which is composed of member countries' ambassadors and deals with defense and foreign policy issues.\n\nDespite the six-month extension, one diplomat said the PSC could \"revert to the matter much earlier if needed\u201d \u2014 a hint that naval assets might return to the mission sooner.\n\nTwo of the diplomats said that the latest extension is meant to buy time as a deal among EU countries on taking in migrants rescued in the Mediterranean could be struck in the coming months. Such an agreement could open the way for the return of naval ships to Operation Sophia.\n\nSalvini and his party are no longer in power, having last month brought down their governing coalition with the anti-establishment 5Star Movement. The new administration of the 5Stars and the center-left Democratic party has made clear it wants to be part of the EU's political mainstream.", "description": "Mediterranean rescue mission could see return of naval vessels in coming months.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Sophie In", "T Veld", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-898803818-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
