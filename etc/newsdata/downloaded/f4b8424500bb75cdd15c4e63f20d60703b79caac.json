UPDATE 1-U.S. stock futures fall after Saudi oil attacks\n\n(Adds quotes)\n\nSept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell 0.3% percent\n\nwhen trading resumed on Sunday, a day after attacks on Saudi oil\n\nfacilities that risk disrupting global energy supplies.\n\nSaturday's attacks knocked out more than half of Saudi oil\n\noutput, or more than 5% of global supply. S&P 500 e-mini futures initially fell 0.59%, but cut their\n\nlosses and were last down 0.3%.\n\n\"I would expect a rough day for stocks tomorrow since this\n\nattack largely came out of the blue,\" said Nicholas Colas,\n\nCo-founder of DataTrek Research. \"I'm not overly concerned that\n\nit's more than a one-day move, though. We're not yet talking\n\nabout a large-scale military intervention in the region.\"\n\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury note futures prices TYv1 rose 0.2\n\npct at the start of trading.\n\n\"It is inconceivable that energy costs don't rise by some\n\namount worldwide so the long nightmare of disinflation and below\n\ntarget inflation is over, and that's why the Treasury market is\n\nnot going to have this flight-to-quality drop in yields,\" said\n\nDavid Kotok, chairman & chief investment officer of Cumberland\n\nAdvisors.", "description": "UPDATE 1-U.S. stock futures fall after Saudi oil attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB7Q0U9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
