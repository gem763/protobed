What\u2019s the significance of his first victory as a head coach without Drew Brees? It may sound worthy of champagne. It\u2019s not. Payton will only pop that bottle if he can aim the cork at your head.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a silly stat,\u201d the New Orleans Saints coach said Sunday afternoon following a \u00ad33-27 victory over the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHe\u2019s right. He was a little chippy about it \u2014 when is he not? \u2014 but he\u2019s right. Before this game, Payton hadn\u2019t won without Brees his entire head coaching career, which began in 2006. That\u2019s a span of 195 games \u2014 209 if you include the playoffs. But given the future Hall of Fame quarterback\u2019s durability, Brees had missed just three games before Sunday, two of which were contests in which he rested during the final week of stellar seasons with nothing left to clinch. Payton is fortunate to coach Brees, but it\u2019s not like he needed to validate himself because of some long history of failure sans the franchise quarterback. He was 0-3, for crying out loud, and to be clear, he wasn\u2019t really burning to win two of those games.\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d Payton said, laughing to himself. \u201cIt sells papers.\u201d\n\n[Brewer: The NFL is complicit in Antonio Brown\u2019s self-sabotage]\n\nNo subscriptions gained over here, bud. But it was fun to see Payton get a little feisty after a win. As much as he wanted to minimize the accomplishment, it meant something.\n\nThe Saints \u00ad(2-1) won\u2019t be missing Brees for a random game this time. He is expected to be out at least six weeks recovering from thumb surgery, and New Orleans is in scramble mode, trying to reinvent its style, hoping to accentuate the different skills of backup Teddy Bridgewater and fighting to win enough games while in limbo to keep its championship goals intact for a late-season push when Brees returns.\n\nThis new life began with promise Sunday before 69,005 at CenturyLink Field. Although their offense struggled early, the Saints scored their first touchdown on Deonte Harris\u2019s 53-yard punt return in the first quarter. They scored their second touchdown when safety Vonn Bell scooped up Seattle running back Chris Carson\u2019s fumble and raced 33 yards to the end zone.\n\nOn a day in which the Seahawks, known for ball control and playing fairly clean games, made mistake after mistake, New Orleans played with patience, composure and good fundamentals. Sprinkle in some solid coaching, some good leadership by Bridgewater and the expected excellence of Alvin Kamara, and the Saints stole a game in one of the league\u2019s loudest stadiums.\n\n\u201cI thought we played, in a different way, a pretty complete game,\u201d Payton said.\n\nWhen you reflect on all the success and offensive brilliance over the past 14 seasons of the Payton-Brees era, perhaps New Orleans doesn\u2019t get enough credit for its grit. At their best, the Saints aren\u2019t merely some flashy team. They play physical. Their offensive line is usually good. They have defensive playmakers. Beyond that, they\u2019ve always shown character during the toughest situations, whether it was rebuilding the club a year after Hurricane Katrina, responding after losing the Minneapolis Miracle or their current efforts to put last season\u2019s NFC championship game officiating debacle behind them.\n\nThe Saints are dangerous when they are down, even if Brees isn\u2019t under center. In addition to losing their quarterback, they also didn\u2019t have defensive lineman Sheldon Rankins and Tre\u2019Quan Smith, one of their top wide receivers. They were not fazed.\n\nBridgewater was efficient. He completed 19 of 27 passes for 177 yards with two touchdowns and no turnovers. Kamara was electric. The running back rushed for 69 yards and a touchdown and also caught nine passes for a team-high 92 yards and a score. He left the Seahawks, like many opponents, marveling at his balance and footwork.\n\n\u201cGoing against a lot of guys, I feel like he\u2019s definitely, probably the best, especially at keeping his feet moving,\u201d Seattle defensive end Quinton Jefferson said. \u201cHe runs hard as hell. He doesn\u2019t want to go down, and with him, you\u2019ve got to lay heavy and run your feet. Sometimes, we were shoulder tackling, arm tackling. That\u2019s not going to cut it.\u201d\n\nSaid Bridgewater of Kamara: \u201cHe\u2019s like a human joystick. You give him the ball, and he\u2019s spinning, juking, bouncing off of guys. As a quarterback, you can give him a screen and just watch the play happen. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Man, this guy is a bad man.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[The Scottish Hammer: How Jamie Gillan went from Scotland to an HBCU to Browns rookie standout]\n\nWithout Brees, it was more difficult for the Saints to get the ball to prolific wide receiver Michael Thomas, but he still made an impact with five receptions for 54 yards and a touchdown. He might not finish with the 125 catches he posted last season, but the threat of Thomas remains and helps make the game easier for his teammates. And he is so good that, even when he seems limited, his production is solid.\n\nBridgewater figures to get more comfortable, too. He won his first game since 2015 on Sunday. The knee injury is behind him, and he has a precious opportunity to reestablish himself now. The Saints are paying him $7.25 million to be more than the typical backup. He can play. He can win games. He can keep the Saints from letting this season get away from them.\n\nBefore the game, Brees sent a text message to Bridgewater.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who\u2019s very supportive,\u201d Bridgewater said. \u201cEveryone sees what goes on with football, but Drew is one of those guys that\u2019s very supportive in life.\u201d\n\nFor Bridgewater, the victory was emotional. He told himself Sunday morning, \u201cNo matter what happens, I\u2019m a winner.\u201d He believed. And he triumphed.\n\nNow the Saints can exhale. With a game against the 3-0 Dallas Cowboys next week, the Saints came to CenturyLink Field facing the possibility that they could finish September with a 1-3 record. Their September schedule is the toughest in the league, with four straight games against 2018 playoff teams, including this Los Angeles-Seattle West Coast swing.\n\nInstead of feeling burdened about the schedule and about losing Brees, they competed and made a statement about how good they are overall.\n\n\u201cWell, look, that\u2019s why it\u2019s a team,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThere was something about the week we had in the locker room, even in the pregame.\u201d\n\nThat something was clear Sunday. The Saints are resilient. And talented. And while one victory doesn\u2019t make life without Brees all wonderful, they looked more than capable of surviving the challenge.", "description": "New Orleans earns an impressive victory in Seattle in its first test without its injured star quarterback.", "authors": ["Jerry Brewer", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Jerry Brewer Is A Sports Columnist At The Washington Post.
