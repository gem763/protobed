They don\u2019t get it.\"\n\nHelen also suffered from hyperemesis when she was pregnant with Delilah, which causes severe nausea and vomiting.\n\nShe said this made her feel like terrible parent as she was unable to care for Matilda.\n\n\"I remember feeling like a rubbish Mum because I couldn\u2019t change a nappy\", she said.\n\n\"You feel like a rubbish girlfriend or wife because you literally cannot do anything.\"\n\nBut one thing helen did enjoy about being pregnant was her changing body.\n\n\"I was just so excited to be quite honest with you and I know this might sound a bit cringe, but I would always stick my tummy out a little bit more so it looked like I had a big tummy\", she confessed.\n\n\"I just loved it. I loved having this big bump.\"", "description": "Helen Flanagan has opened up about her mental health battle and why fiance Scott was not helpful during her child birth", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Barcroft Media Via Getty Images", "Mike Marsland Wireimage", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14910469.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Helen-Flanagan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
