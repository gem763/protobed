It\u2019s been great to see.\u201d\n\nThat more open and approachable manner has been noted by Woods\u2019s fellow professionals, said McIlroy.\n\n\u201cI think previously in his career he didn\u2019t take the camaraderie or the being one of the guys as seriously as he does now as he transitions to this latter part of his career,\u201d said McIlroy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely mellowed as a person and probably sees the bigger picture a little more than he used to.\u201d\n\nWoods, who will not play in Shanghai, has taken his fellow Americans Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler under his wing and become something like a mentor to them, McIlroy said.\n\nThe 30-year-old, a four-time Major winner, believes that a roaring Tiger can only be good for golf.\n\n\u201cIf Tiger\u2019s doing well, the game of golf in general thrives so it\u2019s good for everyone involved and I think we\u2019re happy for him,\u201d he said, referring to Woods\u2019s rivals on the course.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot in terms of injuries and some of the breaks that he\u2019s had to take.\n\n\u201cI think because he has opened up a little bit, people know what he\u2019s been through and are happy that he\u2019s got through the other side of it and is playing great again.\u201d", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 Rory McIlroy said Wednesday that Tiger Woods is reaping the benefits of a more \u201cmellow\u201d approach to life after the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/d34413_rory-mcilroy-he-had-up-close-how-tiger-woods-has-changed-as-person-mcilroy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
