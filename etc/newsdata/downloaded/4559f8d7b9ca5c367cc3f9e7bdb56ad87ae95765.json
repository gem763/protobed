He stepped into the Triple J studios this week to blast through a rendition of Clairo\u2018s \u2018Bags\u2019, turning the gentle indie track into a fuzzy fast-paced rock banger.\n\nDominic Fike brought his best weave and impressive guitar skills to the bigger studio, transforming Clairo\u2019s sombre track about exploring a crush on a girl into a driving track that deserves every replay I\u2019m giving it right now.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering if this is another track that I\u2019m going to be putting on my extensive, multi-disc Best Of 2019 compilation\u2013I am. It\u2019s not as massive and sack-whipping as Denzel Curry\u2018s \u2018Bulls On Parade\u2019 or Cub Sport\u2018s gut-wrenching \u2018When The Party\u2019s Over\u2019 but it\u2019s good and fun and makes me yearn for the warm smooch of summer.\n\nDominic also whipped through his own track, \u2018Phone Numbers\u2019, which has him stepping out from behind the guitar to show off his impressive rhyme-spitting skills and tbh I am furious at this multi-talented son of a binch who pulled a multi-million dollar record deal while in prison for breaking house arrest.\n\nIn saying that, anyone who is good enough for Kevin Abstract to want to produce films for, then they\u2019re good enough for me.\n\nTake a moment to sit back and watch Dominic Fike\u2019s Like A Version this week, and enjoy The Good Day\u2122.\n\nI also love that he\u2019s wearing a Weezer shirt in this set as well, because he absolutely slipped a rendition of \u2018Say It Ain\u2019t So\u2019 into his Melbourne show this week and a total of ten (10) people in the sold-out crowd knew what the fuck was going on. I simply must respect that move.", "description": "Florida rapper, singer, and muso, Dominic Fike, donned his best curls and put the big fuzz on Clairo's crusher hit 'Bags' for this week's Like A Version.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/dominic-fike-LAV-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
