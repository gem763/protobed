That\u2019s where the zoo is. And the carousel. And the pond where hobbyists launch their radio-guided sailboats. And the lake, where couples launch themselves in rowboats.\n\nThe southern part of the park is surrounded by some of the most affluent neighborhoods in the country and is in the shadow of \u201cBillionaires\u2019 Row,\u201d where new condominium towers are stratospheric in height and price.\n\nThe northern end of the park is a different story. It is surrounded by less affluent blocks filled with largely African-American and Latino residents, has fewer must-see gems and draws significantly fewer visitors and far less attention.\n\nThat is about to change. The nonprofit group that manages Central Park is planning the largest project it has undertaken in its nearly 40 years: a $110 million investment in the mostly forgotten northern corner, which may not be on many tourists\u2019 itineraries but which is a vital backyard to surrounding blocks where green space is scarce.", "description": "Replacing a timeworn pool and skating rink at the northern end of the park, which has received less attention over the years.", "authors": ["James Barron"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/nyregion/18centralpark/18centralpark-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
