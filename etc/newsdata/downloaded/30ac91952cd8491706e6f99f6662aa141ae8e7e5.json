For writer Saeed Jones, Columbus, Ohio, is the place to be a literary star.", "language": "en", "text": "Never mind how the state voted in 2016, Ohio\u2019s capital ticks all the boxes on a typical millennial check list: craft-beer pubs, cafes that could just as easily be in Brooklyn, retro barber shops, independent bookstores and most important, affordability.\n\nBut Jones, born in Memphis and raised in a suburb in north Texas, isn\u2019t (just) here because it\u2019s cost-effective and unexpectedly cool. He\u2019s here because after a lifetime of struggle, he\u2019s found peace. (Also a love of tailgating, but more on that later.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAbout a year ago, back in New York, Jones, who until May was an editor at BuzzFeed, grappled with serious depression. \u201cThe city was wearing me out; my job was wearing me out; America was wearing me out,\u201d he wrote in an essay.\n\nIsolation, fear and anxiety had taken root in his childhood. Growing up, Jones was haunted by the killings of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was beaten by white supremacists, chained to the back of their truck and dragged down a Texas road, and Matthew Shepard, a gay 21-year-old fatally attacked by strangers in Wyoming.\n\nJones writes in his critically acclaimed memoir: \u201cI was walking through a dusty, fluorescent-lit hallway \u2014 halfway to the assembly hall, trying with every filament of my body to look cool \u2014 when the two truths finally collided:\n\nAD\n\nBeing black can get you killed.\n\nAD\n\nBeing gay can get you killed.\n\nBeing a black gay boy is a death wish.\u201d\n\nHe grappled with angst, desire and a slew of unanswered questions. Carol Sweet-Jones, the single mother who raised him, did right by her son in nearly all the ways that count. (Daily, she tucked sweet notes into his lunch box; \u201cI love you more than the air I breathe,\u201d she signed off.) Over the subject of sexuality, however, a chasm grew between mother and son.\n\nEven after he came out to his mom around age 19 and lived openly among friends, he was deeply unhappy, engaging in casual \u2014 sometimes violent \u2014 sex.\n\n\u201cI buried myself in the bodies of other men,\u201d he writes in his memoir, \u201cso I could feel something other than the depression that was rolling in like a fog bank.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe was earning stellar grades at Western Kentucky University, winning national speech and debate competitions, routinely calling home. And yet: \u201cI was just miserable,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nA 2007 New Year\u2019s Eve party in Phoenix brought a reckoning. A man with whom he got intimate clobbered Jones. Daniel, as he is called in the book, punched and bit, drunkenly \u201cbeating the desire\u201d Jones had brought out in him \u201cback down to where it usually hid.\u201d\n\nJones managed to scramble free. \u201cI think that night in Phoenix, Arizona saved my life,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m very lucky to have walked out of that room.\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s in a whole new house.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Jones \u2014 exuberant and chatty, wearing a red \u201cOhio\u201d T-shirt \u2014 swings open the door of his Columbus apartment and envelops me in a hug. Any East- or West Coaster who enters his amenity-packed home is likely to be thwacked with a heavy mix of emotions: awe, admiration, envy. Mainly envy. Sunlight filters in through an expanse of extremely tall windows. (\u201cI wish you could see the sunset, because girl, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d he says later.) Jones\u2019s wooden writing desk, paired with a cheery orange chair, resides in a corner of the living room, allowing him to compose poems while drinking up the great views of his hip neighborhood. Although his latest book is an autobiography, Jones \u2014 whose debut poetry collection, \u201cPrelude to Bruise,\u201d was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and was awarded the 2015 PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award for Poetry \u2014 continues to write poems.\n\nGreenery dots the space \u2014 small ferns, a Sansevieria, a ZZ plant. The atmosphere is soothing (and the price, at $1,400 a month, makes me want to sob).\n\n\u201cI just feel calmer than I think I ever have in my life,\u201d Jones says. His peace is palpable, as is his merriment. Jones has a loud, punchy laugh; it slices the air and fills it with joy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStart chatting with Jones, and you can convince yourself you\u2019ve known him decades. We breezily ping-pong between discussion of the dating scene (Columbus has a large gay population, he tells me; also have I seen how good the men look around here?) to luggage (he just bought a Tumi suitcase, per Roxane Gay\u2019s suggestion) to packing for his book tour (\u201cWhy do I have three ponchos? I don\u2019t need to take three ponchos.\u201d).\n\nIn Columbus, he\u2019s embracing everything the city has to offer, including tailgating, an activity whose appeal surprised him.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in college, this would\u2019ve freaked me out, no question,\u201d Jones says. \u201cNow I\u2019m like, it\u2019s cute.\u201d He grew up around tailgating in Texas, but there, he says, it felt threatening, unwelcoming. (\u201cI felt like being at a football game was to be an interloper in enemy territory,\u201d he clarifies later.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut now there\u2019s no aggression, not even a whiff of awkwardness. Just ease.\n\nTailgating evokes images of crowded parking lots, rowdy fans, burgers and beers and the backs of vans or pickup trucks. Yet we begin our afternoon in a large, industrial, rather sedate bar and restaurant two miles from Ohio Stadium, about to order spiked seltzer water. Soon, more drinks are ordered and Jones and three friends move outside, into the sunshine-y, 70-degree afternoon. At last, outside Varsity Club, a sports bar spitting distance from the football stadium, I spy full-on revelry. We flash our IDs then filter into a gated area, the six of us a tiny trickle into a sea of fans. People eat pizza, people loiter, Sugarhill Gang\u2019s \u201cApache (Jump on It)\u201d plays and people dance, some better than others. Time marches forward, and as we near 7 p.m., Jones and his friend Matt Arnstine \u2014 who are attending tonight\u2019s game \u2014 start pulling away.\n\nHours later, after Jones has live-tweeted a considerable chunk of the game to his 125,000-plus followers (\u201cI just surprised myself cheering without irony. OMG.\u201d), he slips out at halftime. OSU goes on to beat Michigan State, 34-10.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShortly after his departure, Jones is informed via group text that his friends and I are still hanging out. He swings by, and when he spots me, he is incredulous: \u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d See, he tells me, there\u2019s something about Columbus; you just get swept away. Yes, I suppose. I hail from the Midwest; I understand its charms. This city has a certain warmth, a particular sweetness.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else that I can\u2019t pinpoint, another piece. In a recent essay, Jones offered a hint. During a visit to Columbus in fall 2018, fond memories of his mother lured him into a McDonald\u2019s. \u201cMy mom used to get sausage biscuits for us on Saturday mornings. Sure, it should concern me that, all these years later, the meat product and bread product taste exactly the same,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cBut how much are you willing to pay for a taste of a bright memory?\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cI walked into the McDonald\u2019s and a group of old black men sat at a table, reading newspapers, drinking coffee and laughing. Deep, black laughter. Hearty laughter. The way black people laugh in Toni Morrison novels. When they saw me, they let their chuckles settle and said \u2018Good morning, young man\u2019 almost in unison. I smiled and politely nodded. The young man at the register was just as warm, just as black, as was his coworker. I remembered then that Toni Morrison was from Ohio and thought \u2018black people have been happy here for quite some time.\u2019\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBecause, quiet as it\u2019s kept, black people are everywhere and if you don\u2019t understand that, you don\u2019t understand America.\u201d\n\nLater, back in my overpriced D.C. apartment, it comes to me. A quote from, of all places, the third season of HBO series \u201cTrue Detective\u201d: \u201cWhat if something went unbroken? All this life, all this loss \u2014 what if it was really one long story that just kept going and going until it healed itself? Wouldn\u2019t that be a story worth telling? Wouldn\u2019t that be a story worth hearing?\u201d\n\nSaeed Jones has suffered. He wrestled with desire for decades. He beat back dread. When his mother died in 2011, he stared down grief. Columbus may be a supremely soft place to land, but I suspect that, first, he mended his own wounds. He forged new connections. He fought for his life, and he won.\n\nNneka McGuire is a multiplatform editor at The Lily, The Washington Post\u2019s website that focuses on the stories of women.\n\nAD", "description": "The author of \u201cHow We Fight For Our Lives\u201d explains why he left the Big Apple for the Midwest", "authors": ["Nneka Mcguire", "Multiplatform Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aLRzi9o6423mjawTUEgu6wYI10g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GAP4MJHKDAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
