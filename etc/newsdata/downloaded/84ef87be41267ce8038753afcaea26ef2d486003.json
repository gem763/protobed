But Trump wasn\u2019t interested and told Kushner he didn\u2019t think his core voters would care much about a bipartisan deal for which he\u2019s since accused Democrats of trying to steal credit.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt was clear he thinks it\u2019s a total dud,\u201d said a person familiar with the meeting. \u201cHe made it abundantly clear he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth talking about.\u201d\n\nKushner, whose own father spent more than a year in federal prison, worked closely with Democratic and Republican senators to get the criminal justice reform bill over the finish line last year \u2013 often telling his tough-on-crime boss it was worth expending political capital to seize a rare opportunity to overcome the deeply partisan divide on Capitol Hill and solidify his image as a pragmatic dealmaker.\n\nBut now, Trump \u201cis telling people he\u2019s mad\u201d at how criminal justice reform has panned out, according to a person close to the president. \u201cHe\u2019s really mad that he did it. He\u2019s saying that he\u2019s furious at Jared because Jared is telling him he\u2019s going to get all these votes of all these felons.\u201d\n\nFor months, president Donald Trump (left) has ignored his son-in-law Jared Kushner's signature legislative achievement at his campaign rallies. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, for months, the president has glossed over his son-in-law\u2019s signature legislative achievement at his campaign rallies. If he brings up criminal justice reform, it\u2019s almost always to mock his predecessors for their inability to get it done. Otherwise, as he did at his three most recent campaign events, he skips over it entirely, indulging in long-winded rants about unresolved issues like trade and immigration instead of plugging one of the few bipartisan triumphs of his administration.\n\nThe subject\u2019s notable absence from Trump\u2019s 2020 stump speech offers a raw look at the president\u2019s political instincts, which strongly veer toward partisan fights and away from the soaring appeals to national unity of past White House incumbents. And it lacks appeal to his base of rural and older white voters, who often respond better to hard-line rhetoric on the topic of law and order.\n\nThe nub of the issue for Trump, say White House officials, congressional aides and friends of the president, who were granted anonymity to speak candidly on the matter, is that he no longer sees criminal justice reform as a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 booster heading into 2020. He brings it up at official events, in response to reporters, and to religious groups \u2014 and it was a key part of Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in January, when he welcomed home the first inmate to be released under the First Step Act \u2014 but it\u2019s far from a permanent fixture of his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cIt would be difficult to say it\u2019s a change of heart. I don\u2019t think his heart was ever really in it,\u201d said one White House official, adding that some Trump aides questioned why the president \u2014 who once declared himself \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d \u2014 endorsed the First Step Act in the first place.\n\nWhite House staffers have remarked to one another on the irony that Trump wants to give the death penalty to criminals like drug smugglers, but also supported legislation that would greenlight the early release of some non-violent drug offenders.\n\nIn response to this story, a White House official said, \u201cThis false premise is another convoluted contradictory, media-manufactured joke. The president is clearly proud of all of his record-setting accomplishments \u2013 including the landmark bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform that data shows will save money, reduce crime and make communities safer.\u201d\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly 9AM on SEPT. 24 for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly LIVE\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting this spring, Trump complained that Democratic co-sponsors of the First Step Act skipped the bill signing at the White House last December (Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island., was the only Democrat to attend) and have refused to give him credit for passing prison reform when his immediate predecessor couldn\u2019t, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting. He\u2019s said as much publicly in recent days, writing in a tweet earlier this month: \u201cI got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close.\u201d\n\nThe tweet came after NBC\u2019s Lester Holt omitted any mention of Trump\u2019s role in advancing criminal justice reform during a televised town hall on the network. The president felt the televised special was disingenuous and thought singer John Legend, who participated in it, \u201cparaded himself out like he was the great savior of criminal justice reform,\u201d according to a senior administration official.\n\nTrump has also complained privately about Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who worked with Kushner to pass criminal justice reform in the House, but has been critical of the president ever since. Jeffries, who chairs the House Democratic caucus, called Trump \u201cthe grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\u201d during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event in January.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been telling Jared, \u2018I got nothing from that,\u2019\u201d a person close to the White House said of criminal justice reform, adding that the president feels duped by claims that his popularity has grown and that he is frustrated with Kushner\u2019s attempts to \u201cjawbone\u201d the issue into every speech he delivers.\n\n\u201cJared has got all these stats like \u2018every rapist in Florida is now going to vote Republican,\u2019\u201d quipped the person close to Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t believe it and he\u2019s mad Jared sold him this thing,\u201d the same person said. (The First Step Act only gives certain nonviolent offenders a chance to shorten their sentences, and excludes sex offenders from early release.)\n\nKushner has claimed publicly that more non-violent ex-felons in Florida, where they recently became eligible to vote, are registering as Republicans than as Democrats. In a rare television appearance in April, he told Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham that he found that statistic \u201cvery pleasing\u201d and one \u201cthat will surprise a lot of people when they see the new coalition that President Trump is building.\u201d\n\nBut it is unclear how Kushner and his team procured such data. As of March, more than 2,000 formerly incarcerated felons had registered to vote in Florida, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice, which did not disclose the new registrants\u2019 party affiliations. An aide to Kushner did not provide details on the source of the data in time for publication.\n\nSome Trump allies argue that Kushner, who continues to monitor implementation of the First Step Act, is unlikely to persuade media personalities and Democratic lawmakers who support either to credit Trump with working across the aisle to get the measure passed.\n\n\u201cJones was happy with Trump for a day. That\u2019s all Trump got,\u201d said the person close to Trump, referring to the liberal CNN pundit and former Obama adviser, who once described the First Step Act as \u201ca Christmas miracle.\u201d Jones did attend a White House summit on prison reform this April \u2013 months after the bill passed \u2013 and recently met with Kushner to discuss its impact.\n\nJones, who cofounded the bipartisan criminal justice reform nonprofit #cut50, noted that he\u2019s continued to sing Trump\u2019s praises on the topic, including in a recent interview with CNN where he celebrated Trump\u2019s role in signing the First Step Act into law. He said he received \u201ca very positive\u201d direct message from the president afterwards, \u201csaying he was proud of what I had said.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a bunch of people in the building, they didn\u2019t like it before, during or after, and they\u2019ve always been able to leak out anonymous bullshit quotes that then very quickly have egg on their faces because Trump does something else positive in this direction of throws in another line in a speech,\u201d said Jones, who confirmed that Trump has been frustrated with the lack of credit he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s disappointing to President Trump here is the same media, political pundits and elected officials that talked about the vital importance of criminal justice reform for decades fell silent and refused to give credit to the only one who was able to deliver: Donald Trump,\u201d the White House official countered.\n\nSome Trump allies worry that the more the president talks about criminal justice reform, the more vulnerable he becomes if a prisoner released early under the restructured sentencing guidelines is ever accused of committing another crime. When Republicans battled over criminal justice reform last fall, a small group of conservative senators who ultimately opposed the bill warned Trump of the dire consequences he could face if an inmate who won early release became a repeat offender.\n\n\u201cYou let people out of jail early, commute sentences, something bad happens because of this effort [and] it\u2019s going to be one more egg on their face \u2013 or even worse, blood on their hands,\u201d said a former Senate Republican staffer.\n\nAnother GOP aide pointed to a negative ad campaign Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone recently launched against Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards over his support for statewide sentencing reform. The ad accuses Edwards of putting \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d ex-felons \u201cback on our streets where they robbed, attacked, [and] murdered.\u201d A person familiar with the ad buy said it was prompted by the September arrest of a Louisiana man on burglary charges who was released early last year as part of a parole reform bill passed by the state legislature in 2016.\n\n\u201cAny smart political person would not go out bragging that they let criminals out of jail,\u201d the GOP aide said.", "description": "The president thinks criminal justice reform is a political loser, and hasn't been shy about saying so.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman", "Elana Schor", "Burgess Everett", "Eliana Johnson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2a/4e/e755f0ff4e308b02eb1ecd5c4963/20190922-bill-kushner-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
