The mob then descended on the main protest area in the capital, tearing down tents and setting them ablaze while warning that they wouldn\u2019t allow their political leaders -- Hezbollah\u2019s Hassan Nasrallah and his ally, parliament speaker Nabih Berri -- to be criticized or insulted.\n\nThe show of violence by Lebanon\u2019s two main Shiite Muslim parties is a turning point in the uprising, which protesters say has transcended for the first time the sectarian and party divisions that tend to dominate Lebanese politics.\n\nSecretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement on Tuesday that \u201cthe Lebanese people want an efficient and effective government, economic reform, and an end to endemic corruption. Any violence or provocative actions must stop, and we call upon Lebanon\u2019s army and security services to continue to ensure the rights and safety of the protesters.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high for Lebanon, which straddles the region\u2019s geopolitical fault lines and has often been a proxy battleground for the Middle East\u2019s broader conflicts. The 15-year civil war ended in 1990 but still haunts a country where the warlords became the rulers and have remained in power ever since. It is this political class that protesters accuse of entrenched corruption that has brought the economy to the brink of crisis.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all sides to avoid violence.\n\n\u201cHe calls on all political actors to seek a political solution that will preserve the stability of the country and respond to the aspirations of the Lebanese people,\u201d according to an e-mailed statement from his press office. \u201cHe calls on all actors to avoid violence and respect the rights to peaceful assembly and expression.\u201d\n\nHow Lebanon\u2019s Unrest Is Both New and More of the Same: QuickTake\n\nCelebrations broke out in central Beirut after Hariri announcement, with protesters thanking him for taking the first step to address popular demands. But protesters who began to regroup amid wrecked and smoldering tents said they now wanted other top officials to follow suit.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Lebanese have taken to the streets across the country since Oct. 17, demanding the ouster of a ruling class they say has lined its pockets from the public purse while neglecting services and living standards.\n\nThe government presented an emergency package last week that sought to address some of the grievances by laying out plans to rescue the country\u2019s finances and set up an anti-graft committee. But it was rejected by demonstrators who said they would accept nothing less than the resignation of the government and key officials.\n\nSince then, Hariri has sought to agree with his rivals on a new cabinet lineup to satisfy the crowds without leaving a political vacuum in one of the world\u2019s most debt-laden economies. But he faced opposition from Hezbollah, an armed group that performed well in the last elections and is part of the largest coalition in parliament and government.\n\nNasrallah and his Christian allies in the political party of President Michel Aoun have opposed a change in the government, saying it could lead to chaos. He has accused the protesters of being funded by unspecified foreign agencies and embassies, and warned that the standoff might spark civil war if they did not end their road closures. Those accusations were widely repeated by the mobs who overran the protest camp, denouncing demonstrators as drug addicts with loose morals.\n\nAccording to the constitution, Aoun must now hold parliamentary consultations and name a new prime minister who will be tasked with forming a new government. Demonstrators have called for a cabinet of technocrats to lead the country through the promised reforms and toward early elections based on a more equitable election law.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Lebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Saad Hariri stepped down Tuesday after two weeks of anti-government protests descended into violence.\u201cToday, I won\u2019t hide that I reached a dead end, and it\u2019s time for a major shock to confront the crisis,\u201d Hariri said in a televised address. \u201cI\u2019m going to the presidential", "authors": ["Lin Noueihed", "Dana Khraiche"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h_ZzQqUdLEpGWTFfklMQMA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/5529c69ce85f0c2592ce166c2820d994", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
