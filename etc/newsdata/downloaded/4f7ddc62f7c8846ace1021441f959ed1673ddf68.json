Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., the ringleader of the protest, told reporters.\n\nChanting \u201cLet us in! Let us in!,\u201d the members of the conservative Freedom Caucus then entered a restricted area in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF), where the interviews with witnesses have been conducted. Some appeared to carry cellphones into the room in violation of security protocols.\n\nThe chaotic scene unfolded one day after William Taylor, the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, delivered damning testimony detailing how the president had linked the release of U.S. military aid to Ukraine to public assurances that President Volodymyr Zelensky would launch an investigation into one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nRep.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ordered Capitol Police to remove the intruders, after which a security sweep of the facility was required.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Gaetz denied he had coordinated the protest with the White House.\n\n\u201cI organized and led this press conference, including entering the committee room,\u201d Gaetz said in a tweet. \u201cI never discussed this with any White House official including the President.\u201d\n\nWhile a key administration talking point has been that the Democrats are conducting their impeachment inquiry in secret, Republicans sit on all three of the committees involved in the investigation and have attended each of the sessions.\n\nWhen Republicans controlled the House, they conducted closed-door interviews with witnesses in their three-year investigation into the terror attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\u201cI can get more information in a five-hour deposition than I can in five minutes of listening to a colleague ask questions in committee hearings,\u201d then-Rep. Trey Gowdy, who led the Benghazi hearings, explained.\n\nSchiff has said that Democrats plan to release the transcripts of the interviews they have conducted at the conclusion of this stage of the inquiry. While the specifics of the testimony are not known, the opening statements by some witnesses that have been released to the press and accounts by Democrats on the committee have begun to corroborate the view that Trump pursued a quid pro quo arrangement with Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nFlanked by about two dozen House Republicans, Rep. Matt Gaetz speaks during Wednesday's press conference at the Capitol.

They also brought their cellphones, which is a violation. They violated House rules by trying to crash committees which they don\u2019t sit on,\u201d Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., told reporters. \u201cAll of this is an attack right on the investigation.\u201d", "description": "Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus stormed the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities and blasted Democrats for conducting closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wGxTTeoJ5C0gRHOMMIf._Q--~B/aD0zMDU2O3c9NDU4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/032cd4f0-f5bb-11e9-b6eb-70a8bdba9adc", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
