The move would fundamentally reverse civil rights for millions of people, LGBT leaders say, and raises fears that LGBT people may lose the minimal protections and resources they have won in past years.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical point in history,\u201d said Alesdair Ittelson, the law and policy director at interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth. \u201cThe outcome of this case is going to have a tremendous impact on everyone.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s most aggressive anti-gay legal argument yet\n\nUnder Obama, LGBT people won a number of key victories, including the repeal of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d ban on gay military members, new protections under the Affordable Care Act, an anti-discrimination executive order and expanded recognition of trans rights.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has sought to reverse healthcare protections for trans people, moved to ban trans people from serving in the military, eliminated rules protecting trans students and pushed to allow businesses to turn away gay and trans customers if they seek a religious exemption.\n\nLast month, the Trump justice department made its most aggressive anti-gay legal argument to date, urging the supreme court to rule that gay employees are not protected under a longstanding act that prohibits \u201csex discrimination\u201d. The DoJ filed briefs related to three supreme court cases to be heard together on 8 October \u2013 two involving gay men fired from their jobs, and a third involving a woman terminated by her employer after she came out as trans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Yorkers protest against discrimination towards the LGBT community in the aftermath of the decision to ban transgender people from serving in the US military, in July 2017.

But the DoJ is now arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are excluded under Title VII because \u201csex\u201d narrowly refers to whether people are \u201cbiologically male or female\u201d. The definition not only seeks to invalidate trans people, but also altogether erases intersex people, who are born with a mix of what are typically considered male and female sex characteristics and make up 1.7% of the population.\n\n\u201cWhen the federal government and the nation\u2019s lawyers come out against you and say that your rights don\u2019t exist, it hurts the most vulnerable members of our community,\u201d said Robin Maril, the associate legal director at the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).\n\nLifetimes of rejection: \u2018We don\u2019t have a place for someone like you\u2019\n\nLGBT people said existing laws meant to shield them are inadequate and poorly enforced \u2013 and that if they were to lose what little recourses they have now, the consequences could be devastating.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done so much work to prove our humanity to the rest of the world,\u201d said Aria Sa\u2019id, a San Francisco advocate who helped create the country\u2019s first-ever trans cultural district. \u201cThe policies and laws are in place, but that doesn\u2019t mean the social attitudes are \u2026 Trans people are literally living at the will of other people\u2019s opinions.\u201d\n\nSa\u2019id cited the danger and abuse trans people face in homeless shelters \u2013 a problem that could be exacerbated by a May 2019 proposal by US housing officials that would, in effect, allow \u201csingle-sex\u201d shelters to turn away trans people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening and terrifying,\u201d said Koomah, a 32-year-old Houston-based activist who was previously homeless and is intersex. \u201cWe are made to violate the law because of the way that our bodies are.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aria Sa\u2019id says the nonstop bad news from DC, along with the frequent murders of black trans women, takes a severe toll on trans women Photograph: Dusti Cunningham/Courtesy of Aria Sa\u2019id\n\nKoomah, who goes by a single name and is also genderfluid, said that when they were a teenager at a homeless shelter, they appeared androgynous, and staff forced them to undergo a genital examination to determine if they should be in the boys or girls section. Ultimately, the shelter kicked them out and they wound up on the street.\n\n\u201cI was told, \u2018We don\u2019t have a place for someone like you.\u2019\u201d said Koomah. \u201cMy housing is still unstable today, and even as an adult I know that if I get put in a homeless shelter, I may or may not be given space to be there.\u201d\n\nKhloe Rios, a 30-year-old not-for-profit manager who made headlines this month when she and a group of other trans women were forcibly dragged out of a downtown Los Angeles bar, said it was already difficult for trans people to find steady jobs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to survive,\u201d she said, noting that she was unexpectedly fired from her first job out of college at a marketing agency and that she believed she was targeted because she was trans.\n\nShe added it was painful to think about the ways Trump has fueled hate against her community: \u201cI have no words \u2026 I feel very defeated. It\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nCan Trump legalize discrimination?\n\nCivil rights experts said they are confident the DoJ\u2019s arguments would fail at the supreme court, given the well-established precedent from previous rulings.\n\nMaril from HRC noted that it was conservative former justice Antonin Scalia who wrote a critical ruling on Title VII that made clear it covered groups beyond the most narrow interpretation of \u201csex\u201d. Scalia wrote: \u201cStatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.\u201d\n\nBut Harper Jean Tobin, the policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality, noted that even if the supreme court does affirm LGBT people\u2019s rights, it\u2019s likely the administration would pursue other avenues to legalize discrimination.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s America is an America where anyone who doesn\u2019t look like him can be pushed to the margins of society,\u201d she said. \u201cFor being transgender \u2026 you can be kicked out of your job, your school and the hospital emergency room.\u201d\n\nThe DoJ\u2019s anti-LGBT arguments in court represented such an extraordinary U-turn for the US government, that it raised fears other marginalized groups could be targeted, too, added Lynly Egyes, the director of litigation at the Transgender Law Center. \u201cIf they are able to do this complete shift, who is next under Trump\u2019s attacks?\u201d\n\nThe DoJ did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe damage already done: \u2018I feel defeated\u2019\n\nThe constant barrage of headlines has already emboldened bigotry and caused a lot of anxiety, activists said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tanya Armstrong. Photograph: Courtesy of Tanya Armstrong\n\nRiver Gowan Stone, a 40-year-old who is non-binary and trans, said he has faced repeated workplace discrimination throughout his career, and that it was hard to accept that things are getting worse: \u201cI have so much to contribute to the world, but it\u2019s terrifying to be at the whims of whoever I\u2019m encountering.\u201d\n\nThe nonstop bad news from DC, along with the frequent murders of black trans women, took a severe toll on trans women, said Sa\u2019id, the San Francisco organizer: \u201cIt literally has me in stages of severe depression.\u201d\n\nUltimately, no policy can stop people from living as their true selves, said Tanya Armstrong, a 34-year-old Los Angeles resident who is non-binary and intersex: \u201cWe\u2019re here, and we\u2019ve always been here, and no matter how many times they try to sweep us under the rug, we\u2019re still going to be here.\u201d\n\nSa\u2019id added, \u201cI know who I am. I know that I deserve to breathe, and that I deserve to exist.\u201d", "description": "The Trump justice department is pushing to make it legal to fire people for being gay or transgender", "authors": ["Sam Levin", "Robert Shiller"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e73be2b0ba4e6b1328f6a7c81b8a3c069793ed8/0_336_6552_3931/master/6552.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24964e517e3e2f47e74fd13cd779578a"}
