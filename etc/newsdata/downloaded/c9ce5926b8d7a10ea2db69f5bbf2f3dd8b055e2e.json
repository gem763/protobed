The strike resulted in 49,000 workers walking off the job, shutting down 33 manufacturing plants\n\nTerms of the tentative four-year contract were not released, but it's likely to include some pay raises, lump sum payments to workers, and requirements that GM build new vehicles in US factories.\n\nEarly on, the company also known as GM offered new products in Detroit and Lordstown, Ohio, two of the four US cities where it planned to close factories.\n\nGM also offered to build a new electric pickup truck to keep the Detroit-Hamtramck plant open and to build an electric vehicle battery factory in or near Lordstown, Ohio, where the company is closing an assembly plant.\n\nThe battery factory would employ far fewer workers and pay less money than the assembly plant.\n\nGM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the US auto industry.\n\nMembers of the United Auto Workers continue to picket after news of a tentative contract agreement with General Motors, in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Striking workers are expected to return to work once the tentative deal is ratified by two union comittees\n\nRyan Piper with the United Auto Workers continues to picket after news of a tentative contract agreement with General Motors, in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. If the new deal is approved, GM facilities in nine states will re-open\n\nDriven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other car makers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump's trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America's trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.\n\nAmid that uncertainty, GM workers have wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly.\n\nThey argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health - earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter - they want a bigger share.\n\nIf approved, the contract agreement will set the pattern for negotiations at Fiat Chrysler and Ford. It wasn't clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.\n\nThe union's International Executive Board first has to vote on the GM deal, then union leaders from factories will travel to Detroit for a vote on Thursday. The earliest workers could return would be after that.\n\nIn past years, it's taken a minimum of three or four days and as long as several weeks for the national ratification vote. Workers took almost two weeks to finish voting on their last GM agreement, in October of 2015. Then, skilled trades workers rejected it, causing further delays.\n\nThis time around - with a federal corruption investigation that has implicated the past two UAW presidents and brought convictions of five union officials - many union members don't trust the leadership and likely won't want to return to work until they've gotten a chance to vote on the deal themselves.\n\nIn August, the FBI raided the suburban Detroit home of UAW President Gary Jones. He has not been charged and has not commented on the raid.\n\nA sign at a General Motors facility in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, is pictured above. The new, tentative contract is likely to include some pay raises, lump sum payments to workers, and requirements that GM build more vehicles in the US\n\nEarlier this month, Jones' successor as union regional director in Missouri was charged in a $600,000 embezzlement scheme, and another UAW official pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks from union vendors.\n\nEight other people - including five UAW officials - have been convicted over the past two years of looting a jointly run Fiat Chrysler-UAW training center for blue-collar workers. Another official was charged in September.\n\nThere's also no guarantee that the first contract deal with GM will pass. Some workers on the picket lines said they may not vote for the first offer.\n\n'We're not just going to take the first thing that they give us,' worker Tina Black said in September from the picket line at an engine and transmission plant in Romulus, Michigan, near Detroit's main airport.\n\nBut Louis Rocha, president of a UAW local in Orion Township, Michigan, said recently that union negotiators have taken strong positions against the company. 'I think we're going to be OK,' he said of the ratification vote.\n\nThe strike had shut down 33 GM manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S. It was the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007 that had little impact on the company.", "description": "A tentative deal between the US automaker and the United Auto Workers was reached that will end a strike that began September 15 once a new 4-year contract is ratified by two union committees.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
