Gatland didn't betray much emotion six minutes from the end when the salvage act took place, but inside he must have been churning.\n\nFrance had lost Sebastien Vahaamahina to a red card with half-an-hour remaining \u2013 for the lock's wild elbow to the head of Aaron Wainwright \u2013 but they had exuded defiance and retained their lead. However, in the 74th minute, Wales turned the tables.\n\nWales' players react after Ross Moriarty scores the match winning try to beat France in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final\n\nWales had to wait until the final six minutes before Moriarty's converted try saw them defeat France 20-19 in the Oita Dome\n\nIt had to be him!\n\n\n\nYellow-carded earlier, Moriarty may just have rescued Wales' World Cup here...\n\n\n\nTMO checks and is happy#RWC2019 #ITVRugby #WALvFRA pic.twitter.com/NE2an2pkRM \u2014 ITV Rugby (@ITVRugby) October 20, 2019\n\nThe French had a scrum in front of their line and they were driven back powerfully. Tomos Williams ripped the ball from the grasp of Louis Picamoles and Justin Tipuric grabbed it barely a metre out. He hurled himself forward but was stopped short by Camille Lopez. But Ross Moriarty \u2013 who had been sin-binned soon after coming on as a replacement \u2013 was alongside in support and he was able to pick up and lunge over to score.\n\nDan Biggar added the conversion and Wales, suddenly ahead at last, ran down the clock. Their fly-half then dispatched the ball into the stands to clinch the result which amounted to grand larceny. France were the better side in most aspects except the only one that mattered; the final scoreline. Their centres, Virimi Vakatawa and Gael Fickou, wrought havoc throughout. Their scrum-half, Antoine Dupont, was utterly outstanding.\n\nIn contrast, Wales were stodgy and one-dimensional in attack. They were gritty and committed and tenacious, as always, but when they had 30 minutes to overhaul a team of 14, they appeared incapable of doing so. They lacked a cutting edge. Their decision-making often failed them. They were often second-best in the contact areas. But they found a way.\n\nSo instead of a grim end to his near 12-year tenure as Wales head coach, Gatland can now look forward to another marquee occasion. He will know his side must make vast improvements in the next seven days, or they could face oblivion in the semi-finals. But they are still in the hunt. The crusade goes on.\n\nSebastien Vahaamahina was given a red card in the second half following a horrific elbow on Aaron Wainwright (left)\n\nVahaamahina's elbow during a ruck was not spotted by the referee but was investigated by TMO which led to his dismissal\n\nFollowing the review there was no surprise when referee Jaco Peyper sent off the France lock to leave them with 14 men\n\nRED CARD!\n\n\n\nVahaamahina sees red after an elbow on Aaron Wainwright.

Yoann Huget went close down the left flank and seconds later, Tipuric had to produce a desperate, lunging intervention to prevent Brunel's side breaking through on the opposite wing. However, from his turnover, the clearance didn't go far and the reprieve was brief.\n\nFrom the attacking lineout, the French pack blasted towards the line with a maul and Vahaamahina forced his way over to score. Ntamack's conversion struck a post and bounced out, by the Gallic uprising was under way.\n\nThat was in the sixth minute and just two minutes later, France struck again with a superb second try. From Ntamack's pass left near halfway, Vakatawa stepped around Josh Navidi and gave a deft off-load to release Ntamack again.\n\nThe No 10 passed inside to half-back partner Dupont and he in turn sent Charles Ollivon hurtling clear to the posts. Ntamack added the extra two points and before Wales had even established a foothold, they were 12-0.\n\nVahaamahina got France off to a flying start after scoring their first try in just the fifth minute at the Oita Stadium\n\nCharles Ollivon went over the try line just three minutes later to leave Wales stunned in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final\n\nOllivon (right) celebrates his try, France's second of the match in front of Wales's George North (left), as they took control\n\nMATCH FACTS Wales: L. Williams, North, Watkin, Parkes, Adams, Biggar, G. Davies (T. Williams 55), W. Jones (Carre 63), Owens (Dee 76), Francis (Lewis 63), Ball (Beard 63), A. Jones, Wainwright, Tipuric, Navidi (Moriarty 28) Tries: Wainwright, Moriarty Conversions: Biggar (2) Penalties: Biggar (2) Sin-bin: Moriarty France: Medard (Rattez 77), Penaud, Vakatawa, Fickou, Huget, Ntamack (Lopez 41), Dupont (Serin 73), Poirot (Baille 68), Guirado (Chat 50), Slimani (Setiano 73), Le Roux (Picamoles 66), Vahaamahina, Lauret, Ollivon, Alldritt (Gabrillagues 55) Tries: Vahaamahina, Ollivon, Vakatawa Conversions: Ntamack (2) Red card: Vaahamahina\n\nYet, soon after, out of the blue, they were gifted a way into the contest. French captain Guilhem Guirado spilled the ball going into contact in midfield and Aaron Wainwright picked up the loose ball. The flanker then demonstrated a stunning turn of pace to scorch away from the cluster of defenders around him and away to touch down, for a try converted by Biggar.\n\nWhen the Wales fly-half added a penalty in the 20th minute, it appeared that his side were gradually seizing the initiative, but then they lost it again.\n\nNavidi had to go off injured, Moriarty came on and was only operational for a minute before being sin-binned for a high tackle on Fickou.\n\nFrance immediately capitalised on the numerical advantage. From the promising platform of a lineout in the Welsh 22, on the left side, Guirado bulldozed his way forward. The attack swung right then back across the field, Ntamack picked out Damian Penaud's inside line and the wing off-loaded to Vakatawa, who held off Wyn Jones and stretched to score.\n\nAgain, Ntamack converted and France were nine points in front. They could have extended their lead before half-time, but scrambling defence by George North and Alun Wyn Jones prevented a try, before Ntamack saw another penalty hit a post and stay out.\n\nAfter the break, Camille Lopez emerged in place of Ntamack and soon the Clermont Auvergne stand-off was lining up a drop goal, only to send it wide to the right. Then came the moment of madness from Vahaamahina which left Wainwright with a sore jaw and his own team with 14 men. Despite the howls of protest from French fans, the offender knew he could have no argument.\n\nBut France soon blew a huge chunk of their 12-0 lead when Wainwright broke through to score for Wales and it was game on\n\nWainwright is congratulated by his Wales team-mates after his 12th minute try brought a much needed early response\n\nWales' back row Moriarty (left) was sin-binned after making a high tackle on France's centre Gael Fickou in the first half\n\nA 54th-minute Biggar penalty brought Wales back to within a score of their European rivals, but France came again \u2013 seemingly fired up by a collective sense of injustice. They hurled themselves forward on a driving rampage before Vakatawa arced right and gave a slick pass which Penaud was unable to hold, close to the Welsh line.\n\nIn contrast, Wales were struggling to produce those magic moments, to unlock the Gallic defence. However, with 15 minutes to go they launched a sweeping raid as Wainwright burst down the right and nifty footwork by Tomos Williams took the replacement scrum-half into the opposition 22.\n\nBut Gatland's men couldn't finish what they had started. An overlap beckoned on the right but North's lofted pass was well cut out by Huget and France clung on again.\n\nBut, amid dramatic scenes, they were unable to cling on until the end. Moriarty went over with six minutes to go, Biggar converted, Wales ran down the clock and escaped to victory. They will enjoy their good fortune, then begin to prepare for a second World Cup semi-final in the space of eight years.\n\nFrance took advantage of Wales going down to 14 men just before the break when Vrimi Vakatawa went over for their third try", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN OITA: Wales recovered from a nightmare start to book a place in the World Cup semi-final after pulling off a second-half comeback to see off an ill-disciplined France side.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/10/19951632-0-image-a-57_1571562929633.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
