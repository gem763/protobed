And the fact they can do that is brilliant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting an understanding of it all. It\u2019s hard to explain what it feels like until you\u2019ve been in the position.\n\n\u201cSo for players that haven\u2019t been in that position before that can be something that you can dwell on, or possibly it can blindside you if you haven\u2019t prepared for it.\n\n\u201cBut our boys looked really good, they looked like they played open and free.\n\n\u201cAnd for me it was the same as watching the English, they are another team that really rose to the occasion and embraced it.\n\n\u201cYour team echoes your coach\u2019s persona, so if he\u2019s able to stay cool and calm and deliver clear messages in the heat of battle then the players go out and reflect that.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes if it\u2019s the opposite then that\u2019s what you see out on the field.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s seventh World Cup quarter-final exit in nine tournaments has spelled the end for Kiwi boss Joe Schmidt, who has relinquished his head coaching role to take a break and spend time with family.\n\nSchmidt led Ireland to their first two wins in history over New Zealand, three Six Nations titles including one Grand Slam and maiden wins in Australia and South Africa.\n\nThe World Cup quarter-final sticking point leaves just one itch Schmidt could not scratch in his six years at Ireland\u2019s helm, but Mealamu insisted that will not dent the 54-year-old\u2019s CV.\n\nMealamu in fact insisted Schmidt will still be on the All Blacks\u2019 radar as a future coaching option.\n\nAsked to appraise Schmidt\u2019s time in charge of Ireland, Mealamu said: \u201cOh my goodness, to be the first Ireland coach to beat the All Blacks, and for Ireland to beat them twice, I don\u2019t think you can put anything past that.\n\n\u201cYou just have to say that and look at how long the Irish and All Blacks have been playing, it was huge to get those wins.\n\n\u201cAnd the rugby they have been playing, that\u2019s a huge feat for both Joe as the coach and Rory as the captain as well.\n\n\u201cHis record speaks for itself, it\u2019s just that one of the hardest things to do is get your timing right to peak at a World Cup. Because there are so many other things that you need to achieve in between.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got the pedigree to coach the All Blacks. Warren Gatland is coming back as well, and when you look at them as coaches, what they\u2019ve been able to do with other teams has been amazing.\n\n\u201cI know both of them pretty well and they are both really good people.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the main reasons why they have done so well, and that puts them in the frame.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand face England in the semi-final next weekend.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/02/wire-19972952-1571620437-336_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
