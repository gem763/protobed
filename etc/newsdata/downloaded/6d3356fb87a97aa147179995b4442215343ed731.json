( CZZ ) was upgraded today to a 'Buy' by TheStreet.com's quantitative service. CZZ is a fully integrated company in the renewable energy and infrastructure segments in Brazil. It produces sugar and ethanol and distributes fuels through a network of service stations.\n\nI remember the name from years ago when everyone was looking for ethanol plays. Let's check out the latest charts and indicators.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of CZZ, below, we can see that prices have more than doubled in the past 12 months. CZZ is trading above their rising 50-day moving average line and the bullish 200-day line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OV) line shows a smooth rise the past year to confirm the price gains.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator turned up again above the zero line for a buy signal not unlike the buy signal in May.\n\nIn this five-year weekly bar chart of CZZ, below, we can see the uptrend from the lows in 2015 in the $3-$2 area. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is overall bullish the past four years and the MACD oscillator is poised to turn higher for a new buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of CZZ, below, we can see a longer-term price target in the $21 area.\n\nBottom line strategy: CZZ has a bullish set of charts and indicators and a quantitative 'Buy' recommendation. Sounds like a triple threat. Approach from the long side on available weakness near $14, risk below $13 looking for $21 longer-term.", "description": "Let's check the latest charts and indicators....CZZ", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Cosan Could Rally Further With Strong Charts", "A Quant Recommendation", "Let'S Check The Latest Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "James", "Rev Shark", "Carolyn Boroden", "Chris Versace"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a8e84aed-2de0-11e8-8afc-7fa4f606b807.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
