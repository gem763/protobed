(AP) \u2014 Severe weather, including a probable tornado, struck eastern South Dakota leaving a trail of damaged buildings, downed power lines, fallen trees and some reports of injuries, officials said Wednesday.\n\nFire Chief Brad Goodroad said at an early morning news conference Wednesday that at least 37 structures collapsed in Sioux Falls or have structural issues following the storm that struck just before midnight Tuesday. There were no reports of any fatalities.\n\nNational Weather Service lead meteorologist Todd Heitkamp in Sioux Falls says surveyors will work with the light of day to confirm a tornado caused the damage. Heitkamp says most damage likely was caused by strong straight-line winds.\n\nSioux Falls schools delayed classes Wednesday as crews worked to clear debris, and city officials in Sioux Falls urged citizens to stay off the streets until 8 a.m.\n\nAmong the buildings sustaining damage was Avera Behavioral Health. The storm ripped off part of the hospital\u2019s roof and caused significant damage to the building\u2019s windows, according to Avera spokeswoman Michelle Pellman.\n\n\u201cSeven Behavioral Health patients have been transferred to the Avera Heart Hospital,\u201d Pellman said. \u201cOnly one patient suffered an injury and it was non-life threatening.\u201d\n\nThe Avera Heart Hospital also had damage to its lobby and windows, but all patients are safe, Pellman told the Argus Leader. She said people should stay away from the area because of flooding and debris concerns.\n\nBusinesses that sustained damage included an Advanced Auto Parts store where a wall collapsed. Kohl\u2019s and Best Buy lost part of their roofs and Pizza Ranch suffered heavy damage.\n\nXcel Energy says as many as 25,000 customers were without power at one point because of the damage, but that number dropped about 2,100 customers by 6:30 a.m.\n\nThe Red Cross opened a shelter at the Sioux Empire Fairgrounds\u2019 armory for people displaced by the storm.\n\nSioux Falls, with an estimated population of 187,200, is located about 240 miles (386.kilometers) southwest of the Twin Cities in Minnesota.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Severe weather, including a probable tornado, struck eastern South Dakota leaving a trail of damaged buildings, downed power lines, fallen trees and some reports of injuries, officials said Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/severe_weather_83826_c0-62-2000-1228_s1770x1032.jpg?68369c376ffcd05575f5972365d8c5ccbb2b1eea", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
