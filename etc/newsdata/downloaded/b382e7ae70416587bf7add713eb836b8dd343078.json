Normalised earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 0.4% to 5.4%.\n\nRevenue per paid patient day (PPD) increased by around 5.9%, and the southern Africa business had an \u201cexcellent\u201d second half of the year, with per paid patient days growing by around 1.8%, after shrinking by 0.3% in the first half, the group said.\n\n\n\nIts profit margin has declined as it invested in growth initiatives and due to operational challenges with the delivery of radio-isotopes in the UK which increased costs.\n\n\n\nIts international revenue grew by between 10.0% and 13.2% thanks to strong growth in PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography \u2013 Computed Tomography) scan volumes in the UK, the impact of the acquisition of Italian diagnostic imaging clinics during the second half of the year, an acquisition of scanning facilities in the UK and a solid underlying performance in Ireland. The 4.2% depreciation of the rand against the pound over the year also contributed to the revenue growth.\n\nBy late morning, its share price was down 1.7% to R24.23.", "description": "Its international revenue is expected to grow by more than 10%.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2870/eafa868ed71140aabc068af58be9a758.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
