Photo: Vulture\n\nThis post is updated frequently as movies leave and enter Netflix. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nAs the world continues to fall apart, don\u2019t you just want to something to make you laugh? Netflix is becoming the country\u2019s biggest source for a laughter after a long week at work, but it can be hard to find exactly what you\u2019re in the mood for when you log on to the service. So we\u2019re here to help. (And for more public service announcements, check out our regularly updated lists of the 100 Best Movies on Netflix and the 50 Best TV Series on Netflix.)\n\n50/50\n\nMore dramedy than comedy, there are still enough funny beats in this tearjerker to qualify. Will Reiser tells his own story of battling cancer in a tender, genuine film that ended up being a sizable box office hit given its subject matter. People were attracted to the truth in Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u2019s performance as a young man diagnosed with cancer, and how that diagnosis impacted his relationships, particularly one with a good friend, played by Seth Rogen.\n\nAbout a Boy\n\nThere\u2019s been a bit of a reappraisal of Hugh Grant\u2019s acting ability in the last year with his great work in Paddington 2 and A Very English Scandal, but his career-best work may still be in this adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel about a man-child who learns how to grow up from his friendship with a kid.\n\nAbout Time\n\nThe romantic comedy genre has been in a dire state for many years now, but Hollywood occasionally produces a clever twist on the stale formula. Take this Richard Curtis (Yesterday) movie that features Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams at their most charming. Gleeson plays a man who can travel back in time, and uses that ability to alter his romantic future, learning that it\u2019s better to accept life one day at a time with all of its imperfections.\n\nAs Good As It Gets\n\nSpeaking of Oscar-winning comedies, believe it or not, this is the last movie to win both the Oscar for Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) and Best Actress (Helen Hunt). James L. Brooks\u2019s romantic comedy is a perfect example of a movie that caught its cast at just the right moment, getting one of the last Nicholson performances that could be called charming and supporting it with great work from Hunt and Greg Kinnear.\n\nBurn After Reading\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen followed their Best Picture winner No Country for Old Men with one of their most cynical and hysterical movies, a comedy of errors about some incredibly stupid people. Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, George Clooney, Richard Jenkins, John Malkovich, and J.K. Simmons star in a movie that\u2019s basically about, well, a bunch of total idiots. No drops an F-bomb like John Malkovich.\n\nCaddyshack\n\nOne of the most quotable comedies of all time makes its way to Netflix to encourage young subscribers to watch movies made before 1990. This one definitely has some funny dialogue and one-liners, but it\u2019s also a phenomenal example of how far casting can go to make a classic comedy. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield weren\u2019t just hysterical here, they were all perfectly cast to play off their comedy reputations. Most of all, it\u2019s still damn funny.\n\nChasing Amy\n\nKevin Smith\u2019s best film is also one of his most personal, the story of a man who falls in love with a lesbian and destroys his friendship in the process. Smith has never been better than he is here at capturing believable, funny human relationships, and he gets his best acting work of his career as well from Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, and Jason Lee. It won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay for a reason.\n\nCloudy With a Chance of Meatballs\n\nAnother family movie! This adaptation of the famous kids\u2019 book by Judi and Ron Barrett completely expands on the world of its source material to tell the story of an inventor (voiced wonderfully by Bill Hader) who unleashes a storm of food. The character design here is clever and the script is very smart, written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who went from this to make a little flick called The LEGO Movie and produce Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. They know a thing or two about great cartoons.\n\nDon\u2019t Think Twice\n\nMike Birbiglia directs, writes, and stars in one of the smartest movies ever made about improv comedy. He\u2019s a member of a group of comedians in New York City who watches as one of them becomes famous \u2026 while the others do not. How even jealousy impacts friendship is smartly examined in this funny, empathetic movie that also stars Gillian Jacobs, Kate Micucci, and Keegan-Michael Key.\n\nEddie Murphy: Delirious\n\nThere are dozens of stand-up specials on Netflix, and at least half of them owe a huge debt to a pair of \u201980s comedy films starring Eddie Murphy, Delirious and Raw. There was a time when Murphy was literally the hottest stand-up comedian in the world, and one of many things so mind-blowing about Delirious is that he was only 22 when he made it! There is a buzzed episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee in which Jerry Seinfeld talks to Eddie Murphy about a potential stand-up comeback. Watch Delirious to see why people are so excited about this possibility.\n\nThe Edge of Seventeen\n\nGreat comedies about those harrowing days of late teenage life, especially from a female perspective, are few and far between. So it\u2019s a shame that more people didn\u2019t see this one with Hailee Steinfeld, Haley Lu Richardson, and Woody Harrelson. It\u2019s truthful, hysterical, and anchored in reality in a way that most of the movies don\u2019t even try to be.\n\nEmpire Records\n\nRemember record stores? This movie may not be classically great, but it\u2019s a wonderful time capsule of mid-\u201990s culture, a time when it was cool to hang out in record stores all day. It\u2019s also got a great ensemble, including Liv Tyler, Robin Tunney, Renee Zellweger, Ethan Embry, and Rory Cochrane. It\u2019s fun and will play differently for those of you who grew up with music stores as a part of their lives than it will for the iGeneration.\n\n*Four Weddings and a Funeral\n\nRemember when romantic comedies weren\u2019t basically the exclusive territory of Netflix Original movies? It\u2019s hard to believe now, but Mike Newell\u2019s Four Weddings and a Funeral was a legitimate phenomenon, grossing more than any U.K.-produced film in history at the time of its release and earning an Oscar nomination for Best Picture! Why was it such a hit? A lot of the success of great rom-coms comes down to casting, and Newell got Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell at their most absolutely charming.\n\nFrances Ha\n\nGreta Gerwig got a lot of deserved attention for Lady Bird but it wasn\u2019t her first semi-biographical screenplay, and maybe wasn\u2019t even her best. She co-wrote this quarter-life crisis comedy with director Noah Baumbach, in which she stars 27-year-old New Yorker Frances Halladay. It\u2019s one of those films that doesn\u2019t have much of a plot but works because of the genuine, empathetic way it approaches its leading lady, a character who feels both incredibly specific and yet universally relatable at the same time.\n\nGoon\n\nMichael Dowse\u2019s 2011 hockey comedy is a great sports movie about finding your ideal role in life. It made hardly anything in theaters but found an audience at home (so much so that they\u2019ve already made an inferior sequel). Seann William Scott stars as Doug Glatt, a sweet but kinda dumb guy who becomes the tough guy on a hockey team. You know, the one who starts and finishes most of the fights. It\u2019s funny and surprisingly sweet with Scott\u2019s career-best work.\n\nThe Graduate\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how culturally impactful Mike Nichols\u2019s The Graduate was when it was released in 1967. And it\u2019s equally remarkable to think how much this movie still connects with audiences a half-century later. It\u2019s both a document of when it came out, down to its music and fashion, and a piece of work that taps into themes about those hazy days after college that will be forever timeless. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s regularly listed as one of the best films of all time.\n\n*Groundhog Day\n\nRelive one of the best comedies of all time over and over again on Netflix. Believe it or not, this 1993 Bill Murray vehicle wasn\u2019t rapturously received either critically or commercially when it came out, but it has become a beloved genre classic. Murray stars as a weatherman forced to repeat the same day over and over again until he gets it right. It\u2019s not just the clever premise but how much Murray and director and co-writer Harold Ramis inject humanism and truth into it. And it holds up so much better than most early-\u201990s comedies.\n\nThe Hangover\n\nOne of the true sleeper smashes of the modern era, The Hangover remains the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time. What was it about this 2009 movie that tapped into the cultural Zeitgeist? The setup was relatably simple in a way that could easily be pitched to friends and families: Three idiots can\u2019t remember what happened on a crazy night in Vegas. Sometimes that\u2019s all you need.\n\nHeathers\n\nPeople love to talk about \u201cmovies that could never be made today\u201d as if that\u2019s some criticism of the modern state of comedy. The truth is that comedy has always shifted and changed to reflect the times. However, one has to wonder if this dark comedy about murders at an average high school could get to the screen in 2019. With peak-of-their-charisma performances from Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, Heathers has an edge we don\u2019t see that often anymore, and it has things to say about teen life that still resonate. There\u2019s nothing more dangerous than high school.\n\nIn Bruges\n\nLong before he directed Frances McDormand to an Oscar for Three Billboards, Martin McDonagh wrote and directed this pitch-black 2008 comedy starring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as a pair of hit men stuck in purgatory, a.k.a. Bruges, Belgium. McDonagh\u2019s dialogue is razor-sharp, but it\u2019s the performances from Farrell and Gleeson that really make this comedy deadly.\n\nThe Incredible Jessica James\n\nThere are not a lot of great Netflix Original comedies (sorry, Adam Sandler fans) as the company has focused more on sci-fi and drama in its first few years of nonstop production. One of the exceptions is this Sundance hit, a great vehicle for Jessica Williams. The former Daily Show correspondent stars as the title character, someone trying to find happiness and love. She\u2019s charming and delightful in a movie that not enough people have seen.\n\nThe Informant!\n\nIt could be argued that Steven Soderbergh\u2019s character study of the man who blew the whistle on lysine price-fixing in the \u201990s isn\u2019t exactly a comedy, but it\u2019s close enough to make the list. It\u2019s certainly quirky and odd, and contains one of Matt Damon\u2019s most inspired, unforgettable performances. The success of Soderbergh\u2019s Netflix Original High Flying Bird is likely going to lead people to some of his earlier works. Hopefully they find this one.\n\nThe Interview\n\nRemember the movie that almost started a war? It was actually pretty funny. The drama leading up to the release of The Interview, a movie that made Kim Jong-un so mad that he ordered a hack of Sony and threatened terrorist attacks against multiplexes, understandably overshadowed the actual movie. The truth is that while it\u2019s not perfect, The Interview contains some inspired work from James Franco, and a great supporting turn from Randall Park as Kim. Go ahead and watch it. North Korea will never know.\n\nKicking and Screaming\n\nNoah Baumbach, who would go on to make several films on this list (Frances Ha, While We\u2019re Young), made his directorial debut with this 1995 comedy released when the filmmaker was only 26. It\u2019s a great ensemble with fun, youthful energy and has a theme that Baumbach would return to over the years: young people struggling with responsibility and getting older. Trivia: It was also the first producing credit for Baumbach\u2019s college roommate, a young man named Jason Blum.\n\nKung Fu Hustle\n\nYou have likely never seen a movie quite like this 2004 martial arts comedy, Stephen Chow\u2019s masterpiece. Set in 1940s China, this worldwide hit features some of the best stunt work you can find on Netflix, all in service of a movie that often plays like a live-action cartoon. It\u2019s ridiculous and unforgettable.\n\nThe Land of Steady Habits\n\nNicole Holofcener is one of the most underappreciated writer-directors alive, even if she did just earn an Oscar nod for co-writing Can You Ever Forgive Me? You simply have to see Enough Said, Lovely and Amazing, and Please Give. Her latest stars Ben Mendelsohn as a man deep in a mid-life crisis that comes from the realization that he\u2019s not as important as he thought that he was his whole life. It\u2019s not as good as some of her best work, but minor Holofcener is still worth a look.\n\nThe Little Hours\n\nThere\u2019s a movie on Netflix that features Aubrey Plaza as a profanity-spewing nun and you haven\u2019t watched it yet? Jeff Baena\u2019s Sundance hit also stars Alison Brie, Dave Franco, John C. Reilly, Molly Shannon, and Fred Armisen in a ridiculous, raunchy retelling of The Decameron. It\u2019s reminiscent of classic Mel Brooks in the way it skewers classical storytelling structures with modern comic sensibilities.\n\nThe Lobster\n\nComedy doesn\u2019t get much darker than this 2015 offering from the 2019 Oscar-nominated Yorgos Lanthimos. The Greek director co-wrote and directs the story of a place where single people go to hook up with others looking for love. The catch? If they don\u2019t find a partner within 45 days, they are turned into animals. As dry and deadpan as comedy gets, there are still some very funny beats in Lanthimos\u2019s exaggerated look at the folly of human connection.\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of Monty Python specials and movies on Netflix, but this remains arguably the career peak of one of the most beloved comedy troupes of all time. A parody of tales like those of the Knights of the Round Table, Holy Grail is one of the most heavily quoted movies of all time, a comedy that feels like it\u2019s playing in some theater somewhere in the world, probably at midnight, every single day. Its popularity simply never recedes.\n\nMonty Python and the Life of Brian\n\nHoly Grail may be laugh-out-loud funnier, but it\u2019s arguable that Life of Brian is actually smarter. Monty Python\u2019s most controversial movie stars Graham Chapman as Brian Cohen, the neighbor of Jesus Christ. It\u2019s an incredibly smart film that caused quite an uproar when it was released due to accusations of blasphemy. Modern comedy could use a little more blasphemy every now and then.\n\nMr. Mom\n\nLong before he was Batman or Birdman, Michael Keaton was Mr. Mom in one of John Hughes\u2019s most beloved \u201980s scripts. Watched through a modern lens, Mr. Mom is remarkably dated in its handling of gender issues, but it remains a funny snapshot of the battle of the sexes from over three decades ago, and contains a committed physical performance from Keaton.\n\nMr. Roosevelt\n\nNot every movie on a list like this should be a smash hit, so we\u2019re digging a little deeper for this South by Southwest hit starring the delightful No\u00ebl Wells of Master of None and Saturday Night Live. She also wrote and directed this story of a young lady returning to her hometown and dealing with some unresolved issues regarding her ex-boyfriend, now with a new partner. Wells is charming and funny.\n\nNick & Norah\u2019s Ultimate Playlist\n\nPeter Sollett directed this adaptation of Rachel Cohn\u2019s hit novel with sweet, likable performances from Michael Cera and Kat Dennings as the title characters. It\u2019s one of those films that succumbs to a dozen or so clich\u00e9s of the rom-com genre, but you just don\u2019t care because you enjoy watching the couple at its center have the craziest night of their life. Sometimes that\u2019s all you need.\n\nObvious Child\n\nJenny Slate should be a household name. She\u2019s always charming, has great comic timing, and seems to find new dramatic registers with each outing. This remains her best overall film and performance, the story of a stand-up comedian who has to deal with a few of life\u2019s unexpected curveballs. Shorthanded as \u201cthe abortion comedy,\u201d there\u2019s more to Obvious Child than just that brief description allows. It\u2019s smart and genuinely likable \u2014 things that aren\u2019t often said about what could be called a rom-com.\n\nObserve and Report\n\nJody Hill\u2019s brand of humor isn\u2019t for everyone but if you watched Eastbound and Down and have yet to see this then you\u2019re doing something wrong. Similar to that show, this pitch-black comedy is about an aggressive idiot, played here by Seth Rogen as a mall cop who goes to extremes. In your face in every way, this is the kind of movie that either really works for you or really doesn\u2019t. Find out on which side of the aisle you fall.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop\n\nYes, that Paul Blart. No one is here to argue that this Kevin James hit is on the same level as Caddyshack or Animal House but sometimes you just need a really stupid physical comedy to wash away the concerns of the day. And Paul Blart gets that job done. James is an underrated physical comedian and he works perfectly as a mall cop who stumbles onto a hostage crisis at his job.\n\nPineapple Express\n\nDavid Gordon Green\u2019s stoner comedy is often written off as, well, just a stoner comedy. That\u2019s not really fair because this is a razor-sharp script with perfect comic timing by Seth Rogen and especially James Franco, who has arguably never been better. Yeah, we said it. This is one of those comedies that still works viewing after viewing. And you don\u2019t have to be high to love it (but it doesn\u2019t hurt).\n\nPretty in Pink\n\nNetflix knows that a lot of their paying subscribers grew up in the \u201980s, and so there\u2019s a ton of classic films by people like Steven Spielberg and John Hughes, who wrote this cult classic, a film that really defined a generation in terms of music and fashion, and helped launch the Brat Pack. It\u2019s not a great movie as much as a great time machine, a way to revisit 1986 in all its pain and glory.\n\nResults\n\nAndrew Bujalski\u2019s Support the Girls got a lot of buzz last year, even winning some awards for its great central performance from Regina Hall. If you liked it, check out Bujalski\u2019s last film, another movie about a very unique working environment. Cobie Smulders, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Corrigan star in this quirky rom-com set in the high-pressure world of personal trainers.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World\n\nMichael Cera stars in Edgar Wright\u2019s vibrant adaptation of Bryan Lee O\u2019Malley\u2019s graphic novel, a movie that feels like it could come out exactly the same way today, almost a decade after its release. Wright\u2019s style is perfect for this material, capturing the tone and structure of the source material with his razor-sharp editing and wit.\n\nSet It Up\n\nWhen Set It Up hit Netflix in the Summer of 2018, it felt like a splash of cold water for one reason: the rom-com is in a dire state. They barely get released in theaters at all any more, and they\u2019re typically awful when they do. So to see an old-fashioned, charming romantic comedy felt like something new again. It also helps that Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell have future stars written all over them. They\u2019re charming and delightful \u2014 two things we wish we could say about more rom-coms in the past decade.\n\nSnatch\n\nThere are enough exaggerated characters and broad humor in Guy Ritchie\u2019s second film to qualify it for this list. The story of bookies, gangsters and boxers gets so ridiculous that it almost approaches a kind of \u201ctough guy slapstick\u201d if you think about it. You may want to use Netflix\u2019s subtitles feature for some of the heavy accents.\n\nStarsky & Hutch\n\nBefore he made a fortune with The Hangover, Todd Phillips directed this adaptation of the hit TV series from the \u201870s, turning the action show into more of a physical comedy. It\u2019s not a classic comedy, but it\u2019s fun to watch now to see so many great comedians near the peak of their abilities, including Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the title roles, and supporting turns from Vince Vaughn, Jason Bateman, Terry Crews, and the one and only Snoop Dogg.\n\n*Stripes\n\nWe still miss John Candy. His co-starring work here is only one of the great things about this near-perfect comedy, a flick that caught Candy, Bill Murray, and Harold Ramis at their charismatic peaks. Murray is at his sad sack best as a man who gets knocked down by life and decides to join the Army. Comedy hijinks ensue. A lot of comedies from the early \u201880s have not aged well. This one has.\n\nSwingers\n\nEvery few years, a comedy comes completely out of nowhere and taps something in the Zeitgeist that makes everyone involved a star. No one knew who Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn the day before Swingers came out, but it launched them into the celebrity sphere, where they still reside. This movie is still money, baby, as it captures the posturing of young men trying to get work and get laid in Hollywood in the mid-\u201990s.\n\nSwiss Army Man\n\nThere are a lot of movies on Netflix. There are not a lot of movies like this Sundance hit. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, along comes Daniel Radcliffe as a farting corpse. The former Boy Who Lived stars with Paul Dano in a film that can\u2019t really be captured in a tiny list entry. Just watch it and report back.\n\nThe Trip to Spain\n\nMaybe you haven\u2019t heard of The Trip franchise? Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan play barely fictionalized versions of themselves, traveling to different places around the world as they deal with their own personal problems and eat really well. This is the third movie in the series after 2011\u2019s The Trip and 2014\u2019s The Trip to Italy. They\u2019re worth a look just for Brydon\u2019s perfect celebrity impressions.\n\nWet Hot American Summer\n\nDavid Wain\u2019s ode to teen camp movies didn\u2019t find much of an audience at all when it was released and critics mostly hated it, but it became a word-of-mouth cult classic over the years. Audiences took to it so much on DVD and cable that it even returned for a revival series on Netflix. See where it all began at Camp Firewood way back in 2001.\n\nWhile We\u2019re Young\n\nLook, another Noah Baumbach movie! When Netflix launches movies by auteurs, they often include a lot of their older films in the catalogue, and so the inclusion of The Meyerowitz Stories means a lot of old Baumbach. This 2014 comedy may not be his deepest work, but it\u2019s one of his funniest, with likable, perfectly tuned performances from Ben Stiller, Naomi Watts, and Adam Driver.\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno\n\nSometimes it\u2019s fun to watch what could be a mediocre movie get totally carried by the charms of its two stars. That\u2019s the case here. Is this a great comedy? Not really, but Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks are so delightful and fun to watch that you just don\u2019t care.", "description": "The best comedy movies on Netflix include Wet Hot American Summer, the 40 Year Old Virgin, Hot Fuzz, and more.
