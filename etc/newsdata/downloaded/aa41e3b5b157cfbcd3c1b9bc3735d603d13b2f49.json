Wanting to leave a legacy behind and feeling you had an impact on club and country and to be remembered.\n\n\u201cThat is the main aim \u2013 to win as many trophies as possible and go as far as possible in tournaments.\n\n\"I won the Champions League in the summer but it is the same as if you have not won a trophy. You want to do it more often.\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\u201cThat determination and hunger to win never really dies out.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many you win, it will never be enough. You need to keep pushing to get better as a player and as a team, whoever you are playing for.\n\n\u201cThe aim is always to win and that is the mentality I have got at the minute.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool and England right-back is targeting silverware success with club and country ahead of Euro 2020 qualifiers", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Pa", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466921.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-vs-Leicester-City-United-Kingdom-05-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
