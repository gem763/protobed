Amazon.com Inc's (O: ) Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5% share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1%.\n\nStrength in the cloud business powered Microsoft's market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc's (O: ) AWS and Alphabet Inc's (O: ) Google.\n\nMicrosoft beat Wall Street expectations for its overall revenue and its intelligent cloud segment, which contains Azure, marking $33.1 billion in overall sales and cloud unit sales of $10.8 billion.\n\nJefferies analyst Thill said Microsoft's results \"were strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus.\"\n\nBut Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.\n\n\"Azure came in at 59% (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60%,\" he said. \"Other than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it.\"\n\nInteractive graphic on Microsoft's cloud unit: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BzkJ75\n\nMicrosoft also beat expectations in other segments. It forecast sales from a division that includes LinkedIn (NYSE: ) and Office software to range from $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion, in line with analysts' consensus estimate of $11.4 billion.\n\nThe technology company's personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its first-quarter revenue posted on Wednesday, rising 4% to $11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.\n\nWindows results were boosted by 19% revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a 7% decline for consumer PCs.\n\nMike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops.\n\nBut Microsoft forecast current-quarter revenue of $12.6 billion to $13 billion for the personal computing division, below analysts' consensus estimate of $13.38 billion.\n\nNet income rose 21% to $10.68 billion, or $1.38 per share, while total revenue rose 14% to $33.06 billion.
