(AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps)\n\nAfter two weeks of being hobbled with a calf injury, Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert scored his first touchdown of the season on Thursday against the Green Bay Packers.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHe felt like celebrating, and chose to take part in the local custom by doing a Lambeau Leap after finding a cluster of Eagles fans. That wasn\u2019t acceptable for one Packers fan though, and he want out of his way to physically sabotage the Leap.\n\nThe seething, impotent rage of trying and failing to push a 250-pound professional athlete off a wall in the name of protecting the Packers\u2019 precious tradition, now that is sports comedy at its finest.\n\nFunnily enough, Goedert in particular had a reason for going for the Lambeau Leap. Growing up in South Dakota, Goedert was a fan of the Packers as a child.\n\n\u201cMy real dad, he\u2019s a big Cowboys fan. He named me after them,\u201d Goedert said during the 2018 NFL Combine. \u201cMy mom got re-married to a guy who\u2019s a big Packers fan. So when I was like seven or eight I changed to the Packers and have been a Packers fan ever since.\u201d\n\nCongrats to Goedert for fulfilling what might have been a childhood dream, and all the obstacles that come with it.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Eagles' back-up tight end scored his first touchdown of the season.
