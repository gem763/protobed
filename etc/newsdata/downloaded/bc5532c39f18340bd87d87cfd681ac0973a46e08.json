Many of them hoped to impeach Trump by Thanksgiving, but they are unlikely to abide by that timeline.\n\nOn Monday, CNN acknowledged:\n\nHouse Democrats are facing a time crunch to quickly wrap up their investigation into allegations President Donald Trump abused his office in pushing Ukraine to probe his political rivals, prompting growing expectations that votes on impeaching Trump could slip closer to the end of the year. Some Democrats had hoped that a narrow probe \u2014 focused on whether Trump put on ice efforts to bolster relations with Ukraine and provide US military aid to the country until it carried through with a political favor \u2014 could conclude swiftly, with a potential vote to impeach Trump by Thanksgiving. But that has proven to be more complicated than it initially seemed, according to multiple Democratic lawmakers and sources.\n\nCNN listed several reasons for the delay, including having to chase down new leads and the rescheduling of several witnesses, adding:\n\nPlus, there are several more time-consuming steps as part of the probe, potentially trying to bring in big names like former national security adviser John Bolton, then holding public hearings before a report they\u2019re expected to write with recommendations \u2014 all before any votes in the House.\n\nThe New York Times also reported that Democrats are slowing down their impeachment timeline, noting:\n\nHouse Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Mr. Trump. \u2026 After a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale \u2014 and probably more time-consuming \u2014 effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill. Their goal is to convince the public \u2014 and if they can, more Republicans \u2014 that the president committed an impeachable offense when he demanded that Ukraine investigate his political rivals.\n\nSo far, House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe have failed to hold any public hearings. They also refuse to release the transcripts of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the impeachment probe, said he would hold public hearings and release the transcripts but would not say when.\n\nEchoing the House impeachment lawyer, Schiff indicated that the impeachment probe might extend beyond Ukraine, a move that would render the proceedings more time-consuming.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) maintained that Democrats still hope to have the probe completed before Thanksgiving.", "description": "House Democrats' effort to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump is taking longer than they expected, some news outlets reported this week.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/nancy-pelosi-adam-schiff-hands-up-democrats-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
