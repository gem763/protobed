'You've got people's lives in your hands. Because they could have died; my daughter could have died. So yes, I'm very angry.'\n\nQuestions about the mix-up were directed to Community Health Network, which did not reply immediately to DailyMail.com's request for comment.\n\nHowever the company released a statement saying it is committed to patient safety and values relationships and partnerships and 'consider[s] it a privilege to partner with schools including MSD of Lawrence Township.'", "description": "Sixteen students at McKenzie Center for Innovation & Technology in Indianapolis, Indiana, were accidentally injected with a a 'small dosage' of insulin on Monday.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/17/19166320-0-image-a-20_1569949062545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
