REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri/File Photo\n\nThe meeting of foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, the three nations directly affected by the project, will be held in Washington, Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry said, without stating a date or if the other nations had agreed.\n\n\u201cEgypt has received an invitation from the U.S. administration,\u201d the ministry said in a statement, adding, \u201can invitation that Egypt immediately accepted.\u201d\n\nEgypt is worried that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), under construction near Ethiopia\u2019s border with Sudan, will restrict supplies of already scarce Nile waters on which it is almost entirely dependent.\n\nAfter years of three-way talks with Ethiopia and Sudan, it says it has exhausted efforts to reach a pact on conditions for operating the dam and filling the reservoir behind.\n\nEthiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development and has denied that the talks between the three are stalled, accusing Egypt of trying to sidestep the process.\n\nEthiopia will not be stopped from building the dam, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Tuesday.\n\nAbiy, who won the Nobel prize this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, also raised the prospect of conflict over the dam, saying, \u201cIf we are going to war...we can deploy many millions. But war is not a solution.\u201d\n\nEgypt criticised the comments as \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cEgypt ... expressed its shock, great concern and deep regret over comments conveyed by media and attributed to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed,\u201d the foreign ministry said.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to meet Abiy during a Russia-Africa summit this week. Egypt has suggested bringing in an outside party, possibly the World Bank or the United States, to mediate the dispute.\n\nEthiopia has previously rejected bringing in a mediator.", "description": "Egypt said on Tuesday it had accepted a U.S. invitation to a meeting of foreign ministers over a project for a giant hydropower dam on Ethiopia's Blue Nile that is causing an escalating spat between the two African countries.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444029564&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0J7-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
