Local officials confirmed the news.\n\nItaly\u2019s government formally took office on Tuesday, promising a new approach to migration following the hardline clampdown on rescue ships introduced by former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who heads the far-right League.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday that \u201cseveral EU countries\u201d had agreed to take in the Africans aboard the Ocean Viking, but did not give further details and did not immediately let Ocean Viking enter Italian waters.\n\n\u201cWe needed a bit of time, but Ocean Viking has finally been assigned a safe port. Small signs of discontinuity,\u201d said Matteo Orfini, a senior member of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) which has replaced the League within the ruling coalition.\n\nSalvini\u2019s tough line on immigration fuelled the popularity of his League party, which pulled out of its coalition with the 5-Star Movement last month in a vain attempt to trigger new elections.\n\nDuring his 14 months at the interior ministry, he introduced new security decrees barring rescue ships from entering Italian waters, saying Italy had borne too much responsibility for handling African migration to Europe.\n\nShips that defied the decrees risked being impounded and were threatened with fines of up to a million euros ($1.1 million).\n\n($1 = 0.9031 euros)", "description": "Italy's new government allowed a French charity ship to head to the island of Lampedusa on Saturday and bring ashore some 82 migrants, reversing the uncompromising, closed-door policy of the previous administration.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
