The Italy-based multinational Eni calls forest conservation projects a \"pillar\" of their climate efforts.\n\nPer Bloomberg, Eni rolled out plans earlier this year to plant 20 million acres in Africa.\n\nBut, but, but: The majors' investments in climate-friendly projects, business lines and startups remains a very small fraction of their spending on oil-and-gas exploration and production.", "description": "Oil giants are using their venture arms to target companies working to fight climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/KFsLrjAeqPcgoZtjjmFquIgTzJk=/0x137:3875x2317/1920x1080/2019/10/25/1572005730827.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
