Normally I\u2019d call this counter-bluster by the Turks just that \u2014 bluster, empty rhetoric aimed at their domestic audience to show that the strong man Erdogan is willing to laugh in the face of the president of the United States.\n\nBut everything Turkey\u2019s done since the letter was sent suggests that they really did scoff at Trump\u2019s threats. He urged them not to invade; they went right ahead and did so. Trump urged them to cease fire and threatened sanctions. The Turkish offensive proceeded. Yesterday POTUS took to assuring reporters that the Kurds are no angels and that the PKK is worse than ISIS. That is to say, realizing he was powerless to end his humiliation from the Turks\u2019 defiance, he resorted to Turkey\u2019s own propaganda about how the offensive was actually not only necessary but good.\n\nSo why wouldn\u2019t they have also chucked his letter in the garbage?\n\nIt has now been confirmed as genuine by the White House, but soon after the leak on Wednesday, thousands of Turks asked each other on Twitter and WhatsApp whether the letter was authentic or a joke\u2026 \u201cWe just dumped his letter into the trash,\u201d one [Turkish official] said. \u201cThe date on the letter is 9 October, the same day we began Operation Peace Spring. Our president gave the best response by launching the operation on the same day at 4pm,\u201d the official told MEE\u2026 Erdogan earlier this week complained that he doesn\u2019t understand what Trump wants anymore. \u201cWe can no longer follow Trump\u2019s tweets. We cannot track them. There is a stark change in his stance compared to last night,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy did the White House even release this letter? It was a week old when it emerged yesterday afternoon and had already been overtaken by events. The answer, per the Times, appears to come from yesterday\u2019s \u201cmeltdown\u201d meeting at the White House between Trump and Democratic leaders. Pelosi wanted to know why Trump condoned Turkey\u2019s onslaught towards the Kurds. I didn\u2019t condone it, Trump countered, and I have proof \u2014 at which point he asked Kevin McCarthy to pass around copies of the now-famous letter. Once Democrats had it, it was destined to leak. So the White House had no choice but to confirm it.\n\nImagine the look on McCarthy\u2019s face when Trump asked him to circulate the letter, realizing that that would mean the world would soon see it too.\n\nEmbarrassment about the rhetoric wasn\u2019t the worst part. A Turkish expert pointed out that leaking a threatening letter the night before Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo met with Erdogan would risk hardening Erdogan\u2019s resolve to resist U.S. pressure. He\u2019d look weak at home if he bowed to American demands for a ceasefire under any circumstances but to bow after Trump had revealed that he\u2019d warned Erdogan not to be a \u201cfool\u201d would compound the humiliation. Pence\u2019s and Pompeo\u2019s job suddenly got much harder, to the point where Erdogan\u2019s office is now telling reporters that the letter was actually \u201cthe final straw\u201d that convinced him to authorize the offensive in northern Syria.\n\nBut he needs to be careful. Erdogan knows Trump doesn\u2019t care how many Kurds he kills but he will care if Turkey humiliates him personally. He\u2019s a strongman too and needs to project \u201cstrength\u201d to his own base. Erdogan seems to understand that: That\u2019s why he backed off yesterday after initially claiming that he wouldn\u2019t meet personally with the president\u2019s envoys, Pence and Pompeo. Not only did he meet with Pence today, it sounds like they\u2019re having quite a conversation:\n\nPence-Erdogan meeting is still ongoing, approaching 4 hours. \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) October 17, 2019\n\nI doubt he\u2019ll agree to a ceasefire after just eight days but maybe Pence will put something on the table that\u2019ll convince him to scale back operations. What about rescinding the new U.S. sanctions on Turkey? Those probably aren\u2019t going to hurt much and might even boost Erdogan\u2019s popularity among his constituents, but it\u2019s something. If that\u2019s not enough, how about \u2026 a clean bill of legal health in America for the Turkish bank accused of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran? The White House isn\u2019t supposed to interfere with criminal investigations for political reasons but the Trump era is full of novelties.\n\nA simple promise Trump could make in exchange for Erdogan backing off the Kurds would be to veto any additional sanctions on Turkey that might come out of Congress. Lindsey Graham gave a press conference within the past hour threatening such sanctions. Can he get to a veto-proof majority? If not, there\u2019s probably nothing to talk about.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham introduces bipartisan sanctions legislation against Turkey: \"We appreciate what the president did with sanctions against Turkey. We're here to add to it \u2026 We will impose sanctions in the strongest measure possible.\" https://t.co/RbFZav3Dh9 pic.twitter.com/NnR22sYn2b \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 17, 2019\n\nUpdate: Yep, there\u2019s the deal \u2014 all U.S. sanctions go away in return for a Turkish ceasefire for five days. During that time, the Kurds will have to withdraw from the \u201csafe zone\u201d near the border. If they do, presumably the operation\u2019s over.\n\nBREAKING: After hours-long talks Thursday, VP Pence says US and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria; says Turks will pause their operation for 120 hours to allow YPG forces to withdraw from \u201cthe safe zone.\u201d \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 17, 2019\n\nNEW: PENCE says us will not impose any new sanctions on Turkey, and TRUMP will withdraw sanctions put in on Monday. \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) October 17, 2019\n\nHopefully that means the killing is finished, but if the deal holds it\u2019ll also mean that Turkey\u2019s mission was a success. They wanted the Kurds cleared out of the border area; the U.S. is now politely asking the Kurds to comply with that demand in return for the guns falling silent until next week. What do the Kurds do?\n\nUpdate: It sounds like Erdogan\u2019s going to get everything he wants here, a territory cleansed of Kurds, and he\u2019ll get it without having to risk the lives of any more Turkish troops. Even better for him, if the Kurds refuse to retreat, Erdogan can then start shooting again and claim that it\u2019s the Kurds who are defying the United States now, not him. I hope the Kurds are onboard here.\n\nBIG \u2013 #Pence confirms that the full #YPG withdrawal will be taking place in a territory 20miles (32km) deep. If enacted (unclear), that's the maximalist demand originally set by #Erdogan. However this is spun, it's a huge concession from the #Trump admin/US government. pic.twitter.com/bfVRZbsgH3 \u2014 Charles Lister (@Charles_Lister) October 17, 2019\n\nUpdate: Turkey is insisting that this isn\u2019t a ceasefire. It\u2019s more of a \u201cyou have five days to get out of Dodge\u201d demand to the Kurds.\n\nTurkish FM \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu just now: \"We will suspend the Peace Spring operation for 120 hours for the PKK/YPG to withdraw. This is not a ceasefire.\" \u2014 Piotr Zalewski (@p_zalewski) October 17, 2019\n\nUpdate: This is in fact how the \u201cdeal\u201d appears at this hour. We\u2019ll see how the Kurds react.\n\nPence thus confirms it. So the YPG have to give the ground? It's basically Turkey = mission accomplished via US diplomacy rather than guns. https://t.co/7GiLOTmYPu \u2014 Tom Rogan (@TomRtweets) October 17, 2019", "description": "\"Our president gave the best response by launching the operation on the same day at 4pm.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
