In the book, the investigative journalist portrays top NBC executives as playing down a rape allegation against former Today host Matt Lauer and caving to pressure from Harvey Weinstein to quash an expose on decades of sexual misconduct claims.\n\nBut the NDA release may not mollify the rank-and-file, some of whom have expressed disgust with NBC\u2019s handling of the Lauer and Weinstein situations by NBC News Chairman Andy Lack and news division President Noah Oppenheim.\n\nOne senior NBC News employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told The Daily Beast after Maddow\u2019s show aired that management\u2019s offer was \u201ca cynical attempt to shut the story down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all still pissed about how Noah and Andy have handled this. There has been no accountability,\u201d the employee said.\n\nMaddow herself alluded to the uproar inside 30 Rock, saying, \u201cIt would be impossible for me to overstate the amount of consternation inside this building.\u201d\n\nAri Wilkenfeld, a civil rights attorney who has represented a number of former NBCUniversal employees, was underwhelmed by the network\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThe language is vague and intimidating. Given the company\u2019s conduct to date, I\u2019m not sure how many people are going to feel comfortable reporting to NBC and asking permission to tell their stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see if NBC is truly interested in reconciling with its past and present problems.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit group Silence Breakers Alliance, which works to root out sexual harassment in the workplace, said the network\u2019s statement was \u201cnot enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company should not make any former employee, specifically women, go begging on their hands and knees back to NBC to be released from an NDA. Women have already been through hell with this company. Instead, here\u2019s what NBC should do: issue a blanket statement simply releasing from NDA\u2019s all current and former NBC News / MSNBC employees who have information regarding sexual misconduct, retaliation, silencing or coverups. Because it\u2019s not just the harassment, it\u2019s everything management does to enable perpetrators and harm victims,\u201d a spokesperson told The Daily Beast.\n\nA growing chorus of former NBC staffers have publicly criticized the network\u2014mostly anonymously\u2014over allegations made in Farrow's new book, with many questioning why the network didn\u2019t order up an outside investigation into Lauer.\n\nWhen Lauer was fired in 2017, Lack said he was canned in response to the \u201cfirst complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years\u201d he worked at the network. But Farrow has alleged the network knew of multiple allegations against Lauer before action was taken, with \u201cmultiple secret settlements and nondisclosures\u201d used to keep the allegations under wraps.\n\nNBC News has pushed back against Farrow\u2019s claims, with Oppenheim sending a memo to staff accusing the Pulitzer winner of an \u201ceffort to defame\u201d the network.\n\n\u201cIt is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies,\u201d Oppenheim said earlier this month.\n\nNBCUniversal said in a statement late Friday that it has \u201ctwo agreements with women relating to complaints of sexual harassment by Lauer \u2013 both entered into after his termination \u2013 and both women are free to tell their stories about Lauer.\u201d", "description": "The offer is widely seen as an effort to control damage from allegations in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book.", "authors": ["Allison Quinn", "Lachlan Cartwright", "News Editor", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2986,w_5310,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572055715/GettyImages-93525422_aydhdt", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
