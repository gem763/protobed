For weeks the Prime Minister has been asking for a General Election to break the Brexit deadlock, and now there\u2019s every chance his dearest Christmas wish could come true. Until now, he\u2019s run into two obstacles \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn and the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. Mr Corbyn has twice refused to vote for an early election and, without his support, the Prime Minister has little hope of clearing the two-thirds majority the Act requires and getting an election on December 12. Tomorrow Mr Johnson will have another go, but Labour MPs have seen the polls \u2013 including one yesterday putting the Tories 16 points ahead \u2013 and are reluctant, as veteran Frank Field put it yesterday, to be the turkeys voting for Christmas. Unless Mr Corbyn has a dramatic change of heart, he\u2019ll resist and stick to his risible line that he won\u2019t allow an election until No Deal is off the table. Which brings us to the gift handed to the Prime Minister by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalists in the form of an election Bill, which would amend the Act and set the date for the next election on December 9. Crucially, it would require only a simple majority of MPs to pass. Add together the 288 Tory MPs, 35 Nationalists and 19 Lib Dems, and you\u2019ve got 342 \u2013 a comfortable win. The Lib Dems also have nearly 100 votes in the House of Lords, which could prove useful if peers decide they want to stand in the way of an election. In making their offer, the two minor parties are not trying to help Mr Johnson, but are acting out of cynical self-interest. The SNP are ahead in the polls and keen to secure an election before the trial of their former leader Alex Salmond on charges of sexual assault \u2013 which he denies \u2013 goes ahead next year. Meanwhile Jo Swinson, who has been assiduously positioning the Lib Dems as the anti-Brexit party, will hope to appeal to Remain voters unconvinced by Mr Corbyn. If they vote for the Bill and refuse to back \u2018killer\u2019 amendments such as one extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds, then we could be heading for a December election for the first time since 1923. For Mr Johnson, this could hardly have come at a better moment. In the next 48 hours, EU leaders will decide how long Brexit will be delayed beyond Thursday night. At that point, Leave voters will see that Mr Johnson has failed to fulfil his \u2018come what may, do or die\u2019 pledge of getting us out on October 31. But instead of blaming him, No 10 strategists hope they will blame this obstructive, Remain-dominated Parliament, and look to take their frustrations out at the ballot box.\n\n\u2018If they are going to continue to prevaricate, the next logical choice is obvious.\u2019\n\nThe unlikely pro-election alliance emerged ahead of what is expected to be another dramatic week in Westminster.\n\nWith the clock running down to Mr Johnson\u2019s self-imposed Brexit deadline of October 31:\n\nEU ambassadors were due to meet at 10.30am amid signs they would sign off a Brexit delay until the end of January;\n\nJeremy Corbyn made a humiliating U-turn and abandoned his requests for an election, saying he wouldn\u2019t agree to one even if the three-month extension is agreed;\n\nA poll put the Tories 16 points ahead of Labour on 40 points;\n\nLabour peer Peter Mandelson said Labour would never win a majority with Mr Corbyn in charge, and;\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby faced a backlash after he suggested Boris Johnson and other MPs were pouring \u2018petrol\u2019 on a divided UK with their rhetoric.\n\nThe idea of a short Bill to set an election date in stone has been discussed by Mr Johnson\u2019s aides in recent weeks.\n\nBut it was thought to be vulnerable to amendment by opposition parties demanding votes for 16 and 17-year-olds.\n\nThe publication of a carefully drafted proposal caught No10 offguard. In a sign of her seriousness, Miss Swinson said there wasn\u2019t time for any such amendments.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t spoken to Boris Johnson\u2019, she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u2018But if he is serious about wanting an election and if he\u2019s genuine about having an election before Christmas, then he can back this Bill.\u2019\n\nThe Bill would only allow for an election once the Brexit delay is agreed, and on a specific date. That, Miss Swinson said, meant No Deal was \u2018off the table\u2019.\n\nLast month Mr Corbyn told the Commons he would support an election if the EU agreed to a three-month Brexit delay.\n\nBut, answering questions from reporters at a Unite union conference in Ayr yesterday, he confirmed a three-month delay until January 31 would not be enough, as No Deal was still in Mr Johnson\u2019s thoughts.\n\nHe added: \u2018No, because it\u2019s still there in his mind, it\u2019s still there in the Bill, and it\u2019s still there as a threat. It\u2019s got to be completely removed before we\u2019ll support an election.\u2019\n\nFormer Labour MP Frank Field told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge that Labour MPs were \u2018pretty sick at the thought of having an election\u2019 and would vote against.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s another hackneyed phrase, but turkeys don\u2019t vote for Christmas,\u2019 he said.\n\nToday\u2019s election motion would need support from 434 out of 650 MPs.\n\nBut, with the backing of 19 Lib Dems and 35 SNP MPs, Mr Johnson would have enough votes to pass the election Bill.\n\nAides said the Prime Minister would propose another election vote tomorrow, leaving Wednesday open for MPs to discuss the election Bill.\n\nThe Government would have to adopt the Bill, giving some flexibility on the exact timings. Any election takes place 25 days working days after Parliament is dissolved.\n\nMandelson: Labour can\u2019t win if Corbyn is the leader\n\nLord Mandelson today launches a brutal assault on Jeremy Corbyn, arguing a Labour government is impossible under his leadership.\n\nThe Blairite peer, who was one of the architects of New Labour and a Cabinet minister under Gordon Brown, also fires a broadside at the party\u2019s \u2018statist\u2019 economic policies.\n\nIn a report, he warns that in government, \u2018Chancellor\u2019 John McDonnell would hand power to \u2018a new generation of trade union barons\u2019 and \u2018reassert the statist mindset that New Labour disavowed\u2019.\n\nLord Mandelson (above) is set to launch a brutal assault on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\n\nBACKLASH OVER WELBY'S RHETORIC RANT The Archbishop of Canterbury faced a backlash yesterday after he suggested Boris Johnson and other MPs were pouring \u2018petrol\u2019 on divisions in the country with their rhetoric over Brexit. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said it was \u2018extraordinarily dangerous for politicians to use careless comments\u2019 in the current climate. While not aiming his comments at any one individual, he made clear he was shocked by the PM\u2019s recent dismissal of complaints by Labour MPs that his language was putting lives at risk as \u2018humbug\u2019. Mr Welby (above) hinted that politicians shouldn't use 'careless comments' The Archbishop, who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum, said: \u2018Death threats are really serious and they need to be taken seriously. All sides need to say, \u201cThat is totally and utterly unacceptable\u201d.\u2019 He said that, in the age of social media \u2018which amplifies things\u2019, today\u2019s political leaders should not use \u2018inflammatory\u2019 words. \u2018In a time of deep uncertainty, a much smaller amount of petrol is a much more dangerous thing than it was in a time when people were secure,\u2019 he added. But yesterday Eurosceptic MPs condemned the Archbishop for his intervention, which came in an interview with The Sunday Times. Tory David Morris said: \u2018The divisions over Brexit are not Boris\u2019s fault \u2013 they reflect the deeply held beliefs of ordinary Britons. I fear these unfair public attacks will add to, and not reduce, tensions in the country.\u2019 Mark Francois, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, said: \u2018The Archbishop is sounding increasingly like a frustrated politician so perhaps he should abandon his pulpit and stand for election.\u2019\n\nBut he adds: \u2018Were it not for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s extremely poor personal ratings \u2013 they make a majority Labour government an impossibility while he remains \u2013 Labour\u2019s prospects would be far stronger than the party\u2019s detractors imagine.\u2019\n\nHis comments come in the foreword to a report by the free market think-tank Policy Exchange, which highlights the dangers of \u2018McDonnellomics\u2019 to the City of London.\n\nThe report examines Mr McDonnell\u2019s plans for the economy and warns they are rooted in the politics of the 1970s hard Left.\n\nIt concludes a Labour government would in a short period undermine investor confidence, damage the tax base and hurt growth.\n\nLabour\u2019s plans for the City would be a \u2018gift\u2019 to financial centres in New York, Tokyo and elsewhere, it says.\n\nThe report\u2019s author, head of economics Warwick Lightfoot, said a McDonnell \u2018experiment\u2019 would hit companies and ordinary people.\n\nMr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell want to bring rail, water, electricity and other utilities back into public ownership, policies that would cost hundreds of billions of pounds.\n\nMr Lightfoot said: \u2018John McDonnell has set out a highly ambitious policy agenda in terms of increases in public spending, taxation, nationalisation, modifications to property rights and employment and industrial relations law.\n\n\u2018This economic experiment would, over time, have a radical and transformational impact on the UK\u2019s economy. But there is much more doubt about how it would benefit businesses and employees.\u2019\n\nThe report was published as it emerged two of Mr Corbyn\u2019s closest allies were at war over whether to back an early election.\n\nKarie Murphy, Mr Corbyn\u2019s new elections chief, wants a poll, and is at odds with Mr McDonnell, who wants to press for a second referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, rebel Labour MPs who want to bring Mr Corbyn down have set up a WhatsApp messaging group called \u2018Clause One\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the party constitution\u2019s opening commitment to be a \u2018political Labour Party\u2019 in Parliament.\n\nThey want to block moves to install hard-Left candidates in the Commons and force Mr Corbyn to quit, The Mail on Sunday reported.\n\nPoll boost for Johnson as Tories extend their lead to 16 points\n\nBLAIR WANTS ELECTION REFERENDUM ON SAME DAY A second Brexit referendum could be held on the same day as a General Election, Tony Blair suggested yesterday. The former Labour prime minister made the comment as he backed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s refusal to support a new election while a No Deal Brexit was still possible. Mr Blair said: \u2018You can deal with them both on the same day if you want. But you should deal with them separately.\u2019 Asked on Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour if he would advocate both votes on the same day, he added: \u2018I\u2019d advocate it if it was the only way of resolving it.\u2019 Mr Blair also said Remain supporters had to accept that No Deal must be on the ballot paper in any referendum. He said a three-option poll \u2013 Remain, No Deal and Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 was therefore \u2018the sensible thing to do\u2019. He also urged Labour to ensure No Deal is fully ruled out by Mr Johnson before agreeing to an election.\n\nThe Tories were handed a major poll boost yesterday as they extended their lead over Labour to 16 points.\n\nAfter a week in which Boris Johnson pulled his Brexit deal and demanded a General Election, his party picked up support at the expense of the Brexit Party.\n\nThe Opinium poll put the Tories up three points and hitting the 40 per cent mark, which has historically been seen as critical for an election victory.\n\nLabour is unchanged on just 24 per cent, the Liberal Democrats were down one point at 15 per cent and the Brexit Party down two points to 10 per cent.\n\nIt is the first time since the Tories missed the original March Brexit deadline that Opinium has them at 40 per cent.\n\nIf he can secure an election before Christmas, Mr Johnson hopes to pick up Leave seats from Labour in the Midlands and North while holding on to marginals from the Lib Dems in the South East and South West.\n\nThe poll, carried out for The Observer, showed growing Brexit fatigue among the public, with 57 per cent saying they believed it would have been better never to have had a referendum. Only 29 per cent thought it was right to hold one.\n\nEU \u2018to sign off Brexit flextension\u2019: Brussels is hopeful a Brexit date of January 31 will be approved after weekend of talks between European leaders\n\nBy David Churchill Brussels Correspondent For The Daily Mail\n\nBrussels is poised to sign off a three-month Brexit extension with the option of leaving by December 1.\n\nAccording to a leaked draft of a proposal being considered by EU ambassadors this morning, Britain would be granted a delay until January 31.\n\nBut the document also lists December 1 and January 1 as potential Brexit days if Boris Johnson\u2019s deal is passed by the Commons before the extension deadline.\n\nSources last night said they were cautiously optimistic the \u2018flextension\u2019 proposal will be signed off by the ambassadors.\n\nIt comes after France refused to agree to the plan on Friday during a fiery meeting in which they were the only member state to block it.\n\nThe document also lists December 1 and January 1 as potential Brexit days if Boris Johnson\u2019s deal is passed by the Commons before the extension deadline.\n\nIt is understood French president Emmanuel Macron has been leant on over the weekend and that due to developments in Britain, including a new Liberal Democrat plan for triggering a General Election on December 9, he is now open to signing it off.\n\nMr Macron\u2019s position has been that a General Election is a good enough reason to grant an extension.\n\nBut last week he was not convinced one would happen, partly due to Labour failing to say whether it would back one in a Commons vote today.\n\nIt is understood a side declaration to be published with the extension decision will make clear Brussels expects Britain to nominate and send a UK Commissioner after October 31.\n\nMr Johnson previously said Britain would stop sending one after October 31 \u2013 the day he said Brexit would happen.\n\nAccording to a draft, the declaration also states no major changes can be made to the Prime Minister\u2019s deal.\n\nIt says: \u2018The European Council firmly states that it excludes any reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement in the future and recalls that any unilateral commitment, statement or other act by the United Kingdom should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement.\u2019\n\nEU Council chief Donald Tusk has been in intensive discussions with EU leaders over the weekend.\n\nHowever, member states could still hold off making a final decision abut the extension until tomorrow morning, and until it is formally signed off the terms could change.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson could get a Christmas general election.
