In it, Brady initially seemed to pull a troll job on his team\u2019s owner, Robert Kraft.\n\nBrady vehemently denied that he was making fun of Kraft, who has faced legal issues involving charges of solicitation of prostitution. Those misdemeanor charges were in connection with an investigation of massage parlors in South Florida. Kraft has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe scene and Brady\u2019s participation in it were \u201ctaken out of context,\u201d Brady told reporters Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that people would choose to think I would ever do something like that about Mr. Kraft,\u201d the quarterback said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very bad assessment of my relationship with him. I would never do that.\u201d\n\nThe scene occurs about 10 minutes into the first episode of \u201cLiving With Yourself,\u201d starring Paul Rudd as a middle-aged man who attempts to alter his life trajectory with an expensive spa treatment that produces startling results. When Rudd pulls up to a modest-looking facility, he is surprised to see Brady walking out with a smile.\n\nAD\n\nBefore getting into his vehicle, Brady looks at Rudd and asks, \u201cFirst time?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Rudd replies, and asks, \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cSix,\u201d Brady responds.\n\nOn Saturday, Brady said that the scene was \u201cwritten four years ago\u201d and he agreed to appear in it \u201ca year ago,\u201d before the legal matter involving Kraft.\n\nAD\n\nBrady also said the scene was filmed using a green screen, a claim bolstered by a photo of him and Rudd that circulated online.\n\nBrady discussed the scene after a reporter asked: \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what that was about,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was taken out of context, just like you\u2019re taking it out of context and trying to make it a story for yourself, which has a negative connotation to it, which I don\u2019t appreciate. It was meant to be something different than that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s Tom Brady talking about his Netflix cameo pic.twitter.com/OCd8vzMRK3 \u2014 Mark Daniels (@MarkDanielsPJ) October 19, 2019\n\nTimothy Greenberg, the show\u2019s creator, said recently that he was surprised Brady went ahead with the scene after Kraft was charged, telling Refinery29 that his reaction at the time was, \u201cAlright, this is clearly not going to happen now.\u201d\n\nIn the Refinery29 piece, Greenberg suggested he already had the look of the Netflix show\u2019s spa in mind before the news broke, saying that the spa involved in the Kraft case \u201clooked almost exactly like what we were shooting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Brady was lined up for the show last year, Greenberg explained to the Hollywood Reporter, filming had to be delayed until well into 2019.\n\n\u201cHe was in the middle of his football season, so we had to wait for an actual answer \u2014 and then of course it extended because he won the Super Bowl, so it was an extra six weeks of waiting. But he eventually said yes!\u201d Greenberg said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhy? I guess he wanted to do something with Paul Rudd,\u201d Greenberg added. \u201cI have no idea. I can\u2019t imagine what motivates a god like Tom Brady.\u201d\n\nTom Brady answers questions about his cameo on a Netflix show and he wasn\u2019t happy. pic.twitter.com/WpI7mrfGJy \u2014 Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) October 19, 2019\n\nKraft\u2019s case has yet to be resolved, as prosecutors filed an appeal earlier this month of a judge\u2019s decision to suppress video they wanted to introduce as evidence.\n\nKraft issued an apology in March.\n\n\u201cI am truly sorry,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBrady spoke warmly of Kraft when discussing the Netflix appearance.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows what our relationship is about,\u201d he said. \u201cFor 20 years, it\u2019s nothing but love and respect. I\u2019ve been through a lot of tough things with him. I love him dearly.\n\n\u201cI sympathize with a lot of things that he\u2019s gone through in his life.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The Patriots quarterback vehemently denied that his cameo was meant to troll owner Robert Kraft\u2019s legal issues involving a charge of solicitation of prostitution.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5ITe_cAeeBkbc1-UuaJZn-13s3g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZWIWG3MNVBE2JL2Z6O22A6QTSA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
