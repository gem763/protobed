Asiana had sought a court injunction against the measure.\n\nThe Supreme Court said insufficient staff training was the main cause of the crash and the government's punishment was legitimate.\n\nThe flight ban will be implemented before the end of February, the transport ministry said in a statement.\n\nAsiana would discuss the exact timing of the suspension with authorities, a company spokesman said, adding the punishment would cost it about 11 billion won ($9.3 million) in lost sales.\n\nSouth Korea's transport ministry plans to request other airlines to use bigger aircraft for their San Francisco route during the suspension of Asiana flights, a ministry official said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to media.\n\nKorean Air Lines, the country's top carrier, did not have an immediate comment.\n\nAsiana Airlines shares were virtually unchanged in afternoon trading on Thursday in a flat overall Korean stock market .\n\nAsiana Airlines flight 214 crashed in San Francisco in 2013 when the plane's tail struck a seawall short of the runway, killing three teenage passengers from China and injuring more than 180 out of about 300 people on board.\n\nThe airline, which had outstanding debt of 9.60 trillion won as of end-June, nearly seven times its equity, is struggling with falling travel demand to Japan amid diplomatic tension between Seoul and Tokyo.\n\nIts top shareholder is also looking for a buyer to run the carrier.
