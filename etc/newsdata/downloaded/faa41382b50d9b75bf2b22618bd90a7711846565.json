It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook.

Lindsey Graham, who insinuated that Facebook had become a monopoly during a congressional hearing last year; Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has fingered Zuckerberg as contributing to \u201cthe death of free speech in America\u201d; and conservative radio talk host Hugh Hewitt, who has cautioned against a DOJ enforcement action but has called for a \u201cnew regulatory regime\u201d to minimize \u201cbig tech bias\u201d against conservatives.\n\nCNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, AEI fellow and former Washington Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti, Town Hall editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson, and Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell have also attended the dinners, according to the person familiar with the gatherings. Washington Examiner chief political correspondent and Fox News contributor Byron York also confirmed his attendance but declined to disclose the contents of the dinner because there was a prior agreement that it was off-the-record.\n\nA spokesman for Graham confirmed that the South Carolina senator has spoken with Zuckerberg. Carlson, Continetti, Benson, Bozell and Hewitt declined to comment. Ham and Shapiro did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Facebook, noting Zuckerberg's recent meetings in Washington with Democrats, said in a statement, \u201cFor years, Mark Zuckerberg has met with elected officials and thought leaders all across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nEach dinner has been hosted at one of Zuckerberg\u2019s homes in California, and at least one lasted around two-and-a-half to three hours. The conversations center around \u201cfree expression, unfair treatment of conservatives, the appeals process for real or perceived unfair treatment, fact checking, partnerships, and privacy,\u201d the source familiar with the meetings said.\n\n\"My perception of him was more positive than I anticipated,\u201d this person added, referring to Zuckerberg. \u201cHe was receptive and thoughtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that he wanted to make things right by conservatives,\u201d said another person familiar with the dinners. \u201cI think he\u2019s been genuine in hoping that might happen. Sometimes I think the headwinds are so strong in Palo Alto that I don\u2019t think even he can succeed.\u201d\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has engaged in similar outreach to conservatives in an attempt to gain their trust, and hosted a private dinner in Washington, D.C. with GOP political operatives and commentators in July 2018, according to the Washington Post.\n\nFacebook changed its policies following Russia\u2019s election interference in 2016 in an attempt to halt the spread of false news and foreign-bought ads. But the company has also been working to minimize and correct the appearance of bias in those policies ever since it was reported that the company\u2019s employees may have suppressed stories from right-leaning publications and authors in its \u201cTrending Topics\u201d section.\n\nAs part of those efforts, the company launched a yearlong \u201cconservative bias audit\u201d in 2018, which was conducted by former Sen. Jon Kyl and a team from his law firm Covington and Burling.\n\nKyl interviewed 133 conservative lawmakers and groups for the audit, which ended in August and resulted in changes to its advertising policies. It\u2019s unclear whether the Zuckerberg dinners are another facet of that project.\n\nAllegations that Facebook censors conservatives, however, have gone largely unsubstantiated\u2014conservative publications including Fox, Breitbart, and Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire were among the top publishers on Facebook as of this past May, according to data from the social media tracking firm Newswhip.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 campaign also took advantage of Facebook\u2019s offer to embed employees, who acted as political operatives and provided critical support to the campaign\u2019s social media operations, according to a study released in November 2017. (Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign declined a similar offer.)\n\nFacebook\u2019s critics on the left have argued that the company is overcorrecting and trying to curry favor with the Trump administration as it faces increasing scrutiny over its sloppy privacy practices and potential monopoly in social media. \u201cFacebook made a grave mistake in allowing external political actors to direct an assessment of company policy and practices,\u201d Henry Fernandez, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said after the \u201cconservative bias\u201d audit was completed in August.\n\nThe ongoing talks between Zuckerberg and prominent conservatives have attracted the attention of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which conducts oversight on issues related to telecommunications and consumer protection and is \u201caware\u201d of allegations that conservatives \u201care trying to work the refs\u201d ahead of 2020, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe committee\u2019s Democrats sent a previously unreported letter to Facebook in June, after a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went viral on the platform, asking what the company was doing to address \u201cthe spreading of political disinformation by real accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that you and your company are not taking these occurrences seriously and are grossly unprepared for the 2020 election,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSpecifically, we are concerned that there may be a potential conflict of interest between Facebook\u2019s bottom line and immediately addressing political disinformation on your platform.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s vice president of U.S. public policy, Kevin Martin, responded three weeks later in a letter, also obtained by POLITICO. In it, he said the company has been working with third-party fact checkers to \u201cremove fake accounts, disrupt the financial incentives behind propagating false and misleading information,\u201d and letting users know \u201cwhen they are reading or sharing information (excluding satire and opinion) that has been disputed or debunked.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeading up to 2020 we know that combating misinformation is one of the most important things we can do,\u201d Martin wrote.\n\nBut the social media giant has come under fire recently for its ad policy, which considers politicians\u2019 claims\u2014if made directly on their Facebook page, in an ad or on their website\u2014to be \u201cdirect speech and ineligible for our third-party fact checking program.\u201d In keeping with that policy, Facebook has allowed a Trump campaign ad making false claims about Joe Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine to remain on the platform.\n\nWarren, who has proposed breaking up Facebook, Amazon, and other tech giants, tested the limits of that policy last week by releasing an ad making the deliberately false claim that Zuckerberg and Facebook had endorsed Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cIf Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it,\u201d said the Warren ad. \u201cBut Facebook just cashes Trump\u2019s checks. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they\u2019re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable \u2014 add your name if you agree.\u201d\n\nFacebook hit back on Saturday night, likening the company\u2019s policies on candidate speech to that of the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n\u201cThe FCC doesn\u2019t want broadcast companies censoring candidates\u2019 speech,\u201d the company tweeted. \u201cWe agree it\u2019s better to let voters\u2014not companies\u2014decide.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg held a closed-door meeting with half a dozen senators last month to discuss what Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) described at the time as an opportunity for lawmakers to air their concerns about Facebook\u2019s role in American democracy directly with the company\u2019s founder. On that same trip to Washington, Zuckerberg also met with Trump, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House social media director Dan Scavino.\n\nHe is due in Washington next week to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he\u2019s expected to discuss Facebook\u2019s controversial cryptocurrency plans.\n\nAfter this story was published, Zuckerberg posted on Facebook: \"There's some press today discussing dinners I've had with conservative politicians, media and thinkers. To be clear, I have dinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time. Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning. If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do!\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6e/4c/a1b8f5714a89865c78248a5a11f8/20191014-zuckerberg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
