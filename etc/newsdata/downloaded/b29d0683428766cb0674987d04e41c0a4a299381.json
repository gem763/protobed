Sniff, sniff.\n\nPlans call for the aged structure to be demolished in 2021.\n\nUp \u2018til then, though, Dan Snyder has a decision to make, Congress has a decision to make about the site and both should place their bets on a guaranteed moneymaker \u2014 a new home for the Washington Redskins.\n\nMr. Snyder owns the team and is considering leaving FedEx Field in Maryland. Can\u2019t blame him. The team has done so well there, regardless of the coach, top brass and quarterback.\n\nAs for the site, the residents of the city can\u2019t actually do as they please because the RFK site, like much land in this 68.3-square-mile federal city, is owned by the federal government.\n\nAnd as things now stand, the lease to the city mandates that the plot of land on which RFK sits be used for sports and entertainment.\n\nFor sure, it\u2019s a prime location, idle as it is, on the banks of the Anacostia River with a Metrorail station and conveniently located for fans, foodies and sports gamblers to dart in and out on game days.\n\nI know. I know. Wishful thinking.\n\nYou bet it is.\n\nHaving been a neighbor of RFK, a fan of the Redskins, an NFL junkie and a concertgoer, I\u2019m one D.C. taxpayer who has always appreciated other people\u2019s money when it pours into the District. Bring it on!\n\nWhen Walmart said it was looking at D.C., I urged rolling out the red carpet.\n\nWhen Costco said it wanted to open a warehouse and gas station at a D.C.-Maryland junction, I said \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthanks.\u201d\n\nNot because of the brand, mind you. I cheered the potential new neighbors because of a simple mathematical equation: Consumers + disposable income = more D.C. revenue. And, as you know, jobs.\n\nMajor league sports is a bit different. The owners always want and expect their new neighbors, i.e. taxpayers, to kick in some dough, usually via tax credits for the necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe latter, of course, means jobs \u2014 and today\u2019s construction workers don\u2019t carry lunchpails from home as they used to, which means they also are rolling around the city looking for something to grab and go.\n\nThere\u2019s opposition, of course, to the Redskins coming back to D.C. There\u2019s criticism about the team\u2019s name, and there\u2019s advocacy from the city\u2019s newbies, who want a Green New Deal for the RFK. You know, walking and biking trails, small eateries and shops, dog parks and the like. You get their drift.\n\nNone of those could turn the nation\u2019s capital into a destination capital, however. (I shiver every time a Nats game is nationally broadcast and their new stadium, which I helped finance, isn\u2019t rocking with fans. Ditto the NBA/WNBA Capital One Arena.)\n\nWashington is, after all, a football town. A pigskin town.\n\nThe Nationals, Capitals and Wizards try to please, thank goodness. Even the men\u2019s NCAA madness in March pulls in great crowds.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing is an NFL home. On the river. Surrounded by oodles of retail.\n\nOh, there\u2019s even talk about building new affordable housing on the RFK site, and you know what that means. D.C. officials would dip into taxpayers\u2019 wallets to pay for subsidies to make the new housing \u201caffordable.\u201d\n\nThere have been no negotiations between D.C. officials and Mr. Snyder since last summer.\n\nIf Barack Obama can have a beer summit at the White House, D.C. officials, Mr. Snyder and key members of Congress could have a Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl summit at the Trump White House.\n\nThe decisions that Mr. Snyder and Congress \u2014 and, by extension, President Trump and the D.C. Council \u2014 must make can be summed up with one word: M-O-N-E-Y.\n\nOn second thought, make that two words: B-I-G M-O-N-E-Y.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
