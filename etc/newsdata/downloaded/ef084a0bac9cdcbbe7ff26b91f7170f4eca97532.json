Bush, said Trump had \u201ccommitted multiple high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d adding:\n\nWhat is happening when the House refuses to impeach him is that he continues to do more and more of it. And that is what is happening. He is emboldened to continue to violate the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIf Speaker Pelosi doesn\u2019t have the courage to impeach him, he\u2019s going to keep on doing it,\u201d Painter added.\n\nPainter predicted that Trump will claim during next year\u2019s campaign that the lack of impeachment was \u201cproof\u201d he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He also urged the House to quickly vote on articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cAll of the evidence is already there. We don\u2019t need more to impeach this president,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t do it, I think the Democrats are going to lose in 2020 and probably deserve to lose.\u201d\n\nLater on Twitter, Painter said that Republicans will lose control over the Senate next year if they don\u2019t vote to convict Trump.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is OVERWHELMING,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSee his full discussion on the MSNBC panel in the video above.", "description": "The former White House ethics attorney said Trump has \u201ccommitted multiple high crimes and misdemeanors.\"", "authors": ["Overnight Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d89c53b23000059006cd023.jpeg?cache=22bohr45uc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
