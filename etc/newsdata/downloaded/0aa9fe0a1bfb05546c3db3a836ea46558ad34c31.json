I was more worried about being sent off, I was just happy to get away with that one.\u2019\n\nBale says he has to be careful as he is now just one yellow card away from a suspension\n\nBale and Joe Allen are one booking away from a suspension that would rule them out of next month\u2019s trip to Azerbaijan.\n\nWales have never beaten the Group E leaders, and while a breakthrough win would put them in the driving seat to qualify as runners-up, a draw would still be a positive result.\n\nAaron Ramsey is a doubt for Wales and his race to be fit will go down to the wire.\n\nThe Juventus midfielder was left at home and trained on his own in an attempt to relieve a tight abductor muscle in his thigh, but manager Ryan Giggs looks set to wait until the final moment to make the big call on whether to gamble on him.\n\n\u2018We still have time so we will just see how he is in the morning.\u2019 Giggs said. \u2018It\u2019s a choice I have to make.\u2019", "description": "The Real Madrid superstar believes he is now back to his physical peak and playing with a menacing smile on his face as he edges closer to a summer move away from the Spanish capital.", "authors": ["James Candy For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/17/19630746-0-image-a-118_1570898997313.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
