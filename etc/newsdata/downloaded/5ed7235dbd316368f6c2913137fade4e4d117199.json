Hagibis is being compared to a typhoon in 1958 that killed 1,200 people and caused destruction across the Tokyo area and Shizuoka prefecture.\n\nThe death toll from the latest storm is unlikely to be anywhere near as high due to Japan\u2019s stringent building safety standards and comprehensive disaster warning systems. Emergency alerts accompanied by loud chimes are being sent directly to tens of millions of smartphones in the affected areas.\n\nThe centre of the storm is expected to hit Tokyo at about 9pm local time (1pm GMT) on Saturday.\n\nOne person is currently missing in Shizuoka after being swept away by flood water.\n\nBy Saturday morning, roofs had been ripped off houses in Chiba prefecture, which is still recovering from a typhoon last month that killed three people, injured more than 40 and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power.\n\nA local resident told the public broadcaster, NHK: \u201cWhen the winds suddenly hit, they blew the roof off my house. The noise was awful. One of my three children was injured but is now in a hospital.\u201d\n\nA 50-year-old man has died in Chiba after being pulled from a car that had been flipped over by the storm.\n\nAdding to the danger of landslides, an earthquake measuring 4 on the Japanese intensity scale, which ranges from 1 to 7, hit Chiba shortly before 6.30pm on Saturday.\n\nKjeld Duits (@KjeldDuits) #TYPHOON #HAGIBIS IN #JAPAN#Tokyo's #Shinjuku Station now\n\n\n\n5:30 pm on a Saturday evening\n\n\n\nThis is the busiest station in the world with an average of 3.5 million passengers a day\n\n\n\nTokyo has basically shut down the hatches today pic.twitter.com/9aC0SR9hWW\n\nIn addition to the 620,000 people already ordered to move to evacuation shelters, evacuation warnings have been issued to nearly 8 million people. Up to 60cm (24in) of rain is expected in some areas by Sunday morning.\n\nAll fast trains and most flights in and out of the Kanto region around Tokyo were cancelled by Saturday morning, while England\u2019s Rugby World Cup Rugby game with France was cancelled on Friday. A decision will be taken on Sunday morning as to whether Japan\u2019s game against Scotland can go ahead.\n\nTokyo Disney resort shut down on Saturday for the first time since the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2011.\n\nJapan\u2019s meteorological agency issued its highest warning level on Saturday afternoon, urging the more than 45 million residents of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Gunma, Yamanashi and Nagano prefectures to find a secure building or move to higher floors.\n\nTokyo city government has opened an evacuation centre in the Ueno district for tourists stranded by the transport shutdown.\n\nAuthorities in Sagamihara, south-west of Tokyo, said they may have to release water from the Shiroyama dam, which is in danger of bursting. They have warned residents of the area near the dam to evacuate because large-scale flooding around the Sagami River is likely if they discharge the water.", "description": "Tokyo braces for arrival of storm and up to 60cm of rain as flights and trains cancelled", "authors": ["Gavin Blair"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad283b4877d16c18dc27339406979810cf8a149d/0_41_3968_2380/master/3968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff0914db31447e934997b3e3f2728c33", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
