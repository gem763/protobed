Why was she in the bottom two? That's my question.\n\n\"When we have to judge it we do what we feel and it came down to my choice this week. I stand by it 100%.\n\n\"I absolutely adored [Catherine] in past weeks. She did really well. She was just unfortunate this week.\"\n\nThe Strictly judges were also criticised for sending Dev Griffin home despite receiving a staggering score the week before.\n\n\"It's nothing new darling,\" confessed Shirley.\n\n\"It's been going on for 15 years.\"\n\nShirley has no idea who will win the competition with the leader board changing from week to week.\n\nShe added: \"There's so many of them coming through. Each week it changes.\n\n\"There are some spectacular dancers. Everybody is catching up with everybody so it's going to be very unpredictable.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
