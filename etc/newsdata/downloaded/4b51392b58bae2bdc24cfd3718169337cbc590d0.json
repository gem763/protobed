Perfumed air, exotic wallpaper, full-length mirrors - when you've had enough of the bustle, it's like having a rest in a boudoir: a female sanctuary.\"\n\nSusanna went on to tell a personal story about when the ladies came in useful for her.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n\"The Ladies isn't just a convenience,\" she told, \"it's the place I've always gone to give myself a pep talk. One night in my university years, the man of my dreams arrived at the student bar.\n\n\"I was overcome with nerves. What to say to this god (who looked like Aiden Turner in Poldark, now I come to think about it)?\n\n\"I didn't stay to make conversation. I retreated to the Ladies with my girlfriends for a serious discussion. After 20 minutes I emerged, confident and brimming with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Only the toilet paper stuck to my shoe destroyed the image of a calm, collected me. Funnily enough, he wasn't interested.\"\n\nSusanna continued to slam The Old Vic's decision to switch bathrooms to gender neutral is a definite mistake.\n\nShe said: \"But there are fears thus week that the Ladies may be on the way out after London theatre The Old Vic became one of the first to switch to gender-neutral toilets.\n\n(Image: Instagram: @susannareid100)\n\n\"Olivier-nominated actress Frances Barber has joined a growing number of theatre loving women outraged about the new set up.\n\n\"While The Old Vic has put out a statement insisting that the number of toilets available to women has risen from 12 to 24, in fact these are all shared with men - who also have a toilet block with 18 urinals at their disposal.\n\n\"How can that possibly make sense?\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"You wouldn't have thought theatre toilets were central to the audience experience - except they often are for us unlucky women, when we're still stuck in the queue at the end of the interval.\"\n\nSusanna's Good Morning Britain co-host Piers Morgan has a history of clashing with the gender neutral and transgender communities, including a fiery encounter with transgender model Munroe Bergdorf.\n\nThe pair locked horns after news broke that a school in Brighton said that 40 of its pupils do not identify with their birth-assigned gender.\n\nPiers raged: \"Where does this end? Do we end up with literally nobody in the future identifying as male and female?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Munroe replied.\n\nPiers snapped back: \"Why would you be happy with that?\"\n\nMunroe calmly said: \"Some people are trans and that's the fact.\"", "description": "Susanna said that the ladies are 'a female sanctuary' after The Old Vic theatre opted to switch to gender neutral bathrooms", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Instagram", "Itv", "Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20135611.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Good-Morning-Britain-TV-show-London-UK-10-Sep-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
