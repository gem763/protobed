Investors do expect two major players, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, to ease over the next two weeks. But we\u2019re not in the throes of a major financial crisis, or even a downturn in the U.S., though there are pockets of weakness around the world.\n\nThat likely means monetary policymakers aren\u2019t working in considered coordination as much as acknowledging a weary truth: despite the rise of nationalism around the world, our economies and financial systems are now codependent. It\u2019s a reality investors would do well to understand.\n\nMarkets widely expect some sort of easing from the ECB when it meets Thursday, and as of Friday afternoon were assigning a 91% likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates, and possibly announce some additional measures, the following week. With U.S. unemployment near its lowest point in four decades, strong retail spending and markets proving resilient through all the volatility, it may be hard for many investors to understand why.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has changed since 2008,\u201d said Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Management. \u201cBecause of the 2008 crisis, we have to react to low interest rates. And we have an ungodly high dollar because money comes in here to buy our debt. They understand they have to bring rates down to match the rest of the world. Good luck, Chairman Powell, trying to explain that. It\u2019s a political landmine.\u201d\n\nGlobal central bankers may accept that they\u2019re yoked together, according to Forrest, but they may not have come to terms with the reality that they\u2019re out of powder. \u201cAll the stuff that these central banks are doing can\u2019t affect the real economy because of the underlying trade war,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s artificially suppressing economies.\u201d\n\nRelated: Three fund managers may soon control nearly half of all corporate voting power, researchers warn\n\nIn contrast, Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard, thinks the Fed, at least, can have an impact on the U.S. economy. While monetary policy actions and reactions aren\u2019t mechanical, he said, we can expect a short-term interest-rate cut to steepen the yield curve \u2013 that is, to ensure that shorter rates are considerably lower than longer ones, which is good for the banking sector. A rate cut will also weaken the dollar, which is good for the economy.\n\n\u201cEasing of financial conditions steadies the equity market and keeps employment positive, which keeps incomes positive, and people spend,\u201d Blitz told MarketWatch. Blitz initially forecast a 25-basis point cut for September, but after the August jobs report turned out weaker than expected, he said in a research note, \u201cRemembering the headwinds of negative curve, strong dollar, and weak global growth (all interrelated) and that the Fed\u2019s mantra is to push inflation higher and its only means available is running the labor market \u2018hot,\u2019 I think there is a better than even shot of 50-point cut in September \u2013 certainly more than what the market is pricing in.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Blitz said that Fed hawks still will need to be convinced that the rest of the world \u2013 economic expansion and ultra-low rates \u2013 matter to U.S. growth, and he\u2019s skeptical about how readily they\u2019ll embrace that view. But the notion that policymakers are engineering a few surgical \u201cinsurance\u201d rate cuts to allow the economic cycle to continue, rather than starting a new easing cycle, \u201cis a lie, whether they want to admit it or not,\u201d he said.\n\nSee also: Negative-yielding bonds do not mean negative-yielding bond funds\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at an event in Zurich Friday, was more dovish than many analysts had anticipated, though he gave no hints about his thoughts on specific monetary policy moves.\n\nFor Rebecca Felton, chief risk officer for Richmond, Virginia-based RiverFront Investment Group, the key idea is the interconnectedness of world economies. The U.S.-China trade war doesn\u2019t just impact those two countries, she noted, but also their trading partners, such as Japan. She takes the \u201cinsurance cut\u201d notion at face value. \u201cSlower growth isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d Felton said. \u201cThat can extend this bull market by making it more sustainable.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in a note out Friday, economists at CIBC said the global push toward easing will include Canada, and forecast a 25-basis point cut by the Bank of Canada at some point this year. They also nodded to the benefits of a less-expensive currency: \u201cThe export lift from a cheaper loonie will be welcomed, given the limited upside for domestic debt-financed demand, and sluggish growth in major foreign markets.\u201d\n\nU.S. stocks closed out the week higher, even after Friday\u2019s weaker-than-expected jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.26% gained 1.5% for the week, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.17% both rose 1.8%. The benchmark 10-year Treasury notched its largest one-week yield gain since July 12.\n\nWhat does it all mean for investors? Perhaps simply that this is the new normal, and that normal times call for steady investing. Felton\u2019s firm recently turned more defensive in portfolios that have shorter time horizons, but that mostly just meant moving money into U.S. securities from the developed international world. \u201cWe are still fully-invested, risk-on in our longer horizon portfolios,\u201d she said.\n\nBokeh Capital\u2019s Forrest thinks the U.S. is the best house in a bad neighborhood. \u201cWe tell investors to look at good companies, not market timing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a relatively strong economy, with patches of weakness. You have to pay attention to areas that are affected by the trade war, such as agriculture. But retail investors shouldn\u2019t spend a whole lot of time forecasting a recession. Look three to five years out.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s how to play the trade war with ETFs", "description": "The Federal Reserve has cut rates because of a darkening global outlook, which will prompt the European Central Bank to cut rates, which will prompt the Bank...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ854_midnig_ZG_20190906150447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
