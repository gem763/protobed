USA TODAY\n\nThough we do not know their full story, we know their sacrifice.\n\nSHANKSVILLE, Pa. \u2014 As horrific as the 9/11 attacks were, they would have been even worse if not for a heroic group of everyday airline passengers whose remains rest here amid a common field of wildflowers and hemlock groves.\n\nEighteen years ago on Wednesday, radical Islamic terrorists, trained in Afghanistan as part of Osama bin Laden\u2019s al-Qaida network, hijacked four commercial jetliners and aimed them at the emblems of America\u2019s financial and military might.\n\nTwo destroyed the twin towers of Manhattan\u2019s World Trade Center. The third smashed into the Pentagon. And the fourth \u2014 United Airlines Flight 93 \u2014 crashed, upside down, at 563 miles per hour outside this small town, just 20 minutes flying time from the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nLingering questions\n\nWhat was the ultimate target of Flight 93? That remains one of the enduring mysteries of 9/11.\n\nThe authoritative 9/11 Commission report notes that the hijackers had turned the navigation to guide the Boeing 757 toward Washington. But the report is inconclusive about the final destination: The objective of Ziad Jarrah, the pilot among the hijackers, \u201cwas to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic, the Capitol or the White House.\u201d\n\nOn the week of 9/11:The Taliban hardly deserve Camp David talks with a president. What was Trump thinking?\n\nHave we learned more since the report was issued?\n\n\u201cThere is no new evidence so far as I am aware,\u201d Chris Kojm, who served as the commission\u2019s deputy director, tells me in an email. \u201cBin Laden wanted the hijackers to hit the White House. (Ringleader) Mohamed Atta was focused on the Capitol because it is an easy target to find. We really don\u2019t know what Ziad Jarrah and Flight 93 planned to hit.\u201d\n\nA 9/11 memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

But a whole new generation has been born since 2001. The Flight 93 National Memorial serves as both a moving history lesson and a reminder of a time when America was more unified.\n\nThe memorial that enshrines the sacrifice of 40 people\n\nThe first thing you notice about the 2,200-acre site is how quiet it is. Four days before the 18th anniversary, gentle breezes turn the wind turbines in the distance. The mostly clear sky is reminiscent of the deep blue one on 9/11.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on holy ground. It\u2019s goose bumps every time,\u201d says Maryann Brett of nearby Johnstown, Pennsylvania, as she stands on the observation platform, looking out at the crash site and memorial plaza. \u201cThis is peaceful. \u2026 You can\u2019t be divided when you are here.\u201d\n\nAn exhibit inside the visitors\u2019 center relates the story of Flight 93. It tells how the flight took off 25 minutes late because of air traffic delays in Newark, New Jersey. How the four hijackers, seated in first class, took control at 9:28 a.m. over eastern Ohio. How passengers used Airfones to contact loved ones and learned of the other attacks. How, in one heartbreaking recording, a passenger left the code to her safe on an answering machine. How an Airfone operator heard passenger Todd Beamer, who worked for Oracle, tell his fellow flyers, \u201cAre you ready? OK. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d\n\nAnd how, after a desperate struggle, at 10:03 a.m. Flight 93 came down, killing all 33 passengers and seven crew members.\n\nLearning from 9/11: 18 years later \u2014 Terrorism needs to be prevented at the source\n\n\u201cThey made the ultimate sacrifice to help us,\u201d says Craig Sutherly, a first-time visitor from Ada, Ohio, as he stands in front on the Wall of Names. Nearby, a 17-ton sandstone boulder marks the site of impact.\n\nHere in the Laurel Highlands, politics and partisan bickering seem far away. You can\u2019t help but wonder what might have been if not for the courageous actions of the Americans aboard Flight 93. You can\u2019t help but yearn for the sense of unity that fleetingly brought the nation together after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t help but regret that it takes a devastating tragedy to overcome what separates us.\n\nBill Sternberg is the editor of the editorial page.
