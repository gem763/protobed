(David Banks/Getty Images)\n\nFor the second time in two years, an MLB superstar has suffered an injury after slipping on a wet base. Both times, said player was represented by agent Scott Boras, and both times now, Boras has ripped MLB for not doing anything about what he apparently sees as a major issue.\n\nThe latest Boras client to be felled by a wet bag was Cubs slugger Kris Bryant, who suffered a Grade 2 sprain in his right ankle after landing awkwardly on a wet first-base bag while trying to beat out a double play against the Cardinals on Sunday at Wrigley Field. In 2017, the Nationals lost Bryce Harper \u2014 another Boras client \u2014 for more than a month when he slipped on first base against the Giants, suffering a hyperextended left knee and a bone bruise.\n\n\u201cWhat have they done since Harper? The answer is, nothing,\u201d Boras told Gordon Wittenmyer of the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on other factors, economic factors, all things relating to how they can administer the game, and yet the safety of players and resolution of this issue has gone without any attention.\n\n\u201cThe integrity of our game is going to [be] damaged when the safety of players is not at the forefront, and Major League Baseball has dropped the ball on the wet-bag subject.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Boras suggested that keeping the bases dry would not take too much effort.\n\n\u201cIn the NBA, when a player hits the floor and there\u2019s perspiration on the floor, they clean it up immediately so the surface isn\u2019t slick,\u201d he told ESPN after Harper\u2019s injury. \u201cIn baseball, we have no one cleaning the bags between innings during inclement weather. Is there observation as the game goes where they would stop and make sure the bag is dry? We don\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t take measures like that for player safety that could easily be accomplished by the grounds crew and the umpires\u2019 observations.\u201d\n\nNationals General Manager Mike Rizzo and right fielder Adam Eaton agreed with Boras that something needed to be done, with the player comparing the surfaces of the bases to \u201can absolute ice-skating rink.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a bag that holds water on top of it. You shouldn\u2019t have the shiny coating on top of it with water sitting on top of it,\u201d Eaton told The Post in 2017. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the perfect answer is, and realistically, maybe something needs to be done for water. But like I said, that\u2019s just one man\u2019s opinion, and I do just work here, so if they don\u2019t want to change them, they don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nStill, the issue only seems to come up when one of Boras\u2019s clients gets hurt. A Nexis database search of \u201cMLB\u201d and \u201cwet bases\u201d returned only 45 hits, and all but one of them pertained to either Bryant\u2019s or Harper\u2019s problems with the slippery bags (the one outlier among the search results had nothing at all to do with players getting injured by wet bases). This isn\u2019t to say that others haven\u2019t been affected negatively by wet bases, but it only seems to get the media\u2019s attention when Boras brings it up.\n\nThe loss of Bryant, the 2016 NL MVP who\u2019s hitting .282 with 31 home runs and 77 RBI this season, would be a big setback for a faltering Cubs team that\u2019s four games out of the NL wild-card race with six games to play. And while the Nats still won the NL East by 20 games in 2017 even though Harper missed half of August and nearly all of September, the injury may have contributed to his .174 batting average in that year\u2019s NLDS loss to the Cubs.\n\n\u201cThe issue for me is they\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d Boras told the Sun-Times. \u201cThey have completely skirted this issue. They had an MVP player having an MVP season dramatically get hurt and miss time. It affects playoff races and the entire safety of players and the integrity of the game. When they are very diligent to get umpires and teams to play during rain, during precipitation, trying to get the games played.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no discussion, no resolution, absolutely nothing done in this area except the player is to bear the burden of slippery and wet bags.\u201d\n\nRead more on MLB:\n\nPadres\u2019 managerial job will be the plum MLB opening of the offseason\n\nAnthony Rendon\u2019s MVP case is gaining momentum but running out of time\n\nLuis Severino\u2019s return gives the already formidable Yankees an imposing October arm\n\nPirates all-star closer Felipe V\u00e1zquez charged with soliciting a minor", "description": "This year it was the Cubs\u2019 Kris Bryant.
