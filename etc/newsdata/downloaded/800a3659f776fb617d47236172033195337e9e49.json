Feinting forward and initiating with his jab, Masvidal has always had a knack for pulling and returning punches with his opponents.\n\nAt lightweight, the Cuban\u2019s style and available output had him arguably too comfortable at times, costing him crucial rounds in close fights \u2013 fights that many thought he won. That said, we have seen a different iteration of Masvidal since his ascension up the welterweight division.\n\nNow pursuing much more aggressively, Masvidal will mix in his improved kicks off of Thai-style marches. Working well off of his patented left hand, the 16-year veteran asserts himself down the centerline with authority, varying between straight shots to the head or hooks to the body.\n\nMasvidal, who seldom extends himself too far out of position, can be hard to hit cleanly more often than not. However, his comfort in exchanges has shown to cost him both blitzes and counters at times. And despite Masvidal going 6-2 against UFC-level southpaws, he is not beyond being tagged with long left crosses (as we saw in fights with Darren Till, Michael Chiesa and Tim Means).\n\nSure, Masvidal was able to eventually make adjustments and win said fights, but that punch, in particular, is the last strike you want to give Nate Diaz \u2013 a man who can take the steering wheel in a fistfight at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nAnother fighter who came up in an environment where throwing hands were far from foreign concepts, Diaz demonstrates the ability to box with the best of them when it comes to MMA. Under the tutelage of Richard Perez (who is also the boxing coach of Nick Diaz), we have seen the younger Diaz brother steadily sharpen his skills standing.\n\nFiring jab-cross continuums with the snap of a coiled cobra, Diaz will off-set striking rhythms, disrupting a fighter\u2019s timing and subsequent approach. Coupled with unabashed physical taunts and mental warfare, Stockton\u2019s own can sneakily steal the momentum of a fight right out from his opponent\u2019s feet.\n\nAlthough Diaz has been relatively inactive in recent years, he showed us in his last fight that his cult status isn\u2019t the only thing that has been growing.\n\nAgainst Anthony Pettis, Diaz displayed an awareness of the traditional defensive pitfalls associated with his boxing-centric stance, smartly managing distance and switching stances in his approach. Diaz also managed to check kicks a bit more than he typically does, something that proved to be crucial being that he was able to injure Pettis\u2019 foot at the beginning of the second round.\n\nStill, legs kicks or not, it is not unusual to see Diaz take damage in victory or defeat, as his in-your-face style of pressure does not come without its costs. Even though a five-round affair is better suited for Diaz\u2019s slow-burn stylings, he can\u2019t afford to start too slow against Masvidal.\n\nIf he does, then don\u2019t be surprised to see Diaz make things ugly with his underrated clinch warfare in order the level out the playing field. But with Masvidal\u2019s noted wrestling ability, clinch fighting can quickly turn into sticky situations.\n\nNext point of interest: Grappling gambles and savvy scrambles", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom takes a closer look at the UFC 244 headliner between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz.", "authors": ["Dan Tom", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bd-ufc-244-main.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
