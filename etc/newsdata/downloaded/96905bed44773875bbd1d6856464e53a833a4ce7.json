Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal -- are not sustainable in terms of cost and will not \u201cimpact the environment in the way that Democrats have promised,\u201d Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich said Thursday.\n\nAppearing on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d with host Sandra Smith, Pavlich claimed the plans provided by 2020 Democratic presidential candidates will \u201c[overturn] the economy, give more control to the government, and allow the government to regulate almost every aspect of American\u2019s lives by calling it a plan to fight climate change.\u201d\n\nThe plans put forth by Democrats range from former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.7 trillion proposal to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 $16.3 trillion dollar plan.\n\n\u201cThey will not bring down the global temperature. They will not make cars and energy and things like windmills more efficient,\u201d Pavlich stated.\n\nNJ FRESHMAN DEMS PAN GREEN NEW DEAL: 'CAN'T SPEND MY TIME CAUGHT UP IN PIE IN THE SKY'\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll remember, AOC is the one driving this conversation with her Green New Deal. And, her chief of staff admitted that the Green New Deal wasn\u2019t actually about solving the \u2018climate crisis,\u2019 she told Smith. \u201cIt was actually about turning the American economy from a capitalist system to a socialist one where the government is more involved with these kinds of regulations.\u201d\n\nPavlich also discussed President Trump's announcement that he is revoking California's power to enforce more stringent limits on vehicle carbon pollution than the federal government.\n\nThis move is a continuation of the Environmental Protection Agency's fervent efforts to roll back Obama-era regulations.\n\n\u201cWell, look, this sets up another battle between California and the Trump administration,\u201d Pavlich said.\n\nSWING-STATE HOUSEHOLDS WOULD LOSE AT LEAST $70G WITHIN FIRST YEAR OF GREEN NEW DEAL, STUDY FINDS\n\nThe administration\u2019s move seeks to neuter California's resistance to the proposed rewrites of the Obama-era rules that would have required automakers to accelerate the deployment of more fuel-efficient cars and light trucks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe president promoted the move on Twitter, writing: \u201cMany more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because, without this alternative to California, you will be out of business.\u201d", "description": "The Democrats\u2019 climate change proposals\u00a0-- like Rep.
