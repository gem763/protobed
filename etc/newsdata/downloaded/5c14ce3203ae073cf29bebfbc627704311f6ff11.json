It's technical and it all kind of came together at once,\" she said, adding that the New York Fed has been \"behind the curve in trying to estimate how much reserves should be in the system.\"", "description": "For the first time in more than a decade, the New York Federal Reserve Bank on Tuesday pumped billions of dollars into financial markets to keep short-term interest rates in line with the Fed's target range.
