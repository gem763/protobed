That means that these games could all be released sometime between April 2020 and March 2021, so we\u2019ll be waiting a bit longer for them.\n\nGods and Monsters, a cartoony action-adventure game set in Greek mythology by the makers of Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, had been set to release on February 25th, 2020. Watch Dogs Legion, the next game in the Watch Dogs series, which lets you take control of almost any NPC in the game, had originally been scheduled for March 6th, 2020. We didn\u2019t know of a release date for Rainbow Six Quarantine, a tactical co-op shooter, beyond sometime in 2020.\n\nIn a statement, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the delay was to give the teams \u201cmore development time to ensure that their respective innovations are perfectly implemented to deliver optimal experiences for players.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t the only delays we\u2019ve heard about today. Sony announced that Naughty Dog\u2019s The Last of Us Part II has been delayed three months and will now release on May 29th, 2020.", "description": "Ubisoft announced that it\u2019s delaying Gods and Monsters, Rainbow Six Quarantine, and Watch Dogs Legion into its fiscal 2020\u20132021 year.
