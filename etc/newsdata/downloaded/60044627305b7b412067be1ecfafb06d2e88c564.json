Launching on October 31, the German discount store has created an alcohol-free gin for those hoping to indulge in a G+T over the festive period while staying sober.\n\nThe drink, called CeroCero is delicately balanced with notes of juniper, pine and hints of citrus, whilst exotic hibiscus and bittersweet loganberry add a sophisticated finish.\n\nDistilled in Inverness, Scotland, CeroCero is developed through a unique series of cold-press techniques to extract and suspend botanicals, without the need for the addition of alcohol.\n\nIt sells for \u00a39.99 and it's recommended to be served with tonic, fresh berries and crushed ice.\n\nBut with gin enjoying a moment of wild popularity, will fans really be satisfied with a drink that's not the real deal.\n\nNot knowing it was alcohol free, eight Femail reporters tried the gin with some very mixed results...\n\nCLAIRE\n\nI couldn't give this a 5 out of 5 because I'm not a gin connoisseur, but I thought it tasted lovely.\n\nThe drink smelled like candy, and was very floral and fresh, with just the right it of bitterness, and it tasted as good with tonic as it did on its own!\n\nClaire thought the gin smelled like candy, and was very floral and fresh, with just the right it of bitterness\n\nI was shocked to find out it was alcohol free.\n\nI had the full placebo effect and felt quite dizzy for a second, which is ridiculous now that I know there's no booze in it.\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nMONICA\n\nI really liked the sweet flavour at the beginning, but wasn't a massive fan of the slightly sour aftertaste.\n\nI enjoyed it but don't think I would be able to drink a lot, which is probably a good thing.\n\nI was shocked because it had a really strong after taste and had no clue it wasn\u2019t alcoholic.\n\nScore: 3/5\n\nLISA\n\nIt smells lovely and tasted very fruity and light with a good balance of sweet and sharp flavours.\n\nWhen I first tried, thinking it was alcohol, I thought you might need a double serving to taste it alongside the tonic.\n\nI was really shocked to find out it wasn't real booze. I wouldn't have guessed at all because it did taste alcoholic.\n\nScore: 3.5/5\n\nMonica (left) said she really liked the sweet flavour at the beginning but wasn't a massive fan of the slightly sour aftertaste while Lisa (right) thought the gin smelled lovely and was shocked to discover it wasn't alcoholic\n\nHARRIET\n\nI'm not generally fussy about my gins \u2013 and I've got to admit that I found this one pretty tasty!\n\nIt's got a lovely smell that is really enticing, as well as a pretty pink colour which is #Instaperfect.\n\nThe reason it's not a 5/5 is I'm not sure about the after taste \u2013 which is a little bitter for my liking \u2013 but all in all it's a delicious flavour.\n\nI was so surprised to hear this was non-alcoholic \u2013 it really did taste like the real thing. Despite the lack of booze, I\u2019d still give it a go for a G&T. The lovely smell and the taste are enough for me.\n\n4/5\n\nHAYLEY\n\nI really wasn't sure about this gin \u2013 the smell alone was enough to put me off.\n\nIts aroma is quite sweet, but in reality its taste is very citrus heavy, and made me wince like grapefruit does.\n\nThe tonic did take the edge off it, but it enhanced the floral notes and left a dry, lingering taste in my mouth.\n\nHarriet (left) said she found the gin pretty tasty and that the pink colour made it perfect for Instagram while Hayley (right) said the smell of the gin put her off and it left a dry taste in her mouth\n\nI was surprised the gin is alcohol-free \u2013 I never suspected I was being duped for a second. I think its sharp, tart taste makes it very gin-like.\n\nWhen I tried it on its own without the tonic I found it too strong, which also made me assume it was booze-laden.\n\nI almost feel like giving it another mark for its duplicitous skills, but I think I'll stick to my original score based on taste alone.\n\n2/5\n\nBHVISHYA\n\nI'm not really a fan of gin, but was pleasantly surprised with the one I tried.\n\nIt was not too bitter (which tends to be the reason why I steer clear of the spirit) and also had a touch of sweetness about it.\n\nAll in all not bad at all.\n\nI thought it was strangely lacking in the usual bitter taste that gin tends to have, but was sure I has tasted a hint of alcohol. I'm definitely surprised.\n\n3/5\n\nBhvishya (left) said she liked the gin, but was surprised it was alcohol free. Luke (right) thought the tipple smelt like haribo and said he would order it in a bar\n\nLUKE\n\nIt smells like Haribo, or something very sweet when you pick it up.\n\nThere is also a very slight sweet taste before it bounces back to the bitter flavour.\n\nThe drink itself is Barbie pink, which is unusual. It's not bad this drink. Maybe best served in a bar that has something pink?\n\nSarah was very shocked to discover the gin was alcohol free - and said she thought it was more summerty than a winter drink\n\nI was surprised and relieved to find out that it was alcohol free, seeing as I'd drank quite a bit and had to go back to work.\n\nYou definitely would be able to comfortably camouflage with it in a bar\n\n4/5\n\nSARAH\n\nGin is normally my go-to drink, especially on a summer's day, but I found this gin quite sharp.\n\nIt also felt very summery, and less like a drink we should be consuming on the run up to Christmas.\n\nI was very shocked to find out that it was alcohol-free \u2013 you couldn't tell and I wouldn't have known otherwise.\n\n3/5\n\nVERDICT: 27.5/40", "description": "Launching on October 31, Lidl has created a \u00a39.99 alcohol-free gin for those hoping to indulge in a G+T over the festive period while staying sober, but can it fool regular gin drinkers?", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19797556-0-image-a-52_1571244457763.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
