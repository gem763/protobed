Gen. Brian Gibson, director of the Army\u2019s Air and Missile Defense Cross Functional Team, said of the Iron Dome purchase at the Association of the U.S. Army conference in Washington on Tuesday. \u201cWe needed some immediate capability above the tactical level. It was developed for a very specific threat and it does incredible things.\u201d\n\nThe Army has said it will purchase more of the Israeli systems only if it has to.\n\n\u201cAs a long-term enduring solution, absolutely not,\u201d Gibson said of the Iron Dome, calling an additional purchase \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d and opposing \u201ceverything we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe system uses ground-based, non-moving installations around Israeli cities to shoot down short-range missiles.\n\n\u201cWe intend to operate it differently,\u201d Gibson added of the Army\u2019s defense plans. \u201cWe intend to operate it in support of an Army on the move. It\u2019s not just going to be static.\u201d\n\nThe Army has concentrated its primary missile defense program, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability, on cruise missiles and similar larger threats at the expense of defense against shorter-range missiles similar to those defended against by the Iron Dome system.\n\nThe Army built prototypes of its own multimission launcher, which uses AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles to destroy incoming targets, but decided not to advance the research.\n\nThe branch prefers to build its own system of new and existing equipment in the Integrated Battle Command System. Instead of countering the small rockets and missiles plaguing Israeli cities, the system would be a platform to shoot down rockets, artillery, mortars, unmanned aircraft systems and cruise missiles.\n\nIt also requires a timeline of development, officials say.\n\n\u201cI see that more as a near-term decision and recommendation that we\u2019re going to seek to achieve this year,\u201d Gibson said.", "description": "Oct. 16 (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Army does not intend to purchase additional Israeli-made Iron Dome missile defense systems, but may have to, the officer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
