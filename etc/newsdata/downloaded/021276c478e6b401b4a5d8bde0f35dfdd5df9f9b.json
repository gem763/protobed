Cow slaughter is banned in most parts of India and the crime attracts up to seven years of jail term and a fine of up to Rs 50,000.\n\nHowever, banning beef is a critical decision to take.\n\nThe party is unlikely to oppose consumption of beef in the northeast because it is likely not go down well in the region. Beef is a staple cuisine in the northeast.\n\nAlready, cow politics and vigilantism has taken an ugly turn in north India.\n\n\u201cBeef is very important here. All Christians eat it, most tribal communities, valley people eat beef. It is part of traditional diet now. Even the younger generation has taken to it now. The BJP is only trying to regulate the beef industry to avoid illegal slaughter for hygiene purposes,\u201d Manipur Chief Minister Biren Singh said in 2017.", "description": "The 2nd runner up at the Miss Kohima 2019 pageant has an imperative message for prime minister Narendra Modi.
