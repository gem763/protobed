His invention, which now sells thousands of bulbs each month, is a specially designed light that shines with more of the colors that scientists say help you sleep, and less of the colors that keep you awake.\n\nNow, at age 27, the entrepreneur and inventor wants you to close your eyes. But first, he shared lessons with Business Insider in how studying the fundamentals of a problem allows you to create a product that serves as a better solution.\n\nRecognize: Bad sleep is an 'epidemic' \u2014 and a business opportunity\n\n\"Poor quality sleep is basically an epidemic in the US,\" Yeutter said in an interview with Business Insider, citing National Sleep Foundation findings that less than half of Americans report feeling \"well-rested\" on weekday mornings.\n\nThe nation's problem with fatigue is the light wave-obsessed Yeutter's business opportunity. Americans are projected to spend more than $52 billion on sleep-aid devices and substances next year, according to analysis from BCC Research and Consumer Reports.\n\nAnd that number doesn't fully capture the alcohol and other drugs people consume when trying to catch a few winks.\n\n\"We want to solve sleep issues with technology, not drugs,\" Yeutter said. \"That's our mission.\"\n\nHis technology? A better lightbulb.\n\nBedtime Bulb inventor and entrepreneur Greg Yeutter Courtesy Bedtime Bulb\n\nResearch: Understand the problem before designing the solution\n\nYeutter's attributes the success of his Bedtime Bulb to the methodical approach he learned from working in a research lab. Rather than develop a technology and attempt to bend it into a market, Yeutter first set out to fully understand a fundamental human problem.\n\n\"We have thousands of data points about how humans use light,\" he said, adding that those insights are at the very core of his products design.\n\nThrough his study with the dLUX lab, Yeutter saw first-hand how humans respond wakefully to the presence of blue and green wavelengths in light, even when the overall appearance is mostly on yellow and red end of the color spectrum.\n\nEvery light source has a native hue, or color temperature, such as the neutral light of the midday sun, the warm orange of a candle, or the cold blue of the screen you're likely looking at now.\n\nArtificial lights must often be corrected to achieve the desired result, such as LEDs, which typically start with a blue hue and are filtered to match daylight or incandescent bulbs. According to Yeutter's spec sheet, typical indoor bulbs like incandescent, halogen, or filtered LED's still emit two-to-three times the amounts of sleep-disrupting blue and green wavelengths than his Bedtime Bulb does.\n\nThose insights enable Yeutter to differentiate his product from a growing field of LED bulbs, including market leaders like Philips Hue or C from GE, by more fully addressing his customers' needs. The Bedtime Bulb has several trademarked technologies to reduce blue light and widen the preferred spectrum for better color and clarity.\n\nMarket: Build a strong reputation from the start\n\nAlthough you can buy a Bedtime Bulb directly from the company, it's much easier to get via Amazon. And that's as intentional as Yeutter's approach to R&D.\n\n\"We wanted to maximize our reputation on Amazon,\" Yeutter said about his decision to launch his product last year on the platform. \"Customer reviews on Amazon were pivotal.\"\n\nYeutter says he benefitted from the trust that customers have in Amazon, which made them more willing to try out his new product over more established brands due to Amazon's robust payment security and return policies.\n\nOperationalize: Focus on the right team and tools for your business\n\nAlthough Bedtime Bulb is a company of one, Yeutter regularly works with a team of about 10 contractors and a manufacturer in China.\n\nChoosing building his team took significant time and attention, especially to find a factory that could produce according to his business' exacting specifications.\n\nThe escalating trade war with China still hasn't deterred him from sticking with his supplier, even as his tariff costs have increased.\n\nIn addition, Yeutter uses Amazon's fulfillment services, which he says are are worth the high price because of the time it saves him.\n\nAnd remember: Make sure you get quality sleep\n\nAn avid reader (and re-reader) of Tim Ferris' The 4-hour Workweek, Yeutter says he tries always to \"work on the business, not in the business.\" That means keeping a strategic eye on the big picture over the daily distractions.\n\nA major part of that is getting enough sleep.\n\n\"Success is not about sacrificing sleep for work,\" Yeutter said. \"Diet and sleep are more important than exercise to your mental health, especially for entrepreneurs where your thought process is so much of the business.\"\n\nTo improve sleep quality, he recommends using color-shifting apps on your phone or laptop and dimming their brightness to the lowest comfortable level, and adjusting the color and intensity of your rooms light sources.\n\nAnd if you want your lighting to be backed up by scientific research, he'd be happy to sell you some bulbs.", "description": "For Greg Yeutter, the bad sleep epidemic is a business opportunity.
