(Rival Beyond Meat (BYND) burgers are also made of pea protein isolate.) Though the Awesome Burger is GMO free, soy free and vegan, it is not gluten free. It will be available in the fresh meat aisles at grocery stores like Ralphs, Fred Meyer and Safeway. Sweet Earth co-founder Kelly Swette told Yahoo Finance that it is working to get the Awesome Burger in Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores soon.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has been selling a soy and wheat based veggie burger in Europe since April through its Garden Gourmet brand, but the company has long been eyeing its entry into the U.S. market. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Sweet brand aims to deliver the taste and texture of beef yet offer a higher nutritional value without harming the environment or animals.\n\nProduction capacity\n\nNestl\u00e9 is the largest food company in the world, so Sweet Earth is able to tap into Nestl\u00e9\u2019s enormous production capability to meet the intense alternative-protein demand as of late. \u201cOne of the things that is super beneficial to our company is we have 140 years of experience behind us with Nestl\u00e9,\u201d Sweet Earth co-founder Brian Swette said on YFi AM. \u201cSo they have the supply chain, the procurement, the manufacturing expertise that helps us ensure that we can get a great product in a consistent way to all of our customers.\u201d\n\nDespite being owned by a large food company, Kelly Swette explained that Sweet Earth is able to operate independently and even has its own culinary innovation team. She, along with three other people, conceive and produce the Sweet Earth\u2019s products.\n\nAs the plant-based meat craze catches fire mainstream, many people are questioning its health benefits and nutritional value. Some argue that fake meat burgers are too processed to be considered healthy. \u201cBetter is better,\u201d Kelly Swette told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIf you take a look at some of the nutritional aspects, it\u2019s got 26 grams of protein. A hamburger has 19 [grams of protein]. It\u2019s got 6 grams of fiber. Meat [has zero].\u201d Brian Swette added that only about 5% of the population gets sufficient amounts of fiber.\n\nThe Swettes teased that the company would also be launching a line of vegan plant-based deli meats in the near future as well.\n\nCompanies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have been aggressively partnering with food services companies and restaurants to expand their reach. Beyond Meat has partnerships with Dunkin\u2019 Brands (DNKN), Del Taco (TACO), Tim Hortons (QSR), and Carl\u2019s Jr, among a slew of others. Meanwhile, Impossible Foods and Burger King recently launched the Impossible Whopper nationwide.\n\nBrian Swette explained that Nestl\u00e9 has deep relationships within the restaurant industry and an extensive distribution network. He said that Sweet Earth\u2019s intent is to be omnichannel.\n\nSweet Earth was founded by Brian and Kelly Swette in 2011. Both Brian and Kelly have backgrounds in consumer goods, specifically in food and beverage. Brian served as the PepsiCo\u2019s chief marketing officer, sat on the board of Burger King and was director at Jamba Juice. Meanwhile, Kelly was the director of marketing and director of national sales at PepsiCo.\n\nAMS More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
