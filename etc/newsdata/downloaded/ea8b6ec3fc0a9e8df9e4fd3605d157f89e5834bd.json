While not a directional driver, Co-creator of Libra David Marcus responded to critics and said the proposed digital coin does not pose a threat to nations\u2019 monetary sovereignty.\n\n\n\ndropped 1.2% to $10,207.0 by 1:15 AM ET (05:15 GMT.) rose 1.3% to $196.68, while slipped 0.6% to $0.26042. gained 1.2% to $72.227.\n\n\n\nMarcus said in a Twitter thread on Monday he wanted to \u201cdebunk\u201d the notion that Libra puts monetary sovereignty of states under threat, as suggested by France\u2019s Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.\n\n\n\n\u201cRecently there\u2019s been a lot of talk about how Libra could threaten the sovereignty of Nations when it comes to money,\u201d tweeted Marcus. \u201cI wanted to take the opportunity to debunk that notion.\n\n\n\nHe said that the digital coin will be tied to a set of fiat currencies and will be \u201cbacked 1:1 by a basket of strong currencies,\u201d meaning that it is unlikely to be a threat to traditional financial systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis means that for any unit of Libra to exist, there must be the equivalent value in its reserve. As such there\u2019s no new money creation, which will strictly remain the province of sovereign Nations,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nLibra representatives are meeting this week with officials from 26 central banks from the global to discuss the \u201cscope and design\u201d of the cryptocurrency, according to a Financial Times report.\n\nCrypto Mixed; Libra Not a Threat to Sovereignty, Says Facebook\u2019s David Marcus", "description": "Crypto Mixed; Libra Not a Threat to Sovereignty, Says Facebook\u2019s David Marcus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Cryptocurrencies_800x533_L_1556444923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
