Mitt Romney (R-UT) over the former GOP presidential nominee ramping up his criticism of Trump as the Ukraine scandal has deepened.\n\nWith it recently being revealed that Romney had a clandestine Twitter account used for criticizing Trump\u2019s behavior, among other things, Levin took the opportunity to claim that Romney \u201cknown nothing about\u201d the personal lives and behavior of former President Barack Obama or ex-Vice President Joe Biden \u201coutside of what we\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they kept the [John] Kennedy stuff hidden for decades, they kept the [Lyndon] Johnson stuff hidden for decades, they kept the FDR stuff hidden for decades, and his affairs and so forth,\u201d the conservative commentator added, implying that Obama/Biden had skeletons in their closets.\n\nLevin proceeded to go on a largely confusing rant in which he said he wanted to question Romney about the Founding Fathers\u2019 sexual affairs and whether he thought it was right for Franklin Roosevelt to team up with Russia during World War II.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think about that, Willard?\u201d Levin grumbled. \u201cI can go through history, one case after another, about how people are so terribly imperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I will say this about our president,\u201d the pro-Trump host continued: \u201cWhile he\u2019s been president there hasn\u2019t even been a hint of scandal. Not a hint!\u201d", "description": "\u201cBut I will say this about our president,\u201d the conservative blowhard continued: \u201cWhile he\u2019s been president there hasn\u2019t even been a hint of scandal.
