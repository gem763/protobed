REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nLISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese police removed hundreds of climate change activists, mainly from the Extinction Rebellion group, from one of Lisbon\u2019s main streets on Friday evening after a peaceful demonstration earlier in the day.\n\nThroughout the afternoon, thousands of young protesters took over Lisbon\u2019s streets in a climate strike inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nBut, later on, a group of hundreds of protesters holding Extinction Rebellion flags blocked one of the city\u2019s main arteries.
