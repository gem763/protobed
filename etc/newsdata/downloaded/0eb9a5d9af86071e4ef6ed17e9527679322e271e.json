In the last six months, though, DHS officials have routinely promised voters and Trump that they will have 500 miles of border wall fully constructed before the 2020 election \u2014 indicating that the project will need to move at a record pace to be completed in time.\n\nAt this rate, the next DHS chief chosen by Trump must oversee at least 36 miles of completed border wall construction every month from now until November 2020. A failure to do so will break with the president\u2019s promise to voters heading into election day.\n\nThough conservatives are backing Acting United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Ken Cuccinelli for the job, rumors have circulated that Nielsen\u2019s close ally Chad Wolf is in the running for DHS Secretary.\n\nWolf\u2019s background dates back to the early 2000s when he worked in former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, along with Nielsen. From there, Wolf eventually went to work as a lobbyist, representing NASSCOM, a leader in the outsourcing industry that seeks no restrictions on the H-1B visa program, so employers would be allowed to routinely replace their American workforces with imported foreign workers.\n\nBehind the scenes, supporters of the president are looking to a variety of alternatives to Wolf, including DHS official Michael Dougherty, former USCIS Director Lee Francis Cissna, USCIS official John Zadrozny, former ICE Director Thomas Homan, Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan, and former DHS official Katie Gorka.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
