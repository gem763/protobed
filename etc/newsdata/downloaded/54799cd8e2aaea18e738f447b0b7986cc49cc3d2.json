But no one asked you, Karen.\n\nWhen you\u2019re pregnant, every single thing you do comes under scrutiny and your every action takes on a new, moral significance. From choosing to have a glass of wine to carrying your own shopping bags home.\n\nTV personality Lucy Mecklenburgh knows how hard it can be to deal with this level of judgement after facing a barrage of online criticism for posting workout videos online while pregnant.\n\nShe says that while a lot of women have been supportive of her for promoting an active pre-natal lifestyle, other comments have left her really upset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Remarks questioning why I exercise during my pregnancy have cropped up,\u2019 explains the former TOWIE star.\n\n\u2018These have included statements such as, \u201cworking out is selfish, think of the baby before yourself\u201d, or even more radically, one women told me that her midwife said exercise would kill her baby, and questioned if I was worried about this.\u2019\n\nLucy has her own fitness app Results with Lucy, which features thousands of workouts and live classes as well as nutritional and mindset training \u2013 so working out is literally part of her job.\n\nNow she wants to raise awareness about the taboo of working out while pregnant and help promote the health benefits of staying physically active when you\u2019re expecting.\n\n\u2018The comments I\u2019ve had have driven me to help remove the stigma that exercise during pregnancy is dangerous \u2013 it is beneficial for both mother and child. I think it\u2019s a matter of educating women about this topic.\n\n\u2018There are, of course, exceptions when pregnant mothers should avoid exercise: if you have been told by a medical professional that you cannot workout or if you\u2019re experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum (severe morning sickness).\n\n\u2018However, if this is not the case, there is no reason why mothers shouldn\u2019t be encouraged to be active.\u2019\n\nRecent research actually found that vigorous exercise is \u2018safe and healthy\u2019 for women in their third trimester \u2013 that includes jogging, circuits, or interval training on a spin bike.\n\nThe benefits of keeping fit during pregnancy Exercise prepares the body for postural changes by strengthening muscles that may become weak; both abdominal and pelvic floor muscles are strengthened to support labour and post-natal recovery. In general, keeping active helps to maintain, or even improve, muscular strength and endurance to support the demands of pregnancy, labour and being a mum (car seats are very heavy). Other examples include the fact that it reduces backache, increases your vitality, improves your ability to dissipate heat and reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (high-blood pressure during pregnancy). Lucy Mecklenburgh\n\n\u2018Personally, I found it incredibly hard when I couldn\u2019t work out during my first trimester,\u2019 Lucy tells us. \u2018This was due to severe morning sickness and tiredness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The toughest challenges that I had to overcome was the sense of losing my identity and the lack of endorphins, which are mood boosters. Needless to say \u2013 I really missed keeping fit.\n\n\u2018However, I managed to start exercising again around the 12-13-week mark.\u2019\n\nLucy believes it\u2019s sensible to be cautious about exercising when you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nDoctors have now been reiterating for years that exercise is not dangerous for your baby and that cardiovascular exercise can be really beneficial. But everyone is different, and every pregnancy is different \u2013 so it\u2019s worth seeking out personal advice before getting struck in.\n\n\u2018I encourage research prior to prenatal workouts,\u2019 says Lucy. \u2018The blogs and vlogs on my fitness website provide expert advice concerning pregnancy workouts, nutrition and mental health.\n\n\u2018Pre- and postnatal workouts are also included, which feature barre, Pilates, yoga, weights and boxing.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that your body is your business, and carrying another human life inside you doesn\u2019t grant anyone the privilege of telling you what to do.\n\nSensible, doctor-approved exercise is fantastic for pregnant women \u2013 so if you\u2019re facing judgement for having the audacity to jump on a treadmill while with-child, feel free to ignore the haters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: The hottest fitness trends for 2020\n\nMORE: The fitness industry is overwhelmingly white \u2013 and that needs to change\n\nMORE: Costa\u2019s Christmas menu and festive cups are here", "description": "Lucy Mecklenburgh has face online criticism for working out while pregnant, now she wants to remove the stigma of pregnancy fitness.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90135118_1571227764.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
