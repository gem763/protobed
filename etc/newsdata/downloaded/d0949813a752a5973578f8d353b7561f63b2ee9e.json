Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Just hours later, Rockets owner Tillman Fertitta tweeted that Morey did not speak for the franchise.\n\n\"Listen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets,\" he wrote. \"Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\"\n\nListen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets.

Initially in response to a law allowing suspected criminals to be extradited to China, the protests have morphed into a pro-democracy and anti-government movement.\n\nThe chief executive of the semi-autonomous city, Carrie Lam, withdrew the bill last month, but protests have continued and even expanded.\n\nThey have also grown more violent. Earlier this month police fired live rounds at protestors, critically injuring at least one person.\n\nHong Kong was guaranteed a legal system independent of Beijing when it was transferred from British rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" order.\n\nThe Chinese government has hit back against international criticism of its handling of the protests, urging foreign powers to stay out its internal affairs.\n\nThe Chinese media market is crucial to the NBA, and to the Rockets in particular.\n\nThe Houston franchise has been one of the most followed in China since picking Hall of Fame center Yao Ming first in the 2002 NBA Draft.\n\nAccording to a study released last month, the Rockets were the second-most popular NBA team in China by online engagement last season.", "description": "The Chinese Basketball Association has suspended\u00a0its relationship with the Houston Rockets after the team's general manager expressed support for protestors in Hong Kong in since-deleted Friday tweet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/houstonrockets_05212019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
