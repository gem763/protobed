You don't need to know today. It's not going to kill you.\"\n\nCheika will be left wondering what could have been though. Three Christian Lealiifano penalties were added to by Marika Koroibete\u2019s beautiful second-half try, which appeared to knock England momentarily onto the ropes until Kyle Sinckler\u2019s try a handful of minutes later restored the advantage.\n\nBut the Wallabies coach had no regrets over the style of play he implemented at this tournament, even if it did prove a catalyst to their early departure.\n\n\u201cI don't think so at all,\u201d said Cheika in response to whether he got his tactics wrong. \u201cI don't know if we didn't kick. We made a few kicks, one try resulted from that.\n\n\"We gave away two intercepts. They hurt. That is the way we play footy. I am not going to a kick-and-defend game. Call me naive but that's not what I am doing. I would rather win playing our way, that's the way Aussies want us to play.\"\n\nThe defeat will start the fallout of what went wrong for the Wallabies not just in Japan but during what has been a turbulent 12 months, although it did bring down the curtain on a number of players\u2019 careers, including that of flanker David Pocock, and captain Michael Hooper was keen to acknowledge what those players have done for the country.\n\n\"I am gutted, absolutely gutted, for a couple of reasons,\u201d said Hooper. \u201cThere are a lot of players who won't get another chance at a World Cup, some guys have done a lot of work to get into this squad.\n\n\"I certainly feel that weight as well of not being able to get our team across the line. It hurts.\"\n\nCheika added: \"I am feeling very disappointed, obviously. I imagine all Australians will be.\n\n\u201cWe really went into the game looking to play our Australian style of footy, which we did a lot of just not clinical enough to finish off opportunities. England defended very well. Sometimes you have just got to suck that up and wear it, that's life.\n\n\"I want to thank all our fans. We've had great support here and at home. I feel that weight, we should have delivered for them.\"", "description": "An emotional Michael Cheika decided the immediate aftermath of Australia\u2019s record-equalling defeat against England was not the right time to confirm if he has taken charge of the Wallabies for the final time, even though his refusal to change their tactical approach cost them the game.
