InsideEVs, why are you publishing this? That\u2019s not a Tesla truck render. That\u2019s a truck from a video game glitching out.\n\nWhile InsideEVs does qualify this a bit with:\n\nThough this particular render, which comes to us via Erwin at Swerve Designs, isn\u2019t really what we expected the finished product to resemble, it does manage to fully incorporate Musk\u2019s teaser image (see below).\n\nAnd they suggest that it\u2019s based on the teaser image from Elon\u2019s tweet:\n\nAbout a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck pic.twitter.com/hLsGsdyuGA \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 16, 2019\n\nAnd, sure, I guess the front edge of that sort of looks like that, but come on! This was a 3D model of a Ram truck that somebody deleted a bunch of polygons from the front. That\u2019s it.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t count as a \u201crender\u201d of a Tesla truck. That\u2019s insane.\n\nLook, here, I\u2019m going to spend a maximum of ten minutes making a similar \u201crender,\u201d but this time of a future Tesla SUV:\n\nThere. Just as shitty. This shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously, as that truck render shouldn\u2019t.\n\nAs journalists covering Tesla, I know it\u2019s tempting to write about every crazy possible render. But there has to be some kind of standard, right? If not, then, well, fine, because in that case, I can finally show the world this incredible render I found of Tesla\u2019s new electric small car, the Model 4:\n\nStunning, isn\u2019t it?", "description": "I\u2019m not really sure what the hell our pals over at InsideEVs were thinking, but at some point we\u2019ve really got to put our foot down and say that not every fucked-up 3D model of a pickup truck where you remove the grille counts as a \u201cTesla Truck Render.\u201d Look at that image up there.
