She started to drag her feet and walk with a limp, so Ms Rochfort took her back to the GP.\n\nDanielle Rochfort, 26, was told her daughter Charlotte had 'growing pains' and was turned away by several doctors\n\nSeveral x-rays and ultrasounds were taken, and nothing showed any signs of cancerous tumours\n\nThe young mother said the several doctors who turned her away made her feel like she was 'mental'.\n\nBy April, Charlotte wasn't able to get off the lounge and couldn't even walk.\n\nShe collapsed at home and was taken straight to hospital where she was transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital.\n\nCharlotte's first MRI discovered a large mass on her back, three tumours on her brain and multiple other shadows in the three-year-old's head.\n\nShe was diagnosed with Embryonal Tumour with Multilayered Rosettes.\n\n'I'm glad I pushed and kept going because if I accepted that, she wouldn't be here right now,' Ms Rochfort told Seven News.\n\nBy April, Charlotte wasn't able to get off the lounge and couldn't even walk. She collapsed at home and was taken straight to hospital\n\nCharlotte was rushed into surgery to remove parts of the tumour in her spine and take the pressure of her legs.\n\nBut surgeons weren't able to take out the entire tumour.\n\nCharlotte has now finished six months of chemotherapy, but it's still touch and go.\n\n'She was having adult doses of chemotherapy and they wanted to try and kill it off,' Ms Rochfort said.\n\nBut before Charlotte's sixth round of chemo, her tumours started to grow rapidly.\n\nCharlotte's face now droops, and a tumour pushing on the nerves of her brain has forced one of her eyes shut permanently.\n\nShe started radiation therapy last week, but it's too soon for the family to say if it's working or not.\n\nMs Rochfort said Charlotte's condition has started to deteriorate, and noticed her usually happy daughter isn't herself anymore.\n\n'She's changed into a sad little girl in a few months. She knew she could walk before and she can't now,' she said.\n\nCharlotte's first MRI discovered a large mass on her back, three tumours on her brain and multiple other shadows in the three-year-old's head\n\nCharlotte now gets around in a pram as wheelchairs are too big for her.\n\nMs Rochfort and her husband Nick's lives have been turned upside down since their daughter's diagnosis.\n\nThe couple travel back and forth from their home in the Blue Mountains to the children's hospital at Westmead in northern Sydney.\n\nCharlotte's grandmother has taken time off work to help look after Charlotte's sisters, Natalie, six, and Chelsea, four.\n\nA GoFundMe for the family has been created to help with travel costs and treatment for Charlotte.", "description": "Danielle Rochfort, 26, from the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, first became concerned when three-year-old Charlotte complained of pain in her hip in January.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19982362-0-image-a-12_1571647832222.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
