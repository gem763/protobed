Churches, schools and hospitals are off-limits \u2014 but courthouses have always been considered viable jurisdiction for deportation arrests.\n\nICE officials say courthouses are actually a good location to make arrests, since they usually have stiff security and those entering the courthouse probably went through a screening to make sure they don\u2019t have weapons. That reduces the chance for a violent encounter with an unruly illegal immigrant.\n\nICE also said it\u2019s had to turn to courthouse arrests more because so many localities are refusing to turn over illegal immigrants from their prisons and jails.\n\n\u201cICE\u2019s enforcement activities at courthouses are consistent with longstanding law enforcement practices nationwide. And, courthouse arrest are often necessitated by the unwillingness of jurisdictions to cooperate with ICE in the transfer of custody of aliens from their prisons and jails,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nNew York\u2019s lawsuit follows a similar complaint filed in Massachusetts earlier this year. A federal judge in Boston ruled that ICE could arrest migrants at courthouses who were in law enforcement custody, but could not arrest witnesses, visitors or anyone on other official business.\n\nNew York says it can quantify the chilling effects of the Trump administration\u2019s stepped-up immigration enforcement, pointing to drops in calls to immigrant affairs units at the Brooklyn and Nassau County district attorney\u2019s offices.\n\nBut the data the state points to actually undercuts its own case.\n\nThe drops in calls happened happened between 2016 and 2017, but the policy New York is challenging wasn\u2019t announced until January 2018.\n\nIndeed, Nassau County\u2019s calls began dropping during the Obama administration, falling from 82 in 2015 to 51 in 2016, according to data from the ICE Out of Courts Coalition. They tumbled to just three calls in 2017 \u2014 but then rose to eight calls in 2018 \u2014 after the ICE policy was announced.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
