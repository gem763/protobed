This triggered a wave of similar uprisings across the Arab world.\n\nAt least half a dozen countries in the region saw their president fall or conflicts break out in the wake of the former Tunisian leader's downfall, in what became known as the Arab Spring.\n\nBen Ali fled to Saudi Arabia when he left office and was living there when he died on Thursday.\n\nHis funeral will take place on Friday in Saudi Arabia, his lawyer told Reuters news agency.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nObsessive control was his undoing\n\nAnalysis by Richard Hamilton, BBC News\n\nTunisia's autocratic former president brought stability but little freedom to the country.\n\nHe came to power in 1987, ousting Habib Bourguiba to become Tunisia's second-ever president. He promised reform, democracy, women's rights and education.\n\nBut he failed to deliver a more free and open society.\n\nIn a diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks, a US ambassador described how the Ben Ali family was widely viewed as a \"quasi-mafia\". It spoke of a \"nexus of corruption\" which bled the country dry.\n\nAnd while he did bring some economic growth, no-one was really fooled by his three consecutive \"99.9%\" election victories.\n\nHis strict control of society shored up by a vast network of spies, informers and secret police kept Ben Ali in power. But in the end anger against that obsessive control proved to be his undoing.\n\nHe acted too slowly to stem the tide of that unexpected popular uprising.\n\nIn June 2011, a court in Tunisia sentenced Ben Ali in absentia to 35 years in prison for embezzling public money.\n\nIn 2012, he was sentenced to life - also in absentia - over the killing of protesters in the revolution in 2011. A separate court also sentenced him for 20 years for inciting violence and murder.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: A rare look inside Ben Ali's presidential palace\n\nBen Ali's death comes just days after Tunisia held the second free presidential election since he was ousted.\n\nIt was brought forward after the death in July of the country's first democratically elected president, Beji Caid Essebsi, who took office in 2014.", "description": "Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who led the country for 23 years before he was ousted in 2011, was 83.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12D8C/production/_108869177_gettyimages-91750695.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
