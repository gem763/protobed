Meeting to Champion Religious Liberty", "language": "en", "text": "Heads of state will flock shortly to Turtle Bay for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. They have no better opportunity to highlight perhaps the most important human rights issue of our times\u2014 religious freedom.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ought to take concerns over this most basic of human liberties center stage at the U.N. after the 74th session of the General Assembly opens Sept. 17.\n\nOn the agenda in New York is an entire summit on climate change Sept. 23. Few dispute that addressing climate change is a worthwhile topic.\n\nThat said, when politicians gather to discuss the issue they wind up sounding a lot more like politicians than problem solvers, producing paeans of climate orthodoxy mixed with sanctimonious and self-serving speechifying.\n\nNo one will be surprised when Trump rightly decides to skip this Climate Action Summit.\n\nWhat the president should do is organize a sidebar meeting on religious liberty. Let\u2019s be honest, the U.N.\u2019s track record of late has been far less than stellar.\n\nSome nations have promoted \u201cblasphemy laws,\u201d which are little more than cover for suppressing free speech and religious toleration, others an anti-Israel agenda that looks like little more than blatant anti-Semitism.\n\nMeanwhile, an ocean of real-world oppression has been inadequately addressed, from the persecution of Christians in the Middle East to the horrors perpetrated on the Rohingya people in Myanmar and the imprisonment of Uighurs in China.\n\nThis administration hasn\u2019t been shy about addressing human rights issues.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been particularly forceful, persistent, and persuasive. In part, that\u2019s because the president has their back. There is a reason for that.\n\nTrump has no greater exemplar than than Ronald Reagan. On defense, the president has followed the Reagan mantra of \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d On foreign policy, Reagan would be the first to agree with Trump that the president\u2019s job is to put \u201cAmerica first,\u201d protecting our sovereignty and interests.\n\nReagan was also crystal clear that there was good and evil in the world\u2014and presidents make the world better by being champions of what is right in a clear-eyed, realistic manner. It\u2019s not enough to have empathy. It\u2019s more important to actually work to advance human liberty.\n\nReagan didn\u2019t just ask Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. He worked toward that day.\n\nTrump never has been shy about rolling up his sleeves and taking up tough challenges, whether it\u2019s resolving the threat of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons or taking on China over trade.\n\nOn the subject of human rights, no issue needs Trump\u2019s global leadership more than the challenge of preserving and advancing religious liberty.\n\nMany so-called human rights advocates have demoted religious liberty to the second tier. They are much more enamored with causes that play well with progressives.\n\nInternationally, repressive regimes are happy to see the cause of religious freedom sidelined.\n\nEven some of the most liberal states would rather not be bothered, finding the commitment of people to faith somehow quaint, old-fashioned, and out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, other leaders share an unshakable commitment to religious liberty and don\u2019t want to see honest faith banished from the public square.\n\nIn New York, Trump has a unique opportunity to pull these leaders together for a serious conversation. He should take it, and be the bold leader who is willing to mark a righteous path.", "description": "Heads of state will flock shortly to Turtle Bay for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
