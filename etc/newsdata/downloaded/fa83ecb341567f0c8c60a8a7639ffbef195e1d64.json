Now Britain has joined what it said was a US-led \u201cinternational maritime security mission\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is vital to secure the freedom for all international shipping to navigate the Strait of Hormuz without delay, given the increased threat,\u201d said the defence secretary Ben Wallace.\n\nDominic Raab, the new foreign secretary, stressed that the government has not changed its policy to Iran.\n\n1 Is Britain still committed to the same policy?\n\nNo. Boris Johnson has shifted the UK\u2019s stance on Iran away from that of Europe and closer to the Trump administration.\n\nThe government is still committed to maintaining Iran\u2019s nuclear deal and de-escalating the situation, according to ministers. But Iran views Britain\u2019s actions with a lot of suspicion.\n\nRaab, who seems to play a vital role in securing US backing for Brexit, turned his back on his predecessor\u2019s pledge for a European-led taskforce to protect merchant shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe US has enough naval capabilities as part of its fifth fleet based in Bahrain. Britain\u2019s royal navy includes the frigate HMS Montrose and destroyer HMS Duncan.\n\nMany analysts say Britain\u2019s purpose in the US-led initiative is to secure some kind of legitimacy for Trump\u2019s military pressure on Iran.\n\nIran doesn\u2019t like to be cast as a rogue state; its leaders want to be seen as the sole guarantors of security and stability in the Gulf. They seem ready to put the two most strategic assets Iran hold \u2013 the nuclear deal and Strait of Hormuz \u2013 on the line to thwart the US-led mission.\n\nIran aims to link the stepping-up of western military activities in the Gulf to the very existence of the nuclear deal. By threatening to pull out of it, Tehran is trying to force the EU states to keep their distance from Trump\u2019s policy.\n\n2 Will other countries join the US mission?\n\nThis is yet unclear. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, said the US has now asked more than 60 countries to join the coalition. Only Israel has expressed willingness; some western states, including France and Germany, are unwilling; and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, who are the Americans\u2019 closest allies in the region \u2013 are yet to commit. Which makes a coalition of just three.\n\n3 What do the Iranians want?\n\nThey want to assert themselves as the masters of the Gulf waters, and to pressure the US to scale back some of the economic sanctions, especially on the oil sales, since Trump pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and reimposed them on Iran.\n\nMany Iranian officials think the EU signatories to the deal are the only partners capable of keeping the Iranian economy afloat, by delivering the economic implications mentioned in the deal.\n\nIran regards the beefing-up of western military assets on its doorstep as a major strategic threat, and supports the EU\u2019s dull approach towards Trump\u2019s military stints.\n\nEurope doesn\u2019t trust Trump\u2019s intentions, questions the real military objective behind the mission and fears military miscalculations that would result in a major conflict. It still insists that Trump\u2019s initiative goes beyond protecting navigation in the strait.\n\nAustralia became the latest ally to give the plan a wide berth. Ministers there told American counterparts that the request would be given \u201cvery serious consideration\u201d, but stopped short of offering a full response.\n\nThe diplomatic upheaval facing Trump\u2019s administration in its bid to corral its allies reflects its isolation on the world stage, the very strategy Iran is betting on. The US seems ready to do everything possible to end this supposed isolation.\n\nBoris Johnson might be expected to use his affinity with Trump to calm the crisis; instead, he is fuelling it. Johnson regards Trump as the \u201clifeboat\u201d for Brexit; Iran views Europe as the \u201coxygen\u201d to save its sinking economy. The real question in this race: who will arrive to the shore first?", "description": "Continuing his weekly series about the complexities of the Middle East,\u00a0Ahmed\u00a0Aboudouh\u00a0examines international shipping disputes, and whether Britain will join the US naval mission in Iran Britain has joined the US in a naval mission in the Gulf to protect international shipping following tanker seizures by the Iranian military.
