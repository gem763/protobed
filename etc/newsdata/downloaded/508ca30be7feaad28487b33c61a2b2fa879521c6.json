She says The Rock What You've Got cookbook is a great resource for people who want to reduce the amount of food they're tossing in the garbage.\n\nThe recipes were developed with help from culinary arts staff at George Brown College.\n\nOne section of the book is focused on \"fridge clean out.\"\n\n\"I always say I have the best of intentions on Sunday when I'm at the grocery store, but I don't always stick to what the meal plan is. Life gets busy,\" Haines said in an interview. \"I really like those sort of clean out your fridge recipes that allow us to take [the unused items] and try to use them up and good recipes.\"\n\nThe recipes also allow for some versatility in terms of what gets used in the recipe, which means you're not always making the same dish, Haines said.\n\nHaines says the recipes are also meant to be fairly easy, and can be prepared quickly, so families can use them on busy weeknights.\n\nThis is the fifth cookbook being offered through the Guelph Family Health Study.", "description": "Researchers at the University of Guelph have released a new cookbook focused on reducing food waste.
