Now it\u2019s become clear that we must not leave the EU | Martin Kettle", "language": "en", "text": "Though we don\u2019t always admit it, lots of us pro-Europeans have spent the years since the Brexit referendum trying to juggle two essentially irreconcilable views of what should happen next. One is that, awful though Brexit is, the leave vote must be honoured in the least damaging way. The other is that Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union is so mistaken that it must be reversed, once again with least damage.\n\nMore than three years on some of us are still juggling, even as Boris Johnson heads to Brussels. The thing that keeps the juggling alive is not, in the end, an inability to make up our minds. I am a remainer. Full stop. The question is how to respond to Brexit in the political circumstances of the moment, in the best long-term interests of the country as a whole? The answer has evolved. But it will soon be make-our-minds-up time.\n\nBack in 2016 my response to the leave victory was to lament it bitterly but to say that Britain should continue to hug Europe as close as possible, even while leaving. This would help to protect jobs, secure the Irish peace process, and allow Scotland\u2019s remain vote to be treated with enough respect to avoid Brexit becoming a threat to the union. A decade or so down the line, my rationale went, it might then be possible to reopen the question of EU membership, especially if the EU had continued to evolve in a multispeed manner, and if post-Jeremy Corbyn Labour had got off the fence to support Britain\u2019s place in Europe.\n\nBrexit weekly briefing: all eyes on EU summit as deadline looms Read more\n\nInstead, the longer that process has gone on, the wider the gap has grown between the original democratic deference owed to the idea of \u201cleaving\u201d in 2016 and the real-world consequences of the detailed version on offer in 2019. Simultaneously, however, the passage of time has made no difference at all to one very big thing: the concern among many leave voters that what they wanted in 2016 has still not happened. To reconcile these two realities is almost impossible, because it pits the malleable pragmatism of representative government against the rigid mandate of government by populist referendum.\n\nAs the process has lengthened, so the options have widened. This isn\u2019t the conspiracy that some claim to see. It is simply the entropy of politics at work. Few talked about a second referendum back in 2016. But the issue is central to the debate now. Almost no one in 2016, certainly not Johnson, imagined the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all. Today, despite the ongoing talks, no deal is a Johnson government policy option. In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, reversing the 2016 result had few supporters. Today it is the policy of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP and both are prospering in the polls.\n\nThere is no perfect choice to be made on Brexit. The fault with that lies in the way the referendum process was devised \u2013 verdict first, terms later. All the options come with risks, often very big ones. But we don\u2019t solve anything by wishing we could have made better choices at previous turnings along the way. The here and now choice takes two forms. The first is between Johnson\u2019s deal, no deal and remaining in the EU. The other, which applies as much to hardline leavers as it does to remainers, is between folding and fighting on.\n\nThe case for Johnson\u2019s deal is that it means Britain leaves the EU in line with the referendum vote. That\u2019s not a minor civic consideration. People are weary and angry. A deal could draw some of the worst poison from public attitudes to politics. It would satisfy the many (more than some of us want to think) who just want the whole thing over, although in reality almost everything about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU is still to be decided. It might, if you agree with Corbyn, allow a general election to be fought on \u201creal\u201d, that is to say domestic, economic and social issues.\n\nBut it would still be a terrible deal and that can\u2019t be ignored, however weary we are. It would mean buying a pig in a poke and hoping that what\u2019s inside entails a good future for the British people. It would defer rather than solve the Irish border crisis. It would risk breaking up the union. It would instantly worsen the UK\u2019s trading position, with severe short- and long-term impacts on the economy and jobs. It would weaken the UK in the negotiations during the transition period. And it would set Britain at odds with its only true geographic and regional allies.\n\nBrexit: Irish PM hints extra EU summit might be needed because 'many issues' still to be resolved\u2013 live news Read more\n\nThe lesson of the past three years needs to be faced. That lesson is not that politicians are out of touch or failing to listen. It is the opposite. It\u2019s not that the country can get along with Brexit. It is the opposite of that too. The lesson is that Brexit won\u2019t work.\n\nBrexit won the vote. But it\u2019s an ideology not a policy. When its supporters tried to turn it into policies, as they are still trying to do, it fell apart. It made things worse. These three years have been the leavers\u2019 fault and no one else\u2019s. That\u2019s why obstructing no deal has been so important.\n\nBut it\u2019s also why preventing Johnson\u2019s deal is important too. Optimism and slapdash policy will not make Britain a global power. Theresa May was right when she said Brexit means Brexit. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s why, in the end, Britain has to do everything possible to retain its place in Europe, in spite of the difficulties, and persuade its people in a new campaign \u2013 not with a message of fear, but with a message that pro-Europeans are listening to what\u2019s wrong with the country.\n\nIt certainly will not be easy. Most battles are not fought on ground of one\u2019s own choosing. But as long as the passage of time and the sheer folly of Brexit permit the possibility of remaining, Britain should make up its mind to remain.\n\n\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The lesson of the past three years is that the referendum dream can\u2019t be delivered, says Guardian columnist Martin Kettle", "authors": ["Martin Kettle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1bf02d558f95d3f09797fffc01ef1b95b011d8/0_0_4926_2955/master/4926.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e58313b08c9e12fb4f811c8ed165d123", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
