She later went to work for the Internet Research Agency, and made a 2014 trip to the United States to gather information, some Russian accounts suggested, as a way to stay out of trouble with the Russian secret services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe first reports of her detention were made public Tuesday morning. The fact that Belarus, which has a complicated but close relationship with Russia, would act on an American warrant was surprising. Russian media pounced on the story, as did Malkevich\u2019s organization and the Russian embassy in Minsk.\n\n\u201cThis is right,\u201d Malkevich said, \u201cbecause Russian citizens should feel they are protected anywhere in the world from total arbitrariness.\u201d\n\nBelarus relented, he suggested, under the public scrutiny.\n\nThough the embassy was \u201cvery active,\u201d he said, he dismissed the notion that Moscow had brought official pressure to bear. But it was clear that Russia would do everything within its power to prevent her or any other defendant in the election-interference investigation from being extradited to face an American trial.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMalkevich said he suspects that the decision to detain Bogacheva, on an Interpol \u201cred notice,\u201d was made by a low-level official.\n\nNonetheless, the Belarusian government of President Alexander Lukashenko has been wary of too-close a relationship with Russia, and from time to time has made overtures to the West. But from the Kremlin\u2019s point of view, this would be a very high-stakes case.\n\nBelarusian authorities did not comment, except for a statement by the prosecutor general\u2019s office saying there were no grounds to hold Bogacheva on the basis of the American charges.\n\nAccording to the February 2018 indictment, Bogacheva worked for the Internet Research Agency from at least April to July 2014 overseeing its data analysis project, and was one of the co-defendants who allegedly traveled to the United States \u201cunder false pretenses for the purpose of collecting intelligence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe allegedly planned travel itineraries, purchased cameras, drop phones and other equipment for defendants who made U.S. visits, and discussed \u201cevacuation scenarios\u201d and other security measures, according to the indictment. She and three others who applied to the State Department for visas allegedly claimed they were traveling for personal reasons and did not fully disclose their place of employment to hide their IRA connections, the indictment said.\n\nProsecutors said only Bogacheva and co-defendant Aleksandra Krylova, allegedly the plot\u2019s third-highest ranking member, received visas. Between June 4 and June 26, 2014, the pair crossed the United States, stopping in Nevada, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas, and New York to gather information for the plot to interfere in the U.S. political system, the indictment alleged.\n\nSpencer Hsu in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The suspect, Anna Bogcheva, worked for Russia\u2019s \u201ctroll factory\u201d suspected of 2016 election interference.", "authors": ["Will Englund", "Assignment Editor On The Washington Post'S Foreign Desk", "A Veteran Moscow Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lSjKGQpOzcuoWfmmGmYFvwfhnD0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LO6ZEIFOHMI6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
