Informant Extracted From Russia Had Sent Secrets to U.S. for Decades", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Decades ago, the C.I.A. recruited and carefully cultivated a midlevel Russian official who began rapidly advancing through the governmental ranks. Eventually, American spies struck gold: The longtime source landed an influential position that came with access to the highest level of the Kremlin.\n\nAs American officials began to realize that Russia was trying to sabotage the 2016 presidential election, the informant became one of the C.I.A.\u2019s most important \u2014 and highly protected \u2014 assets. But when intelligence officials revealed the severity of Russia\u2019s election interference with unusual detail later that year, the news media picked up on details about the C.I.A.\u2019s Kremlin sources.\n\nC.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia. The situation grew more tense when the informant at first refused, citing family concerns \u2014 prompting consternation at C.I.A. headquarters and sowing doubts among some American counterintelligence officials about the informant\u2019s trustworthiness. But the C.I.A. pressed again months later after more media inquiries. This time, the informant agreed.\n\nThe move brought to an end the career of one of the C.I.A.\u2019s most important sources. It also effectively blinded American intelligence officials to the view from inside Russia as they sought clues about Kremlin interference in the 2018 midterm elections and next year\u2019s presidential contest.", "description": "American intelligence officials had previously tried to extract the source from Russia in 2016, but the informant had initially refused.", "authors": ["Julian E.
