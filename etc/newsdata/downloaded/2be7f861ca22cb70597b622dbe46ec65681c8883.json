They cited his statements since the beginning of the case encouraging settlement so that money for badly needed drug treatment and other services could go quickly to communities hard hit by the opioid epidemic.\n\nWith just two counties \u201cseeking $8 billion in cash for so-called \u2018abatement,\u2019 the Court has determined that it, not a jury, has the discretion to decide how much money defendants may pay to government agencies for medical treatment and other addiction-related services and initiatives,\u201d the drug companies wrote.\n\nPolster could not be reached for comment. A telephone call to his assistant Saturday went unanswered.\n\nLawyers for the more than 2,000 cities, towns, counties and tribal communities suing the drug industry called the attempt to remove Polster a desperate move. The lead plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said in a statement they \u201cremain confident the judiciary will swiftly respond to yet another attempt by the opioid defendants to delay the trial.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs have demanded the drug companies, including manufacturers, distributors and retailers, pay billions of dollars for the damage they allegedly caused. Since 1999, more than 200,000 people have died of overdoses of prescription narcotics, and another 200,000 have died from overdoses of heroin and illegal fentanyl, according to government data.\n\nTwo Ohio counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, are scheduled to begin trial next month as test cases to determine how other plaintiffs and defendants may fare before a jury.\n\nAs of now, they would face off against drug distributors McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and Henry Schein; manufacturers Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceuticals; and retail drugstore chain Walgreens.\n\nTwo law professors called the defendants\u2019 motion unusual and saw little chance it would succeed.\n\nThe law that authorizes large, consolidated cases like this one \u2014 known as \u201cmultidistrict litigation\u201d \u2014 explicitly recognizes that judges would use the opportunity to encourage settlements, said Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond University School of Law.\n\n\u201cJudges overseeing MDLs are supposed to encourage settlement and most MDLs end with settlements\u201d for the majority of plaintiffs, Tobias wrote in an email.\n\nAlexandra Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, agreed.\n\n\u201cIt is a highly unusual motion and not one that I think can win,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI am not sure what the strategy is behind bringing it, and filing on Saturday, other than public relations.\u201d\n\nShe added, however, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with filing a non-frivolous motion to bring attention to an issue and start a conversation. Given the courts\u2019 historic emphasis on settlement, I just don\u2019t see how that conversation goes anywhere.\u201d\n\nThis past week, Purdue Pharma, the company most widely blamed for its role in the crisis, announced a tentative settlement with all the municipalities and about half the state attorneys general who have separately sued members of the drug industry in state courts. If finalized, that agreement would remove Purdue from the first trial.\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost (R), whose state backs the Purdue settlement, also has asked to halt the trial, saying the municipalities should allow states to take the lead in the litigation.\n\nIn the lead-up to the trial, Polster denied a series of motions filed by the companies seeking to throw out, or limit, the case against them. Those included a defense motion to dismiss arguments that the drug companies conspired with each other to protect their companies from enforcement actions by the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nPolster also rejected a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 legal theory that the companies created a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d by inundating communities across the nation with enormous amounts of pain pills. And he denied a defense motion to dismiss a strategy to pursue the case under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, originally created to prosecute the Mafia.\n\nThis past week, Polster agreed to an unusual plan that would include 30,000 jurisdictions across the United States in any settlement, if they agreed to it. It is aimed at preventing more lawsuits and ensuring that communities everywhere get some money from any settlement.\n\nIn their motion, the drug distributors and retail chains said the crucial test is whether a reasonable person would conclude that Polster appeared biased against the defendants.\n\nThey cited Polster\u2019s statements inside and outside court \u201cevidencing a personal objective to do something meaningful to abate the opioid crisis, with the funding to be provided through defendants\u2019 settlements,\u201d as well as \u201cnumerous improper comments to the media and in public forums about the litigation.\u201d\n\nAnd they noted Polster\u2019s \u201capparent prejudgment of the merits and outcome of the litigation and singular focus on, and substantial involvement in, settlement discussions.\u201d\n\nThey also protested his decision to limit defendants to 12.5 hours apiece to present their cases during the upcoming trial.\n\nLast month, an appellate court admonished some of the defendants for a legal attack on Polster over an unrelated question. The panel of appellate judges said their claim that Polster\u2019s \u201cassurances are not entitled to our respect because [he] has been deceptive or duplicitous \u2026 is a very serious allegation and we find no merit to it.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPurdue Pharma reaches tentative deal in federal, state opioid lawsuits\n\nInside the drug industry\u2019s plan to defeat the DEA\n\n76 billion opioid pills: Newly released federal data unmasks the epidemic", "description": "A motion filed Saturday argues Judge Dan Aaron Polster should step aside because he has become too involved, pushing for a settlement from the beginning of the case.", "authors": ["Scott Higham", "Investigative Reporter", "Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health", "September At Am", "Scott Higham Is A Pulitzer-Prize Winning Investigative Reporter At The Washington Post", "Where He Has Worked On Metro", "National", "Foreign Projects Since", "Lenny Bernstein Covers Health"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/d4fcCPmr2AzS17ZYR3-8GrE5sP8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YGOUYLWW7II6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
