From the gurus who seem to think the coffee is the root of all money problems to your neighbour who just loves to hand out pearls of \u201cwisdom,\u201d we\u2019re bombarded with advice. Some of that advice is terrible.\n\nIf anyone offers you the following financial advice, you have our permission to ignore it completely. As for whether to argue with the advice-giver\u2019s flawed logic ... well, we\u2019ll leave that decision up to you.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d stop buying expensive coffee, you wouldn\u2019t be so broke.\u201d\n\nPeople who don\u2019t like to have fun love to remind you that this small purchase you make regularly is ruining your financial future. Sure, $5 here and there can drain your bank account quicker than you might realise. But your regular trips to the coffee shop probably don\u2019t add up to \u201cpeeing one million dollars down the drain,\u201d as Suze Orman would like to scare you into thinking.\n\nIf you took the $5 a day you spend on coffee and invested it for 30 years, you wouldn\u2019t have anywhere near a million dollars. You\u2019d have about $200,000, which may be enough motivation to cut back on extra purchases a bit. But cutting coffee, or soft drinks, or takeout lunches, or happy hour out completely won\u2019t suddenly transform your finances overnight. Go ahead, make your next cup a grande if you don\u2019t feel like making coffee at home.\n\n\u201cJust go to university, you might need a higher degree.\u201d\n\nRemember when we were just starting to crawl our way out of the Great Recession, and there were no jobs, and a bunch of us said, \u201cLet\u2019s just go back to school. This will all be solved by the time we graduate.\u201d That was a great idea, except most of those people still have a bunch of HECS debt. And salaries for people with graduate degrees don\u2019t always match the level you might expect an advanced degree to offer.\n\nIf you begin your higher education knowing that you may need a higher degree to succeed in your career (say, to be a doctor, attorney, or actual rocket scientist), then the value of investing in a graduate degree is clear. If you can\u2019t clearly lay out how a degree will accelerate your career growth (with numbers, please), it\u2019s time to rethink the whole idea.\n\n\u201cOwning a home is the only way you\u2019ll ever build wealth. Renting is a waste.\u201d\n\nHome prices are going up way quicker than wages are increasing, so don\u2019t feel bad if you\u2019re spending so much of your income on a rental that you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be able to save enough for a home of your own. Putting your cash in investments counts as \u201cadulting\u201d just as much as taking out a mortgage does.\n\nAnd for many, homeownership just doesn\u2019t make sense. Before you end up feeling backed into the homeownership-or-bust corner, remember that your individual circumstances along with those of the region where you live can add up to more tally marks in the \u201cpros\u201d column for renting.\n\n\u201cJust make the minimum student debt payment.\u201d\n\nIf you have a HECS or HELP debt, there are some actions you can take to shorten the amount of time it takes to pay over gobs of money for your degree. While it probably won't shave years off your schedule, it may give you peace of mind to know that even if your debt is large, you can start chipping away at a bigger portion of it a little faster.\n\nTell us in the comments about the worst financial advice you ever received, and how you responded.", "description": "Even though many of us were taught as kids that it\u2019s not polite to talk about money, the world is overflowing with people who want to tell you exactly what you should do with yours.
