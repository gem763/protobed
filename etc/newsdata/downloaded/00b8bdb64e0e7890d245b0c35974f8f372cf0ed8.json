And we\u2019ve got a tremendous track record with respect to hostages,\u201d Trump said, adding that he had \u201cbrought a lot of people back home\u201d without having to spend any money.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Brien, who was in the president\u2019s plane on the way to California, said: \u201cWe look forward to another year and a half of peace through strength. We\u2019ve had tremendous foreign policy successes under President Trump\u2019s leadership. I expect those to continue.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien made a rare appearance in the headlines when Trump sent him to Stockholm to monitor the trial of A$AP Rocky, a political stunt that infuriated the Swedish government.\n\nWhen the court released the rapper and two of his associates, before finding them guilty, O\u2019Brien declared it a \u201cvery good night for the United States of America and for the Kingdom of Sweden\u201d.\n\nO\u2019Brien, a Mormon, was a campaign adviser to Mitt Romney, but has been unstintingly loyal to Trump, careful to credit him with any hostage successes.\n\nIn April, Trump quoted O\u2019Brien as saying: \u201cPresident Donald J Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States. 20 hostages, many in impossible circumstances, have been released in last two years. No money was paid.\u201d\n\nThe White House later insisted the quote had come from O\u2019Brien, who had said Trump had \u201cunparalleled success\u201d in bringing home hostages.\n\n\u201cTrump, after enduring the Bolton experience, clearly has no use for a strong personality or ideologue in the National Security Adviser position. Pompeo may not be dual-hatted as secretary of state and NSA, but he might as well be with this arrangement,\u201d a former national security council spokesman, Ned Price, said on Twitter.\n\nBefore the Trump administration, O\u2019Brien had a largely low-key government career. George W Bush sent him as a representative to the UN general assembly in 2005 and he was involved judicial reform in Afghanistan in the last year of the Bush administration.\n\nIn 2016, he published a collection of hawkish essays on foreign policy, titled While America Slept: Restoring American Leadership to a World in Crisis, which was heavily critical of the Obama administration.\n\nIt denounced the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran as appeasement, and O\u2019Brien derided the Obama approach as \u201cleading from behind\u201d. He claimed that \u201cpeak political correctness in the west\u201d had held governments back in the fight against Isis.\n\n\u201cBeing the leader of the free world does not mean being the policeman of the entire world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt does mean that America should use its moral authority to promote the idea of free men and women and free markets for the betterment of the world.\u201d\n\nThe book\u2019s rhetoric positions O\u2019Brien as a traditional Republican hawk \u2013 a straightforward match with Pompeo, but not necessarily an easy fit with Trump.\n\nThe initial reaction among Washington diplomats is that O\u2019Brien is likely to restore the interagency decision-making process that Bolton sought to destroy by cutting down \u201cprincipals meetings\u201d of department heads. In the new set-up, however, Pompeo is likely to have a dominant role.\n\nIn contrast to the acerbic Bolton, O\u2019Brien seems to be able to get along with people of different political stripes.\n\nAndrew Exum, a former senior official in the Obama defence department, tweeted that O\u2019Brien \u201cis a really, really good person and that I wish him all the best in what will certainly be a challenging role.\u201d", "description": "Elevation of the state department\u2019s chief hostage negotiator seen as a win for US secretary of state Mike Pompeo", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a40c3fff7f91a3329cf68fe5109fb9b699a39a56/0_76_4876_2925/master/4876.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7992cca3f54ded3a70a3c4e815d6cb1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
