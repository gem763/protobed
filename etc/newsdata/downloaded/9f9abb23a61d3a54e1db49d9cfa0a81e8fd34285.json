The visitation is a non-judicial, non-administrative process.\n\n\"Bishop Malone has committed to cooperate fully and stated that this Visitation is for the good of the Church in Buffalo,\" the statement reads. \"The purpose of an apostolic visitation is to assist the diocese and improve the local Church's ability to minister to the people it serves.\"\n\nFrank Franklin II/AP\n\nThe Diocese of Buffalo has been in a state of crisis since last year, when Siobhan O'Connor, Malone's former personal secretary, leaked internal church documents to investigative reporter Charlie Specht from ABC's local station WKBW, sparking months of stories about whether there had been efforts to conceal the extent of the problem from the public.\n\nThat crisis deepened in September with the emergence of secret audio recordings obtained by ABC News and by WKBW.\n\nThe recordings suggest Malone sought to conceal allegations that an active priest had sexually harassed a then-seminarian, even though Malone can be heard on the tapes describing the accused priest as \"a sick puppy\" and calling his alleged penchant for manipulation and retaliation \"dangerous.\"\n\nGregory A. Shemitz/Reuters\n\nBishop Malone has since faced widespread calls for his resignation, from both local Catholic and local civic leaders, and he's cited the Vatican's apparent lack of concern in his defense.\n\n\"They say the pope frequently picks up the phone and calls people around the world, but I have not been the recipient of one of these calls,\" Malone said in September. \"I've had no communications from the pope at all.\"\n\n\"I know for sure they're not unaware of all the news around here,\" he continued. \"But so far apparently I like to think they are trusting in my goodwill and my intention and my capacity working with other people to lead us further. But if I get a call from the pope, maybe I'll let you know.\"\n\nIn its statement on Thursday, the Diocese of Buffalo acknowledged that an Apostolic Visitation is conducted \"on behalf of the pope.\"\n\n\"Heartfelt gratitude,\" the statement reads, \"is expressed to all those who are working so generously on this Visitation.\"", "description": "The Vatican is taking action after questions have been raised about the handling of sexual abuse claims in the diocese of Buffalo.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/richard-malone-ap-jt-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
