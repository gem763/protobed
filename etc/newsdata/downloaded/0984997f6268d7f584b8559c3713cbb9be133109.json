Look at it fly!\u201d another says.\n\nThe video was taken by a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet in 2015 off the US\u2019 east coast, according to To the Stars Academy.\n\nView photos Tom DeLonge | Joby Sessions/Total Guitar Magazine via Getty More\n\nRELATED: Astronaut Receives Honorary Degree \u2014 in Space! \u2014 and Delivers Inspiring Speech: \u2018Fly Among the Stars\n\nThe videos referenced Tuesday made headlines back in 2017 and 2018 after being brought to light by the former Blink-182 rocker\u2019s To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science research group and later republished by the Times. According to the group, the videos reveal \u201cdeclassified Pentagon footage of unidentified flying objects,\u201d Gizmodo reported.\n\nUFO-Aktuellt writer Roger Glassel told Vice that the fact that the Navy used the term \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena is significant because it \u201cshows that they have broadened what is expected to be reported by U.S. fighter pilots to investigate anything unknown in their airspace that in the past has been connected with a stigma.\u201d", "description": "Navy Confirms UFO Video Contains 'Unidentified Aerial Phenomena'", "authors": ["Ashley Boucher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Lil.aBRIdSGcEowWjH_M7g--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/7a4e00f489ab8700c1e8837005b3d65b", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
