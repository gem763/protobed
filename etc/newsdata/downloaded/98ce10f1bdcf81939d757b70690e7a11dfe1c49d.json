In fact, one portfolio manager in particular has singled out a stock he thinks makes the perfect short: Netflix.\n\n\"You can look at Netflix on a valuation basis, and on any ratio or multiple it's extremely expensive,\" Tobias Carlisle, the founder and portfolio manager of The Acquirers Fund, said on \"We Study Billionaires,\" an investing podcast. \"The only way that this sort of makes sense as an investment on the long side is if it keeps growing at this very high rate.\"\n\nCarlisle is best known as the author of \"The Acquirer's Multiple, Concentrated Investing, Deep Value, and Quantitative Value.\" Before forming The Acquirers Fund, he was an analyst at an activist hedge fund.\n\nAs of today, Netflix has a price-to-earnings ratio of 115, a price-to-book ratio of 21, and an enterprise multiple of about 70. These metrics look tech-bubble-esque \u2014 and when valuations are priced to perfection, the slightest mishap in earnings can pull the rug out from under investors.\n\nIn fact, that's exactly what happened when Netflix reported second-quarter earnings. During the period, the streaming giant reported a loss of more than 100,000 subscribers, against expectations of a 300,000 gain. And Wall Street was relentless in its punishment. The stock plummeted more than 10%.\n\nBut lofty valuations aren't the only thing that Carlisle is worried about; he's also keeping a close eye on growing costs and emerging competitors.\n\nRead more: Global central banks are making investors pay to stash their money. An investment chief overseeing $4.5 billion explains why that would be a disaster for the US.\n\n\"The kind of business that Netflix is in is more like a movie studio now \u2014 in the sense they have to produce this really great content,\" he said. \"Content is becoming very, very expensive by historical standards.\"\n\nIn short, in order to stay relevant, Netflix constantly has to pay up for engaging, bingeworthy content \u2014 and that content is not cheap. It requires a ton of cash, and the show/movie that they're paying for isn't guaranteed to be a hit. If their purchase falls flat on its face, they're left holding the bag. It happens to movie studios all the time.\n\nIn addition to lofty valuations and increasing content costs, Carlisle references a plethora of emerging competitors set to eat into Netflix's lunch.\n\n\"Disney has got very good at figuring out what people like,\" he said. \"So now Netflix is just going to be going straight head-to-head with a great content producer that's going to have its own distribution in the same way through Hulu, and through its own app.\"\n\nDisney owns Marvel, ESPN, Lucasfilm, and Pixar, and it boasts the world's greatest library of children's entertainment. That's a lot of great content. And in today's environment, consumers flock to the platform that offers the most bang for their buck.\n\nThis spells trouble for Netflix, and that's not even taking in to account free platforms like YouTube, where the content costs are zero, and viewership is growing.\n\n\"What I do think happens is that it becomes incredibly hard for it to sustain that enormous valuation,\" Carlisle added. \"As that happens, the valuation comes down. It could be trading half where it is.\"", "description": "Tobias Carlisle builds his Netflix bear thesis around lofty valuations, increasing content costs, and a plethora of emerging competitors.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d2644dfa17d6c0aa325acd4-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
