Blythe, in support of a criminal complaint\n\nAllen also is facing a charge of 'interference with access to reproductive health care services,' Vice reported.\n\nUnder the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, the latter charge refers to a form of abuse known as reproductive coercion, which covers heavily monitoring a woman's menstrual cycle, destroying or tampering with her birth control, and pressuring them to get pregnant.\n\nAuthorities arrested Allen on September 25. It was not immediately known whether he was detained, or if he remains so.\n\nAllen, who is from South Carolina, was reportedly in a relationship with the woman, who claimed she became pregnant after the sexual assault earlier this year.\n\nShe also accused Allen of physically abusing her and threatening to kill her relatives.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Allen was identified through subpoenaed phone records that indicated the number used to reach out to the clinic.\n\n'I never made a bomb threat,' Allen was alleged to have said when he was confronted by investigators about the call to the clinic.\n\nAfter a further examination of his phone records, the investigators learned that between August 18 and 30, Allen's phone had been used to make 18 calls to abortion clinics, including 16 within Jacksonville's 904 area code.\n\nThe fake bomb threat had been made on August 29.\n\nAn affidavit in support of a criminal complaint says Rodney Allen was arrested for making a fake bomb threat to a Jacksonville, Florida, abortion clinic where his ex-, whom he sexually assaulted, was seeking to abort their unborn child which was a result of the attack (file image)\n\nHe was alleged to also have made 24 calls, using the *67 feature that blocks the number from which a person is calling.\n\nDuring the same time period, he is also alleged to have sent 69 text messages and called his ex- 123 times.\n\nShe is referred to in the affidavit only by the initials A.S.\n\nThe phone records also show calls were made to a hotel and motel, where his ex- said she was planning on staying while she had the abortion, until she discovered someone had cancelled her reservations.\n\nShe complained to authorities that she had made several attempts to get an abortion previously, not just in Florida, but as well as in North Carolina and Georgia, only to discover that someone she believed was Allen had cancelled them.\n\nThe FBI investigators suspected he had access to the woman's cell phone and text messaging records to track what clinics she had called. He also is believed to have had a patient code that allowed him to alter and cancel reservations on behalf of his ex.\n\nIt was when investigators reached out to the ex, that their suspicions of Allen's access to the phone records was confirmed.\n\nA special agent who had called the woman on September 11 received multiple missed calls afterwards from a blocked number, the affidavit says.\n\nThe agent, who was able to answer one of the calls, asked if it was Allen, and he confirmed it was him.\n\nThe agent asked how Allen had gotten his number, and alleged that Allen said it was relating to an unknown Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, or ATF, investigation.\n\nUpon meeting with him later on September 16, the agents claimed the man asked whether 'justification of emotion' would keep him from being arrested.'\n\n'We all make mistakes and some have greater consequences than others,' said a deputy US marshal aiding in the investigation told him, according to the affidavit.\n\n'I guess this would definitely qualify,' the agents recalled Allen responding, although he still denied making a bomb threat.\n\nAn FBI spokeswoman could not immediately provide more details about Allen, including his age, when DailyMail.com reached out.", "description": "Rodney Allen, of South Carolina, allegedly made a fake bomb treat to an abortion clinic in Jacksonvile, Florida, when his ex made an appointment there to end her pregnancy.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
