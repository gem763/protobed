(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nDo you want your horror movies to be five hours long? Well, have I got a treat for you.\n\nWith It: Chapter Two hitting theatres, rumours have been abounding for a little while about a possible supercut of both It movies, which would, presumably, mirror the structure of the books they\u2019re based on, which jump around between adult and child versions of the Loser\u2019s Club a lot more frequently than the films do.\n\nIt\u2019s a very fandom sort of rumour, an imagined clown car\u2019s worth of cut together footage that would rival Stephen King\u2019s novel in terms of length and indulgence.\n\nAnd director Andy Muschietti? Seems, uh, pretty serious about making it. As he told ET at the movie\u2019s premiere, he\u2019s not done with Derry quite yet.\n\n\u201cThe studio probably doesn\u2019t know this\u2026\u201d he joked, before explaining: \u201cNo, we\u2019re in talks with the studio to make a supercut, which is basically the two movies edited together with all the material that is not in the released versions. And yeah, there are a couple of scenes that I want to shoot to make this a new experience.\u201d\n\nThat, my beloved losers, is a lot of Pennywise. A sprawling, mashed-together version of these movies might make for a fun movie night, but would it make for a good, entertaining movie? I\u2019m worried it wouldn\u2019t \u2014 especially when the second film already has a bad tendency to drag. But, hey, I say go for it. I\u2019m sure a lot of people would be down to clown.", "description": "Do you want your horror movies to be five hours long?
