I had a bad cold and wasn\u2019t at the races a lot of a time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe dress rehearsal was so bad no one would look me in the eye. Katya said, \u2018Don\u2019t think about it, don\u2019t watch it\u2019. I kept missing the 10th step and the next 30 seconds of the routine went to pot.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cOn the live show, I came up to the 10th step like a horse approaching a fence, in slow motion. I was thinking, \u2018Here we go, here we go\u2019. Then the foot landed and from that moment I knew the rest of the dance would follow.\n\n\u201cSo at the end, Katya realised for the first time ever we\u2019d pulled the dance off. It was like being 3-0 down at home to a non-league football team then coming back in the last minute. The relief and release of emotions was intense.\u201d\n\nViewers will feel just as relieved to hear they are not watching Katya, who faced accusations she was drunk after falling in two shows, unravel because of personal reasons. But does Mike feel her traumatic year has left her feeling scrutinised and fragile?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cCrikey, no. I\u2019ve not noticed anything. Neil is so supportive, so I haven\u2019t felt that. Katya\u2019s got so much energy, he\u2019s absolutely on fire.\u201d\n\nMike, 53, married Emily, 39, in May and has three daughters from his previous marriage \u2013 Lucy, 22, Izzy, 20, and Sophie, 16 \u2013 as well as a 10-year-old stepson, Josh.\n\nBefore slipping on his Strictly kit he was best known for his have-a-go attitude of trying over 500 different sports and falling in to a swimming pool during a live interview at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games \u2013 a clip shared 11.5 million times in a day. He is notoriously clumsy, so he is still stunned head judge Shirley Ballas hailed last week\u2019s quickstep as \u201csophisticated\u201d. And he says the miraculous transformation from dud-dancer to 32-point slick-mover is down to Katya \u2013 and something from his wife\u2019s bottom drawer.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cI changed into my lucky socks after the disastrous dress rehearsal,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re black, really thin and extra-long. I think they might be Emily\u2019s. But they\u2019re definitely\n\nnot stockings.\u201d\n\nThe story of Mike\u2019s romance with Emily is full of fun and shows his bubbly on-screen persona is genuine. Last October, after a seven-month romance, he proposed dressed as Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings. The gag was a bit lost on her, as she had never seen the film, but she still said yes. Their first dance at the wedding was \u201cjumping up and down to Sun Is Shining by Axwell & Ingrosso, which is a bit of a trance tune, so quite unconventional\u201d.\n\nEmily, who said her first impression of 5ft 5in Mike was \u201cGosh, you\u2019re quite short\u201d, has Katya to thank for her hubby\u2019s new slimline body.\n\nAt the start of the series, she pointed out, with a pat on his tum, that she would work on his belly. Did the jibe hurt?\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cOh no, I\u2019m an average bloke on the sofa,\u201d says Mike. \u201cI go running and play football sometimes but it\u2019s not enough to work off the odd pint and takeaway. The intensity of the training works every muscle, you naturally become leaner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost over a stone. I can wear shirts I couldn\u2019t get on two months ago.\u201d\n\nDoes Emily like his new look? \u201cOh indeed! Emily\u2019s really finding a new me, physically.\u201d\n\nEmily\u2019s not the only one, as Mike is winning legions of new fans who love his cuddly cheeriness.\n\n\u201cLots of mums have been sending nice messages. It\u2019s lovely to have people think I\u2019m cuddly but I\u2019m not when I\u2019m all sweaty and tired. But I\u2019ve not been asked to do a calendar yet \u2013 I\u2019d scare people.\u201d\n\nBut the calendar offer is bound to come this weekend, after his samba to the Sugarhill Gang\u2019s Jump On It. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of hip action, hip thrusting and a samba roll,\u201d he says.\n\nGoing by previous form, which has seen Mike as a rhinestone cowboy and whipping off a fireman\u2019s uniform after sliding down a pole, his next routine is sure to entertain.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I think I\u2019d be a cowboy with Katya flipping up on to my shoulders, or sliding down the biggest pole in Strictly history. They are iconic moments that will stay with me for life.\u201d\n\nBut after Radio 1 DJ Dev Griffin\u2019s shock exit, Mike knows no one is safe. \u201cWe were stunned to see Dev go. Up in the auditorium, Chris Ramsey nudged me and said, \u2018This is embarrassing, they\u2019ve got us two dad dancers up here and we\u2019re through, yet Dev\u2019s out\u2019. It was such a shock we all gasped.\n\n\u201cAs the oldest contestant, it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m not the best dancer. All I can do is work extra-hard in rehearsals, do exactly what Katya says and wear my lucky socks.\u201d\n\n* Strictly is on BBC1 Saturday at 7.10pm.", "description": "Mike admits Katya's tears are all his fault as he insists they have nothing to do with her split from husband Neil", "authors": ["Julie Mccaffrey", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20648139.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THPP_CHP_270719Slug_520JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
