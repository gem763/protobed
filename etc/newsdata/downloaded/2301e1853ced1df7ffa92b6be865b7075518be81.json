That\u2019s because the newlywed, as she explained to Entertainment Tonight in a new interview, was hopeful the show would finally embrace the first black Bachelor with fan-favorite Mike Johnson, in the same way she made history as The Bachelorette\u2019s first black lead two years ago. \u201cI think Peter seems like a very nice guy. He seems lovely. This is absolutely nothing against him, but how many Peters have we seen before?\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cWhat season are we on? 24. So, we\u2019ve seen 24 Peters. I\u2019m bored. And it\u2019s nothing personal against him.\u201d She added that since no alums within the Bachelorverse had yet to voice their opinions on the casting, she felt it was her \u201cduty\u201d to be vocal about hers.\n\n\u201cI want to be hopeful, but when you have a contestant like Mike Johnson, who seems to check all the boxes, how is he not the Bachelor? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m sure they have some reason for not picking him, and I\u2019m going to trust in that, but at the same time, the system isn\u2019t working in giving us a Bachelor who is a person of color. So we need to change the system. Something has to be done. Break the rules, step outside the box, give the people what they want.\u201d Lindsay, who recently wed the winner of her Bachelorette season, had previously been critical about how she thought the franchise treated her poorly. In particular, she condemned the way the producers handled her season finale, saying they made her look like an \u201cangry black female\u201d with the episode\u2019s editing style.", "description": "Former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay spoke out about the new Bachelor, Peter Weber, and how she\u2019s \u201cbored\u201d by another white man in the role.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/18/18-rachel-lindsay.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
