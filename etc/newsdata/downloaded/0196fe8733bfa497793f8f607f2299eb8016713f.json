It is a reality,\" Luca Ugena said. \"It is operating in a very reliable manner. It is extremely mature as an aircraft.\"\n\nBoeing said in August it had pushed back the entry into service of the 777-8 beyond its earlier plan for 2022. The larger 777-9, due to enter service first with a shorter range, has faced engine-related delays and is not expected to make its first test flight until next year.\n\n\"Our timetable on the 777-8 obviously is still under consideration for when it actually enters service,\" Darren Hulst, a senior marketing executive at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Sydney on Wednesday.\n\n\"But it is really more of when (we have) the combination of the demand from our customers and how it aligns with the design and production for the 777X as a programme.\"\n\nHe declined to comment on whether an order from Qantas would accelerate Boeing's plans for the 777-8. To date, Emirates and Qatar Airways are Boeing's only customers for the plane, having ordered 35 and 10 respectively.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark has said some 777X orders could be switched to 787s. Emirates and Qatar Airways did not respond to previous requests for comment on their 777-8 orders.\n\nBoeing has put forward a \"compelling offer\" to deal with any delays to the 777-8 in its contest against Airbus for planes for Sydney-London flights, Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in August, without providing further details.\n\nThe Australian and International Pilots Association, which represents Qantas pilots, said on Wednesday it would help gather data on fatigue on three planned research flights, starting with the New York-Sydney journey on Friday. A London-Sydney flight is planned next month.\n\nThe union cautioned the flights would not replicate real-world conditions.", "description": "Production date for Boeing's long-haul 777-8 up in air as Qantas weighs options", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F1ZL_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
