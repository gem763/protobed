Canada last week requested makers of the drug to halt distribution as it gathers more information.\n\nBranded versions of the drug such as Sanofi SA\u2019s Zantac are available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale in Canada, while generic versions are available for sale both OTC and with prescription.", "description": "Health Canada said on Wednesday four more companies were recalling heartburn drug ranitidine, commonly known by its brand name Zantac, after presence of a probable cancer-causing impurity was found in some of the drugs.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
