This weekend alone there were several incidents that left fans confused. At Tottenham, Gerard Deulofeu appeared to be blatantly fouled in the box by Jan Vertonghen, but a VAR check did not result in a penalty. There looked to have been a foul in the build-up to Spurs\u2019 goal, too, but again consulting VAR changed nothing (although \u2018Decision: No Goal\u2019 did briefly flash up on the big screen, leading to more bemusement). There was controversy at Leicester and at Wolves, too.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThese inconsistencies and avoidable errors only serve to heighten the resentment felt towards this new technology. \u201cI thought VAR was supposed to be helping football,\u201d said a frustrated Quique Sanchez Flores after the game. At the moment, the general consensus is that it probably isn\u2019t.\n\n2) City still dominant despite makeshift defence\n\nManchester City did not field a centre-back at Crystal Palace on Saturday. With Nicolas Otamendi injured and John Stones only fit enough for a place on the bench, Pep Guardiola turned to midfielders Fernandinho and Rodri as his defensive partnership.\n\nIt was hardly ideal, but it is testament to the quality of this City team that they still left Selhurst Park with a relatively comfortable victory. In attack, the Premier League champions were as incisive as ever. Ederson was forced into a couple of impressive saves at the other end but there were none of the defensive deficiencies that might have been expected.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Liverpool The other day one of their world-class forwards was quite unhappy with one of their other world-class forwards for not being generous enough with their inexhaustible buffet of clear-cut chances. That's it. That's all we've got. The Independent's highly scientific crisis score: 0.2%. Getty 2/20 19. Sheffield United It's not just that United are happily mid-table, with a fan for a manager and a style of play that's genuinely unique. It's that they've come up and looked every bit the Premier League team, resilient in the games they've won and competitive in the games they've lost. And, of course, they play with overlapping centre-backs, a surefire sign that you're either so deep in crisis you've lost your mind, or in such a good place you can afford to give Chris Basham a free role. Crisis score: 1%. PA 3/20 18. Leicester City Only Manchester City and Liverpool have won more points than Leicester since Brendan Rodgers took charge in February. They look a serious threat to the top six, and seem to have absorbed the sale of Harry Maguire impressively with Lord Farquaad every bit his replacement. Crisis score: 3%. EPA 4/20 17. Manchester City City are plunged deep in crisis, obviously, in the TalkSport definition of the word, having slipped up three times already this season, while they have an injury crisis, especially at centre-half. But in actual, real world terms, they are still the slickest operation in football with the best manager around, as well as back-to-back Premier League titles and a points record all in recent memory. Crisis score: 4%. EPA 5/20 16. Crystal Palace Palace were in crisis before the season had even begun, widely tipped to sack Roy Hodgson before the clocks go back and to be relegated before they go forwards again. Aaron Wan-Bissaka had left, Wilfred Zaha wanted to leave, and just it felt like the end of this particular chapter. Instead they bounce into the international break sixth and already with a third of the points they will need to stay up. Everything's relative. Crisis score: 8%. Reuters 6/20 15.

Bournemouth Bournemouth have established themselves in the Premier League's centre ground so impressively that they are probably the only side with absolutely no chance of finishing in the top six or the bottom three. This in itself could soon mould into a crisis of identity if they're not careful, the sort that sent Stoke and West Brom into oblivion, but Eddie Howe has so far not let standards slip. Crisis score: 15%. Getty Images 9/20 12. Aston Villa Having put a three-year stay in the Championship behind them, and financial difficulties apparently in the past too, these are good times at Villa. Now they're up \u2013 with a local captain, a well-respected manager and big Brazilian goalscorer finding the net \u2013 they have a real chance of staying there. Crisis score: 17%. Reuters 10/20 11. Brighton and Hove Albion Graham Potter is going well at Brighton, and perhaps the only fear at the Amex is that he goes too well, alerting the likes of Everton and even Tottenham come the end of the year. Crisis score: 19%. REUTERS 11/20 10. Chelsea It turns out contravening Fifa's rules on the transfer of foreign minors was not in fact a grievous misdemeanour but a blessing in disguise, forcing Frank Lampard to trust the kids, with heartwarming results. Even so, it should be noted that Chelsea cannot sign anyone until next summer and their owner has pulled the plug on a new stadium. Still, Eden who? Crisis score: 22%. Reuters 12/20 9. Arsenal The current Arsenal phenomenon is best explained by Jonathan Liew in his recent column on the subject, but it can accurately be described as a will to scrap out results from the most dire circumstances that is so un-Arsenal-like they are almost unrecognisable. Even their walking crisis, David Luiz, scored on the weekend. Crisis score: 22%. Getty 13/20 8. Norwich Despite coming up by winning the Championship, and despite the excellent start to the season made by Teemu Pukki and co, the thrashing by Aston Villa reminded us that this is a team that haven't really had to defend for about two years and don't really know how. Daniel Farke had the face of a man with all the knowledge and none of the tools to solve that particular problem. Crisis score: 23%. Getty Images 14/20 7. West Ham A club perpetually on the verge of crisis who are quietly having a very good season so far with the makings of a genuinely potent front three in that Yarmolenko-Haller-Anderson triumvirate. It could all fall down at any moment of course, but things looks suspiciously stable. Crisis score: 29%. Getty 15/20 6. Southampton Saints have made a slow start to the season and there is a feeling that Ralph Hasenhuttl's galvanising effect might have worn off. The knack of unearthing foreign gems to complement the talent falling off their production line has escaped Southampton in recent transfer windows, and it feels like a tough season looms. Crisis score: 37% Getty Images 16/20 5. Tottenham Mauricio Pochettino's time at the club seems to be reaching its natural end point, which is concerning enough, but the fact that it also seems to be the end for a raft of key players means Spurs are in need of a major overhaul. Playing NFL in a shiny new stadium cannot hide this. Crisis score: 53%. Getty 17/20 4. Everton Marco Silva's side seem wedged in a rut. Four defeats in a row leaves Everton in the relegation zone during the international break and perhaps most concerning is that clubs like Sheffield United, Bournemouth and Burnley all found them so easy to beat. There has been plenty of money spent over the past couple of seasons so it is hard to see how the problem gets solved without a wholesale change of direction. Crisis score: 56%. Getty 18/20 3. Watford We hesitate to condemn Watford, who have a happy knack of resurrection and will simply churn through managers until one's arrival bounces them back up the league, but things have felt stale for a while now, going back to April when their slump began. Javi Gracia has gone, Quique Sanchez Flores is struggling to make much of an impact, and a goal difference of -16 from eight games is alarming. Crisis score: 65%. AFP/Getty 19/20 2. Newcastle For all the optimism of the Longstaff brothers and the scalp of the club formerly known as Manchester United, Newcastle fans are unlikely to be fooled into thinking the glory days are just around the corner. A relegation scrap is imminent, and it will be an even harder slog than usual without Rafa Benitez. Meanwhile, Mike Ashley continues to lurk in the background like Dominic Cummings in a suit. Crisis score: 73%. Getty 20/20 1. Manchester United The last time Manchester United made a genuinely successful transfer was David de Gea in 2011. The last time Manchester United appointed a genuinely successful manager was Sir Alex Ferguson in 1986. Current odds are shorter on relegation than the title. It is a club wandering directionless towards another decade of mediocrity, the kind Liverpool endured for so long, and it will take an overhaul across the board to fix.

Getty\n\nA trip to in-form Palace was a tough test for City \u2013 especially given their shortage of defenders \u2013 but they came through unscathed and still within sight of leaders Liverpool.\n\n3) Spurs still struggling to find their feet\n\nA home game against Watford would have been seen as an ideal opportunity to get back on track for Mauricio Pochettino and his players.\n\nBut wins are hard to come by at the moment for Spurs. That 7-2 humbling against Bayern appears to have done some lasting psychological damage: Tottenham look nervous and uncertain, completely lacking in any confidence.\n\nAnd they might have lost against Watford \u2013 who had just three points and had conceded 20 goals prior to this game \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t for Dele Alli\u2019s late intervention. Things need to turnaround soon for Spurs.\n\n4) Chelsea hitting form under Lampard\n\nQuietly, Chelsea have turned a mixed start to the season into a reasonably good one. Frank Lampard\u2019s side have now won five games in a row in all competitions, and climbed into the top four with a 1-0 victory over Newcastle this weekend.\n\nThere are signs that Chelsea\u2019s early season defensive problems are beginning to be addressed too. The Blues are certainly not completely watertight at the back yet, but they have conceded just twice in their last four games, including welcome clean sheets against Brighton and Newcastle.\n\nThere is still plenty of work for Lampard and his young side to do, though, if they are to finish in the top four this season.\n\n5) Marco Silva gets a reprieve\n\nHad the result at Goodison Park been different on Saturday afternoon, it might have been the end for Marco Silva.\n\nEverton\u2019s poor start to the season has left many fans calling for the Portuguese\u2019s head, and there was a feeling prior to the West Ham game that this was his last chance.\n\nThe Toffees needed a performance and they got it, albeit against a fairly lacklustre West Ham side. But there was an energy and purposefulness about Everton, who certainly have the players capable of pushing into the top half of the table.\n\n6) Grealish influential as Villa make solid start\n\nAston Villa were forced to deal with some heavy pressure in the first half of Saturday\u2019s win over Brighton, falling behind to an Adam Webster goal.\n\nBut they grew into the game and eventually turned it on its head. Jack Grealish, as is so often the case, was the main man for the hosts, scoring the equaliser and then cleverly setting up Matt Targett for his injury-time winner.\n\nGrealish, for all of Villa\u2019s signings in the summer, remains the club\u2019s most influential player. And his form will be crucial as Dean Smith\u2019s side look to keep themselves above the bottom three.\n\n7) A welcome away point (and clean sheet) for Norwich\n\nNorwich had lost all four of their away games this season prior to Saturday\u2019s visit to Bournemouth. They had conceded 10 goals too, brushed aside far too easily by their more savvy opposition.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They earned a hard-fought point at the Vitality Stadium, and did so with several key players still sidelined through injury.\n\nThey remain in 19th, still without a win since last month\u2019s remarkable 3-2 victory over Manchester City. But there are signs, perhaps, that they are beginning to adapt to the top flight.\n\n8) Leicester win again on anniversary of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's death\n\nLeicester marked the anniversary of former owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's death with a narrow victory over Burnley at the King Power, and it was a fitting result on an emotional day for everyone associated with the club.\n\nThousands of fans took part in a 'Walk for Vichai' prior to the game and there were tributes to Srivaddhanaprabha in the stadium in the lead up to kick-off.\n\nYouri Tielemans\u2019 74th minute strike earned victory for the Foxes, who are now third in the Premier League and, at this point, look realistic contenders for a place in the top four.\n\n9) Ings hitting form at crucial time for Southampton\n\nSouthampton have not always been prolific under Ralph Hasenhuttl, but they appear now to have a striker capable of firing them away from the bottom three.\n\nDanny Ings was on target again at Wolves on Saturday, capitalising on a defensive error to coolly slot home and score his fifth goal in his last four appearances in all competitions.\n\nA striker in such clinical form could be the difference between relegation and safety for the Saints, who have struggled so far this season.\n\n10) United show signs of improvement against lacklustre Liverpool\n\nMost expected a comfortable Liverpool win on Sunday afternoon. But that was not how it turned out. United, despite their dismal start to the season, executed their gameplan well and very nearly secured a valuable three points.\n\nThey couldn't quite hold on in the end - testament to the resilience of Jurgen Klopp's side - but there are positives to take from this for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his players.\n\nMarcus Rashford and Dan James were a constant threat, and United competed well with a team on a run of 17 consecutive Premier League wins. It's a small step forward, but a step forward nonetheless.", "description": "1) VAR controversy continues Though correct decisions have certainly been reached more consistently since its introduction, VAR remains divisive and controversial in the Premier League.", "authors": ["Callum Rice-Coates"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/07/talking-points-today.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
