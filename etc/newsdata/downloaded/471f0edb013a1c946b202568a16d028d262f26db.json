The halt on the ammunition and handgun sales will come into effect when current inventory is sold out.\n\nPRAISE AND CRITICISM\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, applauded the actions, saying, \u201cWalmart has its finger on the pulse of what Americans want.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group with deep political ties, said Walmart was succumbing to pressure from \u201canti-gun elites.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Kroger asks customers to quit openly carrying guns in stores\n\n\u201cLines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms,\u201d it said.\n\nThe company said its latest actions would reduce its share of the ammunition market from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.\n\nU.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.\n\nThe move reflects growing corporate activism on guns.\n\nWalmart, like rival Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS.N), had already ended sales of assault rifles and raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21.\n\nBank of America last year said it would no longer lend to companies making military-style firearms for civilians, and airlines Delta and United last year said they were no longer offering discounted rates to the NRA.\n\nThe latest move will leave Walmart focused on weapons for hunting, including deer rifles, shotguns and related ammunition.\n\n\u201cThe general principle is if we don\u2019t sell the firearm we wouldn\u2019t sell the ammunition,\u201d a spokesman for Walmart told Reuters.\n\nWalmart will stop selling all handgun ammunition and some short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber after clearing current stock. Walmart did not comment on sales of other caliber ammunition.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Walmart store is pictured in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil January 22, 2018.
