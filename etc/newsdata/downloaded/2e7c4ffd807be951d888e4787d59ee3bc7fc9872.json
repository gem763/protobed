Performing near the start of the sexual revolution, The Beatles merely wondered, \u201cAll the lonely people, where do they all belong?\u201d\n\nIronically, the group anticipated an unexpected side-effect of sexual liberation and diminishing monogamy: the elderly dying alone.\n\n\u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d was strangely prescient of an epidemic of loneliness that afflicts our society today. Senior citizens are increasingly isolated , more than one-fifth of millennials say they have no friends , and scientists are even developing a pill for lonely people .\n\nIt\u2019s significant that The Beatles released Eleanor Rigby in the \u201960s. Author Mary Eberstadt might call it a case of foreshadowing, for she argues in Primal Screams: How the Sexual Revolution Created Identity Politics that the sexual revolution led to a national sense of loneliness and lack of identity .\n\nHer book, released this month, makes the case that the sexual revolution led, surprisingly, to the rise of identity politics.\n\n\u201cWherever any one of us stands in matters of the \u2018culture wars\u2019 is immaterial here,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe plain fact is that the relative stability of yesterday\u2019s familial identity could not help but answer the question at the heart of identity politics \u2014 Who am I? \u2014 in ways that many men, women, and children can\u2019t answer it any more.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Primal Screams is a follow-up to Eberstadt's 2012 book, Adam and Eve After the Pill: Paradoxes of the Sexual Revolution. If the sexual revolution led to unexpected problems between men and women, how else has it affected us as a society? Primal Screams answers that question.\n\nEberstadt is a shrewd, thoughtful analyst of our culture, and scrutinizes her subject through a nonpartisan lens. She writes, \u201cthis book would not exist without the conviction that beneath the noise of identity politics lie authentic hardships, including antediluvian ones that have not been hitherto acknowledged.\u201d\n\nPrimal Scream is, then, important for readers of all political and ideological complexions. But it\u2019s especially significant for readers on the Right, who might be tempted to dismiss identity politics as mere snowflakery.\n\nIdentity politics is driven by race, class, corrosive multiculturalism, mentally fragile millennials, and tribalism, among other things. But the sexual revolution made the allure of identity politics much stronger, Ebsterstadt argues. The quest for identity is primal, not political, and the sexual revolution was partly responsible for the break-up of the family structure, which used to provide a sense of identity.\n\nChildren in divorced and non-divorced households, Eberstadt writes, \u201cexhibit starkly opposed concepts of identity.\u201d According to one study, children from divorced parents were almost three times as likely to agree strongly with the statement, \u201cI felt like a different person with each of my parents.\u201d\n\nOther factors such as anonymous sperm donation and surrogate pregnancy have left children searching for truths about their parents. Smaller families mean fewer siblings teaching children by example how to behave.\n\nEbsterstadt gives specifics about how the search for identity manifests itself, and she reinforces the link she discerns between the decline of the family and our yearning for a social structure.\n\nShe argues, for example, that feminism has evolved from a civil rights movement to a survival strategy. \u201cThis is the deeper unrecognized allure of draconian speech codes on campuses and elsewhere: they promise to limit what men can do and say, in a world in which the old limits on male behavior no longer apply.\u201d\n\nAs \u201cthe ethos of recreational sex blurred the line between protector and predator,\u201d women sought an ideology that would protect them from male predation. \u201cHowever unconsciously,\u201d Ebsterstadt writes, \u201cfeminism is in fact expressing an overlooked truth here: today\u2019s women have reason to feel concerned.\u201d\n\nThis brings Ebsterstadt to a claim that androgyny in fashion, the blurring of gender roles, et cetera, gives women a safe space from male predation, and protects men from charges of toxic masculinity. The sexual revolution \u201chas inadvertently subsidized androgyny by raising the penalties for traditional masculinity and femininity,\u201d she writes.\n\nFinally, in the #MeToo movement, women have bonded as victims of sexual assault. But how did we create a culture in which sexual assault is so prevalent? \"It seems safe to bet that many modern men,\u201d Ebsterstadt argues, \u201cbelieve similarly that women are always and everywhere available and interested.\u201d\n\nThis is an exaggerated claim, but her argument is supported by facts in such stories as the Aziz Ansari scandal , which weaseled its way into the #MeToo movement despite involving behavior much less egregious than, say, Harvey Weinstein's outrages.\n\nThe decline of religion plays a role too, but not the one you'd expect. Instead of dwelling on religion\u2019s traditional constraints on sexual promiscuity, Eberstadt laments that we've lost the ability or inclination, once provided by religious faith, to see members of the opposite sex as brothers and sisters, rather than purely as sexual beings. Now, \u201canother healthy bond between the sexes has been frayed.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the book, Ebsterstadt includes commentary from varied sources \u2014 Rod Dreher, author of The Benedict Option, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, and Mark Lilla, author of The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics \u2014 addressing the same issue from different angles.\n\nTheir commentary solidifies Ebsterstadt\u2019s commitment to non-partisanship. She does write, however, that if something is to be done about America's identity crisis, it will have to come from the Right.\n\n\u201cNo-fault divorce, out-of-wedlock births, paid surrogacy, absolutism about erotic freedom, disdain for traditional religious codes: the very politics and practices that have chipped away at the family, and helped to provoke the subsequent flight to identity politics, are those that liberals and progressives embrace,\u201d she writes.\n\nWhether or not you believe that the sexual revolution has had as much of a role in the rise of identity politics as Ebsterstadt claims, it\u2019s difficult to deny that, amid fracturing families, people search for new identities to embrace.\n\nAll the lonely people are looking for a place to belong, and more than 50 years after the sexual revolution, The Beatles still don\u2019t have their answer.", "description": "When The Beatles released \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d in the mid-1960s, they probably didn\u2019t mean it as a prediction.
