It has received over 38,000 bookings.\n\nHowever, the Confederation of All India Traders' Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said: \"Vehicles sales have been hampered to a great extent and I believe like other sectors of trade, the automobile sector is also witnessing a decline between 25 to 30 per cent.\"\n\n\"The consumer is suffering from a cash crunch and banks have also tightened financing of vehicles. Moreover, since only BSVI vehicles will be allowed from April 2020, it is making consumers reluctant in purchasing vehicles currently which are of BSIV standards.\"\n\nBCCL\n\nThe festive day, which forms a part of the Diwali festival, is considered to be auspicious to buy gold, silver, automobiles, and utensils in order to bring luck.\n\nBut, the general slowdown which has plagued the economy for a while now, has dented the automobile sector hard, with sales plunging on a year-on-year basis.\n\nIn the past few months, several automobile manufacturers had scaled down their production to deal with the slow down.\n\nBCCL\n\nThousands of people at various levels also lost their jobs due to the scaling down, which forced the government to step in and announce a reduction in the corporate tax rate to boost manufacturing and lift growth.\n\nCar companies such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd have lowered prices on some models in an effort to boost sales.", "description": "The Indian auto industry which has been on a downward spiral for nearly a year has finally got some good news.
