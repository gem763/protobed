The world\u2019s largest global auction for flowers began, famously, in a pub. One trader turned to his peers and asked, how much?\n\nThe question was the start of the most dynamic and highly organised trading sites for flowers in the world. Now known as the Royal FloraHolland auction house at Aalsmeer, near Amsterdam, the floor of a cavernous warehouse is home to a giant game of Tetris with living flower stems bustled about on trolleys, to be bought, sold and dispatched.\n\nAs it has done for years, Royal FloraHolland still plays a critical role importing and then re-exporting 40% of flowers from all over the world. But newer players in the flower trade are making their presence felt, shifting the dynamics of production. As transport technology develops, producers in regions elsewhere, including sub-Saharan Africa, are challenging the Netherlands\u2019 traditional hold on the industry.\n\nThe scale of the global market for cut flowers is large, and increasing. In the UK alone, the market for cut flowers and ornamental plants was worth \u00a31.3 billion in 2018, according to government statistics. Around 90% of these flowers are imported \u2013 the vast majority still coming via the Netherlands. In 2015, the global trade in flowers was worth around \u20ac15bn (\u00a310.6bn), with stems shuttled between continents with breath-taking speed.\n\nKeeping up with the world\u2019s demand for flowers involves an intricate and delicately balanced supply chain of workers, farmers, wholesalers, airlines, cargo ships, traders, florists and supermarkets. Getting something as delicate as a bunch of flowers from one continent to another without them being crushed or wilting is a daunting technological feat.\n\nCut flowers have to be transported quickly using a \u201ccold-chain\u201d \u2013 a series of refrigerated facilities on farms, lorries, planes, and boats \u2013 which put the flowers into a dormant state, so they stay fresh. This allows a rapid transfer from farm to shop within 24-48 hours, if going by plane, says Sylvie Mamias, secretary general of Union Fleurs, the international flower trade association.\n\nTime is critical: for every extra day spent travelling flowers lose 15% of their value. Vase life \u2013 the length of time flowers stay fresh after reaching the customer \u2013 is then usually 12-15 days, Mamias says.\n\nThe biggest buyers of cut flowers are the EU and the US, but the biggest growers and exporters are the Netherlands, Ecuador, Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia. Roses, carnations and chrysanthemums are the most popular blooms.\n\nIn the UK, 80% of cut flowers come via the Netherlands, according to the British Florist Association, although a significant proportion originate in Kenya. Some Kenyan flowers also come straight to the UK on direct flights from Nairobi, where entire terminals at certain airports are dedicated to flights exporting blooms.\n\nOne of the reasons behind the increase in flower exports in Africa dates from the 1970s, says Mamias, when an oil crisis increased the cost of heating greenhouses in northern countries. As a result, production moved south where flowers could be grown with little energy input all year round. For Europe, this meant seeing more flowers imported from Israel and Morocco, and later east Africa, while US buyers developed trade with Latin America.\n\nThese new producers had three things in common: areas of high altitude with cool nights, which many flowers benefit from, proximity to the equator for maximum hours of sunlight, and cheaper labour. The change also meant an end to seasonal production and the beginning of a 365-day-a-year international competitive trade.\n\nKenya is particularly important as a source of roses \u2013 the country supplies one third of all roses sold in the EU, according to Union Fleurs. Cut flowers are now Kenya\u2019s second largest export after tea, contributing around 1% of the country\u2019s GDP. They are also one of the country\u2019s largest source of employment, with over 100,000 people working directly in the flower industry and an estimated two million indirectly.", "description": "The Netherlands has been the centre of the cut flower trade for centuries, but countries such as Kenya are challenging this role.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/the-new-roots-of-the-flower-trade/assets/images/social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
