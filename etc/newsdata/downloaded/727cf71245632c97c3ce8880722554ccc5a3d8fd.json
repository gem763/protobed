President Trump made the announcement Wednesday morning.\n\n.... advantage, and also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars. There will be very little difference in emissions between the California Standard and the new U.S. Standard, but the cars will be.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\n....far safer and much less expensive. Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\n\"We embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,\" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said during a speech ahead of the move Tuesday.\n\n\"To borrow from Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, CAFE does not stand for California Assumes Federal Empowerment. So we will be moving forward with one national standard very soon. We will be taking joint action with the Department of Transportation to bring clarity to the proper \u2013 and improper \u2013 scope and use of the Clean Air Act preemption waiver, he continued. \"Our actions will not impact California\u2019s health-based standards and programs. California will be able to keep in place and enforce programs to address smog and other forms of air pollution caused by motor vehicles. This will allow the State to redouble its efforts to address its air quality problems and finally achieve compliance with EPA\u2019s National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, who knew the move was coming, tried to get ahead of the announcement yesterday.\n\nHi, @realDonaldTrump. Let me break it down in simple terms for you...\n\n\n\nReducing emissions:\n\n-Protects our air & health\n\n-Is good for the economy\n\n-Allows families to pay less at the pump\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re here in the 21st century. Let us know when you decide to join us. https://t.co/gZzUjXeFxo \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) September 17, 2019\n\nInterestingly, a number of states use California's emission standards as their own and have vowed to issue a lawsuit in favor of the regulatory power.
