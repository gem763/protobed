A JPMorgan bot in September released a report saying it analyzed 14,000 Trump tweets and found they're having an increasingly sharp impact on markets.\n\nGoldman said this week that its economists looked at Trump's tweets \"to include not only tweets that criticize the Fed but also tweets that directly or indirectly threaten tariff escalation.\" From there, they looked at Fed funds futures for changes half an hour after the tweets.\n\n\"Markets believe that the President primarily affects Fed policy indirectly by influencing the macroeconomic outlook,\" economist Ronnie Walker wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe bank added: \"The moves in the Fed funds futures market following such tweets are statistically highly significant, and the cumulative impact across all such tweets in our sample is about -40 basis points when we include both tweets indicating escalation of trade tensions and tweets indicating de-escalation, and about -60 basis points when we focus only on tweets indicating escalation.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nSee More: It looks like Trump lied about the trade war to boost stock markets \u2014 his bluster may soon start falling on 'deaf ears'\n\nThe note released on Monday found that there was \"weak evidence for the notion that the market moves its monetary policy expectations in response to Presidential tweets criticizing the Fed.\"\n\nGoldman added: \"Statistically, the moves in the Fed funds futures market following such tweets are not significantly different from those in any given market interval, and the cumulative impact across all of these tweets in our sample is only -10 basis points.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs", "description": "Trump often takes to Twitter to both criticize the Federal Reserve Chief and to vocalize trade policy.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs analyzed just how much of an e...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d9c7828ee40e44658178cca-905/trump-china-tariff-tweet.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
