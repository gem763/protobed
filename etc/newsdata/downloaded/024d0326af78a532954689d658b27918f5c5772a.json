Originally touted as an aid to nicotine-addicted smokers looking to quit, e-cigarettes have emerged as a major public-health issue.\n\n\u201cPeople are dying with vaping. So we\u2019re looking at it very closely,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office, citing the recent deaths from vaping-related lung illnesses.\n\n\u201cVaping has become a very big business,\u201d Mr. Trump said, alongside first lady Melania Trump, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless. \u201cBut we can\u2019t allow people to get sick, and we can\u2019t have our youth be so affected.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also cited 13-year-old son Barron and the first lady, who recently tweeted concerns over children and vaping.\n\n\u201cI mean, she\u2019s got a son \u2014 together \u2014 that is a beautiful, young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it,\u201d he said.\n\nPreliminary data from the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey show that more than a quarter of high school students reported using e-cigarettes within the preceding 30 days, according to the Health and Human Services Department.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities,\u201d Mr. Azar said.\n\nThe ban won\u2019t take effect right away.\n\nMr. Azar said it will take a few weeks for the Health and Human Services Department to flesh out its enforcement plans and details. After that, there will be a 30-day period for companies to remove flavored e-cigs from the market.\n\nFlavored e-cig makers will be able to apply for FDA approval of their products, but they\u2019d have to be off the market until then.\n\nDefenders of e-cigarettes argue that vaping is a safer alternative to regular cigarettes, which contain various toxins, and are a great way for traditional smokers to kick the habit. Mr. Azar said that\u2019s why the administration wants to keep tobacco-flavored e-cigs on the market.\n\nFederal law already prohibits e-cigarette sales, along with tobacco purchases, to people under 18. Under a 2009 law, all flavored cigarettes except menthol are also banned.\n\nBut vaping products with sweet flavors such as fruit and mint have been blamed for the alarming rise in youth vaping. An estimated 3.6 million middle and high school students used e-cigarettes last year, up from 2.1 million the previous year, according to federal health agencies.\n\nAccording to one government survey, more than 80 percent of underage e-cigarette users say they chose their product because it \u201ccomes in flavors that I like.\u201d\n\nGregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the president\u2019s decision to try to ban the sale of nearly every vaping product on the market.\n\n\u201cA ban will remove life-changing options from the market that have been used by several million American adults to quit smoking,\u201d Mr. Conley said. \u201cIn the history of the United States, prohibition has never worked. It didn\u2019t work with alcohol. It hasn\u2019t worked with marijuana. It won\u2019t work with e-cigarettes.\u201d\n\nHe added Mr. Trump should meet with one of the millions of American voters who have used flavors to quit smoking before advancing his \u201cdraconian approach\u201d to regulation and public policy.\n\nThe Vapor Technology Association expressed similar thoughts Wednesday and urged Mr. Trump not to follow the lead of San Francisco, which banned e-cigarettes in June, and the \u201cfar left anti-business extremists\u201d leading opposition to vaping.\n\n\u201cBanning flavors would be a public health travesty,\u201d the VTA said, claiming that a federal ban will force more than 10 million adults to choose between smoking traditional tobacco products or finding what they need on the black market.\n\nHowever Juul Labs, a leading e-cigarette company, said in a statement that \u201cwe strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products. We will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective.\u201d\n\nJuul is under investigation from the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission for its marketing practices targeting younger users.\n\nThe VTA also said government overreach will shut down thousands of small businesses, and claimed there has been no indication that industry-standard nicotine-containing vapor products are responsible for the recent cases of lung illnesses. At least some are known to involve marijuana vaping.\n\nStates have so far reported more than 450 cases of respiratory illness and six deaths tied to vaping. Federal health officials said they do not yet know what\u2019s causing the spate of illness.\n\nBoth Michigan and New York have recently introduced state-level bans of flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nWhile the vaping industry decried Mr. Trump\u2019s latest move against e-cigarettes, health advocacy groups said the decision was a necessary and long-overdue step to address youth e-cigarette use.\n\n\u201cThis is a public health crisis and we cannot afford more delays in confronting it. It has taken far too long to stop Juul and other e-cigarettes companies from targeting our nation\u2019s kids with sweet-flavored, nicotine-loaded products that are addicting a new generation and threaten decades of progress in reducing youth tobacco use,\u201d the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said. \u201cWe urge the Administration not to back down in the face of the inevitable pressure from Juul and other manufacturers.\u201d\n\nDr. Julian Guitron, a thoracic surgeon and physician for the University of Cincinnati, said he is delighted to see that attention to e-cigarette use, which has reached its highest level, and called the flavor ban a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that all focus be put into the vaping situation to avoid any more needless loss of life. Banning flavored products is a good first step, but there is no question that a thorough situation investigation has to be conducted. We are in a situation today that could have been averted by common sense regulation that didn\u2019t take place,\u201d he said.\n\nThe American Vaping Association estimates there are 8,000 to 10,000 vape shops or tobacco shops in the U.S. that feature e-cigs, of which more than 500 are registered with the FDA. More than 15,000 e-cigarette flavors are available on the market, according to health advocacy groups.\n\nScientists agree that e-cigarettes, which generally heat a nicotine-containing liquid, don\u2019t contain most of the carcinogenic byproducts of burning tobacco. But because vaping is such a recent phenomenon, almost nothing is known about its long-term effects.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
