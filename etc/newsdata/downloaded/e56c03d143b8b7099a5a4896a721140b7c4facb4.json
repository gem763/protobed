This drought in my electorate alone has been going for eight years,' he said.\n\n'We can't run away from that. We simply have to get on with it and equip our farmers and communities with the tools to be able to adapt as best they can.'\n\nHe said Australia had a responsibility to reduce emissions and would do so through meeting international commitments.\n\nMr Littleproud said he '100 per cent' believed the science around human contribution to climate change, which is playing a role in the drought\n\n'We can't run away from that. We simply have to get on with it and equip our farmers and communities with the tools to be able to adapt as best they can.'\n\nAdditional support for farmers appears to be edging closer after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg spent three days with Mr Littleproud in some of the worst-affected areas of NSW and Queensland last week.\n\n'We understand this is going to cost more and the treasurer has been quite clear he accepts that,' the drought minister said.\n\nNSW Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall launched an extraordinary attack on Mr Littleproud after he toured through drought-ravaged Inverell last week.\n\nThe federal government has been calling on the states to look at payroll tax and council rates in drought-hit communities, but praised NSW for planning to fund dam-building.\n\nThe savage criticism left Mr Littleproud miffed.\n\n'I was surprised by that. In fact, most of my comments have been that New South Wales has done the heavy lifting,' he said.\n\n'It's sadly been Victoria and Queensland that haven't lifted a finger.'\n\nMr Littleproud also rebuffed suggestions the government lacked a long-term drought strategy, pointing to a future fund which will dole out $100 million a year for resilience and other projects from 2020.\n\nThe federal government has been calling on the states to look at payroll tax and council rates in drought-hit communities\n\nMr Littleproud (pictured) also rebuffed suggestions the government lacked a long-term drought strategy, pointing to a future fund which will dole out $100 million a year for resilience and other projects from 2020", "description": "David Littleproud insists the federal government is acting on a major report into the prolonged dry spell in Australia which he accepts has been partly caused by man-made climate change.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/06/19352878-0-image-a-64_1570340195456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
