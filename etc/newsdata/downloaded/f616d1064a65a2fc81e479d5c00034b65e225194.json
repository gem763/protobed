Jim A. Barker from Twelve Points Photography made the trip as well, shooting a string of cracking local creators.\n\nFor more photography and shots cosplay or otherwise from Barker, follow him on Instagram or through his official page. I've credited as many of the cosplayers below, but if you are or know some of the others in the photos below, get in touch via the comments, email or Twitter and I'll update all the captions. And if there's some extra cosplay from PAX Australia not featured below that you think deserves a shoutout, let me know!\n\nCosplayer: Jessica Cutri\n\nCosplayer: Ashley Sumner", "description": "PAX Australia is the biggest gaming convention on the local calendar, but it's also one of the biggest cosplay events in the country too....", "authors": ["Alanah Pearce", "Gita Jackson"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/10/pax-australia-cosplay.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
