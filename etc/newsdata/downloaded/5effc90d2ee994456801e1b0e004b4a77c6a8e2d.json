REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nMONTREAL (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao warned regulators on Wednesday against sending conflicting messages as they work to ensure Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX is safe to resume operations.\n\nBoeing\u2019s best-selling jet was grounded globally in March, days after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that followed a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. The two crashes took 346 lives.\n\n\u201cInternational coordination is important in all aspects of this process,\u201d said Chao. \u201cThe traveling public will not be well served if there are conflicting signals given by different regulatory authorities around the world.\u201d\n\nAirlines have urged global regulators to coordinate with one another to avoid damaging splits over safety as they evaluate software changes undertaken by Boeing. Some countries have already vowed to run their own independent validation studies before restoring flights.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration met with global regulators to discuss steps needed to return the jet to flight.\n\nWednesday\u2019s comments came as aviation officials from around the world gathered in Montreal for the International Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s assembly, held every three years. Chao spoke on the floor of the assembly, alongside many other countries.", "description": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao warned regulators on Wednesday against sending conflicting messages as they work to ensure Boeing Co's 737 MAX is safe to resume operations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433957514&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1F2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
