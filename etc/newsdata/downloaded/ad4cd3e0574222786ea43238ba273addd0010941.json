An unstoppable force will wipe out all of humanity, most of the animals, and even some of the cockroaches. It\u2019s not climate change, it\u2019s the smugness of the true believers; the brainwashed masses of millennials who will one day be in positions to implement the absolute bat-feces crazy ideas they are espousing today.\n\nEveryone won\u2019t literally be dead, they\u2019ll just wish they were.\n\nThe \u201cclimate strike\u201d is on, have you called into work yet? How much of your weekend was spent in a drum circle with the shower-challenged? Did you participate in any good chants?\n\nIf you\u2019re a normal person, the odds are you haven\u2019t. But we aren\u2019t dealing with normal people here.\n\nThe leadership of the climate cult is made up of adults who privately know better and children manipulated by people they\u2019re supposed to be able to trust. They\u2019re a doomsday cult that continually moves the goalposts.\n\nI wrote about this in my book, in a chapter called \u201cThe Doomsday Cult.\u201d There have always been people who predict doom and gloom, and there have always been people who will believe them. But if one of the leaders of these cults says the world will come to an end Sunday night at midnight, come Monday morning that person is going to have a lot of explaining to do. After having the men castrate themselves, the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult leader at least had the sense to get everyone to commit suicide. It helped avoid awkward conversations with a bunch of eunuchs the day after they discovered there wasn\u2019t a space ship behind the Hale-Bopp comet.\n\nThe current crop of climate cultists learned this lesson as well. After 50 years of making 10-year \u201cwe\u2019re all going to die unless\u2026\u201d predictions, they changed everything. They now make 100-year predictions, which is much smarter, from a strategic perspective. The 10-year game means a lot of people who heard you swear X would happen in 10 years if you didn\u2019t get your way will still be alive to notice the sky didn\u2019t fall. It\u2019s hard to maintain a following when your central claim is obviously proven false.\n\nThe beauty of moving the length of time to 100 years isn\u2019t that it can\u2019t be proven, it\u2019s that it can\u2019t be disproven. People, especially when times are good, have difficulty accepting that they don\u2019t have any real problems. We search for something to be wrong, we crave it. It\u2019s due to, in large part, how easy we have it compared to every other point in history. We don\u2019t have to fight every day for just enough food to survive all so we can do it again tomorrow. We\u2019re fat, have refrigerators, air conditioning, and heat, and can be on the other side of the planet in less than a day.\n\nWe also all have access to the accumulated knowledge of our species in our pockets. You\u2019d think that\u2019d make us smarter. It hasn\u2019t.\n\nBut liberals have gotten smarter, about strategy, at least. The \u201c10 years and we\u2019re dead\u201d mantra may not work on adults anymore, but it works great on kids. They\u2019ve adopted the tobacco company model \u2013 hook \u2018em while they\u2019re young.\n\nHaving lost in the fight to convince thinking adults who remember the last 50 years, they\u2019ve dug their claws into the children. When teachers and politicians, who children are told to trust (and should be able to), tell them their lives are doomed to suffering or extinction, well, they\u2019re a much easier audience to convince.\n\nThose kids are getting older now, becoming old enough to vote. Soon, they\u2019ll be old enough to vote for themselves.\n\nThey have no memory of the Cold War, weren\u2019t even taught about it and the horrors of collectivism \u2013 there wasn\u2019t time after the addition of proper pronoun usage and grievance studies classes. Not having heard them before makes them the perfect audience for the left\u2019s greatest hit, repetition from positions of trust did the rest.\n\nMany kids today are terrified their lives will never really come to fruition; that it\u2019ll all be over by the time they\u2019re old enough to enjoy it. They\u2019re being robbed of their childhoods in front of the whole world, being exploited as emotional blackmail to pressure their parents to accept the will of the left.\n\nBefore it was climate change it was global warming, and the policy solutions were the same. Before it was global warming it was global cooling, and the policy solutions were the same. Before they used the weather to scare people, the same policy \u201csolutions\u201d were being pushed by progressives. The idea of \u201cman-caused climate change\u201d is a delivery device, not a crisis. But kids aren\u2019t taught history, they aren\u2019t conditioned to question the absurd. They are \u201cChildren of the Corn\u201d brainwashed to obey and someday, much sooner than 12 years, they\u2019ll start being elected to Congress. If they don\u2019t wise up soon, it\u2019ll be enough to make everyone wish they were right all along.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "In 12 years, we\u2019ll all be dead.
