But then Ryan Zimmerman came to the plate in the second inning and blasted a mammoth solo home run in his first World Series at bat over the center field wall to cut Houston\u2019s lead to 2-1.\n\nHe got back to the dugout and delivered a message to his teammates \u2014 this guy can be hit. Juan Soto listened.\n\nThe 20-year-old phenom who will celebrate his 21st birthday Friday hit his own moon shot over the left field wall in the fourth inning to tie the game at 2-2, and then, after the Nationals took a 3-2 lead in the fifth inning on a sacrifice fly by Trea Turner, Soto came up two batters later and sent a blast against the left field wall for a two-run double and a 5-2 Washington lead, on their way to a 5-4 victory in Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nCole was indeed human.\n\nSoto may be other worldly.\n\nThe win gives the Nationals a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, and takes away the Astros\u2019 home field advantage.\n\nThe winner of the first game of the World Series has gone on to win the series nearly 62 percent of the time.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
