Especially when his health was declining before his death at age 98, he told me repeatedly how lucky he and my mother were to have survived the war unscathed when so many millions did not. Nearly 20 percent of the inhabitants of prewar Poland\u2014about six million people, half of whom were Jews\u2014perished in the ensuing conflagration and the Holocaust.\n\nWhen my father wrote about or discussed his experiences, or offered his comments on the books I was writing about the Third Reich and the war, he made no secret of the fact that he never could shake a sense of survivor\u2019s guilt.\n\nAt the start of the war, he was what he called a \u201ccadet officer,\u201d an inexperienced soldier in the Polish Army who was put in charge of a tank platoon defending the fortress in Brest, a town in the eastern part of the country. The tanks at his disposal were French World War I castoffs that had been sold cheaply to the Poles; their maximum speed was six miles per hour.\n\nGiven the vastly superior firepower of Hitler\u2019s forces, the Poles never had a chance. During intense German shelling, he and his men survived by hiding under their tanks. While his men displayed remarkable courage and embarked on dangerous forays, he said, he was often \u201cparalyzed with fear.\u201d When it looked like the Germans were about to storm the fortress, he fired his tank\u2019s gun blindly. When he heard later that some of his own men were hit from behind, he agonized over whether they were struck by his friendly fire.\n\nOnce Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union sealed Poland\u2019s fate by invading from the east on September 17, a prelude to the carving up of the country under the terms of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, my father and his men knew they were in a hopeless position. They burned their tanks and joined the swelling ranks of soldiers seeking refuge wherever they could. As he trudged back towards Warsaw, he knew that his young bride\u2014my mother\u2014was probably no longer there, but he was determined to find out what had happened to her and the rest of his family.\n\n\u201cHere we are, you should see us,\u201d he wrote to her, not knowing if she would ever read his words. \u201cWe are running away from the war. Are we cowards? Maybe. But I would do anything to see you again. Maybe that was why I was hiding under that tank.\u201d Arriving in German-occupied Warsaw, he learned that his wife and parents had fled in the early days of the invasion but, initially, could find out no more than that.\n\nIn those chaotic early days, many young men had shed their uniforms and tried to blend back into everyday life. The German High Command quickly ordered former Polish soldiers to report to POW camps, threatening to execute anyone who disobeyed. My father and his army buddies decided to ignore the order.\n\nThis was an act of courage, but he never portrayed his decision\u2014or any of his other actions in those perilous times\u2014that way. But observing him when I was growing up in the \u201950s and \u201960s, I felt he was fearless, never backing away from a confrontation. As he aged, that did not change. One late evening in New York when the crime rate was at its height, a young man snatched my mother\u2019s purse and fled into the darkness of Central Park. My father, who was well into his seventies at the time, immediately raced after him; the mugger was so startled that he dropped the purse, and my father brought it back.\n\n\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d I asked him later, pointing out that the man could have been armed. His response: \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking; I was reacting.\u201d That was typical Zyg, as his friends called him.\n\n\u201c 'I survived, and to this day a sense of guilt sits deep down in my throat.' \u201d \u2014 Zygmunt Nagorski\n\nBack in 1939 when three German officers showed up at his parents\u2019 house in Warsaw where he was staying, they were impressed by the large library, which included books in German that my grandfather had collected while studying law in Berlin and Zurich before World War I. They helped themselves to several bottles of wine, and warned my father to report to the occupation authorities who needed to check out the cover story he had given them. It was a close call, and he decided not to risk another visit.\n\nAlong with a friend from his university days, my father\u2014outfitted with false papers that identified him as a timber merchant\u2014boarded a train to Krakow, with the goal of then reaching Hungary, and ultimately France where other Polish Army escapees were regrouping into new units. Mostly on foot and at times by jumping aboard trains, they made it close to the Polish-Hungarian border. By then, they were a group of 26 soldiers.\n\nLocal farmers warned them that German patrols with dogs were hunting for men like them\u2014and that, once caught, they were either shot or sent to camps. As they were debating what to do next, a young peasant boy offered to guide them to a point where they could cross the border while eluding the Germans. He asked them for no reward, saying that the only contribution he could make to the war effort was to help men like them rejoin the Polish Army in France.\n\nThe boy did so flawlessly, but two months later the underground grapevine reported that he had been caught and shot while guiding another group of soldiers. My father always talked about him as one of \u201cthe unsung heroes\u201d of the war, adding him to the list of people he considered to be more courageous than he was.\n\nWhen he completed his circuitous journey to France, my father donned a Polish uniform again. Miraculously, my mother and his parents had made it there as well, with my grandfather taking up a post in the Polish government-in-exile. Evacuated to Britain when France fell, my father first served in a paratrooper unit based in Scotland.\n\nBy the time his unit made its most dangerous drop into German guns at Arnhem in 1944 and fought to liberate other Dutch cities, he was assigned to temporary civilian duty, writing dispatches for the Polish authorities. \u201cThat call probably saved my life,\u201d he explained, pointing out that so many of the paratroopers he trained with were killed. \u201cI survived, and to this day a sense of guilt sits deep down in my throat.\u201d\n\nNot all members of our family survived the war. My mother\u2019s favorite cousin rests in the Polish military cemetery in Normandy; he was part of the Polish forces that fought there after the initial D-Day landings. My grandfather\u2019s brother, an accomplished architect, was caught in a German roundup of civilians in the early days of the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944; all of them were summarily shot.\n\nBut compared to most of their countrymen, our family got off easy. Which is another reason why my father never could shed his lingering sense of guilt.", "description": "Zygmunt Nagorski served in the Polish army that fought Hitler\u2019s invasion in 1939.
