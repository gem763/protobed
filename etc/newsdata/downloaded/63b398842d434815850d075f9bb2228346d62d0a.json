(Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post)\n\nSome of the best wine finds are from small distributors and importers. They often represent small family wineries, or cooperatives of family farms that are upping their game and producing delicious bottles at great value prices. Here are five from two small companies specializing in Italian wines. We have two pinot grigios, an exciting value at $10, and a beautiful, mineral example that\u2019s worth a splurge; a surprising fizzy red ideal for pizza; and a savory red that was popular in Roman times. And, to round things out, a bottle of prosecco.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nImpero Collection Premium Pinot Grigio Trebbiano 2018\n\nTerre di Chieti, Italy, $10\n\nThis wine greets you with a smile and prompts one at first sip. A lovely, inexpensive, everyday house white, it is great for sipping by itself or with lighter first courses and salads. There are also two reds under the Impero Collection label at the same price, bottled as a private label for the distributor. I hope they made a lot. Alcohol by volume: 12.5 percent.\n\nImported by Caput Mundi, distributed by Impero: Available in the District at Batch 13. Available in Maryland at Dawson\u2019s Market in Rockville, Finewine.com and Gemelli\u2019s Italian Market in Gaithersburg, Friendship Gourmet Market in Chevy Chase, Rodman\u2019s in White Flint, the Wine Harvest in Potomac. Available in Virginia at Crystal Palate in Norfolk, Grapevine in Warrenton, the Italian Store (Lyon Village, Westover) in Arlington, Marchese Italian Market and Yianni\u2019s in Virginia Beach, Vienna Vintner in Vienna, the Wine Attic in Clifton.\n\nPetrucco Pinot Grigio 2018\n\nFriuli Colli Orientali, Italy, $27\n\nIn northern Italy, pinot grigio gets serious. This wine from Friuli, in the mountains of northeastern Italy, is mineral and focused, with ripe apricot and pear flavors . A little time in your glass will enhance the fruit flavors; don\u2019t drink this too cold. The price has probably made some retailers shy away from it, but it is worth the money. ABV: 13.5 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Bravo Wine: Available in Virginia at Aldie Peddler in Aldie, the Italian Store (Lyon Village) in Alexandria, the Whole Ox in Marshall, Wine Mill in Winchester.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nDe'Notari Cesanese 2017\n\nLazio, Italy, $14\n\nItaly has an amazing array of grape varieties, many of which are rarely, if ever, grown elsewhere. Cesanese hails primarily from Lazio, around Rome, and was popular in Roman times, according to Ian D\u2019Agata in his encyclopedic work, \u201cNative Wine Grapes of Italy.\u201d It is rich and sophisticated, with plum and cherry, accented by sage and thyme. Delicious! ABV: 13 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Bravo Wine: Available in the District at Radici. Available in Virginia at Classic Wines in Great Falls, the Italian Store (Lyon Village) in Alexandria, the Whole Ox in Marshall, Wine Mill in Winchester.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nCabert Extra Dry Prosecco NV\n\nItaly, $16\n\nMost proseccos add a welcome sparkle to any occasion. This one adds bright red currant flavors and a long finish. Stock up for your everyday, or holiday, celebrations. ABV: 11 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Bravo Wine: Available in the District at Radici. Available in Virginia at Aldie Peddler in Aldie, the Whole Ox in Marshall, Wine Mill in Winchester.\n\nCantine Federiciane Gragnano 2018\n\nPenisola Sorrentina, Italy, $20\n\nBe careful: This is a fizzy red wine, and the cork will come out with a pop. Gragnano wine is from the Sorrento Peninsula, near Naples, and popular with Neapolitan pizza. The closest comparison is lambrusco, from northern Italy. Chill and pair it with pizza, charcuterie, barbecue, pizza, and did I mention pizza? Anything involving cured or smoked pork will let this wine shine. ABV: 10.5 percent.\n\nImported by Caput Mundi, distributed by Impero: Available in the District at A. Litteri, Batch 13, Pearson\u2019s, Via Umbria. Available in Virginia at Market 2 Market in Alexandria, Yiannis in Virginia Beach.\n\nAvailability information is based on distributor records.
