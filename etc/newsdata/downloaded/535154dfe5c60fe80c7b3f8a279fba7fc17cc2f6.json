Category 5 winds of up to 185mph obliterated entire neighborhoods and triggered a humanitarian crisis.\n\n'I thought no one was coming to rescue us': Abaco Islanders flee Dorian's destruction Read more\n\nOn Thursday Lu\u00edz David Rodriguez, the programme manager for the NGO Direct Relief, spoke to the Guardian from Abaco, via satellite phone. He had witnessed disturbing scenes outside the island\u2019s main health clinic, near Marsh Harbour.\n\nThe clinic has the capacity to deal with about 20 people but Rodriguez estimated there were between 1,500 and 2,000 people waiting in the area around it.\n\n\u201cLots of people are just laying around,\u201d he said, \u201cwaiting to get off the island. People are getting a little desperate.\u201d\n\nIt was too early to properly assess the most pressing health concerns, he said, suggesting many were simply exhausted. Aid groups have been struggling to deliver basic supplies due to the level of destruction. On Thursday, some planes were able to land.\n\n\u201cEverything is destroyed,\u201d Rodriguez said, adding that much of the flooding had begun to subside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Damaged caused by Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco Island, on Thursday.

She did not pull her punches.\n\n\u201cWe are on the frontline of the consequences of climate change but we don\u2019t cause it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the vulnerability that attaches therefore to us is a matter we\u2019re trying to get the international community to deal with consistently.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cPeople say the words and hear you, but they don\u2019t follow through so that I have every confidence. Now that the last few years are beginning to show others that frontline states, whether it\u2019s an island in the Caribbean or states in the US or cities, all of us who are continuously being affected, have to recognise that this doesn\u2019t happen out of the blue.\n\n\u201cThe warmer waters do what? They fuel the growth and the strength of hurricanes.\u201d\n\nSarah St George, the chairman of the Grand Bahama Port Authority, told the Guardian that the \u201cforce and size\u201d of Dorian took everyone by surprise.\n\n\u201cGrand Bahama is not in good shape at all because 70% of it was under water,\u201d St George said. \u201cOn the north side of the island the water was coming up to the second floor of their houses. My assistant Tammy was on the roof of her house for 30 hours hanging on to a coconut tree with her eight-year-old daughter, Ariana. Her grandmother lost her grip and slipped off the roof and drowned. There was no way of getting to them. They\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d\n\nIn Abaco, some dazed survivors struggled back towards shantytown homes on Thursday, but found them razed.\n\nThe small community, known as the Mudd and built by Haitian migrants over decades was reduced to splinters. The people picked through debris, avoiding a body underneath a tree branch with its hands stretched toward the sky \u2013 one of at least nine bodies reported in the area.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t nobody come to get them,\u201d said Cardot Ked, a carpenter, originally from Haiti, who had lived in Abaco for 25 years.\n\nMeanwhile, with winds still at 110mph on Thursday, Dorian was a threat to hundreds of miles of US coastline. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it was expected to gradually weaken through Saturday.\n\nThe core of the storm hit North Carolina on Thursday evening local time, with sustained winds of at least 100mph.\n\nThe NHC warned of life-threatening storm surge, flash-flooding and dangerous winds reaching into Virginia \u201cregardless of the exact track of Dorian\u2019s center\u201d.\n\nThe North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, had urged residents on Thursday \u201cto stay in a safe place and off the roads\u201d, warning \u201cwe have a long night ahead of us\u201d as conditions deteriorated.\n\nDorian swept past Florida at a relatively safe distance, grazed Georgia, then began hugging the South Carolina coastline with howling winds and sideways rain.\n\nAn estimated 3 million people in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas were warned to evacuate. Navy ships were ordered to ride it out at sea and aircraft were moved inland. At least four deaths in the south-eastern US so far have been blamed on the storm.\n\nTrump shows fake hurricane map in apparent bid to validate incorrect tweet Read more\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, a historic port city of handsome antebellum homes on a peninsula prone to flooding, the power flickered on and off as the storm shrieked in and flooding began.\n\nDorian spun off tornados in the Carolinas, damaging homes.\n\nBy late morning in coastal Wilmington, North Carolina, rain swept sideways, trees bent and traffic lights swayed.\n\nAdditional reporting by Edward Helmore and agencies.", "description": "Aid groups struggle to deliver basic supplies due to destruction while the category 2 storm with winds of 110mph threatens US coastline", "authors": ["Oliver Laughland", "Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a081f7e75cd27e5c0b30123245c681317eac6c/0_4_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c2dc35d6c0dae3dfd361475e5c7aa72f", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
