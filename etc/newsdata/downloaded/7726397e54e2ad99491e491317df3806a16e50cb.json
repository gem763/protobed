He asks whether any MPs lobbied for the firm to receive public money.\n\nResponding for the government, Matt Warman said the Prime Minister had had no input into the award of public money to Ms Arcuri's business and all appropriate due diligence had been carried out by senior officials before the award.\n\n\"The Prime Minister has had no role whatsoever in this application.\"\n\nThe government, he adds, would co-operate with all inquiries into the matter, including one being undertaken by Sadiq Khan, Mr Johnson's successor as London mayor.", "description": "CAA flies holidaymakers home; customers and crew 'held hostage' by hotels; 21,000 jobs at risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/4.0.0/bbc_news_logo.png"}
