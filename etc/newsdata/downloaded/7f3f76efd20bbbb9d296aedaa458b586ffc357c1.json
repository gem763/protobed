The anticyclone, which persists as part of the withdrawal, associated with clear skies and sinking motion will make the atmosphere very stable beneath means significantly calm surface winds,\" SAFAR said.\n\nBoth will lead to stagnant weather conditions like low wind speeds, descending air and compressed boundary layer, which favour rapid fine particulate matter formation and accumulation of pollutants.\n\nIt said the situation becomes worse if it is encountered with any additional internal (firecrackers) or external (stubble burning) emission source.\n\n\"In a landlocked city like Delhi, it may lead to rapid accumulation and may trigger high pollution events. However, if local emissions are controlled it will be a good check to observe and avoid air quality crises,\" it added.\n\nBCCL\n\nAnother thing that could make matters worse for Delhi is the stubble burning in the neighbouring states like Haryana and Punjab.\n\nAlready there are reports of isolated incidents of stubble burning in the two states. The number of such cases is expected to go up in the coming days.\n\nThe Delhi government has already announced that it will implement the odd-even traffic restriction in the national capital next month as a measure to keep the air quality under check.\n\nChief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced a seven-point action plan for Delhi last month to deal with air pollution, which included distribution of face masks and odd-even among others.", "description": "Ahead of the onset of the winters the air quality in the national capital and adjoining area have begun dipping.
