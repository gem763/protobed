'He's super humble, super down to earth. It's not easy to keep your feet on the ground when you've been a superstar since you were 10.\n\n'Kubo is very focused, very professional. That's also down to his family, they're very humble and hard-working. His talent is obvious, but the reason why he will one day be a football superstar is his head.\n\n'He sees things that other people don't see, the ability to see a pass and pick a long ball. His intelligence is outstanding. He is very skilled technically but also very brave, he's not scared of the ball and of taking on responsibility.\n\n'He's a natural leader and he's comfortable with the pressure. He has the ingredients to one day be a superstar.'\n\nKubo joined Real Madrid in the summer; he is pictured playing against Bayern in pre-season\n\nMallorca CEO Maheta Malongo has heaped praise on the player and says he will be a superstar\n\nMallorca will be huge underdogs when they host the might of Madrid at the weekend, with the newly-promoted side currently occupying a relegation spot in La Liga.\n\nThat said, Molango is keen for his side to compete with the biggest clubs in the world, despite admitting that they will 'never be Barcelona or Real Madrid'.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his side hosting Zinedine Zidane and his players on Saturday night, former Atletico Madrid and Brighton forward Molango said: 'Real Madrid is just like any other game.\n\n'They have two arms and two legs like all the others. Obviously they have great talent, but we have to try and believe that we can beat them. We want to stay in the division and we're going to fight hard to do that.\n\nKubo (left) is set to play against his parent club Real Madrid in a huge La Liga clash on Saturday\n\nGreat things are expected of the youngster, who has played six times for Mallorca this season\n\n'We don't take it for granted, we're in the relegation zone and we have the lowest budget in the league, but we want to fight to get out of it, and the sooner the better.\n\n'We don't want this to be a one-year experience, we want to stay here for as long as we can.'\n\nMallorca have enjoyed an incredible rise to the top, securing back-to-back promotions, and few expect them to retain their place in La Liga come mid-2020.\n\nBut the desire is certainly there, and with the likes of Kubo among their ranks this season, it would be no surprise to see them pull off another miracle to survive.\n\nPremier Sports have just launched a brand new channel called LaLigaTV, available to stream 24 hours a day via the Premier Player OTT streaming service.\n\nFans can sign up now for a free seven-day trial subscription by clicking HERE and using the promo code 7DAYFREE.
