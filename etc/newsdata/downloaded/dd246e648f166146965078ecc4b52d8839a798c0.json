Morrisons is selling string bags fruit and veg. totes to replace plastic bags. Each bag will cost \u00a31 and can be picked up in the greengrocery section. Stores in Catcliffe, Guiseley, Halfway and Skipton will get the mesh totes first, with the rest of the UK to follow. Each bags is made from 100 per cent recycled cotton and is washable. They can hold around 17.5 pounds (8 kilograms) of fresh produce \u2014 the equivalent of 26 large baking potatoes. The mesh totes' 0.6 inch (1.5 centimetre) holes are tiny enough to contain smaller items of loose produce like kiwis, garlic and new potatoes.\n\nShoppers will use the bags to carry their groceries around the store before weighing each item individually at the till.\n\nAfter paying for their purchases they can place them back in the sack before heading home.\n\nThe launch of the retro bags follows on from Morrisons introduction of plastic-free fruit and vegetable aisles in its stores back in May \u2014 a first for UK supermarkets.\n\nTo help replace the plastic bags, Morrisons also reintroduced recyclable paper bags.\n\nThese environmentally-friendly sections will be established in 60 stores by the end of 2019.\n\n'As we increase the number of loose fruit and veg we stock, we\u2019ve listened to customers \u2014 who said they wanted plastic free bags to carry it home in,' said Morrisons Packaging Manager Natasha Cook.\n\n'In our trials, customers said they felt a sense of nostalgia using the string bag \u2014 as it reminded them of shopping trips of the past.'\n\nEach of the string bags is made from 100 per cent unbleached, untreated and recycled cotton which can be washed should they become dirty.\n\nThey are designed to be both reusable and robust, capable of holding around 17.5 pounds (8 kilograms) of fresh produce \u2014 the equivalent of 26 large baking potatoes.\n\nConsumers can use multiple string bags to separate different grocery items from each other.\n\nThe bags are intended to help shoppers carry their purchases from the supermarket shelves to the checkout where they are unloaded for weighing.\n\nOnce paid for, the items can be put back into the bags and taken out of the store.\n\nThe launch of the retro bags follows on from Morrisons introduction of plastic-free fruit and vegetable aisles in its stores back in May \u2014 a first for UK supermarkets\n\nThe \u00a31 mesh totes \u2014 which can be picked up from the greengrocer section \u2014 will be rolled out to Morrisons stores across the UK later this year\n\nHowever, the bags are not only capable of carrying large unpackaged fruit and vegetables, with the mesh totes' 0.6 inch (1.5 centimetre) holes small enough to contain even smaller items of loose produce like kiwis, garlic and new potatoes.\n\nAn advantage of using the mesh bags to carry loose fruit and vegetables is that they help stop the produce from getting bruised.\n\nIt is hoped that using the bags to carry produce home from the store will help to further reduce the supermarket's plastic waste.\n\nMorrisons estimate that the 'buy bagless' fruit and vegetable shelves launched earlier this year are already helping to cut plastic usage by 156 tonnes a year.\n\nAlongside the string bags, Morrisons has also launch a re-usable flower bag \u2014 priced at \u00a32 each \u2014 which is made from 100 per cent natural jute, a vegetable-based fibre.\n\nThe string bags are initially being trialled in four stores in Morrisons home county of Yorkshire \u2014 Catcliffe, Guiseley, Halfway and Skipton", "description": "The string bags are initially being trialled in four stores in Morrisons home county of Yorkshire -\u00a0Catcliffe, Guiseley, Halfway and Skipton.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/14/18965592-0-image-a-60_1569504479876.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
