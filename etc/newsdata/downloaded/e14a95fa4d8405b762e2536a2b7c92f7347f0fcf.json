Some waved U.S. and British flags, while others carried posters reiterating their calls for democratic reforms.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPolice had turned down a request by the Civil Human Rights Front to hold the march, but the demonstrators were undeterred, as they have been all summer.\n\n\u201cI feel this is our duty. The government wants to block us with the ban, but I want to say that the people will not be afraid,\u201d said one protester, Winnie Leung, 50.\n\nThe march disrupted traffic, and many shops, including the Sogo department store in Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong\u2019s largest department stores, closed their doors.\n\nProtesters burned Chinese flags and tore down banners congratulating China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, which will celebrate its 70th year in power on Oct. 1. In familiar scenes, some protesters smashed glass windows and surveillance cameras at a subway station exit.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Police responded by firing volleys of tear gas and using water cannon trucks to spray chemical-laced water as well as blue liquid that helped them identify offenders, in a repeat of confrontational scenes from the last several weeks of the protests.\n\nProtesters retreated but regrouped in the nearby Wan Chai neighborhood, setting a fire outside a subway station exit and on the streets. They fled again after riot police advanced.\n\nPolice had earlier warned in a statement that the assembly was illegal and urged protesters to \u201cstop their illegal acts.\u201d\n\nThe protests were triggered in June by an extradition bill that many saw as an example of China\u2019s increasing intrusion and at chipping away at Hong Kong residents\u2019 freedoms and rights, many of which are not accorded to people in mainland China.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government promised this month to withdraw the bill, which would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.\n\nMore than 1,300 people have been arrested amid increasing clashes between protesters and police, who demonstrators have accused of abuses.\n\nThe unrest has battered Hong Kong\u2019s economy, which was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. It is also seen as an embarrassment to Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/67/12/762948b8478f9ad05fb7f5090d1c/1155968404-6076986837001-6076982723001-vs.jpg\" true\n\nEarlier Sunday, hundreds of protesters waved British flags, sang \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d and chanted \u201cUK save Hong Kong\u201d outside the British Consulate as they stepped up calls for international support for their campaign.\n\nWith banners declaring \u201cone country, two systems is dead,\u201d they repeated calls for Hong Kong\u2019s former colonial ruler to ensure the city\u2019s autonomy is upheld under agreements made when it ceded power to China in 1997.\n\nDemonstrators held similar rallies Sept.1 at the British facility and last weekend at the U.S. Consulate.\n\nPolice also banned a planned Civil Human Rights Front march on Aug. 31, but protesters turned up anyway. Clashes erupted that night, with police storming a subway car and hitting passengers with batons and pepper spray.\n\nOn Saturday, pro-democracy protesters and supporters of the central government in Beijing clashed at a Hong Kong shopping mall and several public places. Police arrested more than a dozen people and hospital authorities said 25 were injured.\n\nThe clashes amid the mid-autumn festival holiday came after several nights of peaceful rallies that featured protesters belting out a new protest song in mass singing at shopping malls. Thousands of people also carried lanterns with pro-democracy messages in public areas and formed illuminated human chains on two of the city\u2019s peaks on Friday night to mark the major Chinese festival.\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: China\n\nProtests\n\nHong Kong", "description": "\u201cThe people will not be afraid,\u201d said one protester.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d7/b4/e7f58bce4614bb7ea662f090a25b/190915-hong-kong-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
