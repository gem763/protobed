(And as one of the most prolific murderers of the 20th century, Old Joe should have known of what he spoke.) Likewise, losing 20 or even 100 bucks is deeply annoying. But losing $1 trillion? Why, that\u2019s mere statistic \u2014 indeed, to us mere mortals, $1 trillion is an unfathomable amount.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why the political class in Washington \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 reacted to the latest news regarding the federal deficit with a shrug. But they shouldn\u2019t have. The gap between what the federal government takes in and what it spends is now a bona fide national emergency. Yet, the latest news on this baleful state of affairs was drowned out in a sea of hysteria over impeachment, Syria, Turkey and, believe it or not, the movie \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal budget deficit for 2019 is now the highest in seven years, coming in at an estimated at $984 billion. That comes to 4.7 percent of gross domestic product,\u201d Fox Business reported on Monday. \u201cThe deficit is $205 billion higher than it was in 2018, a jump of 26 percent. The [Congressional Budget Office] has warned that the nation\u2019s debt is on an unsustainable path.\u201d Indeed, the federal government\u2019s debt load now tops $22 trillion. If $1 trillion is a mere statistic, what, one wonders, is $22 trillion?\n\nAnnual deficits have only hit $1 trillion four times before, all during the presidency of Barack Obama. Mr. Obama and his counterparts in the then-Democratic-controlled Congress, of course, loved to spend Americans\u2019 money \u2014 they blew nearly $1 trillion on an ill-designed \u201cstimulus\u201d during the first year of his presidency alone. But that president at least had the excuse that the economy was sputtering during the first years of his presidency, hammering tax receipts and leading to large deficits.\n\nWhat makes the current deficit numbers so alarming is that they are occurring while the economy is in rip-roaring rude health. Gross domestic product growth is healthy at around 2 percent per year. The job market is humming, with unemployment standing at only 3.5 percent \u2014 essentially full employment. Wages are ticking up, and with it income tax takings.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? Blame skyrocketing, automatic entitlement spending for the horrifying deficits and skyrocketing debt.\n\nSpending on the three big entitlement programs is routinely growing between 5 percent and 6 percent a year, with Social Security and Medicare outlays increasing by $51 billion and $36 billion, respectively, year over year, the CBO reported in September. (Both of those represented increases of 6 percent.) Medicaid outlays, meanwhile, increased $16 billion from last year to this, good for an uptick of 5 percent. Interest payments on the debt are also rising, not only because the debt pile is growing ever taller but also because interest rates have spiked.\n\nNeedless to say, while outlays on the three big entitlement programs are growing 5 percent or 6 percent, neither the economy nor tax receipts are. That creates a big problem \u2014 and $1 trillion deficits.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem, alas, that Washington, D.C., seems reluctant to address. President Donald Trump had made it clear that he won\u2019t touch entitlements. The Democrats, too, have shown no interest in even basic reforms, like raising the retirement age for certain classes of white-collar workers. The leading Democratic presidential candidates have even spoken fancifully of expanding entitlement spending. But this is an unsustainable situation that can\u2019t \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 go on forever.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
