Robert Biedron witnessed the accident and helped the father and child until rescue officials arrived.\n\nLocal firefighters tweeted a photo of themselves with Biedron, praising him and saying that \"like a real fireman he went to the burning car with a fire extinguisher.\"\n\nIt's not clear if the Biedron's heroics will help lift the fortunes of a left-wing alliance that his Spring party belongs to in parliamentary election on Sunday. The alliance is polling in third place.", "description": "A left-wing party leader in Poland has won praise across the political spectrum for rescuing a 2-year-old boy and his father from a burning car.
