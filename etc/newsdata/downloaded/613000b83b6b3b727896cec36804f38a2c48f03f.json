Now, investors already appear to have a wary eye on elections next year, curbing the prospects of any revival.\n\nThe Ghana Stock Exchange Composite Index, the world\u2019s third-worst performing equities benchmark in 2019 in dollar terms, has suffered as a government-led reorganization of banks that ended this year reduced the flow of funding to companies and drained market sentiment. Even though share prices have tumbled, investors may still be reluctant to return, said Joel Hammond, an analyst at Strategic African Securities Ltd.\n\n\u201cBy next year, valuations would have troughed, but what could delay a take-off would be socio-political considerations,\u201d Hammond said in an interview. \u201cThe banking sector has taken a big hit. It affected the operating environment for businesses and took away government\u2019s ability to spend on growth-inducing areas.\u201d\n\nRead more here about Ghana\u2019s banking cleanup exercise\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cocoa producer has held seven peaceful ballots since the end of military rule in 1992, so investor concerns around elections are largely focused on the risk that overspending by the government will fuel inflation and weaken the exchange rate.\n\nIn 2016, the last election year, the budget shortfall reached 8.7% of gross domestic product against a target of 5.3%, inflation ended the year at 15.4%, missing a single-digit goal, while the cedi weakened 10%. Memories of this remain fresh in the minds of foreign investors, who typically account for three-quarters of market trades, said Ola Warikoru, a Lagos-based analyst at Stanbic IBTC Ltd.\n\nThe numbers back up that view. The value of stocks traded on the Ghana exchange dwindled to 142 million cedis ($26 million) from January through August, compared with 485 million cedis a year earlier, according to data compiled by Central Securities Depository Ghana Ltd. Foreign investors were responsible for 74% of equities sold and a 61% share of those purchased.\n\nThe banking reforms, which reduced the number of lenders by a third to 23, came at a cost to Ghana\u2019s government, which allocated more than 14 billion cedis in bonds and cash to bail out and recapitalize banks. The budget deficit in the first seven months widened to 3.9% of GDP, beyond a target of 3.2% and the government missed its own goal for infrastructure spending by 45% in the first half.\n\nSlowing global growth may squeeze income from the main exports of cocoa, , and oil next year, just as the government may want to fund projects before the December elections, Hammond said. That could trigger inflation and currency weakness, further eroding the appetite for local stocks, he said.\n\n\u201cThe government will spend some more next year because of this thinking that they haven\u2019t built anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how will that be financed? That\u2019s the fear we have.\u201d", "description": "Ghana\u2019s\u00a0Stock Revival\u00a0on Hold\u00a0With Investors Wary of\u00a0Elections", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic7df15f669d8cb3ff7db3a1bb14874abe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
