Fast bowling was very good at certain times and then all these young bowlers came ...\u201d\n\n\u201cBatsmen gave confidence to the bowlers, bowlers gave us amazing confidence that even with 300 on board, we\u2019re always in in every test match,\u201d he said.\n\nKohli, who led India to their first test series win in Australia earlier this year, said it was continuation of the same mindset.\n\n\u201cWe certainly believe we can win anywhere in the world at the moment. You know, if we believe in ourselves, the way we are at the moment, we can win in England, Australia, South Africa, anywhere and that is the belief that we need to carry.\u201d\n\nIndia have traditionally been formidable at home but struggled abroad, especially on lively surfaces which often defanged their spinners and exposed technical limitations of many of their batsmen.\n\nShastri said the team was determined to succeed regardless of the nature of the surface.\n\n\u201cOur motto was to take pitches out of the equation - to hell with pitches,\u201d the former test player told broadcaster Star Sports in Hindi.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s Johannesburg or Melbourne or Mumbai, we want to take the pitch out of the equation.\n\n\u201cWith the batting line-up we have, if they post big totals and then we have bowlers who can take 20 wickets - we can keep taking those World Championship points we are after.\u201d\n\nRohit Sharma was named man-of-the-series for topping the run-getters\u2019 list but Shastri was pleased that there were other heroes too.\n\n\u201cNormally in India, you have two players who hog the limelight. Here we\u2019ve had six or seven payers,\u201d he said.", "description": "India have evolved into a \"multidimensional\" team capable of winning anywhere in the world and irrespective of the nature of pitches, captain Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri said after the side's 3-0 series sweep against South Africa on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443659226&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0OE", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
