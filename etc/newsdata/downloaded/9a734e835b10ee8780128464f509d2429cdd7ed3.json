The indictment alleges Levoff sold stock when he learned that Apple posted \u201clower-than-anticipated revenue and net profit\u201d evading major losses, and it alleges that he traded during a \u201cblackout period\u201d when high-level employees were supposed to be barred from trading.\n\n\u201cThis scheme to defraud Company-1 and its shareholders allowed Levoff to realise profits of approximately $US227,000 ($332,723) on certain trades and to avoid losses of approximately $US377,000 ($552,585) on others,\u201d the release states.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a Gizmodo request for comment.\n\nAs CNBC points out, the SEC charged Levoff in a civil case in February. At the time, Apple told CNBC that after authorities reached out with concerns in the summer of 2018, the company \u201cconducted a thorough investigation with the help of outside legal experts, which resulted in termination.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s indictment is criminal. Levoff faces six counts of wire fraud and six counts of securities fraud.\n\nLevoff began working at Apple around 2008. Around 2013, he became senior director of corporate law at the company, functioning as the \u201ctop corporate attorney.\u201d In February 2018, he became Apple\u2019s corporate secretary. According to the indictment, Levoff was responsible for making sure Apple was in compliance with its own insider trading policy. He was tasked with informing employees of these blackout periods and helped determine who should be on the blackout list.", "description": "A former top lawyer at Apple, who was responsible for ensuring that employees weren\u2019t involved in insider trading, has been indicted on charges of insider trading, reports a press release from the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qfms5vbod3gnb4hxswr4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
