Their two wins have both been away, at Brighton in August and Sheffield United in September.\n\nA Southampton win is 11/5 with William Hill while another option is a Double Chance at 4/7.\n\nSouthampton struggle at home while Foxes let goals in on the road\n\nTaking on teams residing in the top half of the table at home has been a problem for Hasenhuttl\u2019s side.\n\nLiverpool, Chelsea and Bournemouth all left St Mary\u2019s with convincing wins and scored a combined nine goals.\n\nSouthampton have conceded 16 goals this season and have managed only two clean sheets.\n\nLeicester have scored 16 goals this season but they tend to concede goals on the road.\n\nThe Foxes have managed one win, a draw and two defeats away from home in the Premier League and have failed to keep a clean sheet on their travels.\n\nWilliam Hill are offering 17/10 on over 2.5 goals while both teams to score is 8/11.\n\nLeicester are not in love with Fridays\n\nLeicester have an extremely poor record when it comes to playing in the Premier League on a Friday night.\n\nThe Foxes have played seven, winning none, drawing two and losing five times.\n\nThis may give Saints fans some hope and William Hill offer a Draw No Bet at 11/10.\n\nVardy\u2019s form should frighten Saints\n\nJamie Vardy has picked up his form since Brendan Rogers took over as Leicester manager in February.\n\nThe former England striker currently boasts his best goals-per-minute ratio under any manager for Leicester, netting every 113 minutes.\n\nHe already has six goals to his name this season and scored the equaliser in the Foxes\u2019 last outing against Burnley.\n\nWilliam Hill have Vardy to score first at 4/1 and a win cast of Vardy to score any time and Leicester to win is 21/10.", "description": "Betting preview as Leicester could overtake Manchester City into second in the Premier League, but must overcome a Southampton side in desperate need of a win.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/betting/Better-Collective/southampton-defending-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
