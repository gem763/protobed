Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), an NRA-backed gun-rights advocate, dismissed calls for universal background checks even after a mass shooting in his own state that might have been prevented by such a law. His reasoning: he wants to be able to arm his friends.\n\nSituations like this story are why we protect the 2nd Amendment. Side note: With universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves. https://t.co/x60mdd1WW1 \u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) September 4, 2019\n\nABC News reported on Tuesday that the suspected gunman in a deadly Labor Day mass shooting in Odessa and Midland, Texas, had previously failed a firearms background check but had been able to get an AR-type assault rifle in a private sale through the gun-show loophole without a background check. He allegedly used the weapon to kill seven people and injure more than 20 before police killed him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many other NRA-backed lawmakers, Crenshaw opposed a universal background checks bill earlier this year claiming that \u201call of the tragedies we\u2019ve seen, whether Parkland, or Sutherland Springs, or the Thousand Oaks tragedy, or Sandy Hook \u2014 none of those would have been prevented\u201d by a universal background checks law.\n\nThe truth about universal background checks and today\u2019s vote. pic.twitter.com/koigvhKKYT \u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) February 27, 2019\n\nBut now that the latest Texas mass shooting undermined his narrative, Crenshaw made a new argument on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWith universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is unclear why Crenshaw does not believe his friends could pass background checks to get their own weapons or to borrow his. If they are convicted felons who are not allowed to possess weapons, it would seem important for Crenshaw or other friends to know that before arming them.\n\nElisa Cardnell, a Democrat running against Crenshaw in 2020, told ThinkProgress that she strongly disagrees with the incumbent\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t pass a background check, you shouldn\u2019t have a gun,\u201d she explained in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that. This is all part of a repeated pattern of dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from him regarding gun safety. Dan Crenshaw voted against universal background checks because he cares more about the NRA than our communities. We need universal background checks and other common sense gun safety legislation.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1132871393.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"}
