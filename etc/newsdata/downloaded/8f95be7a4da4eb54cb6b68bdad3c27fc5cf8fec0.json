I grabbed her tummy. I was trying to lift her so she could breathe,\u201d now five-year-old Gray told local media.\n\nThe mom-of-two said she was shocked when Andie walked up to her and told her she\u2019d fallen into the pool, TODAY reports.\n\n\u201cAndie walked up and was like, \u2018I falled in the pool, I falled in the pool!\u2019 She was soaking wet and then I looked at Gray and he was soaking wet and I just panicked,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cI flashed forward so many times on how it happened so fast, \u2018cause they\u2019d just been with me not even five minutes before.\u201d\n\nLaura said the incident scared her because she thought she\u2019d taken all necessary precautions.\n\n\u201cWe installed the safety fence and the kids knew never to go out there without an adult or babysitter,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe installed beeps on the doors. We thought we\u2019d taken all the precautions.\u201d\n\nLaura has since enrolled her daughter in swimming classes.\n\n\u201c[I hope] if people hear this story and they live close to the water, a lake or a pool or whatever, that they\u2019d consider signing up for this class because no matter what precautions you take, it can still happen.\u201d\n\nSources: PEOPLE, TODAY", "description": "A four-year-old boy is being heralded as a hero after he rescued his two-year-old sister from drowning in the family pool.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9496/69d8eb584af84003a2e526ed2956cbdd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
