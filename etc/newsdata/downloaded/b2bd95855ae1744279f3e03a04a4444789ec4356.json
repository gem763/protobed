I mean, they are not real glass helmets.\n\nThen again, given the scrambled brains of so many football players reduced to invalids as they grow older, a real glass helmet would have more meaning than this latest exercise in trying to reveal the misunderstood, misperceived, misquoted NFL player of today.\n\nJames, whose lofty ambitions as a budding media mogul are at a good chunk of the reason he wanted to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, said the project is aimed at getting fans to reconsider how they view NFL players. \u201cThe meaning behind it is: All these great athletes that play our wonderful sport of football, will be heard and will be seen,\u201d James said. \u201cBecause they are, at the end of the day, they are people as well.\u201d\n\nThe initiative started off with a film project starring New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley, wearing the aforementioned \u201cglass helmet,\u201d who looks into the camera and says, \u201cI am more than stats. I am more than exciting plays. I am a father. I am a leader. I am here to make an impact. I am Saquon. And I will be seen.\u201d\n\nNothing like starting with a layup, eh James? Barkley, after all, isn\u2019t exactly one of the NFL\u2019s bad boys.\n\nGoogle Saquon Barkley and many entries come up describing in-depth Barkley and his humanity, his good deeds, his personality. There has been a line of reporters around the block waiting to tell those stories about Barkley since his days at Penn State, all hoping to reveal that Barkley is \u201cmore than stats, more than exciting plays.\u201d\n\nIf James really wants to make an impact \u2014 I mean, really get inside the complicated minds behind the facemasks \u2014 he needs to raise the bar. He needs Antonio Brown.\n\nIt might be tough to find a helmet that fits \u2014 or one that Brown likes. But if the Glass Helmet Project is designed, as the promotional materials claim it is, \u201cto reinforce the fundamental humanity of \u2026 football players,\u201d well, Brown is James\u2019 biggest challenge. Sort of like trying to lead a roster of Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA title.\n\nShow us where the humanity is within this NFL player, accused of rape and sexual assault, under investigation by the NFL, resulting from a civil suit filed by his trainer, Britany Taylor; or the latest allegation in Sports Illustrated made by a second women who claimed Brown committed sexual misconduct while he commissioned her to paint a mural at his house for a charity auction; or the list of domestic disturbance calls to his homes in Pittsburgh and Hollywood, Florida.\n\nAdd in the on-the-field antics \u2014 quitting on his teammates in Pittsburgh last year, creating such a stench that the Steelers were willing to eat $21 million in cap money to get rid of him; his brief, strange tenure after signing with the Oakland Raiders and then crazying his way out by refusing to report.\n\nLooking for the humanity there would be a true test of the Glass Helmet Project, if that is truly the goal of your project.\n\nWhat I suspect, though, is the Glass Helmet Project is part of a growing movement within the business in which athletes decide not that they want to reveal their humanity, but that they want to quash critical stories and narratives, using Hollywood production values and carefully crafted scripts to steamroll over any unflattering truth.\n\nThere was a glimpse of that Sunday in the Washington Redskins\u2019 locker room after the loss to Dallas when Josh Norman went off on the media for comments he made earlier in the week about Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott, when he said following Prescott\u2019s impressive performance in Week 1 against the Giants,\n\n\u201cYou stand back there in the pocket all day and go through your first, second and third reads and come back to your first one, OK, cool. Anybody can do that. At the end of the day, he\u2019s been playing well. As you can see, he\u2019s evolved. He\u2019s growing in the system. He\u2019s just taking his keys and picking his targets and throwing the ball on time.\u201d\n\nNorman said he was a victim of the dreaded \u201cbeing taken out of context.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad, it really is, man,\u201d Norman, casting himself as a victim. \u201cThey pin us against each other. They pin one brother against another. It\u2019s horrible how everything gets switched around. But I\u2019m going to take control of my own narrative.\u201d\n\nThe headline, of course, was \u201canybody can do that.\u201d But in nearly every account I read, Norman\u2019s full comments were included. It was a foolish thing to say.\n\nBut there it was \u2014 \u201ctake control of my own narrative.\u201d\n\nIronically, Norman usually benefits from stories that reveal him as a person, from his summer adventure of running with the bulls in Spain to his donations to the Humanitarian Respite Center and his work on the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Norman\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that people don\u2019t know about his humanity. His problem is people want to know when he will play like a $75 million cornerback.\n\nMaybe he needs a glass helmet to help everyone focus on the person \u2014 and forget about the player.\n\n\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
