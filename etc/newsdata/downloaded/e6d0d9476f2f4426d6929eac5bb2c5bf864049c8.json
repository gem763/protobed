Once the home of the New York Life Insurance Co., the recently restored building and its residences meld classic design and modern amenities, according to Raphael De Niro, who shares the listing with Frances Katzen and Christopher Sadoux of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing.\n\n\u201c108 Leonard is an absolutely one-of-a-kind building designed by the most esteemed architects in New York history -- McKim, Mead, and White,\u201d De Niro said in an email. \u201cNothing like this could ever be built again -- the materials and craftsmen simply aren't available today.\u201d\n\nSLCE Architects is behind the restoration of the Italian Renaissance Revival landmark, which was built in 1899, according to the listing. Jeffrey Beers International, the New York-based hospitality design firm, created the interiors, from the residences to the amenities spaces to the refurbished formal lobby on Leonard Street.\n\nThe penthouse is part of the Crown Collection, one of 11 residences on the top floors of the project, according to Elliman.\n\n\u201cIt has a quality of palatial modernism that is awe-inspiring,\u201d according to Mr. De Niro.\n\nThat starts in the great room, with its 15-foot ceilings and arched, oversized windows, he noted. These architectural windows frame views of Manhattan.\n\nThe custom-designed kitchen also has windows looking out to New York. In addition, it boasts marble countertops, Italian cabinetry by Scavolini and Miele appliances, such as a combination steam/convection oven and a 24-inch wine refrigerator.\n\nThe master suite has two walk-in closets, a kitchen and a marble bathroom with a freestanding shower and soaking tub, a double vanity and a soaking tub. There are two additional en-suite bedrooms, as per the listing.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBuilding amenities include a private, drive-in motor reception area with valet parking, a 2,200-square-foot fitness center, a 75-foot lap pool, a chef\u2019s kitchen with wine cellar and media and billiards rooms, according to 108 Leonard\u2019s website.
