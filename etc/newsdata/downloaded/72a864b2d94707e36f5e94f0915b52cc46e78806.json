The risk is on the upside, that we will see prices rise even more from here,\" he said.\n\n\"Vendors are adjusting their price expectations while buyers are now chasing the market.\"\n\nMr Christopher expects Sydney house prices to rise by about 4 per cent and prices in Melbourne to climb 2 to 3 per cent by the end of the year.\n\nCorelogic's Kevin Brogan also expects demand to keep growing, albeit relatively slowly. He said there was a \"reasonably strong number of keen buyers\" and mortgage applications had risen in anticipation of future purchases.\n\nMr Christopher added that with interest rates at record lows few buyers would be waiting for a likely fourth cash rate cut from the Reserve Bank, which many in the market expect before year's end.\n\nEven the federal government's 5 per cent deposit scheme for first home buyers, which is planned for early next year, would have a \"negligible impact\".\n\nBut despite a slight lift in demand, there were still enough dampeners to stop the sort of FOMO-inspired price rises seen at the height of the market from 2015 to 2017, Mr Christopher said.\n\nHome listings remain very low and buyers have been reluctant to throw too much money around given tight lending conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSydney first homebuyers Sarah and her husband Ryan were a case in point. The couple has been looking in the inner city since May. They said they recognised they were looking in popular suburbs, where the sharpest rises have been seen. But unlike many buyers three years ago, they would wait rather than pay $200,000 extra.\n\n\"We can tell there is not too much stock and some people are still paying too much,\" said Ryan.\n\n\"Yes, interest rates are falling but it won't affect us as we don't have a mortgage to begin with. The economy concerns us but it's not the main concern, which is more about not having anything to buy.\"\n\nSydney and Melbourne's prestige markets are doing well, driving the strongest capital gains, Corelogic's Tim Lawless said.\n\n\"This was the sector that recorded the largest decline during the down\n\nphase, with Sydney\u2019s top quartile properties remaining 13.6 per cent below their previous peak while Melbourne\u2019s top quartile properties are still 11.9 per cent below their peak,\" he said.\n\nThe off-market sale of a six-bedroom sprawling home with a tennis court at 71 Kooyongkoot Road in Melbourne's Hawthorn was evidence of the improvement. While the price of the sale was confidential, sources placed it at $10.5 million.\n\nSitting on just under 1600sq m, the property also had a pool, tennis court, cellar, sauna and spa.\n\n\"There\u2019s a complete lack of high-quality family homes in triple-A locations with a tennis court and pools situated on large blocks,\" said selling agent RT Edgar's Oliver Booth, who sold the house with Tim Wilson.\n\nwith Michael Bleby", "description": "Strong auction results in Sydney and Melbourne despite school holidays and grand final weekends points to growing demand, analysts believe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1908%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8ed2b8a8e7eefa48e3c235c07b7cad017201a0a6", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
