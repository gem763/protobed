To me they were just little questions. I have only asked her to get information for when I have had problems.\u2019\n\nWilson claimed she thought it was the same as \u2018asking at the police station\u2019 and later said her behaviour was similar to \u2018somebody checking their Facebook account\u2019.\n\nThere was no suggestion she had access to any sensitive intelligence about crime.\n\nPreston Crown Court heard the first illegal search was made by Wilson in April 2017 after Goosey\u2019s nephew was arrested for breach of bail.\n\nThe offences then continued on several occasions over a 14 month period.\n\nDefence for Wilson, Rachel Woods, said: \u2018Her motivation for this offence was only her aim to simply assist her codefendant and long standing friend who clearly had a complicated family background.\u2019\n\nGoosey asked Wilson to make several checks about a range of offences involving members of her family (Picture: Cavendish)\n\nShe added: \u2018In her mind she thought what she was doing was confirming the information that her co-defendant had already found. She thought she was simply helping a friend.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Goosey, defence lawyer Cecilia Pritchard said: \u2018She is a lady with a rather troubled family but she herself has never been in trouble with the police. She was just someone who felt the need to protect her family in the way she thought she would.\n\n\u2018Sometimes it was just gossip between friends and there was no intention to frustrate any police investigation.\n\n\u2018She thought she was helping her family out, she was going about it in the wrong way.\u2019\n\nSentencing Judge Andrew Woolman said no prosecution or police enquiries were affected by the friends\u2019 actions but said the offences have the potential to cause damage to the police system and information to be released into the public domain.\n\nWilson and Goosey, both of Prestwood, admitted a charge of unauthorised access to computer data.\n\nWilson was sentenced to six months jail suspended for two years and ordered to pay \u00a385 costs.\n\nGoosey was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for two years and ordered to pay \u00a31,000 costs.\n\nBoth were ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.\n\nHow the illegal searches were made Prosecutor Alexander Langhorn told the court how Goosey first asked Wilson to get unauthorised access to the computer data about her nephew\u2019s arrest in April 2017. Later, another nephew was reported missing and Goosey asked Wilson for information. A 40 minute phone call followed, where Wilson relayed what police had found so far. Then when another nephew was arrested for robbery and car theft Goosey messaged Wilson to search for his name. This nephew was rearrested later that day and there was further checks in relation to him. In October 2017, Goosey\u2019s son was arrested for driving while over the prescribed limit for drugs. Wilson used the database to keep her friend \u2018up to date with what was happening in custody\u2019. When Goosey\u2019s nephew went on the run in November 2017, Wilson messaged her friend and said: \u2018Can\u2019t find anything.\u2019 A short time later, Goosey was reported to have been the victim of assault by her husband. She asked Wilson for an update on her case and asked if she could read the statement she had provided to see if it was OK. Wilson said it was excellent. In December 2017, Wilson searched for information on Goosey\u2019s daughter before telling her friend \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019 and implying the daughter had been found with cocaine. In January 2018, Goosey was herself witness to a murder and she asked Wilson to conduct checks. Wilson reported back that someone had been murdered. When there was another domestic incident between Goosey and her ex-partner, she asked Wilson if the incident had been logged. Wilson said \u2018I\u2019ll do some digging\u2019 before later saying: \u2018Trying to find out but can\u2019t find anything\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
