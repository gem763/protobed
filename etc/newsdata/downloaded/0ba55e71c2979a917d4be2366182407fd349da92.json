Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who passed away on Thursday at the age of 68, will be fondly remembered as one of the collegial leaders on Capitol Hill, who forged personal friendships across party lines.\n\nHis legacy on the House Oversight Committee, however, is one of stark partisanship. In opposition, he defended abuses by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration; when in the majority, he tried to damage President Donald Trump by any means necessary.\n\nCummings is remembered for his most recent fight with Trump, when the president called the congressman\u2019s district in Baltimore \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d\n\nTrump was reacting to Cummings\u2019s own outbursts at then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan over the alleged mistreatment of migrant children in U.S. Border Patrol facilities at the southern border. Many Republicans felt Cummings went too far in his criticism.\n\nDemocrats called Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cracist,\u201d pointing to the word \u201cinfested.\u201d As Trump later noted, Cummings himself had used the term \u201cdrug-infested\u201d to describe his own city in 1999, which remains one of America\u2019s most troubled urban areas.\n\nTo conservatives, Cummings became a symbol of an entrenched Democratic political elite, who use racially gerrymandered districts to protect their gatekeeping roles and fail to improve the lives of their constituents.\n\nLong before that, however, Cummings had made an enemy of the president (who was gracious on Thursday, calling Cummings a \u201chighly respected political leader\u201d).\n\nAs Breitbart News noted earlier this year: \u201cWhat was once the \u2018Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (OGR)\u2019 is now the \u201cCommittee on Oversight and Reform (COR)\u2019 \u2014 i.e. no \u2018government.\u2019 Cummings said the new name reflected the committee\u2019s \u201ctrue jurisdiction, which covers both government and the private sector.\u2019 By \u2018private sector,\u2019 he meant \u2018Trump.\u2019\n\nCummings arguably abused his role to create elaborate show trials aimed at embarrassing the administration. The low point was a hearing in February featuring hapless former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who had already been convicted of lying to Congress and was on his way to federal prison. Though Cohen provided no evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Trump and Russia, his testimony was full of bitter personal denunciations of the president.\n\nIn April, Cummings wrote to Fox News demanding to know if it suppressed a story before the 2016 election about Trump\u2019s alleged extramarital affairs \u2014 an accusation based on a dubious report in the liberal New Yorker. Cummings suggested Fox violated campaign finance laws by making an in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign by not running a story it could not prove. Effectively, he was demanding congressional oversight over Fox\u2019s newsroom.\n\nMeanwhile, Cummings appeared to have his own conflict of interest: his wife has a nonprofit group funded by business interests relevant to his committee, but refused to provide information about its funding, as required by law.\n\nCummings took a very different approach to oversight under the Obama administration. When the IRS scandal first broke, Cummings professed outrage that tax collectors had apparently singled out conservative groups for scrutiny. But he later declared the story \u201csolved.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that Cummings himself had urged the IRS to target one of the groups, True the Vote, which eventually won its court case against the government, and was awarded attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nWhen a select committee attempted to find out the truth behind the Benghazi terror attack, Cummings emerged as Hillary Clinton\u2019s number one defender. \u201cDo we want to badger you over and over again until you do get so tired so we get the gotcha moment?\u201d he asked Clinton during her testimony, almost apologizing for the fact she was being interviewed at all.\n\nCummings could be exceptionally gracious: he defended an emotional Rep. Mark Meadows (R-TX) from false accusations of racism hurled by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) at the Michael Cohen hearing, for example.\n\nMeadows remembered Cummings on Thursday: \u201cThere was no stronger advocate and no better friend than Elijah Cummings. I am heartbroken for his wonderful family and staff\u2014please pray for them. I will miss him dearly.\u201d\n\nYet despite his personal friendships with Republicans, Rep. Cummings helped make congressional oversight of the executive branch more partisan than it had been before, adding to the country\u2019s growing political divisions.\n\nJoel B.
