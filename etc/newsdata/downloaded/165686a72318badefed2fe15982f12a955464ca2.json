Here is part of their conversation.\n\nHow does [online abuse aimed at Catherine McKenna and Katharine Hayhoe] mirror your own online experience?\n\nIt definitely resonates with much of the online abuse that we are subjected to as women in climate, as well as, of course, spilling over into real life, in the form of letters and emails and strange phone calls. So it's not just social media.\n\nClimate scientist Kim Cobb says the vitriol faced by Minister Catherine McKenna is common for women climate leaders. (Georgia Tech)\n\nWhat kinds of messages have you received?\n\nAll kinds of things. ... They tend to be short, sweet, abusive, completely lacking substance. And generally you can brush those off.\n\nI find it's the ones that land in my inbox, cc'd to the president of my institution, calling for my removal as a faculty member. Or obviously [there are] the letters that come too, from all over the world: some of them full of tirades, irate tirades, from individuals. And those ones hit a little bit closer to home, obviously, as it took some amount of effort to do that.\n\nWhen this started, how did you react?\n\nI think the first time I was really subject to a torrent \u2014 really a tidal wave \u2014 of online abuse was after a fairly common appearance on CNN, in which I walked through the facts of climate change as they impact wildfires, as much as we know them.\n\nAnd I got back to my office, and my Twitter was blowing up, my email was overflowing, my phone was ringing off the hook. And I just had to weather that storm for three or four days.\n\nIt's one thing to come after me and my speech, or my tweets, or my thoughts, or my work. It's an entirely different thing to start involving my children in that kind of attack. - Kim Cobb\n\nIt really puts you out of commission mentally, because you begin to comb over and second-guess yourself as an effective communicator. And you also begin to wonder how much threat you're actually willing to withstand before you reach for help, in the form of police or your dean or provost to let them know what's going on.\n\nSo it's a very complex set of emotions that kicks in when these episodes first come at you.\n\nBut with experience you get better at brushing them off, because ultimately of course, this is largely confined to people's outbursts far far away and they don't impact your life.\n\nBut do any of the insults still get under your skin?\n\nYes, I mean some of them do. And I really have to express, the worst of them are exactly the ones that were the worst from Catherine McKenna's experience, which is the ones that are somehow involving my children. And that's a line for me, as it would be for most people.\n\nIt's one thing to come after me and my speech, or my tweets, or my thoughts, or my work. It's an entirely different thing to start involving my children in that kind of attack.\n\nAnd so whether it's your children that are exposed and see it, in the case of Catherine McKenna walking down the street \u2014 how horrifying, and very threatening physically \u2014 but also just to be talking about [my children], or incorporating them into my communication. Because that is part of who I am.\n\nI'm a mother of four, so sometimes I get to talk about that. And when I do, inevitably somebody is going to cross a line and start to bring my children into it for extra effect, almost. And those are the ones that get under my skin, and those are the ones that make me afraid to bring my whole self to my work.\n\nDo your male colleagues receive the same kind of online treatment?\n\nI know that they are subject to really incredible and sustained attacks as well. Obviously when we're facing the kind of gendered weapons that we are as women climate leaders, there's a whole other level of harm that can be done to people.\n\nAnd that's exactly why they are leveraging those kind of gendered weapons, because we are people who are sensitive to that, and struggle against that probably on a daily basis anyway, walking in our shoes. So it is particularly disturbing and particularly effective.\n\nAnd I'm glad that we're talking about it today so that people can understand what it takes to be out there as a woman in something as divisive as climate.\n\nProduced by Alison Masemann, Danielle Carr and Cameron Perrier.", "description": "Kim Cobb, a climate scientist and Director of the Global Change Program at Georgia Tech, spoke to The Current about the vitriol \u2014 both online and offline \u2014 she faces as a woman working on climate change.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277761.1568142739!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/threats-security-mckenna-20190907.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
