It's a lot,\" Woods said. \"I've been able to be consistent most of my career. ... Today was one of those days where I was able to pull it out.\"\n\nWoods had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two months ago \u2014 his fifth on the same problem joint. He was making his first start in his 23rd season on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"I can still manage my way around the golf course,\" Woods said. \"I know how to play.
