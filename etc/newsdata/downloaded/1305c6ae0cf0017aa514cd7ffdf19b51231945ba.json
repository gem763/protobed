We walking. Bop. Hit the ground.'\n\n'Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop. I'm laughing. I'm looking ... Bop bop bop bop bop man.'\n\nDwight Boone-Doty listens to closing arguments, left, before being found guilty of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, right, by luring him into an alley and shooting him in the head\n\nOn the day of his killing, Tyshawn (pictured with his mother) was still wearing his school uniform when he was killed by Boone-Doty\n\nBoone-Doty - a member of the Black P. Stone Nation Bang Bang Gang, or BBGs - killed Tyshawn because he believed his father, Pierre Stokes, was a member of the Killa Ward faction.\n\nHis gang blamed Killa Ward for a shooting that killed Morgan's brother, 25-year-old Tracy Morgan, and wounded their mother.\n\nBoone-Doty had been on trial with Corey Morgan, 31, for who the jury have not yet reached a verdict.\n\n'While we await the second verdict, we are pleased with the first outcome of this case, knowing that the individual responsible for this heinous, retaliatory attack on a young boy will be held accountable,' Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said in a statement.\n\n'We hope that this verdict brings some measure of closure and peace for the family of Tyshawn Lee, whom we will never forget.'\n\nBoone-Doty was arrested and charged along with two other men - Corey Morgan, 31, and Kevin Edwards, 26 - who allegedly helped him kill young Tyshawn.\n\nEdwards, who drove the getaway car, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder.\n\nThe recording that led to Boone-Doty's conviction was recorded in Cook County Jail by Demetrius Murray, a high-ranking gang member who had been sentenced to 10 years for involvement in a separate shooting.\n\nBoone-Doty was at the jail on an unrelated gun charge.\n\nMurray testified in court this week that he agreed to wear a recorder in order to obtain incriminating evidence against Boone-Doty.\n\nHe said he offered to help authorities after he heard Boone-Doty's disturbing account of how he allegedly killed the young boy.\n\nInitially, Murray admitted that his first motivation was to get a lighter sentence on his aggravated battery case.\n\nThe nine-year-old (pictured) was hit three times, including once in the head and once in the back\n\nAn autopsy found that the third bullet to hit Tyshawn Lee (pictured with his mother) severed his right thumb, suggesting he tried to block the bullets with his hands\n\nDetectives said Tyshawn was targeted in retaliation against his father, suspected gang member 25-year-old Pierre Stokes (pictured in November 2015)\n\n'My other motivation was that, like, a person that brags about things like that, it don't add up to me,' said Murray. 'It ain't right.'\n\nBoone-Doty lured the little boy into an alley by promising him a juice box and then shot him at close range.\n\nThe nine-year-old was hit three times, including once in the head and once in the back.\n\nThe third bullet severed the top of the boy's right thumb, suggesting he tried to block the bullets with his hands, his autopsy found.\n\nIn his recorded conversation, Boone-Doty is heard saying that he and his co-defendants were at Dawes Park on the afternoon of November 2, 2015.\n\nBoone-Doty said that initially the three men who spotted Tyshawn alone in the park planned to kidnap and then torture him.\n\nMorgan and Edwards then left, leaving Boone-Doty alone, he says in the recording.\n\nBoone-Doty is recorded as saying he went over to Tyshawn and started dribbling his basketball as a ploy to lure him to come over to him.\n\nProsecutors allege that Boone-Doty (pictured), Morgan, and Edwards - reputed members of the Black P. Stone Nation Bang Bang Gang, or BBGs - killed Tyshawn because they believed his father, Pierre Stokes, was a member of the Killa Ward faction of the Black Gangster Disciples gang responsible for a shooting that killed Morgan's brother, 25-year-old Tracy Morgan, and wounded their mother\n\nKevin Edwards (pictured), the alleged getaway driver, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for a 25-year prison sentence\n\n'I don't know what they thinking in their head,' Boone-Doty said.\n\n'I'm thinking in my head, 'I gotta get this b**** off the side. F*** this.'\n\n'I take the ball.'\n\nBoone-Doty said that he offered to buy Tyshawn whatever he wanted at a local store.\n\nHe then walked with Tyshawn toward a nearby alley. He says he looked around for the SUV that he rode in with Edwards and Morgan, but couldn't see it.\n\nHe says that at this point he shoots him in the alley.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation with Murray that was also recorded, Boone-Doty describes the gun used to kill Tyshawn - a .40-caliber handgun.\n\nHe also graphically describes how a round penetrated the boy's skull.\n\n'Dude, because I had the .40. I had like 15 shots and I hit shorty (Tyshawn) like 12 times,' he said.\n\n'He so little. The (bullets) are coming out. I see that b*** go in his head. Boom!\n\n'That b**** came out, right here, like.'\n\nMurray is heard on the tape asking Boone-Doty if he had any remorse about shooting a nine-year-old boy.\n\n'So tell me this, though. This is some real s\u2014t. You don't feel no type of way about killing that kid?' Murray asked.\n\n'They killed my brother...that feelings (of guilt) is for s***,' Boone-Doty said.\n\n'You got to be in this s*** all the way or not be in this s*** at all.'\n\nBoone-Doty's lawyer, Assistant Public Defender Danita Ivory, said that her client's statements were simply a case of exaggerated bragging in order to impress a fellow inmate.\n\nDuring cross-examination of Murray, Ivory suggested that Boone-Doty was in awe of him both because of his size - 6ft5in and weighing 300 pounds - and his status as a senior gang member.\n\n'People say a lot of things, don't they?' Ivory asked Murray.\n\n'When certain people do things, they always add on extra stuff to it,' Murray replied.\n\nClosing arguments are scheduled for Thursday, with jury deliberations expected to begin either Friday or the start of next week.", "description": "Chicago gangster Dwright Boone-Doty, 25, was found guilty of shooting dead the son of a rival gang member after luring him into an alley, after just 3 hours of deliberation on Thursday.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19306522-0-image-a-5_1570207162897.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
