We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nFollowers of MMA have seen this movie before. Twenty fighters have competed against Jones (25-1 MMA, 19-1 UFC). Most, if not all, of these names have claimed they are the one who will hand Jones a loss.\n\nThey\u2019ll be the one who\u2019s the champion at the end of the night. They have solved the riddle and will execute.\n\nNone have followed up on their word.\n\nAfter he claimed his spot as the next in line, Reyes was asked what it was that separated him from the pack. Why should MMA fans believe him when they\u2019ve heard this so many times before?\n\nIn a passionate pitch, Reyes detailed why he will be the one to dethrone Jones. He pointed to his self-belief and mental fortitude as being two of the x-factors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go out there and fight with all my heart,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cI\u2019d fight with all my soul. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I\u2019m not going to squander it. I\u2019m going to fight until the end.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life for this. I\u2019m not just going to go out there and not go for it. I\u2019m going to go out there, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can. I\u2019m going to be in his face.\u201d\n\nAs for specific tools physically and stylistically, Reyes zoned in on his sharp striking ability. According to Reyes, Jones will have to knock him out in order to get a victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got these hands,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t got hands like I\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve got precision lasers. I\u2019m not arching and throwing all this crazy stuff. I can fire like that and knock you out. I\u2019m bringing all that. I\u2019m bringing pressures. I can go forward and backward.\n\n\u201cI got heart, man. I\u2019m not stopping. I\u2019m not stopping unless he puts me out. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019m leaving that octagon if he\u2019s not victorious. He\u2019s going to have put me out.\u201d\n\nWith the victory, Reyes stayed undefeated in his professional career. Weidman\u2019s name now tops the list of Reyes victims, which also includes the likes of Volkan Oezdemir, Ovince Saint Preux, and Jared Cannonier among others.", "description": "Dominick Reyes felt he banished any doubt that he isn't next for Jon Jones following his victory over Chris Weidman at UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Dave Doyle"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dominick-reyes-ufc-boston-5.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
