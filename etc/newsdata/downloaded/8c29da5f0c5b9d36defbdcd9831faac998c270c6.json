Photo: Jenni Walkowiak\n\nTawanda Gona (@tawandus) is a stand-up comedian originally from Zimbabwe and now based in New York City. He has been featured in the Boston Globe and has performed at a bunch of comedy festivals, including Rogue Island, Laughing Skull, and Bridgetown. He hosts a monthly show in Brooklyn called Boyz in the Woods.\n\nThis week, Tawanda and I discussed Sinbad, scoring cheap Jordans in Memphis, and faking his own death.\n\nNY is dope cuz you can leave 15 minutes early or 15 minutes late and still make it to work 30 minutes late \u2014 Tawandus (@Tawandus) September 27, 2019\n\nThis is a dumb math joke and I love it. My dad\u2019s a statistics professor and he really wanted me to be good at math. I\u2019m very okay at it, but I like using math in jokes about dumb shit. I hope my dad appreciates it.\n\nWhat made you decide to pursue comedy?\n\nWhen I was a little kid my uncle Itai (RIP) had Sinbad\u2019s comedy album Brain Damaged. I used to laugh at this one sketch on the album where he played Mike Tyson as a substitute teacher. Since then I always wanted to get into it. When I was 15 I made the decision to really try because it was my passion. Plus I was an immigrant at the time and I thought since comics got paid under the table you didn\u2019t need a work visa to do it.\n\nDo you think that social media has changed the comedy scene IRL?\n\nSocial media definitely has changed comedy. It\u2019s way easier to start a career now than it was before the internet. You have the opportunity to hear from so many different and diverse voices. While some of the comedy can be hella lazy/corny, there are some really, really talented people we wouldn\u2019t have heard of without the internet. D.C. Young Fly, HaHa Davis, and Kayla Nicole Jones are all people I found on social media that I think are really really funny.\n\n\u201cCan I Live\u201d is one of the smoothest songs about anxiety \u2014 Tawandus (@Tawandus) October 3, 2019\n\nI like this tweet because one night it dawned on me that Jay-Z was rapping about anxiety. A lot of people credit Kid Cudi as a big influence on them (myself included) because he openly rapped about anxiety and depression. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve looked back and realized that \u201990s rappers were doing the same thing; the difference is that they were all selling drugs. \u201cCan I Live\u201d is about how stressful it is to be a drug dealer, but I take it to mean how stressful it is to just exist.\n\nIn addition to doing stand-up, you review music albums, mostly rap and hip-hop. How did you get into that? Does your love of music inform your comedy at all?\n\nI love music almost as much as I love stand-up. Rap especially. I see a lot of parallels between rap and stand-up. The album reviews came from this thing I do every year where I\u2019d stop listening to rap for a whole month; I call it \u201cNo Rap November.\u201d People would send me music and I\u2019d write a few lines about what I thought, and I started writing about my favorite albums and things took off from there. Rap definitely had an effect on my stand-up. Even now, I made a playlist to properly answer these questions haha. Watching rappers grow and experiment with flows inspires me to think outside my comfort zone with jokes. I\u2019ve written some of my best bits listening to Gucci Mane.\n\nYou\u2019ve performed at quite a few comedy festivals. What has your favorite one been? Do you think that the current festival circuit is missing anything?\n\nHmm, honestly I like them all equally for different reasons. The Cleveland Comedy Festival was my first, so I\u2019ll always appreciate it. The Bridgetown Comedy Festival was the biggest one, and I saw how far comedy can really go. I got some Jordans for super cheap when I did the Memphis Comedy Festival. I could go on, but I love them all. I think the merch at festivals could be better. A T-shirt is cool, but if they had custom sneakers? I\u2019d be with that. We all want to go to Montreal, but if they had a JFL bottom gold grill? That shit would be flames.\n\nFaking your death used to be so many steps. You needed an RV, some explosives and at least 3 good wigs.\n\n\n\nNow you just need to delete your social media and shut your phone off for like a week.\n\n\n\nYou can even keep the same number, just tell people your name is Jermaine instead. \u2014 Tawandus (@Tawandus) October 17, 2019\n\nI like this tweet because when I first got on Twitter I would use it to form jokes. This one didn\u2019t get a lot of likes, but I know I can say this verbatim onstage, then tweak from there.\n\nBe honest: How do you know so much about faking your own death?\n\nHahaha not too much \u2014 I mean I know where I\u2019d go, how I\u2019d cryptically tell I\u2019m still alive, but beyond that \u2026 actually that\u2019s probably more than the average person huh? But I swear it\u2019s not on my mind that often. Although one time when I moved from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Boston, I spread a rumor that I got deported, which is kind of similar to faking your death. I actually forgot about it till one day years later someone from Wilmington hit me up on AIM and asked if I was still in America.
