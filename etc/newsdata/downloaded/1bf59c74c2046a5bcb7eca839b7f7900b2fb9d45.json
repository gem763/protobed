The married mother-of-one, 33, later died in hospital.\n\nAs he admitted manslaughter at Leeds Crown Court yesterday, the victim's father said his granddaughter Lydia keeps asking when her mother is coming home.\n\nMrs Jaworski-Green, described by her family as bubbly and sociable, died in hospital after her heartbroken family had to take the decision to turn off her life-support machine.\n\nHowlett was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison, half of which he must serve in custody.\n\nRichard Wright QC, prosecuting, said the defendant had denied a previous charge of murder and that the alternative charge had been accepted by the victim's family.\n\nMr Wright said Howlett had taken large amounts of crack cocaine in the hours leading up to the fatal crash on Denby Dale Road at around 6am on January 27 2018.\n\nAs he admitted manslaughter at Leeds Crown Court yesterday, the victim's father said his granddaughter Lydia (pictured with her mother Kate) keeps asking when her mother is coming home\n\nHe had been funding his habit by dealing drug and had consumed a bottle of spirits, but after he ran out of crack he became more aggressive and had talked about ending his life.\n\nWhile driving the BMW a tyre came off and sparks were flying but he continued for a total of 20 miles.\n\nDuring the drive he told a friend on the phone that he had already crashed twice and wanted to kill himself and that he intended to 'crash properly'.\n\nMr Wright told the court: 'Kate would not have had any idea, in the dark, that a car was in her lane, not until the moment of impact.'\n\nAfter the crash Howlett showed no concern for the other driver but instead made attempts to get rid of drugs in the car and his phone.\n\nMrs Jaworski-Green, of Scissett, was cut free by firefighters but her injuries were not survivable.\n\nHer father Paul paid an emotional tribute in a victim impact statement which he bravely read out to a packed courtroom.\n\nMrs Jaworski-Green, described by her family as bubbly and sociable, died in hospital after her heartbroken family had to take the decision to turn off her life-support machine\n\nMr Jaworski said his granddaughter Lydia, who was two at the time, continued to ask when her mummy was coming home.\n\n'The loss of Lydia's mummy is heartbreaking. We can see her thinking 'how come my mummy has left me?'\n\n'Lydia said that when mummy has her car fixed she can come home. It appears that Lydia thinks that one day mummy will come home.'\n\nMr Jaworski said he still felt guilt at having to take the decision to allow his daughter's life-support machine to be turned off, despite feeling that they hadn't properly said goodbye.\n\nHe added that his daughter's husband, Chris, still hadn't come to terms with his loss.\n\n'October 4 would have been their sixth wedding anniversary. We are all truly living a life sentence.'\n\nHe said the death of his daughter was the 'cruellest thing that can happen in life.'\n\nMr Justice Butcher said Howlett, of Normanton, had taken the life of a complete stranger by his 'entirely selfish, inhumane and irresponsible actions'.\n\nThe judge described Mrs Jaworski-Green as an intelligent, ambitious and bubbly woman who felt intense joy in being a mother.\n\nHe added: 'This is a terrible case of wasted life. You deliberately drove your car into a headlong collision with that of a complete stranger to you.\n\nLittle Lydia is pictured with her mother Kate Jaworski-Green, who was killed driving to work on January 27 2018\n\n'You were intending to kill yourself. You killed her. She was innocently driving her Kia when you drove straight into her.\n\n'She sustained appalling injuries and tragically died on January 29.'\n\nHowlett, who supported himself in the dock with crutches, suffered serious injuries in the crash.\n\nThe judge also disqualified him from driving for four years. Howlett will also be required to sit an extended driving test before he can regain a driving licence.\n\nDet Insp Paul Conroy, of the Major Collision and Enquiry Team, said: 'This has been an absolutely dreadful case in which the incomprehensible actions of one man have taken the life of a much loved daughter, wife and mother.\n\n'Only Howlett knows what went through his mind in the early hours of that morning but the awful consequences of his behaviour are tragically clear for all to see.\n\n'He had taken a cocktail of drink and drugs which he must have known would render him completely unfit to be behind the wheel.\n\n'We also know from a phone call he made to a friend while driving that he intended to strike Kate's car as it drew closer.\n\n'Kate didn't know Jordan Howlett but it was her awful fate to have been the stranger whose car he decided at random to crash into.\n\n'In that act of inexplicable madness he took away an ambitious, intelligent, 33-year-old mother of a two-year-old daughter who we know loved life and her family.\n\n'They have spoken very movingly of their love for her and the joy she brought to all their lives.\n\n'We can only hope seeing the case brought to a resolution at court and seeing Howlett behind bars will bring them some small measure of comfort for Kate's family, but cannot imagine the pain they are continuing to still suffer.\n\n'They have told us they are living a life sentence of loss and our thoughts continue to be with them.'", "description": "Jordan Howlett, 24, had smoked crack cocaine and been drinking spirits at a party in Leeds in the early hours of January 27 last year.
