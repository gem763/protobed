We wanted to find best overall garden and best small garden \u2013 including window boxes and planters. And that\u2019s because we felt these were what you, the Mirror readers, really cared about.\n\nOnce again we have been delighted by the massive bag of entries and we\u2019ve taken the time to read and review every single one.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that while the country may be in political turmoil, gardening is thriving, and as a nation we love colour, the craft of gardening, the memories associated with it and the sense of community that creating a great garden can bring.\n\nIt\u2019s tough being a judge. Because while it\u2019s a great privilege to look at your creativity, it\u2019s hard selecting winners from such a postbag of passion.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nIn each and every case what I\u2019m looking for is the soul of the garden \u2013 that image, those sentiments which let me know that these Edens are our Top of the Plots.\n\nAs with every postbag there are snippets from others that I\u2019d love to share with you.\n\nI loved Patricia Olds\u2019 letter about her garden in Whitley Bay in North Tyneside being \u201cbalm for the soul\u201d.\n\nHer late husband Peter loved the garden and inspired her interest in it. Since he died, Patricia finds great comfort in tending it, working among the trees and shrubs he had planted, each with a memory, which makes her feel close to him.\n\nRoy and Rita Cooper shared with us the delightful story of how over the last 24 years they transformed the front garden of their Suffolk cottage in Stowupland, which leads out onto the village green, into an intriguing garden of pavilions, koi carp pools, terraces and lush colourful planting.\n\nIn all that time they\u2019ve only taken two holidays \u2013 their devotion to their garden is total.\n\nI can pick out the evidence of trends in British gardening over that time, from Alan Titchmarsh\u2019s Barleywood Blue to my own love of tree ferns. This is a history of recent gardening in a capsule.\n\nPhilip Canter in Chippenham, Wilts, has a lovely wavy lawn, a green carpet with \u00adherbaceous borders on either side to transport you to an enticing seat at the end, while Zena Everest of Crawley, West Sussex, sent an image of her crisp American-style garden which she and her husband have developed over the last 20 years.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nIt wraps around the house on two levels, and Zena tells us that her particular delight is the unexpected vistas that it opens up.\n\nIt is packed with bulbs and perennials, but what really stands out are the trees and shrubs, and the perfectly maintained lawn which acts like a sharp pool of green as it helps the eye meander around and through the plot.\n\nSince 2011, every Tuesday morning Grace Edwards and a group of \u00advolunteers in the Growing Together Community Garden gather at the library in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. They\u2019ve created a haven for urban wildlife, attracting birds, butterflies and bees.\n\nThis community spirit brings people together, builds confidence for each \u00adindividual, and helps them through stresses in their own lives.\n\nIt\u2019s the power of gardening in action.\n\nGarden of the Year\n\nThis year\u2019s winner is Mary Price from Rhondda, South Wales, and her own words explain what her garden means to her better than any judge can: \u201cThe garden is my world in every season. Working in it keeps me young and well.\n\n\u201cI find it therapeutic and uplifting. The garden is never without birds, butterflies and bees.\n\n\u201cWithout boasting, it\u2019s admired by all around, and friends and neighbours come often to enjoy it.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n\u201cI am 79 years young and require no help with the garden generally, except to trim wisteria and other high growers as I\u2019m quite short. I do not in any way think of being a winner, but I have so enjoyed the journey.\u201d\n\nI recognise the sentiments about gardening keeping you young and healthy. Gardens aren\u2019t always going to be picture perfect \u2013 it takes hard work, skill and hope to keep going.\n\nMary\u2019s cottage garden is a wonderland. It doesn\u2019t bother with trends, it appreciates the simplicity of an old crazy paving patio leading to a happy looking shed. It welcomes the hills beyond as an integral feature to the overall design and the washing line is as important as any hydrangea.\n\nAt a glance I see shrubs, bulbs, annuals and climbers all in flower simultaneously. This is an explosion of colour which demonstrates the knowledge and skill that has created it.\n\nThere\u2019s a humility in its sharing \u2013 Mary doesn\u2019t regard it or expect it to be a winner but to my mind it\u2019s a true winner in every sense of the word.\n\nSmall Garden of the Year\n\nOur Small Garden of the Year winner is Michaela Parker, who gardens in front of a ground-floor flat in Whitby, North Yorkshire. With the help of her mum, each year she grows a joyful riot of colour from seed. Her garden is in pots and containers.\n\nHanging baskets with petunias flank the bay window, a purple cordyline explodes like a firework.\n\nThe whole effect is a layered theatre set.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nPots are propped up on tables, a window trough overflows with lobelia, sweet peas scramble for freedom from a big tub, and sedum, geraniums, pelargoniums, marigolds, fuchsia and delphiniums complete the layer line-up. There\u2019s even some tomato plants among the coloured revelry and the whole collection brings joy to bees, butterflies and passers-by.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable what can be achieved in such a small space and the placement of the pots, the staging and the sharing aspect of this garden makes it our winner.", "description": "This years' competition was split into two categories 'best overall garden and best small garden' \u2013 including window boxes and planters", "authors": ["Diarmuid Gavin", "Image", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562248.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Gardening.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
