Absolutely. Should it be accessible? Absolutely,\u201d abortion rights activist Pamela Merritt told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut we don\u2019t get there by framing it as a horrible thing a woman should have to endure a certain level of debasement and violence to be worthy of.\u201d\n\nAmelia Bonow, the creator of the viral #shoutyourabortion hashtag, was more explicit.\n\n\u201cHOW DID YOU GET THAT JOB AND WHY IN THE FUCK DID YOU WANT IT,\u201d she tweeted at the former Planned Parenthood head.\n\nWen dug in further in a tweet on Wednesday, calling her statements a \u201crational view of abortion and adding, \u201cPro-choice & progressive movements will lose unless we allow more people to join who do not agree 100% with the most extreme ideology.\u201d\n\nWen was removed from her job at Planned Parenthood in July, over what she said was a fundamental disagreement about whether the organization should focus on abortion rights advocacy or health-care services. In an open letter, she wrote that she joined Planned Parenthood to advocate for a \u201cbroad range of public health policies,\u201d but that the board had decided to \u201cdouble down on abortion rights advocacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the traditional approach has been through prioritizing advocating for abortion rights, I have long believed that the most effective way to advance reproductive health is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one,\u201d she wrote in a New York Times editorial at the time.\n\nPlanned Parenthood employees, meanwhile, maintained that it was possible\u2014and even necessary\u2014to continue both advocating for abortion rights and providing healthcare services. Alexis McGill Johnson, who replaced Wen as acting president of Planned Parenthood, wrote in her own op-ed that abortion has been \u201cdemonized and politicized, putting at risk sexual and reproductive health care for millions of people.\u201d She added, \u201cWe will fight anyone who attempts to politicize that care.\"\n\nThe phrase \u201csafe, legal and rare\u201d was coined by Bill Clinton in 1996, in an attempt to appease reproductive rights activists while mollifying right-wingers with ethical qualms about abortion. The wording was quickly picked up by many on the left, and even repeated by Hillary Clinton in her own 2008 presidential run. (The former first lady took the liberty of adding: \u201cAnd by rare, I mean rare.\u201d)\n\nBut activists have pushed politicians to drop the term in recent years, arguing that abortion should be treated like any other medical procedure\u2014not stigmatized through a modifier like \u201crare.\u201d\n\nThis messaging tells those of us who\u2019ve had abortions that we did something wrong to need an abortion and we shouldn\u2019t do it again,\u201d tweeted prominent activist Renee Bracey Sherman. \u201cThis messaging negates the fact that people need abortions for a myriad of reasons, which we explain every time we share our abortion stories.\u201d\n\nThe phrase has largely been replaced with slogans like Barrow\u2019s \u201cShout your abortion\u201d or ReproAction\u2019s \u201cWe love abortion.\u201d Even the Democratic party dropped the word \u201crare\u201d from its reproductive rights platform in 2012, instead saying abortion should be \u201csafe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood has also moved away from the \u201csafe, legal and rare\u201d framework in recent years, towards what past president Cecile Richards called \u201csafe, legal, and fair.\u201d The organization has removed language from its website claiming that abortion made up only three percent of its services and recently issued a statement saying they were \u201cproud to offer safe, legal abortion to those who need it.\u201d\n\nMerritt, who previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Missouri said Wen\u2019s embrace of \u201csafe, legal and rare\u201d abortions made it clear that the doctor was a poor fit for the organization.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate problem with that kind of framing ... is that it really is a slam and a disrepsect to every single person who\u2019s had an abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd ultimately that means Dr. Wen was slamming and disrespecting one out of three women in America.\u201d", "description": "Reproductive rights activists are furious, saying \u201csafe, legal, rare\u201d phrase stigmatizes the procedure.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571247161/191016-Tulsi-Wen-abortion_lr1nhx", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
