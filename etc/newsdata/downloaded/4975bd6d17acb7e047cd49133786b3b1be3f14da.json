None of the artists who signed on to the letter appear to be on the lineup for the festival, and other big names, including Foo Fighters and Kacey Musgraves, are still scheduled to perform.\n\nThe musicians are calling on Amazon to end its existing contracts with ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement \u2014 the federal agency that runs shelters for unaccompanied migrant children \u2014 as well as with military and law enforcement entities. They\u2019re also asking Amazon to stop working with companies that work with ICE and similar agencies, including the data services company Palantir, which immigration advocates have protested over its ties to the Trump administration.\n\nImmigrants\u2019 rights advocates have been calling on Amazon and Palantir to end their contracts with federal immigration agencies for over a year to no avail. Protesters with Jews Against ICE occupied an Amazon bookstore in Manhattan in August. That same month, workers at Whole Foods \u2014 which Amazon owns \u2014 released a statement decrying the company\u2019s work with Palantir and ICE.\n\nAfter Amazon announced its plan to open a new office in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens in late 2018, activists called on the city and the state to kill the deal, partly because of the company\u2019s ICE contracts. Amazon eventually scrapped its plan to open an office in Queens, but the company hasn\u2019t stopped working with Palantir or the federal government.\n\nCover: Coinciding with Prime Day, demonstrators gather in Madison Square Park before marching towards Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, Manhattan apartment to protest Amazon technology being used by the Department of Homeland Security.
