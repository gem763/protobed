Qantas told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n", "description": "Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has been blasted for hypocrisy, having been outspoken on some social issues while helping the Australian government deport asylum seekers.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/02/19767932-0-image-a-4_1571190211304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
