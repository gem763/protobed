And he did it all in only 28 minutes of a 121-99 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns had another monster game to help the @Timberwolves improve to 2-0\n\n\n\nHighlights \u2193 pic.twitter.com/qVkQbixUxb \u2014 FOX Sports North (@fsnorth) October 26, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat outburst came after a 36-point, 14-rebound and 3-assist opener against the Brooklyn Nets, a thrilling overtime win for the Timberwolves.\n\nThe Timberwolves ended the offseason clearly looking like their only shot at the playoffs is Towns carrying them all season, and so far that\u2019s been working out. The team has topped 120 points in both games to open the season for the first time in franchise history and Towns has been looking like the do-everything center \u2014 posting up, shooting, dribbling, passing \u2014 on offense.\n\nAny kind of leap would be a continuation of Towns\u2019 second-half breakout last season, in which he averaged 28.1 points, 13.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists after last year\u2019s All-Star Break.\n\nTowns will get another good chance for a big night against a Jimmy Butler-less Miami Heat team next game, then easily his biggest test on Oct. 30 against Joel Embiid and Al Horford with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now though, all he\u2019s going to do is dance.\n\nIt's early, but Karl-Anthony Towns is looking like a different player.
