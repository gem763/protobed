Now the highest paid female boss in the FTSE 100, she took over at the drugs group in 2017 and immediately launched into a huge overhaul.\n\nHer latest step is the sale of two anti-rabies vaccines for around \u00a3822m to a Danish-based biotech firm.\n\nThe backdrop to this deal is that she is in the process of an \u00a380 billion break-up of the company, which makes the demerger of asset manager M&G from the Pru look small beer. Selling these vaccines brings in a bit of extra cash.\n\nTaking the initiative: In her time at the helm of GSK Emma Walmsley has made a string of bold moves\n\nShe plans to spin off the consumer health division, which is being merged with the equivalent business at US giant Pfizer, which will be floated on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe remaining business will concentrate on drugs and vaccines.\n\nIn her time at the helm she has made a string of bold moves. There was the buyout of a \u00a39.2 billion stake owned by Swiss pharma company Novartis and the purchase of US cancer drug business Tesaro for \u00a34 billion. She has invested \u00a3240m in genetics firm 23andme, in a drive to put GSK at the front of cutting-edge drug development, and she has been on a hiring spree, taking on big name Hal Barron.\n\nWalmsley is unpicking much of the strategy of her predecessor, Andrew Witty.\n\nIs she on the right track? Doubters point to the sheer operational slog of all this hyperactivity.\n\nNeil Woodford, the disgraced fund manager, advocated the split, which will now be seen as no recommendation. It would also be preferable if Walmsley were not chairing the consumer business ahead of the spin-off, though an independent chairman will be installed after the demerger.\n\nAs all this is going on, she is to take on a job as a non-executive director of Microsoft in a move that takes multi-tasking to a different plane. This has logic in the sense that there is increasing overlap between big data, artificial intelligence and drug development, but it is also a serious commitment in her already busy diary.\n\nGSK's plans have wider ramifications: if Walmsley succeeds it will boost the country's success in pharma, where we already have a strong record. Exactly what we need post-Brexit. Once we are past the interminable wrangling.\n\nPlease release me\n\nLiving longer is a blessing, but not an unmixed one.\n\nMore of us are living alone in later life, due to silver-splitter divorce and lower mortality rates: soon, more than 4m over-65s will be singletons.\n\nMaintaining a solo household is more expensive than living as a couple, so this is expected to lead to greater demand for equity-release products, according to the trade body for providers.\n\nSeparate numbers from the Office for National Statistics suggest the number of over 85s will double by 2044. These are both developments that point to the need for a major rethink of financial assumptions.\n\nThe idea that people could retire in their early 60s on a hefty pension and pass on an inheritance to their adult children is coming under challenge.\n\nMany of our big insurers and mortgage lenders are working on equity release products, which may be suitable for some.\n\nAlready, however, regulators are seeing complaints of mis-selling and other stings, such as early repayment charges or heirs who feel their parents were vulnerable and talked into taking out equity release against their best interests. City watchdogs need to be on the alert \u2013 for once \u2013 as it is in this zone that the next scandals are most likely fermenting.\n\nGender audit\n\nFigures from accountancy watchdog the Financial Reporting Council suggest the profession is riddled with sexism, among its other problems.\n\nOnly 17 per cent of partners are female. A woeful statistic considering women make up nearly half of the roles at manager level and large numbers of new recruits. The big firms are trying to become more diverse in their hiring, particularly by taking on non-graduates who may baulk at taking on student loans.\n\nIf having more women at the top makes the auditors better at spotting fraud and losses, bring it on.", "description": "Her latest step is the sale of two anti-rabies vaccines for around \u00a3822m to a Danish-based biotech firm.
