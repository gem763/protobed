Just for like a year.'\"\n\nKutcher\u2019s response?\n\n\"He goes, 'I would kill you,'\" she shared.\n\nSince Kunis isn\u2019t contemplating joining the Bravo series for at least another decade, there\u2019s still time for Kutcher, 41, to change his tune.\n\nIn the meantime, the actress will continue enjoying watching the series, which follows the lives, loves and drama of a group of Beverly Hills socialites.\n\nDuring the podcast, Kunis played a RHOBH-themed version of the game, Marry, Shag, Kill, saying she would marry Kyle Richards\u2019 husband, Mauricio Umansky; sleep with Lisa Rinna\u2019s husband, Harry Hamlin, and kill Dorit Kemsley\u2019s husband, PK Kemsley.\n\nKunis, 36, also played a round focused on the ladies of the show.\n\n\"I would murder Dorit,\u201d she said, before explaining her decision. \u201cShe seems very high-maintenance and she would be very expensive to get married to. We're on a budget! I would marry Kyle Richards and then I would have fun with Lisa Rinna. I feel like Lisa Rinna is a little more feisty. She would be really fun for a night.\"\n\nDespite all the TV talk, Kunis said that doesn\u2019t watch a lot of shows, tending to fall asleep in front of the screen.\n\n\"I don't watch TV. I can honestly say I don't watch television,\u201d she said. \u201cI watch one show a week, because I keep falling asleep. Or maybe two. I watch Bachelor in Paradise or 90210 and both of those shows last me an entire week. I'm very delayed.\"\n\nKunis' love for Bachelor Nation is well-documented, with the star even having appeared on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season of The Bachelorette in 2017.\n\nSee more on Kunis and Kutcher below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMila Kunis Dyes Her Hair Blonde and Turquoise Following Ashton Kutcher's Tweet\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis Have Baseball Date Night Ahead of Demi Moore\u2019s Memoir Release\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis Perform 'La Vaca Lola' in Adorable Kitchen Concert\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Kutcher wasn't exactly thrilled about Kunis' reality television plans.", "authors": ["Leena Tailor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5LvHImduedMbCvmVXTN_yg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/7f0a3e7a7b2b0d0959f2a442773f022c", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
