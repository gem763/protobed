That\u2019s the question the Supreme Court will consider Tuesday when it hears arguments in Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nThe Supremes\u2019 answer could have enormous implications for women\u2019s rights.\n\nHarris Funeral Homes has helped families in Detroit navigate the grieving process for more than a century. To be as unobtrusive as possible, the directors at this family-owned business follow a basic dress code: Men wear dark business suits; women wear skirt suits. The dress code complies with federal law.\n\nFor six years, Anthony Stephens followed it. Then he \u00adannounced that he would take a two-week vacation and returned to work dressed as a woman \u00adgoing by the name Aimee.\n\nThe owners faced a dilemma: They cared about Stephens; they also cared about the grieving families they served. They had concerns about how Stephens\u2019 dressing as a woman would affect clients\u2019 grieving. Also problematic were the funeral home\u2019s single-sex bathrooms: Should they make female \u00ademployees and guests share a bathroom with Stephens?\n\nUltimately they decided to let Stephens go. Then they got sued for sex discrimination.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama years sided with Stephens. President Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has supported the funeral home. Team Trump has the better legal argument.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans employment discrimination because of sex. That means no double standards for men and women: You can\u2019t have a funeral home that hires only men as \u00adfuneral directors and women as morticians; you can\u2019t have an \u00adaccounting firm that promotes aggressive men for being manly but punishes aggressive women for being \u201cunladylike.\u201d\n\nWhile the Civil Rights Act bans these double standards, it requires \u201cneither asexuality nor androgyny,\u201d as a unanimous high court ruled in a 1998 case.\n\nThat\u2019s why bans on sex discrimination didn\u2019t abolish sex-specific private facilities (like bathrooms), sex-specific fitness standards (for police and firefighters) or sex-specific athletic competitions (like the NBA and WNBA). After all, sex-specific bathrooms, fitness standards and sports leagues don\u2019t disfavor men or women. On the contrary, they prevent disadvantageous treatment.\n\nForcing women to undress in locker rooms with men or to compete athletically against competitors with male muscle mass and stamina wouldn\u2019t respect equality but undermine it.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took this point for granted when she wrote the high court\u2019s majority opinion instructing the all-male Virginia Military Institute to become co-ed. She noted that going co-ed \u201cwould undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.\u201d\n\nExcluding women from VMI, Ginsburg argued, discriminated on the basis of sex. Keeping men out of women\u2019s private facilities, however, didn\u2019t. This shouldn\u2019t be controversial.\n\nThe Obama administration \u00adattempted to turn all of this upside down by claiming the word \u201csex\u201d in our civil rights laws was determined by someone\u2019s subjective \u201cgender identity.\u201d It\u2019s an odd legal argument, given that the public meaning of the word \u201csex\u201d \u2014 in 1964 and still today \u2014 refers to objective biological reality, not subjective identity.\n\nLiberal activists have tried for years to get Congress to add \u201cgender identity\u201d as a protected class. Having failed, they took their arguments to unaccountable bureaucrats and activist judges. They failed with the bureaucrats, until Team Obama came around. And they failed in the courts \u2014 until March 2018, when a federal circuit court held that the Civil Rights Act banned discrimination based on transgender status.\n\nActivists want the Supreme Court to affirm this novel ruling. To do so, the court would have to rewrite the law, thus usurping Congress\u2019 role.\n\nPeople who identify as transgender should be treated with dignity and respect. Whenever possible, we should make them feel comfortable. But the price of that accommodation can\u2019t be the erasure of girls and women. It can\u2019t be a law that requires businesses to allow males into female-only spaces \u2014 or that requires schools to allow boys who identify as girls into the girls\u2019 locker room or onto their athletic teams.\n\nThankfully, the Civil Rights Act doesn\u2019t require any of this. The Supreme Court shouldn\u2019t rewrite our nation\u2019s civil-rights laws in a way that would directly undermine one of their main purposes: protecting the equal rights of girls and women.\n\nBiology isn\u2019t bigotry.", "description": "Does a 50-year-old law banning discrimination based on sex mean employers must treat biological men who identify as women as if they are women?
