That\u2019s because of what the communist government is doing,\u201d said the Berlin-based writer, who was jailed for a poem about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and whose works are banned in China.\n\nUmbrellas are the symbol of the anti-government protest movement that has rocked the semi-autonomous territory in recent months, posing the biggest challenge to China\u2019s rule since the city\u2019s handover from Britain in 1997.\n\nThe demonstrations were initially sparked by opposition to a now-scrapped proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China.\n\nBut they have since morphed into a larger movement for democracy and police accountability, and have turned increasingly violent.\n\nChina has accused \u201cexternal forces\u201d of fuelling unrest in the Asian financial hub and has seized on supportive comments by western politicians to back its claims.\n\n\u2013 Call for stronger action \u2013\n\nFormer bookseller Lam, who fled to Taiwan earlier this year for fear of possible extradition to China, also took to the stage in the western German city to plead for stronger action.\n\nHe welcomed a draft US law that would link Hong Kong\u2019s special trading status to annual reviews of its respect for civil rights and the rule of law, prompting Beijing\u2019s ire.\n\n\u201cI hope the EU, the UK government and others can bring in similar laws,\u201d Lam said, calling for sanctions on government officials and police officers who commit rights violations.\n\n\u201cBy placing restrictions on them, by not allowing them to travel into the country or preventing them from investing. That would help Hong Kongers a lot.\u201d\n\nLam was one of five Hong Kong publishers selling gossip-filled tomes on China\u2019s leaders who vanished at the end of 2015, before resurfacing in Chinese custody.\n\nHe and three others were released in 2016, but Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen, remains in detention in unclear circumstances.\n\nOrganisers of the Frankfurt vigil called for his release and read out a letter by his daughter Angela who has worked tirelessly to keep her father\u2019s case in the media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four very long years and I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d she wrote from Sweden, accusing the Chinese government of a harassment campaign against her.\n\n\u201cMore often than not quitting seems very easy,\u201d she said, thanking supporters for \u201calways showing up for my father\u201d.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to him being with us next year.\u201d", "description": "Frankfurt am Main (AFP) \u2013 Chinese dissident Liao Yiwu and former Hong Kong bookseller Lam Wing-kee on Thursday urged European countries to step up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/f4178d_umbrella-vigil-calls-on-literary-world-solidarity-set-an-freedom-expression-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
