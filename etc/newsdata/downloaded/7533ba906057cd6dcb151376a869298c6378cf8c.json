Enter cooling sheets: the crisp, airy bedding that can combat overheating and help you sleep through the night.\n\nBefore we get to the sheets, though, take note: According to the sleep experts we spoke to, sweaty sleep is common, but can have a medical cause \u2014 so be sure to check in with a doctor if you\u2019re having night sweats. If you\u2019re simply running hot, though, cooling sheets can offer some serious relief. \u201cGiven that the ideal temperature for sleep is around 65 degrees, sleeping with cooling, breathable, and moisture-wicking sheets can be a plus, and a significant contributor to a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d says clinical sleep educator Terry Cralle. We talked to ten sleep doctors and experts to hear their recommendations about the crispest, coolest sheets out there.\n\nBest overall cooling sheets\n\nSOL Organics Percale Organic Sheets Most of the sleep experts agreed that sheets made of breathable natural fibers, like cotton and linen, are the best bet for sweaty sleepers \u2014 and crisp percale cotton was recommended by three of the experts that we asked. \u201cIn general you want a fabric that\u2019s not too tightly woven \u2026 the more breathable the fabric the better,\u201d says Oks. \u201cPercale is naturally very crisp, and it\u2019s a polyester or a cotton blend, which will make it easier and more comfortable for people to sleep.\u201d Cralle also recommended percale sheets, and noted that the matte finish of the sheets \u201cis going to be cooler than sateen,\u201d which is a fabric with a tighter weave. Ben Trapskin, founder of the bedding review site the Sleep Sherpa, says to look for a percale sheet with a single-ply thread count \u2014 meaning that each thread used in the sheets is made of one strand of yarn, rather than two. Trapskin likes this set from SOL Organics, an affordable line of natural sheets. \u201cOrganic sheets aren\u2019t treated with harsh pesticides, which can weaken the cotton fibers,\u201d Trapskin says says. \u201cThese sheets are durable, and sustainable from an environmental and economic perspective.\u201d For their combination of crisp, cool comfort, their organic makeup, and their affordable price point, Trapskin\u2019s choice is our pick for best overall. From $99 at SOL Organics Buy\n\nBest linen cooling sheets\n\nPhoto: james blanco Brooklinen Linen Core Sheet Set Several of the sleep experts we spoke to suggested linen sheets, which, according to Dr. Joshua Tal, a psychologist who specializes in sleep disorders, are very breathable and \u201cpick up cool air.\u201d Oks says that since linen is made of a looser weave than, say, a cotton sheet with a high thread count, it traps less heat. Many of Oks\u2019s sleep apnea patients have been happy with Brooklinen\u2019s linen sheets, as was former Strategist senior writer Lauren Levy, who raved about Brooklinen\u2019s offerings. On their cooling power, she says, \u201cIt won\u2019t feel chilled when you slip into bed, but instead of waking up in a pool of sweat from heat-locking fabrics, you\u2019ll stay fully temperature-controlled throughout the night.\u201d From $249 at Brooklinen Buy\n\nParachute Linen Sheet Set For something at a slightly lower price point, try Parachute\u2019s linen sheets, which come recommended by Trapskin (as does Brooklinen). Parachute\u2019s sheets are also available in more colorways, like this soft blush. Save the darker shades \u2014 like coal and indigo \u2014 for winter because, as Cralle says, \u201cthe color of your sheets can play a role in staying cool while sleeping, with lighter colors reflecting it while dark colors absorb it.\u201d Think of it like choosing a shirt on a hot day \u2014 when it\u2019s warm out, you tend to stay cooler when wearing a lighter color. From $149 at Parachute Buy\n\nBest eucalyptus and Tencel cooling sheets\n\nSheets & Giggles Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Sets Eucalyptus is another naturally cool fiber to look for in a pair of cooling sheets, according to Oks. \u201cEucalyptus generally has some natural temperature regulating properties,\u201d she says. And while Oks notes that the cooling effect of eucalyptus sheets has not been scientifically proven, the fact that it\u2019s a \u201cvery breathable\u201d fiber is one reason why Oks says it feels \u201cso nice on somebody\u2019s skin when they\u2019re sweating at night.\u201d Oks told us that her patients are fans of the brand Sheets and Giggles, which specializes in eucalyptus sheets. (And if you want to try a eucalyptus-based comforter, former Strategist writer Lori Keong wrote that sleeping under Buffy\u2019s was like \u201cbeing cocooned in a cold compress.\u201d) $138 at Sheets & Giggles Buy\n\nSheex Arctic Aire Sheet Set Cralle, Tal, and Trapskin all suggested sheets made of Tencel, a fiber derived from the pulp of eucalyptus trees. Tencel is one of Trapskin\u2019s fabric picks because it\u2019s \u201cbetter at absorbing moisture than most other fibers, making it great for sweaty sleepers. Tencel is also naturally wrinkle-resistant and is a sustainable material.\u201d Tal and Dr. Michael Gelb, a sleep specialist, praised Tencel\u2019s moisture-wicking properties, as well, and Gelb recommended Tencel sheets from Sheex. From $180 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nMolecule Sheets If you want to try Tencel sheets at a lower price point, Trapskin recommends Molecule Sheets. The sheets are made of a Tencel-cotton blend, which, thanks to the cotton, \u201cwill give the sheets a more familiar feel.\u201d Trapskin says Molecule sheets nail the perfect blend \u2014 and the brand makes a cooling mattress, too, if sheets alone aren\u2019t doing the job. $139 at Molecule Buy\n\nBest moisture-wicking sheets\n\nWicked Sheets Original Moisture-Wicking Bed Sheet Set Gelb also recommends nylon-blend sheets, which he says \u201cfeel good and dry quickly.\u201d Lisa J. Pieretti, executive director and co-founder of the International Hyperhidrosis Society, says that her organization loves Wicked Sheets and that they suggest them for many people who struggle with night sweats. Like athletic wear, Wicked sheets are made from a poly-nylon blend to wick moisture away from the skin. The fabric is treated with UV protection to prevent the absorption of heat from the sun, and trace copper elements prohibit the growth of bacteria on the sheets. There are some advantages of choosing synthetics over natural fibers. Dermatologist Jeremy Fenton, of the Schweiger Dermatology Group, acknowledges that cotton and linen are more gentle on the skin with the caveat that \u201cpeople who are going to sweat regardless of the temperature, tend to do a little better with sheets that wick moisture away from the body.\u201d From $69 at Amazon Buy From $69 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
