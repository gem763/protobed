The eccentric costume designer and scientist, however, might want to revise that stance to add \u2018and skirts\u2019 into the equation.\n\nIt\u2019s a suggestion that Regina King would certainly offer to Mode if she could. Watchmen\u2019s lead star, who plays Detective Angela Abar and vigilante alter-ego Sister Night, had her costume\u2019s skirt to thank for her share of bumps and scrapes during filming. It\u2019s all part of the job, King insisted to Metro.co.uk, and comes with the territory of taking part in the show\u2019s acrobatic, brutal fight scenes.\n\n\u2018I took a lot of spills in that skirt \u2013 you get wrapped up in it and you\u2019d go down! \u2013 but I\u2019m happy to say no broken bones,\u2019 King revealed. \u2018Just a few cuts and bruises. You know, the usual battle scars. Our stunt coordinator, who I worked with on The Leftovers, was very much aware of my ability. I also have an amazing stunt double \u2013 she\u2019s a gymnast \u2013 and the combination of our abilities allowed them to choreograph the scenes so it could be a seamless sequence between the two of us.\u2019\n\nRegina King stars as Sister Night in Watchmen (Picture: HBO)\n\nSet in the present day, but in an alternate reality to our own, Watchmen picks up 34 years after the legendary comic book series. Like the source material, vigilantes are part of this reality\u2019s furniture and hide their identities with homemade costumes. Sister Night\u2019s outfit is one of the show\u2019s more elaborate ensembles, and King was unequivocal about how she felt when decked out in the nun-inspired get up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was powerful,\u2019 she stated. \u2018When I put the costume on, I think my body language does change. I just naturally fell into this stride that is clearly different from Angela. I would liken it to what American football players feel when they put on their uniform. There is something about their body language that changes. The first time I was able to be on a football field with NFL players, they\u2019re like Transformers \u2013 they look and move like them and I thought, \u201cWow, look at these warriors.\u201d I had that feeling when putting the costume on.\u2019\n\nKing, who previously worked with showrunner Damon Lindelof on The Leftovers, had no connection to the world of Watchmen prior to being handed the pilot\u2019s script. Even so, the positive experience of collaborating with Lindelof, coupled with the show\u2019s unexpected opening sequence, ensured that she had no reservations about stepping into Angela\u2019s and Sister Night\u2019s shoes.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I had not read the graphic novel or seen the movie, so I had no connection to anything,\u2019 King told us. \u2018My connection was to Damon, and I absolutely loved that experience and his style of running a show and style of writing. He just had me at saying \u201cThis is what I\u2019m doing next.\u201d He delivered the script for me to read and I was blown away by the first five pages. I was like \u201cWhoa, Tulsa Massacre \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing? Okay, alright.\u201d\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Tulsa race riots, described as the single worst incident of racial violence in US history, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of black Oklahoma residents in 1921. The harrowing event, which took place in the Greenwood district known as \u2018Black Wall Street\u2019, makes for shocking viewing as an entry point for the show. King, though, draws parallels between the TV series and the comics in addressing some of the most pressing issues of their times in race and nuclear destruction respectively.\n\nThe Tulsa riots are described as the worst incident of racial violence in US history\n\n(Picture: Everett/REX)\n\n\u2018I had to take a pause, because it\u2019s a story that I\u2019ve always felt should be told,\u2019 King explained. \u2018I feel like so often, when we\u2019re telling the stories of black people in America, it\u2019s always a slave story. There are so many other stories that exist and that is one that my sister and I have always talked about.\n\n\u2018I thought that it was fantastic that Damon was able to use the source material and follow the blueprint, which they did in the original, by finding something present day that has that looming threat over a country. He felt deep inside that this was the only entry point to a story that I could tell. That\u2019s a very hard thing to do, I think, especially dealing with subject matter that\u2019s so sensitive and that has a history that\u2019s wrapped up in a lot of pain, anger, shame, and guilt.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatchmen\u2019s difficult and serious subject matter may have some wondering if filming the series wasn\u2019t fun. For King, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The Oscar and Emmy winner revealed that the cast\u2019s familiarity with each other\u2019s work made it feel like they knew one another before production began \u2013 a factor that helped with her intimate scenes with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who plays Angela\u2019s husband Calvin.\n\nRegina\u2019s familiarity with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II helped with intimate Watchmen scenes (Picture: HBO)\n\n\u2018You come to set with such a tremendous respect for everyone in their art form,\u2019 King went on. \u2018And then it turns out that everyone happens to be really cool, smart, interesting people on top of that.\n\n\u2018You know, not to sound like, \u201cWe all got along\u201d but we did. Yahya and I have such great chemistry. We met each other for the first time when we auditioned but then we didn\u2019t see each other again until we had to act together. The first time we did was that love scene, so you hope that you have chemistry because that is so uncomfortable! There\u2019s nothing sexy about it. You are truly acting and I felt so safe with him \u2013 and him with me \u2013 and we were both like \u201cAlright, we\u2019re about to do this\u201d so we protected each other throughout.\u2019\n\nWatchmen\u2019s iconic status means that there\u2019s always apprehension when discussions about adapting it emerge. Coupled with creator Alan Moore\u2019s well-publicised contempt for other works based on the series, and Lindelof\u2019s worry at doing justice to the source material, and it\u2019s perhaps puzzling why Lost\u2019s co-creator would invite such pressure on himself. After all, Lindelof remains a die hard fan of the comics and cites the graphic novel as the chief influence behind his writing style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the show\u2019s first two episodes being positively received overall by fans and critics alike, King is hopeful that the rest of the series will show how much adulation Lindelof holds for the source material and even entice some viewers to seek out the comics for themselves.\n\n\u2018For Damon, I hope that, if there\u2019s a spike in sales of the graphic novel, then that will probably be the biggest joy for him,\u2019 King said. \u2018That would show that we were successful, and pay homage to a piece of work and art that impacted Damon\u2019s life in such a huge way.\u2019\n\nWatchmen continues this Sunday on HBO and follows a day later on Sky Atlantic.
