The leading 2020 candidates have a variety of plans to shore up the program but they fall short of the elusive goal of complete solvency.\n\n\u201cThe problem with just scrapping the cap or taxing just the wealthy is that it doesn't make the program sustainably solvent beyond 75 years,\u201d says Rep. John Larson (D, CT), a leader in Congress on the issue, noting that \u201cmy take is any solution is important. But here's the bottom line: that's not what Roosevelt intended when the program was initiated.\u201d\n\nA survey of presidential campaigns by Yahoo Finance and the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Funding our Future campaign found a variety of ideas for raising additional revenue with most of the plans focused only on getting revenue through additional taxes on the wealthiest Americans. These plans \u2014 thanks to a range of new benefits and no new taxes on the middle class \u2014 would extend Social Security\u2019s solvency for only a limited time.\n\nAccording to the Social Security Administration itself, \u201csolvency for the Social Security program is defined as the ability of the trust funds at any point in time to pay the full scheduled benefits in the law on a timely basis.\u201d\n\nA variety of approaches\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren brought up her plan on the debate stage on Tuesday night, though she did skirt the full solvency question a bit. \u201cI've put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.\u201d\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren during a commercial break in the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 election. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton More\n\nWarren focused on the additional benefits in her plan instead of the additional taxes needed to pay for it. Warren's full plan would add a \"14.8% Social Security contribution requirement on individual with wages above $250,000\" as well as taxes on capital gains and other \u201cunearned income\" for the wealthiest Americans.\n\n\"Regardless of how much money we spend as a nation on top-notch political consultants, the basic campaign strategy really hasn't really changed since sixth grade,\u201d said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, on Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe candidate stands up at the front of the room, promises to cancel homework and then throws candy.\"\n\nOther candidates plans, like Warren, focused on the benefits instead of the costs. Sen. Bernie Sanders says he \u201cwill expand benefits across-the-board\u201d and that \u201cthe wealthiest Americans in this country must pay their fair share.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in her responses to Yahoo Finance, proposed modest benefit increases and to pay for it she supports \u201csubjecting income above $250,000 to the payroll tax and extending the solvency of Social Security.\u201d\n\nOne plan for solvency through at least 2092\n\nLarson\u2019s plan, the Social Security 2100 Act, would fund the program until the year 2100 by asking for more from every working American. He would gradually phase in an increase in the contribution rate for all workers, \u201cbeginning in 2020, so that by 2043 workers and employers would pay 7.4% instead of 6.2%.\u201d The Social Security payroll tax rate on wages is currently 6.2% for the employer and 6.2% for the employee.\n\nRep.
