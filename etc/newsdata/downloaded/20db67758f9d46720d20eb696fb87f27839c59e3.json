The riding situation didn\u2019t cloud the trainer\u2019s enthusiasm for the $7 favourite, who ran a huge fourth on his Australian debut in the Caulfield Cup.\n\n\u201cHe was the unlucky runner in the Caulfield Cup, and that\u2019s always a good pointer [to the Melbourne Cup],\u201d Hayes said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a light weight, and Glen Boss is very keen on him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy with his fitness levels and I think we\u2019re in a good space.\u201d\n\nHayes said there wasn\u2019t any more emotion attached to this year\u2019s Cup, despite the fact it will be the leading trainer\u2019s last Flemington carnival in some time, having handed control of the Lindsay Park operation to his son Ben, and nephew Tom Dabernig.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family business, and I\u2019ll be just looking forward to watching their journey after me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m only in Hong Kong, not on Mars.\u201d", "description": "The timing of Glen Boss\u2019s appeal against careless riding could impact on the Melbourne Cup in farcical circumstances with the possibility of Joao Moreira being stranded in Australia without a Cup ride.", "authors": ["Leo Schlink", "Russell Gould"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/78b0a8b1b5165d37de4abdcb62e0e59a?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
