President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized federal courts and judges who have blocked his policies, while some Democratic politicians have implied that the court\u2019s conservative majority is motivated mainly by politics instead of interpreting the law.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in a polarized political environment, people tend to see everything in those terms. That\u2019s not how we at the court function and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise,\u201d said Roberts before hundreds in attendance at the Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center in Manhattan.\n\nRoberts in November rebuked Trump after the Republican president called a judge who ruled against his policy barring asylum for certain immigrants an \u201cObama judge.\u201d\n\nIn August, a handful of Democratic senators filed a brief in a firearms case the justices had agreed to hear, suggesting the high court was too influenced by politics. \u201cThe Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it,\u201d the brief said.\n\nThe nine-member court, which begins its next term on Oct. 7, has a 5-4 conservative majority.\n\nRoberts, 64, a conservative appointed by Republican President George W. Bush in 2005, said the justices do not work in a political manner. \u201cA lot of criticism is based on a misperception of the court,\u201d he said.\n\nRoberts pointed out that of the court\u2019s 19 decisions last term that split 5-4, only seven rulings divided along ideological lines.\n\nRoberts has emerged as the court\u2019s ideological centre since the retirement last year of conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes joined the liberal justices in major rulings, including over gay rights and abortion.\n\nLast term, some liberal justices also publicly raised the alarm over the pace at which the conservative majority was overruling precedents, a fear shared by abortion rights advocates and Democratic politicians over whether the court may overrule Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nOn Tuesday, Roberts said the court must respect precedent. There is \u201cno reason to suppose that I and my eight colleagues are any better at discerning the meaning of the constitution than members of the courts that went before us,\u201d he said.\n\nRoberts also drew laughs and cheers from the crowd when, in a nod to liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s growing celebrity, he called her a \u201crock star.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, speaking at a New York synagogue on Tuesday night, lamented the perception that the Supreme Court is becoming politicized and that the justices' decisions are guided primarily by their partisan affiliation.", "authors": ["Andrew Chung", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
