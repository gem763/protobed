Zlochevsky was being investigated by top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, though it is in dispute how serious that investigation was. Trump also suggested that Ukraine should look into issues surrounding the alleged involvement of some Ukrainians in interfering in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBiden boasted in 2018 that, as vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine didn\u2019t fire Shokin, which Trump's allies have said was because of the investigation, but Democrats have said was part of a U.S. and European effort to oust Shokin as ineffective and a hindrance to Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption investigations. Ukraine removed Shokin in 2016.\n\nDOJ also made it clear that Trump never told Barr to contact Ukraine about any investigation of Biden, nor did Barr ever discuss these issues with Ukraine or with Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nTrump gave Barr \u201c full and complete authority to declassify information\u201d related to the origins of the Trump-Russia probe in May after Barr had infuriated Democrats when he said \u201cspying did occur\u201d on the Trump campaign and refused to backtrack. Republicans have alleged that foreign intelligence agencies, like those in Western Europe, may have played a role in eavesdropping on or otherwise monitoring Trump campaign associates in 2016.\n\nDurham\u2019s investigation is separate from the one that was just finished by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The DOJ watchdog investigated allegations of abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the DOJ and FBI, and Horowitz has spoken with Durham, who is handling any criminal referrals from Horowitz\u2019s investigation.", "description": "The Justice Department revealed that U.S. Attorney John Durham, picked by Attorney General William Barr to look into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, is investigating whether Ukraine was involved in any 2016 election efforts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a0ce3cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1302x684+0+41/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcd%2Fee%2F88b20e16410492acd9254be609d0%2Fjohn-durham.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
