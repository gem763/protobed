(Photo: Monica Schipper, Getty Images for Victoria's Secr)\n\nVictoria's Secret just got a little more inclusive.\n\nThe lingerie fashion brand is featuring its first size 14 model, Ali Tate-Cutler, in ads as part of its collaboration with Bluebella, a female-founded, U.K.-based lingerie company.\n\nCutler made the announcement to her Instagram page by posting a photo of herself in Bluebella for Victoria's Secret lingerie along with a few photos of her pictures displayed at a New York City flagship store.\n\n\"I believe I\u2019m the first size 14 on @victoriassecret?,\" Tate captioned the post. \"Regardless I\u2019m pretty stoked to work with a brand I idolized when I was a teen. Great step in the right direction for bodies.\"\n\nCutler also told E! that she was cast to work with Bluebella in London and then was told that her work would be showcased at Victoria's Secret.\n\n\"When I went in today to the VS store for the launch of the collaboration it felt surreal,\" Cutler told the outlet. \"I never expected that I was going to see an image of myself on the wall next to these top super models that I have been looking up to since I was a little girl.\"\n\nMore: Victoria's Secret model details struggle with anorexia, says her hair began to fall out\n\nIt could be said that Victoria's Secret move to showcasing different body types in their stores is a push towards rebranding themselves.\n\nVictoria's Secret has recently been under fire for its lack of inclusivity and body positive messaging. Both Halsey and model Kate Upton have called out the brand for its problematic ways.\n\nUpton said that she was tired of seeing the same body types walking the runways of Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\n\"We're sick of seeing the same body type,\" Upton said in response to a question that the fashion show might be cancelled. \"You have to be body inclusive now, every women needs to be represented otherwise it's a snoozefest.\"\n\nHalsey spoke out after the brand's chief marketing officer Ed Razek, said that he wasn't interested in casting transgender and plus size models for the annual fashion show.\n\n\"As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I have no tolerance for a lack of inclusivity. Especially not one motivated by stereotype,\" the artist wrote to her Instagram after performing for the runway show.\n\nSince then, Razek has retired and Victoria's Secret cast its first openly transgender model, Valentina Sampaio.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2019/10/08/victorias-secret-featured-its-first-plus-sized-model/3906291002/", "description": "Victoria's Secret hired size 14 model Ali Tate-Cutler for their collaboration with Bluebella, another lingerie company.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
