These accounts showcase what it means to be a community across all levels of society, working hard toward the goal of ensuring everyone, no matter what your background is, feels a part of something positive.\"\n\nSEE THEIR POST HERE:\n\nFrom an organisation providing shelter to displaced families to Sal's Shoes finding new feet for preloved children's shoes, their Royal Highnesses have followed a diverse selection of inspiring accounts. And one of them is even based in South Africa.\n\nSurfers Not Street Children was established in 1998 to transform lives through surfing. Based in Durban, South Africa, but with camps out in Mozambique and the UK, Surfers Not Street Children has empowered children throughout the world. Tom Hewitt, the founder of the organisation, was even awarded an MBE for his services helping street children by Queen Elizabeth in 2011.\n\n\"Stoked to be chosen by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,\" the Surfers Not Street Children Instagram account shared, before revealing His Royal Highness personally made a stop to the organisation.\n\n\"Our supporters may remember when His Royal Highness Prince Harry visited us at Surfers Not Street Children a while back. So much fun!\" they commented.\n\n\"The kids were frothing. So rad. Hopefully, we will one day welcome Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex in South Africa or Mozambique.\"", "description": "Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan have announced their new charities to follow through the month of October.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9425/09e54561b4874fd7942d7548b3ae8b5d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
