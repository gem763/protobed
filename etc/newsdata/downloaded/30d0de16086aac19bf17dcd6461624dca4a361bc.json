Why run anywhere just to run back to the beginning, sweaty, breathless, and heart pounding? That dismissive attitude was held decades ago, but many joggers ignored it and kept moving. Researchers recently got to wondering how the health of multi-decade joggers\u2014and other long-term exercisers\u2014compared with that of the less active.\n\nThe Cardio Health of a Healthy Forty Year-old\n\nI\u2019ll fast forward to the astonishing findings.\n\nLong-term exercisers now in their 70s have been exercising regularly for decades. They had the heart, lung, and muscle fitness of healthy people at least 30 years younger than their age.\n\nIt\u2019s long been a given that exercise is generally good for general overall health. Now we have substantiating data\u2014in detail.[i]\n\nIt was back in the 1970s that those jogging and aerobics \u201cweirdos\u201d started what became a lifelong habit\u2014and a sizable cohort of them never stopped. So today\u2019s septuagenarians have been exercising regularly for the past 50 years.\n\nThe Performance Laboratory at Indiana\u2019s Ball State University is headed by exercise physiologist Scott Trappe. He and his team are among the first to dive into this data pool, which had never even existed until now.\n\nSays Trappe, \u201cWe were interested in basically two questions: One, what was their cardiovascular health? And two, what was their skeletal muscle health?\u201d\n\nTrappe divided 70 healthy participants into three groups.\n\nThose in the lifelong exercise group were on average 75 years old and primarily kept their heart rates up through running and cycling. They participated in structured exercise 4 to 6 days a week, for a total of about 7 hours a week. The second group was also of individuals who were on average, 75 years old. They didn\u2019t have structured exercise regimens, just an occasional walk or round of golf. The third group? Young exercisers, 25 years old on average, who worked out with the same frequency and length of time as the long-term exercisers.\n\nAll participants were assessed in Ball State\u2019s Human Performance Laboratory.\n\nThe heart of the findings\n\nThe participants\u2019 cardiovascular health was measured by having them cycle on an indoor bike to determine VO2 max, also known as maximal oxygen uptake. This measures the maximum amount of oxygen a person can take in and use during intense exercise, and is an indicator of lung capacity and aerobic fitness.\n\nAs the cycling test became increasingly difficult, cyclers breathed into a mouthpiece that measured oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.\n\nThe results?\n\nWell, one result confirmed what already made intuitive sense.\n\nThe people who exercised regularly year after year were in better overall health than their sedentary counterparts.\n\nBut the specifics? Wow. Another result knocked it out of the park. \u201cThese 75-year-olds,\u201d says Trappe, \u201cmen and women\u2014have similar cardiovascular health to a 40- to 45-year-old.\u201d\n\nThe muscle in the findings\n\nTo determine the aerobic profile of the participants\u2019 muscles, the study took a small tissue sample for a biopsy Lab researchers examined the micro-vessels, or capillaries, that allow blood to flow through the muscle itself, bringing it fresh oxygen.\n\nThey also looked for specific enzymes that provide fuel to the working muscle and help break down carbohydrates and fats.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nLooking at the participants from this different angle, they again found a striking, positive result: the longtime exercisers had the muscle and circulatory health of people 30 years younger than their age.\n\nDoes this mean we can exercise ageing away?\n\nIt surely sounds like a major step in that direction. Which would be huge news, as the average adult\u2019s ability to process oxygen declines by about 10 percent per decade after age 30. With that loss, of course, comes decline in virtually all of our major systems. Less oxygen, after all, means less function\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a slow decay over time that\u2019s probably not so noticeable in your 30s or 40s,\u201d says Trappe.\n\nBut as years go on, you may have noticed that you\u2019re breathing hard doing things you once cruised through, or you have to stop to catch your breath, or tire far more easily\u2014all of which discourage you from exercise, the best remedy for all of these issues.\n\nSo the answer is yes, if regular, long-term exercise can slow or halt that decade-by-decade decline for some people, it\u2019s as if ageing really gets stopped in its tracks.\n\nDon\u2019t forget: age-related reductions in cardiovascular and lung capacity are associated with higher risk of many chronic diseases and mortality. Maintaining a strong heart and lung system has been shown to decrease these health risks.\n\nHow much exercise do you need?\n\nDavid Costill, 82, professor emeritus of exercise science at Ball State University is an exercise physiologist. He says he\u2019s spent about 60 years actively exercising, and ran marathons for about 20 years until his knees started to bother him. Then he hit the pool, and has been swimming for the last 35 years.\n\nCostill says he can do a lot more physically than his agemates. \u201cIf I\u2019m out with a group of my peers, guys who are near 80, and we\u2019re going someplace, it seems to me they\u2019re all walking at half speed.\u201d\n\nSo is 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day is the key to a healthy life?\n\nI\u2019m not one to make blanket statements, so my answer, \u201cYes,\u201d comes with important caveats. \u201cIf you want to do 30 to 45 minutes of walking a day,\u201d says Trappe, the amount of health benefit you are going to get is going to be significant and substantial.\u201d\n\nHit the ground gently\n\nI wholeheartedly agree, but advise that it\u2019s all relative, all about your start point. If you\u2019re sedentary, or relatively so, 30 to 45 minutes a day is a long leap. You don\u2019t want to push yourself that hard. If it\u2019s even possible for you, it could easily do more harm than good, in the form of strains, sprains, pulled muscles, falls, and the like.\n\nWhat you want is a gradually increasing number of reasonable challenges to your body. So going from sedentary to 15 minutes of walking a day might be a good start, but if that\u2019s a stretch, even 10 minutes is wonderful.\n\nContinue adding time and degree of challenge when your 10 to 15 minutes a day feels easy. Here\u2019s a handy metric to tell if you\u2019re working hard enough to really get your heart going: if you can\u2019t talk while you exercise, you\u2019re pushing yourself too hard, but if you can sing, you\u2019re taking it too easy.\n\nSo you don\u2019t have to run marathons or compete in cycling or speed swimming. You won\u2019t get the same results as those heavy lifters, but I guarantee you\u2019ll start feeling better within days\u2014not least because you have every reason to congratulate yourself for taking charge of your health.\n\n[i] J Appl Physiol (1985). 2018 Nov 1;125(5):1636-1645. doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00174.2018.
