The Turkish army and its Syrian rebel allies drove Kurdish forces from Afrin in 2018.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Syria's state-run SANA news agency reported Damascus, which is backed militarily by Russia and Iran, was sending troops to the country's north to \"confront the Turkish aggression\". It did not give further details.\n\n191013083950643\n\nThe return of Syrian government forces to the region - where Syrian Kurds have built an autonomous administration over the course of the country's eight-year-war - could further cement Assad's hold over the country, and raise the risk of a clash between Syria and Turkey.\n\nThe developments reflected the rapidly growing chaos that has unfolded in the week since US President Donald Trump ordered US forces in the region to step aside, clearing the way for the Turkish attack on the Kurdish fighters it considers \"terrorists\".\n\nTrump's decision has been broadly condemned at home and abroad by critics who accuse him of betraying the Kurds, who fought alongside the US to help defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group in Syria.\n\n'Untenable'\n\nMark Esper, US defence secretary, told US broadcaster CBS' \"Face the Nation\" programme that up to 1,000 US troops would be withdrawn from northern Syria because of the increasing danger posed by the fighting.\n\n\"We have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it's a very untenable situation,\" he said in the interview that aired on Sunday.\n\nHe added that Washington had learned \"in the last 24 hours\" that Turkey \"likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned and to the west\".\n\nTurkey launched its military offensive on Wednesday, pledging to clear the area of \"terrorist\" elements and create a so-called \"safe zone\" to resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts on its soil.\n\nThe \"safe zone\" Turkey had proposed was to span a stretch of territory 120 km wide and 30km deep inside Syria. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted on Sunday the area may be wider, running between the towns of al-Hassakeh and Kobane, a stretch of 440km.\n\nErdogan has said Turkey 'will not stop' the offensive 'no matter what anyone says' [Presidential Press Office handout via Reuters]\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Akcakale on the Turkey-Syria border, said the withdrawal of US forces from northern Syria had put \"the whole area up for grabs\".\n\n\"There's more than one player in the Syrian conflict who wants to control this territory, which has oil and is the bread basket of Syria,\" she said. The pact between the Kurds and Assad's government indicates the end to the Kurdish-led administration's rule in Syria, Khodr added.\n\n\"It\u2019s unlikely that the Damascus government is going to allow them to continue governing this whole region by themselves,\" she said, adding the SDF had \"little leverage\" over Assad's government.\n\nISIL prison break\n\nTurkey's official Anadolu news agency, meanwhile, said Turkey-backed Syrian forces have advanced into the center of a Syrian border town, Tel Abyad, on the fifth day of Turkey's offensive. Turkey's Defense Ministry tweeted that its forces had taken control of the main highway running between al-Hassakeh and Ain Issa, the administrative center of the Kurdish-held areas.\n\nCasualties mounted. On Sunday, at least nine people, including five civilians, were killed in Turkish airstrikes on a convoy in Ras al-Ain, according to Syrian Kurdish officials and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\n191013111641158\n\nImages of the attack showed bodies and severed limbs strewn in the street. A journalist was among those killed.\n\nThe fighting has raised fears that some of the thousands of suspected ISIL fighters held by the SDF will escape or be released in the chaos, allowing the battered group to make a comeback.\n\nOn Sunday, heavy fighting reached a displaced-persons camp in Ain Issa, some 35km south of the border, that is home to some 12,000 people, including around 1,000 wives and widows of suspected ISIL fighters and their children, held in a special detention area.\n\nJelal Ayaf, a senior official at the camp, told local media that 859 people successfully escaped from the section of the facility housing foreign nationals.\n\nAyaf also warned that \"sleeper cells\" had emerged from inside another part of the facility and carried out attacks, describing the situation as \"very volatile\". Al Jazeera could not verify the claims.\n\nErdogan, for his part, called the reports \"disinformation\" aimed at provoking the US and other western countries, according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency.", "description": "In a major shift in alliance, Kurdish forces announce deal with Damascus on Syrian troop deployment near Turkey border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/c4a470721d0b489aabe8a6e05a014804_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
