Biden, the current front-runner in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary.\n\nThe White House unfroze the money as it became clear a number of Republican lawmakers were willing to vote for its release.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican and Chairman of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, said in a statement the money \u201cwill provide vital assistance to help the Ukrainian military continue on their path of increasing their ability to defend their homeland against any threat.\u201d\n\nJust hours before reports were confirmed that the financial assistance had been approved, the Senate Appropriations Committee considered an amendment to be included in the defense appropriations bill that would have authorized the additional support.\n\n\u201cThere is near panic in Ukraine today\u201d over whether the U.S. will release the funds, said Sen. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n\u201cThey are desperate for a bipartisan signal from the U.S. that we remain with them.\u201d\n\nExperts say that withholding aide could have been detrimental to U.S.-Ukraine relations under the country\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who faces pressure to deal with Russian aggression and intervention in Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs.\n\n\u201cThe withholding of aid could have sent a message of U.S. indifference to Kremlin aggression, a dangerous message,\u201d John E. Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said in an email from Kyiv.\n\nRussia in 2014 annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and is widely accused of backing separatist groups in eastern Ukraine who have seized parts of the country and sparked a civil war that the U.N. says has already resulted in more than 13,000 deaths, including thousands of civilians.\n\nAfter Congress approved the $250 million military aid package, which included lethal weapons such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, the White House last month unexpectedly ordered Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and recently ousted National Security Adviser John R. Bolton to review the program. The Pentagon subsequently determined the package was in the U.S. national interest.\n\nMr. Herbst said Thursday\u2019s funding release \u201cfixes a short-sighted and even dangerous policy that, over time, might have encouraged Moscow to escalate.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Senate appropriators clashed Thursday over whether to allow funding from the defense budget to go toward construction projects on the Mexican border, jeopardizing the congressional timetable to pass a massive $693 billion defense budget.\n\nFunding for President Trump\u2019s controversial border wall and immigration policies has proved to be a major sticking point in budget negotiations as Congress races against the clock to pass the budget by the end of this month to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDemocrats have stood firm in their fight against diverting $6.1 billion in Pentagon money to construct what they call a \u201cvanity wall\u201d at the southern border, while Republicans echoed White House arguments that the money is vital to national security.\n\n\u201cWe need every single penny for defense to make certain that we don\u2019t lose a war for lack of the best technology on earth,\u201d Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said in opposing the transfer.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
