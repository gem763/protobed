Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump has a consistent record of contempt for human life. He has endorsed violence against journalists, executions for nonlethal offenses, the use of poison gas, and the deliberate targeting of family members of suspected terrorists. Now Trump is offering a new argument for atrocities: Death and suffering in war are good for peace.\n\nOn Oct. 6, after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump announced that he was withdrawing American troops from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey. This cleared the way for a Turkish invasion of land previously held by the Kurds\u2014who, until Trump\u2019s betrayal, were American allies in Syria. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the invasion has killed scores of civilians and hundreds of combatants. It has produced a wave of arson, looting, kidnapping, and roadside executions. It has driven 300,000 people from their homes.\n\nTrump admits that he could have prevented this carnage. Instead, he\u2019s welcoming it.\n\nOn Oct. 17, the United States announced an agreement to halt the invasion. The agreement essentially accepted Turkish control of the seized territory. But Trump said the deal\u2014really, a surrender\u2014couldn\u2019t have been accomplished without the violence he had unleashed. \u201cWithout that gunfire going back and forth, without those rockets going in both directions, without other countries moving in and potentially moving in and creating virtually a world war\u2014without all of that happening, you would\u2019ve never been able to make this deal,\u201d he declared.\n\nTrump credited his fake breakthrough not just to the violence but to the bloodshed it inflicted. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t go through two and a half days of hell, I don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said of the Kurds and Turks. On Wednesday, he boasted, \u201cThe pain and suffering of the three-day fight that occurred was directly responsible for our ability to make an agreement with Turkey and the Kurds that could never have been made without this short-term outburst.\u201d\n\nThe president claimed that this pain was part of a brilliant strategy.\n\nThe president claimed that this pain was part of a brilliant strategy. \u201cIt was unconventional, what I did,\u201d he told the audience at a political rally in Dallas on Oct. 17. He explained that in anticipation of the invasion, \u201cI said, \u2018They\u2019re going to have to fight a little while.\u2019 Sometimes you have to let \u2019em fight. \u2026 Like two kids in a lot, you got to let \u2019em fight, and then you pull \u2019em apart.\u201d Four days later, in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity, Trump used the same metaphor. Three times, he described this policy as \u201ctough love.\u201d\n\nThe Turks didn\u2019t need much persuasion to accept a deal that gave them control of Kurdish land. But the Kurds needed persuasion to flee. That\u2019s what Trump accomplished by getting out of Erdogan\u2019s way. \u201cThe Kurds are tending to leave, and that\u2019s good,\u201d Trump said on Oct. 12. On Monday, he boasted that if the \u201cshooting didn\u2019t start \u2026 I don\u2019t think the Kurds would have moved.\u201d On Thursday, he tweeted that they should keep running: \u201cPerhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!\u201d\n\nSupporters of the Kurds point out that they fought bravely with us against ISIS, that they\u2019ve helped us by guarding captured ISIS fighters, and that Trump is repaying their loyalty by inviting Turkey to kill them. But Trump says the Kurds deserve what they\u2019re getting. Five times since the invasion began, he scoffed that they\u2019re \u201cno angels.\u201d He accused them of releasing ISIS prisoners \u201cjust for effect,\u201d to embarrass and scare the United States. The Turks had every right to invade Kurdish land along their border, said Trump: \u201cThey had to have it cleaned out.\u201d\n\nWhat about all the people driven from their homes? \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of sand,\u201d the president shrugged, referring to Syria and the countries fighting over it. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d The only thing Trump cares about is what\u2019s under the ground: oil. On Monday, he recalled that in the Iraq war, \u201cI always said, If you\u2019re going in, keep the oil. Same thing here: Keep the oil. We want to keep the oil.\u201d He proposed a \u201ccash flow\u201d deal between the Kurds and an American oil conglomerate of his choosing. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly.\u201d On Friday, he lied, \u201cWe just did a great thing in Syria. \u2026 We took over oil. A lot of great things are happening.\u201d\n\nWhile celebrating the Kurds\u2019 pain and proposing to exploit them financially, Trump also suggested that European countries deserved whatever terrorism they might suffer at the hands of ISIS prisoners liberated by the invasion. He said he had given France, Germany, and other countries many chances to accept these prisoners. At the Values Voter Summit on Oct. 12, the president joked that he had threatened to sic ISIS terrorists on Europe. He said that he had told European leaders in phone calls, \u201cYou have to take them back, or I\u2019m going to let them go right on your damn border.\u201d The audience of professed moralists laughed. But Trump\u2019s indifference was no joke. When reporters warned of terrorism by ISIS escapees, he said it wasn\u2019t his problem. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s where they want to go.\u201d\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first president to withdraw troops in the face of a threat. He isn\u2019t the first to rationalize civilian deaths, tolerate ethnic cleansing, or sit on his hands as one country pummeled another. But he\u2019s the only president in modern history to say that the pain and suffering of war are good. He defends theft, murder, terror, and ethnic cleansing not just as tragic consequences but as instruments of foreign policy. The danger to America under Trump isn\u2019t that the bad guys won\u2019t fear us anymore. It\u2019s that we\u2019ll be the bad guys.", "description": "Death is good.", "authors": ["William Saletan"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/ee7d64fd-cd2c-41b2-9e9a-026b2142c05c.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
