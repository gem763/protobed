But that hasn\u2019t stopped it being messy, unsatisfying and dramatically redundant: a laborious Ted-talking satire delivered with the same air of smirking self-satisfaction that I found unbearable in Adam McKay\u2019s The Big Short. That, too, was about financial wrongdoing with wide ramifications, based on a smart nonfiction bestseller.\n\nSoderbergh on Hollywood: 'It's not crooked \u2013 it's the most transparent industry going' Read more\n\nThis film is directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Scott Z Burns, inspired by the 2017 book Secrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers by the Pulitzer-winning journalist Jake Bernstein. It creates a fictional scenario spun off from the very real scandal revealed by the Panama Papers data dump \u2013 a world of unaccountable offshore companies that launder dodgy cash and allow the super-rich to avoid tax.\n\nMeryl Streep phones in her performance as Ellen, a retired woman whose husband has been killed in a freak accident, and who finds she is unable to sue the people guilty of negligence because their re-insurers are concealed behind a shell company in Nevis. So she resolves to track down the bad guys. The movie is narrated by a grinning pair of dirty rotten scoundrels: Ram\u00f3n Fonseca (Antonio Banderas) and J\u00fcrgen Mossack (Gary Oldman), the real-life legal rogues who unwillingly made the headlines with their fabulously lucrative business manufacturing tens of thousands of iffy shell companies all over the world from their Panamanian base.\n\nThe plot features many different imaginary victims and villains, never staying with any of them long enough for us to care, though one chapter \u2013 about a crooked African businessman played by Nonso Anozie \u2013 goes on for a bafflingly long time without revealing why his story deserves any more space than anyone else\u2019s. Streep\u2019s story does not provide a central dramatic thread but simply disappears into the film\u2019s patchwork quilt of tales before triumphantly emerging with an odd, dramatically stylised imposture that is easily seen through. A disappointment.", "description": "The Panama Papers story arrives on the big screen as a star-studded romp full of smarm and short of focus", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/365d4f3d4e15abb162ffbf025bab241a4bc695fc/1033_564_1492_895/master/1492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db690a9b68aba7ae86410facb038eed1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
