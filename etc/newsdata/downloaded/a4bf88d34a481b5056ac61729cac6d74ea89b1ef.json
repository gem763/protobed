He declined.", "language": "en", "text": "Mandel Ngan/Getty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears in front of the House Committee on Financial Services on October 23.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced a Congressional committee hearing on Wednesday, where lawmakers asked him about everything from user data scandals to housing discrimination.\n\nOne line of questioning targeted Facebook\u2019s content moderation practices, which rely on contracted workers who have complained of PTSD and other psychological effects of policing the most horrific content uploaded by users: Murders, suicides, hate speech, and more.\n\nWhen asked if he would personally spend an hour each day moderating the worst offenders, Zuckerberg demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it would best serve our community for me to spend that much time on that, but I spend a lot of time looking at this content,\u201d he said.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a billionaire several times over thanks to his work at Facebook.\n\nThe tens of thousands of contractors that Facebook employs through a third-party service are not billionaires, and many are making as little as $US30,000 per year to police the site for the prohibited, and typically horrific, content that gets uploaded every minute.\n\nThat much was revealed in a report from The Verge earlier this year, which highlighted the poor working conditions of those contractors as they removed child pornography, gruesome deaths, and other such content uploaded by users to Facebook.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got about 15,000 contractors watching murders, stabbings, suicides, other gruesome, disgusting videos, for content moderation Correct?\u201d Rep. Katie Porter asked Zuckerberg on Wednesday during a Congressional hearing. \u201cYes, that is correct,\u201d he answered.\n\nYouTube Congresswoman Katie Porter.\n\nIn addition to the difficult job they have, these moderators are said to suffer from difficult working conditions.\n\n\u201cAccording to one report I have, and this is straight out of an episode of \u2018Black Mirror,\u2019 these workers get nine minutes of supervised wellness time per day,\u201d Rep. Katie Porter said to Zuckerberg on Wednesday. \u201cThat means nine minutes to cry in the stairwell while someone watches them.\u201d\n\nBefore Zuckerberg could push back, Porter asked, \u201cWould you be willing to commit to spending one hour per day for the next year watching these videos and acting as a content monitor, and only accessing the same benefits available to your workers?\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Zuckerberg calls reports of Facebook content moderators suffering PTSD after watching videos of people dying \u2018a little overdramatic\u2019\n\n\n\nWithout answering the question, Zuckerberg pointed to the \u201cgood benefits\u201d all content moderators employed by Facebook have. But Porter cut him off.\n\n\u201cMr. Zuckerberg I\u2019m looking for a yes or a no. Would you be willing to act as a content monitor? To have that life experience?,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that it would best serve our community for me to spend that much time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I spend a lot of time looking at this content.\u201d Porter cut him off once again. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re not qualified to be a content moderator?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo Congresswoman, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying,\u201d he responded. The Congresswoman had one more response: \u201cOK then you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not willing to do it.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
