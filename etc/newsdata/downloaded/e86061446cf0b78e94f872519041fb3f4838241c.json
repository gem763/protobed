(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nIntegrity\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\n\n\u2018Integrity lowers the price of capital.\u201d\n\nAn extremely successful investor once told me that. The context at the time was Donald Trump\u2019s impending takeover of the GOP. This person meant it as an investment rule, an insight into Trump, and a life lesson.\n\nThe investment-rule part is easy. Say you run a bank. Two people each want a loan. The first person is a pillar of the community. You\u2019ve worked with him a dozen times before and he\u2019s always been a straight shooter, even when he legally didn\u2019t have to be. The times he had trouble making a payment, he called you well in advance, explained the situation honestly, and went to extraordinary lengths to honor his commitments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know the second applicant only by reputation. He\u2019s known around town as sharp but also a bit shady. He\u2019s successful, but he\u2019s weaseled out of commitments. He\u2019s the kind of guy who says the check\u2019s in the mail when it isn\u2019t and cuts corners when he can. He\u2019s left a trail of partners holding the bag because, hell, \u201cIt\u2019s just business.\u201d\n\nAll else being equal, whom are you more inclined to lend money or charge a lower interest rate? The man with integrity, because integrity mitigates risk. And risk is what determines the cost of capital. It\u2019s why government-backed bonds pay a lower interest rate than high-risk \u201cjunk\u201d bonds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis same principle applies to hiring and promoting people. Whether babysitters or top executives, employees who\u2019ve showed up, worked hard, and earned trust are a less risky bet. It\u2019s not just boilerplate when employers talk about \u201cinvesting\u201d in their workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs my friend explained, there was a reason Trump had so much difficulty raising money from traditional sources. He had a record of using bankruptcy laws to get out of debts. He broke promises as a business strategy. He left lenders and contractors alike holding the bag. After all, \u201cIt\u2019s just business.\u201d\n\nWhich brings me to the life lesson. This same basic principle is a good one in all the parts of life that can\u2019t easily or obviously be reduced to financial transactions. If you treat others fairly, honor commitments, and do kindnesses \u2014 call them favors \u2014 when you can, it\u2019s more likely that people will treat you the same way. One good turn deserves another.\n\nThis sort of reciprocity is what makes friendships and communities healthy, because it increases what social scientists call \u201csocial trust\u201d and \u201csocial capital.\u201d Healthy communities are places where people show up for the potluck dinners and donate to the food drives, even when they may not want to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous to apply local or personal principles to the national. Such thinking is at the core of ideologies like socialism and nationalism, which hold that countries should behave like a family or small group of neighbors. It\u2019s even worse when you try to extrapolate to the whole planet. The rules of the international order are not the same as the rules of the nation, never mind the family.\n\nStill, there\u2019s some relevance. Oscar Wilde famously said that a cynic is someone who knows the price of everything but the value of nothing. President Trump talks a lot about the price of our relationships and commitments around the world. (They\u2019re playing us for suckers!) He\u2019s often wrong on the facts, though sometimes he has a point. But he never talks about, or even acknowledges, the value of these things.\n\nIn Hong Kong, protesters risk death or prison by waving American flags on the assumption that America actually meant it when we said we were friends to those seeking freedom. Syrian Kurds fought by our side in the battle against ISIS at least in part because they took American integrity seriously. Our allies have sent troops to fight in our battles even when it wasn\u2019t in their narrow self-interest to do so. For instance, Australia hasn\u2019t fought by our side in every major military engagement since World War I out of a philosophy of \u201cAustralia First.\u201d The Australians did it because they value our friendship and believe that national honor \u2014 ours and theirs \u2014 requires more than a mere cost\u2013benefit analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump heaps praise on nations that reject our values while disparaging those that share them. His definition of national honor, or \u201cgreatness,\u201d puts no value in our commitments \u2014 to other nations or to American ideals \u2014 while putting a price on everything. Promises are just things you say to maximize profit. After all, it\u2019s just business, and integrity\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "Trump puts no value in our commitments, only a price on everything.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
