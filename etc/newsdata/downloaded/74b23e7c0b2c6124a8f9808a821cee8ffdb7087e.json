That\u2019s precisely what Kylie Jenner did while giving a filmed tour of her Kylie\u2019s Cosmetic office, and that impulse lead to the most delightful piece of video content we\u2019ve seen all week. At one point during the video, Kylie tells the camera that she\u2019s going to wake up her daughter, Stormi, and quietly saunters into her room. Once inside, she flips on the light and launches into the most melodious, glorious three line aria we\u2019ve ever heard: \u201cRise and Shine.\u201d Fin.\n\ni can\u2019t stop watching this i\u2019m dying pic.twitter.com/J916bNRMIa \u2014 \u02da\u2727benjamjn (@kylie_gender) October 14, 2019\n\nThe moment in of itself is pure in nature: just a mother singing to her new born babe, telling her it\u2019s time to wake and greet the day! However the simplicity of the circumstances belies the intricacy of her song which is where we, the viewer, derive our joy. The addition of an \u201ch\u201d before the word \u201crise,\u201d the breathiness of her tone, the subtle lilt to end of the word \u201cshine\u201d - whether she knows it or not, Kylie is making complicated melodic choices, people! Beyond Kylie\u2019s innate musicality, the emptiness of Stormi\u2019s room, the earnestness in her delivery, and the fact that Stormi is clearly awake and sitting upright when Kylie starts singing combines to make the entire video a work of modern art.\n\nThe artistry of Kylie\u2019s song is not lost to the internet. \u201cRise and Shine\u201d has already been made into a ringtone, written out phonetically, and covered by princess Ari herself, and we are sure there are plenty more to come.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised by Kylie\u2019s songwriting skills; it\u2019s no secret that she loves music! Kylie recently broke things off with rapper Travis Scott and was spotted hanging around ex-boyfriend Tyga\u2019s recording studio. Also, who could forget her friendship with singer Pia Mia, who quite boldly sang an acoustic version of \u201cHold On We\u2019re Going Home\u201d for Kanye and Drake around the Kardashian dinner table once upon a time? Sorry, Pia, but it\u2019s clearly Kylie\u2019s time to \u201crise and shine.\u201d Someone get this girl on the next season of The Masked Singer ASAP.", "description": "Kylie Jenner sings the words \u2018rise and shine\u2019 to her daughter, Stormi, while giving a filmed tour of Kylie\u2019s Cosmetic office.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/16-Kylie-Jenner.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
