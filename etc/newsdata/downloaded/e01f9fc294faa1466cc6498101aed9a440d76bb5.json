I thought I could not get more excited about this game. I was wrong. Flashy animated intros from Studio Trigger, the folks behind Kill La Kill, have that effect. Every game should have one.\n\nFounded by former Gainax employees in 2011, Studio Trigger has mastered the art of balancing motion and emotion. When characters in their animation are angry, they move angry. When they are filled with joy, so are their movements. Their work never fails to get me excited about whatever it\u2019s attached to. Case in point, the Indivisible intro.\n\nIt\u2019s so good. I want to join Ajna and her party. I want to kick those little ball-teeth creatures in the face. Who are all those people towards the end? I want to meet them.\n\nThe Indivisible intro runs two minutes and 20 seconds, which is plenty of time for any animator to get the crowd going. What can Studio Trigger do with 30 seconds?\n\nThat\u2019s the opening for Shantae and the Seven Sirens, the fifth game in Wayforward\u2019s long-running action platformer series. It\u2019s frantic and catchy, gives all the characters a little screen time, and then sends us packing to Apple Arcade, where the first chapter of the game is now available to play.\n\nFrom short and sweet intros to original works like Promare, the studio\u2019s first full-length feature, Trigger hasn\u2019t failed to dazzle me yet. I know it sounds like a lot of work, but I wouldn\u2019t mind every single game I play ever again opening with some Studio Trigger animation. Pokemon. Call of Duty. Tetris. All of them.", "description": "Today Skullgirls studio Lab Zero Games debuted the animated opening to Indivisible, the eagerly anticipated action role-playing game.
