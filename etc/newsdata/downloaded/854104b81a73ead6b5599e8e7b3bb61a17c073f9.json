John Cornyn John Cornyn The 13 Republicans needed to pass gun-control legislation The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Biden steadies in third debate as top tier remains the same Congress set to ignore Trump's wall request in stopgap measure MORE (R-Texas) described the negotiations as \u201cpretty fragile.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they break down we\u2019re looking at potentially a long-term CR,\u201d he said, referring to a continuing resolution.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellO'Rourke responds to Buttigieg's gun criticism: 'That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place' Cicilline on Trump investigations versus legislation: 'We have to do both' The 13 Republicans needed to pass gun-control legislation MORE (R-Ky.), meanwhile, warned against getting \u201cbogged down in too many foxholes\u201d and disclosed that he\u2019d turned to a higher power to help resolve the fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m praying for Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member [Patrick] Leahy that the curtains will part here and we\u2019ll figure a way to move forward,\u201d said McConnell, who is also a member of the Appropriations Committee.\n\nBut a quick resolution is nowhere in sight with senators at a stalemate over major provisions, including the top-line spending figures for each of the bills, known as 302b\u2019s.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee passed the top-line figures, a mammoth fiscal year 2020 defense bill and an energy and water funding bill on Thursday \u2014 marking the first bills cleared by the panel despite having less than two weeks until the end of the fiscal year.\n\nBut neither the 302b\u2019s or the defense bill currently have the votes to pass the Senate, where they would need the support of at least seven Democrats if every Republican voted for them.\n\nDemocrats are taking issue with the top-line figures, which break down how much money each bill will get, because they believe Republicans are padding extra money toward the Homeland Security bill. And they balked at supporting the Pentagon spending bill after Republicans rejected an amendment that would have prevented Trump from shifting money in the bill toward the border wall without congressional sign off.\n\nSen.

Democrats previously blocked the defense spending bill in 2016 as part of an effort to force a budget deal; McConnell, who is currently up for reelection, used the votes to paint Democrats as undermining national security.\n\nSpokesmen for McConnell didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about whether the GOP leader would bring up the defense bill. But they are expected to announce guidance for floor consideration of the spending bills this week, suggesting the GOP leader does still intend to bring some legislation to the floor.\n\nDemocrats are making it clear they won\u2019t provide Republicans with the votes unless they sit down and renegotiate the spending legislation.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyBolton exit provokes questions about Trump shift on Iran Trump, lawmakers consider app that would conduct background checks: report Congress set to ignore Trump's wall request in stopgap measure MORE (D-Conn.) said he thought Republicans \u201cpulled the rug out from under us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey've got to realize the mistake they made. They've made a tactical error, and it won't be the first time that a majority party has had to correct itself,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if any spending bills could pass on the floor, he added, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had every member of the Democratic caucus voting no\u201d in committee, he said. \u201cI think we've got to renegotiate the allocations, and if we negotiate the allocations we can move forward.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerSinema says she would back Kennedy in race against Markey Democrats threaten to withhold defense votes over wall Pelosi: 'People are dying' because McConnell won't bring up gun legislation MORE (D-N.Y.) characterized efforts to fund the government as being at a \u201ccrossroads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one wants to resort to a continuing resolution or, God forbid, another Republican, President Trump Donald John TrumpHarris bashes Kavanaugh's 'sham' nomination process, calls for his impeachment after sexual misconduct allegation Celebrating 'Hispanic Heritage Month' in the Age of Trump Let's not play Charlie Brown to Iran's Lucy MORE inspired, government shutdown. But it takes two to tango. My Republican colleagues must know that what happens in the next few days and weeks will determine whether we can proceed with a bipartisan appropriations process this fall or not,\u201d he said from the Senate floor late last week.\n\nThe path forward doesn\u2019t get easier for lawmakers.\n\nWith the full year funding bills stuck in limbo, Congress will need to pass a short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, by the end of the month. The House is expected to vote on a bill this week that would fund the government until Nov. 21.\n\nAnd behemoth funding fights are still awaiting senators, who have already punted both the Health and Human Services, Labor and Education bill and funding for the State Department over concerns that Democrats would try to insert abortion-related language into the bills.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee still has to take up a funding bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs and military construction. The bill will be controversial because Republicans are expected to include money to replace the $3.6 billion in military construction funding that Trump redirected to the border wall.\n\nAnd funding for the Department of Homeland Security is considered so controversial that Republican senators say the aren\u2019t sure that they will even bring the bill up.\n\nShelby characterized the spending talks as in \u201cround one.\u201d But asked if he could move DHS in his committee, Shelby demurred.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s challenging,\u201d he said, before throwing his arms up as he got in an elevator. \u201cSooner or later we\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d", "description": "Senate government funding talks are off to a rough start with 10 working days to go until the shutdown deadline.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/funding_091319hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
