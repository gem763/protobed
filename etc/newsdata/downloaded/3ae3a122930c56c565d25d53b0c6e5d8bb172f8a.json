No one does\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "She cradles her newborn as she breastfeeds her, a tender moment that should bring her nothing but contentment and pride. Instead Elina Maseko\u2019s eyes are brimming with tears. She can\u2019t stop thinking about how close she came to losing her baby when she gave birth to her in the street \u2013 right outside the gates of a clinic in Pretoria.\n\nElina (47) also can\u2019t forget how thenurses allegedly turned her away that Sunday night, refusing to admit her even though she was in full labour. The indignity and humiliation of giving birth in public \u2013 in full view of passers-by \u2013 and the terror of thinking she would lose her child, will be with her forever, she tells us when we visit mom and baby in their Mamelodi East home.\n\n\u201cThis incident hurt me so much,\u201d Elina says, tears running down her face as she looks down at her baby, Precious. The baby is named after Elina\u2019s niece, Sibongile Precious Morudu (28), who was by her aunt\u2019s side on the street and helped deliver the baby.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d Sibongile says, \u201cbut with God\u2019s grace I managed.\u201d\n\nThe nurses wouldn\u2019t allow Elina into the clinic, she adds, even though she was clearly in distress. Why? Because of her age.\n\n\u201cThe [nurses] started shouting, saying they wouldn\u2019t help her because she was too high risk. They threw her clinic card at us and told us to go to Mamelodi Regional Hospital.\u201d\n\nAs the women left the clinic, confused and scared, Elina\u2019s water broke and she began screaming for help. Sibongile pleaded with the nurses but was again told to go to the hospital.\n\n\u201cI helped my aunt sit down and then I saw the baby\u2019s head coming out. I took off my jacket to protect the baby from falling on the pavement or getting cold. I told her \u2018push\u2019 and she did. She was crying in pain,\u201d Sibongile says.\n\n\u201cBefore I knew it the baby was out and still no one had come to assist us. I took the baby from between her thighs and folded my jacket around her.\u201d\n\nElina didn\u2019t expect any problems with the birth as she\u2019d been going for regular checkups at the clinic in her area. She also had four other children so she wasn\u2019t new to pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nOn the Sunday night she went into labour, she and Sibongile asked a neighbor to drive them to Mamelodi Regional Hospital, where she\u2019d been scheduled to deliver her baby, but on the way the car ran out of petrol.\n\nDesperate, the two women hailed a taxi to the nearest clinic, Stanza Bopape II Clinic in Mamelodi East. They arrived at 8 pm and were allegedly told to go to Mamelodi Regional Hospital. The nurses gave no explanation as to why they refused to help Elina, apart from saying she was high risk, Sibongile claims.\n\nA pregnant woman is considered \u201cgeriatric\u201d or of \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d if she falls pregnant after the age of 34. These pregnancies are often classified as high risk due to the increased risk of premature birth, stillbirth, chromosomal defects in the baby and labour complications.\n\nAfter the baby was born outside the clinic gates, Sibongile placed the crying child on Elina\u2019s chest, with the umbilical cord attached. She then ran back inside the clinic with a security guard who had watched the birth. They told the nurses Elina had given birth, and only then were they allowed into the clinic.\n\nHowever, the humiliation didn\u2019t end there, the women claim. The nurses allegedly shouted at Sibongile, accusing her of endangering the lives of her aunt and the newborn.\n\n\u201cThey said I could\u2019ve given them an infection because I used my bare hands to hold the baby. But my fear was the baby would fall on the pavement and die. I had to do something,\u201d\n\nMom and baby stayed overnight at the clinic and were transferred to Mamelodi Regional Hospital the following day. They were discharged a few days later.\n\nElina\u2019s husband, Thomas Rakhavha (50), is furious about what happened. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this from the clinic as it\u2019s a facility that\u2019s supposed to help the community,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSomeone has to be held accountable for this,\u201d adds Thomas, who works as a bartender in Pretoria. \u201cWe are broken by this and those responsible must answer.\u201d\n\nHe is, however, happy with the new addition to their family. The couple have four other children \u2013 Lettie (28), Peter (23), Josephine (19) and Angela (9), who all dote on their little sister.\n\n\u201cThe pregnancy came as a surprise but we embraced it,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t think such a hurtful delivery would happen.\u201d\n\nSibongile and the Mamelodi Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) reported the incident at the Mamelodi East police station.\n\nBobby Mohanoe, the chairperson of the Mamelodi TAC, says Elina\u2019s alleged treatment is in contravention of the National Health Act. The TAC wants the nurses to be reported to the South African Nursing Council and fired.\n\n\u201cWe plan to interact with the department of health to start an internal disciplinary hearing as soon as they have finalized their internal investigations. We will also ensure that the family receives counselling and we\u2019ll keep on supporting the family until the matter is finalised,\u201d Mohanoe says.\n\nThe TAC has also reported the case to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) \u201cfor a human rights violation investigation and we\u2019re looking at a civil litigation compensation claim\u201d, Mohanoe says.\n\nAfter visiting the clinic, Buang Jones, provincial manager of the SAHRC, said it was facing \u201cmany challenges\u201d. He said some nurses were burnt out and there is no doctor at the facility.\n\n\u201cThe maternity ward is too small. There is no filing system. There are staff shortages. The maternity ward only has eight beds. There are only two midwives and a student nurse. There is no administrative support and they have only one computer,\u201d Jones told the media after his inspection.\n\nThe department of health has assured the family that investigations are under way and that its district office has also launched an investigation. District manager Mothomone Pitsi has apologised to the family.\n\n\u201cThis is not how we manage patients. Even if this mother was high risk, the expectation would have been for her to be examined properly and then an ambulance called to take her to a hospital,\u201d Pitsi says.\n\nHe\u2019s promised that a team of labour relations officials will investigate and report back within a month with a recommended course of action. Until then, Elina is trying to come to terms with what happened to her.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t deserve that treatment. No one does,\u201d she says.", "description": "DRUM visits the Mamelodi mother who was left to give birth outside a clinic because she was too old.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9461/cc4ba6e1ce32401182641bccdec46eac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
