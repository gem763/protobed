They\u2019re about the very identity of the European Union.\n\nUnderstanding your opponents \u2014 and getting your way \u2014 sometimes requires you to look past the clauses and articles at what the battle is really about.\n\nHere\u2019s a short guide to decrypting the EU\u2019s thorniest disagreements.\n\nWhat we talk about when we talk about trade: Liberalism\n\nThe EU, some argue, is essentially a \u201cliberal empire\u201d \u2014 one whose legitimacy rests on its core values: liberal democracy, constitutional government and individual liberty.\n\nSo what happens when this system is challenged not just by champions of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d like Hungarian leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n, but also by heavyweight countries such as France and Germany? That\u2019s exactly what occurred when Paris and Berlin pushed for the merger of two of Europe\u2019s biggest rail market suppliers, Siemens and Alstom, to create a European champion able to compete with Chinese rival CRRC. They were rebuffed in February by the European Commission\u2019s competition authority, which found the merger \u201cwould have harmed competition\u201d and \u201cresulted in higher prices for the signalling systems.\u201d France and Germany, predictably, cried foul.\n\nAs China rises and its illiberal political model proves to be economically successful, the EU faces a quandary: Should it compromise its free-market soul to protect itself from Beijing?\n\nWhat we talk about when we talk about migration: The single market\n\nThe 2015 migration crisis may have faded from the headlines, but the incoming legislature will still be wrestling with the political fallout.\n\nThe biggest headache ahead is a stalled effort to reform the so-called Dublin regulation, which stipulates that the country in which an asylum seeker first arrives has to take responsibility for any claims of protection. This policy has placed an outsized burden on border countries such as Greece and Italy, which have pushed for asylum seekers to be redistributed across the bloc.\n\nShould Berlin miss Macron\u2019s train, it\u2019s easy to imagine history not looking back kindly on Germany\u2019s role in stalling much-needed reforms.\n\nHow to ease that burden has become a vexed question. Can the EU force another country to show \u201csolidarity\u201d and take in refugees? Should governments be able to lend support in other ways \u2014 by offering financial help, for example \u2014 if they don\u2019t want to take people in?\n\nSo far, all attempts to find common ground have collapsed. This has far-reaching implications because the future of the Dublin regulation is directly linked to the future of the Schengen free passport zone, whose reform is also under discussion.\n\nIn response to the 2015 crisis, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway reintroduced checks at their internal borders due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d (France also conducts border checks because of a persistent terror threat.) If another refugee crisis were to hit, with no mechanism in place to redistribute asylum seekers, it\u2019s likely a greater number of countries would choose to reinstate internal border controls to keep people out.\n\nShould that happen, the travel-free Schengen zone \u2014 crucial for doing business across the EU \u2014 could collapse entirely. That would end the single market as we know it. It would also be very expensive: If trade barriers are reintroduced within Europe, GDP would drop by 8 percent in Germany and 7 percent in Italy, for example, according to the European Central Bank.\n\nWhat we talk about when we talk about financial markets: Macron and the single currency\n\nThe debt crisis that hit Europe at the start of the decade taught us that maintaining price stability \u2014 the European Central Bank\u2019s primary goal \u2014 is not enough to prevent the collapse of banks across the Continent.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plans to reform the eurozone \u2014 which include a dedicated budget and some remedies for the bloc\u2019s lack of a common fiscal policy \u2014 is aimed at fixing some EU oddities, including the fact that the common currency area has no Treasury. When he presented his ideas in a speech at Sorbonne University almost two years ago, Macron hoped he had kicked the ball firmly into Germany's court. But that\u2019s not quite how it played out.\n\nOnce Germany was the one pushing for more integration and France was the reluctant partner. Now their roles appear to have reversed, with Germany blocking efforts to create a shared budget. \u201cThere is no progress with the deepening of the monetary union because the Netherlands, Austria and all too often Germany stand in the way when it comes to solidarity in action and joint responsibility,\u201d outgoing Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker told German newspaper Handelsblatt in May.\n\nThe danger is similar to the one looming over migration talks: If disaster strikes, things could unravel quickly. Should Berlin miss Macron\u2019s train, it\u2019s easy to imagine history not looking back kindly on Germany\u2019s role in stalling much-needed reforms.\n\nWhat we talk about when we talk about health care: Angry voters\n\nEurope is aging fast. The eurozone\u2019s old-age dependency ratio \u2014 the number of people aged 65 and over as a percentage of the working-age population \u2014 is expected to rise steeply, from just above 30 percent in 2016 to about 52 percent by 2070, according to estimates by Eurostat, the EU statistics bureau. Add to this high prices for many drugs, and you\u2019ve got a lethal combination.\n\nHealth care is fast becoming a political hot potato across the bloc. In Finland, former Prime Minister Juha Sipil\u00e4 was forced to resign over a failed health care reform in March, despite the fact that, after the 2008 financial crisis, Helsinki oversaw the largest increase in money spent on social protection relative to GDP in any EU country.\n\nTo rein in rising costs, some countries \u2014 including Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria and Ireland \u2014 have teamed up to negotiate cheaper drugs. The project is still in its initial stages but it has inspired other countries to follow suit.\n\nFew are delusional enough to think the EU will be able to defend itself from a Russian or Chinese attack without assistance from Washington.\n\nIn Europe\u2019s south, the so-called Valletta Declaration group \u2014 Malta, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and a few others \u2014 is trying to achieve something similar. Meanwhile, the Council is stuck with a Commission proposal to introduce a health technology assessment mechanism that is supposed to make it easier for countries to decide whether to introduce a new drug.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake is a big part of the EU\u2019s identity. The bloc accounts for just 7 percent of the world\u2019s population and 25 percent of its GDP, but it is also the source of 50 percent of its welfare. If the EU can\u2019t find ways to bring costs down, voters may see yet another reason to turn to Euroskeptic or nationalist politicians promising to find ways to better protect citizens.\n\nWhat we talk about when we talk about defense: Promoting industry\n\nThere\u2019s a major gap in Europe\u2019s ability to stand on its own: If it were to come under military attack, it wouldn\u2019t be able to defend itself without help from the United States.\n\nTo build up its capabilities, the EU launched a new military pact known as PESCO and a new multiannual fund, the European Defense Fund, which will funnel\n\n\u20ac13 billion into the EU\u2019s next long-term budget to boost the bloc\u2019s industrial prowess and keep it from being reliant on the U.S. for military equipment. It wasn\u2019t hard to convince countries to cooperate: Defense is one of the few areas where governments are happy to work together more closely \u2014 especially as Washington becomes an increasingly volatile and difficult diplomatic partner.\n\nStill, few are delusional enough to think the EU will be able to defend itself from a Russian or Chinese attack without assistance from Washington anytime soon. In reality, the push for \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d is about something else: reviving the idea of Europe as an industrial project.\n\nThe EU took its first steps as a group of countries wanting a common market to buy and sell steel and coal. To some, the question underlying the debate about the EU\u2019s military capabilities is whether a common goal on defense can kickstart a new industrial alliance that gives new life \u2014 and a greater raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 to the European project.\n\nChristian Oliver, John Rega and Carmen Paun contributed reporting.", "description": "POLITICO\u2019s guide to unpicking what\u2019s fueling the Continent\u2019s biggest feuds.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bordercheck_380x240-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
