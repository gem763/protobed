These recommendations are usually risk/reward commodities meant to be used in large-field tournaments. Typically, blending these low-owned hidden gems with well-aligned staples contributes to a viable GPP strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the following player write-ups were constructed earlier in the day, and sometimes injury/rest situations can alter the fantasy landscape. Monitoring our MLB News & Headlines Feed throughout the day will keep you in the loop while giving you the subsequent DFS consequences of each information piece.\n\nWe will be looking at the seven-game main slate beginning at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nJohn Means - Baltimore (vs. Texas)\n\nMeans is probably the best pitcher Baltimore has to offer, as the 26-year-old southpaw holds an impressive 3.55 ERA through 124.1 major league innings this season. He\u2019s coming off a pair of quality starts with 11 strikeouts through 14 innings and three earned runs against Kansas City and Tampa Bay. There\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll keep that momentum in this plum matchup against Texas, who ranks 27th in wRC+ to left-handed pitching with the highest strikeout rate (26.3%) in that regard.\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nGarrett Cooper - Miami (at Pittsburgh)\n\nPittsburgh RHP Dario Agrazal has only tossed 54 major league innings, but the initial results haven\u2019t exactly been promising, as the rookie holds a 6.25 xFIP to go along with a .393 wOBA split to right-handed bats. That\u2019s where Garrett Cooper and company come in, and the Miami first baseman is heating up with five hits, two doubles, and five RBIs over his past two games.\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nHanser Alberto - Baltimore (vs. Texas)\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s a limited sample size, but Hanser Alberto has been special against left-handed pitching this season. The Baltimore infielder holds an impressive 167 wRC+ to go along with a .424 wOBA mark in that regard. On top of that, Alberto is swinging a confident bat with 10 hits, six runs, and a homer over his last five games. Put it all together, and the Baltimore second baseman profiles as a sneaky-good candidate against Texas LHP Kolby Allard and company.\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJon Berti - Miami (at Pittsburgh)\n\nBerti has been serving as the leadoff man for Miami, relishing that role with 11 hits, two homers, nine runs, and four stolen bases over his last ten starts. As that previous sentence suggests, he offers some intriguing power/speed upside for fantasy purposes. Berti will have a chance to put that on full display in the aforementioned matchup against Pittsburgh RHP Agrazal\u2019s .393 wOBA split to right-handed bats.\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nWilly Adames - Tampa Bay (vs. Toronto)\n\nAdames hasn\u2019t done much lately, but he\u2019s looking at a breakout opportunity against the Blue Jays tonight. The Tampa shortstop will initially step in against Toronto RHP Trent Thornton\u2019s .345 wOBA split to right-handed bats. He could also make some noise against a bottom-ten Blue Jays\u2019 bullpen that holds a 4.80 FIP on the season. In other words, Adames is dirt-cheap while holding some respectable upside for this well-aligned Tampa offense.\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nAvisail Garcia - Tampa Bay (vs. Toronto)\n\nGarcia is another sneaky-good candidate within an interesting Rays\u2019 stack. Teammates like Tommy Pham and Austin Meadows are the highlight options from Tampa, but let\u2019s not forget about Garcia for a substantially cheaper salary. Avisail is a multi-hit candidate with some power to boot, and I like his chances against Toronto RHP Thornton and the aforementioned subpar Jays\u2019 bullpen.\n\nJake Cave - Minnesota (at Boston)\n\nCave has been getting regular playing time for Minnesota lately, making the most of his opportunities with a pair of multi-homer games over the past two weeks. Cave is a well-rounded hitter looking to take advantage of the hitter-friendly dimensions of Fenway Park this evening. The matchup plays into his favor, facing Boston RHP Nathan Eovaldi\u2019s 6.23 ERA on the season.", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds some sneaky-good MLB GPP Pivots away from the popular picks for Thursday, September 5.
