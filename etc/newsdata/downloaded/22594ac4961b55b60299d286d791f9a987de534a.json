All politicians like to show some evidence of wanting \u201cchange\u201d, but in Labour \u2013 as with other parties of the left \u2013 there is often an appetite for a renewed statement of ideological intent. As the world changes, and as party leaderships change, there are different views as to what the party\u2019s core objectives should be. So leaders consider whether they need something new.\n\nEver since the party\u2019s 1959 election defeat, the statement of aims in its constitution has been the obvious place to go \u2013 known simply as \u201cClause IV\u201d. Hugh Gaitskell pushed to rewrite Clause IV in 1959, and Tony Blair saw it rewritten for a new era when he became leader in 1994. It evidenced change to an electorate still uncertain about Labour\u2019s intentions, and it allowed Blair\u2019s \u201cNew\u201d Labour to revise its aims for a very different world.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow, there is a new grassroots effort underway to get the clause rewritten \u2013 but the leadership is having none of it. Instead, there will be a \u201cworking group\u201d set up of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee, a process designed to convince Labour conference delegates to withdraw motions advocating a return to the \u201cold\u201d Clause IV and to park the issue altogether.\n\nIn fact, ever since the 2015 leadership election, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team has repeatedly walked back from rewriting Clause IV. The assumption among Corbyn\u2019s detractors is that any rewrite would hark back to early 20th-century Labour, rather than looking forward to the world as it is today, and that the leadership might simply find doing so too politically sensitive. But the real obstacles to changing the clause long predate the Corbyn era.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

But two obstacles always get in the way: the symbolic nature of the current Clause IV, and the question of what on earth you\u2019d replace it with.\n\nFor the first decade or so of its life, Labour\u2019s constitution didn\u2019t carry a word about its programme or political objectives. What became known simply as \u201cClause IV\u201d was agreed in 1918; it didn\u2019t mention socialism, but it did commit the party to \u201ccommon ownership of the means of production\u201d.\n\nIt was open to interpretation, seeking to appeal across what was already a broad church of the British left. But it became a symbol; as the political scientist Henry Drucker said, it held Labour \u201ctrue to its past, true to what its originators wanted it to be: for labour and against capital\u201d.\n\nBut since Clement Attlee\u2019s tenure, leaders have taken their own views on the party\u2019s objectives. Gaitskell believed that a widespread perception of large-scale nationalisation had lost the party votes. Today, his proposed revisions would mark a radical socialist departure, not a moderating effort \u2013 but he lost his battle nonetheless. Harold Wilson subsequently called Gaitskell\u2019s failed move an attempt to \u201ctake Genesis out of the Bible\u201d; he ignored Clause IV altogether, and set out his own \u201cwhite heat\u201d socialist programme through speeches instead.\n\nThe subject came up again in Neil Kinnock\u2019s time, but he decided against any clarification. So too did John Smith. The question was often: \u201cWhy fight this now?\u201d\n\nThe same question will be asked within Corbyn\u2019s team, as Blair\u2019s change to Clause IV has taken on its own symbolism \u2013 the moment when Labour \u201cmodernised\u201d and won.\n\nBut once again, the problem is what the replacement statement would look like. Blair\u2019s commitment to rewrite Clause IV was made with little idea of what to replace it with. In the end, the rewritten text was very clear about what Labour wasn\u2019t \u2013 a party of nationalisation \u2013 and with Labour in the ascendant for the first time in decades, that was enough.\n\nDuring the 2015 Labour leadership contest, Yvette Cooper suggested reworking it again to include clearer statements about tackling inequality. But Corbyn\u2019s team elected instead to make their most powerful statement of intent with the 2017 manifesto. While it failed to win Corbyn an election, it is widely perceived within Labour as having helped him defy expectations.\n\nSince then, and as Ed Miliband tweeted recently, Labour\u2019s \u201ctoo well-hidden secret\u201d is an economic agenda that unites different Labour figures and is far more critical of the status quo than any it has advanced in recent decades.\n\nOne obvious way to make it less hidden would be a high-profile debate about the party\u2019s core objectives, and a commitment to bring them up to date. But preoccupied with hypothetical referendums and looming elections, both of which are exacerbating Labour\u2019s bitter divisions, Corbyn seems keen to avoid meddling with the party\u2019s core statements of intent.\n\nPolitically speaking, that\u2019s understandable. But the lesson from former Labour leaders is that \u2013 whatever Corbyn wants \u2013 this will never go away.\n\nDr Karl Pike teaches and researches in the school of politics and international relations at Queen Mary, University of London", "description": "The Labour Party is often searching for a big idea. All politicians like to show some evidence of wanting \u201cchange\u201d, but in Labour \u2013 as with other parties of the left \u2013 there is often an appetite for a renewed statement of ideological intent. As the world changes, and as party leaderships change, there are different views as to what the party\u2019s core objectives should be.
