Ansel Elgort is apparently unfamiliar with the term \u201cfriendship\u201d.\n\nTalking to The Times about his aspirations, Ansel said he would\u2019ve liked to have done a few plays and performed his own music. Also, he wants to \u201cfind a lot more love.\u201d\n\nAnsel has been dating dancer Violetta Komyshan for years now, they\u2019re high school sweethearts.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be sexual. I could be done sexually with my girlfriend,\u201d Ansel explained. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been pretty clear that I want to feel free to fall in love with people and that [option] should be open, but sexually it can be closed off.\u201d\n\nAnsel added that he\u2019s in love with a bunch of his male friends who he\u2019s not keen on having sex with.\n\n\u201cSo why can\u2019t I put the desire to have sex with women aside and let myself have love with women.\u201d\n\nSo, again\u2026 a friend?\n\n\u201cI love Shailene Woodley and we never had anything sexual and that was great,\u201d Ansel said. \u201cThere will probably be some sort of chemical thing at some point that you can\u2019t help, but you just have to be disciplined and not be a f- \u2026We\u2019re primitive beings.\u201d\n\nAnsel (Augustus Waters) and Shailene (Hazel Grac Lancaster) starred as the romantic leads in the movie adaptation of John Green\u2018s The Fault In Our Stars. They also acted together in The Divergent series, but as brother and sister.\n\nSafe to say Twitter is just as perplexed as I am.\n\nansel elgort on god we're going to help you learn about friendship bro pic.twitter.com/ixGtu4KTDN \u2014 sophie grace (@monseans) September 30, 2019\n\nAnd infuriated. People are infuriated too.\n\nI've come back to Twitter because I can't deal with how insufferable Ansel Elgort is so I'm unloading it on you. xoxo pic.twitter.com/FBAZn5KfYe \u2014 Cinesthesia (@keylightblog) September 30, 2019\n\nAs an aside, I visited Ansel\u2019s Instagram and he recently posted a whole slew of topless selfies in a row. 17 of them, actually.
