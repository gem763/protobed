Privately, her firm helped negotiate a settlement that muffled one of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s victims in 2004, taking a 40 percent cut. (The firm has also worked on settlements that silenced victims of Larry Nassar and Bill O\u2019Reilly.) In an interview for \u201cShe Said,\u201d Allred defends her use of confidential settlements, arguing that clients are not forced to sign them and often prefer them for reasons of privacy.\n\nAllred\u2019s daughter, the lawyer Lisa Bloom, a prominent victims\u2019 rights attorney, was working behind the scenes with Mr. Weinstein \u2014 at a rate of $895 an hour \u2014 to quash the journalists\u2019 investigation and thwart his accusers. In a confidential memo to Mr. Weinstein that Ms. Bloom wrote in December 2016, which is reproduced in \u201cShe Said,\u201d she offered to help him damage the reputation of one of his accusers, Rose McGowan, and portrayed her background as a victims\u2019s rights advocate as an asset.\n\n\u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them,\u201d Ms. Bloom wrote, before laying out a multistep playbook for how to intimidate accusers or paint them as liars. One of Ms. Bloom\u2019s suggested tactics for undermining Ms. McGowan: \u201cWe can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she\u2019s discredited.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom accompanied Mr. Weinstein on a surprise visit to the Times the day before the initial article was published, to present the journalists with information intended to portray several accusers \u2014 including Ashley Judd, the first actress to go on the record \u2014 as unreliable and mentally unstable.\n\nMs. Bloom has said she was crossing sides to work for Weinstein to encourage him to apologize for his behavior. She later told the reporters that she \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d representing him, which she said was a \u201ccolossal mistake.\u201d\n\nAnother member of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s legal team, the attorney David Boies, helped Mr. Weinstein evade scrutiny for his treatment of women over 15 years, working to halt reporting on the producer by news outlets, blocking the board of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s company from reviewing his personnel file, and helping Mr. Weinstein execute a contract with Black Cube, an Israeli private investigations firm, that was promised a $300,000 bonus if it stopped the Times investigation. (Ronan Farrow, who published a separate Weinstein expos\u00e9 in The New Yorker in October 2017, later broke the news of Black Cube\u2019s work for Weinstein.) \u201cShe Said\u201d reveals emails showing that during the time that Mr. Boies represented Mr. Weinstein, the two men discussed potential film roles for Mr. Boies\u2019s daughter, an aspiring actress.", "description": "\u201cShe Said,\u201d by The New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, names some of the people who turned against the influential producer, as well as ones who helped cover up his alleged predation.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/books/06Shesaid1/06Shesaid1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
