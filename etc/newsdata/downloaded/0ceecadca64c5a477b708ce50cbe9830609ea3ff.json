Is it my father's fault? I just want to know why.\"\n\nManoa Talavalu was 52 years old when he was killed off the coast of Newfoundland, allegedly by a Latvian man. Police in Canada said they did not have jurisdiction to press charges. (Submitted by Lupe Samuel)\n\nManoa Talavalu was a 52-year-old sailor from Tuvalu \u2014 a small cluster of sandy islands struggling to stay above water in the South Pacific.\n\nHe spent most of his time on boats. Samuel remembers he would come home for about a month at a time, and then head to sea again. His travels took him all around the world.\n\nIn April 2005, he left Boston aboard the Nordscot \u2014 a Liberian-flagged oil tanker bound for the Come By Chance refinery in eastern Newfoundland.\n\nThe Nordscot is pictured in the Boston area two months before Talavalu was killed aboard. (Christian Brathen/Shipspotting)\n\nTwo days before reaching its destination, Talavalu got into an argument with a Latvian man. Samuel was 20 years old when she met another sailor on the ship, who told her his account of what happened.\n\n\"He was arguing with a guy. They got into a fight. Then my father punched him,\" she said.\n\nHer father went to his room. The next morning his door was locked and there was no answer when crew members came knocking. He was dead inside with bruises on his head.\n\nNews of the killing came and went without fanfare in Newfoundland and Labrador \u2014 a few brief mentions on the radio, some write-ups online and then no followup for 14 years.\n\nA body was taken off an oil tanker in Come By Chance in 2005. The details around the sailor's death have remained a mystery to his family ever since. (North Atlantic Refining Limited Partnership)\n\nPolice confirmed in 2005 they suspected a Latvian man had killed Talavalu on international waters, but said they didn't take a statement from the man when the boat docked in Come By Chance.\n\nAccording to the RCMP, the crime happened outside its jurisdiction and did not involve any Canadians so they had no reason to investigate further.\n\nThat drew the ire of Liberian officials, who said they would have conducted their own investigation if they knew a crime had been committed. Scott Bergeron, until recently the head of the Liberian ship registry, said the RCMP didn't reach out until eight days after the man was killed.\n\nBy that time, Talavalu's body was on its way to the South Pacific and the suspect had gone home to Latvia.\n\nIt was too late.\n\n'You look like your father'\n\nFourteen years later, Samuel still remembers her mother getting the phone call. They assumed he had died of an illness at sea.\n\nThey didn't know anything else until two other Tuvaluan sailors returned home with a tale of homicide on the high seas.\n\n\"I didn't even get any answer from the police,\" Samuel said. \"No statement or police report from when my father was killed. It's sad that they didn't even clarify what [had] happened.\"\n\nTalavalu's daughter holds a tiny picture of her father in her hands. He died 14 years ago, and she's still waiting for answers. (Submitted by Lupe Samuel)\n\nSamuel said she wasn't curious about what happened for a long time \u2014 until she ended up working alongside one of the sailors six years ago.\n\n\"He told me, 'You look like your father,'\" she said. \"He said he was with my father on the boat at the time he passed away. And then he told me the story.\"\n\nSamuel has a few photos of her father and memories of the brief time he was in her life. She doesn't have any sense of justice, knowing her father's killer is still out there \u2014 perhaps on land in Latvia, or at sea around the world, where nobody knows what he's done.\n\n\"I feel so sad,\" she said. \"The people there shouldn't have let that guy [have] freedom.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "Canadian police had a suspect, but they let him go.
