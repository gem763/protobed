(AP) - A Pennsylvania hospital is racing to determine the source of a waterborne germ that appears to have infected at least eight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, three of whom have died, officials said Monday.\n\nGeisinger Medical Center in Danville has begun sending very premature newborns and some expectant mothers to other facilities while officials investigate, the hospital said.\n\nFour babies have recovered from an infection caused by the Pseudomonas bacterium, and one is still being treated with antibiotics, the hospital said.\n\nOfficials said they are working with state and federal health authorities to ensure the bacteria have been eradicated.\n\nThe bacteria are common and often harmless but can cause disease in \u201cvery fragile patients,\u201d Dr. Frank Maffei, the hospital\u2019s chair of pediatrics, said at a news conference.\n\nThe deaths, he said, \u201cmay have been a result of the infection complicating an already vulnerable state.\u201d\n\nAs a precaution, the hospital is transferring babies born at less than 32 weeks\u2019 gestation to other hospitals and diverting other expected premature deliveries to other hospitals. Full-term pregnancies amount to 40 weeks of gestation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that we are only talking about diverting these very premature infants, less than 32 weeks, both the moms who would be delivering at that age or the babies already born,\u201d said Dr. Rosemary Leeming, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nDoctors said they first became aware of an unusual infection in early August.\n\nThe neonatal intensive care unit is inside a children\u2019s hospital that is part of a larger campus. It could take weeks to determine how the infections occurred, although it\u2019s likely the pathogen was brought in from outside the children\u2019s hospital, investigators said.\n\nCultures of the water supply and surfaces inside the neonatal intensive care unit, where all the infections occurred, tested negative for Pseudomonas, officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really too soon to say exactly where the organism is coming from, but the information we have so far suggests that it\u2019s someplace outside of the neonatal intensive care unit,\u201d said Dr. Mark Shelly, Geisinger\u2019s director of infection control and prevention.\n\nThe hospital has increased chlorination of water, bolstered water filtering, performed extra cleaning and changed some of its processes.\n\nThe investigation may not reveal exactly what went wrong, Shelly said.\n\nSeven of the eight babies were born at less than 26 weeks of gestation, and the eighth was born at less than 27 weeks\u2019, according to the hospital.\n\nThe Danville hospital\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit treats more than 600 babies a year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Pennsylvania hospital is racing to determine the source of a waterborne germ that appears to have infected at least eight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, three of whom have died, officials said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
