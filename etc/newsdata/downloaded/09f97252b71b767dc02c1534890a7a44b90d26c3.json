They deserve to grow up thinking that they can be anything they want.\n\n'When a government is scared by a children's book promoting equality, that means that promoting these messages through children's literature can have and is having an impact, and it makes me even more motivated to keep fighting every day.'\n\nThe book was launched on April 27, 2016 via a stratospheric Kickstarter campaign that drew worldwide attention.\n\nThe creators: Elena Favilli (left) co-founded the company Timbuktu with her co-partner Francesca Cavallo (right). Ms Cavallo said on Friday that she was saddened by the Turkish government's decision\n\nBy the end of its run, a staggering 13,454 backers had pledged $675, 614 to help bring the project to life.\n\nThe only difficulty it encountered previously was Russia's decision to censor the story of a transgender girl profiled in the book, Cavallo said.\n\nMurat Celikkan, of the Human Rights Association in Istanbul, said: 'Finding women who have overcome the obstacles of a gendered world dangerous shows the mindset of rulers in Turkey.\n\n'Now I am much more anxious about the future of my five-year-old daughter in this country.'\n\nThe Turkish publishers' association released a statement this week, saying the government decision was 'a danger from the perspective of freedoms of expression and press, and a threat to the principles of a democratic society'.\n\nThe book's Turkish publisher told AFP they were waiting for the decision to be officially communicated to them before commenting.", "description": "Good Night Stories For Rebel Girls\u00a0tells true stories of influential women throughout history.
