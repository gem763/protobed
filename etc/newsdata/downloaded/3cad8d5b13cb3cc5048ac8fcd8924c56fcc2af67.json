Something to be said to make a controversy die down but nothing which has any sincerity behind it.\n\nIt seems, however, that they are taking it more seriously than we anticipated. From Goold at the Post-Disptach:\n\nWhen fans arrived at SunTrust Park for Game 5 of the National League Division Series, one of the most important playoff games for the Atlanta Braves in more than a decade, there was something missing from their seats Wednesday, something subtle.\n\nThe foam tomahawks that had been placed at each seat before games 1 and 2 of this series against the Cardinals were not there this time.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoold reports that, yes, the Braves removed the foam tomahawks in response to Helsley\u2019s comments. They said there will be \u201cother changes\u201d during the in-game programming as well. It\u2019s unclear if that means that the Braves will stop prompting fans to do the chop via the pumped-in music and all of that, but we\u2019ll find out in a couple of hours.\n\nAs we have written in the past, there is no way for the Braves to prohibit fans from performing the gesture and raising the cheer which the club initiated nearly 30 years ago and which it has encouraged ever since. Fans can do it and I suspect will certainly still do it tonight, using their arms in a chopping motion rather than the foam tomahawks. They\u2019ll probably do it even louder if Helsley gets in the game. Sensitivity on this score has never been the strong suit of most Braves fans and, when challenged, most have doubled or tripled down on what they feel is their right and duty to offend those who might take issue with them. In this they are like a lot of fan groups, sadly.\n\nBut the Braves do not have to, and should not, be encouraging it and amplifying it the way they have. Mostly because it is wildly insensitive and inappropriate in the year 2019 \u2014 or any year \u2014 for a professional sports organization to be associating itself with racist caricatures of Native American culture, be it in the form of a logo or a gesture. But also because Major League Baseball itself has already made it clear that they find such things inappropriate in the ballpark via their handling of the Chief Wahoo controversy with the Indians. Indeed, just last February Rob Manfred, in his own somewhat incoherent way, at least suggested that Major League Baseball would like to see the Braves cut it out. Not that he\u2019s taken any steps to make that happen.\n\nI have long suspected that if the Braves stopped with the organ music, the drums, the scoreboard prompts and the foam tomahawks that fans will continue to do the chop, but only for a while. Eventually it\u2019ll die down and become far less prominent a part of the ballpark culture in Atlanta. It\u2019ll recede into the same level of an occasional \u201cLet\u2019s go [team]\u201d chant, occasionally initiated but never dominating the proceedings.\n\nIf today is the first step in that direction, it\u2019s a very, very welcome development.\n\nUPDATE: A good point or three about this was made on Twitter. The short version:\n\nWonder if the Braves execs are actually foolish enough to think they're walking a tightrope properly here, instead of openly admitting they have to phase the Chop out. \u2014 Nathan Bernhardt (@jonbernhardt) October 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIn taking today\u2019s action, they have acknowledged \u2014 for the first time in 30 years as far as I can tell \u2014 that the Tomahawk Chop is racially insensitive. The impetus for doing so is that a specific Native American player complained. The Braves cannot, however, simply not do the Chop stuff for this game or future games in which Helsley appears, can they? I mean, your dad can choose not to tell racist jokes when minorities are within earshot and then go back to doing it when they\u2019re not, but a multi-billion dollar media/real estate/entertainment empire which beams its games all over the planet really can\u2019t do that, can they?\n\nWhich is to say: good for the Braves here, but only if they carry through with this in the only logical way a moral actor can and eliminate the Chop entirely. Because now that they have acknowledged its offensiveness, it will, actually, be worse if they just do it for this game and then resume doing that which they have already acknowledged is wrong.", "description": "The move comes in response to Cardinals reliever -- and member of the Cherokee Nation -- Ryan Helsley's comments", "authors": ["Craig Calcaterra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TWH.XLQeKXo7yokTh3Igyw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7ZDRI9d1yi5a8s3jL7f_sw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/a50b0ba0f72bd537012b007142a7b48d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
