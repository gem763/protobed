The weather predicted this week would be enough to stop England from training, although the forecast in Miyazaki \u2013 where a 10-day training camp is planned from Tuesday \u2013 looks much better to the point that it could prove too hot for the players as temperatures in excess of 31 degrees Celsius will feel much hotter due to the lack of wind.\n\n\u201cWe have done a fair bit [of contingency planning],\u201d added Jones, who confirmed that they have provisions to train indoors on artificial turf if severe weather returns at some point during the tournament. \u201cWe would have an idea of what we would do if there was a typhoon that stopped us training outside.\u201d\n\nThat said, it is not something that the players and staff are overly looking forward to, and they will not know if they can even land in Tokyo on Monday morning until the later stages of their flight to the Far East.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to that!\u201d a nervous Ben Youngs laughed after he starred in the 37-0 victory over Italy. \u201cJust let me land, I don\u2019t mind being in it once we\u2019ve landed but just let me land! It\u2019s a scary thought. Gengey [Ellis Genge] was telling me he\u2019d been watching videos of planes landing in typhoons and I\u2019m thinking \u2018oh please no\u2019. But Eddie\u2019s told us to download plenty of films on the iPad because we could travel the world a few times before we land!\u201d\n\nAs much as the weather could have an impact on plans off the field, so too could it have a say on what happens on it. The Australian believes the hot conditions seen in Friday\u2019s Test between Japan and South Africa in Kumagaya which are expected to feature again during the tournament will change how sides are able to attack, given the difficulty it causes in keeping possession of the ball.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa played Japan and it was very hot, very humid, a lot of dropped balls. The ball was very greasy. That could increase the amount of kicking,\u201d explained Jones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a night in Tokyo. Then we will fly out to Miyazaki and have three or four days or reconditioning and then start training next Saturday. We just want them to get them out and about.\u201d", "description": "England Rugby have known for quite some time that they will need to conquer New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, Wales and the like to win the Rugby World Cup, but no one expected them to be taking on Faxai.
