Over the past few months, you\u2019ll most likely have noticed how popular they\u2019ve proven. Digital designer Teresa Fogolari\u2019s Plastica filter, which will shrink your nose, raise your cheekbones and give you a dangerously big pout, has been used over 200 million times.\n\n\n\nBut the company behind Instagram\u2019s AR face filter feature, Spark AR, have just announced their plans to root out and ban these filters that give user's a plastic surgery-esque aesthetic, in an attempt to curb the spread of body dysmorphia throughout the platform.\n\n\u201cWe want Spark AR effects to be a positive experience and are re-evaluating our existing policies as they relate to well-being,\u201d the company said in a statement posted to Facebook, before mentioning that they\u2019d be removing all of the current effects associated with plastic surgery, postponing the approval of any new ones, while removing as many policy-violating effects as they\u2019re identified for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile it might seem like an excuse to spoil a bit of online fun, a 2018 study showed that \u201cexposure to idealized Instagram images (attractive peers, celebrities) has a detrimental impact on body image\u201d. So pair that with the opportunity to completely switch-up your face, and the effects are bound to intensify. Spark haven\u2019t stated when the mass deletion will formally kick off, but with the pressure to formally tackle issues of self-esteem being felt from all sides, you can expect filters like Plastica to disappear from your IG stories sooner rather than later.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "It's the latest attempt to counter Insta-dysmorphia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dadb3236518eb000a8da653/lede/1571667928104-tumblr_pl1zowCkLr1u850vmo4_500.jpeg?crop=0.9457777777777778xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
