VIDEOS OBTAINED BY REUTERS/via REUTERS\n\nSaudi Arabia said it had brought the blazes under control, without specifying whether oil production or exports were affected. State television said exports were continuing.\n\nThe drone strikes on the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter come as state oil giant Saudi Aramco has accelerated plans for an initial public offering to as early as this year, and follow earlier cross-border attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters.\n\nSaudi Arabia, leading a coalition of Sunni Muslim countries that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis, has blamed Iran for previous attacks, which Tehran denies. Riyadh accuses Iran of arming the Houthis, a charge denied by the group and Tehran.\n\nThe extent of damage from the drone strikes in Abqaiq and Khurais provinces remains unclear. Nine hours after the pre-dawn attacks, Aramco has issued no statement and the authorities have not reported on casualties.\n\nAbqaiq is located 60 km (37 miles) southwest of Aramco\u2019s Dhahran headquarters. It contains the world\u2019s largest oil processing plant, handling crude from the giant Ghawar field and for export to terminals Ras Tanura - the world\u2019s biggest offshore oil loading facility - and Juaymah. It also pumps westwards across the kingdom to Red Sea export terminals.\n\nKhurais, 190 km further southwest, contains the country\u2019s second largest oilfield.\n\nMany Western employees of Aramco live in Abqaiq. The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh said it was unaware of any injuries to Americans from the attacks.\n\nFIRE AND SMOKE\n\nHours after the strike in Abqaiq, a Reuters witness nearby said fire and smoke were still visible. Earlier video footage verified by Reuters showed bright flames and thick plumes of smoke rising towards the dark pre-dawn sky. An emergency vehicle is seen rushing towards the site.\n\nThe Saudi interior ministry spokesman said Aramco industrial security teams fighting the fires since 0400 (0100 GMT) had managed to control them and stop their spread. He did not identify the source of the drones but said an investigation was underway.\n\nThe Houthis\u2019 military spokesman, without providing evidence, said the attacks had achieved direct hits on refineries at both sites, which are over 1,000 km from the Yemeni capital Sanaa, and pledged a widening of attacks on Saudi Arabia.\n\nTensions in the region have escalated in recent months after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2018 landmark international nuclear deal and extended economic sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe Houthis hit Shaybah oilfield last month and two oil pumping stations in May. Both attacks caused fires but did not disrupt production.\n\nThe coalition has responded with air strikes on Houthi targets in Sanaa and other areas held by the group, which controls most large urban centres in Yemen.\n\nThe violence is complicating U.N.-led peace efforts to ease tensions between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia to pave the way for political talks to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.\n\nThe Yemen conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "description": "Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on Saturday attacked two Saudi Aramco plants, including the world's biggest oil processing facility, sparking fires in the latest flare up of violence in the Gulf.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429662841&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D00W", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
