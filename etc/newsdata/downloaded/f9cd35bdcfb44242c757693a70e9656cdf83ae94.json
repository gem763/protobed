It seems unlikely, say, that humans might find an untouched forest to study, someplace that hasn\u2019t been bulldozed and burnt and exploited within an inch of its life for precious minerals or virgin timber. But that\u2019s exactly what happened this past spring, when a Welsh researcher, Dr. Julian Bayliss, led a 28-person team that included scientists specially selected for their different talents as well as logistics experts, rock climbers, and filmmakers to the top of a mountain in Mozambique.\n\nThe story of the Mount Lico expedition began six years ago when Bayliss, a conservation scientist and butterfly expert, happened to spy a small forest atop a mountain using Google Earth. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d found such a place; Bayliss had been using Google Earth to explore high-altitude rainforests in Africa for around 15 years. In February 2017, the time was finally right: Bayliss brought a drone to the base of the 410-foot sheer rock protuberance (technically known as an inselberg) to confirm that there was a forest on top. This was no small feat. The area surrounding Mount Lico is a patchwork of smallholder farms, tea and eucalyptus plantations, and woodlands. There are no paved roads, no hotels \u2014 just rivers to cross, plants to hack away with machetes, and miles of dirt track to navigate.\n\nWhile locals were aware of Mount Lico and used the natural resources of surrounding forests, its tall, sheer walls meant that it was nearly impossible to access, which made it likely that the land on top was untouched by humans. However, scientists would later find out that someone had been up there at least once.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Topic.\n\nFor Bayliss and his team, Lico presented a unique opportunity to document our planet and its changing climate. Its forest is, as one member of the team later wrote, a \u201ctime capsule.\u201d Documenting Lico paves the way for preservation. It \u201cfits in to a much longer and wider conservation program for these mountains in northern Mozambique,\u201d notes Bayliss. And discovering new species and raising the profile of the region will help protect the surrounding ecosystems and create a more complete understanding of biodiversity in Mozambique, explains Hermenegildo Matimele, the expedition\u2019s Mozambican leader. Matimele adds that, in turn, conservation efforts would benefit local communities that rely on the region\u2019s forests for food and are negatively impacted by deforestation in the long term. \u201cIt\u2019s going to guide our strategies in terms of how we use the land,\u201d he says.\n\nFor two weeks this past May, Bayliss, Matimele, and a \u201cdream team\u201d of scientists finally convened in the mountains of Mozambique. They set up three camps: a base camp, a satellite camp atop Lico, and another camp at nearby Mount Socone, where, in recent years, farmers have been clearing the rainforest at an alarming rate. The expedition included two of the world\u2019s top climbers, who taught the scientists, on the fly, how to scale the rock face of a mountain; a chef; three Mozambican scientists, who documented the wildlife and plants; a trip logistics planner; a medical doctor; experts in everything from carbon dating to small mammals; and an 84-year-old butterfly specialist with a fondness for whiskey. We interviewed 23 members of the group to hear their tale. It was, for everyone involved, a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nInterviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nFINDING LICO\n\nThe initial reaction of the prospective explorers when they heard the news about an untouched forest? Wonder.\n\nJulian Bayliss (biodiversity and protected areas specialist, professor at Oxford Brookes University): I started systematically going across Northern Mozambique, scanning it using Google Earth satellite imagery. I came across this mountain range where Mount Socone is. It\u2019s in between Mabu and Namuli [two nearby mountains], which I knew about before. Just below that, I could see this sort of crater-like mountain with this dark, round patch. I thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s got to be a forest.\u201d I then zoomed in to that and was looking at detail. I could see that the surrounding land was all heavily cultivated and quite badly disturbed, and there were roads and everything else. But the base in the forest was completely intact, dark green, no evidence of disturbance.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s got to be a forest.\u201d\n\nI zoomed in more closely to the crater, the actual sides of the mountain, and I could see that they were this smooth granite. It was an inselberg. The sides were steep, smooth, fortress-like. And that\u2019s when the excitement came because if you can\u2019t get up there, then that forest is unique, extremely special, highly undisturbed, very rare. You\u2019re looking at a site where no humans have been before, or at least very few humans have been before.\n\nJonathan Timberlake (independent botanist): I looked at it on Google Earth and \u2026 realized that it was really quite a very, very unusual situation. The vegetation on the top was very thick. It was sort of a forest. You can never be absolutely sure whether something\u2019s forest or just dense woodland, but it looked very interesting.\n\nGATHERING THE TEAM\n\nAs a veteran expeditioner, Bayliss knew such an undertaking would require far more than Jeeps, tents, and willpower. The plan was to visit a uniquely undisturbed forest, and reaching it would involve a vertical climb of over 400 feet, the equivalent of two Leaning Towers of Pisa.\n\nHermenegildo Matimele (curator, National Herbarium of Mozambique): I met Julian 10 years ago on another expedition. We had teamed up together to explore Mount Mabu in 2008. Since then, we have been in touch. We have been collaborating, and we have been working together on a few other expeditions. I was really excited, and when he gave me the coordinates and I had a chance to see it from Google Earth, I was like, \u201cWow. What a treasure. Amazing.\u201d\n\nMike Brewin (logistician and community liaison): Julian had been talking about it for some time \u2014 fairly secretive[ly], you know, [because] you can\u2019t give the exact location or anything like that. But he let me know: \u201cLook, I found a new piece of forest that hasn\u2019t been visited. I\u2019m going to go there. I\u2019m going to assemble a dream team of scientists.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to assemble a dream team of scientists.\u201d\n\nSimon Willcock (lecturer in environmental geography, Bangor University): [Julian] sent me an email and asked if I could come. I was so excited. But you can\u2019t get too excited in academia because you apply for money, and you only get it about 1 in 10 times.\n\nBayliss: I knew I needed a climber, [and] I thought, \u201cWell, who\u2019s the best climber I know?\u201d It was quite obvious that Jules Lines is the best climber I know. I called up Lines, and then we started to look at the drone footage of the rock so he could assess the climbing elements.\n\nMatt Cooper (chef): I was in Africa back in 2009\u2026 working as a chef at a backpackers\u2019 [camp] in Lake Malawi. [Bayliss] was just visiting the area, and we got friendly. We got chatting, and he was telling me about his work on Mount Mabu. I just said to him one night, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ll come along with you one time.\u201d\n\nVanessa Muianga (marine biology intern, Natural History Museum of Maputo): I am an intern of the Natural History Museum on Mozambique. It\u2019s important when you do the expedition in Mozambique, you have to take [local scientists]. On the expedition, we have [four] Mozambicans.\n\nJeff Barbee (journalist and director of Alliance Earth): Very rarely do you get a chance to go on an expedition that\u2019s been individually curated to get the best people. Not just the people who are the best in their fields, but people who are collaborative and kind to one another, [who] help drive that sort of communal discovery excitement forward.\n\nBayliss: The team that I selected for this expedition was really the culmination of the last 30 years of my experience of running expeditions. The team I selected are the best in the world. They are the leaders in their scientific fields of expertise. They are the leaders and the best in terms of rock climbing. They are the leaders and the best in terms of running and putting together and organizing, supervising and doing all the logistics for expeditions of this size and this nature.\n\nPREPARING FOR LICO\n\nGetting ready to send 28 people from around the world to three sites (the top of Mount Lico, base camp, and Mount Socone) took an incredible amount of planning. Bringing in the experts \u2014 Mozambican scientists and organizers \u2014 was crucial in getting the project off the ground.\n\nRoland Van de Ven (expedition doctor, technical director at Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Tanzania): I had sleepless nights before I went. I check, double check, triple check \u2014 really checking if I have enough of everything. Then you start thinking about scenarios\u2026 because you never know what\u2019s going to happen. You don\u2019t know really who the people are, and you don\u2019t know their medical background. Maybe there are some people that have diseases that you are not aware of, maybe someone is diabetic. These things go into your mind.\n\nAra Monadjem (mammalogist, University of Swaziland): I had exactly two changes of clothes in my bag [for] a 10- or 12-day expedition. The rest was all my scientific equipment. I had a net to catch bats. I had bags to hold them in. I had various pieces of equipment to measure and weigh [animals] and so on.\n\n\u201cI had exactly two changes of clothes in my bag [for] a 10- or 12-day expedition.\u201d\n\nCooper: [Julian] didn\u2019t get enough funding for me to go. He just decided to pay for my ticket out of his back pocket. I really didn\u2019t have much time to organize before I went out.\n\nBayliss: [There are] a lot of similarities between what we do now and what, for example, the great explorers used to do 100 years ago, 150 years ago. We still use various modes of transports like airplanes, motorized vehicles, bicycles, and we walk on foot. And, generally, we take this sort of mode of transport to what you could say is the end of the road, which normally is a village or something like that. And then that\u2019s when mechanized forms of transport basically stop and you talk to the local chief. You organize porters and you organize guides, and then you go from the village, with the blessing of the local chief, to the forest or wherever you\u2019re going to be exploring.\n\nMonadjem: I live in Swaziland, so I [flew] to Johannesburg, and then from Johannesburg to Nampula. [Then] Julian put us into four-by-four vehicles, and we did a very long drive. I can\u2019t remember how many hours it was, but it felt like it was never going to end. Eventually, we arrived at the field site at the end of a terrible dirt road, maybe at nine o\u2019clock at night. I had been up since four that morning, only to be told that we have to walk another half an hour to get to our field site with all our bags.\n\nMuianga: It was many people, all spoke a different language [from me]. It was complicated to communicate and understand. It was so difficult because they talk very fast, and we don\u2019t understand anything in the first two days. But the next days, it was a little bit [better]. They are very kind people, make us feeling comfortable. And we make them feel comfortable because they have local people and they talk in our language and we have to translate.\n\nBrewin: I had to negotiate a lot of access, hiring porters and workers, that sort of thing. There is a lot of dealing with staff, a lot of driving people around from one site to the other or the airport. There\u2019s a lot of putting up tents, work constructing furniture out of twigs and sticks, lighting fires, and just general camp stuff.\n\nBarbee: The local people are the stewards of these environments, and so often we find in these places that the local people have been subsisting around these forests for a really long time. They have a very strong, vested interest in keeping them safe because they get firewood for one, but they also get medicine, and food, and sometimes even shelter. They use them as places to hide during times of conflict.\n\nNow, that being said, in a lot of these places, it is the local people who are now finally chopping them down [for valuable lumber]. They\u2019re often doing it with the help of foreign nationals from other countries, whether they\u2019re from Portugal or China or other countries. These people are paying folks to go in and chop these hardwood forests down for money.\n\n\u201cA guy came in with a puff adder on a stick.\u201d\n\nJoanna Osborne (botanist, Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew): We took a local guide with us, a very nice guy. He had a disability to one of his arms but still managed with the other to use a machete and help us to carry stuff. He took us around into this woodland, and we were asking about how much people used some of the species. And we found out some interesting information, like one of the tree\u2019s bark was used for making rice containers for harvesting. So, you see, this woodland was being used by local people.\n\nBrewin: There was a suspicion originally that we were there prospecting metals and minerals, that kind of thing. People started coming in with stones and stuff, saying, \u201cLook at this.\u201d We would say, \u201cNo, no. We\u2019re not interested in that.\u201d Then, eventually, they twigged that we were interested in biodiversity, flora, and fauna, and people started coming in with chameleons. A guy came in with a puff adder on a stick, that kind of thing.\n\nCLIMBING LICO\n\nMost scientific research doesn\u2019t require scaling 410 feet of sheer rock face.\n\nBarbee: People ask, \u201cWell, why wouldn\u2019t you guys just take a helicopter?\u201d Obviously they haven\u2019t seen the type of funding that science attracts these days. Helicopters are right out of the mix for most scientists around the world... The only way that we could get up there affordably and in the time allotted was that we would have to climb.\n\nJules Lines (expert climber): I\u2019ve worked in Singapore, [and in] Brazil. I\u2019ve worked all over the world being a safety supervisor for rope access work where we need to inspect oil rigs, or [go] underneath oil rigs. That\u2019s generally been my work for the last 25 years. Everything in my life is climbing-related.\n\n\u201cWell, why wouldn\u2019t you guys just take a helicopter?\u201d\n\nLast year, I went over to [Bayliss\u2019] house, and he wanted to show me some footage of [Lico] to see if it was possible or what was required of climbing the mountain. There [were] all these things going through [my] head. Is it going to be wet? Is it going to be raining all the time? And then, [secondarily], it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, how many dangerous creatures are up there? Am I going to get bitten by a snake, and am I going to die?\u201d\n\nMonadjem: When we walked out to the base of the cliff, that [was] the first time it struck me that this was going to be a serious climb. When we looked up, we couldn\u2019t even see the top of the cliff. That\u2019s how high it was.\n\nWhen I first got harnessed in, I started feeling quite apprehensive and wondering if I was going to make it to the top. It didn\u2019t look physically possible. It was very tough for me because for maybe up to halfway, I wasn\u2019t using the right technique. I was basically just pulling myself up with my arms. Then, at the halfway point, I realized that I didn\u2019t have the strength to go to the top. I had to learn how to use the equipment properly.\n\nMy hands were destroyed. For the entire trip, I had problems with my hands. I had two or three big blisters that burst on both hands.\n\nMatimele: I never used a rope to climb before. So it was so exciting. I only saw people using ropes to climb mountains in Cape Town, and I never had done that. So it was a little bit of pressure, when I was sort of halfway, when you look back and see how far you are. And you think like, \u201cWhat happens if this rope\u2014?\u2019\u2019 But, you know, it was okay. I didn\u2019t die.\n\n\u201cBut, you know, it was okay. I didn\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nBarbee: Every single person who attempted to go up made it. And that was a testament to the fact that [climbers] Mike Robertson and Julian Lines were so patient. I\u2019d watch them explain it and explain it again for hours. And if somebody really struggled getting up, then one of them would go up the second line. We had two lines coming down from the top. And then [the climbers] would literally coach them all the way up to the top in the most patient, kindest, most gentle way. I was gobsmacked.\n\nTimberlake: I just steeled myself that this was what I was going to do and just was determined to do it. and I think quite a few others are in a similar boat. You\u2019ve decided you\u2019re going to do it and you just do it. You don\u2019t think about it too much, and you just go and go and go. But it was very exhausting.\n\nBrewin: Julian Lines, the free climber, once the ropes were up, he could get up in 11 minutes, and he wouldn\u2019t use anything, you know, any of these fancy bits. He just went holding onto the ropes and [ran] up. He was absolutely incredible. And there\u2019s me doing about 35 or 40 [minutes], and other people who are taking an hour and a half or two hours. The two climbers were pretty much as close to superhuman as I\u2019ve seen.\n\nVIEW FROM THE TOP\n\nIt was a humbling experience for those who ascended the inselberg.\n\nBarbee: When I got up to the top, [the] first thing was I was incredibly out of breath. I was covered in sweat so badly that there was sweat dripping out the top of my boots. It\u2019s winter in Southern Africa, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cool. I was surrounded by butterflies, so many different kinds \u2014 some close, some small, some big, some... just so many butterflies. I just stood there surrounded by them, panting and realizing that I was getting into something very special. It had that feeling to it. That\u2019s not a very scientific term, but I can say that I\u2019ve been to many places, and the moment I entered that forest, I thought, \u201cWow. This is something very, very special.\u201d And it felt very old.\n\nLines: It\u2019s all a bit eerie, and you\u2019re looking around, and the first thing I noticed was it was just teeming with butterflies in the trees.\n\nBayliss: There were many emotions flooding [in]. It was an amazing sense of arrival. It was an amazing sense of adventure. It was an amazing sense of excitement. It was an amazing sense of wonder. And then walking through the forest, listening, looking, smelling, hearing, looking in wonder at the undergrowth, looking in wonder at the trees, seeing lots of small mammal tracks going across the ground, some of them very well-worn, which is very exciting because that means we\u2019ve got stuff up there, small mammals up there running around all over the place.\n\n\u201cIt was paradise... It was very, very, very different. It was very beautiful.\u201d\n\nWillcock: You had to wait for the adrenaline to die down before you could take in the mountaintop.\n\nAna Gledis da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (lab technician and mammalogist, Gorongosa National Park): It was paradise. It was like \u2014 wow \u2014 things that I saw on television. It was very, very, very different. It was very beautiful.\n\nMatimele: It\u2019s like you\u2019re flying. You can see down, you can see the vegetation patterns, you can see how the communities are arranged between the natural vegetation and the transformation of the habitat as a result of human activity.\n\nBrewin: You\u2019re on this kind of monolith, this big, granite boulder. You\u2019re looking out across the local area for miles and miles, and you see the extent of human interaction with the environment, the amount of deforestation that has gone on, the amount of planting of these eucalyptus plantations. And you know that 50, 60, 70 years ago, it would have just been pristine miombo woodland [a type of African forest]. There\u2019s sadness as well that you feel because you know it\u2019s changed. It\u2019s gone forever, and it will change more. And you know that you\u2019re standing on the last little remaining fragments of what was a kind of African paradise in a way. So yeah, [it was a] privilege but shrouded in a bit of regret and a bit of sadness for what was gone.\n\nLIFE IN CAMP\n\nOver two weeks, the team slept, ate, worked, and socialized in close quarters. On many expeditions, personality conflicts are common, but the Mount Lico team got along unusually well.\n\nBayliss: We had three camps on the go all the time. We had the satellite camp on Mount Lico, we had the satellite camp on Mount Socone, and then we had the base camp in between. The base camp was your hub where people were coming and going. And then teams would come in from Socone and go up Lico. The whole of the expedition, people were coming and going, moving in and moving out and moving through.\n\nOsborne: The mountain camps were much smaller and everyone was much busier because we had this really small window of time to do all your work. In the base camp, there were loads of jokes. It was really fun.\n\nMatimele: You all sit around the fire, and you have dinner, you tell stories, and you get to learn about each other\u2019s personality.\n\nBen Hayes (camp logistician): Each day [was] very different. You might be picking people up from the airport, which is [a] seven-hour drive. You might be just resupplying a bit on food. You might be dealing with local politics, different demands from village chiefs, or making sure all the local permits and that kind of thing are in place.\n\n\u201cI myself actually took in three bottles of whiskey, and I think they lasted four days.\u201d\n\nMonadjem: Some days, there would be bread but nothing to put in it. On other days, there would be slices of cheese but nothing to put the cheese on. Eventually, it all sorted out and we even had one relatively nice meal at the top that Julian made. I don\u2019t know how he managed. He boiled up some pasta and had some nice cheese that he grated on top of it. It turned out to be quite a delicious meal \u2014 or we were just so starving that it tasted good.\n\nColin Congdon (butterfly expert): The only thing that I deeply regret is [a local] brought a pig along, and we neglected to pass the hat around to raise enough money to buy it. That would have given the whole camp fresh meat, which we didn\u2019t have.\n\nCooper: People would eat [dinner] about 7 o\u2019clock or [6:30]. Then, we\u2019d all hang around the fire and have a whiskey and all head to our beds before probably before 10 o\u2019clock. A lot of people were in bed before 10. I did stay up a bit later, to be honest with you, because I had my fire and I slept right next to the kitchen area. Somebody would chat up and have a whiskey with me. I think that\u2019s just what the chef does, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCongdon: It was really great to have intelligent conversation evening after evening when everybody came in from the field. During the day, the camp was pretty much empty. But it was very convivial in the evening. I myself actually took in three bottles of whiskey, and I think they lasted four days.\n\nBarbee: There would be Colin Congdon, 84 years old, one of the greatest butterfly experts ever in Africa, sitting there excitedly giggling over butterflies, chatting to Vanessa Muianga from Mozambique, who\u2019s 27 years old and works with the Maputo Museum. It was a sort of round circle, looking at different samples of things, sharing and talking, leaning over each other\u2019s shoulders. Camp culture was very much a communal experience of discovery. It was like teenage boys showing each other their baseball cards.\n\nANIMAL LIFE IN AN UNDISTURBED FOREST\n\nAfter arrival, the scientists began their investigation of the fauna of Mount Lico and Mount Socone, which included a menagerie of small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, crabs, fish, (a few) birds, at least two antelope, and an army of butterflies. The team has already confirmed a new butterfly. And while data and DNA samples are still being processed, it is likely that they have encountered other previously undocumented species.\n\nBarbee: Very quickly, we realized that there were very few birds up there at all. So, it had a completely different sort of sound than most forests, where you wake up at four or five in the morning [to something] we call the dawn chorus: it literally sounds like something out of a Hollywood movie of the jungle with the sounds of all these crazy birds and things sounding off just before dawn. It did not have that. It was much more quiet. A still place. It felt like you kind of walked into a museum.\n\nMonadjem: I\u2019m an avid bird watcher, so I\u2019m always looking out for birds. I never saw a single bird in that entire five days. Not a single bird. That is, to me, quite amazing. There were one or two birds that were singing, and occasionally I\u2019d hear a bird calling, but I never saw a bird.\n\nThe lack of birds [was] maybe [because] the nestlings were being eaten by the ants. I don\u2019t know. It is just a guess.\n\nCooper: Frogs lived under the tents, and when we took them all down, we found loads of frogs.\n\nMonadjem: There was the giant rat, there were spiny mice, there were soft-furred mice that I caught quite commonly in the traps. There were several species of shrews that we caught in bucket traps, pitfall traps. I didn\u2019t have much luck with catching bats.\n\n\u201cHuh. I need to know what this poop is.\u201d\n\nda Concei\u00e7\u00e3o: On top of the mountain, I found some interesting poops. I didn\u2019t know what kind of poop it was. And can you believe that \u2014 beautiful poop. And I went, \u201cHuh. I need to know what this poop is.\u201d It was a beautiful poop of seeds and a little bit [of] beans. I collected a sample and showed it to Ara [Monadjem] at base camp, who told me it was a small species of rat.\n\nMonadjem: The giant rat, by the way, is a pretty interesting animal. It is the size of a cat with a very long tail. It looks just like a typical rat that [you] would see in any part of the world, but it is the size of a cat. It has a beautiful long tail.\n\nBayliss: Going through the camera traps and then actually seeing that one of them had actually caught a picture of the antelopes was a wild moment. I was like, \u201cOh, wow. Great. We got it. We needed this. We needed this picture. What is this antelope doing up here? How did he get up here? How long has it been up here?\u201d This is a mammal. This has been isolated for a long time. I\u2019ve collected fresh dung, and that\u2019s been sent to a lab for DNA analysis to determine if it\u2019s a new species or not.\n\nOsborne: Somebody found a catfish in the stream, and they managed to catch it as well, which seemed really bizarre, that a catfish had gone up there.\n\nBayliss: I got a new species of butterfly from Lico, which is lovely. And this butterfly will be named after the mountain.\n\nTHE SPIDERS\n\nA curious reality of life on Lico was that there were very few birds, but lots and lots of spiders \u2014 which meant lots of webs.\n\nWillcock: Lico was covered in caterpillars and absolutely covered in spiders as well\u2026 Almost every tree was connected to another tree by a spider\u2019s web. As you were walking forward, the first person got loads of spiders webs in their face.\n\nMonadjem: The only way to walk was to carry a stick vertically in front of you that would capture the spider webs as you walked. Every single step you took, you would take a spider web with you. I think this was probably an indication of the fact that there are no birds around. If there were birds there, they would have been eating those spiders.\n\n\u201cThe first person got loads of spiders webs in their face.\u201d\n\nWillcock: People would [develop] Matrix-like avoidance strategies. You know, where you\u2019re sort of leaning backward because you\u2019ve seen it just an inch before you hit it with your face.\n\nLines: Spiders don\u2019t really bother me so much. There were some big, furry caterpillars and a lot of them. I mean big \u2014 maybe three, four inches long. And someone said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t touch them because I think they\u2019re very poisonous or dangerous.\u201d\n\nTHE FOREST\n\nOnce on top, the researchers found that Lico had some unusual features.\n\nWillcock: We looked at above-ground carbon and below-ground carbon. For above-ground, we measure a plot that is 20 by 20 meters, and in that, every tree over 10 centimeters in diameter; there are seedlings and other small trees that aren\u2019t measured. There are equations then that help you calculate how much carbon is in each of those trees. That gives you the above-ground carbon. The really labor-intensive stuff was the soil pits we dug.\n\nInitially, we thought the soil would be quite shallow. If we got to a meter [a little over 3 feet], we thought we\u2019d be lucky because it\u2019s on top of a mountain, [and] mountain soils tend to be quite thin. I dug a hole that was probably about a meter by a meter, and I realized, \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t hit the bottom yet.\u201d [But] you can\u2019t go deeper than that because your entrance is too narrow. So I then had to widen the hole before I could go down again.\n\nAt one point, someone went, \u201cWhere is Simon?\u201d The hole was then bigger than me. They were really impressed because this hole is just getting deeper and deeper and deeper. But for us, it felt like it was taking an age. But at the same time, that was quite exciting. It shocked us. It probably means that the forest has been there a very, very long time. Soil does not accumulate quickly.\n\n\u201cAs long as you have food, you can live up there for quite a considerable time.\u201d\n\nMatimele: [At the top], you walk through some sort of woodland vegetation path with some Brachystegia [a type of tree that\u2019s common in Southern Africa]. Those are species with deep roots. They really, really need soil where they can deepen their roots in order to be stable. They [are] not a forest species.\n\nBrewin: There are all these tangly lianas, you know, vines and things like that \u2014 very deep leaf litter in the forest areas. And then there were these other areas, which are just exposed granite with [a] thin covering of lichen or grass, which, you know, were beautiful. They were a great spot for a picnic. You could just sit there on that and just look over it all. Obviously, there\u2019s fresh water up there. As long as you have food, you can live up there for quite a considerable time really because of the water situation and the firewood. There\u2019s plenty of firewood.\n\nTHE MYSTERY POTS\n\nOne of the first things spotted at the top of Lico was also the most mysterious: handmade pots. When the group visited the site, they asked the local people about the forest on top of the mountain. Had people ever gone up before? Some thought an earlier colonizing force from Germany had been to the top; others thought it was locals fleeing German forces who had climbed up. Due to conflicting information, combined with some local legends, it\u2019s still unclear who\u2019s been to the top and when.\n\nMatimele: We spoke to locals, and most of them didn\u2019t know that much about the area. They kept saying, \u201cNobody has ever been there.\u201d But I had [an] opportunity to interview some elderly local people. That\u2019s where I got to hear for the first time that there were Germans [during WWI]. The locals said [that] the only people they recall that had ever been there were Germans.\n\nBrewin: The story goes that [local] people died up there because the Germans cut the rope or pulled down the rope that they were using for getting up and down, so these guys couldn\u2019t get down again. Now, obviously, that was 100 years ago. It\u2019s a massive amount of leaf litter and all the rest of it up there. These people have turned into soil clearly, picked apart by birds and that sort of thing, so there\u2019s no traces of them at all other than these three pots that were found at the water source.\n\n\u201cThey talked of a tribe of little people who used to live on the top.\u201d\n\nWhether they were put there as some kind of prayer offering, I don\u2019t know. But they were clearly very old pots \u2014 handmade.\n\nTimberlake: My suggestion would be that it was a ceremonial purpose, that somebody had been up, possibly to do with rain, a rain type of ceremony. If you\u2019ve got a dry year in the surrounding area, you\u2019re liable to have severe problems of hunger. So appealing for rain is a very important function, and mountains are often associated, quite rightly, with rain.\n\nBayliss: The communities that I talked to said that they knew of nobody that had ever been up there in the community or their history. They talked of a tribe of little people who used to live on the top. And when they used to go to the base of the mountain, the little people used to throw snakes down on top of them. They talked about some personnel from the Portuguese Army, back in the colonial days, trying to climb Lico but they got halfway up, and then the tribe of little people cut the ropes, and they all fell down and died.\n\nThis isn\u2019t unique to this site. Even on Mount Mulanje in Southern Malawi, the people who live around the base of the mountain will talk about the Abatwa, the mythical little people who live on the top of the mountain.\n\nINJURIES AND RISKS\n\nOn any expedition, the possibility of getting hurt exists. Lico was no exception.\n\nVan de Ven: So, the thing is, you are in the tropics \u2014 so high temperature, high humidity, and you are in the bush. After one day, your clothes are already filthy with sweat and sand and grass, so it\u2019s not a clean environment. You sleep in tents. So keeping hygienic is really important, and cleaning wounds and covering wounds is really important because, within 24 hours a wound gets seriously infected, and you can turn septic.\n\nOsborne: We had one serious incident [in] which Jonathan [Timberlake], my colleague in botany, got an infection on his leg. We had to get him down the mountain really quickly.\n\nTimberlake: The day before, I was walking around the base, and I cut my leg on a piece of grass. It was quite a deep cut, and I did wash it and clean it, but obviously not enough. By that evening, it was obviously getting a little bit infected. By midday the next day, I could start feeling that it was really not good and my temperature was going up quite a lot. The decision was to move back to that camp and then to come down.\n\n\u201cHe was really hallucinating, had a fever of 40 degrees Celsius [104 degrees Fahrenheit] plus.\u201d\n\nLines: We had to strap him in, and he seemed to be okay going down. Mike [Brewin] went down with him by his side to make sure he was okay. And then we had to get him down through the jungle, which is probably harder because he was stumbling around down on the track, which he had macheted earlier on. It was lucky to get him down because I don\u2019t know what would have happened if we didn\u2019t get him down that night.\n\nVan de Ven: I treated him with antibiotics, cleaned out the wound, and observed him for 24 hours to see if I had to make a decision to take him to a hospital, which would be a four-hour drive from where we were. But luckily, he responded very well to the treatment. The moment he came down the mountain and it was already at the end of the day and dark, he was really hallucinating, had a fever of 40 degrees Celsius [104 degrees Fahrenheit] plus. But the good thing is, we were quick, and he was healthy enough to respond quickly.\n\nTimberlake: I was treated by the doctor in camp, who was quite concerned but [gave me] antibiotics. I did respond to them. But basically, I was confined to camp and had to have my leg up for the rest of the trip, which was very, very frustrating. But unfortunately, that\u2019s the way it turned out.\n\nLEAVING LICO\n\nAfter spending two weeks rotating between camps, it was time to pack up and head home.\n\nCongdon: I know the regrets. I have been to so many places in Africa that I know I\u2019ll never get back to, and I know there is so much now that I could do that I didn\u2019t know to do then. If I had my time again, with the youth I had then and the knowledge I have now, what it would be like! But, that is the story of mankind. We all feel that at times.\n\nBayliss: I was the last non-climber on the mountain, and I camped there the last night. Matt [Cooper], the cook, he went down [to Lico] because he had been basically on base camp the whole time cooking. You\u2019ve got to spend at least a night up on Lico. Just before the last day, I took him up the ropes and we camped. It was just me and Matt. The last working day, Matt went down the ropes, and then I walked around the mountain and brought in my butterfly traps and brought in my camera traps.\n\nIt was quite a moment because you\u2019re packing your fieldwork away now.\n\nI was bringing everything down, and I am meeting Jules [Lines] at the top of the ropes. And we gave ourselves a hug and looked out over the views, and then I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you down there then.\u201d And off I went.\n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EXPEDITION\n\nThe journey up Mount Lico meant different things to different members of the team. On a personal and scientific level, processing the findings of the unexplored forest will take months, if not years.\n\nda Concei\u00e7\u00e3o: I [am] the first Mozambican woman [who] will climb this mountain. And it will be good for the other women, Mozambican women \u2014 encourage other women to do things.\n\nWillcock: On Lico, you are almost entirely certain if there is a change of any kind of vegetation or anything like that, it\u2019s due to climate. So how Lico has reacted to past climatic changes will give us a good proxy of how the forest will react to future climatic changes. And that\u2019s a very rare type of site that can do that without the confounding factor of human disturbance.\n\nda Concei\u00e7\u00e3o: [This trip] made me more confident \u2014 more confident and more brave.\n\n\u201cI am the first Mozambican woman who will climb this mountain.\u201d\n\nLines: I haven\u2019t done anything like this before and probably never [will do] anything like this again.\n\nOsborne: Hopefully, we can just leave it alone and go and look at it every so often, monitor what\u2019s happening up there. Let\u2019s see what happens in a place which is relatively undisturbed.\n\nMatimele: As we go, we get to know more and broaden our picture about what\u2019s happening within [the] province. We got to record, document, and be able to provide good advice to the government, [like] what direction should be taken in order to ensure a standard of living for Mozambicans, but also make sure that biodiversity, flora, and fauna remain part of these places.\n\nBayliss: Look what\u2019s happening in Indonesia, Malaysia, a lot in the Congo, maybe even West Africa as well, where you have vast, huge areas of lowland, medium-altitude rainforests. It\u2019s all getting clear felled for commercial interests such as palm oil\u2026 It\u2019s probably the greatest environmental crime of humanity right now, this destruction of remaining rainforests, especially when they actually clean the air that we breathe and balance and govern the whole global atmosphere. What happens in Malaysia or the Amazon or the Congo will also affect the quality of air that you breathe in New York or London or Wales. It\u2019s very shortsighted that we\u2019re clearing all of this rainforest so quickly at such a devastating and large scale.\n\nWillcock: It was a privilege to go to a site like that. Not many people get to do it. It\u2019s a similar number that walked on top of Lico than have walked on the Moon.\n\nFunding for photography provided in part by Alliance Earth.\n\nCorrection August 28th, 8:40AM ET: The article previously misstated how long Bayliss had been using Google Earth for his research.", "description": "The story of the Mount Lico expedition began six years ago when Dr. Julian Bayliss, a conservation scientist and butterfly expert, spied a small forest atop a mountain using Google Earth.
