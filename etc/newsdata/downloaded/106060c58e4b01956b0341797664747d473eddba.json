Rather, the government would have the burden to establish such surrogacy by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d\n\nWilkins also said legal precedents require that the family members approach Jackson first for relief, unless it would be \u201cfutile\u201d for them to do so.\n\n\u201cStone\u2019s family members give us no reason to believe that the District Court would not fairly consider their objections,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWilkins said Stone\u2019s family members could still go to Jackson with their objections to the gag order, then appeal if unsatisfied with her ruling. The D.C. Circuit decision did not explicitly say if Stone could obtain review in the same fashion.\n\nLawyers for Stone and his family did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision.\n\nStone\u2019s trial is set to begin Nov. 5.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ea/a6/b8d5c1494da09a0a4f95be51e6ea/191022-roger-stone-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
