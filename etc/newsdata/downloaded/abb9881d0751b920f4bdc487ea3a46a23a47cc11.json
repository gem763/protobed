(Carlos Osorio/AP)\n\nThe Flint water crisis may be best recognized for reigniting concerns about the levels of lead in municipal drinking water, but it\u2019s less often associated with a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease \u2014 a severe form of pneumonia caused by waterborne bacteria that can be lethal if left untreated.\n\n\u201cFlint\u2019s Deadly Water,\u201d the new PBS Frontline investigation that first aired Tuesday, lays out a devastating case for why the extent of Flint\u2019s 2014 Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak \u2014 and the attending death toll \u2014 may be far worse than previously reported.\n\nFor years, state health officials in Michigan have set the official death toll for the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak amid the Flint water crisis at 12 people. But during the roughly year-and-a-half the outbreak spanned, Frontline reporters found that 115 people in Flint died of non-viral pneumonia.\n\n[This is how toxic Flint\u2019s water really is]\n\nThe stark difference in numbers, along with evidence culled from court records, internal emails among state government officials, interviews with victims and data analysis, suggests there were dozens of deaths that stemmed from undiagnosed and untreated cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease that ultimately fell outside the state\u2019s official count (which, per standard public health reporting methods, only counts people diagnosed with Legionnaires\u2019 who either died in the hospital or within a month of leaving it).\n\n\u201cLegionnaires\u2019 manifests as a type of pneumonia, and if you walk into the physician\u2019s office with pneumonia, they may just give you a round of antibiotics. And if they don\u2019t know about the outbreak, they won\u2019t usually test for it,\u201d said Dr. Kristin Nelson, a researcher with Emory University who was among a team of experts commissioned by Frontline to analyze their reporting.\n\nNelson said physicians often won\u2019t suspect Legionnaires\u2019 as the cause behind a case of severe pneumonia and thinks it may be the reason there was a significant discrepancy between the likely number of Legionnaires\u2019 deaths her team found and the number of deaths the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has reported.\n\nTo test the theory in Frontline\u2019s findings, Nelson, along with epidemiologists Zach Binney and Allison Chamberlain, charted six years worth of non-viral pneumonia deaths using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data to compare Genesee County, which encompasses Flint, and four control cities in neighboring states that have similar size and climate as Flint.\n\nThroughout the six-year span, non-viral pneumonia deaths in both Genesee County and the control areas followed seasonal trends: rising in winter months and dropping in summer ones. But in the summer of 2014, when the MDHHS first tracked the start of Flint\u2019s Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak, pneumonia death rates jumped in Genesee, while falling \u2014 per the seasonal trend \u2014 in the control areas.\n\n\u201cWe found 70 more pneumonia deaths in Genesee County than normal, based on what was going on in control counties at the time,\u201d Binney said in an interview. \u201cYou see pneumonia mortality in Genesee maintain or rise and you see it drop in the control counties. We\u2019re not saying all 70 of these deaths are Legionnaires\u2019 deaths \u2014 only that [data] is consistent with the idea that there was a substantially larger outbreak than reported.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the pneumonia deaths correspond with the nearly 90 cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease the MDHHS tracked during the year-and-a-half-long outbreak.\n\n[In Flint, Mich., there\u2019s so much lead in children\u2019s blood that a state of emergency is declared]\n\nThough independent researchers determined the MDHHS likely undercounted at least 70 Legionnaires\u2019 deaths during Flint\u2019s water crisis, Binney clarified that the team doesn\u2019t have reason to suspect the undercount was intentional:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t consider it likely that there were known cases that weren\u2019t reported. We don\u2019t know, and we\u2019re just speculating, but based on our experience, someone simply doesn\u2019t get tested for Legionnaires [so] they don\u2019t get included in the case count.\u201d\n\nBinney, who praised the thoroughness of Frontline\u2019s reporting, was careful to note that his team\u2019s job was limited to testing if Frontline\u2019s theory that Legionnaires\u2019 deaths could be significantly undercounted could be substantiated (it could); their analysis does not address the 115 records with pneumonia listed as cause of death or the actual source of the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak. In fact, the source of the outbreak remains in dispute: A peer-reviewed report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by a team of state-commissioned researchers concluded that 80 percent of local Legionnaires\u2019 cases could be attributed to changing the water supply source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in 2014. The MDHHS disputed the report\u2019s findings as \u201cincomplete\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consensus in the Legionnaires\u2019 community is that it\u2019s pretty badly underdiagnosed, so it would not be surprising to find it during an outbreak, especially if communication [from public health officials] isn\u2019t strong,\u201d Binney said.\n\nWhile neither Frontline nor the independent analysis found an intentional coverup of Legionnaires\u2019 deaths, the investigation presents ample evidence that county and state health officials mismanaged the response to the outbreak. Michigan health officials declined to give Frontline on-camera interviews, but a spokesperson for the department said the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak couldn\u2019t be definitively connected to water, because the water was never tested.\n\n[\u2018I let you down.\u2019 Michigan governor apologizes for Flint water crisis, says he\u2019ll release emails]\n\nWhile county and state health departments tracked the spike in Legionnaires\u2019 cases throughout 2014 and into 2015, the public \u2014 including many in the health-care community \u2014 weren\u2019t notified of the outbreak for approximately 18 more months, well after the outbreak\u2019s peak. Health researchers testified that they were blocked by state officials from testing water samples, and water filters in homes, and the state disputed a report into the water crisis, insisting the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak was linked to the McLaren hospital in Flint, not the city\u2019s water supply.\n\nTodd Flood, the special counsel appointed to investigate the Flint water crisis, had particularly strong criticism for Nick Lyon, the former director for MDHHS.\n\n\u201cThough he\u2019s presumed innocent, we\u2019re saying he had a duty to tell the people. He failed to do that duty,\u201d Flood said in the documentary. \u201cHe then kept things under wraps, the spike was continuing to go up, and sure enough, in the summer of 2015, multiple people got sick, and multiple people died.\u201d\n\nLyon\u2019s attorney denied to Frontline that MDHHS blocked the scientists\u2019 requests to test water and said Lyon was simply trying to ensure the state was funding \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d research.\n\nLyon and seven other state officials faced criminal charges, including involuntary manslaughter, related to the crisis, before all charges were dropped this summer.\n\nRead more:\n\nMarc Edwards helped expose dangerous amounts of lead in the water in Flint and D.C.
