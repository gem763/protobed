That represents a slight increase from the 23.2 percent annual growth it previously reported for the first six months of the year.\n\nAD\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company said its profit margin grew by 8.7 percent compared to the first nine months of last year.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s numbers are not audited or complete \u2014 it is not a publicly listed company, so it is not required to divulge its financials at all \u2014 and it did not give numbers for just the third quarter. Instead, it rolled them in with the numbers from the first half of the year, making it difficult to discern trends.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nThe company, founded in 1987 by former People\u2019s Liberation Army engineer Ren Zhengfei, has grown into a corporate behemoth that exemplifies the Communist Party\u2019s vision for the country\u2019s future: advanced high tech and entirely Chinese.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s emergence has been met with growing suspicions about its links to the Communist Party and whether the firm might be acting on the party\u2019s behalf.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to shut Huawei out of the U.S. telecommunications market and to convince other governments around the world to do the same.\n\nHuawei\u2019s latest statement offered a riposte to that campaign. \u201cIn the carrier business, commercial deployment of 5G networks around the world has sped up,\u201d the company statement said.\n\nAD\n\nIt said it has signed more than 60 commercial contracts for 5G and shipped more than 400,000 of the base stations used to transmit it. This represented a significant jump from July, when the company reported having secured 50 commercial 5G contracts and shipped just 150,000 antenna units.\n\nMore than half the 5G contracts are in Europe, and just this week, the German government said it would not exclude any equipment makers from its 5G networks.\n\nThe third quarter is the first full quarter since President Trump signed an executive order in May essentially prohibiting U.S. companies from buying telecom equipment from Huawei.\n\nIt also placed Huawei and 70 of its affiliates on a blacklist, banning them from buying parts and components from American companies without U.S. government approval. However, it has granted two reprieves to allow limited sales to continue until Nov. 19.\n\n\n\nHuawei has been stockpiling American parts and funding other supply chains. In August, it unveiled its own operating system, HarmonyOS, which it plans to put in its smartphones if it loses the ability to use Google\u2019s Android system.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRen, the company founder, has said he expects these efforts to shave about $10 billion off annual revenue, although there is little sign that has begun.\n\nHuawei, the second-largest smartphone maker in the world since it overtook Apple earlier this year, said it shipped more than 185 million smartphones in the first nine months of this year. This suggested that its shipments were largely steady. In July, the company reported it had shipped 118 million phones in the first six months of the year.\n\nOverall, Huawei has sent out 26 percent more handsets so far this year than in the first nine months of last year.\n\n\u201cIn the consumer business, Huawei's smartphone business has grown steadily,\u201d it said. \u201cThe company also saw rapid growth in other new businesses like PCs, tablets, wearables, and smart audio products.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeparately, Ren\u2019s daughter and Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is fighting extradition from Canada to the United States, where she is wanted for allegedly breaching American sanctions against trading with Iran. She has been under house arrest in Vancouver since December last year.\n\nExtradition proceedings against her are due to start in January and are expected to take the better part of a year.\n\nAD", "description": "The Chinese tech company said revenue has increased sharply this year.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qovPUWr9JBb4Uu38FqTj_wxQfZc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5H7BWEHP7QI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
