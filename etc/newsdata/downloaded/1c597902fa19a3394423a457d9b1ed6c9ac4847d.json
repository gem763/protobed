General Assembly session, Britain, France and Germany joined the United States on Monday in blaming Iran for the Sept. 14 attacks on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe leaders of the U.K., France and Germany \u2014 those nations, unlike the U.S. remain parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal \u2014 said in a statement that \u201cthere is no other plausible explanation\u201d than that \u201cIran bears responsibility for this attack.\u201d\n\nThe joint statement began: \u201cWe, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, recall our shared common security interests, in particular upholding the global non-proliferation regime and preserving stability in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIt concluded: \u201cWe are committed to continuing our diplomatic efforts to create conditions and facilitate dialogue with all relevant partners interested in de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East, in the interest of preserving international peace and security. \u2026 We urge Iran to engage in such a dialogue and refrain from further provocation and escalation.\u201d\n\nTRUMP, IN WAKE OF SAUDI OIL ATTACK, SAYS 'I DON'T WANT WAR WITH ANYBODY'\n\nInternational experts continue, at Saudi Arabia\u2019s request, to investigate what happened and who was responsible.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, denied any part in the attacks. He said Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who claimed responsibility, \u201chave every reason to retaliate\u201d for the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s aerial attacks on their country.\n\nHe also stressed that on the eve of President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s visit to the United Nations \u2014 which sits in the middle of New York City \u2014 \u201cit would be stupid for Iran to engage in such activity.\u201d\n\nZarif, however, ruled out any Iran-U.S. meeting. He said Iran had received no request from the U.S., \u201cand we have made clear that a request alone will not do the job.\u201d\n\nHe said Trump \u201cclosed the door to negotiations\u201d with the latest U.S. sanctions, which labeled the country\u2019s central bank a \u201cglobal terrorist\u201d institution \u2014 a designation the Iranian minister said the U.S. president and his successors may not be able to change.\n\n\u201cI know that President Trump did not want to do that. I know he must have been misinformed,\u201d said Zarif, meeting with U.N. correspondents Monday.\n\nZarif said he plans to meet Wednesday with ministers of the five countries remaining in the 2015 nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew \u2014 Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany.\n\nShortly before leaving for the U.N. meetings Monday, Iran\u2019s Rouhani said on state television that his country will invite Persian Gulf nations to join an Iranian-led coalition \u201cto guarantee the region\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nRouhani said the plan is not limited to security but also encompasses economic cooperation and an initiative for \u201clong-term\u201d peace. He planned on presenting details while at the United Nations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIran\u2019s president had already called on Western powers Sunday to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to regional nations led by Tehran.\n\nZarif said the new Hormuz Peace Initiative \u2014 with the acronym HOPE \u2014 would be formed under a U.N. umbrella with two underlying principles: nonaggression and noninterference. He said it would require a major shift from countries \u201cbuying\u201d security from other nations or mercenaries, and promote the notion that \u201cyou can gain security relying on your own people and working with your neighbors.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Britain, France and Germany joined the United States on Monday in blaming Iran for attacks on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, but the Iranian foreign minister pointed to claims of responsibility by Yemeni rebels and said: \u201cIf Iran were behind this attack, nothing would have been left of this refinery.\u201d", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
