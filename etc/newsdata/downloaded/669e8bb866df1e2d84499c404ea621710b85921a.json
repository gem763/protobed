It allows companies to be more innovative by taking more calculated risks.\n\nHarris Farm director Catherine Harris says directors need time to \"shoot the breeze\". Supplied\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between putting in a business strategy that doesn\u2019t work and a business strategy that is irresponsible,\u201d Harris says. \u201c[In public companies, many] people don\u2019t distinguish between bad business practices and taking a risk.\n\n\u201cTherein lies the problem. Maybe that is where the lack of innovation comes from. People are not prepared to take the risk. We need more entrepreneurialism.\u201d\n\nHaving board members who have been a company boss also helps, she says. In public companies, there is often a lack of directors who have had to \u201csweat the payroll\u201d.\n\nAnother lesson is creating an environment where directors feel free to put forward ideas that might be considered outside the box.\n\n\u201cSitting around corporate boards are people who usually come together from different industries,\u201d Harris says. \u201cThey don't necessarily know each other very well. There is not the bravery to throw around ideas that are out there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirectors, says Harris, also need time to \u201cshoot the breeze\u201d. This is often more difficult in public companies where there is more pressure to stick to the meeting agenda.\n\nHarris and Morphet say private company boards tend to be closer to management, including those who operate a couple of rungs below the CEO. \u201cIn private equity, directors are more in sync with the management of the company. You get to see the talent closer,\u201d Morphet says. \u201cYou can move more quickly if they are no good.\u201d\n\nSome experts argue that one of the key problems facing directors of public companies is that they don\u2019t understand their goal. Private equity-backed company directors know they need to make money for shareholders. Not-for-profit and profit-for-member organisations, such as super funds, also have a clear core purpose.\n\nStakeholder focus\n\nInvestment banker and venture capitalist Mark Carnegie argues that public company directors don't have a clear goal. Too often, they get waylaid by governance issues.\n\nHe is also highly sceptical of the latest talk of directors acting in the interests of all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cPeople use \u2018other stakeholders\u2019 as a phrase to cover themselves for meetings spent on meaningless issues,\u201d Carnegie says. \u201cWhere boards go wrong is exactly because people use a phrase like that. You can\u2019t make it mean anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you want to put the environment first, say so. If you want to pay employees more, say so. If you think the management will trade the long term for the short term, then focus on that. There are heaps of things wrong with a relentless focus on profit, but using a phrase like \u2018other stakeholders\u2019 makes things worse, not better.\u201d\n\nTraill, who also sits on the board of Carnegie\u2019s investment company MH Carnegie & Co, says people with strong strategic brains can be brought on as advisers and attend some, if not all, board meetings. This happens often in super funds.\n\nAt Sunsuper, former Vanguard Investments chief investment officer Gus Sauter acts as an adviser to the investment committee.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that compliance burden means boards are overweight with people from accounting backgrounds and not offering strategic advice,\u201d Traill says. \u201c[Appointing external advisers] gives you the opportunity to have people who advise on key strategic issues who don\u2019t get tied up in the obligatory compliance side. We frequently ask advisers to board meetings.\u201d\n\nTraill and Carngie agree that requiring directors to have an economic interest in the company can improve their level of engagement. \u201cMy personal bias is that it\u2019s a healthy thing,\u201d Traill says.\n\nMorphet says she would not make it mandatory for directors on company boards to own shares, but she says that in the private equity world it helps keep board members\u2019 minds fixed on the job.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows what is going on all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nCarnegie also argues that directors of publicly listed companies would do well to question their motives. Too often, he argues, directors are attracted by status.\n\nHarris notes that family company boards have greater empathy for staff, and employees tend to work harder in return. In a listed company, she says, there is not that emotional contact.", "description": "Private businesses have a lot to teach public companies about creating an environment where directors can suggest unorthodox ideas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3381%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_544%2C$y_9/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5c9efd87882e33c0ff171446be402f16f566f428", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
