(CNW Group/Tim Hortons)\n\nWhile restaurant chains across North America are jumping on the plant-based meat alternative craze, Tim Hortons is taking a step back.\n\nThe coffee and doughnut chain confirmed Wednesday that it will be pulling the Beyond Meat Burger and Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches from locations in all provinces except Ontario and British Columbia.\n\nShares of Beyond Meat (BYND) closed on Wednesday down nearly 4 per cent at $153.99.\n\nA spokesperson for Tim Hortons said the Beyond Meat items, which were introduced just three months ago, were a limited time offer and will be available across the country while supplies last.\n\n\u201cWe have particularly seen positive reaction to our Beyond Meat offering in Ontario and B.C., especially in breakfast, and are proud to offer both alternatives in those regions,\u201d the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cLike any limited time offer, we may explore offering the product again in other provinces at a future date based on ongoing guest feedback.\u201d\n\nTim Hortons added two Beyond Meat Burgers \u2013 both selling for $5.69 \u2013 to its lunch menu in July, one month after launching three types of Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches.\n\nThe decision to remove the plant-based offerings from locations in most Canadian provinces comes at a time when food retailers are eagerly jumping on the plant-based protein bandwagon.\n\nSubway announced last month that it will be testing Beyond Meatball Marinara subs at 685 locations in Canada and the U.S. KFC is also testing a \u201cBeyond Fried Chicken\u201d item at a location in Atlanta.\n\nStill, it appears Beyond Meat is not for everyone.\n\nTim Hortons, which is owned by parent company Restaurant Brands International (QSR), has been tweaking its menu over the last several months as part of an effort to increase brand excitement and traffic at franchises across the chain.\n\nRBI chief executive Jose Cil said in the company\u2019s quarterly conference call in August that the company has been rethinking how to use product to drive sales at Tim Hortons.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the Beyond Meat Burger as a kind of limited time offer to see how it would react and we\u2019re encouraged by some of the behaviour there,\u201d Cil said.\n\n\u201cBut in the end, we\u2019re really a coffee and baked goods business with very strong sandwich offerings with soup and other products that are natural to our restaurants.\u201d\n\nYahoo Finance Canada More\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "description": "The Canadian coffee and doughnut chain confirmed Wednesday that it will be pulling the Beyond Meat Burger and Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches from its menus in all provinces except Ontario and British Columbia.", "authors": ["Alicja Siekierska"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4IrmIN_XfuTrupd6RGLQ0Q--~B/aD03ODU7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-07/dd4f5a70-a8ab-11e9-bfe5-eb73b7ec5a50", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
