There are 7.7 billion people on Earth, as of an October 2019 estimate by the United Nations. And yet, Facebook is not even the first app to reach five billion app installs on Android.\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\nIn case you were wondering, Google apps like Maps, YouTube, and Play Services were the first to hit that milestone, given that they come preloaded on the Android platform. But this is still impressive given that Facebook has managed that feat independently, without being preloaded for most users.\n\nThe five billion installs come almost exactly five years after Facebook passed a billion. It was at the time also the first non-Google app to hit that number as well. And it's not too surprising when you think about it.\n\nFacebook was one of the first few social networks that really took off. Rising up in the wake of the likes of MySpace, Hi5, and Orkut, it changed the system, offering people a News Feed instead of just visiting other profiles, as well as add-ons like quizzes and games.\n\nDon't Miss 1.4 K SHARES 246 SHARES 1 K SHARES 145 SHARES\n\nAnd despite the data privacy issues with it, many people now coming online for the first time are still making their first stop at Facebook. And it helps the company has also made deals with the likes of Samsung, LG, and Xiaomi, to have its app preinstalled on their devices.\n\nJust in February this year, Facebook actually saw its daily userbase growing 9 percent to 1.52 billion. This was especially thanks to growth in places like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where Internet penetration is improving and people are coming online for the first time.\n\nAnd at least for many of the older generations, there's no denying that they've gotten so deep into Facebook it's impossible to switch to another platform. Let the kids have their Instagram, and Snapchat, and TikTok, a simple Facebook feed is all many people need.", "description": "Five billion is a huge number, just to think about it objectively.
