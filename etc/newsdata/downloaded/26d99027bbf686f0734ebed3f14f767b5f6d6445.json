It will drive a multitude of people into a gray area without papers and proper documentation,\" said a joint statement from six human rights groups including the Greek offices of Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders.\n\nOn Tuesday, some 700 refugees and migrants arrived from the island of Samos at the port of Elefsina, west of Athens, and were to be taken to mainland camps.\n\nBut authorities on Samos said that didn't ease the pressure enough. They said another 200 arrivals had been recorded Monday and organized a protest to demand more decisive government action.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nGatopoulos reported from Athens.
