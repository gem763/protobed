It also calls on Democrats to dismantle the process they set up to impeach Trump over allegations that he abused his power by pressuring Ukrainian leaders to help discredit his political rivals.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s latest assault on House Democrats\u2019 myriad investigations sets up yet another constitutional clash between the executive and legislative branches \u2014 one with far-reaching implications over the powers of the presidency and of Congress.\n\n\u201cAll of this violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent. Never before in our history has the House of Representatives \u2014 under the control of either political party \u2014 taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue,\u201d Cipollone added.\n\nIn particular, Cipollone took issue with the fact that the House has not formally voted to authorize the establishment of an impeachment inquiry, calling it a violation of due process.\n\n\u201cIn the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCipollone also echoed Republicans\u2019 criticisms of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), whose staff had previous contact with the whistleblower who first sounded the alarm about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cAnyone who was involved in the preparation or submission of the whistleblower's complaint cannot possibly act as a fair and impartial judge in the same matter - particularly after misleading the American people about his involvement,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/1769/1155968404_6093168535001_6093165840001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nThe White House\u2019s argument may already be in legal trouble. The chief judge of Washington's federal district court indicated earlier Tuesday in a related proceeding that she gives great \u201cdeference\u201d to the House\u2019s authority to devise its own impeachment procedures.\n\nThe judge, Beryl Howell, repeatedly challenged the Trump administration\u2019s view that a formal vote is necessary to declare an impeachment inquiry \u2014 though she conceded it would be a more clear-cut call if a vote occurred. Howell is expected to rule later this month on whether the House\u2019s impeachment probe is legitimate and warrants the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s grand jury materials to Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s GOP allies on Capitol Hill have pushed Pelosi to hold a vote, but she has maintained that such a vote is unnecessary because it is not outlined as a requirement in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cNo court and certainly no executive branch agency has the constitutional power to tell the legislative branch it is or is not formally in an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a senior member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in an interview. \u201cIf we say that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe document includes few defenses of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky, which is at the heart of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. While Cipollone wrote that \u201cthe call was completely appropriate,\u201d his letter focuses mostly on the impeachment process itself.\n\nThe White House\u2019s memo comes just hours after the State Department intervened to block Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from testifying before the three House committees that are leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats, including Schiff, have indicated that outright stonewalling from the White House could compel Democrats to move forward with articles impeachment based on obstruction of their investigation.\n\n\u201cThey say: they will not cooperate with an impeachment inquiry unless it\u2019s on their terms. They mean: the president is above the law,\u201d Schiff wrote on Twitter shortly after Cipollone\u2019s letter was released. \u201cThe Constitution says otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s posture toward House Democrats\u2019 investigations as outlined on Tuesday is not new; earlier this year, Trump declared that he would ignore all congressional subpoenas, and his administration has subsequently ignored several subpoenas, refusing to provide documents while blocking witnesses from testifying.\n\n\u201cThis is really nothing but a political strategy because Democrats want to overturn the results of the 2016 election, and they want to use impeachment and the political strategy to influence the results of the 2020 election,\u201d said a senior administration official.\n\nThe White House is hoping to bring into the fold Trey Gowdy, a former South Carolina GOP congressman and chair of the House Oversight Committee who was at the White House on Tuesday, where he met with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and others about potentially joining Trump\u2019s legal team as an outside adviser. Gowdy did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nCipollone has also argued that the House should, in keeping with previous impeachment efforts, authorize the Republican minority to subpoena witnesses, as well as allow witnesses enough time to prepare for depositions. He accused Democrats of threatening witnesses by suggesting their refusal to appear promptly would be treated as evidence of \u201cobstruction.\u201d\n\nThe White House letter did not indicate that Trump intends to invoke executive privilege to block the House\u2019s access to witnesses or documents. Cipollone indicated that the White House would be open to working with Democrats if they shelved their impeachment push and instead focused on the \u201cregular order of oversight requests.\u201d\n\nTrump invoked executive privilege in May to block Congress from accessing elements of Mueller\u2019s report on the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia in 2016. He did it again in June, when Congress was seeking documents and testimony about the administration\u2019s handling of the 2020 Census.\n\nBut more often, witnesses and White House officials have muzzled themselves, claiming that they can\u2019t reveal details of their conversations and interactions with Trump because of the potential they could breach his right to confidentiality. Democrats have rejected this claim as an inappropriate expansion of executive privilege.\n\nThe White House has also claimed that former senior advisers to the president have \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from testifying to Congress \u2014 an even more sweeping effort to block cooperation.\n\nHeather Caygle and Nancy Cook contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dd/4f/d96bb9b24bf19c9ab06ae9fe1f4f/20191008-nancy-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
