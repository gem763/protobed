A new lawsuit alleging rape has some sports watchers speculating about the possibility of a departure from yet another NFL team. But even if that came to pass, the New England Patriots wide receiver would still likely be $9 million richer -- even if he didn't play one game for his new team.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn a civil lawsuit filed on Monday afternoon, Brown\u2019s former trainer Britney Taylor alleges that he sexually assaulted and later raped her. The Patriots said Tuesday that the NFL planned to do its own investigation of the accusations against Brown.\n\nThe Patriots signed Brown this past weekend, scooping up the troubled star athlete after he had just been released by the Oakland Raiders. Were the Patriots to decide that the distraction that is Brown outweighs his Pro Bowl talent and waive the player, Brown is still likely pocketing a lot of money.\n\nAndrew Brandt, a former executive with the Green Bay Packers and the Philadelphia Eagles, tweeted on Wednesday morning that Brown is owed $5 million of a bonus within two weeks of his signing with the Patriots. He is then owed another $4 million in January.\n\n\u201cThe Patriots could try to withhold payment on the signing bonus, pending league investigation, knowing they will have a tough time getting money back once paid,\u201d Brandt tweeted. \u201cBrown could file a grievance over that, however, and likely win.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown was released over this past weekend by the Raiders, following a tumultuous several months with the team. Acquired by the Raiders in an offseason trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers (where he had burned bridges with the organization), Brown\u2019s time in the \"Silver & Black\" was marred by constant drama and an alleged physical altercation with general manager Mike Mayock.\n\nThe league will now decide whether to place Brown on paid leave (which would mean he cannot practice or play in games) via the commissioner\u2019s exempt list pending the investigation, or allow him to play. The Patriots, known for running a tight ship, could also act preemptively and simply release the player. That pathway seems less likely, however, as the financial hit would be devastating.\n\nBarring any new revelations \u2013 and it seems like every day there is another twist and turn to Brown\u2019s season so far \u2013 the wide receiver is likely to get the bonus money owed to him by the Patriots. It is a point backed up by salary cap expert Jason Fitzgerald. The noted salary cap expert and founder of OverTheCap.com underscored Brandt\u2019s tweets on the matter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Will Antonio Brown be on the move again?\u00a0A new\u00a0lawsuit alleging rape has some sports watchers speculating about the possibility of a departure\u00a0from yet another NFL team.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/Antonio-Brown.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
