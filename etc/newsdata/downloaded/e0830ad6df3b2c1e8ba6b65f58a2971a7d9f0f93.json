Morey deleted the tweet shortly afterwards and the NBA and the Rockets distanced themselves from his statement. The NBA said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that the tweet had caused offence in China, and the Rockets said Morey\u2019s views did not represent those of the team.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s statement is jarring to some, given the fact that the league has won plaudits for encouraging its players to express their views on social issues they believe are important. Texas senator Ted Cruz, who is a Rockets fan, condemned the NBA\u2019s stance on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nNBA scrambles after China angered by Houston Rockets' 'regrettable' pro-democracy tweet Read more\n\nJulian Castro, a Democratic presidential candidate, expressed similar views. \u201cChina is using its economic power to silence critics \u2013 even those in the US,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) China is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. https://t.co/87U4jgsAAp\n\nOn Monday the NBA\u2019s commissioner, Adam Silver insisted the league supported free speech.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,\u201d Silver told Kyodo News in Tokyo, where the Rockets are due to play this week. \u201cThere have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have. I think as a values-based organisation that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nThere has been a widespread backlash to Morey\u2019s tweet in China. The country\u2019s basketball association is headed by former Rockets star Yao Ming and described Morey\u2019s tweet as \u201cimproper remarks regarding Hong Kong\u201d. Chinese state television and media company Tencent, which has a $1.5bn deal to televise the NBA in China over the next five years, have said they will cut ties with the Rockets. The Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, People\u2019s Daily, wrote that Morey\u2019s comments were \u201churtful to Chinese basketball fans and is also an affront to the Chinese people.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to see why the Rockets and the NBA are eager to avoid alienating fans in China. The league has been growing its fanbase in China successfully for three decades, and many players have lucrative sponsorship deals in the country. The Rockets in particular have a strong following in China due to Ming, one of his country\u2019s most popular ever athletes.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d the league\u2019s chief communications officer, Mike Bass, said on Sunday.\n\nLeBron James, the league\u2019s biggest and most marketable star, is in China this week, where he will play for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets owner is Joe Tsai, a co-founder of the Chinese retail giant Alibaba. Tsai said that Morey had touched on \u201ca third-rail issue\u201d by tweeting his support for the Hong Kong protestors.\n\n\u201cBy now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China,\u201d Tsai wrote on Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t know Daryl personally. I am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the Rockets\u2019 star player, James Harden, aligned his views with those of his team and the NBA. \u201cWe apologise. You know, we love China. We love playing there,\u201d said Harden, who was voted the league\u2019s most valuable player in 2018. \u201cFor both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.\u201d\n\nThe new NBA season starts on 22 October.", "description": "The NBA\u2019s reaction to one of its executives speaking out on the anti-government protests in Hong Kong has received criticism from several US politicians", "authors": ["Tom Lutz"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568c9a4906a1f107d569801d3e531cb1fce31843/0_80_2936_1761/master/2936.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed77ead4abf04a5e21fe0f3c38ce0dc4", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
