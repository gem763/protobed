Of course, anyone who has read Dickens as an adult, rather than forcibly in school, will realise that his books are hardly stuffy, but lively and comic.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- \u2018Diary of a wimpy King\u2019\n\n- Is Wasp Network this year\u2019s best spy thriller?\n\n- Four stars for The Truth\n\nIannucci is known for a different kind of comedy, with piercing political satires including The Death of Stalin and the TV series The Thick of It and Veep. Here he captures one of Dickens\u2019s most essential qualities, though: the ability to create main characters who are real and affecting, and minor figures who are hilariously caricatured. What\u2019s missing, and what makes this adaptation an enjoyable romp rather than a great film, is Dickens\u2019s narrative pull. Iannucci is better at shaping scenes than he is at telling a story, so the film is a bit up and down.\n\nDavid Copperfield, the novel that Dickens famously called his \u201cfavourite child\u201d, borrows much from the author\u2019s own life, including his boyhood working in a factory and his fame as a writer. The film mirrors the novel\u2019s first-person narrative by making David a famous writer at the start, on stage at a theatre reading his life story to an audience. Suddenly, the image of his childhood home appears behind him and the adult David literally walks into his own past, looking on as his young, widowed mother goes into labour. It is the first of several scenes that create a storybook feel, especially in the boyhood episodes.\n\nTwo other women who will be crucial in David\u2019s life are there at his birth, including his kindly nurse, Peggotty (Daisy May Cooper) and his aunt, Betsey Trotwood (Tilda Swinton). Swinton instantly puts her mark on the film as Betsey, striding around energetically, aghast at Peggotty\u2019s name, and so disappointed that the child is a boy and not the namesake goddaughter she expected that she leaves David\u2019s life altogether (at least for a while).\n\nMost of the characters leap off the screen with Dickensian verve. David\u2019s stepfather, the cruel Mr Murdstone (Darren Boyd), is too pallid a villain. But Murdstone\u2019s sister, Jane, is played perfectly by Gwendoline Christie with a cold-blooded stare that would alarm adults as well as children, her pale face glaring out from her black bonnet.\n\nThe Murdstones send David to work in a bottling factory, where he boards with the always short-of-funds Mr Micawber and his family. Peter Capaldi as Micawber and Bronagh Gallagher as the endlessly loyal Mrs Micawber sharply define their fairly small roles. Later, Ben Whishaw makes the obsequious Uriah Heep the slimiest of villains.\n\nThe effect is to reinterpret Dicken\u2019s characters in a way that makes sense today, putting a contemporary lens on the 19th-Century story\n\nBut the film really takes off when Patel takes over as David, still in the bottling factory. Patel was an inspired choice for the role, engaging and likable. The actors are from several races and ethnicities, a fact the film never calls attention to. The effect is to reinterpret Dicken\u2019s characters in a way that makes sense today, putting a contemporary lens on the 19th-Century story.\n\nWhen the Murdstones tell David that his mother has died and is already buried, he escapes the factory. Patel gets to yell in grief and anger and crash bottles to the floor, then sets off to see his Aunt Betsey. That\u2019s where the film finds its best voice, tender and funny at once. Betsey lives in a cottage where she is constantly shooing passing donkeys off her property. She has taken in Mr Dick (Laurie) a kind, erudite and delusional man who hears Charles I in his head. Swinton, Laurie and Patel make an incomparable trio, and their scenes, in any configuration, might have been a delightful film in itself.\n\nWithout losing her comic edge, Swinton shows Betsey to be as kind-hearted underneath as she is imperious on the surface, and Laurie is a master at tossing off comic lines. When Mr Dick simply states the obvious, Laurie can make it funny. But he is also poignant, as we see how tortured Mr Dick is by the voices in his head. David, ever the writer, helps by suggesting they put Charles I words on Mr Dick\u2019s kite and let them fly away.\n\nIannucci and his co-writer Simon Blackwell (who has worked with Iannucci on many projects) have efficiently conflated scenes and condensed Dickens\u2019s lengthy novel. But in emphasising David\u2019s trajectory as a writer, they short-change his romantic life. And in focusing on the comedy \u2013 there are plenty of set pieces, including one when bailiffs pull the Micawbers\u2019 carpet out from under the door \u2013 they eliminate at least one major tragedy. Dickens was also a sentimentalist, which you\u2019d never guess from this film.\n\nThe childish Dora, whom David marries in the book, has the same naivete here, but less importance in the story. When David falls in love, he sees Dora everywhere, and in another of Iannucci\u2019s inventive choices, the film visualises his fantasies. A carriage driver has Dora\u2019s blonde curls on his head; so does the dome of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Morfydd Clark plays both Dora and David\u2019s equally young mother, although that oddly revealing detail is easy to miss.\n\nThe film races too abruptly toward its end. Of course, in the 19th Century, Dickens had the luxury of going on and on. Iannucci takes two hours, and delivers a warm and lively David Copperfield for today.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nLove film?
