Still, they couldn\u2019t help but watch a replay of the third-largest comeback in FBS history on their charter flight back home.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t script a better movie ending for that game,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt was just fun time, a great team win.\u201d\n\nWhat stood out to wide receiver Kyle Philips on the tiny seatback screens early Sunday morning was the same reaction he had during the second half when the Bruins had started to rally back after trailing 49-17 midway through the third quarter - that a defense that would end up allowing 720 yards of total offense and nine touchdown passes to the Cougars had provided a critical spark.\n\nWoods recovered two fumbles and intercepted a pass, accounting for three of the defense\u2019s six takeaways against Washington State. UCLA (1-3, 1-0 Pac-12) forced just two turnovers during its three nonconference losses.\n\nThe redshirt senior thought Washington State was susceptible to takeaways because the wide receivers were \u201cloose\u201d in holding the ball. That suspicion proved to be the case, with Woods recovering a fumble with 2:27 remaining in the fourth quarter that set up the winning 15-yard touchdown pass from Dorian Thompson-Robinson to Demetric Felton.\n\nCoach Chip Kelly praised Woods for not giving up on the play even after the whistle had blown, jumping on a fumble forced by linebacker Krys Barnes. It was Woods\u2018 immediate recovery that resulted in the change of possession after video review determined Washington State wide receiver Easop Winston Jr. was not down before the ball came loose.\n\n\u201cJosh was rushing the passer, but it was a byproduct of his effort in turning and running to the football, which we practice every day,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut with 2:38 to go in the game, he\u2019s really doing it.\u201d\n\nThe sequence was emblematic of the determination that fueled UCLA\u2019s comeback.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep that mindset the whole game,\u201d Woods said. \u201cYou can\u2019t let up no matter what the score is.\u201d\n\nWoods would know about big comebacks. He was a junior when UCLA rallied from a 34-point deficit to beat Texas A&M; 45-44 to open the 2017 season, second only to when Michigan State overcame a 35-point margin to defeat Northwestern in 2006.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my second big comeback, and those times are special,\u201d Woods said. \u201cYou always remember them.\u201d\n\nBut those Bruins were unable to carry the momentum from that win through the rest of the season, finishing 6-7. Coach Jim Mora was fired after the loss to rival Southern California, and Kelly was hired six days later.\n\nKelly\u2019s ballyhooed arrival has not yet turned UCLA into a consistent winner, in part because of an underperforming defense that has failed to produce takeaways and tackles for loss at the same rate the defense did during his successful stint at Oregon. While this win could represent a turning point in his tenure after going 3-12 through his first 14 games in Westwood, Kelly went out of his way to emphasize that the Bruins are not a finished product yet, pointing to the number of missed tackles that allowed Washington State to amass so many points and yards.\n\n\u201cFortunately for us, in a shootout game, we were prepared to play in a shootout game and capitalized on it,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut last week\u2019s game doesn\u2019t have any bearing on this week\u2019s game, and that\u2019s what I think our players have to understand. We played well last Saturday \u2018cause we practiced well during the week. That\u2019s the real correlation that we\u2019re trying to hit home with our players.\u201d\n\nThe message seems to have taken hold, as Woods said he had moved past the win as soon as practice started on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cWe put it to bed right now,\u201d Woods said. \u201cNow it\u2019s Arizona.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Linebacker Josh Woods and the rest of the victorious UCLA traveling party already knew how their improbable 67-63 win at Washington State had unfolded.
