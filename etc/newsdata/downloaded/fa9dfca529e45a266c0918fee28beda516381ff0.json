(Photo: Denise Truscello/WireImage)\n\nSiegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn were the most celebrated duo to take the Las Vegas stage, until Roy was attacked during the pair\u2019s iconic Siegfried & Roy show in 2003. On Friday, the famous team sat down for an interview with ABC\u2019s 20/20, marking their first primetime interview in over a decade.\n\nDuring the interview, Fischbacher reflected on how he and Horn met in 1959 while both worked on a luxury cruise liner traveling from Germany to the United States. Siegfried told 2020 that Roy wasn\u2019t too impressed with his magic, and Roy asked his friend whether he could \u201cmake a cheetah disappear\u201d in the same way a magician would do with a rabbit. Horn ushered Fischbacher into his room, revealing that \u2014 surprise! \u2014 he had snuck his pet cheetah onboard the ship. The pair soon integrated the cheetah into their magic show and received a standing ovation.\n\n\u201cIn show business you don\u2019t have to be only good; you have to be different. And Roy brought the difference,\u201d Siegfried previously told Barbara Walters, as seen on 20/20.\n\nFast-forward to the duo\u2019s successful Vegas act on Oct. 3, 2003: Horn appeared with Montecore, a white tiger, in a live Siegfried & Roy performance at the Mirage hotel-casino. It was during that show that things went horribly wrong. \u201cThe one thing that is clear is that that night changed Siegfried and Roy forever,\u201d said ABC host Deborah Roberts.\n\nAccording to a computer simulation shown on 20/20, during the 2003 performance, Montecore became confused, so Horn gave him a tap on the head, a command to obey. The animal took Horn\u2019s hand with his mouth and pushed it away. Looking to distract the animal, Horn tapped Montecore with the microphone and stumbled over the tiger\u2019s paw, falling over onstage. The 400-pound tiger stood above Horn, attaining control of the situation.\n\n\u201cThen I saw, oh my God, Roy\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Siegfried previously told Barbara Walters, in a clip shared on 20/20.\n\nWhile some audience members assumed it was part of the act, many knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cMontecore was standing over me. I saw his beautiful blue eyes,\u201d Horn told ABC.\n\nFour handlers ran onstage to help, but none were successful. It was then that Montecore reached down with his mouth and grabbed Horn by his neck, dragging him offstage toward his cage. Staff members gave Montecore two quick blasts with a fire extinguisher, forcing the animal to drop Horn. Handlers quickly stuck their fingers in the puncture wounds to stop the flow of blood until paramedics arrived on the scene. Despite his life-threatening injuries, Horn repeatedly told handlers not to \u201churt Montecore\u201d as he was whisked off by paramedics.\n\nWhile videotape of the attack exists, the hotel will not authorize its release.\n\n\u201cAs I laid on the operation table, I had an out-of-body experience. I stepped off the table. I see the bright, bright lights. But I got a message to return,\u201d Horn told ABC\u2019s Elizabeth Vargas.\n\nThe next morning, Fischbacher played music for Horn at his hospital bed and saw a tear run down his face. Fischbacher said it was that moment when he realized that Horn would survive.\n\n\u201cDoctors were able to save Horn\u2019s life, and he eventually made a remarkable recovery, but he had suffered a stroke, though when the stroke happened and what caused the tiger to bite Horn has been questioned,\u201d reported ABC News.\n\nIn 2014, Horn told Maria Shriver during an NBC interview that he had fainted onstage, and Montecore was only trying to help him by dragging him away. \"It's just my body. I have high blood pressure,\" he said, according to the Las Vegas Sun. And when Montecore died at age 17 in 2014, Roy eulogized the \u201clifesaver\u201d animal on Facebook. \u201c...Montecore who was the one responsible for pulling me to safety where the paramedics could help me after my high blood pressure made me dizzy onstage. He is greatly missed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn sat down with ABC\u2019s \u201c20/20,\" revealing some extremely personal moments.", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vc6kuYrSPKJrAh_UfFkTow--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9MzY3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ba66b850-e217-11e9-bfbe-6d05c212a322", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
