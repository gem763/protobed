It was an almost empty car park. He was clearly watching and waiting to strike.\n\n'It was as if he'd waited for one second past their ticket time to issue a ticket - disgusting.'\n\nParking fines at the Centre cost between \u00a350 and \u00a370 but this is halved if they manage to pay within two weeks\n\nAnd on returning, they found parking tickets stuck to their windscreen.\n\nParking fines at the Centre cost between \u00a350 and \u00a370 but this is halved if they pay within two weeks\n\nThe motorist asked 'what's the point of coming into Grimsby' if people cannot park in an empty car park on a Sunday for the main attraction.\n\nThey said: 'Why can't the council develop a free-for-two-hours policy or make parking free on a Sunday like they have in North Lincolnshire?'\n\nBy loosening the parking rules, there would be more people coming into the town.\n\nA coach driver has been previously fined \u00a350 for parking in the Fishing Heritage Centre's carpark despite vehicles being allowed a free drop-off slot (Centre pictured)\n\nBut the 'need to generate revenues' was key driver for policy and means it can be quite difficult trying to figure out the best options, according to North East Lincolnshire Council.\n\nThe spokesperson said 'we always appreciate peoples' views' on parking.\n\nBut this is not the first incident of this kind as a coach driver was fined \u00a350 for parking in the 'coach-only' space to drop off children at the Grimsby attraction.\n\nIt was claimed that a pay-and-display ticket was needed but was later found out coach drivers are given free parking for collecting visitors.\n\nSpeaking at the time, the coach driver told the Mirror: 'You shouldn't have to pay to park when you're bringing a group of children to be educated in a place like this, you're only doing your job - it seems a bit unfair.\n\n'I think the council is just clutching at straws trying to get every driver they can now.'", "description": "A parking warden has been captured 'watching and waiting to strike' a man and a teenage boy with parking ticket for 20 minutes at the Fishing Heritage Centre carpark in Grimsby, last Sunday.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/16/19929148-0-image-a-30_1571499154926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
