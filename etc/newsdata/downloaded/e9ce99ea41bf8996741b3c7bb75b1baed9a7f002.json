Labour and other opposition parties abstained on the motion, meaning that it did not pass.\n\nLabour have called repeatedly for a general election since the last in June 2017, but their MPs were instructed not to approve the plan designed to stop a no-deal Brexit had entered the statute books, which is not likely to happen until at least next week.\n\nIt must first be approved by the House of Lords before heading back to the Commons, where it would receive final approval.\n\nNick Brown, Labour's chief whip, reportedly told a meeting of Labour MPs on Tuesday evening that they wanted Johnson to \"stew in his own juices\" before they backed an election.\n\nJohnson called on Corbyn to reflect on the \"unsustainability\" of Labour's position in opposing an election.\n\n\"He has become the first leader of the opposition in the democratic history of our country to refuse the invitation to an election. I can only speculate as to the reasons behind his hesitation. The obvious conclusion is that he does not think he will win.\"\n\nConfusion over Corbyn's election position\n\nThe Labour Party is divided over whether to vote for an October 15 election or to force Johnson to hold a later one.\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn indicated on Wednesday afternoon that he would back an October election, and would vote for one as soon as the prime minister is legally required to seek a Brexit extension by October 19.\n\n\"We want a general election,\" the Labour leader's spokesman said.\n\n\"We want to be sure of stopping a no-deal crash-out on the 31st. We want to be sure of the government being unable to change the date or allow a crash-out during an election campaign and pre-empt the decision of the people in an election campaign. We have been attempting to find the mechanisms to do those three things. We think we can do those three things.\"\n\nHe said Corbyn would agree to an October 15 once the bill is law, which would be next week.\n\nBut Corbyn's position seems to be at odds with many other Labour MPs, including Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary.\n\nAt a meeting of Labour MPs on Wednesday morning, many insisted that they did not want an election bill until Boris Johnson had actually been forced to delay Brexit beyond October 31 because it would weaken his position.\n\nBen Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, said it was the \"unanimous view\" of Labour MPs that they \"won't vote for a pre-November election.\"\n\nHis stance appears to be backed by Keir Starmer, who told the meeting that \"the bill has to be implemented, not just passed, before a general election,\" according to a PoliticsHome report.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and Corbyn's key ally, also indicated that he was not committed to an October 15 election, saying that Labour was considering \"a range of options.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Boris Johnson was dealt another blow to his authority on Wednesday after MPs rejected his attempt to force a snap general election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2775/543ca8fbb2654135ab54d9af7cb6e2a8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
