Kelly Wants Her Money Back", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Antonio Perez/Getty Images\n\nBack in February, a mysterious person posted $100,000 for R. Kelly\u2019s bail, which was enough of the full $1 million for him to get out of jail at the time. That person was eventually identified as Valencia Love, and now she wants her money back. Love\u2019s lawyer filed a motion in the Cook County Circuit Court last week to try and recover it, but the presiding judge said not today, according to reporting by The Chicago Sun-Times. (It\u2019s possible the money could be returned to her when the court proceedings are finished, but that is potentially years away.) The thing is, though, she\u2019s not turning her back on the singer accused of many rapes and sexual assaults. \u201cAt no point have I ever supported a pedophile,\u201d Love told the paper. \u201cHe has not been convicted yet. Why is it so bad that I did a favor for a friend?\u201d Kelly, she says, actually paid her back months ago, and that the bail money was just a short term loan while he didn\u2019t have access to his cash. The reason she\u2019s trying to get it now is apparently so she can reinvest it in his defense \u201cto cover his legal costs and other expenses.\u201d\n\nKelly was able to leave jail after Love bailed him out, but he went back into custody in July after a federal indictment containing charges of child pornography and enticing minors was unsealed. With the disgraced entertainer back behind bars, Love thought the money could come back to her. \u201cWhy is it such a big deal? He\u2019s already locked up,\u201d she told the Sun-Times. \u201cWhy can\u2019t the bail money be returned?\u201d According to Love\u2019s own lawyer she also put up $50,000 to cover for unpaid child support, but Love, apparently, denies she did so.\n\nKelly is currently being held in a federal detention center in Chicago. Across indictments in Cook County and New York as well as federal charges (and perhaps also Minnesota), he has been charged with aggravated criminal sexual abuse, racketeering, criminal sexual assault by force, enticing a minor, child pornography, aggravated criminal sexual abuse against a victim between the ages of 13 and 16, and obstruction of justice.", "description": "Valencia Love, the woman who posted $100,000 to bail R.
