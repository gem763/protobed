He is the District\u2019s 101st firefighter to die in the line of duty and the first since Lt. Kevin McRae had a heart attack at a fire in Shaw in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPictures of Graham show a gregarious-looking man with a big smile framed by a goatee and mustache, posing happily with friends or grilling racks of ribs. But those who knew him described him as quiet and humble, one to \u201cnever seek the limelight.\u201d\n\nTo say he liked to fix things understated his abilities. He was a craftsman.\n\n\u201cHe liked turning wrenches, and he was good at it,\u201d said D.C. Deputy Fire Chief Gary W. Steen Jr., who oversees the department\u2019s vehicle fleet. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be irreplaceable. I\u2019ll probably have to have five or six people to handle all the tasks he took on.\u201d\n\nRobert Small, one of Graham\u2019s close friends and a fellow firefighter, said Graham performed a job unseen by many but crucial to keeping people safe.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNothing is worse than . . . having an engine that won\u2019t pump water or a ladder that won\u2019t go up when there\u2019s a fire,\u201d said Small, assigned to Engine 12 in Brentwood. \u201cYou don\u2019t get mulligans in the fire department. It has to go right every time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) noted Graham\u2019s death in a tweet, saying, \u201cwith every tour he made our city safer and our community stronger.\u201d Fire officials said Monday that funeral plans were incomplete; Graham lived near Annapolis, never married and had no children. He also volunteered at the firehouse in Herald Harbor outside Annapolis in Anne Arundel County.\n\n\u201cHe was not doing the glamorous jobs,\u201d said Dabney Hudson, president of the D.C. firefighters union. \u201cBut he would do whatever was needed to be done to make sure we had the best of everything. No job was beneath him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was Graham\u2019s behind-the-scenes work at the training center that earned him the recognition that his friends said he tried to avoid \u2014 firefighter of the year in 2018. The citation credited him with helping turn around a fleet that had been in disrepair.\n\nAD\n\nGraham helped fix the trucks and oversaw contractors who every year had to test the water flow through 68 engines to ensure that each could pump 1,250 gallons a minute.\n\nNoticing that ropes used to help extend and support free-standing ladders were breaking frequently, Graham discovered that it was caused by a cleaning solution, Small said. He said Graham not only researched the problem but also traveled from firehouse to firehouse to restring 500 ladders.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Graham didn\u2019t have his toolbox, he worked shifts out of the Lanier Heights firehouse, a station built in 1908 and tucked into the middle of a residential street near Adams Morgan. Friends said he didn\u2019t hesitate to make repairs and do touch-ups at the Spanish Colonial Revival-style station on Lanier Place NW.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you needed something done, you could always call on Alex,\u201d Small said.\n\nAD", "description": "Alex Graham, 48, is the District\u2019s 101st firefighter to die in the line of duty.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
