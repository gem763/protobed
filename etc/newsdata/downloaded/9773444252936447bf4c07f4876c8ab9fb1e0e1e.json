And she appears to have certainly been pissed off by Joss Sackler, of the Sackler family, the billionaire OxyContin manufacturers behind Purdue Pharma who have been accused of causing America\u2019s opioid crisis.\n\nAccording to Love, Sackler and her team reached out to Love to attend an NYFW show of her clothing line, LBV, at the Bowery Hotel on Monday, offering her $100,000, hair and makeup, and a car service, as well as \u201ca custom-made \u2018Phoenix\u2019 dress from LBV embroidered with 24-carat gold thread.\u201d\n\nIn February, when Sackler first debuted \u201cLBV,\u201d she rejected any connections made between her line and Purdue, despite being married to David Sackler, a board member at his family\u2019s company from 2012 to 2018. Her team reportedly tried to emphasize this distance in their email to Love, saying that \u201cthe brand has no relation to Purdue \u2026 other than that Joss is married to the family.\u201d (David Sackler is named in a lawsuit, filed this year by the Massachusetts attorney general, as one of \u201ceight people in a single family\u201d who \u201cmade the choices that caused much of the opioid epidemic.\u201d)\n\nAfter that initial fashion show, in response to questions about how she\u2019s paying for her fashion company, Sackler claimed that a male entrepreneur would not be subjected to the same scrutiny. She seems to have emphasized this dubious female empowerment angle in her second collection: When reaching out to Love, Sackler\u2019s team reportedly wrote she \u201cbest embodies the women\u201d whom Sackler\u2019s line, is intended for: \u201cstrong and undeterred.\u201d\n\nShe might be regretting this tack, now that Love is showing just how undeterred she really is. A former Oxy addict herself (now one year sober), whose husband Kurt Cobain famously died of a heroin overdose, Love is calling Sackler\u2019s overture \u201cshameless and offensive after everything I, many of my friends, and millions of other addicts have been through with OxyContin.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sober,\u201d she said to Page Six, \u201cbut I will always be an opioid addict, it doesn\u2019t vanish. I will always be that, I am just in recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoss is delusional,\u201d Love also told Page Six, \u201ctalking about her fashion line and private members club, their \u2018philanthropical arm.\u2019 What about instead giving money to rehab facilities, paying for Narcan (a medication that counters opioid overdoses) or creating a non-addictive painkiller?\u201d\n\nAnd she didn\u2019t stop there. Love has continued to excoriate Sackler on Instagram, with screenshots from articles about the Sackler family\u2019s involvement in working to create lethally addictive narcotics for huge profit. She even included a shot of the LBV \u201cPhoenix\u201d dress with the solid gold breast plate, \u201cfor??\u201d Love wrote.\n\nIn one caption, Love compared Sackler to Eva Braun \u2013 \u201cjust an empowered woman who married into the Hitler family.\u201d\n\nLove is not the only one avoiding Sackler\u2019s runway show. Apparently \u201ca number of high profile invitees\u201d also skipped it. Sometimes shame \u2013 \u201cshame, shame, shame,\u201d as Love wrote \u2013 is the best medicine.", "description": "Courtney Love says she was offered $100,000 by Joss Sackler, married to David Sackler, whose family owns OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, to attend her fashion week show, and Love is incensed.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/09/9-courtney-love-joss-sackler.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
