The proposal would bar Chinese firms from listing on U.S. exchanges, limit American pension investments in Chinese markets, and cap the value of Chinese securities in American indexes. With an impending tariff increase from 25 percent to 30 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods planned for October 15 and further tariffs slated for December, the prospect of capital limits add a new dimension of uncertainty to the U.S.\u2013China trade war \u2014 and responses to the idea illustrate a rift between policymakers and the business community on the China question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House denied the report, but not everyone is convinced. On Wednesday, Raymond James analyst Ed Mills wrote: \u201cThe current political environment means these efforts will likely gather steam.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the proposal reflects a bipartisan legislative effort spearheaded by Senator Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). In June, Rubio, along with senators Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.), cosponsored the EQUITABLE Act, which would \u201cdelist foreign companies that do not comply with U.S. accounting and oversight regulations from American exchanges.\u201d That bill would, if implemented, give Chinese firms three years to either alter their financial reporting practices or be cut off from the world\u2019s largest capital market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to these senators, access to American markets is a privilege, not a right. In December 2018, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Company Accountability Oversight Board (PCAOB) said as much in a report on Chinese business practices: \u201cA U.S. listing carries with it the assumption that U.S. rules and regulatory oversight apply.\u201d But Chinese law requires that companies\u2019 books and records be kept within the country, and restricts foreign audit work papers from being transferred outside of China. According to the SEC/PCAOB report, these laws reduce broad market confidence, while also allowing unscrupulous actors to hide fraud, an argument Rubio recently echoed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nNevertheless, some observers reject capital controls as too heavy-handed, arguing that market participants should be free to take risk on Chinese firms. Stephen Roach, an economist and senior fellow at Yale University, told National Review that any implementation of capital controls would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster.\u201d Chinese companies with audit risk will be \u201cpriced accordingly,\u201d he says, and \u201cinvestors who want to take their chance on poor audits are free to do so.\u201d Mary E. Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute on International Economics, also expressed skepticism: Delisting Chinese companies would \u201cundermine international confidence in American financial markets\u201d and \u201cincrease the attractiveness of other exchanges,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA true financial decoupling would be a wrenching process. Asset managers would be hard-pressed to avoid China given its inclusion in index funds, which permit investors to track broad market trends rather than pick individual stocks. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), which manages retirement accounts for public employees, has used the MSCI \u201cAll Country World ex-US\u201d Index as a benchmark since 2017.\n\nLovely told National Review that restricting investment in this index means \u201cU.S. investors will miss the long-term growth opportunities provided by Chinese firms.\u201d China hawks in Washington view that as a pill Americans have to swallow. In a Monday op-ed, senator Rubio and his Senate colleague Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) argued that the FRTIB\u2019s investment in the MSCI index funnels American retirement savings \u201cdirectly to a regime that poses one of the greatest threats to our nation\u2019s long-term security and prosperity\u201d and helps capitalize, among other things, Chinese surveillance practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis debate \u2014 D.C. China hawks on one side, business-community doves on the other \u2014 underscores a broader rift. Since the 2016 election, Washington has reached a general consensus that China\u2019s policies harm the global trading system. But investors eager to participate in Chinese growth feel handicapped by restrictions, and many economists remain skeptical of an interventionist approach. The rift has played out within the White House, where national-security officials and economic policymakers have occasionally found themselves at loggerheads on China.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, improving Chinese auditing standards might be seen as facilitating the integration of China into the global financial system. But in the context of an acerbic trade war, even minor reforms to the multilateral trading system are often interpreted as protectionist. In an effort to defend the so-called \u201crules-based international order,\u201d China doves risk placing a waning emphasis on the rules.", "description": "The proposal would bar Chinese firms from listing on U.S. exchanges, limit American pension investments in Chinese markets, and cap the value of Chinese securities in American indexes.", "authors": ["Daniel Tenreiro", "Andrew C.
