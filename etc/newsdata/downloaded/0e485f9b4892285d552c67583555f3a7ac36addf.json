(AP) - Wade Miley bounced back from two disastrous starts with six strong innings and Josh Reddick\u2019s five hits included a two-run homer Sunday as the Houston Astros beat the Kansas City Royals 12-3, completing a three-game sweep.\n\nAbraham Toro and Reddick each drove in three runs, Kyle Tucker banged a two-run homer and Yuli Gurriel\u2019s solo shot was his 28th homer.\n\nThe Astros\u2018 98th victory tied them for tops in the majors with the New York Yankees, who lost at Toronto. Both are 98-53.\n\nHouston rebounded after getting swept in three games at home by Oakland and got a welcome outing from Miley (14-5), who was knocked out in the first inning in each of his previous two starts. Last Tuesday, the A\u2019s tagged him for seven runs in what became a 21-7 drubbing.\n\nIt was Jakob Junis (9-14) who left early on Sunday, allowing five runs on seven hits in 2 2/3 innings, his shortest outing in 77 career starts.\n\nGurriel homered to open the second, and the Astros later got RBI singles from Toro and Michael Brantley to make it 3-1.\n\nReddick pulled a two-run homer down the right-field line off reliever Eric Skoglund in the fifth inning for a 7-1 lead. Tucker went the same direction with his two-run shot off Kyle Zimmer in the eighth.\n\nMiley didn\u2019t make it through the first unscathed. Adalberto Mondesi got an infield hit and raced home on Jorge Soler\u2019s first triple of the season, a gapper to right center. Soler has 44 home runs this year, but this was only his third career triple and his first since he was with the Chicago Cubs in 2015.\n\nMiley allowed two runs on seven hits and two walks in six innings.\n\nADVANTAGE ASTROS?\n\nManager A.J. Hinch said his team should be plenty motivated to finish with the best record in the majors and earn home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe want to win as many games as we can,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cOf course, the home field matters but it\u2019s not an end-all, be-all. There\u2019s a lot that has to happen to get to the finish. It\u2019s important. We\u2019re trying to win every game. Our mentality in (the clubhouse) is really good. \u2026 We feel like we have the best team in baseball. That can be represented in the record, sometimes it\u2019s not. We don\u2019t control what the Yankees do or what the Dodgers do or what the Braves are doing. We only control what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Astros, after an open date Monday, return to Houston on Tuesday night for the first of two games against Texas. The Rangers will match RHP Lance Lynn (14-10, 3.72 ERA) with Justin Verlander (18-6, 2.58). Verlander has held opponents to a .168 average, tied with teammate Gerrit Cole for the majors\u2019 best.\n\nThe Royals travel to Oakland to open a three-game series Monday night, sending RHP Glenn Sparkman (4-11, 5.94) against RHP Tanner Roark (10-8, 4.01).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wade Miley bounced back from two disastrous starts with six strong innings and Josh Reddick's five hits included a two-run homer Sunday as the Houston Astros beat the Kansas City Royals 12-3, completing a three-game sweep.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dick Kaegel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/astros_royals_baseball_68816_c0-145-3462-2163_s1770x1032.jpg?c14203454200c2738309965d5fd77cad16a07e0f", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
