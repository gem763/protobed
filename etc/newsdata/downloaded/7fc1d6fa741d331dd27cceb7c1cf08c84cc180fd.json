Both have won four majors, with Koepka winning this year's USPGA Championship. McIlroy pipped Koepka to the PGA Tour's player of the year award after winning three times in 2019.\n\nThey also went head-to-head during two big events, the WGC St Jude Invitational and the Tour Championship, with each player winning one.\n\nBrooks Koepka is the current world No 1 after two stunning years at the top of the game\n\nHe said that Rory McIlroy, world No 2, is not a direct rival of his because of major performance\n\nBut Koepka seemed to poke fun at McIlroy, 30, after being asked whether there is a rivalry between the two players.\n\nThe 29-year-old American has won four major titles since 2017, but McIlroy's lats major came at the 2014 USPGA.\n\nKoepka said: 'I've been out here for, what, five years. Rory hasn't won a major since I've been on the PGA Tour. So I just don't view it as a rivalry.'\n\nIt is up to McIlroy in particular to challenge Koepka over the next year after the American's impressive form in the majors.\n\nAnd while Koepka wants to strengthen his position as world No 1 for as long as possible, he doesn't feel there is a single rivalry in golf, despite what others may say.\n\nMcIlroy's last major victory came at Valhalla in August 2014 at the PGA Championship\n\nKoepka's last major title was also the PGA Championship but at Bethpage in May this year\n\nKoepka added: 'I'm not looking at anybody behind me. I'm No 1 in the world. I've got open road in front of me I'm not looking in the rearview mirror, so I don't see it as a rivalry.\n\n'You know if the fans do [call it a rivalry], then that's on them and it could be fun.\n\n'Look I love Rory, he's a great player and he's fun to watch, but it's just hard to believe there's a rivalry in golf. I just don't see it.'", "description": "Brooks Koepka has poked a little bit of fun at Rory McIlroy after being asked whether there is a rivalry between the two players.
