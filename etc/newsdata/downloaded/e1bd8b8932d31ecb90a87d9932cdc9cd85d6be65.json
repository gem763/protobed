After that, a permanent cease-fire would take place and, in return, the Trump administration would agree to drop sanctions announced last week.\n\nThose commitments by the administration are complicating the GOP efforts to pass legislation sanctioning Ankara.\n\nDespite the ceasefire deal, lawmakers are pledging to push forward with legislation.\n\nThe House already passed a resolution breaking with Trump\u2019s Syria decision in an 354-60 vote, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi arrives in Jordan with bipartisan congressional delegation Trump says his Doral resort will no longer host G-7 after backlash Scrap House defense authorization provision benefitting Russia MORE (D-Calif.) has vowed the chamber would take up a \"strong, bipartisan sanctions package.\" That vote was expected to take place this week, but a Democrat aide said it had been delayed due to changes to the House schedule in the wake of Rep.

That does not guarantee either will be brought up for a vote, and initial floor guidance for this week from McConnell\u2019s office did not mention Syria-related legislation.\n\nMcConnell, during a floor speech late last week, said he wanted \u201csomething stronger\u201d than the House-passed resolution and appeared to hint that additional legislation could be forthcoming.\n\n\u201cMy preference would be for something even stronger than the resolution the House passed yesterday, which has some serious weaknesses.
