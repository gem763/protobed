Must be a lovely change for Jackie O to work on a show alongside an incredibly round, pink-faced monster.\u201d\n\nHansen then referenced Kyle and Jackie O\u2019s recent contract extension with KIIS FM which will see the pair earn more than $35,000 each for every single show between now and the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve just signed new contracts giving them each $8 million dollars a year,\u201d Hansen said. \u201c$8 million dollars. If you break that down, that works out as roughly $4 million dollars for every interesting, new thought that Kyle has per year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many of you were at Kyle\u2019s \u2018Radio Alive\u2019 session yesterday, but he said his two favourite things in the world are cars and masturbation: so he basically just loves emissions,\u201d Taylor continued. \u201cHe\u2019s Greta Thunberg\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nKyle and Jackie O weren\u2019t the only ones who copped it from The Chaser comedians during their opening monologue.\n\nSydney\u2019s 2Day FM was also on the receiving end of a brutal joke after the station recently sacked its sixth breakfast show in six years due to poor ratings.\n\n\u201cAnother year, another axed 2Day FM breakfast show,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cMan, even racehorses get put down more humanely. And now, no-one wants the gig. Literally nobody! George Pell, Julian Assange \u2014 they\u2019ve all said, \u2018No, we\u2019d rather stay in jail than do 2Day FM breakfast\u2019.\u201d\n\nTriple M\u2019s Hot Breakfast host Eddie McGuire, who isn\u2019t attending, was also the butt of a joke with Taylor saying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t use the disabled toilets, they\u2019re specifically reserved for Eddie McGuire to make fun of whichever disabled people he finds in there\u201d.\n\nMore than 900 radio professionals from around the country are attending tonight\u2019s awards at Brisbane\u2019s Royal International Convention Centre.\n\nThe big award of the night, radio\u2019s equivalent of the Gold Logie, is the award for Best On-Air Team. The FM nominees battling it out for this year\u2019s title are KIIS FM\u2019s Kyle and Jackie O, Nova\u2019s Kate, Tim and Marty, WSFM\u2019s Jonesy and Amanda, Fox FM\u2019s Fifi, Fev and Byron, Nova\u2019s Chrissie, Sam and Browny and Triple M\u2019s Kennedy Molloy.\n\nYou can see a full list of nominees here.", "description": "The Chaser comedians absolutely destroyed Kyle Sandilands during their hilarious opening monologue at the ACRAs (Australian Commercial Radio Awards).", "authors": ["Andrew Bucklow"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/abd945585767475c0f7d863dc664a592?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
