He was short of the end zone, and for a moment the play appeared to be over.\n\nThen, Kansas City\u2019s Bashaud Breeland emerged from the pile with the ball and began a let\u2019s-see-if-this-counts journey from one end of the field to the other.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good view of it,\u201d Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \u201cI had no idea what was going on, and then all of a sudden their defensive player snagged the ball up and started running, so it was kind of a crazy play.\u201d\n\nAmid mass confusion on the field and in the crowd, Breeland scored on a 100-yard fumble return in the third quarter, and the Chiefs went on to beat the Lions 34-30 on Sunday.\n\nTo its credit, Detroit fought back after Breeland\u2019s touchdown and had the lead in the final minute - but the Lions can look back with frustration at a couple missed opportunities in the third quarter, when they had the ball inside the Kansas City 10-yard line and didn\u2019t score.\n\nThe matchup between two undefeated teams was tied at 13 at halftime. Then the Lions and Chiefs combined to lose five fumbles in the third quarter - all in Kansas City territory. The Lions took one of those fumbles and made it to the 5-yard line, when Stafford appeared to throw a touchdown pass to Kenny Golladay. But although Golladay got two feet down, he wasn\u2019t able to control the ball completely as he fell to the ground, and by the time he secured it, he was out of bounds. The play was ruled incomplete after a review.\n\nOn the next play, Stafford tried to scramble to his left and fumbled the ball away.\n\n\u201cI was trying to do too much probably,\u201d Stafford said.\n\nThe Lions got the ball back quickly after another Kansas City fumble and drove to the 1. That was when Johnson fumbled.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be reaching the ball out,\u201d the Detroit running back said.\n\nBreeland came in from the side and picked up the ball from the pile. He couldn\u2019t be sure if the play was over or not and didn\u2019t much care.\n\n\u201cWe preach that every day. You pick up the ball at the end, whether it\u2019s alive or dead,\u201d Breeland said. \u201cYou never know. Pick it up and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n\nThe touchdown was upheld after a review.\n\n\u201cThe officials ruled on the field that they did not see the ballcarrier down. They did not see a body part other than the hand or foot down,\u201d said Al Riveron, NFL senior vice president of officiating. \u201cThe ball comes loose and then the ball was picked up by Kansas City, No. 21. He was not touched after he possessed the football. There was no whistle on the play, and he runs it back for a touchdown.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Walt Anderson\u2019s crew denied New Orleans a fumble return for a touchdown against the Rams because the play was blown dead when it shouldn\u2019t have been. This time, Anderson\u2019s crew let the play continue, and the Chiefs scored to take a 20-13 lead.\n\nThe Lions recovered, scoring the game\u2019s next 10 points, but they ultimately lost in a back-and-forth final quarter.\n\n\u201cWe fought, but it always comes back to something,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou lose points and give up points in one play, it\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kerryon Johnson fought for the goal line, disappearing into a mass of bodies.
