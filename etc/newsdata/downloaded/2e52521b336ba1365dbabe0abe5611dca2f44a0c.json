That\u2019s all I wanted, just a chance to bet on myself,\u201d said Charlton, who had made it publicly known that he wanted out of Dallas.\n\n\u201cOn the field, if you go three years down the line, then we will get to see who is right and who is wrong. It is on me now. I get to play football.\u201d\n\nA healthy scratch by the Cowboys the first two games this season, Charlton got his wish when he was released. He got claimed Thursday by the Dolphins, joined them for practice Friday and returned with his new team to Texas, where he played and had the only sack of Dak Prescott in Miami\u2019s 31-6 loss.\n\nCharlton said he didn\u2019t know for sure until Saturday that he was going to get to play, and relished the chance against his former team.\n\n\u201cIt was very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I wanted, just was real quick.\u201d\n\nCharlton, the 28th overall pick in the 2017 draft, had four sacks in 27 games for the Cowboys. He went into training camp with his roster spot in jeopardy, but was solid in preseason games while other defensive linemen recovered from injuries.\n\nWhen DeMarcus Lawrence and Tyrone Crawford returned to the Cowboys defense to start the regular season, Charlton didn\u2019t play the first two games. He got waived when Dallas needed to make room on the roster for Robert Quinn after he completed a two-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance-enhancers.\n\nQuinn also had a sack in his debut for the Cowboys (3-0) after an offseason trade from the Dolphins.\n\nCharlton got his first action on a second-down play about 2\u00bd minutes into the game, and wasn\u2019t able to make anything happen. But he was credited with an assisted tackle of Ezekiel Elliott on the next play.\n\nCowboys right tackle La\u2019el Collins knocked him to the ground on a couple of plays, and tight end Jason Witten also chipped him on one of those plays before breaking loose and going up the right sideline for a 33-yard catch-and-run.\n\nLate in the third quarter, also going against Collins, Charlton got around him and Tyron Smith to sack Prescott.\n\n\u201cSaw him in the game. \u2026 Real good. I\u2019m going to try to claim part of that,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.\n\n\u201cI told Taco good luck on everything,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him congrats on that sack or anything. I could have thrown it away, but he can have that one.\u201d\n\nPrescott then joked about not throwing away a pass to protect his completion percentage.\n\nCharlton said the Dolphins (0-3) are giving him a chance to pass rush more, which is what he wants to do. He said the sack of Prescott is something to build on as he moves into a normal week of preparation with his new team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a learning experience, learning a whole new defense, playing a whole new defense, playing a whole new position really in that defense,\u201d he said. \u201cJust continue to learn the defense, learn different things that I can do, things I can\u2019t do in that defense. In short week, I think I played OK.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Taco Charlton realizes it is now up to him to prove whether the Dallas Cowboys were right to give up on him only two seasons after the defensive lineman was their first-round draft pick.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/dolphins_cowboys_football_89758_c0-307-3615-2414_s1770x1032.jpg?ad6625c35e189c8af7bbcdbbcc7737a85e62b11e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
