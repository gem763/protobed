If Ronaldo holds that rate, he would require 28 games to equal Daei\u2019s record.\n\nHowever, Ronaldo\u2019s scoring rate has improved in the last couple of years, with coach Fernando Santos using him in a more central role and surrounding and supporting him with creativity.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If Ronaldo continues at this pace, he would require only 14 more appearances to overhaul Daei.\n\nPortugal have four Euro 2020 qualifiers to come, two of which come against minnows Luxembourg, while Santos\u2019 side also host a return fixture with Lithuania.\n\nThis could further boost his tally ahead of Euro 2020, perhaps by as many as eight goals, if Ronaldo capitalises on the weaker defences Portugal\u2019s fellow Group B combatants possess.\n\nWith friendlies and warm-up games also to come before the major tournament begins, Ronaldo could well be closing in on Daei\u2019s record by the start of\n\nEuro 2020 could bring seven more games if Portugal again reach the final.\n\nTherefore, given his recent scoring rate, it is quite conceivable that Ronaldo could break the international goal scoring record during the Euros, possibly in the final.", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo moved on to 93 international goals this week, scoring four against Lithuania\u00a0as Portugal\u00a0secured a 5-1 win in Vilnius.
