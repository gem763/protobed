She\u2019s definitely one we\u2019re going to have to keep an eye on as a rugby league community because she\u2019s brilliant at everything \u2013 she\u2019s brilliant at rugby union and a great cricketer.\u201d", "description": "Leeds Rhinos 20 Castleford Tigers 12", "authors": ["Ross Heppenstall", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-league/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212764750-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqv3hxuICTza90rxjOncu1SK8fQrJGiSc0wsot5slw59Q.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
