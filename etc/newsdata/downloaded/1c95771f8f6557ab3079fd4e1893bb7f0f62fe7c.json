(HON) and Jim Cramer is probably going to be watching as he highlighted the name during Friday's \"Mad Money\" program. Let's check out the charts and see if the indicators are pointing up or down for Honeywell, which is a holding of Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of HON, below, we can see that prices have been testing (successfully so far) the rising 200-day moving average line. Prices are trading just below the declining 50-day moving average line, but it will not take much of a rally to get prices to close above the line. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line turned up at the end of August and suggests that buyers of HON have been more aggressive ahead of the coming earnings figures. I consider the OBV line a leading indicator. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is poised to cross to the upside from below the zero line for a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of HON, below, we can see a mixed picture. Prices are testing the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line shows a slight decline the past three to four months,m suggesting some selling has been going on. The MACD oscillator is in a take profits sell mode above the zero line but the two moving averages that make up this indicator have begun to narrow and that can foreshadow an eventual go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly Point and Figure chart of HON, below, we can see a potential long-term price target of $205 projected. A weekly trade at $173.49 will be an upside breakout and a weekly trade at $153.96 will be a bearish breakdown.\n\nBottom line strategy: I think the charts and indicators of Honeywell are telling us that HON is ready to move higher. Earnings could be the catalyst. Traders could go long here and risk below the lows of October. Add on strength. Our major upside price objective is $200.", "description": "Honeywell International (HON) shares appear poised to restart their rally, with Thursday's earnings for the technology and manufacturing giant potentially serving as the catalyst for a move higher....HON", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Honeywell Appears Poised To Restart Its Rally With A", "Price Objective", "Thursday'S Earnings For The Technology", "Manufacturing Giant Could Serve As The Catalyst For A Move Higher.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Paul Price"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/b939310e-ad19-11e7-a59f-ede758380046.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
