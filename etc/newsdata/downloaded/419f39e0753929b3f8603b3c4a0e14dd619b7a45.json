The UN, Gulf Arab nations and the US accuse Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, something Tehran denies.\n\nAnalysts say the missiles used in the 14 September assault on oil sites wouldn\u2019t have enough range to reach the oil sites in eastern Saudi Arabia from impoverished Yemen. The missiles and drones used resembled Iranian-made weapons, although analysts say more study is needed to definitively link them to Iran.\n\nMr Salami added that Iran does not want to start a conflict, but appeared to warn the US and Saudi Arabia that Iran is prepared.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stop until the destruction of any aggressor. And we will not leave any secure spot,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not miscalculate and do not make a mistake.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The US Treasury Department said it took action against the Central Bank of Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s central bank chief, Abdolnasser Hemmati, attempted to shrug off the new sanctions on Saturday. According to the state-run IRNA news agency, Mr Hemmati said re-imposing sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank shows the US has little leverage left.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Iran has threatened \u201cthe full destruction of any aggressor\u201d after the Pentagon said the US would deploy additional troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the wake of attacks on major oil sites.\u00a0 Major General Hossein Salami told state media the Revolutionary Guard was prepared for \u201cany scenario\u201d and that a retaliatory attack on Iran from", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/13/Iran-Khamanei.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
