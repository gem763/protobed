At that point, a male anchor asked her if she was OK and \u201cfree from the kissing bandit,\u201d before pointing out there was a police officer right behind her.\n\n\u201cYeah, I might need some help,\u201d she responded, laughing.\n\nHey mister, here\u2019s your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!! pic.twitter.com/5O44fu4i7y \u2014 Sara Rivest (@SRivestWAVE3) September 20, 2019\n\nRivest told InsideEdition.com that when the segment ended, she \u201cjust started screaming at the man, \u2018You\u2019re so rude! You\u2019re so rude!\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Rivest said it\u2019s common for reporters to be interrupted on live TV, that doesn\u2019t make it OK. It\u2019s also a bad way to introduce yourself.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make that guy cool and it doesn\u2019t make some girl say, \u2018Oh wow, I want him,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nNearly a week after the incident, Rivest is still bothered by it.\n\n\u201cHe knew I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. And in a way, it\u2019s like an exertion of power because it\u2019s like, \u2018She can\u2019t stop me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe news hit shows her laughing, but Rivest said she didn\u2019t think it was funny.\n\nStaying upbeat \u201ccame from a place of wanting the viewer to know I was OK,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also feeling so uncomfortable that I didn\u2019t know how else to react.\u201d\n\nSince the unwanted kiss went viral, Rivest said thousands of people have reached out to her, including journalists, nurses and restaurant workers who have had similar experiences.\n\nRivest told USA Today that typically reporters don\u2019t go public with this sort of harassment because they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be the story.\u201d\n\nBut she sees value in discussing the incident.\n\n\u201cI think when we don\u2019t speak up about it, it just makes it under the radar even more,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Louisville Metro Police Department has since arrested the alleged suspect, Eric Goodman, and charged him with harassment with physical contact, a misdemeanor, according to NBC News.", "description": "Police have charged the man with harassment with physical contact.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8d3f2d1e00002f0073be22.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
