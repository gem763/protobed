Many of us know the script by heart, and, even if you haven't seen it (for shame!), odds are you've quoted it at some point. Even though I, myself, haven't had much opportunity to use my personal favorite, \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"\n\nBut, all that movie magic could soon be ruined should there be any truth to what Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra told Variety on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cVery famous people whose names I won\u2019t use, but they want to redo \u2018The Princess Bride,\u2019\u201d he revealed.\n\nInconceivable.\n\nCary Elwes himself, the dreamy star of the 1987 film directed by Rob Reiner, shared his feelings. This is one time, you can imagine, when he did not say, \"As you wish.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one. https://t.co/5N8Q3P2e5G \u2014 Cary Elwes (@Cary_Elwes) September 18, 2019\n\nI mean, the guy battled a warthog and was strapped to a torture machine for this role. Can anyone blame him for being a little peeved?\n\nA few of his old cast mates eagerly agree. Why ruin perfection?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a movie remake [would work] because I think it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Carol Kane said earlier this year. \u201cI would gather that Rob Reiner would say the same and everybody in it would say the same.\"\n\nActors who weren't in the movie still have some personal connections to it and told those unnamed sources to back off.\n\nOh really? Well, I married the six fingered man, obviously why we have stayed together for 35 years and there is only ONE The Princess Bride and it\u2019s William Goldman and @robreiner\u2019s. \u201cLife is pain highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something!\u201d https://t.co/hv33UIZKN3 \u2014 Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) September 17, 2019\n\nI can't imagine any cast trying to recreate this classic story.\n\nAnd if they do, well, I may have just found my chance to use my favorite quote after all.", "description": "Ever since Peter Falk walked into his grandson's room and .09/18/2019 19:23:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/261/c4eedee8-8cb9-44ad-91a6-9e3725cf4d95.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
