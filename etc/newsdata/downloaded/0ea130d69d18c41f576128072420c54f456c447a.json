A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks launched from Iran not Yemen, the ministry spokesman added.\n\nPresident Trump has previously said that US and Saudi investigators were trying to determine whether Iran was responsible.\n\nOn Monday he said: \u201cWell, it\u2019s looking that way. We\u2019ll have some pretty good - we\u2019re having some very strong studies done, but it\u2019s certainly looking that way at this moment. And we\u2019ll let you know. As soon as we find out definitively, we\u2019ll let you know. But it does look that way.\u201d\n\nAsked about whether military action was possible, he insisted that he did not want to go to war but added: \u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody. But we\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\u201d\n\nIran responded by saying it would retaliate \u201cimmediately\u201d to any attack.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He said: \u201c\u201cThis attack on the oil refinery by any reasonable definition is an act of war. It is attacking the world economy.\n\n\u201cIn addition to attacking the refinery in Saudi Arabia, the Iranians are increasing enrichment, putting them closer to a bomb.\u201d\n\nThree US officials told Reuters the attack was launched from Iran\u2019s southwest, and that it involved both cruise missiles and drones. The officials did not provide evidence or detail the US intelligence they used to make the assessments.\n\nUS secretary of state, Mike Pompeo is due to meet Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah on Wednesday to discuss the crisis, before heading to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThere had been suggestions that Mr Trump could use this month\u2019s United Nations general assembly meeting in New York as an opportunity to meet his Iranian counterpart, Mr Rouhani, although this now looks extremely unlikely.\n\nThere were even questions as to whether Iran\u2019s delegation would be given visas allowing them to attend the meeting because of US sanctions.\n\nForeign minister Javad Zarif was due to travel to New York on Friday, with Mr Rouhani following on Monday, according to the IRNA news agency.\n\nAs the host of the UN\u2019s headquarters, the US is mandated to offer world leaders and diplomats visas to attend meetings there. But as tensions have risen, greater restrictions have been imposed on officials like Mr Zarif. Since becoming president in 2013, Mr Rouhani has spoken each year at the general assembly.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "Donald Trump has announced by tweet that he is increasing sanctions on Iran, following the weekend attacks on Saudi oil installations.
