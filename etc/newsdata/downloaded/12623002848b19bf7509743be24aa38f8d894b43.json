When shoppers select a toy on the website, they will be redirected to Target.com to complete the purchase.\n\n\u201cOur U.S. strategy is to bring back the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us brand in a modern way through a strong experiential and content-rich omnichannel concept,\u201d TRU Kids CEO Richard Barry said. \u201cThe foundation of that strategy requires the help of a retail industry leader and Target is the ideal retailer to support a new Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us shopping experience, which is designed to provide families with endless ways to discover, play and enjoy toys.\u201d\n\nThe website will feature videos, top toy lists and product reviews. It will also have educational tools for children.\n\nTarget will power online sales in the new Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us experiential retail stores expected to launch this fall in Houston and Paramus, N.J.\n\n\u201cThe stores are designed to showcase new products out of the box, and create memorable experiences for kids and families that allow for in-person product discovery,\u201d Target said in a statement.\n\nItems that aren\u2019t in stock will be ordered online through Target.com.\n\nToys \u2018R\u2019 Us filed for bankruptcy in 2018 after a disastrous 2017 Christmas season. The toy chain closed 900 locations. Several executives and creditors formed Tru Kids Inc. to hold onto the intellectual property, including the names Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and Babies R Us and the mascot Geoffrey, the giraffe that refused to grow up.\n\nThe deal with Target is similar to the one with Kroger.\n\nBefore the holiday season, Target expanded the toy section at 500 stores nationwide. Nearly 100 stores had the toy section completely remodeled. The toy category was one of the strongest areas for Target in last year\u2019s holiday sales results, which showed same-store sales up 5.7 percent.\n\n\u201cTarget\u2019s leadership in toys, digital and fulfillment are an unbeatable platform for Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us to reconnect with their fans while we introduce them to the ease and convenience of shopping at Target,\u201d Target\u2019s senior vice president of merchandising Nikhil Nayar said in a statement. \u201cBy applying our capabilities in a new way with Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, we can serve even more shoppers, drive new growth, and build on our toy leadership.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us will make an online comeback through a partnership with Target just in time for the Christmas shopping", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
