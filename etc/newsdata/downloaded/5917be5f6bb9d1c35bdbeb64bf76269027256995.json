USA TODAY\n\nBuddy Hield claims he wants to stay in Sacramento. The Kings guard, who is set to become a restricted free agent after the season, will need a new contract to keep him happy, though.\n\nHield told reporters following the Kings' final preseason game Wednesday that he felt the front office's most recent offer of four years and $90 million (Yahoo! Sports reported the terms of the negotiations) was \"an insult.\"\n\n\"It's not always about 'Less than the max.' It's just, like, something that is reasonable, whereas it's not an insult.\" he said. \"Whereas we respect each other enough to come to an agreement.\"\n\nYahoo! reported that Hield and his representatives seek a deal closer to $110 million, closer to the maximum contract value he could sign. Hield said becoming a \"max player\" isn't a priority for him, but he said those are the type of players the Kings need to be targeting to build a winner.\n\nBuddy Hield speaks openly about his ongoing contract negotiations with the Sacramento Kings pic.twitter.com/fBTyuw9qjZ \u2014 Sports 1140 KHTK (@Sports1140KHTK) October 17, 2019\n\n\"Especially a low market like this, Sacramento ... name one big free agent who came to Sacramento,\" Hield said.\n\n\"I feel like I'm part of the group that's getting the team back to where it needs to be,\" he continued. \"Like I said, I want to be here and if they don't want me here, (that's) fine.\n\n\"If every player's not playing for the max, I don't know why you're in the NBA.\"\n\nHield brought up his humble roots growing up in the Bahamas and once more indicated that he simply wanted a fair deal than garnering the max.\n\nAs for where the Kings and Hield go from here, there's time to flesh out the extension before the season starts.\n\n\"If they don't want to do it, (I'll) just look for somewhere else to go,\" Hield said. \"Maybe in the offseason, maybe in season, I don't know. They have to plan. I don't know what their plans are for me.\"", "description": "Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield told reporters Wednesday that he felt insulted by the team's contract extension offer.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
