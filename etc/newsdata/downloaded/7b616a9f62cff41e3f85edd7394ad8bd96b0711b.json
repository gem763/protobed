Bibi was the only one who managed to convince him to come to Israel. I think that saved his life.'\n\nThe revelation appeared in Israeli media on Monday as a four-day hearing into allegations of corruption against Netanyahu came to an end.\n\nThe prime minister is accused of acting on behalf of wealthy supporters and businessmen in exchange for gifts and favourable news coverage.\n\nThe expensive gifts include champagne, hotel rooms, meals and cigars.\n\nMr Packer met Netanyahu in 2014 and later bought a waterfront home next door to the Israeli PM's private beachfront home in Caesarea.\n\nHe was a special guest at Netanyahu's speeches to the US Congress and UN General Assembly in New York in 2015 and was seen leaning over to embrace or kiss the PM's wife Sara in the House of Representatives.\n\nLeft to right: Israeli ambassador to the US Ron Dermer, Benjamin Netanyahu, an official, Benjamin's son Yair Netanyahu and James Packer in Israel\n\nJames Packer (left) greets Sara Netanyahu (right) moments before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about Iran to a joint meeting of the United States Congress in the House on March 3, 2015 in Washington, DC\n\nJames Packer and Arnon Milchan attend the New York Premiere of Noah at Clearview Ziegfeld Theatre on March 26, 2014 in New York City\n\nIn November 2017 the AFP interviewed Mr Packer on behalf of the Israelis as a witness to the investigation into Netanyahu.\n\nPacker was not a suspect and gave his full co-operation. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Mr Packer.\n\nOn Monday in Israel Netanyahu's lawyers and not the premier himself attended the closed-door hearing, which provided a final chance to convince Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit he should not be indicted.\n\nIt came as attempts by Netanyahu - who has been in office for a total of over 13 years - to form a unity government following September 17 elections are at an impasse.\n\nNetanyahu has denied the allegations against him, calling the corruption investigation a 'witch-hunt' and alleging it has been motivated by his enemies' desire to force him from office.\n\nThe premier had asked that the hearing be broadcast live because he has 'nothing to hide'.\n\nMandelblit dismissed the request in no uncertain terms, saying the hearing was intended to convince the legal authorities, not the public.\n\nThe attorney general's deliberations on whether to issue the indictments are expected to continue for weeks.\n\nNetanyahu is not required to step down as prime minister if indicted, only if convicted with all appeals exhausted.", "description": "The Australian billionaire\u00a0struck up a close friendship with Netanyahu in 2014 after they were introduced by mutual friend Arnon Milchan, a major Hollywood producer.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19459014-0-image-a-18_1570566684213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
