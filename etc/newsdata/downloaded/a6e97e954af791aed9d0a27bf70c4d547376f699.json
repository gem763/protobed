After he became \u201cJune\u201d in middle school, and began identifying himself as a girl, his interest continued, and now he competes as a girl against real girls for the University of Montana.\n\nYou may not be surprised to hear this, but he seems to be faster than them.\n\nJust to add insult to the women\u2019s injured pride, the NCAA\u2019s Big Sky Conference named Eastwood the \u201cfemale athlete of the week,\u201d after he beat another female competitor in a race, and was selected for the honor, beating out other female nominees according to The College Fix. Interestingly enough, neither UM nor the NCAA mentions the fact that Eastwood is actually a man:\n\nEastwood beat out eight other nominated competitors for Female Athlete of the Week, all of whom appear to be biological women judging by their official college headshots. The conference does not note Eastwood is transgender. The University of Montana does not even note that the conference has male and female categories in its press release on Eastwood\u2019s recognition. It simply says Eastwood was named \u201cBig Sky Conference Athlete of the Week\u201d after beating San Diego State University\u2019s Jenny Sandoval, who also appears to be a biological woman. (The Missoulian published a condensed version of the press release without identifying it as such, instead crediting the article to \u201cMissoulian staff.\u201d)\n\nUM even gave Eastwood a glowing review in an introductory video. As you can imagine, they focused quite a bit on all the \u201cnegative\u201d attention Eastwood has being thrown his way.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that in the video, they only really show one supportive fellow female athlete. The rest seem to be left out. They don\u2019t exactly allow for a well-rounded take.\n\nSo sum it up, a man wins a race meant for women, is given recognition and awards meant for women, and no one running the show thought to even mention that Eastwood was a man in the official paperwork. On top of that, they also push a propaganda piece in order to make Eastwood\u2019s arrival on the women\u2019s scene seem uplifting and legitimate.\n\nImagine being a female athlete having worked so hard for years to make it to where you are. You push yourself through grueling training and compete against people who could overtake you in a moment if you even slip once. You\u2019ve perfected your game for the majority of your life.\n\nThen when it comes time for the moment you\u2019ve been preparing for all your life, you get beat out by a guy who injected himself with some meds, grows out his hair, and demands you call him by a different name.\n\nThe only other thing that one could feel, outside of the crushing disappointment and sadness, is allout rage.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that we\u2019ve rarely seen the media put the camera on those actual women and girls who have been cast aside and shortchanged. It\u2019s telling that officials don\u2019t even want to discuss Eastwood\u2019s real sex.\n\nIt\u2019s cheating, what MU and Eastwood are doing. This needs to be called out.", "description": "NCAA Names a Man Their \u201cFemale Athlete of the Week,\u201d Leaves Out a Few Key Details About Him", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Jennifer Van Laar", "Kira Davis", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Nick Arama", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
