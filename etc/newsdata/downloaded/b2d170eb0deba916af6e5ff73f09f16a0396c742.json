(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\nAmid the celebration of the Houston Astros advancing to the World Series for the second time in three years, an executive in the organization was loudly confronting a group of three female reporters over closer Roberto Osuna, according to Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein.\n\nAstros assistant general manager Brandon Taubman reportedly yelled, half a dozen times, \u201cThank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so f---ing glad we got Osuna!\u201d The confrontation occurred with the obvious context of Osuna\u2019s past domestic violence allegation and subsequent 75-game suspension.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOne of the reporters was apparently wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and Taubman had complained about her past tweets on Osuna and domestic violence, according to NPR\u2019s David Folkenflik.\n\nTaubman was holding a cigar and standing with two or three other men at the time, eyewitnesses told the Houston Chronicle.\n\nA Houston staffer reportedly apologized for Taubman\u2019s conduct afterward. The Astros declined comment to Sports Illustrated, and also declined to make Taubman available for interview.\n\nYahoo Sports\u2019 Hannah Keyser, who was in the clubhouse at the time, confirmed the confrontation took place.\n\nAstros\u2019 claim that SI fabricated story contradicted by multiple reporters\n\nThe Astros released a statement after Sports Illustrated published its article, claiming the story was \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible,\u201d saying Taubman was \u201csupporting the player during a difficult time.\u201d It did not explain why the second staffer felt the need to apologize, nor why it declined initial comment to Sports Illustrated.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Astros just released the following statement. pic.twitter.com/KnA6kQt0hq \u2014 Chandler Rome (@Chandler_Rome) October 22, 2019\n\nHouston Chronicle reporter Hunter Atkins disputed the Astros\u2019 account of the incident, saying Sports Illustrated\u2019s report was not misleading.\n\nTwo additional members of the media anonymously confirmed Apstein\u2019s account to The Athletic\u2019s Jake Kaplan, with one even contradicting the Astros\u2019 claim that Taubman was defending a player by saying he didn\u2019t remember any players being in the area at the time.\n\nFrom The Athletic:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get a good look at whether Taubman stared at them. But he was loud and obnoxious and he said what he said,\u201d said one witness, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cHe definitely was not defending Osuna based on the bad game Osuna had. It was very clear.\u201d\n\nTaubman\u2019s pride in acquiring Osuna came shortly after the closer yielded a tying home run to New York Yankees infielder D.J. LeMahieu in Game 6 of the ALCS.\n\nThe Astros later bailed Osuna out of a blown save with Jose Altuve\u2019s walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth against Aroldis Chapman, who has also been suspended for domestic violence.\n\nAstros, MLB release additional statements\n\nThe Astros released two additional statements on Monday afternoon from Taubman and team owner Jim Crane. Neither statement addresses the team\u2019s initial Monday night statement that accused Apstein of fabricating the entire incident.\n\nBrandon Taubman: \u201cThis past Saturday, during our clubhouse celebration, I used inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed. In retrospect, I realize that my comments were unprofessional and inappropriate. My overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue. Those that know me know that I am a progressive and charitable member of the community, and a loving and committed husband and father. I hope that those who do not know me understand that the Sports Illustrated article does not reflect who I am or my values. I am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.\u201d\n\nJim Crane: \u201cThe Astros continue to be committed to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence. We not only ensure mandatory training annually for all of our employees, we have also created an important partnership with the Texas Council on Family Violence, and have raised over $300K through our initiatives to help various agencies providing important support for this cause. We fully support MLB and baseball\u2019s stance and values regarding domestic violence.\u201d\n\nMLB also released a statement about the incident, saying it plans to interview those involved.\n\n\u201cDomestic violence is extraordinarily serious and everyone in baseball must use care to not engage in any behavior \u2014 whether intentional or not \u2014 that could be construed as minimizing the egregiousness of an act of domestic violence. We became aware of this incident through the Sports Illustrated article. The Astros have disputed Sports Illustrated\u2019s characterization of the incident. MLB will interview those involved before commenting further.\u201d\n\nThe Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America released a statement welcoming the news that MLB would investigate the incident, and demanded an apology from the Astros for the conduct of Taubman and the team\u2019s public relations department. It called the Astros\u2019 initial denial of the story an \u201cunethical and intentional fabrication\u201d designed to discredit its members.\n\nAstros acquired Osuna despite domestic violence suspension\n\nOsuna, then a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, was arrested in May 2018 on a domestic assault charge for an incident involving the mother of his child.\n\nThe charges against Osuna were later dropped after the alleged victim, who wanted to continue co-parenting her child with Osuna, declined to cooperate with the investigation. Osuna agreed to a peace bond in Toronto court and was later given the 75-game suspension.\n\nDespite Osuna\u2019s suspension and their stated zero-tolerance policy for domestic violence, the Astros still felt they could reinforce their bullpen for pennies on the dollar by trading for the pitcher. The team was blasted for the move, but remained defiant that it was giving Osuna a second chance.\n\nAstros general manager Jeff Luhnow went so far as to say the situation could create some positives \u201cdown the road\u201d because Osuna would help with domestic violence awareness in the organization. Seriously. Osuna\u2019s new bullpen-mate Ryan Pressly also profanely defended the closer against a heckler for bringing up the matter.\n\nAbove all, the Astros have wanted the world to forget why Osuna was suspended and focus on his play on the field, which has remained effective. The closer will likely be key in the team\u2019s World Series matchup with the Washington Nationals, even after one of its own executives seems to have done his best to remind the world how the Astros got the reliever in the first place.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Shortly after the Astros closer allowed a tying home run in the ALCS, a team executive was loudly praising the team's acquisition of the player.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BMV24uNr7vHqbo3Y4BXL.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KTqJXTWRSvwxkMEwzbY2ZQ--~B/aD0yMjAwO3c9MzkxMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/dc7dc280-f46e-11e9-afff-4bb9fabefe63", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
