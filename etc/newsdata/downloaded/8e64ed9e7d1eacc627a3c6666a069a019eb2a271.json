She said: 'I was in shock.\n\n'It's the most important time of the year for self reflection and saying sorry. To have something like this happen at that time is quite appalling.'\n\nCommunity members believe the intruders entered the cemetery through a garden path\n\nA lone Star of David was left on the gravel at Chatham Memorial Synagogue cemetery in Kent\n\nWorshippers at the synagogue think the vandals used heavy tools such as sledgehammers, given the extent of the damage.\n\nHow Rosh Hashanah celebrates creation Rosh Hashanah celebrates the Jewish new year, with the phrase literally meaning 'head of the year'. The dates of Jewish festivals come from the Hebrew Calendar, with the Jewish new year at the start of autumn. Orthodox Jewish pilgrims in Uman, Ukraine, mark Rosh Hashanah on September 30 Rosh Hashanah marks the celebration of the creation of the world, and is a traditional time for Jewish people to reflect on the past year, think about their priorities and ask for forgiveness. The festival is observed by attending prayer services, the sounding of a horn and eating a variety of symbolic foods. It also marks the beginning of ten days of repentance, which ends with Yom Kippur, a festival which sees Jewish people fast and pray for forgiveness.\n\nMs Halpern-Matthews added: 'It's difficult to describe the sense of horror at the disrespect and needless violence.\n\n'The gate they ripped off was bolted to the wall. It was already open. It was damage for damage's sake.'\n\nPolice attended the cemetery, but a lack of CCTV hampered their investigation.\n\nMs Halpern-Matthews added: 'It's frustrating that there's little chance of a prosecution because of this.\n\n'Police can't even call it a hate crime even though it happened at the synagogue because there were no swastikas, this time.'\n\nWorried relatives have contacted the community leaders to see if their relative's graves were damaged.\n\nMs Halpern-Matthews, who has attended the synagogue since she was a child, added: 'The cemetery dates back to 1700.\n\n'You can't read some of the names on the gravestones because they are so faded. So it's hard to tell which families are affected.\n\n'The last person was buried here in 1982. The cemetery has been full since then. One of the destroyed gravestones dates to 1893 and another to 1940.'\n\nThe tight-knit Jewish community at the synagogue is living in fear after suffering two attacks in under a year.\n\nMs Halpern-Matthews attributes a spike in anti-Semitism to the Brexit referendum and politicians' use of hateful language.\n\nThe attack is thought to have happened on the night of the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah\n\nThe thugs are thought to have used heavy duty tools to tear down a large metal gate\n\nShe said: 'Before the referendum the attacks were few and far between.\n\n'We have now had swastikas daubed drawn on the ground, human excrement spread on the front door and stained glass windows smashed on the day of my son's bar mitzvah.\n\n'The damage done by Brexit is something we will be dealing with for generations.\n\n'It is any wonder people are behaving in this way when you hear how politicians speak in parliament? They are giving permission to hate.'\n\nThe majority of worshippers at the synagogue in Rochester lost a relative in the Holocaust\n\nMs Halpern-Matthews said the majority of worshippers at her synagogue lost a relative in the Holocaust.\n\nShe added: 'There are so many parallels with 1930s Germany now. The only was around this is for all of us to be upstanders and not bystanders to hatred. A boy told me that the other day. He was just 16.'\n\nSince the cemetery attack, the synagogue has received many messages of support from well wishers, including local mosque goers which was subject to an arson attack last week.\n\nMs Halpern-Matthews, who spoke at an anti-hate crime event last week, added: 'The way the religious community has reached out is quite heart warming really.\n\nPolice have stepped up patrols in the area since the attack which took place last month\n\n'And we have never seen so many messages of support our website. It's really important that we are standing together and supporting each other.'\n\nMegan Manson, of Gravesham Pagans, said: 'We are appalled that such a terrible act of anti-Semitism could happen here.\n\n'We stand in solidarity with the Jewish community and pray that we can all unite to defeat bigotry and hatred.'\n\nAjaib Hussain, co-chair of Medway Interfaith Action in Kent, said: 'I heard of the appalling vandalism at the synagogue cemetery and totally condemn these mindless acts of hate crime.\n\nDetectives are appealing for anyone with any information about the attack to come forward\n\n'Coming on Yom Kippur makes it even more disturbing on a holy day of prayers and remembrance.\n\n'I hope the perpetrators are caught quickly so that we can all feel safe and our loved ones, past and present, are respected.'\n\nPolice have stepped up patrols in the area since the attack and the community informs them of any services it has in advance.\n\nThe community only has 32 members and they will have to fundraise to raise the cash to improve site security.\n\nThe cemetery is located outside Chatham Memorial Synagogue in Rochester, Kent (file image)\n\nMs Halpern-Matthews added: 'I have never seen people so scared. We are a tiny community, we don't have the money to pay for security.\n\n'We left the gate unlocked so people could visit their relatives in the cemetery. That will change now. Visits will be by appointment only.'\n\nStephen Silverman, the Campaign Against Antisemitism investigations director, said: 'This cowardly act of vandalism must not go unpunished. We are grateful to Kent Police for their swift response.'\n\nDetectives are appealing for anyone with any information to come forward.", "description": "Headstones were upended, split and laying in tatters with a lone Star of David left on the gravel at Chatham Memorial Synagogue cemetery in Rochester, Kent.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028012-0-image-a-7_1571736186736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
