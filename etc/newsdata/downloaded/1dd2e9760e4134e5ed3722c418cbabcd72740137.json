This exquisite woman catches your eye, one of those high-cheeked beauties men were raised to revere and women were raised to emulate\u2014then envy. She soaks regally in a bathtub, her shoulder luridly exposed, the tub shielding the rest of her body. The scene is intimate, familiar, yet alluring: you see soap dishes, washcloths, faucets, a bathmat, the usual white grouting.\n\nBut you start processing anomalies. Amid this seemingly middle-class, mid-20th century setting, there\u2019s an aristocratic surprise: a small nude marble sculpture supervising the bather. It gets weirder. Eddies of dirt have blackened some of the bathmat, and the culprit is clear. This delicate model was wearing two combat boots standing in the foreground, with mud caked on their heels.\n\nTo the woman\u2019s right, an official portrait of Adolf Hitler slouches on the bathtub\u2019s ledge, providing the punchline. Lee Miller, a former model and ace wartime photographer, is in Adolf Hitler\u2019s bathtub, in Munich on April 30, 1945, the day he killed himself.", "description": "Discovered for her beauty when she was almost run over, Lee Miller went on to have one of the greatest careers that was later undermined by the horror she saw and experienced.", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492113163/articles/2016/05/21/the-dark-past-that-crippled-america-s-greatest-female-wartime-photographer/160520-troy-lee-miller-tease_mxvkvt", "published_at": "2016-05-21"}
