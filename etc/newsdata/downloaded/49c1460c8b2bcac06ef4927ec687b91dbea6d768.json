These players are currently pricing below the cost to serve, offering free delivery, or other deep discounts that are currently enabled by investor subsidies.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Domino\u2019s thinks that longer-term guidance is \u201cinstructive\u201d for investors while the shorter outlook provides \u201cmore meaningful\u201d guidance.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Domino\u2019s Pizza reported earnings and sales that missed expectations.\n\nSee: Impossible Burger couldn\u2019t be sold in supermarkets until company secured FDA approval of game-changing ingredient\n\n\u201cEven with softer-than-average results for the quarter, we believe the key focus point from the release will be management\u2019s decision to provide a slightly slower two-to-three-year growth outlook (compared with its traditional practice of a three-to-five-year plan), which is weighing on the shares premarket,\u201d wrote MKM Partners\u2019 Brett Levy prior to the earnings call.\n\nMKM rates Domino\u2019s Pizza shares neutral with a $265 price target.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza stock closed up 5.1% in regular Tuesday trading after falling 4% in premarket. The company announced a new $1 billion share buyback program on the conference call.\n\n\u201cThe lower growth targets and shorter time frame (two-to-three years versus three-to-five) are an acknowledgement that structural factors fundamentally changed the rate and composition of Domino\u2019s Pizza\u2019s growth,\u201d wrote Bernstein analysts.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: \u2018Totally bizarre!\u2019 -- nutritionists see red over study downplaying the health risks of red meat\n\n\u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza shares have lagged the market year-to-date and the multiple has compressed (though negative revisions have made the compression less pronounced than appeared). While growth targets have been reset, we think any inflection in fundamentals will require strategic shifts.\u201d\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza stock is up 2.2% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.56% has rallied 15.4%.\n\n\u201c[W]e\u2019re playing the long game at Domino\u2019s for our investors and most importantly for our franchisees,\u201d Allison said.", "description": "Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. says it\u2019s going to shorten its long-range outlook on some business metrics to two-to-three years from three-to-five years because the new...", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GL015_Domino_ZG_20180615142225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
