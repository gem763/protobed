Photo: Irving Haberman/Getty Images\n\nEver since the United States mistook a Twitter-addled con man\u2019s publicity stunt for a presidential campaign \u2014 and then elected him to our nation\u2019s highest office \u2014 calls for rethinking America\u2019s approach to democracy have been at the forefront of public debate.\n\nFor Democrats, Donald Trump\u2019s victory illustrated the importance of expanding popular sovereignty in the United States. After all, an America governed by majority rule would be one where Trump could never govern. The mogul\u2019s victory was not merely contingent on the Electoral College, but also on the low voter participation rates of America\u2019s poor, young, and nonwhite citizens. In a country where the non-voting public skews left, right-wing \u201cpopulism\u201d can\u2019t compete unless turnout skews elitist. Thus, to American liberals, the best prophylactic against future Trumps is more democracy \u2014 which is to say, reforms that expand the electorate and render the government more accountable to the will of electoral majorities. To that end, House Democrats made a package of democratic reforms \u2014 including nationwide automatic voter registration, a revamped Voting Rights Act, and a ban on partisan gerrymandering in federal elections \u2014 their first legislative priority upon taking power. Since then, the party\u2019s 2020 candidates have almost all unveiled their own platforms on democracy expansion.\n\nBut some took the opposite lesson from Trump\u2019s triumph. For one contingent of political observers, the reality star\u2019s victory seemed to be a symptom of too much democracy. After all, had the GOP\u2019s establishment elites been free to appoint their preferred standard-bearer, Trump would have gotten no closer to the nomination than his \u201cuniversity\u201d did to accreditation. And while Trump did lose the popular vote, he lost it by far less than one would hope, given his conspicuous lack of qualifications for high office. The peculiar ethnic and partisan dynamics of the U.S. might render Trump\u2019s specific brand of demagogy less viable under more majoritarian rules. But his ability to even compete highlighted a fundamental flaw in popular democracy, one that also enabled Brexit, and the rise of majoritarian right-wing nationalist movements throughout much of Europe and Asia: in the absence of expert guidance and mediating institutions, the ordinary voter is cognitively unfit for self-government.\n\nPolitico recently summarized UC Irvine political scientist Shawn Rosenberg\u2019s rendition of this argument:\n\nDemocracy is hard work. And as society\u2019s \u201celites\u201d \u2014 experts and public figures who help those around them navigate the heavy responsibilities that come with self-rule \u2014 have increasingly been sidelined, citizens have proved ill equipped cognitively and emotionally to run a well-functioning democracy \u2026\n\n[Democracy] requires a lot from those who participate in it. It requires people to respect those with different views from theirs and people who don\u2019t look like them. It asks citizens to be able to sift through large amounts of information and process the good from the bad, the true from the false. It requires thoughtfulness, discipline and logic. Unfortunately, evolution did not favor the exercise of these qualities in the context of a modern mass democracy.\n\nFor reasons cited above, I find the notion that the U.S. government is suffering from a surfeit of democracy to be unintelligible. But those who rage against the twilight of the elites do get one thing right: Good government does require institutions that mediate between voters and state.\n\nRosenberg is correct that democratic self-rule asks too much of the isolated individual. And other advocates for \u201cless democracy\u201d are right to question whether direct elections are always the most effective tools for elucidating the public interest. Sometimes referenda enhance responsive government by isolating voters\u2019 preferences on discrete policy issues from their broader partisan attachments (i.e., Medicaid expansion ballot measures are often a more reliable means of gauging public support for that policy in red states than legislative elections between pro- and anti-Medicaid expansion candidates). On policy questions that are abstruse or unfamiliar to the mass public, however, plebiscites may not empower \u201cthe people\u201d so much as they advantage whichever interested party has the most money to spend on propaganda.\n\nBut these facts say less about the deficiencies of democracy than they do about about the insufficiency of elections \u2014 by themselves \u2014 to produce popular self-rule. The alternative to naive faith in the omnicompetence of the individual voter need not be an equally naive faith in that of unelected technocrats. The most vital mediating institutions in a liberal democracy are not those formed by elites to check the irrational appetites of ordinary voters, but rather, those formed by ordinary voters to check the avarice of elites. Democracy asks too much of the individual. But if individuals organize collectively, they can force democracy to give them a better deal.\n\nWhich is a fancy way of saying: To repair American democracy \u2014 and fortify it against future threats \u2014 Democrats must not only bring more Americans into the electorate, but also, more American workers into labor unions.\n\nDemocracy begins at work.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong argument that giving ordinary Americans a say over how their workplaces are governed is just as fundamental to democracy as giving them the ballot.\n\nThese days, political liberty is often defined narrowly as the freedom to vote in fair elections. But in earlier eras of American history, genuine political freedom was thought to have a material component: To truly participate in self-government, one needed not only a voice in public affairs, but also a modicum of power in one\u2019s economic life. Franklin Roosevelt articulated this principle when introducing his economic bill of rights in 1944, telling Congress, \u201cWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.\u201d This sentiment might have struck some of FDR\u2019s fellow \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d as un-American. But the notion that self-government is impossible without a degree of economic autonomy was common among our republic\u2019s founding generation. The historian Terry Bouton writes of America\u2019s original grassroots revolutionaries:\n\n[M]any Pennsylvanians believed that economic equality was what made political equality possible. They were convinced that \u201cthe people\u201d would never have political liberty until citizens had the economic wherewithal to protect their rights. To them, concentrations of wealth and power led to corruption and tyrannical rulers, while widely dispersed political and economic power promoted good government.\n\n\u2026 Farmers and artisans declared that the Revolution was about \u201cthe freemen of this Country\u201d stating that \u201cthey do not esteem it the sole end of Government to protect the rich & powerful.\u201d \u2026 [G]overnment should promote the interests of \u201cthe mechanicks and farmers [who] constitute ninety-nine out of a hundred of the people of America.\u201d In short, the objective of the Revolution was bringing \u201cgentlemen men \u2026 down to our level\u201d and ensuring that \u201call ranks and conditions would come in for their just share of the wealth.\u201d\n\nThe revolution\u2019s elite architects had other objectives. But while they typically did not believe that all white men (let alone, all people) were entitled to political liberty, they agreed that one needed economic power to exercise such freedom. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, \u201cA power over man\u2019s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.\u201d\n\nIf we accept our founders\u2019 premises, then the true measure of a democracy \u2014 which is to say, a system of government in which all citizens enjoy political liberty \u2014 cannot merely be how many offices its people get to vote on. Rather, to gauge how democratic a society is, one must examine how much power ordinary citizens have over the terms of their own subsistence, and how evenly economic resources are dispersed across the demos. Judged on these terms, it is clear that the contemporary United States is the opposite of \u201cexcessively democratic\u201d \u2014 and that it will remain so, absent a revival of its labor movement.\n\nIn the founding era, classical republicans imagined that the great masses of ordinary (white male) Americans could attain the economic autonomy necessary for political liberty by becoming small landholders, or independent artisans. But the industrial revolution rendered that vision obsolete. Today, the vast majority of Americans are not self-employed, and spend the bulk of their waking hours answering to bosses who have power over their subsistence. In this context, most workers can only secure a degree of control over their economic lives by organizing collectively to check the power of their employers. Which is to say, they can only do so by forming unions.\n\nThat trade unions do, in fact, increase their members\u2019 power over their own working lives is confirmed by the wage and benefits premiums that unionized workforces enjoy. But organized labor does not merely democratize individual firms; it also democratizes economic power throughout the economy. As America\u2019s private-sector unionization rate collapsed over the past half century, the middle-class\u2019 share of productivity gains went down with it. And a large body of economic research confirms that this is no mere correlation. When workers organize, they secure a voice within the \u201cprivate governments\u201d that rule their economic lives, and they (typically) use that voice to rationally advance their own material interests \u2014 which, most of the time, also advances the self-interest of most Americans (a.k.a. the public interest). In other words, by forming trade unions, ordinary citizens achieve much of what critics of democracy insist it can\u2019t deliver.\n\nThus, even if organized labor did nothing to increase voter participation, or the responsiveness of elected officials to popular demands, it would still serve an indispensable democratic function by fostering the material preconditions for popular self-government.\n\nUnions make electorates more representative.\n\nMany items on the Democratic Party\u2019s democracy reform agenda are aimed at making the American electorate look more like the American people. Automatic voter registration, a federal Election Day holiday, and felon enfranchisement are all aimed at reducing class and racial disparities in voter participation. And such reforms are laudable. But no plan for lifting America\u2019s low voter turnout rates is complete without a plan for boosting its piddling rate of unionization.\n\nAs the Center for American Progress (CAP) has noted, the U.S. states with the highest unionization rates also have the highest rates of voter turnout, and the same correlation holds between nations. And the political science literature suggests this is not coincidental. As David Madland and Nick Bunker wrote for CAP in 2012:\n\nA 1 percentage point increase in union density in a state increases voter turnout rates by 0.2 to 0.25 percentage points according to analysis by Benjamin Radcliff and Patricia Davis, political scientists at the University of Notre Dame and the State Department, respectively. In other words, if unionization were 10 percentage points higher during the 2008 presidential election, 2.6 million to 3.2 million more Americans would have voted.\n\nSimilarly, research by Roland Zullo, a labor studies professor at the University of Michigan, shows that self-described working-class citizens \u2014 whether unionized or not \u2014 are just as likely to vote as other citizens are when unions run campaigns in their congressional district. Yet when unions don\u2019t run campaigns, working-class citizens are 10.4 percent less likely to vote than other citizens.\n\nA similar pattern holds for communities of color. Voters of color are just as likely to vote as white voters in districts with union campaigns but are 9.3 percent less likely to vote in districts without campaigns.\n\nA 2018 study of the electoral impacts of so-called \u201cright to work\u201d (RTW) laws lend credence to these findings. Such laws undermine organized labor by allowing workers who join a unionized workplace to enjoy the benefits of a collective bargaining agreement without paying dues to the union that negotiated it. This encourages other workers to skirt their dues, which can then drain a union of the funds it needs to survive. On the plus side, such state-level right to work laws provided political scientists at Boston University, Columbia, and the Brookings Institution with a natural experiment to test the relationship between unionization and electoral outcomes. By examining how voter turnout changed before and after the passage of RTW in a given state\u2019s border counties \u2014 and comparing those shifts to the control group of adjacent counties in non-RTW states \u2014 researchers found that right to work laws are associated with 2 to 3 percent reduction in voter participation.\n\nSeparately, unions also appear to facilitate the kind of cross-racial civic solidarity that scholars like Rosenberg fear our species may be evolutionarily ill-equipped to achieve. Although the American labor movement has often been a bastion of white supremacy \u2014 one that channeled the \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d of white male workers into causes like the Chinese Exclusion Act \u2014 it was also at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement, and helped to keep the bulk of white workers in the Midwest in a partisan coalition with African-Americans for decades after backlash politics painted the non-union South red. According to that 2018 study, the passage of right to work laws is associated with a 3.5 percent drop in the Democratic Party\u2019s share of the presidential vote. Which is to say: Had tea party governments not passed such measures in Wisconsin and Michigan, it\u2019s plausible that the union movements in those states would have kept a critical mass of white non-college voters from chasing the siren song of white identity politics in 2016.\n\nThe proletariat needs lobbyists, too.\n\nOne testament to American democracy\u2019s dysfunction is the cartoonish incompetence of its commander-in-chief. A less conspicuous \u2014 but more consequential \u2014 one is the chasm between popular preferences and public policy. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to prioritize tax relief for corporate shareholders over new spending on infrastructure, public education, health-insurance subsidies, or addiction treatment in the middle of a historic drug overdose epidemic didn\u2019t merely buck majoritarian opinion among Americans writ large, but also, among self-identified Republicans. And the same can be said of the White House\u2019s prioritization of various polluters\u2019 profit margins over the cleanliness of America\u2019s air and water, or Congress\u2019 perennial prioritization of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s profitability over the affordability of prescription drugs, or the myriad other ways that well-heeled interest groups overrule the bipartisan consensus of ordinary Americans in opinion polls.\n\nOne could attribute such policy outcomes to the median voter\u2019s failure to meet democracy\u2019s heavy demands; her struggle to sift through large amounts of information, and refusal to sacrifice her limited free time to the obligations of civic engagement. But the average American worker \u2014 and typical American CEO \u2014 are each working with the same archaic evolutionary hardware. The fact that the latter has proven so much more adept at using democratic freedoms to advance her interest is a function of resources, not psychobiology.\n\nInfluencing elections and legislative processes requires investments of time, money, and attention. Wealthy individuals and corporations can easily shoulder such expenses; ordinary voters can\u2019t. For this reason, if the average House member betrays the interests of the oil company based in her district, she will see her voice-mail box fill up, and campaign coffers empty out; if she betrays her median constituent\u2019s avowed desire to see carbon pollution more tightly regulated, by contrast, said voter probably won\u2019t even notice.\n\nThis simple reality \u2014 that economic power is easily converted into the political variety \u2014 is an inherent constraint on popular sovereignty in all capitalist democracies. But trade unions help to mitigate it, both by reducing inequalities in economic power (as we\u2019ve already seen), and by enabling working-class voters to collectivize the costs of political engagement.\n\nOf course, voters do not all interpret the world as vulgar Marxists would prefer. Class interests do not always map onto policy preferences. Nevertheless, there are some areas where majoritarian opinion across developed countries is quite consistent: Working people of all stripes tend to like it when the rich pay steeper taxes than they do. Meanwhile, as a general matter, most Americans also tend to evince support for increasing spending on the social safety net (although individual transfer programs can be unpopular). And U.S. states with high unionization rates do tend to have more progressive systems of taxation, and more generous levels of social provision.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Democratic Party\u2019s top 2020 candidates have unveiled ambitious proposals for eroding legal obstacles to union formation and labor militancy in the United States. Many have separately released plans for fortifying American democracy. Given the broad public support for the objective of rolling back plutocracy \u2014 and the centrality of organized labor to actually realizing that goal \u2014 Democrats should make clear that the projects of reviving the union movement and restoring \u201cgood government\u201d are one in the same.", "description": "Strengthening unions should be at the heart of any agenda for reviving American democracy because labor\u2019s weakness is at the heart of its decline.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/11/11-union-democracy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
