He encourages parents and teachers to use simple conversation with kids to talk about why they're proud of being black.\n\nThat said, it's important to teach children about slavery \"before they can be miseducated and traumatized,\" said Jody Lynn Allen, a historian at The College of William & Mary. One of Allen's godsons learned about slavery in fourth grade and did not want to go back to class.\n\nSome schools do a terrible job: Runaway-slave games. Sanitized textbooks. Slavery as taught in our schools\n\n\"I talked to him, helping him to understand that there is no shame in being the offspring of enslaved people. Indeed, they were strong, resilient and rebellious,\" Allen said. \"To paraphrase Jawanza Kunjufu, I told him that we are 'the offspring of the ancestors who would not die.' He went back to school. He is now a college graduate, and he is fierce.\"\n\nFor educators, University of Alabama historian Joshua Rothman has one major tip: Don't do reenactments or turn slavery into a game.\n\n\"There is almost no way to do these sorts of activities in ways that are sensitive both to the past and to the experiences of the students in a classroom,\" Rothman said.\n\nBooks for middle school children:\n\n\"To Be a Slave\" by Julius Lester and Tom Feelings (2000)\n\n\"Frederick Douglass: The Lion Who Wrote History\" by Walter Dean Myers and Floyd Cooper (2017)\n\n\"Heart and Soul: The Story of America and African Americans\" by Kadir Nelson (2013)\n\nBooks for younger children:\n\n\"Under the Freedom Tree\" by Susan VanHecke.
