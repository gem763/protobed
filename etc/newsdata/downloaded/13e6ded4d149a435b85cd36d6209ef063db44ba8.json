Different groups can pick up the map and study it in more detail, read and interpret it.\"\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [SINGAPORE] Researchers in Singapore have created the world's largest genetic databank of Asian populations, which could help scientists and doctors better diagnose rare diseases, find the causes of chronic ailments and help us better understand the country's history. .
