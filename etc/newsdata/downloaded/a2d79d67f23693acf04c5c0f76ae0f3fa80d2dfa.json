(Photo by Jeff Neira/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said Sunday he would cooperate the House impeachment inquiry, but only if directed by his client.\n\nTrump, according to a memo of his July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and an anonymous whistleblower complaint, repeatedly pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and noted that Giuliani would be in contact with Ukraine on the probe.\n\n\"Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy,\" Trump told Zelensky. \"I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General [William] Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nThe investigation was based on a dubious claim that, as vice president in 2016, Biden pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to oust a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board starting in 2014, where he received a monthly salary of $50,000.\n\nWhile Joe Biden did call for the prosecutor\u2019s removal, he was one of many international leaders who did so in response to concerns about corruption, a fact that undercuts Giuliani\u2019s claim that Biden acted in his son\u2019s interests. The investigation into Burisma had been closed prior to the vice president calling for the prosecutor\u2019s ouster, Bloomberg News reported. In fact, in late 2014, the Obama administration pressed the Ukrainians to assist the U.K. in a separate investigation into Burisma\u2019s owner.\n\nYet, despite the lack of evidence, Giuliani began pressing the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens' role in the prosecutor\u2019s firing earlier this year and has maintained his argument that there was wrongdoing on behalf of the Bidens.\n\nGiuliani was named \u201ca central figure\u201d in Trump\u2019s effort to use \u201cthe power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d according to the released whistleblower complaint against the president for his dealings with Ukraine and allegedly withholding almost $400 million in military aid from the country as leverage for a probe into the Bidens. Giuliani could be one of the potential witnesses Democrats in the six House committees involved in the investigation may seek to interview, as they are said to be eyeing a fast-paced impeachment inquiry, which officially began last week.\n\nAs Senate Democrats came out in support of the inquiry, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin said Tuesday there\u2019s an expectation that the \u201cTrump White House will stonewall\u201d congressional investigators.\n\n\u201cAre you going to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee?\u201d Giuliani was asked by ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d host George Stephanopoulos.\n\n\u201cThat is a question that has a lot of implications to it,\u201d Giuliani responded. \u201cBelieve it or not, I'm an attorney. Everything I did was to defend my client. I am proud of what I did. And I am proud of having uncovered what will turn out to be a massive pay-for-play scheme, not unlike the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nWhen Giuliani started to discuss looking into \u201cplaces that Hunter Biden went to sell his father's office,\u201d Stephanopoulos asked again if he would cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't cooperate with [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI think Adam Schiff should be removed. If they remove Adam Schiff, if they put a neutral person in, who hasn't prejudged the case, if they put someone in, a Democrat who hasn't expressed an opinion yet \u2014 if I had a judge in the case and he had already announced I'm going to impeach, if he already went ahead and did a whole false episode, wouldn't I move to recuse that judge?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that's your answer, you're not going to cooperate?\u201d Stephanopoulos pressed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Giuliani pushed back. \u201cI said I would consider it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to be guided by my client, frankly,\u201d he continued. \u201cI'm a lawyer. It's his privilege, not mine. If he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I'll testify, even though I think Adam Schiff is an illegitimate chairman. He has already prejudged the case.\u201d\n\nGiuliani added: \u201cIf we want fairness here, we've got to put somebody in charge of that committee who has an open mind, not someone who wants to hang the president.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said Sunday he would cooperate the House impeachment inquiry, but only if directed by his client.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hKeP6knQuXqJuRawY9bPvQ--~B/aD0yMzk1O3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6cc35390-e2e1-11e9-be91-11481d814271", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
