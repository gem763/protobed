But as soon as the game ended, KTVU broadcast a headline that some found offensive:\n\n@KTVU I'm disappointed in you, could you be any more culturally insensitive\u2026\n\n\"Braves Scalped\"\u2026 REALLY!???! pic.twitter.com/Gi0xdnLBCI \u2014 JerseyJenn (@JerseyJenn) October 10, 2019\n\nEven the Braves were working to head off charges of racism by announcing ahead of the game, that they would not allow foam tomahawks or the team\u2019s \u201ctomahawk chop\u201d tradition during the series.\n\nDespite the team\u2019s effort to PC itself, KTVU \u201cwent there,\u201d anyway.\n\nNaturally, the complaints flooded the Internet.\n\nFor instance, Sporting News slammed the TV station saying, \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely zero reason to ever use a headline like this, but considering Helsley already called both the tomahawk chop offensive during this exact series, this headline is at least in poor taste.\u201d\n\nOthers also dumped on the TV station. Yahoo Sports called the caption, \u201ca facepalm-worthy racially insensitive headline.\u201d Sports Illustrated deemed the caption a flat out \u201cracist headline.\u201d And Awful Announcing screamed that the caption was \u201d at minimum tasteless and is racist and/or culturally insensitive.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of detractors on Twitter, as well:\n\nMan, I can\u2019t believe the kind of stuff they put on TV back in the\u2026 OMG THAT\u2019S FROM TONIGHT SERIOUSLY SO BAD. pic.twitter.com/MXUWYVvHIU \u2014 Marc Carig (@MarcCarig) October 10, 2019\n\nHey @KTVU, anyone who saw this headline before it aired should be fired. https://t.co/8Ei9OziNai \u2014 Caleb Turrentine (@CalebTurrentine) October 10, 2019\n\nLook at this garbage from @KTVU in San Francisco. How do people get away from this racist crap in 2019.https://t.co/vB4nTAHNOC \u2014 Mike Wise (@MikeWiseguy) October 10, 2019\n\nThe station eventually apologized for the caption.\n\n\u201cWednesday evening, in our 6 p.m. newscast, we had a story about the Atlanta Braves that included a phrase that was racially insensitive toward Native Americans. It was not our intention to offend anyone, and we want to express our deepest apologies for the use of that phrase,\u201d the station tweeted.\n\nWednesday evening, in our 6 p.m. newscast, we had a story about the Atlanta Braves that included a phrase that was racially insensitive toward Native Americans.
