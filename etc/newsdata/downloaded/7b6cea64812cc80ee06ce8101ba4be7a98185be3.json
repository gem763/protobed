The Sunday Times reported that Johnson is preparing to grant Huawei access to the \u201cnon-contentious\u201d parts of the 5G network, and Reuters reported this month that a new German security rule book would not exclude Huawei.\n\nIn May, Trump signed a long-awaited executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The order directed the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October. The Commerce Department has yet to publish a plan.\n\nThe U.S. government blacklisted Huawei in May, saying the Chinese company was involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security.\n\nCongress has been considering legislation to authorize up to $1 billion for small and rural wireless providers to replace network equipment from companies, including Huawei and ZTE Corp <000063.SZ>, that lawmakers say pose a national security risk.\n\nAbout a dozen rural U.S. telecom carriers that depend on inexpensive Huawei and ZTE switches and equipment were in discussions with Ericsson <ERICb.ST> and Nokia <NOKIA.HE> to replace their Chinese equipment, Reuters reported in June.\n\nIn April 2018, the Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to advance new rules to bar the use of funds from a government program to purchase equipment or services from companies, including Huawei, that pose a security threat to U.S. communications networks. A person briefed on the matter said the FCC could vote on the final rules as early as November.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Alison Williams and Steve Orlofsky)", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said in a letter Monday the United States plans to cooperate with \"like-minded nations\" to promote security in next-generation 5G networks.
