Inmates repeatedly had access to rifles, handguns, and drugs.\n\nKnown as the Topo Chico prison, state officials recently closed the 76-year-old facility and repurposed it for office space. In 2016, the prison made headlines after Los Zetas clashed with rival inmates, killing 49.\n\nAfter the closure, rumors of inmates buried or incinerated inside the compound reached Mexico\u2019s Federal Undersecretary for Human Rights, who sent cadaver dogs and forensic specialists to investigate.\n\nA law enforcement official revealed to Breitbart Texas that Los Zetas managed to recruit guards and supervisors to create an intelligence and communications operation which fostered full control of the grounds. As part of a lucrative extortion effort, Los Zetas would gather information on an inmate\u2019s family and threaten them if fees were not paid.\n\nInside, authorities uncovered proper weaponry and evidence of access to high-end liquor, drugs, and women.\n\nBreitbart Texas previously reported on a similar case where Los Zetas obtained control of the prison Piedras Negras and disposed of more than 150 bodies. The organization used 55-gallon drums to incinerate their victims.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
