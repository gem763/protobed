The new titles include a card game, a fighting game, multiplayer online battle arena game, open-world game and an esports simulator, seemingly akin to the Football Manager franchise.\n\nThe non-League-based title is code-named \u201cProject A\u201d and is being described as a tactical shooter game that will be set on Earth.\n\nNew games from Riot have been widely expected by its fans and industry observers for many years, even as the company\u2019s 10 year-old flagship title still sees a peak of about 8 million concurrent players daily, according to a September announcement from the company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have the benefit of being able to be long term,\" Marc Merrill, co-founder of the Riot Games, said to The Washington Post. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go push out a product to meet some quarterly deadline or revenue target or whatnot.\u201d Riot is owned by Tencent, a Chinese technology and entertainment conglomerate.\n\nMerrill said that the long gap before Riot\u2019s new offerings has been due to a confluence of factors, including a constant evaluation process in light of ongoing development in the rapidly-evolving video game industry. He brought up Hearthstone, a massively popular card game based on Blizzard\u2019s Warcraft series, as a reason his team reevaluated Riot\u2019s card game offering, which Merrill said has been in the works for eight years and has \u201cgone through multiple starts and stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to adjust how we were doing things,\u201d Merrill said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMichael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, believes the new games will buoy Riot\u2019s revenue, owing to the League of Legends audience, which extends to the hundreds of millions, if all the game\u2019s players over the years are included.\n\n\u201cTheir competitive advantage is the huge number of League of Legends fans,\u201d he said. He is skeptical about their tactical shooter, however.\n\n\u201cAs they expand beyond their core competencies, the risk profile goes up a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s doing a steakhouse.\u201d\n\nMerrill said the tactical shooter will attempt to build deeper characters and worlds\n\ncompared to current games on the market, as well as add \u201cbroader avenues for strategic depth and expression.\u201d Riot has not revealed a release date for that game.\n\nAD\n\nRiot\u2019s League-based card game, called Legends of Runterra, will introduce new League of Legends characters and allow players to directly acquire cards, as opposed to relying on luck through randomized packs. It is scheduled for PC and mobile next year.\n\nAD\n\nAn existing League of Legends mode, called Teamfight Tactics, which is like auto chess mixed with a last-player standing \u201cbattle royale\u201d game, will be available on mobile next year. The MOBA game, League of Legend: Wild Rift will feature 5-on-5 gameplay and will be available to play on mobile next year. Riot did not announce when it will be available on consoles.\n\nThe fighting game, code-named \u201cProject L,\u201d is in \u201cearly-stage development.\u201d \u201cProject F\u201d is the open world game. Riot offered scant details related to those games.\n\nThe developments today follow a period in which the company faced a series of issues brought to light by the media and legal action. First came a report from Kotaku and a class-action lawsuit over claims of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The lawsuit was settled last August, though Riot said in a blog post that, \u201cWe can confidently state that gender discrimination (in pay or promotion), sexual harassment, and retaliation are not systemic issues at Riot.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver 100 Riot employees staged a walk out last May over contract clauses requiring arbitration. Riot said the company will give employees the option to opt-out of that clause after the current round of litigation is completed.\n\nAlong with the video game announcements, the Los Angeles-based company also marked its entry into Hollywood. \u201cArcane\u201d is an animated series that was produced in-house and focuses on two characters from League of Legends. Another new offering, \u201cLeague of Legends Origins,\" is a feature-length documentary by Academy Award-nominated director Leslie Iwerks. It details how the game and its community have grown over the years.\n\nUntil now, Riot\u2019s status as a single-game maker \u2014 Merrill referenced an internal joke that labeled the company \u201cRiot Game\u201d \u2014 stood in marked contrast its competition at Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard, which put out multiple, high-profile games every year.\n\n\u201cOne of the differences between Riot and Blizzard is that, in my understanding, Blizzard loves to make games in terms of being epic,\" Merrill said, adding that grew up playing Blizzard games. \"If Riot were to have a word to describe us, it would be \u2018authentic,\u2019 and good at valuing the things that matter most to our players and not doing a bunch of things that, it doesn\u2019t really matter. And I\u2019m not saying Blizzard does that, but we\u2019re trying to be very focused.\u201d\n\nNow the company is poised to expand its gaze.\n\n\u201cWe always looked at League of Legends as step one for the company,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The League of Legends creator is adding several new titles, some as soon as 2020.", "authors": ["Noah Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6nB5EsPIW2oY2wUkUPb0-tRdJYw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KTXYVEWT5RGWVJ5EWCDIPBGUJQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
