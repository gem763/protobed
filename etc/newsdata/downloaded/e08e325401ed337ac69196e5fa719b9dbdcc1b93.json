Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThe Trump administration is also making a once-unthinkable concession in its proposal: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are here to stay.\n\nThe housing giants have lingered under government control for more than a decade after receiving more than $100 billion in taxpayer bailouts to shore up the housing market. Lawmakers squabbled for years about their fates, with Republicans repeatedly calling for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be abolished.\n\nIn a 2018 editorial in the Wall Street Journal, then-Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), chairman of the Financial Services Committee at the time, called for the companies, which back half the country\u2019s housing market, to be replaced. \u201cThe new system we envision would be based on private capital, competition, innovation, consumer choice and market discipline,\" he said.\n\nInstead, the Treasury Department unveiled a sweeping plan this week that recommends returning the massive companies to private hands.\n\n\u201cBoth in the Obama administration and during periods of bipartisan negotiations the focus was on whiteboarding a totally new system,\" said David M. Dworkin, who was a senior adviser in the Treasury Department on housing finance during the Obama and Trump administrations. \u201cIt is too hard. The current system is too embedded and the unintended consequences are too unpredictable.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the housing reports submitted Thursday by the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development and how it could affect you.\n\nHow could the administration\u2019s proposals affect consumers?\n\nThe Trump administration says its proposals aim to protect the availability of the 30-year mortgage and support affordable housing throughout the country. But housing advocates warn that some proposals could raise mortgage rates and make it harder for some people to obtain a mortgage.\n\nThe plan, for example, calls for eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s affordable housing goals and replacing them with a fee paid to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The goals \u201cshould be replaced with a more efficient, transparent, and accountable mechanism for delivering tailored support,\u201d the Treasury Department\u2019s report says.\n\nBut fees paid by the companies would inevitably be absorbed into HUD\u2019s budget rather than going directly to help low-income borrowers, said Dworkin, chief executive of the National Housing Conference. \u201cThe net result would be zero. In fact, it would be less than zero, because it would make the housing affordability crisis the report acknowledges even worse,\u201d he said.\n\n[How Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac dodged a $600,000 cap on CEO pay]\n\nWhat areas of the country are most likely to be affected?\n\nWhile the proposals generally deal with the national housing market, some could affect people in cities that have rent-control laws in place. According to the Urban Institute, there are 183 municipalities with some form of rent control, with nearly all in New Jersey and New York. (Cities in Maryland and California, as well as the District, also have rent control.)\n\nThe report questions whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be backing loans in jurisdictions with rent-control laws. The administration urges the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to \u201crevisit \u2026 underwriting criteria\u201d for loans on multifamily properties where rent-control laws \u201cor other undue impediments to housing development\u201d are in place.\n\nThe report indicates those actions could be done administratively, meaning approval from Congress wouldn\u2019t be needed.\n\nThat is another non-starter, Dworkin said. \u201cHow on earth do conservatives accept government making entire parts of the economy unavailable to cities that do things they don\u2019t like?\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire city of New York would not be able to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac financing for anything. It\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d\n\nWhy is this proposal happening now?\n\nThis week marks the 11th anniversary of the government seizing control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the housing market unraveled and the firms\u2019 losses piled up.\n\nBoth companies play a critical part in the housing market, buying mortgages from lenders, then packaging them into securities to sell to investors. They back more than half the country\u2019s mortgages, providing key market support.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have long agreed that the companies shouldn\u2019t be kept in government conservatorship indefinitely but have struggled to come up with a solution, fearful that a wrong move could disrupt the housing market and the availability of 30-year mortgages.\n\nOne major difference now, industry and housing advocates say, is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. In addition to being a former Goldman Sachs banker, Mnuchin also used to run a regional bank and is familiar with the mortgage market. In 2009, Mnuchin led the purchase of failed subprime mortgage lender IndyMac, the California bank whose long lines of customers waiting to withdraw their money became an enduring image of the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cMnuchin understands mortgage markets and wants his legacy to include a role in ending the [Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac] purgatory of the past decade,\u201d Charles Gabriel, an analyst with Washington-based research firm Capital Alpha Partners, said in a research note.\n\nHow likely is this to pass Congress?\n\nMany of the 49 proposals could be accomplished through administrative action by federal agencies while others need approval from Congress.\n\nRepublicans praised the reports as a road map to completing a complicated task that, they note, the Obama administration failed to do.\n\n\u201cEleven years after being bailed out and put into conservatorship, it is time to make the hard decisions and strengthen our housing finance system,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nCrapo unveiled a proposal that mirrors many of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earlier this year and has scheduled a hearing next week that will include Mnuchin, Mark Calabria, the head of FHFA, and HUD Secretary Ben Carson.\n\nBut there are several potential speed bumps to passing such significant legislation anytime soon. Democrats in the House are unlikely to consider legislation that might alter Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s affordable housing goals, for example. And lawmakers may not want to wade into such politically fraught waters so close to the next election.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no viable window for comprehensive mortgage finance reform legislation in this Congress,\u201d Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, said in a research note.\n\nWhat happens if Congress can\u2019t reach a deal?\n\nTrump\u2019s proposals include several measures that could be tackled without Congress.\n\nEven if Congress fails to act, Calabria has significant leeway to start the process of releasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control, potentially putting pressure on reluctant lawmakers.\n\nCalabria, for example, could start by allowing Fannie and Freddie to retain more capital in preparation for becoming viable private companies again. He could also, as the Trump administration recommends, end the practice of the Treasury Department collecting most of the companies\u2019 profits.\n\nOver the past decade, Fannie Mae has received $119.8 billion in taxpayer bailouts, with Freddie Mac receiving $71.6 billion. But as they returned to profitability, the companies have sent a combined $300 billion in dividends to the Treasury Department.\n\nWhat about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s shareholders?\n\nDespite being in government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s stocks still trade on public markets \u2014 at a fraction of their previous value.\n\nThese shareholders remain in limbo under the Trump plan but retain some hope for a big payoff. If the companies are released from government control, their stock price could jump, allowing some investors to potentially lock in profits.\n\nFor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors, \u201cthe outlook seems confirmingly positive, albeit with uncertainty for timetable and crucial tumblers\u2019 falling into place,\u201d said Gabriel, of Capital Alpha Partners.\n\nAmong those watching the issue most closely are the hedge funds and other investors who have spent years lobbying the White House and Capitol Hill to rescind the companies\u2019 government conservatorship. In particular, Wall Street has been vexed that both companies send their profits to the Treasury rather than sharing them with shareholders.\n\n\u201cThere is a hope that since the government got so much back that they will recapitalize Fannie and Freddie and allow the shareholders to receive what they deserve and what every other shareholder in every other financial enterprise has received,\u201d hedge fund billionaire John Paulson said in a rare interview with the \u201cAccording to Sources\u201d podcast in January.\n\nShareholders in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, himself included, have not received a dividend in 10 years, said Paulson, best known for making a $15 billion bet against the housing market and is among Trump\u2019s biggest supporters on Wall Street. \u201cShareholders have been absolutely destroyed,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s proposals envisions a smaller role for the government in the housing market, but leaves it to lawmakers and regulators to figure out many of the details.", "authors": ["Renae Merle", "Reporter Covering White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street", "September At Pm", "Renae Merle Covers White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street For The Washington Post.
