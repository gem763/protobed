Markey (D-MA) and Rob Wyden (D-OR) all signed their names on the letter, which was addressed to USDOT Secretary Elaine Chao \u201cover concerns about potentially anticompetitive and anti-consumer behavior among airlines that may be suppressing consumer ability to make informed flight decisions.\u201d\n\nThe complaint, which essentially accuses the department of deceptive business practices, states that back in Oct. 2016, the Department of Transportation received an RFI which expressed concern over airline companies\u2019 restricting consumer access to flight information and wielding an unfair and oppressive monopoly over the industry.\n\nThe DOT suspended that request in March 2017, under the pretense that the department needed to \u201callow the President\u2019s appointees the opportunity to review and consider\u201d the Request for Information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since that suspension was put in place, and yet the RFI remains suspended, according to the senators\u2019 letter.\n\nAs the DOT malingers regarding the request, the letter states that consumers have been forced to rely on third-party price comparison websites in order to select the best option for their flying needs, and levies an accusation against the department that \u201csome airlines appear to be taking steps to restrict consumer access\u201d to such websites.\n\nThe letter specifically calls out Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines for restricting access to their flight information and prices from online travel agents and third-party price comparison travel websites.\n\nThe letter \u201crespectfully requests a response by September 20, 2019.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Five U.S. senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, sent a letter to the USDOT urging the department to lift a two-year long suspension of an RFI accusing them of deceptive business practices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/delayed-flight-arline-airport_large-b7f31a6f8fddb510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
