Today the price of Bitcoin dropped to $7,448.75, down from around $8,000 earlier in the day.\n\nInvestors aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s behind the crash, but Bitcoin\u2019s commentariat pointed to two likely culprits.\n\nOne was the underwhelming performance of Facebook\u2019s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in testimony before Congress on the Libra cryptocurrency that his company is leading the charge to create.\n\nHowever, an underwhelming performance from Zuckerberg and the potential fate of Libra, which cryptocurrency purists have scoffed at anyway, may be less concerning for the Bitcoin crowd than developments happening in Google\u2019s quantum computing research labs around the world.\n\nEarlier today, Google declared quantum dominance, indicating that it had solved a problem using quantum computing that a supercomputer would have taken years to solve. That\u2019s great news for theoretical physicists and quantum computing aficionados, but less good for investors who\u2019ve put their faith (and billions of dollars) into a system of record whose value depends on its inability to be cracked by computing power.\n\nWhen news of Google\u2019s achievement first began trickling out in late September (thanks to reporting by the Financial Times), Bitcoin experts dismissed the notion that it would cause problems for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s possible to scale quantum computers; quite possible that adding qbits will have an exponential cost,\u201d wrote early Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, on Twitter.\n\nIt means nothing because Google's quantum breakthrough is for a primitive type of quantum computing that is nowhere near breaking cryptography. We still don't even know if it's possible to scale quantum computers; quite possible that adding qbits will have an exponential cost. https://t.co/wSmO6ycaJk \u2014 Peter Todd (@peterktodd) September 24, 2019\n\nThe comments, flagged by CoinTelegraph, seem to indicate that the economic cost of cracking Bitcoin\u2019s cryptography is far beyond the means of even Alphabet\u2019s multibillion-dollar budgets.\n\nStill, it has been a dark few months for cryptocurrencies after steadily surging throughout the year. The real test, of course, of the viability of Bitcoin and the other cryptographically secured transaction mechanisms floating around the tech world these days is whether anyone will build viable products on their open architectures.\n\nAside from a few flash-in-the-pan fads, the jury is very much still out on what the verdict will be.\n\nThat uncertainty affects more than just Bitcoin, and, indeed, the rest of the market also tumbled, as Coindesk pricing charts indicate.", "description": "The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tanked today, continuing a months-long slide that has seen the value of the digital currency slide by more than $2,000 from highs of above $10,000 earlier in the year.
