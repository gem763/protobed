ET employs about 5,000 staff in Germany.\n\nThe sale or listing of ET forms the core of a plan that new CEO Martina Merz must quickly implement to turn around the stricken conglomerate's fortunes following four profit warnings and two botched restructurings.\n\nIG Metall's Hofmann also lashed out at Finland's Kone <KNEBV.HE>, whose CEO has expressed interest in a deal, but said earlier this week he might divest Thyssenkrupp assets to address possible antitrust concerns.\n\n\"I don't like it at all when Kone, being one of numerous interested parties, already openly speculates about divesting parts of TK Elevator. That's certainly not a good offer to employees,\" Hofmann said.\n\nMarkus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and trade secretary at IG Metall, also said that workers would not accept that ET be torn apart. \"This also applies to Kone,\" he said.\n\n\"In our basic agreement with management we have clearly established that any bidder must strike an agreement with us before a signing takes place. That's not negotiable,\" Grolms said, adding any buyer must present a future plan for the unit.\n\nOther possible bidders include Hitachi <6501.T>, Brookfield <BAMa.TO>, CVC, Hellman & Friedman, a tie-up of Blackstone <BX.N> and Carlyle <CG.O> as well as a consortium consisting of Advent, Cinven and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\n\n($1 = 0.9027 euros)\n\n(Writing by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Douglas Busvine)", "description": "DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Top representatives at IG Metall, Germany's biggest union, will not approve a sale of Thyssenkrupp's <TKAG.DE> prized elevator division unless potential buyers give far-reaching concessions to employees, they said.", "authors": ["Tom K\u00e4ckenhoff"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
