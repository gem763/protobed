We are youth, parents and grandparents. And we are all afraid of what the climate and ecological emergency will bring to you and your loved ones if the government doesn\u2019t act now.\n\nThat\u2019s why Extinction Rebellion has returned to London. We\u2019ve blocked roads and locations across Westminster because it\u2019s the only way we can think of to get the government to take notice and act after years of policy making that simply doesn\u2019t touch the sides when it comes to the action that\u2019s needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need to end the fallacy that those of us living in developed economies like the UK will somehow be spared the impacts of climate change already devastating lives elsewhere.\n\nScientists\u2019 warnings about disappearing glaciers and sea-level rise can feel too distant and remote when envisaged for the years 2050 or 2100. It\u2019s why for over three decades, the climate and ecological crisis just hasn\u2019t felt like one for most people in London.\n\nIn this Rebellion we\u2019ll also be drawing attention to nearer-term threats that are frankly even more terrifying (Picture: Ben Stansall/AFP)\n\nIn this Rebellion we\u2019ll also be drawing attention to nearer-term threats that are frankly even more terrifying.\n\nSome of us are preparing to go on hunger strike to illustrate the likelihood that our supermarkets will fail us because the food system is too fragile to continually withstand the shocks of extreme weather happening in other parts of the world.\n\nAnd as this week unfolds, you\u2019ll hopefully hear about a series of peaceful actions in different parts of the capital that will demonstrate, in the clearest and strongest terms.\n\nThere will also be a sit-in protest to close City Airport from Thursday, which we hope will demonstrate the absurdity of expanding air travel at a time when carbon emissions from planes need to be radically cut in line with scientific warnings.\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion environmental activists being placed under arrest in London Picture: Getty)\n\nWe don\u2019t take our actions lightly. We have been in discussions for months with the police and emergency services about precisely what we are planning so as to ensure Londoners and people joining us remain safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, any emergency within the blockaded area will be accessible to the emergency services. And to minimise disruption, we offered to work with Transport for London to help divert buses, and took it upon ourselves to post advance warnings at impacted bus stops.\n\nAnd of course, our actions are entirely non-violent, not least because historically speaking, non-violent civil disobedience is effective.\n\nAbove all, we have returned to the capital because we are afraid and vulnerable. By admitting this to ourselves and to each other, something wonderful can happen \u2013 something that we at Extinction Rebellion want to share with all Londoners, and that is a rebirthing of community and care for one another.\n\nThere will be a dizzying display of arts and performances to highlight visions and voices about what our future could be like, if only the government would act. This is a future where our cultures are resilient, regenerative and built on respect for one another, all other forms of life, and the planet that sustains us. A future where we survive.\n\nRebellion is for all of us, so please, join us at some point over the next two weeks. Bring your family to the XR Families site next to Admiralty Arch or join us in contemplation and prayer at the newly unveiled Faith Bridge (formerly Lambeth Bridge).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe weather won\u2019t wait for our politics, so Extinction Rebellion is demanding government cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and set up a citizens\u2019 assembly to agree how to make that happen. That\u2019s what a successful rebellion will look like.\n\nIt will be of course be a massive step, and we are not naive about how far there is to go. But then do Londoners really want to go to hell in a hybrid?\n\nMarc Lopatin is an Extinction Rebellion activist\n\nMORE: Who are the Red Brigade who silently appear at Extinction Rebellion protests?\n\nMORE: Scuffles in central London and 135 arrested during Extinction Rebellion protest\n\nMORE: Man chains himself to hearse steering wheel in Extinction Rebellion protest", "description": "A Extinction Rebellion protester tells Metro.co.uk why the protests are back in London", "authors": ["Marc Lopatin"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88798960_1570469585.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
