The Bathurst 1000 is a 1000km car race held annually on the Mount Panorama Circuit, in Bathurst, NSW. Drivers compete for about 6.5 hours, completing 161 laps around a 6.123km circuit.\n\n'Some men still think women should speak on their command.\n\n'Jokes that reduce women to objects of ridicule and abuse is one of the drivers of violence against women.\n\n'What an absolute f**king disgrace, Australia. Surely it's time for men to stand against this crap.'\n\nMs Moody's post attracted almost 2,000 comments, which were divided between being appalled at the connotations of the picture and appreciating it as a joke.\n\nThe 1,000km race around Mount Panorama Circuit was held from Thursday October 10 to Sunday October 13\n\nDrivers compete for about 6.5 hours, completing 161 laps around a 6.123km circuit\n\n'Jokes perpetuating this toxicity among domestic partnerships are disgusting and should not be normalised and it really makes my blood boil when I know garbage like this circulates,' one woman said.\n\nOthers said the post is a direct reflection of where a 'historic objectification of women in sport takes us'.\n\n'There is always someone who needs to blow sh*t out of proportion, I understand the demeaning manner but there is no harm to this person... its a joke,' one man responded.\n\n'Motorsport is not in any way misogynistic, the amount of women in motorsport and mechanics that are doing amazing jobs is phenomenal. There is sexism in all aspects of life, this post from that page is very obviously a JOKE,' another wrote.\n\n'They don't genuinely want to tie up their girlfriends to watch a race, the woman in the photo obviously consented to this photo as she probably thought it to be funny as well.'\n\nLifeline: 13 1144\n\nNational Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence Counselling Service 24hr helpline: 1800 RESPECT", "description": "Hundreds of women expressed their disgust at the 'misogynistic' and 'disgraceful' image after it was shared online by domestic violence campaigner Sherele Moody.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760894-0-image-a-164_1571176133644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
