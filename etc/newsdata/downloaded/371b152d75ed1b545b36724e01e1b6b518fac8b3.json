There is zero evidence that anything like this happened. If a similar share of Republicans believed in a conspiracy to steal the presidential election, the media would treat it as a scandal, and the blame would fall squarely on the leaders leading GOPers down that crazy highway.\n\nBut the media just help this Looney Toons idea along. And they are more apt to do so in speculation over how Trump would handle a hypothetical election loss.\n\nIn May, CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza wrote a column headlined: \u201cWhat Happens If Donald Trump Refuses to Admit He Lost in 2020?\u201d Wrote Cillizza: \u201cSince the moment he won the White House in November 2016, Trump has shown a willingness \u2014 actually more of a proclivity \u2014 to entertain the idea that there is some sort of broad conspiracy aimed at trying to disenfranchise conservative voters.\u201d\n\nYet Hillary hasn\u2019t shown more than a mere proclivity to entertain a broad conspiracy \u2014 she\u2019s pushing the conspiracy theory on national television to sympathetic hosts. She\u2019s challenging the idea that Trump is the legitimate president of the United States to \u00admedia applause.
