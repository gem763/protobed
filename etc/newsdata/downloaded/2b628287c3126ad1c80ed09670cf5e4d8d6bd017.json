It told investors during its second-quarter earnings call in July that it was fundraising for a special situations fund.\n\nNew York-based KKR closed its first special situations fund after raising $2 billion from investors in 2014. Its second closed with $3.35 billion in 2016.\n\nSpecial situations funds invest in the bonds of companies about to go bankrupt, with hopes of earning substantial gains when the firms return to financial health.\n\nKKR's special situations investments include Gibson, a Nashville-based guitar manufacturer, and Telepizza, a pizza delivery company based in Madrid.\n\nU.S. private equity firms are expected to raise about $220 billion this year, according to data provider Pitchbook, as institutional investors continue to seek returns not available in public markets.\n\n(This story corrects \"situations\" to plural throughout.)", "description": "KKR seeks $1.5 billion for third special situations fund: sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF931LA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
