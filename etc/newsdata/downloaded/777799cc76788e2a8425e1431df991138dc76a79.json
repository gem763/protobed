It earlier this year agreed to acquire Alliance Data Systems Corp.'s marketing-services business, Epsilon, for $4.4 billion.\n\nThe ad business is facing a flurry of challenges as clients replace long-term agency contracts with short-term projects, cut agency fees and seek new expertise to help them resonate with ad-averse consumers who are spending more time online. Ad holding companies are also competing with consultancies that are aggressively acquiring ad services capabilities and agencies.\n\n\"We have clearly identified the challenges affecting our industry, and we haven't lost a second in addressing them,\" said Mr. Sadoun.\n\nPublicis had already cut its organic revenue growth target in July. For 2020, the company expects its organic revenue growth to come in between -2% and +1%.\n\nOlivia Bugault contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 11, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
