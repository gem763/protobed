REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\n\nDespite much higher risks of contracting the virus that causes AIDS, as well as other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), users search online \u201chook-up\u201d apps like Grindr for tags such as \u201chigh and horny\u201d or \u201cparty and play\u201d to find others wanting drug-heightened and often anonymous and unprotected sex.\n\nThe result, AIDS experts say, is that in cities across Europe, HIV is spreading rapidly among men who have sex with men - leading to concentrated epidemics in hard-to-reach groups.\n\n\u201cChemsex is very pervasive now - it\u2019s a growing phenomenon,\u201d said Rusi Jaspal, a professor of psychology and sexual health at De Montfort University in the British city of Leicester who has been studying the spread of HIV and the chemsex scene.\n\nAt a London conference hosted by the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care (IAPAC), the group\u2019s president Jose Zuniga, described chemsex as a \u201cchallenge of proportions we cannot fully comprehend at this time\u201d.\n\nChemsex is characterised by the use of drugs such as crystal meth, mephedrone and GHB, or gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, to enhance sexual arousal, performance and pleasure.\n\nA subset of chemsex is known as \u201cslamsex\u201d, where partygoers self-inject drugs rather than taking them as pills or via pipes.\n\nThe drugs \u201creduce inhibitions and increase feelings of horniness or lust\u201d, Jaspal said, and contribute to \u201ca perfect storm\u201d in groups with high HIV rates for the virus to spread.\n\nIn a small study published in 2014 of people attending HIV clinics in England and Wales, 30% of HIV-positive men surveyed reported chemsex in the previous year, and 10% said they\u2019d engaged in slamsex.\n\nHIGH-RISK BEHAVIOUR\n\nIgnacio Labayen de Inza, a chemsex specialist who works at several UK clinics and online as a counsellor for men seeking help, says \u201cthings have got much worse\u201d since then.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a UK thing,\u201d he told Reuters during the IAPAC conference. \u201cIt\u2019s in Amsterdam, Berlin, Munich, Rome, Kiev, Moscow, Helsinki - and in many of what people call \u2018gay destinations\u2019, like (Spain\u2019s) Ibiza, Torremolinos, the Canary Islands.\u201d\n\nA Spain-based study last year found that of almost 750 HIV-positive men surveyed, 60% reported having unprotected anal sex and 62% had been diagnosed with an STI. Rates of infections and high-risk sexual behaviour were higher among the 30% who reported having engaged in chemsex or slamsex.\n\nGlobally, the fight against HIV and AIDS has made dramatic progress in the past decade. According to the UNAIDS agency, 1.7 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2018, a 16% drop since 2010, driven mostly by reducing HIV rates in Africa.\n\nBut progress is stalling and the epidemic is tightening its grip in key groups. UNAIDS says more then half of new HIV cases in 2018 were in minority or marginalised groups such as men who have sex with men, transgender people and sex workers.\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS can\u2019t be cured, but can be kept in check for decades with cocktails of highly effective antiviral medicines. It\u2019s partly this advance that is behind the high-risk practice of chemsex, said de Inza.\n\n\u201cPeople are not scared any more of HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people I see say they think \u2018it\u2019s only a matter of time anyway, so I might as well have some fun\u2019.\u201d\n\nShannon Hader, deputy director of UNAIDS, says the key to limiting chemsex and its consequences is to get the right protection messages and methods to those who need them.\n\nEncouraging use of HIV prevention drugs known as PreP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is one effective step, she said, and can give people who have chemsex some control over their health.\n\n\u201cIn this epidemic, we always have to be looking for what\u2019s coming next that we\u2019re not addressing,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cAnd with PreP, we need to ensure we\u2019re not missing people in the chemsex environment.\u201d", "description": "A surge in \"chemsex\" parties, where people spend days getting high on drugs and having sex with scores of partners, is re-fuelling epidemics of HIV among gay men in European towns and cities, doctors say.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429058287&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0Z0", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
