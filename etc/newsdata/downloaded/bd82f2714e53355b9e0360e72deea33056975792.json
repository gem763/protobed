It showed a picture of 19 envelopes signed by her late husband during his final weeks of battling terminal liver cancer in 2006.\n\nDespite battling with the disease during his final months, the devoted dad wrote down future blessings for his daughter.\n\nFrom his crooked writing it\u2019s clear that he struggled to pen the birthday cards to his daughter, who was just over a year old when he passed. She was set to be receiving the cards from her second birthday.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was born in January 2005, and her father died of liver cancer in May 2006 when she was just one year and four months old,\u201d Ms Chu captioned the touching tribute post.\n\n\u201cFrom 2007 for her second birthday, until 2025 when she turns 20. But she was still too young, so I kept them for her. I wanted to give them to her when she was older,\u201d the mother explained.\n\nIn the post, which has been liked over 11 000 times, Ms Chu revealed that she\u2019d be handing the letters over to her daughter who\u2019s now in secondary school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never opened them and never wanted to, because your late father left these letters for you, to send you messages that transcend time and space.\u201d\n\nSources: Magazine Features\n\n", "description": "A woman\u2019s post in which she shared 19 birthday cards from her late husband dedicated to their daughter, went viral on Facebook.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9491/2dc5398931474a99ba4fc11aacf3797a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
