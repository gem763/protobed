The president also scoffed at the \u201csecondhand\u201d information in the complaint, which was made public on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn\u2019t a Whistleblower at all,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?\u201d\n\nAlthough the whistleblower\u2019s identity is unknown to the public, a New York Times report identified the person as a male CIA employee who\u2019d been detailed to the White House for a time.\n\nThe report says the official has a sophisticated understanding of U.S. relations with Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats, who are pursuing impeachment over the episode, say the whistleblower must be protected, especially after Mr. Trump made references to \u201cspies\u201d and \u201ctreason\u201d in an address to the U.N. delegation in New York on Thursday.\n\nThey also dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s theories.\n\n\u201cHaving a bad day? (Week?),\u201d Rep. Mark Pocan, Wisconsin Democrat, tweeted back at the president.\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower admits that the information is largely secondhand, though cites multiple officials as verifying accounts.\n\nThe complaint also accurately summarized a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A memorandum on the call, essentially a rough transcript, was released to the public earlier this week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
