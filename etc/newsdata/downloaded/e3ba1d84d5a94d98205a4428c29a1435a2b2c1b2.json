Saturday: Protesters will meet the Imperial War Museum and then march through London 'in an expression of profound grief for all we have lost.' Sunday: The activists will take time to reflect and there will be a 'grief ceremony' on Lambeth Bridge.

Tuesday: Activists will come together to block Vauxhall Bridge and enjoy a feast to 'celebrate life' and 'discuss food security.' Wednesday: A further day of action to highlight food insecurity. A number of protesters are due to storm road blocks, disrupting traffic. The group will also be targeting new media outlets for spreading 'systematic disinformation on climate change' Thursday: Protesters will head to Liverpool Street in east London to disrupt an event 'to promote oil & gas globally.' Friday: The two weeks of action ends with the people's speech at noon on Trafalgar Square. It will be 'based on the demands of the rebels on the streets.' And then there will be some accompanying disruption.

The people losing profits will hate us. The media will demonise us. The people in the street may resist us.\n\n\u2018We might be called terrorists. We might cause people to go hungry. Parents will be late picking up their kids. We\u2019ll cause people to struggle to pay rent. We\u2019ll cause people working on wonderful, progressive, healing art projects to have their cause set back and their art seen by no one.\n\n\u2018At the same time we need to hold the awareness that these things are occurring within an insane and suicidal system.\u2019\n\nThe activists plan to shut down 11 roads around Whitehall. Some of the roadblocks will consist of about 20 cyclists who will hand out cupcakes and attempt to placate irate motorists.\n\nThe group compares the tactic to Genghis Khan\u2019s \u2018Mongolian light cavalry\u2019.\n\nTheir document advises calming drivers with remarks such as: \u201cYou\u2019re really angry, I can see that \u2013 and you really want to be on your way, yeah?\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion plans to hand out \u2018bust cards\u2019 informing protesters of their legal rights. It says that small-scale deployments are harder for police to \u2018kettle\u2019 \u2013 or contain.\n\nIt also advises a tactic of 50 people walking backwards and forwards across a crossing continuously for seven minutes to create \u2018cascading congestion\u2019, adding: \u2018This is totally legal.\u2019\n\nAn XR press release said they will follow the Queen's Speech with 'A People's Speech' in Trafalgar Square on October 18.\n\n'In the face of Ecological and Climate breakdown, the Government needs to start taking action as soon as the new session of Parliament starts', it said.\n\n'The Queen's Speech, on 14th October, will set out the agenda for the coming parliamentary session. We will gather at Trafalgar Square and deliver The People's Speech, based on the demands of the rebels on the streets.\n\n'This will be accompanied by disruptive, creative actions.'\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesman Joel Scott-Halkes said: 'We are going to the Government and specifically what we're going to do is sit down peacefully in the roads.\n\n'We're going to blockade and shut down every single road going into the central area of Westminster around the UK Government.\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony protesters set up a tent city underneath trees in Hyde Park a few hundred yards from Marble Arch\n\nActivists holding a banner of a very colourful human shaped drawing made up of different types of animal such as a lion or panda\n\n'We are going to very loudly, very clearly, very respectfully say that if a government is taking its people towards extinction, it is not a government anymore that we respect.'\n\nIt comes after model Daisy Lowe and Spice Girl Mel B unveiled themselves as the latest celebrities to back Extinction Rebellion.\n\nDaisy, a 30-year-old Vogue cover girl, posed with an 'XR' badge alongside her friend Mel B.\n\nDaisy, who was born in Westminster, said she backed the plans to disrupt Parliament by thousands of protesters who plan to block all routes into the area surrounding the House of Commons.\n\nSpice Girl Mel B, 44, added: 'I was born a fighter, I stood proud as a mixed race woman and championed girl power.\n\n'I fight for victims of abuse and I'm giving all my support to these brave activists to make a better world for us all.'\n\n'I am so grateful that Extinction Rebellion exists,' Daisy said.\n\n'It's time for change. It's time for rebellion and I love being able to be part of it.'\n\nShe joins The Crown's Oscar-winning actor Olivia Colman, broadcaster, author Stephen Fry, and TV comic Alan Carr in backing the activists.\n\nThe actors donned 'X' badges at the Royal Albert Hall and were joined by comedian Asim Chaudry, and American actress Crystal Clarke.\n\nThe Cardiff branch of Extinction Rebellion heading to London for the two weeks of protests in the capital\n\nActivists in central London this evening for the opening ceremony.

It doesn't demand the piecemeal action we're currently seeing across the world.\n\n'It needs radical change to our system because currently what we're looking at is accelerating destruction, ecosystems across the world being wiped out at rates that are rapidly increasing.\n\n'It highlights we are in a system that is criminally failing us, a system, economically, that cannot handle what is happening, it needs change in a dramatic way.'\n\nPolice arrested ten Extinction Rebellion activists in London ahead of the planned new round of protests on Monday, the force revealed.\n\nOfficers used a battering ram to break down a door and enter a former court building that was used by campaigners to store equipment, a witness said yesterday.\n\nA spokesman for London's Metropolitan Police said seven women and three men had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance.\n\nOfficers used a battering ram to break down a door and enter a former court building that was used by campaigners to store equipment, a witness said.
