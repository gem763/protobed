They wanted to destroy my credibility. So my credibility would be tarnished in front of another employer.'\n\nSoon, a mysterious man with 'no official job title' was reportedly employed to intimidate women around the office, and Sylvia compared him to a member of 'the Mafia'.\n\nShe went on: 'Then new management came in things started changing, they came into our office like the Mafia. They brought a gentleman in who had no official job title and he would just walk around the office.'\n\nCheryl told a similar story of how things quickly began to change when she became increasingly suspicious of the peculiar paperwork coming through the office.\n\nShe recalled how a man once sat beside her at her desk with his leg close to hers, breathing heavily and making suggestive remarks.\n\n'He was talking about African American women and what he'd heard they were like and whether was I like that and just being very sexual,' Cheryl said.\n\nLehman Brothers' collapse triggered a worldwide financial crisis; it had more than $600billion in assets and was the largest bankruptcy filing in the history of the US\n\nWhen she left BNC, Cheryl said she called her supervisor at her new job and they said they had 'changed their mind, they weren't gonna hire me'.\n\nThe mother told how she was subsequently blacklisted from all other mortgage firms and eventually lost her home and her car, despite only having four months left to pay on it, as she was unable to maintain her payments.\n\n'I eventually lost my place,' she said. 'I got evicted because I couldn't pay the rent, I lost my car... I couldn't send my son to school, to this day he'll say it doesn't bother him but I know it did because he kind of blames me for not pursuing his career.'\n\nSylvia claimed on the day she left BNC, the man mysteriously hired to 'intimidate' the women threatened her and her daughter's lives, warning her he 'knew where she lived'.\n\n'On the day I was leaving the office I got to the person who would harass me and threaten my life,' she recalled.\n\n'He pulled me in and whispered in my ears, \"I know everything about you, I know where your daughters go to school, I know where they live, I own you\".'\n\nThe mother said she then arrived home to find somebody had been inside her house, and told of the 'devastating' effect it had on her and her family.\n\nShe said: 'Things were torn and moved and things were gone and people were letting me know, \"Hey we've been at your house, it's a devastating way to live,\" and my children said, \"We don't like this new you\".'\n\nStoryville's Inside Lehman Brothers: The Whistleblowers will air on Monday on BBC Four at 10pm.", "description": "Sylvia Vega-Sutfin,\u00a0of Nevada City, and\u00a0Cheryl McNeil worked for BNC Mortage, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers acquired by them in 1997, before the investment bank went bust in 2008.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20086828-0-image-a-30_1571840957647.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
