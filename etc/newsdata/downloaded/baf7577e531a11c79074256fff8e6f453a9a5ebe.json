Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has tied his candidacy recently to a mandatory AR-15 and AK-47 weapon buyback proposal to limit the number of firearms on the streets. At the last debate, when he was asked whether that meant he was proposing to take away guns, O\u2019Rourke responded, \u201cHell yes.\u201d\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, O\u2019Rourke took issue with Buttigieg\u2019s description of the plan as a \u201cshiny object\u201d that will distract from efforts to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nO\u2019Rourke called the comment \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to \u201cevery survivor of mass casualty assault.\u201d\n\nButtigieg responded, \u201cCongressman, you just made it clear that you don\u2019t know how this is going to take weapons off the street. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it, but we can\u2019t wait. People are dying in the streets right now but we can\u2019t wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to get through.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke shot back: \u201cThis is a crisis and we have to do something about it.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the actions of the Parkland students in demanding urgent action on the issue.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s follow their inspiration and lead, and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nButtigieg, however, took that as a dig on his own proposals.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t in the polls. It is in the policy. I don\u2019t need lessons from you in courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg said, adding that the problem is the National Rifle Association \u201cand their enablers in Congress and we should be united in taking the fight to them.\u201d\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
