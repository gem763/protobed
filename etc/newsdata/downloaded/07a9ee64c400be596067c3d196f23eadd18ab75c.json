Photo: CBC Television\n\nIn the inaugural season of Workin\u2019 Moms, Jenny (Jessalyn Wanlim) is downright determined to get her nipple pierced in a gritty bar bathroom. It doesn\u2019t matter that she just had a baby, that she\u2019s breastfeeding, or that she\u2019s drunk enough to make her friends do the piercing with an earring. She\u2019s struggling to adjust to motherhood, and so, understandably, she\u2019s rebelling.\n\nThe scene sums up the ethos of Workin\u2019 Moms, a Canadian ensemble comedy that navigates the identity crises, careers, and meltdowns of moms dealing with the messiness of postpartum life. In the Workin\u2019 Moms universe, those moments are simultaneously dark, cringeworthy, and hilarious. They\u2019re what make the show so addictive.\n\nFor creator and star Catherine Reitman, Jenny\u2019s \u201cmessy, selfish, self-destructive spiral\u201d story line is very real. \u201cA lot of moms all of a sudden get a tattoo, a dramatic haircut, get into ska music, or make these weird choices because they\u2019re trying to make sure they still have an identity outside of being a mother,\u201d she says. With two kids of her own, she knows what it\u2019s like firsthand: Reitman has dealt with postpartum depression, an identity crisis, permanent body changes, and the challenges of breastfeeding. \u201cI identify with Jenny. Jenny represents this part of all of us that we don\u2019t want to talk about \u2014 our vanity, our selfishness, our ego. Especially coming in as an actress who got pregnant, I remember feeling so severely that I was going to have this kid and no one was going to think I was pretty or interesting or sexy anymore,\u201d she says.\n\nThe CBC series, which arrived on Netflix last February, features a cast that delivers story arcs toeing the line between the sincerity of Schitt\u2019s Creek and the vulgarity of Superbad. There\u2019s Reitman\u2019s character, Kate, an ambitious PR exec who must constantly choose between her son and her career; Jenny, who after giving birth realizes she\u2019s not ready to be a mother and would rather be partying; Dani Kind\u2019s angry and blunt mother of two, Anne; and the endearing and eccentric Frankie, played by Juno Rinaldi.\n\nThe idea for Workin\u2019 Moms was born when Reitman got pregnant and felt \u201chungry\u201d to see herself represented on TV, but all the women she saw onscreen either looked \u201cperfect\u201d or \u201cwere at home struggling.\u201d In her eyes, the popular depictions of motherhood were too broad. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe there wasn\u2019t a story like this when it\u2019s clearly more than half the population out there going through it every day,\u201d she says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a more relatable and sort of fantasy-fulfillment show that covered the subject matter.\u201d\n\nSo Reitman created her own vision of motherhood on the small screen, the messy, cringeworthy world that she and other moms she knew had actually experienced. Her goal? To show that being a new mom was a lot more nuanced than pop culture often cared to admit. \u201cI remember being really hungry to watch what I thought would be what I looked like as a working mother on TV and in films, and I had a really hard time identifying with the representation there was,\u201d she says. Because of that, Reitman weaved in narratives that other shows typically glaze over, like a true-to-life look at the art and annoyance of breast pumping (and dumping), intimacy issues post-birth, and women\u2019s porn preferences. The series doesn\u2019t hold back on the moms-gone-wild moments, either, like when the ladies wind up tripping on psychedelics during an overnight trip, and heavier plotlines about postpartum depression, abortion, and the difficult choices between work and family figure into the story, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would be doing mothers much justice [if] I tried to tell these stories without showing the teeth that are involved in being a working mother because it does get dark,\u201d she says.\n\nReitman\u2019s shining moment is perhaps the show\u2019s most cringeworthy story line: At the end of season two, Kate finds out she\u2019s pregnant the same night she discovers her husband Nathan (played by Reitman\u2019s actual husband Philip Sternberg) is having an affair with the nanny. That turning point has a domino effect on the next season, as Kate ends up dating her old boss\u2019s 22-year-old son after he starts working for her. Turns out, the guy has a breast-milk fetish and ends up suing her for sexual harassment, even though their relationship was consensual. It\u2019s a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Reitman says she\u2019s attracted to \u201cmessy\u201d storytelling. \u201cUsually when there\u2019s mess involved, that means you\u2019re into something good and real and meaty, otherwise it feels like the story lines feel too convenient or light,\u201d she explains. That messiness, she believes, has been positive for the show, with fans applauding its emotionally complex plotlines. (She also credits Schitt\u2019s Creek, which premiered on CBC two years before Workin\u2019 Moms, for paving the way for both comedy and drama and building an international audience on Netflix.)\n\nBut alongside that praise, Reitman\u2019s series has also drawn its critics. The mothers on Workin\u2019 Moms all have nannies and stay-at-home partners, definitely a luxury that many parents can\u2019t afford, and as Slate\u2019s Sarah Jaffe noted in March, the show inaccurately depicts postpartum depression by conflating it with postpartum psychosis. Then there\u2019s also the representation factor: The moms are mainly white, aside from Jenny, and there\u2019s not much depth given to Frankie\u2019s wife, Gisele (Olunik\u00e9 Adeliyi), the only other person of color on the show. In response to that criticism, Reitman says she just wrote what she knew. \u201cIt was very personal to me to tell the stories that I knew from a perspective that I felt really confident in, and so that\u2019s what I did,\u201d she explains. \u201cAt the time when I was diagnosed, it was called postpartum depression. Frankie\u2019s story is pretty tied into my exact experiences with postpartum depression. The last thing I want to do is deal with it too lightly or in a way that doesn\u2019t honor people\u2019s experience. It\u2019s an accurate representation of what I went through, but that doesn\u2019t mean that every person deals with it this way.\u201d\n\nBut as the daughter of actress Genevi\u00e8ve Robert and film director Ivan Reitman, she\u2019s also quick to acknowledge how her privilege influenced that perspective. \u201cI\u2019m really lucky. I was born into a very fortunate situation where I had financial stability, and I\u2019ve continued to work hard to keep that,\u201d she says. And while she recognizes that a lot of real mothers struggle far more than the women of Workin\u2019 Moms, she points out that her characters aren\u2019t uniformly comfortable in life: \u201cA lot of people say it\u2019s four rich white chicks and it\u2019s not. I mean, Kate and Anna are absolutely doing well and they can afford help and they\u2019re got great places to live. Frankie, of course, is much more middle class and she has day-care situation. Jenny has her [stay-at-home husband] and lives in an apartment.\u201d\n\nWhile season three hit Netflix in August, season four of Workin\u2019 Moms is set to air on CBC in early 2020. Moving forward, Reitman aims to diversify the storytelling with new characters who bring different perspectives to the show, all the while keeping the unpolished characters and messy plot points alive and well. \u201cI want to represent every walk of life, and if I fail to do that in any way, it\u2019s something I take really personally,\u201d she says. \u201cAll we can do is get better.\u201d", "description": "The CBC comedy Workin\u2019 Moms doesn\u2019t flinch at the absurd realities of postpartum life.
