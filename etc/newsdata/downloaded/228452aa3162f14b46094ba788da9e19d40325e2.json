But Anna Pasternak revealed in the Sunday Times that she had sent a legal letter to Prescott, claiming that the novel features \u201can astonishing number of substantial elements\u201d copied from Pasternak\u2019s 2016 biography Lara, which is about Olga Ivinskaya, Pasternak\u2019s lover, muse and inspiration for his character Lara.\n\nThe letter sees Anna Pasternak claim that similarities \u201cexceed the mere inspiration a novelist may legitimately draw from a work of non-fiction\u201d. She is seeking damages or compensation for the alleged infringement of copyright.\n\nAn event with both authors at the forthcoming Cheltenham Literature festival \u2013 sponsored by the Sunday Times \u2013 has now been cancelled due to \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday, Penguin Random House said that it and Prescott considered Anna Pasternak\u2019s claim to be unfounded.\n\n\u201cIf proceedings are in fact issued, they will be robustly defended,\u201d said the publisher. \u201cAnna Pasternak\u2019s claims are simply without any merit, and it is disappointing that she has chosen to litigate in the press rather than wait for the response to her letter of complaint within the timeline requested by her own lawyers.\u201d\n\nPenguin Random House pointed out that the story of Olga Ivinskaya has been the subject of multiple books before Anna Pasternak\u2019s, including Ivinskaya\u2019s 1978 autobiography, a book by her daughter Irina Emelyanova, and Peter Finn and Petra Couvee\u2019s 2014 book The Zhivago Affair.\n\n\u201cThe subject matter of both books is one of historical record and has been covered by other books in the past,\u201d said the publisher.\n\nWhen it was published in 2016, Lara was billed as: \u201cThe untold love story that inspired Doctor Zhivago\u201d. A New York Times review said that \u201cthe \u2018untold\u2019 in the subtitle simply isn\u2019t true\u201d because \u201cthe story of Pasternak\u2019s affair with Olga has been told repeatedly\u201d. It concluded: \u201cPasternak fans and incurable romantics will be better off sticking to Doctor Zhivago, or searching out the earlier memoirs that serve as this new book\u2019s central sources.\u201d", "description": "Boris Pasternak\u2019s great-niece Anna claims Lara Prescott\u2019s The Secrets We Kept copied her biography of Pasternak\u2019s lover", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e4ec9ccdf5b88753ec87eb9d144c0860c2f78f3/0_29_950_570/master/950.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37c0c46b33c10cccc6f4379b2e159a9c", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
