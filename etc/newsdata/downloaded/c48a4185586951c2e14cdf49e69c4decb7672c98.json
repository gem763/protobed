And, if that isn't enough, there\u2019s always that raw and very unexpected Instagram video Shawn shared featuring a ton of tongue to really drill it in.\n\nLook, maybe Shamila fans are right and this romance really has been brewing since 2015, when the couple released their first song, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and now they\u2019re finally letting fans in on what they did this summer.\n\nOr...maybe not.\n\nInstead of spending another one of the final few summer days speculating whether Shamila is or isn\u2019t an industry prop, WH brought in an expert. Jane Greer, PhD, a relationship and family therapist in New York and author of What About Me? Stop Selfishness From Ruining Your Relationship, stepped in to analyze the couple\u2019s body language and confirm once and for all, whether Shawn and Camila are actually, really, truly in a genuine relationship.
