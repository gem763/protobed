Nor is he looking to make anyone his bitch. These days he's more like your friendly gaming grandpa\u2014as we spoke, he placed his words carefully and deliberately, as if he were positioning game pieces on a hex grid. He became animated as we discussed game mechanics but otherwise answered questions almost laconically, with a slight smile\u2014after all, he's been dealing with the press for decades.\n\nMeier spent a few hours walking us through the birth of Civilization, one of the most famous and lauded franchises in the history of gaming. It's among those rarest of titles that effectively mainstreamed an entire genre\u2014in this case, the \"4X game\" (which stands for \"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate\"). Although Civilization wasn't the first strategy game on the market, it was the proverbial 800-pound gorilla\u2014and it did for turn-based strategy games what Doom would do for the FPS genre a few years later.\n\nBut as so often happens with genre-defining games, Civilization started out as a very different experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo wine before its time\n\nMeier explained how the design process for Civilization followed the release of Railroad Tycoon in 1990. The idea of simulating railroad ownership had indeed translated into a fun game, and Meier wanted to expand on the concept and give players the chance to manage an entire simulated world. Armed with some solid reference material that laid out the guideposts of how developing civilizations became civilizations, Meier and his team knocked together some early Civ prototypes.\n\nBut the concept didn't quite gel. Those early prototypes were stuck in real-time, with the player directing units and tech development without the structure and pacing imposed by turns. The team took some time away from Civ to complete another stalled project, a real-time Tom Clancy-esque spy game called Covert Action. Switching focus to Covert Action ended up providing the perspective that Meier needed\u2014and when he eventually set his sights back on Civ, he decided to shake things up a bit and change the game's flow by making it fully turn-based.\n\nJust one more turn...\n\nAs with so many other sea changes, the magnitude of the switch wasn't really obvious at the time. But Meier and the rest of the developers realized they had accidentally bottled lightning when early testers kept reporting that they were losing track of time while playing\u2014they got the \"I looked up and it was 3am\" story from so many testers that the development team put a concerted effort into trying to figure out exactly what they'd managed to create.\n\nThe crux of the \"just one more turn\" phenomena, according to Meier, came down to how the game allowed players to structure their own expectations. Whether it's in real-time or chopped up in turns, a game like Civ gives players short-, medium-, and long-term goals to head toward, and there's rarely a moment where you've achieved all of those goals at once. But by quantizing gameplay into distinct turns, Civ provides the illusion that the player isn't that far away from nailing down all the loose ends standing between them and victory. Turns become distinct steps on the road to victory\u2014and once you're into the mid-game of Civ, that victory doesn't seem that many turns away.\n\n\"You're almost not playing in the moment,\" Meier told us. \"You're playing in the future\u2014and that future is just one more turn ahead.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue with the results\u2014Civilization still dominates the 4X genre to this day.\n\n(Make sure to stick around until the end of the video\u2014Meier was able to rustle up one of the original Civ dev boxes and demo a prerelease version of the game for us!)", "description": "This \"War Stories\" video explores how Civilization almost wasn't a turn-based game.", "authors": ["Lee Hutchinson"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/arstechnica_war-stories-civilization-1-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
