And conservative co-host Meghan McCain was the loudest in her condemnation of the administration.\n\nWith the panel discussing the rising casualties of Kurdish forces and civilians following the Turkish invasion, McCain brought up reports that American military officers in the area are ashamed of their country right now for abandoning their allies.\n\nSaying she was happy \u201cthere\u2019s outrage on both sides\u201d over this issue, McCain went on to note that Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)\u2014one of the few supporters in Congress of Trump\u2019s decision\u2014will be on The View on Friday but she will be off for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to ask him,\u201d she addressed her colleagues. \u201cThere is blood on anyone\u2019s hands, starting with him and President Trump\u2019s, letting this happen because there are people being slaughtered after standing with our troops in the Middle East for an extremely long time fighting against terror cells!\u201d\n\nMcCain continued: \u201cAnd we are not entering into a foreign war. These are proxies supporting us. The whole point of having proxies is so we don\u2019t get into another war! And I\u2019m sorry, have we not learned the lessons of 9/11?! I don\u2019t understand it. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m upset, but this has been going on for weeks. These people are being killed and slaughtered!\u201d\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin eventually jumped in, asserting that the president\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurds could be a factor in why there is a recent increase in Republican voters favoring impeachment against him, pointing to the latest polls that show a strong majority of Americans support at least an impeachment inquiry.\n\nMcCain, however, said she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to talk about impeachment\u201d while shaking her head as Hostin spoke. This caused the table to go back and forth for a moment as McCain wanted to \u201chave a conversation\u201d about Turkey, prompting host Whoopi Goldberg to step in and tell the former Fox News personality that she needed to let liberal co-host Joy Behar get a word in first.\n\nBehar, meanwhile, took issue with Republicans standing up to Trump now on the Kurds when they were fine with his border policies that resulted in children being locked up and taken away from their parents.\n\n\u201cThat is who he is, and what makes you think he cares about innocent Kurds being slaughtered when he doesn\u2019t care about innocent children being taken away from their parents?\u201d Behar exclaimed. \u201cThis is the same man. So don\u2019t tell me that the Republican Party is now standing up to him. They should have done it before, and we wouldn\u2019t be in this position.\u201d\n\nMcCain would go on to accuse Behar of \u201cblame-shifting,\u201d saying the situation at the border is bad but this situation in Syria is \u201copening up a Pandora\u2019s Box\u201d that our \u201cgeneration\u2019s children will be dealing with\u201d from now on.\n\nAfter Behar said she was just saying there was blame for both and that this should have been foreseen, McCain sighed in frustration and eventually replied: \u201cI think everything is bad. I did not support what happened on the border, as you\u2019re aware. I don\u2019t care about impeachment right now. I think what is happening is so much gravely worse.\u201d\n\nHostin, meanwhile, responded that she should care about impeachment \u201cbecause if he can do this, he can do a lot worse.\u201d", "description": "She also suggested Rand Paul has \u201cblood on his hands.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570723798/view_75_prv4dg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
