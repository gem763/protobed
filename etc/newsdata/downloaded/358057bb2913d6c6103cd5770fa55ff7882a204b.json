Misconstruing these photos means playing the Maduro regime\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nWILFREDO CA\u00d1IZARES (@wilcan91) Lo dijimos desde el primer d\u00eda: la entrada a Colombia el 23 de febrero del sr @jguaido fue coordinada con los Rastrojos. Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n alias el brother armado, y el segundo al mando de este grupo paramilitar, alias el menor. pic.twitter.com/qflAYBgWQf\n\nBut analysts said the images had the potential to cause severe harm to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s credibility and his nine-month quest to force Maduro from power.\n\nThe Rastrojos are a drug-trafficking group with paramilitary origins who operate on both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border. As well as the cocaine trade, they are engaged in illegal mining, kidnapping for ransom and extortion.\n\nPhil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group, said: \u201cI think it is extremely damaging. Regardless of whether this was as innocent as they claim \u2013 which is rather hard to believe \u2013 or whether there was something more to it, it looks so bad.\u201d\n\nGunson said the photos handed \u201ca huge propaganda victory\u201d to Maduro\u2019s government, which is fending off accusations of ties to leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.\n\nMaduro sought to exploit the scandal on Thursday, claiming the images were definitive evidence of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ties to \u201cparacos, murderers and narco-traffickers\u201d.\n\nIn a televised speech, Maduro declared: \u201cThe connection between Colombian narco-trafficking and the Venezuelan right is right there in the photo. No one can deny it.\u201d\n\nAnother senior Chavista, Freddy Bernal, claimed the photos were proof of \u201cthe criminal alliance between [Venezuela\u2019s] fascist right\u201d and paramilitary and terrorist groups. Maduro\u2019s main propaganda channels also gave the scandal top billing.\n\nCarlos Vecchio, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador to the United States, rejected those claims. \u201cThere is no connection between Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s interim government [and] any paramilitary or guerrilla group. Zero, zero,\u201d he told the Colombian newspaper El Espectador.\n\nGunson said that whatever the truth, the photos showed \u201cunbelievable naivety\u201d and were an embarrassment to the international coalition backing Guaid\u00f3, which includes the US, Colombia, Brazil and the UK.\n\n\u201cIt could almost not have come at a worse time for Guaid\u00f3,\u201d Gunson said, pointing to the Colombian government\u2019s plans to denounce Maduro\u2019s ties to leftist guerrillas at the UN general assembly later this month.\n\nGunson said Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim not to have realised who he was posing with was \u201cfrankly not credible \u2026 [One of them] looks like a paramilitary out of central casting.\u201d\n\nThe photos were published on Thursday by Wilfredo Ca\u00f1izales, the director of a human rights group in C\u00facuta, where February\u2019s highly politicised concert was held.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Ca\u00f1izales claimed the Rastrojos had imposed a curfew along the border before Guaid\u00f3\u2019s crossing into Colombia \u201cto make sure no locals would take photos of him crossing illegally through the hidden paths\u201d.\n\nCa\u00f1izales declined to say how he had obtained the photos or why he had decided to publish them but said: \u201cThe Rastrojos are paramilitaries. They are the ones in this region who decide who lives and who dies.\u201d\n\nGunson said the photos also posed uncomfortable questions for Guaid\u00f3\u2019s backers in the Colombian government and their possible links with paramilitary groups. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions that haven\u2019t been answered,\u201d he said.", "description": "Opposition leader plays down images but analysts say they could prove highly damaging", "authors": ["Tom Phillips", "Joe Parkin Daniels"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c61f4e99a4b242b05d2a2188e23fa2eea04848/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa7e8f60fc685765ba3cdbf2a107d38d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
