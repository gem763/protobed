And given that he has shown himself to be a manifest liar and somebody who has said he would \u2018die in a ditch\u2019 rather than stop no deal \u2026 our first priority has to be that we must stop no deal and we must make sure that that is going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe government has suggested it will hold a vote on another motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act on Monday, a procedure that requires two-thirds of MPs to back it if it is to pass.\n\nThornberry\u2019s comments appear to confirm that Labour will reject for a second time any attempt to call an election on 15 October, despite Conservative taunts that it is fearful of the outcome.\n\nShe said Johnson was \u201cas slippery as can be\u201d and could not be trusted over the timing of polling day.\n\nShe suggested Labour would back an election in November after an extension to Brexit had been agreed. She said: \u201cWe are not talking about very long, are we, but we need to get this immediate crisis dealt with first.\u201d\n\nShe also appeared to rule out Labour calling for a no-confidence motion in the government next week. \u201cLooking at the rules it would be difficult for us to have a successful motion of no confidence,\u201d she said.\n\nThornberry insisted Labour was \u201cunited\u201d with opposition parties on the need to rule out a no-deal Brexit before backing an election. She said: \u201cThe possibility of having a general election obviously is extremely attractive, but we have an immediate crisis in front of us and that has to be sorted before we do anything else.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, given the behaviour of the prime minister and his advisers, we need to be absolutely sure that we are not going to end up in a situation where the general election is used as a distraction while they, by some cunning wheeze, bounce us out of the European Union without a deal.\u201d\n\nHer comments echo remarks she made on BBC\u2019s Question Time on Thursday night, when she said: \u201cWe want a general election. Of course we do, [but] at the moment the emergency is we have a dishonest prime minister who will use every means possible to get us out of the European Union without a deal.\u201d\n\nThornberry also confirmed Labour was set to a back a second referendum in its manifesto. She said: \u201cIf we won the general election we would need to put a viable way of leaving the EU that had been negotiated with jobs and the economy at the forefront of our minds versus remain. Whatever deal was finally agreed by whatever government, we would demand a referendum.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cOn the basis of what Jeremy [Corbyn] has said we would need to put a viable leave option against remain. There would be a referendum and it would be for the good sense of the British people to decide which way we went forward. This is proper democracy. We have been struggling with this for three years but in the end we are deferential to the will of the people and it has been a long time since the last referendum.\u201d", "description": "Shadow foreign secretary says no-deal Brexit must be ruled out before party can back poll", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b2c8dedede509ea769f656151e2b0a166dfb44/0_238_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c13ece43074df73711c75af510de61f", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
