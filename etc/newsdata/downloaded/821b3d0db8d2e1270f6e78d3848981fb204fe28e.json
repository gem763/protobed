Our expenses continue to be restrained, with sequential slight reductions in research and development and general and administrative expenses, the latter due to our having concluded the current trial phase of our IP litigation in India, offset by a slight increase in sales and marketing.\"\n\nThe decline in polishing activity due to the reduced quantities of rough stones entering the pipeline also resulted in a decrease in the group's revenues from inclusion-mapping services by some 18 per cent sequentially, less than the decrease in the rough quantities being polished, it said.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"Most of this decrease was realised in our service centre activities, just over half of which are in Israel and Belgium, which are also affected by the seasonal summer closures of these bourses in August,\" it added.\n\nOver the quarter, Sarine Tech said it delivered a new record of 39 inclusion-mapping systems from its Galaxy brand family, outpacing deliveries in the first and second quarters this year.\n\nThe group's full financial report is expected to be released on Nov 10.\n\nSarine Tech shares fell half a Singapore cent or 2.04 per cent to close at S$0.24 on Thursday.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - MAINBOARD-LISTED\u00a0Sarine\u00a0Technologies, which makes precision technology products used in diamond and gemstone production, said it expects to post a \"nominal net profit\" in the third quarter. .
