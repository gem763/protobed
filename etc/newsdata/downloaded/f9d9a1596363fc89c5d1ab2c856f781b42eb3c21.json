I don\u2019t believe a word of what it says because in 2018, the network killed my #MeToo story that was being reported by MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid. Incredibly, a year after NBC botched Farrow\u2019s reporting on Harvey Weinstein, they had the audacity to do it again.\n\nIn November 2017, I told Joy about my experience of being raped by Russell Simmons in 1994. I also shared that in 2006, former Extra co-host A.J. Calloway sexually assaulted me in his car and was subsequently arrested for his crime. When Joy and I first spoke, Russell had already been accused of rape by Keri Claussen Khalighi. In fact, she appeared as a guest on the now-defunct NBC show, Megyn Kelly Today. However, I would be the first woman to allege they had been sexually assaulted by Calloway. When NBC chose to squash my story, it not only abdicated its obligation to report news, it provided cover for a man who would later be accused of serial rape and sexual assault when my story was eventually published by The Hollywood Reporter the following summer.\n\nWhen I approached Joy, I had no idea that NBC had a reputation for not breaking news about men accused of sexual assault. Therefore, I had no reason to believe my story would be derailed by the network. After going through a thorough vetting process, an on-camera interview with Joy was taped on Jan. 7, 2018. While she\u2019s a host on MSNBC, I was told that NBC was not taping it for the cable network but NBC itself, in order to get it a larger audience beyond Joy\u2019s weekend show; also, it was to be paired with a lengthy print piece written by Joy for New York magazine. I was told the TV portion was scheduled to air on Jan. 13, 2018, but I received an email the day before from Joy asking me to reach out to her.\n\nWhen we spoke a few hours later, she informed me that Russell Simmons\u2019 attorney had gone ballistic and NBC was not going to air the segment, and the New York magazine story was also on hold since they were paired. She assured me the story wasn\u2019t dead, but that NBC simply needed more vetting done in order to feel comfortable with moving forward.\n\nI was disappointed, but still hopeful. As I would come to learn, my optimism was profoundly naive.\n\nOver the next several months, NBC put me through an elaborate and bizarre vetting process. I provided legal documentation, hospital bills, and over a dozen corroborating witnesses. Still, they stonewalled. I asked Joy repeatedly if NBC was going to do to her what it did to Ronan, and she said that she didn\u2019t think so. We both agreed that it would reflect very poorly if word got out that the network had suppressed yet another story of alleged sexual assault.\n\nTo expedite the increasingly expansive vetting process, Joy\u2019s piece was assigned to an investigative unit that was supposed to help her clear the hurdles that NBC kept throwing in front of her about my story. In mid-February, she emailed me an explanation about why it was taking NBC so long to pull the trigger:\n\n\u201cSo basically the story got caught up in a couple of vices: the struggle to get comments from the principles (now mostly alleviated), threats from Russell\u2019s lawyer that spooked NBC,\u201d Joy told me via email. \u201cSo now NBC\u2026 is demanding that I do all of this additional reporting to meet a legal and standards review.\u201d\n\nJoy then said all that was left was for her to seek comment from people in Simmons\u2019 camp who were aware of the assault, and corroboration of Calloway\u2019s arrest.\n\nI responded to her email by thanking her for the update. I added, \u201cStill not clear why NBC is demanding more corroboration regarding A.J. [arrest]... his lawyer already confirmed the case, but I know this isn\u2019t about you.\u201d\n\nAlmost two weeks went by before Joy contacted me with an update.\n\n\u201cMy team and I, my PA and senior producer helping me with the story met with the standards department rep today just to figure out what the heck\u2019s going on,\u201d she told me by phone. \u201cI just have to get my company to have the guts to do the story,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI\u2019ve never done a story that has this much evidence before. I have more evidence than the LA Times and The New York Times stories combined. So the whole thing is, if my company will trust the evidence that I\u2019ve shown them, which is substantial, they will do the story.\u201d (Reid declined to comment on this story.)\n\nI then asked her if NBC was going to kill my story based upon the ongoing threats from Simmons\u2019 and Calloway\u2019s attorneys. \u201cWe have enough that we have satisfied the standards side, but this is now in the hands of lawyers who have to determine the likelihood of a lawsuit by two people now, and what is the likelihood that we will prevail.\u201d She added, \u201cThis has now gone up past the attorneys I deal with to the head of NBCUniversal\u2019s lawyers. I\u2019ve never been through anything like this.\u201d\n\n\u201c Just like that, NBC threw Joy and me under the bus. It killed her story and\u2014at least temporarily\u2014silenced me. \u201d\n\nTwo more months of back and forth over email would occur before it became clear that NBC had no intention of airing my interview. The last time I spoke with Joy was on April 6, 2018, when she called to tell me that senior management had stopped responding to her inquiries about her piece on me. She said I should take the story elsewhere.\n\nJust like that, NBC threw Joy and me under the bus. It killed her story and\u2014at least temporarily\u2014silenced me.\n\nNBCUniversal declined to comment for this story. A New York magazine spokesperson said that they did not publish the written piece because Reid withdrew it.\n\nTwo weeks after my final call with Joy, I was referred to Kim Masters at The Hollywood Reporter. She and I communicated for the first time on April 26, 2018. Two months later, on June 28, The Hollywood Reporter broke the news of my allegations against Russell Simmons and A.J. Calloway, along with the cover-up of my story by NBC.\n\nMasters provided the following statement: \u201cJoy\u2019s reporting was extremely thorough. While obviously I had to review everything, she laid out an excellent roadmap. Everything checked and we published. The story was ready to go.\u201d\n\nI am one of the many survivors that NBC silenced, and bore witness to how it treated one of their top talents for trying to break a story on sexual predators. Given what has been exposed thus far by Farrow and others, it\u2019s clear that NBC thinks it can spin their way out of this\u2014again. What it fails to recognize is that this is a much bigger issue than their cover-ups, payoffs, and excuses. The media is supposed to be a watchdog for abuses of power. Reporting on the behavior of alleged serial predators is more than news. It\u2019s an act of social good.\n\nActions have consequences. Inaction does as well. In their response to the Hollywood Reporter piece, NBC claimed it didn\u2019t have enough on one of my assailants to air my interview. Yet at the time my account was published, at least a dozen women had already accused Simmons of attempted sexual assault or rape. Despite what the network said, they had enough on Calloway and still held the story. Once my story became public, close to a dozen women reached out to tell me their own stories of alleged sexual victimization at the hands of Calloway. In the absence of publication, these women never would have known they weren\u2019t the only ones he had assaulted. Each of these brave survivors would have gone to their graves thinking they were the only one he attacked, when in fact their assaults are part of a pattern of alleged sexual predation by Calloway that goes back decades.\n\nMisogyny and protectionism of alleged serial rapists is not simply an NBC issue. I lobbied Calloway\u2019s parent company, Warner Media, for close to a year before it took action. It took four other stories, including one by The Daily Beast, before it finally did an investigation into Calloway\u2019s behavior.\n\nAfter The Hollywood Reporter ran my story, Simmons sold all his U.S. properties and moved to Bali, a country without an extradition treaty with our country. Warner Media severed ties with Calloway, who is no longer employed by Extra. He is also currently under investigation for rape in two states.\n\nThe media is supposed to be a watchdog for abuses of power. Yet, what we have seen over and over again with NBC is its use of its power to protect those in power. Initially, I thought that NBC failed to act on my story because I\u2019m a black woman, and my assailants were black as well (it is well-documented that mainstream media outlets ignore accusations of sexual assault lobbed at black men unless their victims are mainly white, as in the case of Bill Cosby). I thought maybe it decided to pass on my story because Calloway\u2019s show Extra aired on NBC affiliates and a negative story about someone whose program airs on their network could hurt NBC\u2019s bottom line.\n\nRecently, however, there has been a spate of stories about sexual misconduct in the upper echelons of the company: Noah Oppenheim\u2019s misogynistic Harvard Crimson pieces, Andy Lack\u2019s predation of underlings, MSNBC head Phil Griffin showing a photo of Maria Menounos\u2019 genitalia in a staff meeting. The issue at NBC is larger than what I\u2019d feared about its reporting policies on assaults committed against women of color. What we have seen over and over again with NBC is its use of its power to protect those in power. This entire sordid mess is solely about power and NBC's choice to side with those in possession of it. NBC is a media conglomerate with tentacles that expand the globe. It has the power to make or break careers and lives. Again and again, it has shown that when it comes down to breaking news on the sexual abuse of women by men who also have power, it will protect assailants under the guise of \u201cnot meeting standards and practices.\u201d\n\nOppenheim and Lack continue to make the rounds internally and externally claiming innocence and due diligence. The frat boy rape apologist. The serial sexual harasser. These are the people at NBC who are the arbiters of justice and injustice. Yet what is lost in this endless discussion about who knew what and when is a grave truth: NBC put women\u2019s lives at risk. This is one of the darkest of NBC\u2019s sins. By refusing to stand by their hard-working reporters\u2019 work, it knowingly placed members of the public in harm\u2019s way. By discrediting and minimizing the strength of allegations, NBC is complicit in maintaining structures of gender inequality and rape culture. The bottom line is this: it kept dangerous men from being held accountable.\n\nFarrow\u2019s PBS NewsHour interview last week sums up his former networks failures succinctly: \u201cThe New Yorker looked at the same reporting as NBC had\u2026 and four weeks later it was a Pulitzer Prize-winning story. So people can decide if the reporting had valid journalistic grounds. I think it\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d\n\nMe too.", "description": "Sil Lai Abrams writes about how her story detailing rape allegations against Russell Simmons and A.J.
