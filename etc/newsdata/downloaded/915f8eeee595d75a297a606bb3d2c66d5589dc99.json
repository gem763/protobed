I fully believe it,\u201d he wrote in the photos\u2019 caption. \u201cI have not seen a single salmon in a river so far. The bears are starving and it breaks my heart seeing this unfold.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI believe it is important to show this side too,\u201d Mr Hicker continued. \u201cHere in the Broughton is no salmon left for the bears (and whales I must assume?). Advertising still shows the happy bears feasting on salmon, well, sorry to say - not here. We saw this sow with her two little ones a couple of weeks ago and then we saw her again only a few days ago. I have no idea how she would make it through the winter without salmon.\u201d\n\nMr Hicker is correct about the salmon run. In August, a report released by Fisheries and Oceans Canada said that the country\u2019s climate is warming twice as fast as the global average. The doubled time is drastically impacting salmon, which in turn impacts the bears who feed on the fish.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This giraffe will be rehabilitated and return to the wild, as a number of others have done before him. Right now, giraffes are undergoing what has been referred to as a silent extinction. Current estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to under 100,000 today. The decline is thought to be caused by to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know exactly what is happening. Reticulated giraffes themselves number fewer than 16,000 individuals. Scientists are now undertaking major studies to better understand why giraffes are disappearing and what can be done to stop it.

None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them. The young warriors from Northern Rangelands Trust community conservancies had been visiting to learn about conservation practices such as sustainable land use, grazing programs, and endangered species conservation.
