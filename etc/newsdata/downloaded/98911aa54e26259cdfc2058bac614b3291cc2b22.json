Isn\u2019t the real story whether he (Biden) sold out the vice presidency of the United States, not whether I got paid for it?\u201d\n\nReuters was not able to independently verify how Giuliani paid for his trips.\n\nBiden has accused Giuliani of peddling \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nGiuliani traveled to Madrid to meet Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinskiy, a few days after a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Zelinskiy to investigate Biden. Yermak had sought the meeting with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani said that he chose Madrid as the meeting place because he was going to be there anyway on behalf of two clients, whom he declined to name.\n\n\u201cWe were negotiating where to meet. He was going to come to New York. I said Mr. Yermak, I\u2019m going to Madrid for four days, five days. Would it be easier if I met you there? He said yes, so those expenses were paid by I assume one client. Since I took two days off I think I paid some of that personally as well.\u201d\n\nGiuliani did not say what they discussed at that meeting, but a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Zelinksiy made public last week said U.S. officials had characterized the meeting as a \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to the president\u2019s call.Giuliani said he had received no money from Trump\u2019s election campaign or the Republican National Committee, the bureaucratic body that oversees Trump\u2019s Republican Party.\n\nHe said he did not view his work as a \u201cpolitical act.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Donald Trump speaks with former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani as he visits Gettysburg National Military Park, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, U.S. October 22, 2016. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n\u201cThis began almost a year ago, two years before any election, when I heard the allegations about Joe Biden I did not think about them as connected to the 2020 election. At that point he wasn\u2019t even a candidate.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he met a Ukrainian prosecutor in Paris in April or May for further discussions about the firing of Shokin. He added that he had been in the French capital \u201cfor other reasons once again.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he met Shokin\u2019s replacement, Yuriy Lutsenko, in Warsaw in February after first meeting him in New York in January. Giuliani said the meeting with Lutsenko in Warsaw was \u201creally social.\u201d \u201cI think it was either dinner or cigars after dinner. Not opportune for substantive discussion,\u201d he said.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, says he met Ukrainian officials in Madrid, Paris and Warsaw this year as he pushed an investigation into one of Trump's main political rivals in the 2020 presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Karen Freifeld", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435321028&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0VG", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
