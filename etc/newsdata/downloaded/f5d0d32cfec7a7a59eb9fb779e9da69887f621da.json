The law bans teachers, cops and other provincial employees from wearing religious symbols at work and it's popular among Quebecers. But outside that province, Bill 21 faces strong condemnation. So why aren't the federal party leaders vowing to go to court to defend religious freedoms? And if they did... would it be a vote-getter in the rest of Canada? Chris Hall explores those questions with pollster Shachi Kurl, Brampton councillor Gurpreet Dillon and strategist Jason Lietaer. 9:42\n\nWhen it comes to a ban on religious symbols in the workplace, opinions differ based on the particular symbol in question.\n\nIn Quebec and the rest of Canada, for example, a majority of people surveyed said public employees should be allowed to wear a crucifix while on the job. But support drops when the symbols in question relates to the Islamic faith.\n\n\"What we're really talking about is a ban of Muslim religious symbols, particularly the niqab and the burka,\" Kurl said.\n\nThis isn't the first time an opinion poll has suggested Canadians are conflicted on diversity and immigration.\n\nA poll commissioned by CBC News earlier this year found 65 per cent of all Canadians said they agreed with the statement \"we have gone too far in accommodating every group in society\" -- a view held most strongly in Alberta and Quebec.\n\n\"Canadians in general as not as tolerant as they like to think they are. We have some difficult conversations to have,\" said Kurl, adding the Angus Reid Institute will release the results of a comprehensive study that canvassed Canadians on their attitudes toward immigration on Monday.\n\nMay not ruling out supporting Liberal or Conservative minority governments \u2014 yet\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May takes part in The National Presents: Face to Face With the Federal Party Leaders \u2014 a broadcast event giving undecided voters a chance to speak one-on-one with the federal party leaders. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nElizabeth May says she's not ruling out working with any of the parties who might form a minority government after election day.\n\nMay said it's impossible to predict what kind of cooperation could emerge after voting day on Oct. 21 \u2014 softening her previous vow that she wouldn't support a minority government that didn't share Green values on the environment.\n\n\"One can never pre-judge this,\" May told host Chris Hall.\n\nWhen asked which parties she could see herself aligning with, she said she's looking for a partner that is just as committed to fight climate change.\n\n\"I don't assume that the Liberals and the Conservatives are are dedicated to failing on the climate crisis.\"\n\nBut she made another pitch for progressive voters to cast their ballots for the Greens.\n\n\"We just know that the Liberals and the Conservatives and the NDP will let us down.\"\n\nMay previously told CBC News she would refuse to prop up a minority government that moves forward with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\n\nAsked what success would look like for the Greens on election day and her potential plans to step down as leader, May compared Greens to the hobbit characters in the Lord of the Rings novels.\n\n\"We Greens don't think about this in terms of political power,\" she said.\n\n\"If there's if there's a ring that corrupts, you really want to have a hobbit in the room. Don't give it to a Liberal or Conservative, give it to the Greens.\"", "description": "This week on The House, we look at how the rest of Canada views Quebec's religious symbols bill.
