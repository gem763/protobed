(AP) - Antonio Brown\u2019s winding summer odyssey has officially landed him as a member of the New England Patriots.\n\nBut just how the sometimes disgruntled receiver will fit into the Super Bowl champions\u2019 culture has become the Patriots\u2018 biggest focal point in the aftermath of their 33-3 drubbing of the four-time All-Pro\u2019s former team on Sunday night.\n\nBrown\u2019s signing was announced by the Patriots late in the afternoon on Monday.\n\nAccording to Brown\u2019s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, the receiver signed a one-year deal, which will guarantee him $9 million this season and the potential to earn as much as $15 million.\n\nIt\u2019s far short of the money Brown lost following his short tenure with the Oakland Raiders , that ended with the team voiding more than $29 million guaranteed money and releasing him.\n\nBut it opened the door for Patriots coach Bill Belichick to swoop in and take a chance on a talented player that could help take a receiving groups surrounded by questions in the preseason to one of the most formidable in the NFL.\n\nBrown was not present in the locker room during the period open to reporters on Monday. Of the players that did talk, few were willing to talk about their new teammate.\n\n\u201cFriendly guy,\u201d offensive lineman Joe Thuney said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest gamble by Belichick, who has previously brought in castoffs such as Randy Moss and Corey Dillon to mixed results. Moss gave New England three straight seasons of 1,000 receiving yards and 47 receiving touchdowns from 2007 to 2009 in his Hall of Fame career. Dillion ran for 1,635 yards in the 2004 season to help New England win its third Super Bowl in a four-season span.\n\nWithout Brown, the Patriots looked every bit like a team primed to make a run at another Lombardi Trophy in dismantling the Steelers.\n\nAt age 42, Tom Brady continued to defy his age with a 341-yard, three-touchdown game, spreading the ball around to seven players. It ended preseason questions about who Brady would throw to following the retirement of tight end Rob Gronkowski and with only reigning Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman to lead a young group of receivers.\n\nWith Brown, the 11-time defending AFC East champs have two of the most athletic receivers in the league. They recently got back Josh Gordon following his reinstatement for violations of the league\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\nTogether, Brown and Gordon give Brady proven deep threats to go along with the sure-handed Edelman in the slot.\n\nThat is, if Brown can avoid the pitfalls that caused him to fall out of favor with each of his two previous teams.\n\n\u201cI think people understand when you come here you can\u2019t really make mistakes or do things that can be distractions for the team,\u201d Patriots running back Rex Burkhead said. \u201cYou gotta lock in, buy in and understand it\u2019s a team atmosphere and there\u2019s goals ahead.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe run defense. Linebackers Dont\u2019a Hightower, Jamie Collins and John Simon limited the Steelers, leaving them one-dimensional for most of the game. For the game Pittsburgh managed just 2.5 yards per rush.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe Patriots went 0 for 3 in the red zone against Pittsburgh. It\u2019s something the offense will need to improve upon as the season progresses. But it will be moot if Brady and the offense keep having games in which each of their touchdowns come from 20 or more yards.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nReceiver Phillip Dorsett has acknowledged that it took time for him to feel completely comfortable in the Patriots offense after he was traded from Indianapolis in 2017.\n\nHe appears to have found his groove. Dorsett had four catches for 95 yards and two touchdowns - including a 58-yard TD reception against the Steelers. It was the first multi-score game of his career.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nTed Karras may need a few games to get used to his new role at starting center with David Andrews on injured reserve with blood clots in his lung. Belichick said Karras showed some inconsistencies getting the ball to Brady with enough velocity in shotgun formations.\n\nINJURED\n\nRight tackle Marcus Cannon left the game late in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury. If he misses time, Thuney could slide over from left guard to right tackle.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n40-0. That is the Patriots\u2018 record at home against AFC teams with Brady and Edelman in the starting lineup together.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAssuming Brown gets up to speed on the playbook enough to be in the lineup for Sunday\u2019s visit to Miami, it would mean somebody would have to sacrifice playing time. Possible candidates include rookie Jakobi Meyers and Dorsett.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Antonio Brown's winding summer odyssey has officially landed him as a member of the New England Patriots.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/raiders_brown_football_73312_c0-0-4168-2430_s1770x1032.jpg?40cf0ff93db6946aea8a4f962f590a5a5be902dc", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
