ANZ and Westpac have announced reduction of 0.18% and 0.20% respectively.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg called on the banks to pass on the cuts in full.\n\nAustralia\u2019s central bank on Tuesday cut official interest rates by 25 basis points, leaving the cash rate at a new record low of 1.25%.\n\nIn response, two of Australia\u2019s big four banks \u2013 the Commonwealth Bank and the National Australia Bank \u2014 have announced they will pass on the rate cut of 0.25% in full for all variable home loans.\n\nA statement from NAB chief customer officer and former NSW premier Mike Baird said it will be NAB\u2019s lowest standard variable rate in 40 years.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe reducing rates is the right thing to do by our customers and reflects our focus on earning trust in the community and rewarding our loyal existing customers,\u201d he said.\n\nBut ANZ and Westpac have bucked the trend, announcing rate cut of just 0.18% and 0.20% respectively despite the announcements made by its two competitors.\n\n\u201cIn making this decision we have weighed up a number of factors, such as business performance, market conditions and the impact on our customers, including our depositors,\u201d said ANZ\u2019s group executive of Australian retail and commercial Mark Hand in a statement on the bank\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognise some home loan customers will be disappointed, in making this decision we have needed to balance the increased cost in managing our business with our desire to provide customers with the most competitive lending and deposit rates possible.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, Westpac had not issued any public response to the RBA decision.\n\nThe announcements follow Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg reportedly meeting with bank top brass to push them to pass on any official interest rate reduction to consumers.\n\n\u201cI expect all banks to pass on the benefits of sustained reductions in funding costs,\u201d Frydenberg said on Tuesday, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nUPDATED 8.22pm 4/6/19: This article was updated to include Westpac\u2019s response to the RBA decision, which had not been released at the original time of publication.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
