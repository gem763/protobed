He says they're concerned about the escalating trade war.\n\n\"Instead we chose to insult our trade allies, pick all sorts of fights with our trade allies,\" Lehman says. \"And then go to China and make outrageous demands that we knew were not going to be met.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has doled out billions of dollars in relief to farmers for taking the brunt of the trade war. It's an economic short-term positive deal to fill in a gap but it doesn't fix a long-term problem of not having access to foreign markets.\n\nWe lifted the restrictions on E-15 just in time to fuel America's summer vacations. We just made it.\n\nBack in June, President Trump came to Council Bluffs, Iowa with an announcement meant to calm those concerns. His administration cleared the way for higher blends of corn-based ethanol. Forty percent of the United States' corn crop goes to ethanol production.\n\n\"We lifted the restrictions on E-15 just in time to fuel America's summer vacations,\" President Trump said to cheers in Council Bluffs. \"We just made it.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIowa's U.S. Senator Joni Ernst and Gov. Kim Reynolds; as well as Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer and Gov. Pete Rickets joined the president for this ceremony in Council Bluffs.\n\nThe president has also granted dozens of waivers to oil refineries exempting them from blending ethanol. That's leading more than 15 ethanol plants to close their doors. Trump recently tweeted he would be unveiling a \"giant package\" that would help these farmers.\n\nBloomberg reported Friday that President Trump has agreed to a tentative plan to offset the waivers, but nothing has been announced.\n\nIowa Democratic Congresswoman Cindy Axne, who faces a tough race for her seat next year, says she'll believe it when she sees it.\n\n\"He said he's the best thing that's ever happened to farmers. And literally two months later had his finger on issuing waivers to Exxon and Chevron, multi-billion dollar companies.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n\nWhile Aaron Lehman didn't vote for Donald Trump in 2016, Iowa soybean farmer Dave Walton did.\n\n\"We can only talk so much before we have to take action and he took action,\" Walton said. \"We really saw this coming. He campaigned on it so, it's no surprise.\"\n\nWalton admits the negotiations have gone on longer than he thought they would and soy-biodiesel has also been affected by those refinery waivers.\n\n\"My vote's still up for grabs,\" Walton says about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nEconomist Ernie Goss at Creighton University says his research shows the president's trade policies are shrinking the rural economy. Goss oversees a monthly survey of rural bank CEOs in the Midwest and Plains.\n\nSeven out of 10 of the bankers he surveyed support either continuing with the tariffs or in some cases raising the tariffs, Goss said. \"Their belief is that the long-term gain will outweigh the short-term pain.\"\n\nThe agriculture economy was already struggling and the trade war is insult to injury that won't be solved overnight, says Iowa State University Agriculture Economist Chad Hart.\n\n\"Trade negotiations, especially in the case of the wide-ranging issues we have with China, take years to get down to a final agreement,\" says.\n\nThat anxiety is something Democrats running for president - like Joe Biden - are talking about in Iowa.\n\nWhen asked last month what he'd say to farmers that are hurting from the tariffs but still want to see Trump making these deals.\n\n\"Well, if you think that's a good deal then vote for Trump then,\" Biden told a group of reporters after a campaign stop in Prole, Iowa. \"But I don't think there are that many farmers that are that slow about things.\"\n\nDemocrats are hoping to peel off some of Trump's support.
