Billy remained at Myerscough Veterinary Group overnight under the close supervision of a nurse.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He couldn\u2019t stand up and even when he was sat on the vinyl flooring in the vets, his legs just splayed out.\n\n\u201cTo other pet owners, just be vigilant. If unsure, seek medical advice immediately. The vet warned us that had we left it to linger \u2013 it had been over four hours since he had eaten the cannabis when we sought help \u2013 the outcome may have been very different.\u201d\n\nMs Eccles wrote on Facebook that Billy \u201cgulped down\u201d a part of two chocolate cookies lying in the grass at her local park. She said she picked up one en route to the vets and returned later that night to dispose of the other.\n\nShe said the cookie was \"laden\" with cannabis, saying \"the smell alone gave it away\", although there was no indication it had been tested to confirm its ingredients.\n\nThe psychoactive substance in cannabis is called THC. In very rare cases it can be fatal to dogs.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

People get high, dogs get poisoned.\u201d\n\nMs Eccles said she decided to release the video of Billy to help other dog owners identify the warning signs for an animal that has ingested cannabis.\n\nMs Smith, the vet who treated Billy, said: \u201cCannabis can be really harmful to dogs and with baked goods, chocolate is toxic to them as well, so we would always advise owners to seek immediate medical attention.\n\n\u201cTreatment very much depends on how much they\u2019ve eaten \u2013 and how long ago since they ate it. If it happened very recently, we can give an emetic injection to make them sick.\n\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s after a few hours, it will already be digested, and we have to explore supportive treatment options. It\u2019s important to seek medical advice as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe RSPCA\u2019s chief veterinary officer Caroline Allen also emphasised the importance of getting to a vet quickly, saying: \u201cThe vet\u2019s priority will always be the animal\u2019s welfare, not where the drugs came from.\u201d\n\n\u201cDogs will always consume things they shouldn\u2019t if it is in the home or while out on walks, so people should never leave things lying around in case of accidental ingestions. It is an offence under the Animal Welfare Act if someone was to deliberately make their animal consume an intoxicating substance.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, several products containing cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis, have been launched for pets, notably by Martha Stewart.\n\nWhile CBD is often promoted as helping to relieve anxiety or physical pain in humans, it remains unclear what effect it could have on dogs.\n\nAdditional reporting by SWNS", "description": "Footage of a\u00a0\u201cstoned\u201d dog who became seriously ill after eating a cannabis edible found during a walk in Lancashire has been released to warn\u00a0other pet owners\u00a0about the drug\u2019s effects.
