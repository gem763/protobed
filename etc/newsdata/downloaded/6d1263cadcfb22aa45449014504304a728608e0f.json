Ted Cruz will meet with liberal actress Alyssa Milano to discuss gun violence after the two of them feuded on Twitter following last weekend's deadly gun rampage in Odessa.\n\nThe clash began on Sunday. That's when Milano responded to state Rep. Matt Shaefer's suggestion that owning a gun is a \"God-given right,\" asking the Republican legislator, \"Can someone cite which passage of the Bible God states it is a god-given right to own a gun?\"\n\nCruz called it an \"excellent\" question and began by pointing to the \"right to Life & the right to Liberty\" and went on to cite a Bible verse.\n\nCHICAGO MAYOR CLASHES WITH CRUZ OVER GUN VIOLENCE: 'KEEP OUR NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH'\n\n\"The right to self-defense is recognized repeatedly in the Bible,\" Cruz wrote, for example, \"Exodus 22:2: 'If a thief is caught breaking in at night & is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed.' (Note, though, Verse 3 says it IS murder if during daylight (ie, not self-defense).\"\n\nPointing to the \"unalienable rights\" of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" within the Declaration of Independence, Cruz said it is \"for that reason that the Second Amendment safeguards the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nTED CRUZ, AOC UNITE FOR 'SUPER-BIZARRE' LEGISLATIVE ALLIANCE\n\n\"Playing politics w/ these deranged crimes \u2014 and trying to use them as an excuse to violate the constl [sic] rights of law-abiding citizens \u2014 won\u2019t make anybody safer,\" Cruz concluded in a Twitter thread. \"Forcible gun confiscation (as some 2020 Dems urge) won\u2019t prevent mass-murders. But it would weaken our self-defense.\"\n\nOn Monday, Milano floated the idea of meeting with the Texas senator to discuss the \"gun issue,\" among other topics, noting that she would be in Washington next week.\n\n\"I\u2019d love to come in and meet with you on the gun issue and many other issues that include life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness... We can live-stream the meeting so the American people can hear your bulls--- 1st hand,\" Milano wrote, adding she'd like to talk about 1 Peter 4:8, which says: \"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.\"\n\nCruz accepted the offer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I\u2019d be happy to sit down & visit next week about uniting to stop gun violence & about the Constitution,\" Cruz responded. \"If we can have a civil & positive conversation -- in the spirit of 1 Peter 4:8 as you suggest -- despite our political differences, that might help resolve the discord in our Nation.\"\n\nFox News' Caleb Parke contributed to this report.", "description": "It appears that\u00a0Sen.
