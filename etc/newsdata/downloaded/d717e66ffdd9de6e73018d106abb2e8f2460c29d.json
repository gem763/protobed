It puts the death toll in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nAnkara was swift to condemn the US vote, summoning the American ambassador to Ankara and calling it a \u201cmeaningless political step\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis step which was taken is worthless and we do not recognise it,\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a televised speech.\n\nTies between Washington and NATO member Turkey have been strained by Ankara\u2019s offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, which came after US forces withdrew from the area.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Historical justice\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe House also passed a measure on Tuesday imposing sanctions on senior Turkish officials involved in the Syria offensive.\n\nThe international recognition of the killings as genocide has long been the top priority of Armenia\u2019s foreign policy, supported by vigorous campaigning by Armenian diasporas around the world.\n\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan hailed the House move, tweeting that it was a \u201cbold step towards serving truth and historical #justice that also offers comfort to millions of descendants of the Armenian Genocide survivors.\u201d\n\nThe Armenian foreign ministry said the resolution was of \u201cprofound significance\u201d and thanked US lawmakers for \u201ctheir overwhelming commitment to truth, justice, humanity and solidarity, and to universal values of human rights.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment was shared by Armenians on the streets of the capital Yerevan.\n\n\u201cI am so happy that the US has finally recognised the Armenian genocide,\u201d said 69-year-old cobbler Koryun Hakobyan.\n\n\u201cOther countries will now follow suit.\u201d\n\nThe hilltop genocide memorial that dominates Yerevan\u2019s skyline draws hundreds of thousands on April 24 each year to mark the anniversary of the start of the tragedy.\n\nIn April 2015, on the centenary of the killings, the Armenian Church conferred sainthood on victims of the massacres.\n\nKim Kardashian, the US reality star who is a prominent member of the Armenian diaspora and visited Yerevan for the 2015 anniversary, hailed the Washington vote on social media.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Anti-Turkey groups\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cWOW LOOK AT THESE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS!!! THE U.S. JUST RECOGNIZED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE!!!!\u201d she wrote in a Tweet to her 62 million followers.\n\nTurkey\u2019s foreign ministry suggested the House measure was the result of domestic politics in the United States, where there are between 500,000 and 1.5 million Americans of Armenian origin.\n\n\u201cIts sole addressees are the Armenian lobby and anti-Turkey groups,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nIn 2017, newly inaugurated US President Donald Trump criticized the killings as \u201cone of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th century,\u201d but in keeping with longstanding US practice he stopped short of using the word genocide.\n\nBefore being elected in 2008, Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama had pledged to recognize the killings as genocide, but ultimately did not do so during his two terms in office.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the truth of the \u201cstaggering crime\u201d had been denied too often.\n\n\u201cToday, let us clearly state the facts on the floor of this House to be etched forever into the Congressional Record: The barbarism committed against the Armenian people was a genocide.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Armenia rejoiced but Turkey was furious on Wednesday after the US House of Representatives passed a historic resolution", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/c35a25_house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-she-was-honored-join-her-colleagues-in-solemn-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
