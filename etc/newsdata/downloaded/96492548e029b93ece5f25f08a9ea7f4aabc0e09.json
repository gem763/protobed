This was her 21st World Championships medal, carrying her past Svetlana Khorkina\u2019s tally of 20.\n\nBy the end of this event, Biles will be far out on her own. She has qualified for all five individual finals and could well repeat her feat from last year\u2019s championships, where she won medals in each of the six events.\n\nHer overall superiority is underlined by that fact that 15 of her medals to date have been gold, whereas no one else has ever won more than nine golds at this level.\n\nThere was never any doubt that the US would come in first on Tuesday, for this was their fifth straight team gold at the worlds. Sure enough, they posted a massive 172.330, almost six marks ahead of Russia in silver-medal position.\n\nItaly surprisingly took the bronze, pipping the Chinese by just over half a mark, while Great Britain came in a creditable sixth.\n\n\u201cI never think of records \u2013 I just go out there and do what I came to do,\u201d Biles said afterwards. \u201cEvery year it feels better and better, just because we\u2019re adding to the legacy.\u201d", "description": "Peerless gymnast Simone Biles set a record by leading the United States to team gold on Tuesday in Stuttgart.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent", "Brian Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212437391-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXfJMPfENEq5oPh9E8lUElbXot50Qc_vM60sRY4jpCKQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
