'Of course, the yellow-red card against Ron is unfortunate,' he added.\n\n'He actually wants to hit the ball out of frustration and then does not hit the ball, but the opponent. That's a yellow card and therefore a red.'\n\nZieler was offered his first professional contract by Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford in 2008\n\nKeeper Zieler (second from left) was part of the Germany squad that won the 2014 World Cup\n\nHannover will miss the experience of a player who has made more than 200 appearances for the club, having begun his career in Manchester United's youth setup between 2005 and 2008.\n\nZieler signed professional forms with then-United manager Sir Alex Ferguson at the end of his apprenticeship, but never made an appearance for the club's senior side.\n\nThe 30-year-old, who was part of Germany's World Cup-winning squad in 2014, spent time on loan at Northampton Town - nicknamed the Cobblers - during the 2008-09 season.\n\nHe returned to Hannover in 2010, becoming a domestic regular and acting as an understudy for Germany during their World Cup triumph in Brazil in 2014, adding football's most prestigious trophy to his six international caps.\n\nZieler returned to the United Kingdom in 2016 when he joined Leicester City for a season\n\nHe made nine appearances for Leicester after returning to England for the 2016-17 season, then joined Stuttgart for two seasons before switching back to Hannover.\n\nSchlaudraff said the performance of man in the middle Guido Winkmann had given Hannover 'nothing to complain about'.\n\nWinkmann, who is an experienced referee across Germany's professional divisions, last produced a dismissal in even more dramatic circumstances.\n\nHe showed Bayern Munich's Niklas Sule a straight red card during the champions' 5-4 home win in front of 75,000 people at the Allianz Arena in the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal cup competition in April.\n\nZieler also won the European Under-19 Championship with Germany in 2008 but has not appeared for his country since 2015.", "description": "The former Manchester United and Leicester goalkeeper accidentally caught goalscorer Daniel Gordon in a painful area during the Bundesliga 2 match, earning a red card for his low blow.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/13/20243962-0-image-a-10_1572181531266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
