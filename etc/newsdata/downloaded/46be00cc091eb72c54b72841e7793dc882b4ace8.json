Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the United States could \u201cshut down the Turkish economy.\u201d But Trump has limited the financial punishment for the Turkish invasion. He has imposed sanctions on a handful of current and former Turkish officials, doubled tariffs on imports of Turkish steel and halted negotiations aimed at increasing trade between the two countries.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is mostly bluster,\u201d said economist Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nSeparately, federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Tuesday charged a state-owned Turkish bank with participating in a massive scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. Turkiye Halk Bankasi, known as Halkbank, was accused of fraud, money laundering, and sanctions violations in connection with efforts to give Iran access to \u201cbillions of dollars worth\" of oil revenue, said Geoffrey S. Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nAD\n\nThat prosecution is the outgrowth of a long-running federal investigation, which already has resulted in a January 2018 guilty verdict against a top Halkbank official.\n\nBut Congress also may force the president to follow through on his tougher talk. Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) are pushing for an early Senate vote on a sanctions package that would target Erdogan as well as Turkey\u2019s energy and military industries.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, the president insisted he was cracking down on the Turkish leader. \u201cWe\u2019re being very tough on Turkey. \u2026We put the strongest sanctions you can imagine but they get a lot, we have a lot in store if they don\u2019t have an impact, including massive tariffs on steel,\" the president said at the White House.\n\nAD\n\nTrump already has the power to do more. Under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), he could prevent Americans from investing in any Turkish company or security and move to prevent the International Monetary Fund and World Bank from aiding the country.\n\nSince last year\u2019s crisis, Ankara has treated its battered economy to lavish government spending and easy lending by domestic banks. Exports and tourism have benefited from the weaker lira, which makes Turkish goods less expensive for foreign customers.\n\nAD\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reductions, which began in July, also have eased pressure on Turkey and other emerging markets. The bigger the gap between U.S. and Turkish rates, the more capital is sucked out of Turkey and into American investments.\n\nAD\n\nWhile it continues to heal, the Turkish economy is barely growing. The IMF said last month it expects Turkey to grow at a rate of just 0.25 percent this year.\n\nThe president\u2019s order to \u201cimmediately stop negotiations, being led by the Department of Commerce, with respect to a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey,\u201d drew the most attention in Monday\u2019s White House announcement.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month traveled to Ankara and Istanbul for several days of talks aimed at facilitating greater trade between the NATO allies.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has pledged to President Erdogan that we will become even more important partners, and that trade and investment are central to our relationship,\u201d Ross said in a speech to a business group in Ankara.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe United States and Turkey have a tradition of working together, and we want to make sure that it not only continues, but expands long into the future,\u201d he added.\n\nThe U.S. and Turkish business communities have high hopes for expanded trade. But halting these efforts will have little genuine impact, especially in the short run. The $100 billion figure Trump cited was a goal for U.S.-Turkish trade that he and Erdogan had agreed to at the Group of 20 summit in Japan several months ago.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be well over $100 billion soon,\u201d Trump said with Erdogan by his side at the Osaka meeting.\n\nBut with total merchandise trade between the two countries today at just $20 billion, achieving the $100 billion target was unlikely, analysts said. There are no formal negotiations aimed at a comprehensive trade agreement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is unrealistic that we were going to quintuple trade with Turkey, and it is dishonest to then claim we won\u2019t do what was impossible anyway and feel that we are punishing Erdogan,\u201d said Michael Rubin, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThat\u2019s the trade equivalent of putting Turkey on double-secret probation.\u201d\n\nBut Rubin said Trump could damage Turkey\u2019s already shaky economy, which is slowly recovering from last year\u2019s currency crisis. Trump\u2019s first round of steel tariffs on Turkey last August accelerated a 40 percent plunge in the lira that began several months earlier.\n\nThe United States is the fourth-largest buyer of Turkish steel, consuming about 5 percent of the country\u2019s output, according to the International Trade Administration.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey ship a lot of steel to the United States. They make a lot of money shipping steel \u2013 they won\u2019t be making so much money,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAmong the tariff casualties will be the U.S. operations of Borusan Mannesmann, one of Turkey\u2019s largest steelmakers. The company\u2019s Baytown, Tex., plant imports Turkish steel, which it uses to produce pipe for the oil and gas industry.\n\nStill, as Turkish military units fan out across parts of northern Syria that, until recently, the United States patrolled, Trump promised Monday that \u201cbig sanctions on Turkey\u201d would be forthcoming. What\u2019s been announced to date doesn\u2019t qualify, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe Turks will not be too bothered by the sanctions Trump put forward compared to what he said he would do,\u201d said Bulent Aliriza, a former Turkish Cypriot diplomat now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThese are not likely to have much of an impact.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "", "authors": ["David J.
