Hart and Black's fiancee, Rebecca Broxterman, were also in the car as passengers.\n\nThe car then careened down an embankment and slammed into a tree, the report said. Evidence from an examination of the Plymouth suggested no one had been wearing seatbelts.\n\n\"I have nothing but love for Jared and wish him and Rebecca a speedy recovery,\" Hart said in a statement released through his attorney later Thursday.\n\nKEVIN HART'S CAR WAS SUPPOSEDLY MISSING KEY SAFETY FEATURES: REPORT\n\nAuthorities previously said that Hart, 40, and Black, 28, suffered major back injuries while Broxterman, 31, had less serious injuries.\n\nHart's attorney, Andrew Brettler, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the actor is doing OK, still recovering from his injuries and doing physical therapy at home.

The sides were also smashed, and some doors couldn't be opened.\n\nBlack and Broxterman were trapped inside and had to be removed by first responders, who took them to a hospital.\n\nHart got out of the car and quickly left the scene, the report said. The CHP previously said he headed to his nearby home seeking medical help, and was later also hospitalized.\n\nA witness who saw the crash called 911 and said a man who appeared to be Hart \"looked like he's hurting,\" according to a recording previously released by the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHart, a Philadelphia native who became a standup comedy standout and in recent years has emerged as a major movie star. \u201cJumanji: The Next Level\u201d is scheduled for release in December.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Kevin Hart issued a statement about the car accident that left him and others severely injured as California Highway Patrol released details of its investigation into the crash.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/AP19009530629978.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
