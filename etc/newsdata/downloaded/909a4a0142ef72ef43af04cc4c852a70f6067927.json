From the teenager who suffered a cardiac arrest after playing PUBG for six hours straight to the World Health Organisation declaring gaming disorders as a disease, the quest to win the chicken dinner is taking a serious toll on the health of PUBG players. Now, a teenager in the district of Wanaparthy in Hyderabad has suffered a stroke after playing an excessive amount of PUBG.\n\nTurns out, gaming for too long can cause a condition called thrombosis or a brain blood clot, according to doctors at the Sunshine hospital in Hyderabad, who diagnosed this 19-year old student on August 26 after his right hand and leg went numb. While such brain strokes, which cut off the oxygen and blood supply to the brain, usually occur among older people, they rarely happen to someone so young, and in this case, doctors are attributing it to the teenager\u2019s PUBG addiction.\n\nThe doctors also say that because his entire focus was on winning the game, he would often skip meals, which lead to acute weight loss, nutrition deprivation and dehydration.\u201c The condition led to thickening of venous blood in the brain and few clots were developed,\u201d Dr K Vinod Kumar, senior Nutri-physician at Sunshine hospital told The Times of India.\n\nThe teenage gamer\u2019s mother also opened up about her son\u2019s undying love for PUBG, saying he would start around 9 pm and play endlessly till 3-4 am, pausing only when he had to go for his part-time job as a newspaper delivery boy. He is a student in his second year of a Bachelor\u2019s programme but would find time to play PUBG during his college breaks as well.\n\nWhile this teenager has now recovered and been discharged from the hospital, he is yet another victim on a long list of people growing mindlessly addicted to the game. In fact, an alarming number of young people are playing competitive killing games, that are leading to symptoms like headaches, vomiting, stiffness, listlessness and irritability. Psychologists even say that taking away these teenagers\u2019 mobile phones to prevent them from playing PUBG has also lead to aggressive withdrawal symptoms, including reports of suicide.\n\nWhile PUBG was briefly banned in the Indian state of Gujarat, countries like Nepal and Iraq have taken severe steps to keep it banned because of all the negative effects linked to it.\n\nHowever, some studies, including one by Oxford University, found that playing such games can be cathartic and aren\u2019t directly linked to a long-term tendency of anger or violence.\n\nFollow Shamani Joshi on Instagram.", "description": "The 19-year old\u2019s gaming addiction caused a brain blood clot, acute weight loss and dehydration that landed him in the hospital.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha", "David Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6e21fcfffff30008ddfd60/lede/1567499009332-Teenager-suffers-brain-stroke-after-playing-too-much-PUBG.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
