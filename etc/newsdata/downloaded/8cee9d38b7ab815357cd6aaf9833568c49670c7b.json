It started with one offhand remark from someone \u2014 probably meant to be helpful, but it felt like a criticism \u2014 which then snowballed into me becoming super-sensitive to every subsequent interaction. I knew I wasn\u2019t being rational, but I couldn\u2019t shake it.\n\nWhen I awoke the next morning, a cloud of self-doubt still hovering, it felt like a good time to finally try the Lord Jones CBD Formula Tincture sitting on my dresser. Made with hemp-derived CBD, it was created to promote a sense of calm and well-being. I placed the recommended dropper-full under my tongue for 60 seconds before swallowing it, and headed out for the day.\n\nBy lunchtime, the realization that I was in a much better mood hit me. More specifically, my hyper-sensitivity had lifted. There really is no other way to describe it. No great moments had occurred to raise my spirits, but they were, indeed, raised. I wasn\u2019t high or giddy. I was just \u2026 good.\n\nBut maybe it was a fluke. Maybe the fact that the E train was pulling into the station the minute I went through the turnstile that morning had something to do with it, or the compliments I received about my Lincoln jumpsuit. So I tried the tincture a few more times over the next few weeks, and \u2014 yep \u2014 those days always felt lighter. It\u2019s important to point out here that my moods never felt dangerously, despondently low when I reached for the drops, and neither Lord Jones nor I are making any kind of pharmaceutical claims here. But now I understand why so many people incorporate hemp-derived CBD into their daily lives.\n\nI can\u2019t promise that the one drop I take will lighten your mood, nor can Lord Jones. And that is the most confusing fact about CBD to me: Since our endocannabinoid systems are unique to each of us, they are balanced subjectively. The amount that works for you might not work for me. Think wine: I take three sips and I\u2019m tipsy, but it might take three glasses for you, and I\u2019m not judging. So you might need two or three drops, or maybe just half a drop, while I found my sweet spot at one. But once you do find your dosage, the calm should happen.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "A review of Lord Jones CBD Tincture.
