We're on to them now.\"\n\nMurray went on to describe Canadian humour as \"drier\" and recalled his time performing before Canadian audiences.\n\n\"I worked at the Second City in Toronto for six weeks,\" he said. \"I could never understand: they didn't laugh as much, but they clapped like crazy at the end.\"\n\nMurray said he'd noticed another difference with Canadians.\n\n\"And they're sillier. They're definitely sillier,\" he said. \"They just like sillier comedy... they're daffier. They're wackier.\"", "description": "Canadian audiences didn't laugh as hard but \"clapped like crazy\" at the end of Second City shows, the American comic actor said in 1981.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5270459.1567623544!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bill-murray.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
