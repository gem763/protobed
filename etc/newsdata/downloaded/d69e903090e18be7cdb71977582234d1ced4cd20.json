Or do you love a baby on a plane, too?", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m not easily offended, but some things \u2014 such as not being able to take my dogs into the Post Office (why?) \u2014 irritate me. Take this new initiative from Japan Airlines.\n\nPassengers choosing their seats online are now able to see the location of children under the age of two \u2014 in order, presumably, to avoid sitting near them.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but what? The parents of young children have a hard enough time travelling without the aviation equivalent of the black spot placed upon them. It\u2019s not only incredibly rude, it\u2019s discriminatory.\n\nSarah Vine said that Japan Airlines' move to label where babies will sit on flights is both discriminatory and rude. (Stock image)\n\nWhat have babies ever done to anyone, apart from have lovely soft cheeks and pudgy little hands and smell like biscuits?\n\nOK, they do sometimes make a racket, but nothing that can\u2019t be sorted with headphones or ear-plugs.\n\nGranted, perhaps being seated next to a crying baby is not ideal, but then neither is having to share a row with some half-cut stag party, or, as happened to me recently, someone who spends the entire trip watching porn on his mobile phone.\n\nThe point about flying is that when you\u2019re all squished together in a metal tube hurtling through the air at 30,000ft, everyone, even your most beloved, is intensely annoying. Why single out babies?\n\nAs the mother of two teenagers, babies remind me of a more innocent time. I am that woman you see making googly eyes at other people\u2019s infants.\n\nSo I\u2019m grateful to Japan Airlines for its policy. If ever I take to the skies with them, I\u2019ll find the nearest baby and sit next to it, hopeful that I, affection-starved granny-in-waiting that I am, will get a few seconds with an adorable small person.", "description": "SARAH VINE: I'm not easily offended, but some things - such as not being able to take my dogs into the Post Office (why?) - irritate me.
