Or that exact point in the afternoon (usually around 3pm) when the only thing that can get you through 'til the end of the day is a snack. It's even more prevalent during the winter months, when a lot of us are feeling the gloomy effects of less sunlight and choose to stay in watching television at night rather than socialise after dark.\n\nThis is called 'emotional eating' and we all do it at some point or another. But what if there was a way we could curb our urge to reach for the snacks when we hit boredom? Or make healthier choices in the evening, so we don't instantly put on weight the moment the temperature drops? Well fear not, for there's a really simple tweak you can make to your weekly routine that has been proven to stress levels, encourage healthier eating choices and lessen the chance of emotional eating. It's probably something you've already dabbled in from time to time, but perhaps haven't made part of your daily routine. Yes, we're talking about yoga.\n\nBenefits of yoga\n\nYoga has long been touted for it's mental health benefits, as well as being responsible for creating the long, lean bodies of many of your favourite celebrities. But now new information has come to light regarding it's ability to not just provide an hour of weekly zen, but also prevent you from consuming too much fast food, control your emotional eating and increase the likelihood of partaking in general physical activity. Sounds like a win win to us!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWell, according to The International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, since yoga is a known stress-reliever, practising this on a regular basis means having less cortisol (the stress hormone) roaming around your body, which in turn helps manage the way we usually would turn to food as a comfort at the end of a long day, or when we feel a low point during the afternoon. By having less cortisol in our system, we change the way we react to stressful situations.\n\n\"Yoga is successful for promoting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours. Those that partake in yoga are less likely to snack, have less frequent fast food consumptions and greater management of emotional eating.\"\n\n\n\nSo, by re-wiring our brains to use other coping mechanisms to deal with our emotions, we'll also make healthier choices when we do eat and stick to designated meal times, rather than panic snacking in search of a serotonin boost or a 'quick-fix'.\n\nThe results?\n\nBy adding yoga into our weekly (or daily) routine, we could potentially stop snacking, make healthier choices when feeling emotionally drained and up our daily physical activity in other ways. Subsequently losing weight and feel lighter all round.
