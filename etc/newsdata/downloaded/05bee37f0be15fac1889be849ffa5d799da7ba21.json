So a lot of people are watching it less and less.\u201d\n\n\"We are all getting squeezed in reality TV but there is plenty of money in the industry,\" Collins said. \"If HBO Max can pay $500 million or whatever they paid for \u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019 then certainly reality TV producers can be paid a fair wage too.\"\n\nWithout a script, it is up to the producer to create engaging plotlines for reality shows like \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" or \"Project Runway.\" But the reality producer is not compensated the same as a writer on a scripted series who may enjoy residuals for years after writing a show.\n\n\"I am getting paid for my creative ideas and storytelling powers, then when the show airs on streaming services here or overseas, all these companies and networks are getting paid off of my work, I don't,\" Collins said. \"I don't get any residual payments for my work even though my episodes of 'Project Runway' are on Hulu right now, people watch them, and I don't get any money from that.\"\n\nResiduals would be just the beginning of creating a more fair wage for producers.\n\n\"Budgets are getting smaller and smaller. So in order to continue to make a profit, they are taking out the smaller budgets on the people who are working on the shows. This is not just happening to story producers, but to field producers, editors and all positions on shows,\u201d Collins said.\n\nAnother part of the problem for freelance producers in Hollywood is that there is no organization amongst workers. A union for reality show producers could be part of the solution, he said.\n\n\"With reality producers, there is no union, so there is no set level of payment; there is no one checking on our working conditions,\" Collins said. \"The production company will offer someone $1100 for a producer job that should earn $2500 a week because they know someone will take it. They will think they are doing you a favor just because they are offering you a job producing Kardashians, but it really isn't a fair wage.\u201c\n\nBenefits, insurance and retirement are also a concern for producers like Collins.\"Most of us are freelance, so we are paying for health insurance out of pocket, we don't get paid time off, no 401k, so having some sort of traveling set of benefits would be beneficial too.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"I really love what I do, I love my job, I love making television, this is what I dreamed about as a child which is why I got in the industry in the first place, but I also want to be a good example of how people should be treated,\" Collins said.", "description": "Reality TV producers face unfair working conditions and low wages.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Kardashians-GettyImages-492404680.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
