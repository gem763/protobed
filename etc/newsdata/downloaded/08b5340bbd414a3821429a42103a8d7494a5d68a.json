USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 They will show up for Game 4 of this National League Championship Series, because technically, they\u2019re still alive, and because compete is what they do, and it\u2019d certainly be bad form if the the Washington Nationals moved on, unopposed, to their first World Series berth.\n\nBut right now, the St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 NLCS appearance has been in name only \u2013 a disappearing act at best and, at worst, one of the all-time most futile offensive showings in postseason history.\n\nCombine their 8-1 defeat in Game 3 on Monday night at Nationals Park with their 2-0 loss in Game 1 and 3-1 defeat in Game 2 and these Cardinals own a most dubious mark: Fewest runs scored through three games of any League Championship Series.\n\nROBLES: Nationals' young CF comes through in return from injury\n\nALCS: After spurning Yankees in 2008, Gerrit Cole can break hearts again\n\nIn fact, you have to go back to the 1966 World Series for any team to match the Cardinals\u2019 three-game futility in a best-of-seven series.\n\nThat year, the Baltimore Orioles held the Los Angeles Dodgers to two runs in a four-game sweep, and Dave McNally and Jim Palmer are still celebrated for it to this day.\n\nNo doubt, Nationals starters Anibal Sanchez, Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg may one day be as revered for their performance in this NLCS as those Orioles are for their exploits then.\n\nBut we\u2019ll have time to memorialize these Nationals. Let\u2019s ponder, for a moment, these Cardinals and their ignominious place in history.\n\nThey\u2019ve been blanked in 25 of 27 innings this series, and the lone runs came thanks to Nationals missteps \u2013 a line drive center fielder Michael A. Taylor misjudged into a double in the eighth inning of Saturday\u2019s Game 2, and a slip-and-fall followed by a bad throw left fielder Juan Soto that enabled an unearned run to score in the seventh inning of Monday\u2019s Game 3.\n\nYadier Molina looks on from the dugout during the Game 3 loss. (Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nDid an NLCS appearance really happen if you never took a lead?\n\nUnless they flip the script on dominant lefty Patrick Corbin in Tuesday\u2019s Game 4, the Cardinals may find out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the lead. We\u2019ve got to get a lead at some point in this series,\u201d said manager Mike Shildt, who was merely stating the obvious but also can be excused for that sin in his hour of desperation. \u201cHard to win a game if you can\u2019t get the lead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play with a lead.\u201d\n\nBaby steps: The Cardinals rapped out seven hits in Game 3, this after getting no-hit for 7 \u2153 innings by Sanchez in Game 1, and for six innings by Scherzer in Game 2.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to score with a nonexistent top of the order. Leadoff man Dexter Fowler struck out three times against Strasburg \u2013 on three, four and three pitches \u2013 and is 0 for 11 with six strikeouts in the series.\n\nNo. 2 hitter Kolten Wong is 0 for 10.\n\nNo. 3 hitter Paul Goldschmidt broke up Scherzer\u2019s Game 2 no-hitter, but beyond that \u2013 hitless in his other 11 at-bats, with four Game 3 strikeouts.\n\n\u201cIt starts with me,\u201d says Goldschmidt, who slugged 34 home runs this season. \u201cI haven\u2019t really done anything this series and the results speak for themselves, especially tonight.\n\n\u201cTwo runs in three games \u2013 it\u2019s tough to have a lead. Our pitchers have done well. (Game 3 starter) Jack (Flaherty) did well. It\u2019s tough to keep doing that when you don\u2019t have the support.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe this is the same team that scored 10 first-inning runs and 13 in all to snuff the Atlanta Braves out quickly in Game 5 of the NL Division Series, sending the Cardinals home to start this NLCS with significant confidence.\n\nBut there is no Mike Foltynewicz in this series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely better pitching than the Braves,\u201d said Cardinals outfielder Jose Martinez, who has four of the Cardinals\u2019 11 hits in the NLCS, and will earn a second start in Game 4. \u201cThey are three of the best pitchers in the big leagues.\n\n\u201cOf course, you have to go out there and do your best to try to hit the ball.\u201d\n\nAnd therein lies the rub: Sanchez is really good, Scherzer a future Hall of Famer and Strasburg now sports a 1.10 career postseason ERA, with 57 strikeouts to five walks in 41 innings.\n\nYet at some point, you have to compete, right?\n\n\u201cAs we tip our hat,\u201d says Shildt, \u201cwe\u2019ve also got to say that we didn\u2019t expect to have scored two runs in three games by any stretch of the imagination. Like I said, we respect our opponent.\n\n\u201cBut by no means did we have anywhere close to the expectation that we would be pretty much shut down.\u201d\n\nTuesday, they\u2019ll face Corbin, who gave up no earned runs and struck out 11 in a September start at Busch Stadium. Shildt says there \u201cis no concession speech\u201d being given, though Corbin may do the honors himself.\n\n\u201cThey signed him this offseason because they expect him to be the guy he is right now,\u201d Wong said of Corbin. \u201cWe\u2019re a little flustered with trying to figure out how to get there, but we know how good we are.\n\n\u201cOnce we get going, man, this team, we steamroll.\u201d\n\nRight now, they\u2019re merely flattened.", "description": "St. Louis has managed just two runs through the first three games of the NLCS and find themselves in a 3-0 hole.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
