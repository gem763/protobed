According to two MEPs who participated in that meeting, all groups except for Goulard's own Renew Europe asked for a set of three additional questions to be sent out that will focus on legal and ethical concerns.\n\n\"There was almost unanimity to draft questions,\" said Virginie Joron, a French far-right MEP. \"The only ones who voted against the questions were from Renew Europe.\"\n\n\"The problems raised are clearly the issues of transparency and integrity,\" Joron added.\n\nPolish MEP Marek Krasnod\u0119bsk from the European Conservatives and Reformists confirmed that MEPs will submit more written questions to Goulard.\n\nThe rejection of Goulard would be a tremendous blow for Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, who has already seen the Parliament block two of her nominees, the Hungarian and Romanian candidates, because of ethical concerns.\n\nGoulard failing to win confirmation would also be a serious embarrassment for French President Emmanuel Macron, who is close to her and used his political muscle to make sure that she would have a broad, influential portfolio overseeing the EU internal market. Macron has sought to portray himself, and his political family Renew Europe, as leading a renovation of the EU and its institutions.\n\nGoulard appeared before MEPs from the industry and internal market committees, both in charge of issues covered by her vast portfolio spanning industrial, defense and digital policy.\n\nAt her hearing, Goulard faced repeated and relentless questioning over allegations that European Parliament assistants were used for domestic political work. She was also grilled over her work as a highly paid consultant for a U.S. think tank while she was an MEP.\n\nGoulard promised to \u201crespect the outcome\u201d of the legal probe into her use of assistants, insisted she was \u201cclean\u201d and called on MEPs to respect her \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d\n\nAsked if she would resign from the European Commission if convicted in that probe, she said: \u201cI will obviously respect that sort of outcome, but for now it is a hypothetical question.\u201d\n\nBut Goulard struggled to convince MEPs about the legal investigation and her job at the Berggruen Institute while she was a MEP. The California-based think tank, headed by businessman Nicolas Berggruen, paid Goulard more than \u20ac10,000 per month before taxes to act as a \"special adviser.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a cloud of doubt hanging over the candidacy of Sylvie Goulard,\u201d Christian Ehler, the EPP coordinator of the industry committee, said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t answer to a lot of questions ... on her legal allegations in France but also in the EU.\u201d\n\nAn official from the Socialists and Democrats group had the same analysis.\n\nVille Ninist\u00f6, coordinator for the Greens/EFA group in the industry committee, said before the group meeting: \"We will request a second round of written questions to her; mainly to clarify what kind of concrete legislative proposals she wants to put on the table to strengthen the circular economy and to properly fix the aftermath of the Dieselgate scandal.\"\n\nIf the committees are still not satisfied once Goulard has answered the new written questions, the Parliament\u2019s Conference of Presidents \u2014 the president of the assembly and the leaders of the political groups \u2014 can arrange another hearing.\n\nGoulard, a close, early ally of Macron, resigned as French defense minister in June 2017 following a legal investigation into her use of assistants during her time as an MEP. Since then, she paid back \u20ac45,000 she owed to the Parliament but, while she hasn't been formally charged, she hasn't been cleared as part of the legal investigation in France and by OLAF, the EU's anti-corruption watchdog.\n\nThe hearing left some MEPs unconvinced.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, a French member of the EPP, started the hearing by asking whether Goulard was \u201ctaking seriously\u201d her mandate. \u201cHow do we understand that what made you step aside from the government in France doesn\u2019t prevent you from exercising with the peace and independence required for a commissioner job?\"\n\nJoron, from far-right National Rally, asked about the Berggruen job: \u201cMadam, how many French people earn \u20ac13,000 to make phone calls?\u201d\n\nPressed further about that by lawmakers, Goulard said that she \u201cregrets\u201d the situation and \u201cunderstands much better\u201d why the money \u201ccould have upset people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI admit that these amounts are high,\u201d Goulard said, while defending the think tank job as a way to \u201cdo things with people who have influence and talent.\u201d\n\nHer political group sought to defend her after the hearing.\n\n\"She is the right person at the right place, to drive the key portfolio of the internal market,\" Dita Charanzov\u00e0, vice president of the Parliament and Renew Europe coordinator for the internal market committee, said after the hearing.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nLaurens Cerulus and David Herszenhorn contributed reporting.", "description": "French nominee runs into fierce opposition to her candidacy during her confirmation hearing.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173076774-1200x628.jpg"}
