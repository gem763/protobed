(AP) \u2014 Californians on Wednesday found themselves facing winds, wildfires, and darkness from yet another power outage that hit more than 1 million people.\n\nFrustration and anger mounted across Northern California as Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state\u2019s largest utility, began the third round of sweeping blackouts in a week aimed at preventing its electrical equipment from being fouled by wind-whipped branches or toppling and sparking wildfires.\n\nPG&E said Tuesday\u2019s blackouts would affect about 1.5 million people in some 30 counties including the Sierra foothills, wine country and San Francisco Bay Area. They included 1 million still without power from a shut-off over the weekend.\n\nWith no electricity for the fourth straight day, chef and caterer Jane Sykes realized she would have to throw out $1,000 worth of food, including trays of brownies, cupcakes and puff pastry.\n\nShe also had little hope of getting a good night\u2019s sleep \u2014 there was no way to run the machine she relies on to counter her apnea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think PG&E really thought this through,\u201d she lamented.\n\nPG&E officials said they understood the hardships caused by the safety blackouts but continued to insist they were necessary.\n\nIn wine country north of San Francisco, firefighters coped gusts while tackling a wildfire that has burned 86 homes and charred an area more than twice the size of San Francisco. About 90,000 buildings remained threatened. More than 150,000 people were under evacuation orders.\n\nWinds topped out at 70 mph (112 kph) north of San Francisco Bay and began to ease early Wednesday, but forecasters said fire danger would remain because of continuing breezes and very dry air.\n\nIn Southern California, Santa Ana winds developed more slowly Wednesday than expected but were topping 50 mph (80 kph) in some areas before dawn.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the strongest winds were to the west of the section of Los Angeles where a wildfire destroyed a dozen homes on Monday.\n\nAbout 9,000 people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and LeBron James, remained under evacuation orders.\n\nThat fire was caused when a dry branch from a eucalyptus tree was flung 30 feet (9 meters) by high winds into a city Department of Water and Power line, which short-circuited and sparked, the utility and Fire Department announced Tuesday.\n\nThe power line had been operating safely and the DWP had cut away brush and trees from around the line, officials said.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti called it an \u201cact of God.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service called an extreme red flag warning for much of Southern California through Thursday evening, with some wind gusts reaching 80 mph (128.74 kph). It could be the strongest wind event in years.\n\nCoupled with tinder-dry brush and low humidity, they could blow the smoldering fire back to life and spread embers to start new blazes, authorities warned.\n\nSouthern California Edison, which had previously made safety shutoffs and then restored power, cut power to 38,000 customers and warned that it could black out more than 300,000 customers, or some 600,000 people.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Edison announced in a quarterly earnings report that it was \u201clikely\u201d its equipment caused last year\u2019s Woolsey Fire, which killed three people and destroyed hundreds of homes in a swatch stretching from north of Los Angeles south through Malibu to the sea.\n\nNo deaths were reported from the current fires but weekend gusts may have claimed three lives. A 55-year-old homeless woman was crushed by a falling tree during high winds Sunday at a Santa Cruz campsite and a couple was killed the same day in a remote area of Madera County when a tree fell on their Jeep, which then crashed.\n\nAcross Northern California, people who weren\u2019t facing another day as fire refugees were worried about charging cellphones and electric vehicles, finding gasoline and cash, staying warm and keeping their food from spoiling.\n\nSome ended up at centers set up by PG&E where people could go to power their electronics and get free water, snacks, flashlights and solar lanterns.\n\nIn Placer County, Angel Smith relied on baby wipes and blankets to keep her 13-month-old son Liam warm and clean. The family has been without power since Saturday night and cannot draw well water without electricity.\n\nShe ran a cord from her neighbors\u2019 generator to keep her phone and tablet charged so the two could watch movies. Temperatures were expected to drop below freezing overnight in parts of Northern California.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part about this for me has been making sure I keep my son warm as it gets cold here,\u201d Smith said.\n\nPG&E, which is in bankruptcy after its equipment was blamed for a string of disastrous fires over the past three years, including a blaze that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people, has said its foremost concern is public safety.\n\nBut Gov. Gavin Newsom and top utility regulators have accused the company of mismanaging its power system and failing for decades to make the investments needed to ensure it\u2019s more durable. He and others have also complained that the utility has botched the outages by not keeping the public adequately informed.\n\nPG&E Corp. President Bill Johnson says he talked to Newsom Tuesday and told him he agreed with his suggestion that the company give credits to customers who\u2019ve been hit by pre-emptive power shut-offs. Newsom had suggested $100 per household, or $250 per business.\n\nJohnson said the utility has agreed to provide a \u201cone-time bill credit\u201d for people impacted by an Oct. 9 power cutoff that affected some 2 million people. But he didn\u2019t confirm a figure, saying the mechanics had yet to be worked out.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to move forward with a one-time bill credit for customers impacted by that event.\u201d", "description": "(AP) \u2014 Californians find themselves facing winds, wildfires, and darkness from yet another power outage that hit more than 1 million people.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19303153750981-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
