Isis members and affiliates are reported to have escaped prisons and detainment camps in the days following the Turkish incursion into Syria \u2013 where they were previously guarded by Kurdish soldiers.\n\nMr McConnell\u2019s attack, which does not mention the president by name and only refers to Mr Trump by his title once, is reported to have followed a phone call between the senate majority leader and the vice president Mike Pence.\n\n\u201cThe combination of a US pullback and the escalating Turkish-Kurdish hostilities is creating a strategic nightmare for our country\u201d, Mr McConnell added. \u201cEven if the five-day cease-fire announced Thursday holds, events of the past week have set back the United States\u2019 campaign against the Islamic State and other terrorists.\n\n\u201cUnless halted, our retreat will invite the brutal Assad regime in Syria and its Iranian backers to expand their influence.\n\n\u201cAnd we are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email

Senators would have the opportunity to debate our interests and strategy in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe Senate stepped up. A bipartisan supermajority of 70 senators supported an amendment I wrote to emphasize these lessons. It stated our opposition to prematurely exiting Syria or Afghanistan, reemphasized the need for sustained U.S. leadership to fight terrorists, and urged that we continue working alongside allies and local forces.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately\u201d, he added, \u201cthe administration\u2019s recent steps in Syria do not reflect these crucial lessons\u201d.\n\nIt comes as a fragile ceasefire continues to hold along the Turkish border following agreement between Mr Erdogan and Mr Pence in Ankara on Thursday to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw from the north of Syria.\n\nTurkey's defence ministry said on Saturday there had been 14 \"provocative attacks\" from Syria in the past 36 hours but said it was continuing to coordinate closely with the United States.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces accused Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies of shelling civilian areas there.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "The Senate\u2019s most senior Republican Mitch McConnell has called the president\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria a \u201cgrave strategic mistake\u201d in a direct attack on Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy actions.
