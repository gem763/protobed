It involves brain', he added.\n\nFor many years The Lady magazine (above) has advertised staff for high society households\n\nMr Budworth highlighted that butler training will be a small part of the business and said that other courses will target roles such as 'gardeners, grooms and chalet girls'.\n\nHe said that everyone knew of the Norland nannies but that there was no official certification for the training of domestic staff.\n\nBylaugh Hall was designed by the son of Sir Charles Barry, Charles Barry Jr.\n\nHe was the architect responsible for both the Palace of Westminster and Highclere Castle.\n\nHighclere Castle had been the original inspiration behind Downton Abbey.\n\nThe news of the training academy comes at a difficult time for the magazine. Last week its editor Sam Taylor, resigned in protest of the title moving from its historic Covent Garden office to Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.\n\nIt comes at a time in which many magazine are struggling to stay in print due to the competition of online media.\n\nMr Budworth said he feels the academy will be able to help the business move from 'modest loss to modest profit'.\n\nAt present The Lady has a circulation of around 23,000. The price of an issue is \u00a35.75 and it recently switched from a weekly, to a twice monthly publication date.\n\nBen Budworth and former editor of The Lady Rachel Johnson pictured at the book launch party for Diary of the Lady\n\nIts new editor Maxime Frith has said she wants to turn The Lady into a 'Grazia magazine for a different generation'.\n\nShe said the team had a choice to stay in central London and let the magazine die, or to move to the new Borehamwood and carry on.\n\nMr Budworth had previously bought out The Lady from his mother Julia and his three brothers and has since had full control of the title.", "description": "Based in a 19th century country house dubbed as Norfolk's Downton Abbey, the new business will run various courses for those wanting to serve the rich and famous.
