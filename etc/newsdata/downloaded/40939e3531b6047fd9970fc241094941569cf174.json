He was cleanly shaven in contrast to the long beard he had grown while holed up in Ecuador's embassy.\n\nAssange, 48, faces 18 counts in the U.S. including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades in prison if convicted.\n\nAustralian-born Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.\n\nAdmirers have hailed Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech.\n\nHis detractors have painted him as a dangerous figure complicit in Russian efforts to undermine the West and U.S. security, and dispute that he is a journalist.\n\nWikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.\n\nIn 2012, he took refuge in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes which he denied, saying he believed he would ultimately be sent on to the United Sates.\n\nHe was dragged from the embassy in April after seven years and given a 50-week jail term for skipping bail. That sentence was completed but he remains in prison while his extradition case continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; writing by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Alistair Smout)", "description": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared in a London court on Monday for a hearing on whether he should be extradited to the United States to face spying charges.
