They are ambitious targets that would be consistent with Netflix Inc's <NFLX.O> early progress, and in the mid-range of Disney+, Walt Disney Co's <DIS.N> Netflix rival, set to launch on Nov. 12.\n\nWarnerMedia hopes this service will get a boost in 2021 when it launches an advertising-supported option at a lower cost, insiders said.\n\nAfter it launches the ad-supported option, the company will add live programming on HBO Max.\n\nA long-term goal for HBO Max is to help AT&T retain wireless subscribers, according to executives, and also allow the company to pair wireless and DirecTV satellite data to learn more about consumers -- and in turn, charge higher rates to advertisers.\n\nAs one of the final entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max faces a tough competitive landscape. Although the Warner Brothers archive includes thousands of films and TV series like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo,\u201d it does not have the same brand awareness as Disney properties like Pixar or Marvel.\n\nPrice could also be an obstacle: HBO Max is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 the company charges for HBO -- significantly more than competing services from Apple Inc <AAPL.O> ($4.99) and Disney ($6.99), and slightly higher than the standard $12.99 Netflix plan.\n\nSelling HBO Max by piggybacking off the entrenched HBO service has its own challenges. Stankey wants to convert HBO's 35 million U.S. subscriber base, which includes the 10 million customers AT&T controls, to HBO Max. Doing so involves renegotiating deals with current pay TV providers, who may be wary of helping AT&T snatch their video customers.\n\nAnd while AT&T executives believe that HBO Max could reduce churn on its cell phone business to boost profits, the link may not be that clear.\n\n\"AT&T hasn't seen any more improvement (in churn) with wireless/video bundling than Verizon has seen without it,\" said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.\n\n\n\n\n\nPATH TO GROWTH\n\nAT&T, saddled with $162 billion in debt, faces a litany of challenges. Activist investor Elliott Management has expressed skepticism about Stankey, considered the heir apparent to CEO Randall Stephenson.\n\nElliott is pressuring AT&T to justify its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner -- now called WarnerMedia -- which it finalized in February, and to consider unwinding its $48.5 billion purchase of DirecTV, which has rapidly bled subscribers.\n\n\"The success of HBO Max is built on the ability for the company to rationalize why (the companies that AT&T bought) all belong together,\" said Stankey earlier this month.\n\nWarnerMedia will announce HBO Max pricing and details on Oct. 29. In interviews with Reuters, Stankey and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and Direct-to-Consumer, spelled out a plan to aggressively expand HBO\u2019s base.\n\nThe key to that growth is to continue providing content in the style of HBO -- the company defines that as \"quality\"; industry watchers invariably say \"sexy\" or \"edgy\" -- to its current over-40 viewers, while expanding to a younger audience that is used to streaming content and does not want to pay for cable.\n\n\"We know there's 75 million people in the range from two to young adults that are available to us as potential new subscribers that aren't part of the HBO universe already,\" said Greenblatt.\n\nStory continues", "description": "WarnerMedia executives want \"Circe\" to unleash a different power: attracting young viewers to the company's belated entry in the streaming-video war.
