In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don\u2019t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.\n\nSince July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans, and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump\u2019s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10).\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS\n\nAmong voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.\n\nA lot has happened since the July Fox poll on impeachment -- namely, the launch of an impeachment inquiry in the House following allegations Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens\u2019 dealings in that country. The 9-point increase in support for impeachment since July, however, doesn\u2019t appear to be based solely on the latest allegations. To that point, more Democrats favor impeaching Trump (85 percent) than consider his call with Ukraine\u2019s president an impeachable offense (76 percent). The same holds true among independents: 39 percent favor impeachment, while 30 percent describe the Ukraine call as impeachable.\n\nThe 4-in-10 voters opposing impeachment give a variety of reasons, including: Trump did nothing wrong (21 percent), it is politically motivated (20 percent), and don\u2019t believe allegations (15 percent).\n\nApproval of Trump\u2019s job performance is down a couple points to 43 percent, while 55 percent disapprove. Last month, it was 45-54 percent. Currently, 86 percent of Republicans approve compared to 89 percent in September.\n\nSome 51 percent of voters think the Trump administration is more corrupt than previous administrations, up from 46 percent last month.\n\nBy a 66-25 percent margin, voters say it is generally inappropriate for Trump to ask foreign leaders to investigate political rivals.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, 17 percent believe it was appropriate. Most either describe it as an impeachable offense (43 percent) or as inappropriate but not impeachable (27 percent).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has called the Ukraine phone call \u201cperfect.\u201d Even some Republicans aren\u2019t convinced: 9 percent say it was an impeachable offense, 38 percent inappropriate but not impeachable, and 36 percent appropriate.\n\nOverall, by an 11-point margin, more voters believe Trump is \u201cgetting what he deserves\u201d rather than that the impeachment inquiry is driven by \u201cpeople out to get him.\u201d\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment, by a 3-point margin, more thought \u201cpeople were out to get\u201d him than believed Clinton was \u201cgetting what he deserved.\u201d\n\nLEGAL EXPERTS WEIGH IN AS WHITE HOUSE OBJECTS TO INQUIRY\n\nMeanwhile, voters think President Trump is just out for himself. Fifty-five percent overall and 18 percent of Republicans say he is doing what\u2019s best for Trump. Thirty-nine percent think he puts the country first.\n\nThirty-eight percent find the situation surrounding Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine extremely troubling, while 19 percent say the same about the allegations about Biden and his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nWashington leaders remain unpopular\n\nNegative views outnumber positive views for the impeachment players.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s personal favorability rating is under water by 6 points (42 percent favorable vs. 48 percent unfavorable). Still, that\u2019s a new high, and gives her the highest favorable rating of Capitol Hill leadership tested in the poll.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) is also viewed more negatively than positively by 6 points (27-33), although 4 voters in 10 are unable to rate him.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is in negative territory by 23 points (26-49) and 25 percent can\u2019t rate him. Voters have a negative view of both Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani by 22 points (31-53) and Attorney General William Barr by 14 points (24-38).\n\nTrump\u2019s popularity ticked up a point since the inquiry: 43-56 percent vs. 42-56 percent in August.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s ratings roughly match Trump\u2019s: 41 percent favorable, 54 percent unfavorable. The previous Fox News poll showed her at 40-57 percent in June 2017.\n\nVice President Mike Pence stands at 40-49 percent compared to 39-48 percent two months ago.\n\nTrump has an 84 percent favorable among Republicans compared to 70 percent for Pence and 43 percent for McConnell, while 69 percent of Democrats have a favorable view of Pelosi.\n\nMore have a positive rather than a negative view of the Democratic Party by 2 points (49 favorable vs. 47 unfavorable), while the Republican Party is under water by 15 (40-55). Part of that is explained by more Democrats (85 percent favorable) viewing their party positively than Republicans do theirs (79 percent favorable).\n\nVoters are inclined to see the motives of Republican lawmakers as more political. By a 3-point margin, more think congressional Democrats truly believe Trump committed an impeachable offense than say Democrats just want to hurt him politically.\n\nOn the other side, by a 23-point margin, more think congressional Republicans just want to protect Trump politically than say GOP lawmakers sincerely believe what he did is not impeachable.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOverall, voters remain dissatisfied with the job Congress is doing: 21 percent approve, while 63 percent disapprove. In May, it was 21-66 percent.\n\nConducted October 6-8, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,003 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.
