The party needs to capture nine more seats next year to take control for the first time since 2002. The state Senate is expected to remain in Republican hands.\n\nTaking over the state House would allow Democrats to block Republicans from drawing a decade\u2019s worth of friendly state and federal district maps after the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\n\u201cTexas is shaping up to be one of our top targets in 2020,\u201d said Jessica Post, chairwoman of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nThe group has committed $100,000 in early money, out of more than $2.5 million for battleground states, to help the state party build a digital fundraising operation and recruit candidates, Post said. It plans to spend more than $50 million nationwide in 2020, five times the 2010 budget.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump puts Texas into play for Democrats. He\u2019s a liability for Republican candidates,\u201d said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Houston\u2019s Rice University. While he and other analysts do not expect Trump to lose the state next year, which he won by 9 points in 2016, they forecast a wave of Republican losses in smaller state races.\n\nIn what Democrats have gleefully termed the \u201cTexodus,\u201d five Texas Republican U.S. House incumbents have announced their retirement, including Representative Will Hurd, the only Republican to represent a district on the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nThe Democratic speaker of the U.S. House, Nancy Pelosi, has said Texas is \u201cground zero\u201d for her party in 2020, and the party\u2019s congressional campaign arm opened a field office in Austin, the state capital.\n\nThe independent electoral analysts at the Cook Political Report already rate one vacant seat as likely to flip to Democrats, with two other suburban Republican-held districts considered toss-ups.\n\nErica DiBella, a Houston-area librarian, is the kind of voter Democrats are hoping to sway. A married mother of two, she has been a registered Republican since her teenage years.\n\nBut she is opposed to Trump\u2019s education and immigration policies and said she ranked candidates by their affiliation with the president.\n\n\u201cFor most candidates that say they align with Trump, that\u2019s going to be a red flag for me,\u201d said DiBella, 43.\n\nSUBURBAN SHIFT\n\nDiscontent with Trump in Texas\u2019 suburban areas, once a Republican stronghold, coupled with the state\u2019s fast-growing Hispanic population and an influx of college-educated liberals from other states, is paving the way for Democratic gains, a dozen party officials, political strategists and academics said in interviews.\n\n\u201cBecause Texas Republicans are currently too lackadaisical ... it is the down-ballot Republican officeholders who will likely suffer most in 2020,\u201d said Ford O\u2019Connell, a Republican strategist and a Texas native.\n\nIn an ironic twist for Republicans, analysts say Texas is attracting liberal state voters because of its low cost of living - it has no state income tax, a feature long prized by conservatives.\n\nThe Texas secretary of state estimates 525,000 people have moved to the state annually over the past eight years. The Democratic-leaning Dallas and Houston metropolitan areas have each added more than a million residents since the 2010 U.S. Census, according to government estimates, more than any other cities in the country.\n\nSome long-term demographic trends also appear to favor Democrats.\n\nThe rapidly growing Latino population will represent the majority of the state\u2019s residents by 2022, state officials estimate. Only 20 percent of the state\u2019s Hispanics identify as Republican, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.\n\nREPUBLICAN PUSHBACK\n\nRepublicans are mobilizing to push back against Democratic inroads.\n\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee said earlier this month it would launch multimillion-dollar investments in Texas and other states to retain control of state legislatures.\n\n\u201cIf our friends at the DLCC believe that $50 million will buy them legislative majorities in states they\u2019ve been unable to win for the last decade, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll outraise them, outwork them and beat them,\u201d said RSLC spokesman Dave Abrams.\n\nRepublicans say Trump, far from acting as a drag on his party\u2019s fortunes, will energize base voters to come out in force.\n\nRepublican donors have formed Engage Texas, a super PAC focused on registering new Republican voters. The group has raised more than $9.6 million, according to federal elections records.\n\nOn Monday, the state Democratic Party said it would seek to register 2.6 million new voters in 2020.\n\nDemocrats can win by focusing on \u201ckitchen table\u201d issues, including jobs and the economy, as well as criminal justice reform and climate change, said Lina Hidalgo, who holds the top administrative post in Harris County, the state\u2019s largest county.\n\nHidalgo plans to meet with Democratic presidential campaign staff members the day after the debate to share strategies from her 2018 race, when she ousted a popular Republican.\n\n\u201cIf you show folks what government can do, they\u2019ll come out to vote,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cAnd it just so happens that the party addressing people\u2019s needs is the Democratic Party.\u201d", "description": "While 10 Democratic presidential contenders debate in Houston on Thursday, the party is eyeing gains farther down the ballot in Texas next year in races for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislature, party strategists and political experts say.", "authors": ["Ernest Scheyder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428645968&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0QM", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
