Who\u2019s pulling the strings behind the scenes? And who are the people shaping what it means to be Australian today?\n\nThese are the three questions that inform our overt, covert and cultural power lists. Now in its 19th year, The Australian Financial Review Magazine's annual Power issue seeks to be the definitive analysis of who\u2019s really running the show, and what undercurrents are shifting the rules of politics, business and culture.\n\nThe cover of AFR Magazine's 2019 Power issue. Louie Douvis\n\nThe Power issue is a huge exercise which starts in June when we select our power panellists: 14 in total and all of them esteemed in their various fields, including politics and business as well as sport, film, television and the arts. Our panellists join us in our Sydney offices to nominate, discuss, debate and decide who goes onto our overt, covert and cultural power lists. Meanwhile our experts from within the AFR newsroom draw up our sector power lists: business, investment banking, property, technology, law, consulting and education.\n\nAfter the lists are decided, our award-winning art directors and photographers take fresh portraits of the country\u2019s most powerful people. In the case of Scott Morrison, that involved photographer Dom Lorrimer following him on a typical day in Canberra, starting with breakfast at The Lodge. A few weeks later senior photographer Louie Douvis dropped into an NRL match at Shark Park in Morrison's electorate south of Sydney to capture the Prime Minister in his natural habitat \u2013 surrounded by Cronulla fans.", "description": "Go behind the scenes on AFR Magazine's most logistically challenging issue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2364%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_369/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a5ae6cfbe0097b0421fbd96adec544bd44354ab1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
