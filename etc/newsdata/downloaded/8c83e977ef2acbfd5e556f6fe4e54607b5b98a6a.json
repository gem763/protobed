If Hunter Biden isn\u2019t a public figure, deserving of fair comment and criticism, then no one is, not even the sitting president.\n\nThree months ago, Hunter literally flexed for a photographic spread in the New Yorker. He gave the magazine an extensive interview for a very lengthy profile that asked in the headline, \u201cWill Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father\u2019s Campaign?\u201d\n\nAnd that was voluntary.\n\nHere are two headlines from national newspapers:\n\n\u201cThe Hunter Biden story is a troubling tale of privilege,\u201d Washington Post, Oct. 4, 2019.\n\n\u201cTiptoeing Around Hunter Biden,\u201d New York Times, Oct. 10, 2019.\n\nOn Saturday, one day after Todd\u2019s ignorant commentary on journalistic ethics, Hunter appeared for an on-camera interview with ABC News.\n\nNever in history has there been a more public non-public figure than Hunter Biden, except maybe every single journalist who begins a news package with, \u201cI never sought to be part of the story\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat Todd meant was: I don\u2019t like that President Trump has had an effective political attack on Joe Biden, which happens to implicate his own profiteering, drug-addled son.\n\nYes, there\u2019s a there there. Nobody can honestly say that Joe Biden, while he was vice president, wasn\u2019t aware of or passively participating in Hunter's self-enrichment. Hunter's sweet business interests conveniently coincided with his father\u2019s political engagement with Ukraine and China.\n\nTrump was brilliant in his remarks about it last week during a campaign rally in Minneapolis, and it got people really upset. \u201cJoe\u2019s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBy the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?\u201d\n\nWell, there he is! He\u2019s having a sit-down on network television, just like so many non-public figures do!\n\n\u201cWhere is Hunter?\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI want to see Hunter asked this question: Hunter, you know nothing about energy. You know nothing about China. You know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you\u2019re a loser. Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter?\u201d\n\nThe $1.5 billion figure, according to a report last week in the New York Post, is a reference to a funding goal that Hunter\u2019s business, in partnership with a Chinese company, had set in 2013, the same year that he had flown to China with his dad aboard Air Force Two and met with business associates. A photograph from the trip shows both Bidens posing with the Chinese businessmen on a golf course.\n\nNormal person: Hmm, interesting. Can I hear more about that from the most powerful person in the world?\n\nChuck Todd: Nah, no need! Hunter Biden isn\u2019t a public figure! You don't need to know about this.\n\nIt\u2019s always a trip when the national media try to save their audiences from Trump by refusing to quote him or air his rallies. That's invariably a hint that they\u2019re hiding something very good.\n\nRemember when Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty said earlier this year that she would \u201cpledge\u201d that she would \u201cnever again quote, repeat or otherwise dignify any of the asinine nicknames that President Trump gives his adversaries\u201d? Remember when Fox News refused to air a fantastic and factually accurate ad about immigrant-related crime in the heat of the 2018 midterm election? Remember when the liberal HuffPost in 2015 said it was relegating all coverage of Donald Trump to the \u201centertainment\u201d section?\n\nOn his show Friday, Chuck Todd said that Trump\u2019s \u201cattack\u201d on Hunter was \u201cremarkable\u201d but that he couldn\u2019t \u201cin good conscience amplify those attacks\u201d because they \u201cseemed to cross a line.\u201d We know what that means. It means that Trump hit a little too close to home. All of Todd\u2019s viewers should want to find out what he said.", "description": "To get a sense of just how desperately liberals in the media are trying to lend cover to Joe Biden and his 49-year-old son Hunter Biden, you need only have watched 90 seconds of MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec6b91c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2142x1125+0+99/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F55%2F55%2F8a379cd74da68c326f8c2febb976%2Fhunter-biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
