This is the point, after all. Campaigns raise money to spend money, and they spend money with the intent of improving their position in the field. We are admittedly still early enough in this election cycle that campaigns will want to sit on some cash as the primaries and caucuses approach. But campaigns are also spending, with leading candidates laying out more than $182 million over the three-month period from July 1 to Sept. 30. That\u2019s about $2 million a day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut, for what? What did that spending actually get them? Well, it depends on the candidate.\n\nTake Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example. Her campaign reported spending just under $19 million over those three months. In return, Warren saw an impressive 9.6-point gain in the polls, according to the average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHere\u2019s how her position in the polls shifted relative to where she was June 30. We\u2019ve overlaid her performance on everyone else\u2019s \u2014 with everyone\u2019s spending indicated by the width of the line representing poll movement.\n\nCompare Warren with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders\u2019s position in the polls remained about even over those three months \u2014 and he paid several million dollars more than Warren for the privilege.\n\nThese charts don\u2019t tell the whole story, of course. Spending and improvements in the polls aren\u2019t directly linked, so it\u2019s overly facile to expect more spending to lead to better polling. Nor do campaigns necessarily want to burn through money to see a big increase in the polls right now; for a campaign like that of former vice president Joe Biden, for example, spending less to remain in the lead, as he was on July 1, isn\u2019t a terrible idea.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not exactly what Biden did. His standing in the polls moved around a lot, which was in part a function of his relative polling strength coming into the period and in part a function of at least one iffy debate performance, but he ended up shedding a few points while nearly matching Warren\u2019s spending.\n\nIt could have been worse: He could have been Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Her campaign surged at the beginning of the quarter after a strong debate against Biden, but ended up spending $14 million in the process of dropping a critical five points in the polling average.\n\nYou don\u2019t always want to spend more just to gain a few points, but you certainly don\u2019t want to do this.\n\nButtigieg, by the way, ended up having a quarter somewhat like Sanders\u2019s. He spent a lot \u2014 $18 million \u2014 and didn\u2019t really go anywhere. That\u2019s actually worse for Buttigieg, though, since he was only at 6 percent in the average coming into the quarter.\n\nAnd then there is billionaire activist Tom Steyer. No candidate raised more money last quarter, with Steyer pulling in nearly $50 million. Of course, about $48 million was his own. And he spent nearly all of it \u2014 to see his poll numbers soar by 0.6 points. It was enough to get him on the debate stage Tuesday, but it\u2019s probably not going to do much more for him than that.\n\nThe exact opposite of Steyer was tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Yang only spent about $4 million, but he gained several points in the polls anyway. He\u2019s not a front-runner by any stretch, but he\u2019s gaining ground and not spending a ton of money doing so.\n\nIn fact, if we look at the change in polling as a function of money spent, Yang\u2019s modest spending and modest poll improvement was about as efficient as Warren\u2019s bigger gains and bigger buys. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro were somewhat less efficient, but still gained some ground. Harris, of course, stands out in her own way.\n\nThe moral of the story here is probably best exemplified by the last three columns on that graph. Steyer spent an outrageous amount and gained 0.01 points for every million dollars he spent. Warren gained about 0.5 points for each of the millions she spent \u2014 as did Yang, even though he spent far fewer millions.\n\nIn other words, how much you spend isn\u2019t necessarily going to determine what you get in return. By extension, how much you raise, which determines how much you can spend, doesn\u2019t either.\n\nUnless you only raise $5. That does in fact determine how you\u2019re going to fare moving forward.\n\nAD", "description": "A look at third-quarter spending relative to the polls.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/78ju3VmMDmk5mVozv1HEOa5Fkb4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OAHDIYXP3AI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
