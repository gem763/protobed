(Image: Toho)\n\nSend help, I am in love with every frame of this trailer.\n\nThe very first look we got at Lupin III: The First already dazzled with its incredible CG take on the wild world of Monkey Punch\u2019s beloved gentleman thief manga series (and the various animated versions it has gone on to inspire).\n\nThis latest trailer for Takashi Yamazaki\u2019s movie, released by Toho this week, is much the same. But as well as just looking completely gorgeous, it actually gives us a little more insight on what fans can expect out of Lupin\u2019s latest, greatest heist.\n\nIt turns out that Lupin\u2019s been hired by a mysterious woman named Leticia to go after the Bresson Diary \u2014 a legendary treasure that not even Lupin\u2019s famous predecessor (his grandfather, or so Lupin has always claimed), the master thief Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, could steal. Bresson was actually the psuedonym of one of the characters in Maurice LeBlanc\u2019s collection of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin short stories, Ars\u00e8ne Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes, which... well, you can guess who LeBlanc was aping there, can\u2019t you?\n\nAnyway, fun literary references aside, Lupin III: The First looks like everything you\u2019d want out of a new Lupin adventure, even if you\u2019re concerned that the translation from manga and anime to 3D CG would rob the series of some of its distinct visual charm. Given how sumptuous this movie looks? That charm might be something not even a master thief like Lupin or his grandfather could steal!\n\nLupin III: The First is set for release in Japan December 6. Sadly, no international release has yet to be confirmed, so for now all we can do is just watch these gorgeous looking trailers on loop.", "description": "Send help, I am in love with every frame of this trailer.", "authors": ["David Nield", "Alex Choros"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/cjevkslaej77ywquy0ba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
